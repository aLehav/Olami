After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1929, Harlem Renaissance novelist Nella Larsen published “Passing,” a book that was revolutionary for its time. Focusing on two light-skinned Black women living in 1920s New York City, "Passing" tackled a myriad of underrepresented themes including racism, performative femininity, motherhood, class, and sexuality in a mere 93 pages. The book has since captivated countless people with its nuanced analysis of race and performative femininity, and British actress and first-time director Rebecca Hall, a white-passing biracial woman herself, was one such person. Her film adaptation, also titled “Passing,” premiered on Jan. 30 at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival.
Shot in black and white with a four by three aspect ratio, the film is reminiscent of 1920s American cinema, even though "Passing" is a story that would never have been shown on silver screens at its time. The smaller frame necessitated by the four by three ratio means that the contents within the frame carry an added purpose. They are there because Hall meant for them to be there.
The film stars “Sorry to Bother You” actress and Sundance alum Tessa Thompson as Irene Redfield, a refined, upper-class 1920s woman, who, while passing for white, runs into old friend Clare Kendry (Ruth Negga) doing the same. While both are Black women who can white-pass, they have chosen to live on opposite sides of the color line. Irene has a Black husband and lives in Harlem, while Clare marries a racist white man and dreams of returning to her roots.
Hall manages to capture the story's subtlety — forcing audiences to lean in and pay attention to the unseen and the unsaid. A prime example is the relationship between Irene and Clare: Irene is absolutely fixated on Clare, who, in turn, is overcome with a “wild desire,” but that intense desire is rarely explicitly shown. Thompson and Negga’s performances hone in on these subtextual elements without overplaying them — giving audiences more information with furtive glances than tension-laden dialogue — allowing viewers to be entranced solely by the infatuations and jealousies that color their friendship.
“Passing” pushes viewers to look beyond the superficial binaries presented by the plot — Black versus white, rich versus poor, powerful versus powerless — all of which are manifested in Clare's internal contradictions. She does not allow herself to be completely Black nor white, cunningly toying with the boundaries of each identity in whatever way suits her situation best. Her performance of whiteness is used not as a refusal of Blackness but rather as a way to cross the binary of rich and poor, powerful and powerless. Similarly, her relationship with Irene cannot be defined as merely platonic or sexual, rather someplace in between: a rekindled friendship, yes, but also tinged with the eroticism of mutual envy.
A process of translation is required to understand these binaries and where they’re broken, just as the black and white footage requires translation to understand what it’s depicting. And like the characters in the film, the footage isn’t truly defined by the binary of black or white — it’s gray. In a film about nuance and ambiguity, Hall’s stylistic decisions take on multiple shades of meaning.
While at a party, a white author asks Irene why she doesn’t white-pass like Clare does, to which she answers: “We’re all of us passing for something or another, aren’t we?”
Therein lies the driving force in "Passing." The women are never one thing or another, and instead are constantly caught in a game of appearances and performance — whether intentional or not. And in centering these intimate performances and their contradictions so skillfully, Hall gives Larsen’s timeless novel new life and dimension.

Across many cultures, the monarch butterfly is a powerful symbol. In Mexico, the butterfly arrives around the Day of the Dead and brings souls with it. In the United States, where the butterfly stops along its journey, the monarch has become a symbol for migration, being used across migrant justice campaigns in recent years. Just like the butterflies that lend themselves to its name, French Venezuelan filmmaker Alexis Gambis’s latest film “Son of Monarchs” — which premiered on January 29 at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival — is itself an embodiment of metamorphosis.
Both directed and written by Gambis, the film follows Mendel (Tenoch Huerta Mejía), a Mexican scientist living in New York who, enchanted from childhood by the monarch butterflies in his hometown of Angangueo in Michoacán, dedicates his biology career to mapping out the butterfly’s genetics. When he is called back to his small hometown in order to heal the wounds of his past, he is confronted with a need to reconsider his own physical and spiritual identity, compelling him to turn back to the Monarch butterflies for answers.
In focusing on Mendel, a scientist with spiritual roots back in Angangueo, the film is able to bridge the perceived divides between the two disparate ways of looking at the world: science and spirituality. An immigrant struggling to be fully happy in his adopted American home, Mendel’s role in the film is one of self-discovery. And yet neither spirituality nor science alone, neither Angangueo nor New York, provide true fulfillment to Mendel. Not until they are combined do they provide relief for Mendel from his despair and disconnect.
The film artfully focuses on the interconnectedness of science and spirituality. Mendel’s relationship to science is a spiritual one (looking through the microscope, for example, is depicted as an inherently spiritual act, as he turns inwards towards his work at moments of meditation and unease) and his relationship to spirituality is a scientific one (as a child growing up in Angangueo, he is filled with questions and hypotheses about the folklore taught to him).
Because it is driven largely by Mendel’s dissatisfaction with life as a New Yorker, “Son of Monarchs” also serves as a direct counter to the idea of an American dream or American utopia. Instead, the film makes a sweeping visual argument for the cyclical nature of migration. As Mendel spends the movie torn between Mexico and the United States both physically and mentally, “Son of Monarchs” toys with the idea that people should be able to move around frequently and explore different areas. The film also calls attention to what director Gambis referred to as the uniquely Latinx experience of eventually returning home to one’s family roots. Like the butterfly which needs constant migration to survive, Mendel only thrives when constantly moving between Mexico and the U.S., as Huerta Mejía shows through his captivatingly nuanced performance.
Notably, it is in Angangueo, not New York, that Mendel is able to begin the process of reconciling his spiritual and scientific identities, when he joins his childhood friend Vincente (Lazaro Gabino Rodriguez) in a ritual to say goodbye to the dead. Invented for the film through a process of improvisation by the film’s actors and non-actors from Michoacán, the ritual involves Mendel and others taking on animal personas, howling and growling into the mountainside. It is here that Mendel begins his metamorphosis into the titular monarch, a transformation compounded by the smooth sweeping shots mimicking the butterfly’s point of view.
Though that specific ritual wasn’t true to Mexican culture, the rest of the film’s depiction of Mexican life, inspired by Gambis’s own time in the country, is authentic without being kitschy or self-serving. Often sound design falls to the wayside when considering the experience that films create, but in “Son of Monarchs,” the soundscape created by sound editor Samuel Nacach, sound recordist Andrés Saldaña, and ADR recordist Luis Sumano is the root of its authenticity. The soundscape throughout the film is complex and layered, inviting viewers to immerse themselves in the scene. For example, when Mendel and his brother Simón first meet at the family house in Angangueo after their grandmother’s funeral, the sound of the Hail Mary being prayed in Spanish continues in the background, blending with the sound of music and cars outside and the rest of the large family going in and out of rooms in the background.
Through its experimental approach to sound and visuals and its complex storyline colored by magical realism, “Son of Monarchs” is a stunning exploration of what it is to be a Latinx immigrant in the U.S. Focusing on the intersections of science and spirituality to explore family and self, it tells a larger, almost universal story of growth and metamorphosis in the process.

Emmy-winning director Peter Nicks has been exploring the intersections of health, education, and criminal justice in the city of Oakland, California, for more than a decade. Over three films created in the past 10 years, he has chronicled the lives of the Oakland community as they relate to the public institutions intended to serve them, such as public hospitals, police departments, and public high schools.
His latest documentary “Homeroom,” which premiered on Jan. 29 at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival, represents the culmination of a decades-long project. The third and final film in an award-winning trilogy — including 2012’s “The Waiting Room” about healthcare in a public Oakland hospital and 2017’s “The Force” about the violence and reform in the Oakland Police — “Homeroom” focuses on a group of high school seniors in the tumultuous school year ending in Spring 2020.
Nicks’s directorial input in “Homeroom” — like in the other installments of his Oakland trilogy — creates a movie that forwards politics of class, racial, and social justice without engaging with them directly. His cinéma vérité style means that his own biases are hidden behind a veil of fly-on-the-wall filmmaking, but his choice to follow activist students and include powerful conversations on race, impoverishment, and education reform presents a clear path for the film to unfold. By giving the students the microphone, Nicks clandestinely shows his endorsement for the activism they take up, painting them as inspiring (if imperfect) voices in America’s shifting political context.
The film follows the small group of students as they navigate a series of hurdles in their quest to become high school graduates. Some of the hurdles could have happened in any year: the rigor of college applications, the stress of a broken school system, and the instability that comes with some low-income living conditions. Other hurdles, like attending school virtually during both a global pandemic, were largely unimaginable before 2020.
Nicks’s love letter to the spirit of Oakland finds its strength in its subject matter: the young community leaders taking up the mantle to better their city and its institutions.
Taken at face value, Nicks’s characteristic cinéma vérité style can be seen as an honest depiction of normal school life for teenagers growing up in one of the most diverse cities in the U.S. — but the film is truly made extraordinary by the struggles Oakland High School’s students face and their perseverance in the face of back-to-back injustices. However, as one of the film’s main subjects, Dwayne Davis, said in a Q&A session following the film’s premiere, these issues of racism and broken institutions are things students across the country deal with and are not unique to those featured in the film.
“Homeroom” makes that distinction clear as well. Rather than filtering the students’ lives and interactions, their flaws and complexity come through. The film depicts humanizing, imperfect moments through the students’ social media posts and vulnerable conversations about failing a test or having an unstable home, for example. Nicks highlights their complexities with honest, lightly-edited scenes, breaking from a media narrative that has sought to prop up young people in the pandemic only as saintly martyrs of an unprecedented school year.
This depiction is also aided by Nicks’s fly-on-the-wall approach to documentary filmmaking. Through a mix of cinematic footage following the students in their day to day lives as highschoolers and archival footage pulled from video diaries, Snapchat stories, Instagram posts, and TikToks, Nicks shows the story not only through his own directorial eye but also through the eyes of the subjects themselves.
While the cinéma vérité style means that Nicks doesn’t employ an explicit editorial voice nor make any outright political statements, the scenes he chooses to focus on and the conversations he draws attention to — on a myriad of subjects ranging from student leader Denilson Garibo’s immigration status to the Black Panthers and systemic racism — help to center the film in much-needed context.
In one of the many classroom scenes, a student tells her teacher under her breath that “everything is political” when he reminds her that class discussions are supposed to remain apolitical. In the same vein, while Nicks’s approach attempts to remain outside of politics, merely reflecting what the director sees in front of him, the result is something intrinsically rooted in politics and institutions beyond the public school system.
If nothing else, the film is a necessary time capsule. A window into the radical and tumultuous year that was 2020, “Homeroom” is the story of a diverse community during a critical moment in its history that meaningfully centers the moment’s catalysts in the storytelling process.

Easily one of the most recognizable names in dance history, the late Alvin Ailey spent his decades-long career breaking the mold of modern dance. Through his famous Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, Ailey infused the genre he helped create with Black influence, innovation, strength, and beauty. Throughout his life, the legendary dancer faced racism and homophobia, as well as addiction and mental illness. These experiences — “blood memories” as Ailey called them — found cathartic expression in Ailey’s signature ballet and revolutionary ode to the Black cultural experience, “Revelations.” First performed in 1960, “Revelations” was both an ode to Black liberation and a genre-defining template for modern dance’s ability to be a language for the oppressed.
On January 30, just one day before the 61st anniversary of Ailey’s iconic masterpiece, award-winning filmmaker Jamila Wignot premiered her latest film “Ailey” at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival. Through a blend of archival footage, never-before-seen audio interviews, and interviews with Ailey’s friends and collaborators, the film paints a compelling portrait of the modern dance pioneer, interlacing Ailey’s past with the company’s present and the lead-up to a performance dedicated to his life.
The film showcases dozens of Ailey’s performances and choreography, from his groundbreaking “evening-long saga of the Black experience, “Revelations,” to the last piece he ever choreographed.
“Sometimes your name becomes bigger than yourself,” choreographer and dancer Carmen de Lavallade says in the film. “Alvin Ailey. Do you really know who that is or what that is?”
The goal of “Ailey” is to answer that very question — to uncover the artist behind the art — and it does so with poetic prowess. Using interviews with Ailey and his contemporaries as a driving force for the film, “Ailey” allows the choreographer and his loved ones to tell his personal story, and complements that story with a collage of archival footage, footage of Ailey’s choreography, and a focus on Ailey’s legacy through the AAADT. Wignot amplifies and uplifts the beauty of Ailey’s movement, immortalizing it in a new medium.
By focusing, too, on hip-hop choreographer Rennie Harris’s dance interpretation of Ailey’s life in the present day, “Ailey” allows viewers to discover Ailey as the company’s dancers do. Cutting seamlessly between the 2018 choreographing process, footage of Ailey’s career, and footage of his childhood, the film drives home the idea of the dancer as a “historian,” as Harris says.
Indeed, Wignot drives home that very point for Ailey himself, presenting him as someone who used dance as a language to tell stories of the past and future. After the murder of Black Panther Chicago Chairman Fred Hampton, for example, Ailey used dance and movement as protest, creating the piece “Masekela Langage” as a way to draw parallels between apartheid South Africa and the race-fueled violence of 1960s Chicago.
Perhaps more than anything, though, “Ailey” is a necessary look at the artist behind the worldwide acclaim, and the ways that fame affected him behind the scenes. “Dance, it’s an enormous sacrifice,” Ailey says in one of the film’s many interviews with him. “You have to be possessed to do dance.”
By showing the struggles Ailey went through throughout his career — from being used as a puppet by the media due to his being a Black artist to having to suffer through AIDS alone without a gay community to support him — Wignot personifies Ailey in a way that feels both intimate and larger-than-life.
The film opens with the iconic actress and model Cicely Tyson presenting Alvin Ailey with honors from the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in 1988. “His is a choreography of the heart, bringing a whole new public to modern dance,” she says. “Alvin Ailey is Black. And he is universal…. And that’s his genius.”
Wignot’s genius comes from putting Ailey front and center. With its stunning collages of footage and sound, “Ailey” makes viewers feel both relieved that all these records of Ailey exist, and grateful that Jamila Wignot took the fragments and turned them into poetry.

Might it be possible that the end and beginning of the world rest at the lip of the ocean?
Watch serpentwithfeet traverse its shore on his new single and video for “Fellowship,” off the forthcoming album “DEACON” (out March 26), and the answer washes in on waves, a whispered, incantatory “yes.”
A warmth emanates through a xylophone and a plucky, bell-laden rhythm. Ambient synth (minor at the beginning, tantamount to serpentwithfeet’s characteristic melancholy) hovers underneath. The tambourine and hollow, clicky beat get the head moving before a word can be spoken. It’s immediately more than a dance party; one gets the feeling of being awoken in the middle of the night by those you love most as they venture with you toward the stars outside the sea. The floor under you becomes dislocated while you rush to the beach, witnessing incandescent, spectral light from the sky, and the song makes you run faster. Your center of gravity sways. By the chorus, the texture collages into uncontrollable, soft, group-party movement, so there’s no use ascribing language to the celebration; just turn it on.
The three voices and producers — serpentwithfeet and his scaly vibrato, Sampha and his rich, exquisitely muted falsetto, and the ad-libs of Lil Silva which pop in the back of the mix — assemble into the shape of a small choir. You can almost hear their laughter as they phrase the lyrics, which detail the minute moments (“Our obsession with Prosecco,” “Christmas films in July with you”) that come with being in your thirties, with a gentleness reserved for a Black queer positionality in which the structure of the world renders intimacy continually threatened.
“I’m spending less time worrying and more time recounting the love.” The influences here are poetic, owing to both of Danez Smith’s collections: “Don’t Call Us Dead” and “Homie” — whose curtain-call “acknowledgements” contains the stunning line, “at the end of the world, let there be you, my world.” There’s some Toni Morrison “Jazz” in there as well as a dash of Lucille Clifton’s “lucy and her girls” (“Lucy is the ocean / extended by / her girls”), which, altogether, form the composite of this moment for queer Black friendship and unending love. Listeners are placed in the center of their echo. It’s a salve; per Alice Walker, wound felt and medicine conjured in response.
Black queer playwright Donja R. Love’s “one in two” offers this line: “Don’t be far away.” In Kordae Jatafa Henry’s video, this is made visual: Over a scene of two lovers in billowing, translucent dress, the water moves as their faces do, in and out of a singular, so-near-breathtaking kiss. Their audience assumes the intermediary role between them, the world, and their love as they let the song inhabit the space created by the intersection. Fear scarcely has a place in these three and a half minutes, because if anything could will disaster away, and retrieve the glow of one’s chosen family, it’s this.
“I’m thankful for the love I share with my friends,” is an end-of-battle cry, even when the war wages so long it’s past understanding. And to fade out of the video, this lifted zone, serpentwithfeet and his lover turn away after an interlaced hug, wading knee-deep, hand in hand, out into the water.

Last December, Lil Wayne pled guilty to gun charges stemming from a 2019 FBI raid of his private jet and faced up to 10 years in prison. One month later, he was free — pardoned by former President Donald J. Trump — seemingly a result of his public support for the Trump campaign prior to the election.
The latest single from Weezy, “Ain't Got Time,” addresses his precarious legal situation with emotional depth and wit, without ever making explicit reference to Trump or the pardon.
Lil Wayne is solidly supported by warm production from veteran beat-making duo R!O & Kamo. The producing pair’s melodic approach is in line with their previous work on Wayne’s 2018 album “Tha Carter V” and collaborations with Meek Mill. The echoey bass on the track and absence of drums puts the spotlight directly on Lil Wayne’s delivery and lyricism.
The rapper does not rap for the entirety of the track, choosing to sing instead — perhaps a nod to the late Chicago rapper Juice WRLD, whom Lil Wayne mentions by name in the first verse: “RIP Juice WRLD wrote that on two cups.” Lil Wayne’s vocals sound great and are evidence of his versatility. He is just as capable of a singer as he is able to hop on a track with boom bap Buffalo rapper Benny the Butcher or Drake. The rapper’s crooning contrasts nicely with the feature from Fousheé, a former contestant on The Voice, whose voice is as smooth as Lil Wayne’s is hazy.
Beyond stylistic homage, the Juice WRLD shoutout speaks to Lil Wayne’s feelings on his own arrest and mortality. Just three weeks prior to Lil Wayne’s 2019 arrest, the FBI raided Juice WRLD’s private jet in Chicago, which resulted in the rapper’s accidental overdose. The similarity to and proximity of Juice WRLD’s death to Lil Wayne’s own situation is not lost on Weezy: “Pour out a lil juice for him, shit gave me goosebumps,” he sings.
Lil Wayne, now 38, also expresses fear over going to prison late in his career: “I just hope I ain’t get time because I ain’t got time.” It’s the most vulnerable he’s been on a song in awhile, and a welcome departure from the empty flexing on his other recent singles like “Kitty Talk (Remix)” with Quavo, City Girls, and Jack Harlow. Having received a second chance, Lil Wayne is ready to make the most of it.

Gijón, a post-industrial city on the Northwest coast of Spain, recently became the subject of a love letter that premiered at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival. “El Planeta” — the brainchild of artist Amalia Ulman who directed, produced, wrote, and starred in the film — is a comedic, feminist ode to the perennially gray city and to the uniqueness of mother-daughter relationships in the face of tragedy.
Shot in black and white (Ulman said in a post-screening Q&A that she doesn't believe Gijón looks good in color), the film follows main character Leo (Ulman), who, after her father’s death, leaves her life as a fashion student in London to return to her hometown of Gijón, where her mother, María (played by Ale Ulman, Amalia’s real-life mother), is on the verge of eviction. Drowning in debt, the two scheme their next meals by selling personal items online and running up tabs based on extensive lies and scams.
Already a family affair in terms of casting, Ulman’s “El Planeta” is also deeply personal. The film’s formal choices, for example — like Ulman’s use of unconventional, kitschy transitions in between scenes — are inspired directly by her art practice. As an installation, performance, and video artist, she often relies on pre-animated transitions, even using applications like PowerPoint in her video production. This is a practice Ulman translates into “El Planeta” in the form of eccentric star or square-shaped transitions between scenes. “El Planeta” is also semi-autobiographical, based in part on the Ulman duo’s experience getting evicted during Spain’s 2008 to 2014 financial crisis and in-part on a news story about mother-daughter scammers in Gijón.
Despite the outwardly hopeless premise of “El Planeta” — of two women attempting to live life to the fullest while knowing they’re close to losing it all — the tone never feels tragic. At the very least, it is not tragic in the sterile, martyrous, and melodramatic way in which tragedy is usually represented in film. Rather, Ulman satirizes it and the social systems which created it. No doubt that this treatment of tragedy is fueled in part by Ulman’s own experiences: She has no need to put it on a pedestal, so humanizes it instead.
Perhaps the most prominent way Ulman uses satire to humanize tragedy is the scenarios poking fun at the duo’s situation. For example, in an attempt to make some money and get out of their financial hole, Leo subjects herself to painfully awkward encounters with two men — one as a potential romantic partner, the other as a sugar daddy. And in both cases, the men are ridiculous. They’re out of touch, rude, and oblivious to the world around them to the point of absurdity. They’re made even more absurd when Ulman’s depiction of Leo and her mother reminds viewers of the financial struggle that forced Leo into that position in the first place. And still, under mountains of debt, Leo and her mother wear designer coats and worry about getting a “poor person’s body” from the lack of food in their fridge. Ulman doesn’t shame or belittle Leo and María for their priorities; she only shows them as they are, and in doing so, expertly calls the viewer’s attention to the two characters' contradictions.
It’s a fresh addition to the Sundance catalog by an up and coming, innovative filmmaker with an eye for art and aesthetics. Even though it’s filmed in black and white, “El Planeta” always feels vibrant and full of life. Leo’s enviable fashion and María’s increasingly unhinged lies undeniably add to that feeling. But what really makes the film truly memorable is the natural chemistry between María and Leo, who are lovable from start to finish.

To understand and appreciate Sabrina Carpenter’s recent single “Skin” requires a comprehensive knowledge of “Drivers License.” Last month, Olivia Rodrigo released her debut single titled “Drivers License.” Rodrigo, 17, is a singer and actress best known for her roles on the Disney Channel sitcoms “Bizaardvark” and “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series.”
To say that “Drivers License” was an immediate and prodigious success would be an understatement. Since its release, the song has shattered multiple records, including the biggest first week for a song on Apple Music and Spotify and the most single-day streams for a non-holiday song on Spotify. “Drivers License” has amassed enormous traction on TikTok and other social media platforms, inspiring trends and countless spoofs. Rodrigo is now the youngest singer in the United States to claim a number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100.
A driving factor (no pun intended) behind the success of “Drivers License” lies in its drama-soaked backstory. Rodrigo’s inspiration stems from teenage heartbreak — she admitted that the song details adolescent love gone wrong, though she remains ambiguous about the parties involved. Fans speculate that Rodrigo wrote the song following her breakup with “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series” co-star Joshua Bassett. According to Internet gossip, following their split, Bassett entered into a relationship with fellow Disney Channel star Sabrina Carpenter.
At its core, “Drivers License” is a sad song, a heartbreak anthem evocative of drippy pop stars like Lorde, Lana del Rey, and MARINA. The single conjures a typical teenage scene: when Rodrigo gets her license (hence the title) and drives through her neighboring suburbs, the moment becomes not one of euphoric bliss, but of loneliness and heartbreak. Suddenly, the empty passenger seat beside her speaks louder than the road ahead. The familiarity of this scene is part of what makes “Drivers License” so powerful for so many. Everyone, at one point or another, has been a teenager driving alone in their car, blasting music with the windows rolled down, ruminating on what might have been.
The story should have stopped there, but it didn’t.
Joshua Bassett, Rodrigo’s ex, released a song after “Drivers License” titled “Lie Lie Lie.” Officially, “Lie Lie Lie” has nothing to do with “Drivers License” or Rodrigo. In reality, the song’s lyrics include subtle hints such as “And you’re acting so innocent / Like I’m not the only one to blame.”
Even worse, Sabrina Carpenter released a song called “Skin.” Like Bassett, Carpenter formally maintains that “Skin” has nothing to do with “Drivers License.” Like “Lie Lie Lie,” “Skin” has some shady lyrics that suggest otherwise, such as “Maybe you didn’t mean it / Maybe ‘blonde’ was the only rhyme,” a direct reference to a lyric in “Drivers License.”
The problem here is not that Rodrigo never actually rhymed “blonde” with anything. Nor is it that “Lie Lie Lie” and “Skin” are bad songs, though now might be a good time to point out that they are, in fact, terrible. “Lie Lie Lie” is old-school Jonas Brothers made about ten times worse, 2000s pop transported twenty years into the future with music that lacks any sort of complexity and depth, a pathetic echo of its predecessors. “Skin” is so unabashedly awful that there are no words to do it justice. The song is as empty and immature as its premise, which is its real problem. Rather than attempting to be a song of any real worth, “Skin” seems to target a teenage girl for her success.
Bassett is 20, Carpenter is 21, and Rodrigo is 17. Bassett and Carpenter, three and four years older than Rodrigo, obviously did not receive the memo that TikTok — and the whole of the Internet — has already taken Rodrigo’s side. Sure, Carpenter released a statement asking her fans not to send Rodrigo hate, but anyone with a basic grasp of the Internet knows that if she really wanted to shield Rodrigo from the vitriol of diehard fans, she shouldn’t have released “Skin” in the first place. (Of course, given how bad “Skin” is, perhaps Carpenter shouldn’t have released it at all.)
The final lesson here is twofold. Firstly, seemingly targeting a 17-year-old girl for her success is not a good look. Secondly, when releasing a diss track, at least make sure that it’s a good one.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Life before Covid-19 feels like a century ago and yesterday at the same time. Everything is happening around us, but so little of it happens to us. It may be tempting to look backward to figure out how to feel during tumultuous periods, but art can more accurately reflect the true emotions of the past than a history textbook. Right now, Thomas Mann’s “The Magic Mountain” is that art. It gives a voice to those who are on uncertain terms with time itself.
By most accounts, the German Nobel Laurete’s novel is a difficult read. At over 700 pages, it is thick, dense, and occasionally a slog. Most translations leave much to be desired: The New York Times’ lede that the characters are “considerably closer to speaking English” in one edition is a backhanded compliment of the highest order. The final nail in the coffin is the novel’s prewar setting, one that feels alien enough for many cultural references to go unheeded. All of these are perfectly fine reasons not to read this book.
For its daunting length, Mann’s story is not that complicated. Hans Castorp, a young, clean-shaven man of privilege, visits his sick cousin Joachim at a sanatorium in the Swiss Alps. He intends to stay for three weeks but remains there for seven years. The Europe he knows disappears as he does, resulting in Hans’ return to an altogether different world. Aside from a brief detour to Hans’ childhood, the narration proceeds linearly, from his arrival to the “thunderbolt” that forces his departure.
How Mann proceeds, though, should intrigue quarantined readers. Take, for instance, the book’s seven chapters. They don’t correspond to years, as the first three chapters constitute only a few days. Their distribution is laughably uneven; chapter four is well underway by page 100. Mann’s reasoning is simple: Hans intended to make a quick trip, but he soon discovers he is unwell and becomes a patient himself. He laughs at his cousin’s warnings — “‘You wouldn’t believe how fast and loose they play with people’s time around here.’” — but becomes susceptible to the same disorientation the other patients experience. Time, which used to move quickly and uniformly, has become an unreliable barometer of development (“‘How long or short [time] moves in actuality, no one knows’”). Hans’ struggles with time could not be more relatable in today’s climate.
Why the story — which its narrator describes as a “time-novel” — is obsessed with the subject becomes painfully clear with more context. “The Magic Mountain” depicted a bygone era even to readers of its first edition in 1924. “[The story] does not actually owe its pastness to time,” Mann writes in the foreword; instead, it is war that has fundamentally severed the Berghof sanatorium from the audience’s lives.
There was a demand for escapism among Mann’s contemporaries, for works of art that ignored the ugly reality of life in a defeated power. However, Mann cannot divorce his prewar narrative from the death and destruction that immediately follow. It haunts “The Magic Mountain” and everyone involved, constructing a dramatic irony that the world these characters know will be forever changed. Joachim yearns to be a soldier for his homeland, but the reader knows he is doomed should he leave the mountain. One character, a Romantic idealist, yearns for a new world order as he downplays developments in the Balkans. The mountain is magical because it insulates Hans from what happens below until the entire continent falls into a hellish apocalypse. One could even say it quarantines him.
The mountain does more than just protect Hans from geopolitical machinations. It obscures his own mortality. Death constantly surrounds residents of the Berghof, but much like Mann’s contemporaries, they prefer to hide from painful thoughts, refusing to mention sickness in social interactions. Even in a glorified hospital, suffering can be reduced to a statistic. Hans has to actively expose himself to it in the “Danse Macabre” section to fully gauge the misery around him. That realization is only temporary, though, as Hans falls deeper into the mountain’s trance. It takes a near-death experience in the beautifully written “Snow” section for him to recognize his limitations and acknowledge the frailty of his own life. It is a self-contained adventure and dream sequence — one that reads well on its own if the novel’s size proves too formidable — that packs in enough metaphor and symbolism to fill multiple books. Indeed, Mann noted later in life that “The Magic Mountain” contains so much that it should be read twice.
Once, however, should be enough for readers to come away with a quarantine read that directly and surprisingly addresses the uncertainty of recent times. Mann leaves more to be unpacked — the ever-present sexual tension, debauchery in the face of danger, horrific insights into prewar medicine — but no theme hits harder today than time. Especially in isolation, its movement can be inconstant and volatile. Much like Susanna Clarke’s “Piranesi,” it feels validating to read about an isolated character, divorced from reality, who is subject to events outside their control.
“The Magic Mountain” works right now because it recognizes that time is what we make of it. It’s easy to come out of the book a pessimist. Hans wastes his time, never quick enough to find love. That is a dark ending, but Mann never advocates giving up. Exactly what he advocates for is hard to decipher. His writing is elusive, and the book rarely provides easy answers. Tellingly, though, Mann leaves his readers with a question, the answer to which should inspire confidence even in the darkest of times: “Will love someday rise up out of this, too?”
Today and tomorrow — amidst death and disease — we must hope it will.

Magicians are known for their uncanny ability to trick the mind, pulling off elaborate illusions whose mechanics remain an enticing mystery to the audience. They are decidedly not well known, however, for eliciting tears from their spectators or leaving them with deep existential questions about the nature of truth. And yet Derek DelGaudio, the storytelling mastermind behind the off-Broadway production “In & Of Itself,” now streaming on Hulu, managed to pull off all of the above.
In a performance that is part magic show, part confessional monologue, and part interactive theater, DelGaudio manages to cast an addictive spell on all audience members, both in-person and virtual. The sheer force of his stage presence, equally charismatic and vulnerable, takes the often disparate and ambiguous elements of the show and transforms them into a surreal, hypnotic, and ultimately satisfying quest into the query: “Who am I?”
After running from May 2016 to August 2018 onstage in New York City, “Derek DelGaudio’s In & Of Itself” has reemerged in streaming form. Frank Oz, the director of the original stage production, returned to create the film version on Hulu, featuring recordings directly from the original performances as well as home video footage from DelGaudio’s childhood and compelling animations to accompany his lengthy storytelling. A beloved entertainer himself, known for his puppeteering on “The Muppets,” Oz told Rolling Stone that both he and DelGaudio “like to break things, to break form.” That certainly holds true for “In & Of Itself,” a show that seems to defy standard classifications. Delving into deeply personal anecdotes from his life, each represented by an alcove on the wall behind him, DelGaudio transcends the wow factor of a traditional magic show and infuses the production with daunting philosophical questions. The visual stunts still elicit gasps and quicken pulses, but these magic tricks serve a higher purpose of establishing authentic emotional connections with the audience and encouraging genuine introspection.
DelGaudio demonstrates his extreme prowess as an illusionist early on in the show, performing a relentless stream of card tricks with a nimbleness that is exhilarating to behold. As he recounts his lifelong passion for prestidigitation, there seems to be no feat he can’t pull off with that handy deck of cards — no shuffle he can’t complete seamlessly, no specific suit and number he can’t magically summon from the pile, no sleight-of-hand scheme he can’t pull off on a casino table.
Even more impressive and more difficult to decipher, though, is the emotional magic DelGaudio seems to enact on his captive audience members as they become increasingly active participants in the performance. It is the type of spellbinding effect generated only through intimate storytelling and artistic originality, a magic trick that even Val Valentino, the infamous “Masked Magician,” could never successfully explain to his TV fan base. Each night, as the audience begins to file into the theater, they are asked to choose from an array of 690 cards mounted on the wall, each with the phrase “I am” followed by some one-word label, whether funny (“I am the life of the party”), professional (“I am a teacher”), or deeply serious (“I am an accident”). That decision is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to audience participation, the secret ingredient that makes “In & Of Itself” so fascinating and unique in the world of magic and one-man plays.
While original viewers of the NYC staging only saw one version of the play, Oz has given his Hulu audience compilations of volunteers from many different nights, showcasing the infinite variations these interactive moments can generate. DelGaudio’s direct exchanges with the audience remain a source of joy, grief, and creativity throughout the performance, but it would be a shame to list them all out here and ruin the surprise: better to keep it a mystery for those who have yet to experience the astonishing show for themselves.
There is no doubt that, for the most part, Oz allows DelGaudio’s original masterpiece to shine through, recognizing that less is more when it comes to editing such a mind-melting show. That said, in an era where such intimate, live theater cannot exist safely, this recording of “In & Of Itself” is bound to strike any avid theatergoer as a painful reminder of all that has been lost in the performing arts since March 2020.
Nowhere is that bittersweetness more apparent than during the grand finale, when DelGaudio, now seemingly omniscient, turns to each individual audience member and announces out loud exactly which “I am” card they selected at the start of the show, causing many to instantly burst into tears. Despite the visible emotion, it is apparent that the electricity generated in that small, dark theater by a crowd of mesmerized people is nearly impossible to translate to a computer screen, as the choppy cinematography kills some of the scene’s momentum.
Trying to describe the ultimate meaning of the show is quite futile, a fact made even more evident by the frustratingly vague Hulu synopsis: “It tells the story of a man fighting to see through the illusion of his own identity, only to discover that identity itself is an illusion.” Perhaps one of the work’s greatest achievements, then, is its ability to interrogate the broad, easily clichéd theme of identity while never inducing eye rolls. Beyond forcing viewers to confront the simplistic labels society assigns them, the show serves as a powerful reminder that each individual you pass on the street has an inner world as complex as your own with struggles just as exhausting, an especially important message at a time when it is all too easy to feel completely isolated and alone.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Texas, there are over 900 high schools with law enforcement education and recruitment programs. One of those schools, Horizon High School, is 10 miles from the Mexico-United States border border in El Paso, Texas — the largest city on the border and the city with the highest immigration rates in the country. At the school, which is the setting of Maisie Crow’s latest documentary, students have the ability to pursue law enforcement in both a class and a school-sanctioned club. The class focuses on policing, handcuffs, use of force, and “paramilitary training,” while the club takes students to compete against other schools in realistic reenactments of drug raids, active shooter situations, and hostage recovery.
“At The Ready,” the latest project from documentary filmmaker and photojournalist Crow, follows students in the program as they prepare to compete in the spring’s “Border Challenge Competition” as a way of securing jobs in law enforcement fresh out of high school. Coming off the tails of Crow’s Emmy-Award-winning documentaries like “Jackson” and “Half-lives: The Chernobyl Workers Now,” “At The Ready” presents an intimate look at the institutions which enable policing and the young people brought into that self-aggrandizing culture. The film is both powerful and urgent, illuminating the inner workings of a system often overlooked.
The film focuses on the intersecting stories of Cristina Martinez, a recent graduate of Horizon High School pursuing her “dream career” of becoming a border patrol officer; Cesar Avila, a high school senior looking to become a customs officer; and Mason Garcia, another high school senior hoping to join a S.W.A.T. team. Mason came out as transgender after the documentary was shot and is referred to as “Kassy” in the film. All Mexican American students, the three subjects of the film, face many complications inherent in their chosen path as their choices clash with the values and people they hold dearest.
Ever the journalist, Crow’s interviewing brings out complex common threads in all their stories, which she uses to weave a compelling narrative on the ways class, family, and Latinx immigrant identity inform or present challenges to the students’ goals of joining law enforcement. Her directorial input is evident in how she interacts with her subjects both with the camera and with her interviews, but the story at the end of the day is one which feels true to its subjects.
Notably, Crow also provides a seldom-seen look at why law enforcement agencies in the United States are often largely made up of low-income people and people of color, even though these are the same demographics disproportionately targeted by and represented in the American criminal justice system. For Mason, Cristina, and Cesar, the income attached to the job is one of the primary drivers. In one scene, Cristina’s father tells her that he only recently started making the amount she would make as a border patrol officer, even after years working as a driver. “It’s good money,” he tells her.
"At The Ready" demonstrates how the U.S. police system has long used income, job security, and opportunities for economic mobility to recruit young people of color from low-income communities. The teachers of Horizon’s law enforcement recruitment program, retired police officers themselves, use their positions in authority to forward problematic rhetoric about policing throughout the film, and in the case of one teacher, pushing violent rhetoric and thought processes. “If he has his gun pointed at you, you’re gonna light him up,” he said during one of the drug raid simulations, before adding “we’re here to save the drugs.”
In showing the ways in which students are presented to the violent, toxic ways that police officers often treat the outside world, Crow doesn’t make judgement. Instead, her straightforward, journalistic approach to the film gives viewers the space to make their own judgements on the validity of these police education programs.
Despite the often polarizing subject matter of policing and police recruitment — especially when it is Latinx students being recruited to work for border patrol — “At The Ready'' doesn't shame the students nor blame their teachers for the system they work under. Instead, the documentary does what all good documentaries should: It tells a story as authentically as possible. Because of that, “At The Ready'' came at exactly the right time. As increased scrutiny is leveraged against the police force and those working in it, “At The Ready'' provides a much-needed exploration of the ways in which American institutions perpetuate their systems of control.

On Jan. 20, former President Donald Trump granted clemency to 143 people, including prominent rappers Kodak Black and Lil Wayne. Both had been charged with federal weapons offenses and sentenced to four and ten years respectively. The reasons for their sudden pardoning remain under question. Soon after Trump’s list went public, social media was up in arms, split in a debate over whether the pardons were justified or not. Although the decision to pardon the rappers may seem odd, the resulting controversy quickly became part of a much more serious cultural debate.
It was first revealed that former President Trump was planning to pardon the celebrities almost two weeks before he actually did. It didn’t reach mainstream media at first, seeing as people were too busy speculating about the possibility of Trump pardoning himself. Once the word about Wayne and Kodak got through the fray, the public quickly voiced their mixed reactions.
Some thought it was about time, deeming Kodak’s sentencing too harsh for a paper crime. Others disagreed, arguing that the rapper’s open charges — including rape allegations from 2016 — were reason enough to get him locked up for life.
Fellow rappers were quick to put their two cents in after they caught wind of a pardon on the horizon. Lil Yachty, for example, got the hashtag #freekodak trending. Kodak himself jumped on the bandwagon, tweeting out that he would donate $1 million to charity if the president freed him.
Looking beyond the public debate, one realizes that the reasons behind the rappers’ pardons, however contested they may be, are very dubious.
It is no secret that Lil Wayne is a Trump supporter. The rapper has been very transparent with his endorsement of the administration, often tweeting about the former president’s reform efforts during his election campaigns in 2020. What is not well-known is that, according to the rapper’s lawyer Bradford Cohen, Wayne’s pardon is claimed to be all thanks to "President Trump and his administration” who he claimed “have been tireless advocates on behalf of the African-American community.” When suspicions arose about Wayne having supported Trump precisely because of the power of his presidential pardon, Cohen denied them.
Clearly, something more was going on behind the Twitter screens and the litigious jargon.
In an unsurprising sequence of events, Cohen also spoke on behalf of Kodak Black, saying Kodak “has always given charity his whole career and will continue to do charity, not in exchange for anything,” closely aligning with the White House’s statement on his pardon being due to his philanthropic work on a "variety of charitable efforts, such as providing educational resources to students and families of fallen law enforcement officers and the underprivileged."
Given such questionable reasoning for the rappers’ pardons, people dismissed them, writing them off as a result of the rappers’ endorsement of Trump. With personal political affiliations likely being a factor, the entitlement we feel to passionately contest such issues cannot be overlooked.
The problem is that no one really cares about the systemic oppression at the heart of this issue when there are more trendy issues to debate about. Why talk about institutionalized racism when the Trump pardon list is trending? Why ask how long Wayne was sentenced to prison for when you can write him off as a Trump supporter? Why talk about how one in four Black men end up in the criminal justice system when you can argue about whether four to ten years is a long enough prison sentence?
It is incredibly concerning that we as a society have grown so apathetic to mass incarceration that only top-tier artists can spur a discussion about the imprisonment of Black men. The very hypocrisy of us going out of our way to pick and choose to pardon the victims we deem fit — while simultaneously refusing to condemn the institutions that benefit from their imprisonment in the first place — is disappointing.
Only in a country like America can the people who tweet #freekodak be the very same people who post under #MakeAmericaGreatAgain.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I found the Bernie meme (™) very innocuously: Instead of writing my senior thesis, I was scrolling through Twitter. This discovery happened very early in the meme saga — what one might call the before times. The memes had not yet been made: All I saw was Bernie Sanders sitting in a hunched-over, pensive position (he really might be “The Thinker” of our century), right leg crossed over the left, brown knitted mittens matching his shoes (worn at the soles, of course) and contrasting enough to chromatically fit with his jacket. This jacket seems to appear in another Bernie meme, the one in which he is “once again asking.” There were some tweets contrasting Bernie Sanders and Janet Yellen, who had also dressed for the weather, but — of course — it was Bernie who stole the show. Soon another photo of him with a manila folder suggesting a lengthy to-do list appeared, sealing the deal. That photo did not get meme-ified, but it did provoke laughs, commentary, and burning ardor for the Vermont senator.
Today, the subject at hand is not universal health care, but rather Bernie and his uncanny ability to become a meme in addition to unpacking why this phenomenon exists in the first place. In the two formats already mentioned, his posture is iconic and easily manipulable, as is the text accompanying the first one. “I am once again asking for your financial support” can be co-opted by college students bemoaning the existence of Zoom breakout rooms (they’re awful), people asking for love, or literally anyone thinking about the dumpster fire that was 2020.
But Bernie in the chair at the inauguration blew any past memes out of the water, spawning endless tweets that have slowed to a trickle, but, crucially, have not stopped. The posture, the jacket, the mask slightly askew — we’re visual creatures, and it’s impossible to not feel how he feels while sitting there in the cold at a distance from everyone else in Washington, D.C.
Of course, if any other political figure had made this pose, the resulting image would not have become a meme. Bernie’s status as a politician, figurehead, and icon is key; for millions of people, he is a champion of human rights in a country that all too often denies people dignity, financial recourse, and the much-vaunted “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” Bernie wants to finance direct payments to alleviate the crisis stemming from Covid-19 — and wants to do it now. He has donated the funds from the merchandise branded with this very meme to Vermont charities, and is pushing to raise the federal minimum wage. All this comes in addition to his years-long fight for universal health care — a fight made even more urgent by the ongoing public health crisis (I’m sure you’ve heard of it?).
Many people feel that Bernie sees them and their struggles, and, moreover, does things in the senate to alleviate their suffering. The ardor for Bernie is real — it is not a stretch to say that these memes were made in some kind of homage to him and his genuinely-felt efforts to help the American people.
There are many ways to celebrate cultural figures, but in the internet age, memes reign supreme. Why? They combine the visual with the textual, if text is even needed, to convey an emotion that immediately feels universal to many or is otherwise relatable. They’re comic relief, though many are dark. Yet they instantly and clearly communicate what animates and preoccupies us, poking fun at or elevating the subject. Bernie fits into this online culture because of his tirelessness, his honesty, and his passion for the causes that matter to him. These causes, should they come to pass, would help millions — and the people watching him and participating in the creation and amplification of memes know this. Politics aside, however, Bernie — especially in the latest inauguration meme — is relatable, and the endless spinoffs only augment the relatability of his posture. Sitting in a chair, hunched over: The effect is priceless. I myself have bookmarked many iterations on Twitter. It’s important to keep records.

From Lady Gaga’s defiant national anthem rendition to John Legend’s stirring cover of Nina Simone’s “Feeling Good” to Jennifer Lopez’s mid-song Pledge of Allegiance in Spanish, President Joe Biden’s inauguration day was packed with powerhouse musical moments. The first two verses of Garth Brooks’s “Amazing Grace” were not one of them, but it doesn’t matter.
It doesn’t matter that Brooks offered musical phrases shorter than the life expectancy of a Trump appointee. It doesn’t matter that he forgot to hold a pitch altogether on the crucial lyric “God’s praise,” perhaps because he was distracted by hat-based choreography. It doesn’t matter that his (shall we say bold) choice to perform a cappella turned the microphone into a microscope, enlarging each of these mistakes by several orders of magnitude.
It doesn’t matter, because just before the hymn’s final verse, Brooks told us to sing along. “Not just the people here, but the people at home, at work, as one, united.” And so we did. Traumatized by Trump, rattled by rioters, and silenced by social distancing, we raised our voices in nationwide song — and in doing so, we took the first step toward healing.
Although it was penned by an Anglican minister, John Newton, “Amazing Grace” has become intimately tied to American social and spiritual identity. Newton penned the hymn after his miraculous survival of a shipwreck spurred his conversion to Christianity. This religious shift eventually led a belatedly introspective Newton, himself a former enslaver, to publish “Thoughts Upon the Slave Trade.” As a result, the half-truth of Newton’s role as a symbol of egalitarianism — a white savior of the same Black people to whose torture and death he actively contributed — entered the Anglophone cultural consciousness. Newton’s “Thoughts” (enslaving people is bad, basically) proved controversial but popular. They made their way into the hands of every member of the British Parliament, aiding the relative success of his country’s abolitionist movement decades before Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
For over two centuries, Americans have returned to “Amazing Grace” when the country feels blind and lost. The hymn is performed about 10 million times per year, and in times of ethical and political crisis, such as the Civil and the Vietnam Wars, its popularity gets a boost.
In 2015, after white supremacist Dylann Roof shot and killed nine Black parishioners of the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, Barack Obama included the hymn in his eulogy for Rev. Clementa Pinckney, a defining moment of his presidency. That performance, in turn, inspired Zoe Mulford to write “The President Sang Amazing Grace,” earning covers by the likes of Joan Baez and coverage in The New York Times just before the 2020 presidential election.
“I think if I sing, the church will sing with me,” Obama reportedly said to adviser Valerie Jarrett before the eulogy. He was right. To quote Mulford’s lyrics, “No words could say what must be said,” so the congregation sang. Although the interpretation was far from pitch-perfect, mourners latched onto a former enslaver’s song as a message of hope, a reason to believe in the possibility of change, and they joined in the project of proclaiming it.
But in the face of our most recent national shame, the January 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol at the behest of a sitting president, “Amazing Grace” could offer no immediate remedy. The coronavirus makes group singing irresponsible at best and fatal at worst. After a Washington choir rehearsal gained notoriety for becoming one of the first superspreader events and left two singers dead, researchers found that singing generates a greater number of respiratory aerosols than speech, making it one of the most dangerous pandemic-era activities. For now, the healing powers of singing together are outweighed by the potential costs. We watch white supremacists take the Senate floor on television. We mourn our dead behind closed doors.
Enter Garth Brooks. Enter a moment of unique generosity and insight. Enter the opportunity for Americans from coast to coast to breathe as one people in the middle of a pandemic. After all, if grace can save a wretch like John Newton, maybe it can still save a wretch like the United States.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After two years of singles and EPs, British singer and poet Arlo Parks released her debut album “Collapsed in Sunbeams” on Jan. 29. Swingy and thoughtful, the album synthesizes many of Parks’ strengths — easy melodies that stick in your head, tight lyrics that unravel with each listen. While few of the album’s new tracks quite compare to Parks’ biggest singles like “Black Dog” or “Eugene,” “Collapsed in Sunbeams” weaves these earlier releases together with relaxed, refreshing, and occasionally brilliant additions.
The first song on “Collapsed in Sunbeams,” “Hurt” is, like much of the album’s first half, a pre-released single. According to an interview with Parks, “Hurt” is ostensibly about triumph, though its moody mantra, “just know it won’t hurt so / won’t hurt so much forever,” feels almost hollow as it echoes over a hummed melody and subtle drums. When introduced by the album’s titular poem, however, the intentionality becomes clearer; Parks’ goal, it seems, is to show that hurt and hope cannot be unentangled. “Collapsed in sunbeams, stretched out open to beauty however brief or violent,” she reads, before introducing a series of images of two people “ablaze with joy,” “elbows touching,” “hurt and terribly quiet.” The integration of that duality — the pain of love, particularly love as a Black, queer woman, with hope and fiery intimacy — is what elevates Parks’ often pain-ridden songs into something violently alive.
Parks’ ability to capture both the heights and depths of love with such painstaking precision is a testament to her poetry and song-writing skills. She has a particular knack for gutting openers, like the line “I’d lick the grief right off your lips” from the eerie “Black Dog.” Though “Black Dog” has already received critical acclaim since its release in May, it bears repeating that what NME called “the year’s most devastating song” doesn’t lose its bitter beauty over time. And thankfully, Parks proves she can still kill an opener on several brand-new songs on the album, notably the late addition “Bluish.” A whispery, claustrophobic song about abuse, she introduces it with the accusation: “[you] smothered me with fake blood and ginger.” Parks thrives on dissonance and particularity, juxtaposing tiny details that both clash and coalesce in vivid, just-right detail.
The sonic backdrop to Parks’ stunning lyrics doesn’t always live up to the words themselves, though there are moments of true creativity that peak out from the looping drums and laid-back vocals. While songs like “Hope” and “Caroline” border on repetitive, fresh entries like “Just Go” break things up with a dash of upbeat, jazzy bitterness. “Bluish” is a standout here, too, where Parks’ faraway vocals and syncopated electronic pulses make the perfect backdrop to the chilling chorus “You held me so hard I went bluish.”
Woven throughout Parks’ thesis on the interconnectedness of love’s joys and triumphs, “Collapsed in Sunbeams” also contains an implicit message about queer love as well. Artists and art critics often debate what “positive” representation looks like when it comes to relationships between queer and queer BIPOC people especially; there’s little representation in the first place, and even fewer depictions of love that doesn’t end in tragedy. To compensate for that deficiency, though, there’s the opposite danger of “forcing” relationships to work out, in art and in life, or holding queer couples to an impossible standard of optimism. In navigating the complexities of writing about queer love, Parks seems to straddle this dichotomy particularly well; she doesn’t gloss over the challenges of dealing with homophobic parents or unrequited love, but she holds out hope to her listeners, too. Parks has the kind of relationship with her identity that’s infectious, mature, nonchalant, and freeing. She’s not sweating over whether the world approves of her love; rather, she’s created songs that move beyond a surface-level “it’s ok to be queer” and get into all the real, complex, salty messiness of dating as a queer person. “Green Eyes” is a perfect example of this: It’s a song with empathy for a partner who still feels shame when she “hold[s] [her] hand in public,” but also a declaration that Parks knows she deserves better. That self-possessed nonchalance is also part of the charm of “Eugene”; Parks certainly doesn't sing about shame or guilt when she talks about falling for a close friend. Rather, she gives herself permission to hope, to be angry, and to throw some well-deserved shade at her friend's boyfriend.
All in all, “Collapsed in Sunbeams” is not a perfect album. It’s sometimes repetitive, occasionally a bit cliché, and not every intro quite lives up to the one in “Black Dog.” (The well-intentioned opening like in album closer “Portra 400” “making rainbows out of something painful,” for example, feels moralistic and almost cheesy.) But every once in a while, a combination of Parks' smooth, driving rhythms and spare, just-right adjectives strikes gold.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sion Sono, often regarded as Japanese cinema’s most subversive filmmaker, has made 57 films in a colorful, three decades-long career. On Jan. 31, he premiered his first and only English language feature at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival — the very festival he always dreamed of premiering his first English film in. In “Prisoners of the Ghostland,” the prolific director joined one of the U.S.’s most prolific actors, Nicolas Cage, to create a wild but compelling mash-up of Eastern and Western cinematic influences, with cinematography so beautiful it could justify the film's often unhinged plot.
The film follows Cage as a bank robber sprung from jail by a wealthy warlord known only as “The Governor” (Bill Moseley), who offers freedom in exchange for finding his missing granddaughter Bernice (Sofia Boutella). Strapped into a leather suit that will self-destruct within five days, the prisoner-turned-hero sets off on a journey to find Bernice and his freedom.
“Prisoners of the Ghostland” is a thematic rollercoaster from start to finish, so much so that the two bombs strapped to the hero’s privates as part of his self-destruct suit aren’t even the most shocking thing to happen in the first 15 minutes. A mash-up of Western cowboy and samurai films, “Prisoners of the Ghostland” is as ballsy as it is outlandish, featuring ghosts, samurais, ninjas, and a nuclear apocalypse as just some of its key plot points.
In a film containing countless fantastical references, the aesthetics crafted by Sono and his crew create a beautiful tapestry of surrealism that evokes the traditional iconography of both Eastern and Western cinema. The aptly named Samurai Town, for example, where The Governor and his subjects live, is painted in rich reds and blues and adorned with lanterns whose yellow light washes the set in a warm glow. The everpresent snow falling lightly in all of the town’s scenes gives the impression of a Japanese woodblock print come to life.
Because of its roots in two arguably “macho” film genres, however, “Prisoners of the Ghostland” is unfortunately so steeped in hypermasculinity that its protagonist is too campy to be taken seriously. Complete with a hefty criminal record, deep raspy voice, and a devil-may-care attitude, Cage’s performance is made up solely out of grunts, threats, and an expletive every other word. In his role as the “hero” to the poor damsel in distress, the hero’s outward masculinity is taken to a fever pitch, as he becomes the only one purportedly capable of saving Bernice and the people around her. The few opportunities the hero has to be sincere and introspective fall flat, feeling unnatural and forced for a character who throughout the film shows virtually no emotion or attachment.
Before Sono was a filmmaker, he was a poet, and that background is still evident in “Prisoners of the Ghostland” — even amidst all its absurdity. In between ninja duels and bank robberies, the film is also built on deeper themes of time and exploitation.
The oppression of time, nuclear disaster, and colonialism are all woven into the film and its characters, made evident by Sono’s subtle use of recurring images and motifs. One example is a clock in Ghostland, the industrial wasteland where much of the movie takes place, which is not allowed to strike past 8:14. Though it’s never explicitly mentioned, the decision for that time is intentional. Ghostland was destroyed by a nuclear disaster, and 8:15 was the time that the atomic bomb struck Hiroshima in 1945. The citizens of Ghostland are enslaved by that clock, and Sono’s decision to include it adds a whole other dimension to the East-meets-Western.
While teaching a masterclass at the 3rd International Film Festival and Awards Macao prior to the film’s release, Cage called “Prisoners of the Ghostland” “the wildest movie I've ever made, and that's saying something." Indeed, the film is wild. Though intense, absurd, and crammed with fantastical plot elements, it’s also a stunning film to watch. The aesthetics are stellar, steeped in rich color and perfectly set to the events and mood of each scene, all together creating a film that — while unhinged at times — is a compelling argument for more Sono-led innovations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Divestment and preferred pronouns were foreign concepts to me until my first week at Harvard. For many other Harvard students, these ideas are commonplace topics, but in parts of rural America like my hometown, they threaten a way of life.
In my experience, any concept that could change the status quo is essentially forbidden in rural areas. Most talk of climate change is silenced because it poses a threat to rural economies dependent on oil and natural gas. Homosexuality is not openly discussed because it “contradicts” the traditional family structure. These and other ideas widely discussed on the internet and social media could shatter the rural way of life — so we don’t talk about them. A lack of awareness remains pervasive because of the regimented lifestyle of rural youth.
Regardless of location, school takes up a large part of students’ free time. School culture can either encourage or obstruct students’ awareness of social issues. In urban or suburban areas, it seems that schools often feed into social awareness; students can share different opinions about recent events, form groups or clubs that take on social issues, and, possibly, mobilize.
At my high school, on the other hand, the discussion of social issues and diversity of thought was limited. For example, country music was generally the only music genre teachers played in class. Country music totes a racist past, its themes tend to glorify the Old South or Old West, and the lyrics often affirm traditional gender roles and the objectification of women. More glaringly, many rural, majority-white schools, including my own, fail to tackle difficult topics like racial injustice in the classroom. Throughout my high school experience, pertinent problems like the racial wage gap and incarceration were never connected to relevant classroom curriculum.
Of course, rural youth are not always in school, but in my hometown, time outside of school is still largely dictated by a routine that limits exposure to new ideas — Friday night is for football, Saturday is spent attending other school events, and Sunday is a day for church.
This routine lacks free spaces for students to openly discuss taboo topics without being monitored by authority figures. While tradition and routine may foster a tight-knit community, they make it very difficult to interact with people of diverse backgrounds, further isolating rural youth from exposure to new ideas.
Graduating from high school can alter some aspects of the routine. I was lucky enough to be admitted to Harvard and begin my own social education. Here I have been exposed to a variety of people from different backgrounds. Divestment, preferred pronouns, and other previously unheard of concepts are now a part of my vocabulary. Besides offering social exposure through my peers, Harvard has also provided me the opportunity to take classes that inspire empathy, understanding, and awareness.
Some rural youth are not so privileged. Youth from rural areas are less likely to pursue higher education compared to their urban counterparts. Rural areas tend to see more people stick around than urban areas. Those who stay start a family that eventually follows the same regimen as the generation before. It is through this cycle that archaic traditions and ideas find renewed life, staving off social modernization or mobilization.
To the communities that cycle through the pattern I described, there does not seem to be a reason to upset a routine that has served generations of majority groups well. The flipside that these communities either do not see or do not wish to address, is that the side effects of adherence to such a prescribed lifestyle can harm rural people of color or rural members of the BGLTQ identifying community.
The events of the last few years have made it nearly impossible to ignore the fact that change is absolutely necessary in America, but for these changes to gain momentum and eventually come to fruition, rural support is crucial. Rural communities must realize that a comfortable routine is not satisfactory when fellow Americans are routinely experiencing disadvantage and discrimination.
And while routine and adherence to tradition might be more apparent in rural communities, we all develop and stick to a routine that, if we are not careful, can blind us.
We get used to studying with the same problem set buddies, hanging out in the same circle of friends, eating at the same restaurants, lamenting the same social ills without action, and awkward half-smiling at the same security guards. These habits may provide us comfort, but we accept them at a cost. We don’t meet new people, we don’t support other businesses, we don't dig deeper to find ways to improve ourselves or the community, and we become contently complicit in the bubble we have created. The confines of this routine can render some Harvard students unaware of life outside the Harvard bubble.
To my fellow students, it may be tempting to settle into a pattern that is satisfactory to you, but do not blindly accept it. You may find the status quo acceptable, but it also may be inadequate, unfair, or oppressive for others. Despite the social distance Harvard may seem to have from rural communities, we too may fall victim to the dangers of routine. Continue to challenge your ideas and the ideas of those around you. Introduce yourself to a person you have never met. Find new ways to support vulnerable members of your community. Ultimately, learn to embrace routine change rather than routine.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the past several months, the College Board has itself been put to the test. The pandemic-ridden world – marked by heightened student anxieties, aggravated inequities, and the eruption of online schooling – has shaken the foundations of standardized testing and college admissions.
The initial changes were pronounced yet provisional: In the fall, the College Board faced test sites closures across the country, sending away hundreds of thousands of students registered for the SAT exam. Against this backdrop, colleges across the country have chosen to go test-blind for the second year in a row.
Many predicted that the pandemic would force the College Board to invoke more permanent change – to engage in careful reconsideration of its procedures and principles for the long term. Finally, in deciding to scrap the SAT with essay and the SAT Subject Tests, it has begun to do just that.
Through this decision, the College Board has at last begun to pivot away from perpetuating a set of tedious, arbitrary requirements that have historically impeded students’ ability to go to college.
As we have opined before, the rubric of the SAT essay is unnecessarily unclear, subjective, and obscure; it seems to punish creativity and abstract thinking. Beyond that, the purported purpose of testing is at its core to encourage students to learn from their mistakes, but the score reports from the SAT essay include virtually no substantial feedback. What value lies in granting a 17-year-old student an inexplicably low score for an essay that, while potentially well-written and poised, fails to meet the standards of a paradoxically vague yet hyper-specific grading rubric? Such limitations aren’t just reductive – they’re inherently antithetical to all that a holistic and dynamic education is supposed to embody.
The SAT Subject Tests, too, place undue stress upon already overburdened high school students. In testing the minute specifics of broad subjects, the SAT Subject Tests prioritize memorization rather than reason, often allowing obscure, limited facts to eclipse spirited academic explorations. In practice, they add to the long list of exams that students must take in their second half of high school with, to our minds, little to no apparent pedagogical benefit: For many of the offered subjects, the College Board offers a standardized curriculum in the form of Advanced Placement — but then tests it separately.
Before the College Board made this decision, colleges often presented a laundry list of testing requirements, creating impossible roadblocks for many students – especially those already most vulnerable to unfair admissions processes. Some schools, for instance, recently required three SAT Subject Tests despite the fact that preparing for and taking these tests can often place a financial burden upon families. Such requirements, then, unreservedly preclude a considerable number of students from simply applying to certain colleges. The new decision will make it slightly more difficult for colleges to set up such arbitrary barriers and unfair, vexing obstructions.
Both the essay and the Subject Tests invoked simmering pressure and seething stress, and they loaded students with an additional financial burden that their families oftentimes struggled to carry; clearly, these tests won’t be missed. Still, the college application process remains remarkably tainted, and much work remains if the College Board is to truly help make college admissions more inclusive, accessible, and reasonable.
The eradication of the SAT Subject Tests will undoubtedly make the imperfect AP program much more high stakes and amplify its flaws. AP exams restrict and place pressure upon students who cannot take them, either because their school doesn’t offer these advanced classes, or because they cannot afford to pay the hefty $95 standard fee and may be ill-positioned to obtain a fee waiver.
Moving forward, the College Board must also think deliberately and responsibly about its treatment of international students. With the removal of the SAT essay and Subject Tests, international students have been stripped of one of the few metrics through which they could be plainly compared to American students. If the College Board insists on retaining AP tests, they should ensure their availability for international students who often don’t have access to AP curriculums or exams within their high schools and increase their accessibility for those who cannot afford the even higher testing fee of $135 for students outside of the United States and Canada.
The College Board’s choice to slay the SAT essay and Subject Test is a step in the right direction — a step towards making college admissions slightly more equitable, accessible, and oriented towards diversity. Let us hope, though, that this small step will commence a much broader series of changes in college admissions — changes such as reconsidering the role of AP tests, finding ways to make the application process more accessible for international students, and eliminating any and all roadblocks that would preclude any student from applying to college.
The College Board may have passed its first test, but reforming standardized testing and college admissions is a long and challenging course.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Feb. 2, 2021 at 1:50 p.m.
Harvard began allowing eligible undergraduates living on campus to access research labs Saturday, with plans to extend the eligibility to enrolled students living off campus as early as Feb. 15.
According to the policy crafted by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the College, enrolled undergraduate students living on campus are permitted to participate in mentored lab research this semester. The new policy — which applies to all FAS divisions — marks a departure from the more stringent measures put in place last fall, when research was limited to on-campus seniors working on their theses, according to Director of Science Education Logan S. McCarty ’96.
To start the process of granting lab access this semester, faculty mentors must confirm they are willing to sponsor the student, as well as ensure their lab upholds Covid-19 safety guidelines, such as having proper social distancing measures and sufficient ventilation.
Permission being granted is “contingent” on the student’s ability to follow the College's “community compact” — a set of social distancing and pandemic safety guidelines — and Covid-19 testing regimens; failure to comply can result in revocation of lab access, according to the policy. Access is also subject to change and dependent on the public health situation.
On-campus students must have received their third negative Covid-19 test after arrival, meaning the earliest point at which they would be able to return to the lab was Saturday.
“We felt it was really important to get undergraduate researchers back into the labs, as long as we could do it safely,” McCarty said. “We see research participation for undergraduate students as being not an optional part of education — that’s a crucial part of undergraduate education and so we wanted to find a way to help make that possible.”
In addition to on-campus students, those enrolled and living off campus in the local area will be able to access the labs on Feb. 15 at the earliest, according to the policy.
“Part of our thinking about the off-campus students was that we’ve had graduate students in our labs since the summer when we first reopened the labs, and the graduate students are living off campus,” McCarty said. “We had months of sort of success with graduate students and postdoctoral researchers working in labs, and we thought that we could safely then include in that population, on a similar basis, essentially, undergraduates who were living off campus.”
Joshua A. Ng ’23, an engineering student who is doing undergraduate research for the first time this semester, said he was excited for the opportunity and confident in the lab’s safety protocols.
“I’m excited to do in-person research because I’ll be actually doing tests in the lab, and I’ll be actually working with the materials for my research,” he said.
“I feel very confident about the Covid guidelines that they have put out — I’m going to work in the Microrobotics Lab, so I’m going to be in the new science and engineering complex in Allston, and I’ve read through the guidelines and it is very specific,” he added.
Ng said he is sympathetic to the fact that there still may be some “kinks” in the policy as the labs open up.
“This is all new, so I think I’m very understanding because this is all new water,” Ng said. “This is the first time that this type of program is being done, so they’re still working out the kinks. And we’re also in a pandemic, so I think flexibility is key during this time.”
Emma V. Stimpfl ’21, who conducted on-campus research last semester toward her thesis in Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology, said she was concerned that increasing the number of people authorized to access labs this semester would reduce the time undergraduates could spend in the lab during normal hours, given that lab capacity restrictions have not changed since the fall semester — resulting in more shifts on weekends, mornings, or evenings when full-time staff are not present.
“I think that’s a big problem, especially for undergrads,” Stimpfl said. “The biggest thing that we’ve been saying as students in our group chats is, 'Wait, how are we supposed to learn from people, or even just get help, especially on the weekends?'”
McCarty wrote in an email that every lab and department will have “somewhat different requirements and schedules,” making it difficult to say whether such scheduling issues would arise.
“Our policy now is to give all students the same opportunities within the constraints dictated by laboratory safety,” he wrote.
Because all instruction will be online for the semester, teaching labs will remain closed to undergraduates, according to the policy. The webpage notes, however, that “some limited on-campus instructional activities” could take place in March or April under a pilot program the FAS first announced in December.
McCarty said any in-person academic experiences would be “very limited” — such as a single week of optional on-campus instruction — and would be aimed at creating a “framework” for the FAS to safely teach classes in person in the fall.
“It would be a really small scale thing — I think they’re talking about literally a handful of courses,” he said. “And anything that’s done here would be an optional activity for students, because obviously there are students who are not living on campus or not nearby.”
CORRECTION: Feb. 2, 2021
Due to an editing error, a previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the research policy was crafted by the FAS Sciences Division and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. In fact, the policy was crafted by the FAS and the College, and applies to students from all divisions.

Alan M. Dershowitz, professor emeritus at Harvard Law School, nominated former White House advisor Jared C. Kushner ’03 and his deputy Avrahm “Avi” Berkowitz for the Nobel Peace Prize on Sunday for their work on the Abraham Accords.
Anyone can be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, though nominators are restricted to professors and directors in the social sciences, former Nobel Peace Prize recipients, and other national and international governments and institutions, such as the International Court of Justice.
In his letter to the Nobel Committee, Dershowitz cited the Abraham Accords as fulfilling “all criteria for the prize.”
The accords mark the first normalization of diplomatic relations between an Arab country and Israel since 1994.
“The Abraham Accords was the single most important peace-oriented event of the year 2020,” Dershowitz said. “There’s no other event in the world that compares to it in importance.”
Dershowitz argued that, though many are familiar with leaders such as former President Donald J. Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and their participation in the agreement, individuals who worked “behind the scenes to get it done” deserved commendation.
“Kushner and Berkowitz traveled all over the region, meeting with leaders and their associates, advocating for peace and nailing down all the details,” he wrote in his letter.
Dershowitz is a long-time, vocal supporter of Israel and is a close ally of former President Donald Trump.
Dershowitz said he is optimistic about the Biden administration’s ability to continue building peace in the region, citing the President’s “very strong peace team,” including Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken ’84, a former Crimson editor.
“The elements are all in place to move forward and to not only have peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors, but perhaps to move closer to some peace between Israel and the Palestinians,” Dershowitz said.
Awarding the prize to individuals who helped establish the Abraham Accords could incentivize other countries to join themselves, Dershowitz said. He also predicted it would “encourage other countries to make peace” and “achieve normalization.”
“The function of the award is as much looking forward as backward,” Dershowitz added. “Giving the award to an ongoing peace process would encourage countries to join that peace process, and would encourage the Biden administration to build on it, which I hope they will do.”
Despite the prize’s renown, Dershowitz said the laureates should not be a reflection of public opinion, citing laureates including Henry Kissinger and Yasser Arafat, who he said were controversial figures at the time.
“I want to emphasize that it’s not a popularity contest,” Dershowitz said. “It’s given for specific actions that help bring about peace.”
Kushner said he was honored to be nominated in a statement.
“In 2020 we brokered peace agreements between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco, the first such agreements in over 25 years,” Kushner said. “Thanks to these agreements the region is on a new trajectory that will improve the lives of millions of Israelis and Arabs.”
Berkowitz thanked former President Trump and Kushner for “having [him] on this team,” and Dershowitz for the nomination.
“I would also like to recognize the many negotiators that Jared and I had the privilege to work with in the Middle East,” Berkowitz said in a statement. “Peace is a beautiful thing.”
First awarded in 1901, the Nobel Peace Prize has since been awarded 100 times to 131 laureates total, according to its official website. Every year, nearly 200 nominees are submitted, according to the Nobel Foundation.
The Nobel Peace Prize will be awarded in October.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard political experts exchanged views about the future of American democracy following a transition of power marked by insurrection at an Institute of Politics event Monday.
The event, titled “The State of Democracy: Where Do We Go From Here?” featured Eaton Professor of Government Daniel Ziblatt, who co-wrote the book “How Democracies Die,” and government department research coordinator Caroline M. Tervo ’18.
The event marked the finale of a four-part series titled the Harvard Political Union Democracy Fortnight, which brought together policy experts, activists, and scholars to offer their prognoses on the state of American democracy.
Amid bipartisan calls for unity, Ziblatt said the United States must confront the Jan. 6 storming of the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob.
“You can’t move forward unless you deal with the past,” he said.
Tervo also said disinformation campaigns on social media are largely responsible for fueling animosity between Democrats and Republicans.
“The extent to which your only messenger is some disinformation campaign on social media — that totally confounds any ability to have that delivery,” she said. “Having build-up in civic networks, build-up in social capital, can combat that.”
The insurrection, Ziblatt said, shed light on other breakdowns in America’s political system.
“Our constitutional system, which has always favored rural areas, for the first time in recent memory, or in a century really, is disproportionately favoring the Republican Party — in the Senate, in the Electoral College, and the Supreme Court,” Ziblatt said. “And so what all this means is that, essentially, the Republican Party can continue to do well, gain office, without winning a majority of the vote.”
Though Republicans have controlled the White House for 12 of the last 20 years, Ziblatt noted the party only won the popular vote in one of those presidential elections.
Still, Ziblatt said the high voter turnout in the 2020 election shows that American democracy is functioning.
“The high voter turnout — despite efforts to disenfranchise people — shows us that our electoral institutions work. The electoral channels remain open,” Ziblatt said. “So no matter what side you’re on, it means that our democracy worked. The fact that we had this trouble around January 6 suggests that it wasn’t seamless.”
As a result, Tervo said the United States’ current election system can have the effect of dissuading people from participating in the political process.
“I think the extent to which we have these structures where civic participation and voter participation — this exercise of rights — is literally not valuable or useful, I think is very degrading to the country and the system,” she said.
Tervo added that the country should refine its election process to make Americans feel their voice matters in politics.
“We could get some good reforms in here that a lot of people would feel really good about that still have elements of preserving minority rights and minority rule,” she said. “So if you’re a Democrat voting in Alabama or a Republican in Maryland, you would know that it’s not a waste of your time to show up to the ballot and vote for president.”

Melanie T. Munoz ’24 said her involvement with Hermanitas — the big sibling-little sibling program run by Latinas Unidas — ultimately influenced her decision to enroll at the College last May.
“I committed because I saw this community of people [at Harvard] that were like me,” Munoz said. “I came from a predominantly white high school, so there was never people like me that I could relate to or share my experience with. It was a big part of my decision to commit.”
Despite being held virtually, Hermanitas helped her forge bonds with other members of Latinas Unidas through nights spent reminiscing on pre-pandemic life and discussing Bad Bunny’s new album, Munoz said.
Munoz is just one of many freshman students who said they found a sense of belonging in their respective cultural groups as they navigated their first semester of college virtually in the fall.
Though invited to live on campus last fall, members of the Class of 2024 had limited social interaction due to most facets of campus life — classes, extracurriculars, socials — being rendered virtual to adhere to the College’s social distancing protocols amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Regardless of the challenges associated with a virtual fall, both freshmen that joined campus cultural groups last fall and the upperclassmen who lead them said the groups continued to create programming to support freshmen in their transition to college life.
Cultural groups have long been a staple of the Harvard extracurricular scene, with more than 50 cultural, ethnic, and international student organizations represented. These groups often serve as a first community for freshmen as they adjust to college life.
Some cultural group leaders said they have tailored their programming this year to recognize and adapt to the unique challenges facing the Class of 2024.
“The freshmen are a unique group in which we are trying to focus our programming around, and something we are still working towards,” said Oluwatoba “Toba” Olokungbemi ’22, president of the Nigerian Students Association.
“We have been working with the two first-year representatives to make sure that all members feel supported and part of the NSA community,” he added.
Aarya A. Kaushik ’24, a first-year representative for the South Asian Association, described joining SAA as both a “grounding” and a “welcoming” experience to the Harvard community.
“I’m just finding other people, other students who come from the same cultural background as me and are willing to showcase that,” Kaushik said. “That’s kind of foreign to me, actually, just based on where I am, where I come from.”
Jasmine N. Adams ’24, a first-year representative for the Association of Black Harvard Women, said cultural organizations have expanded their role in Harvard student life during the pandemic.
“Even before the pandemic, I knew that cultural groups on campus were going to be huge for me,” Adams said. “With Covid, we had to create a safe haven within our club. I feel like a lot of the cultural groups have taken on that role of just being a safe haven, like, ‘Look, we know it’s hard. We’re all struggling.’”
For some of the cultural groups, fostering a virtual community on Zoom has led to challenges, such as difficulties in promoting events and declining attendance at club meetings.
Olokungbemi said it has been “really hard” to replicate the same community his organization had in person.
“The hardest part has definitely been trying to maintain and grow the same community that we have built throughout the years on campus,” Olokungbemi said. “Our organization is very community based, and I think that’s obviously been really hard to do virtually.”
Munoz added that Zoom fatigue also made it harder for some members to commit to attending virtual events.
“Online, it’s very easy to blow it off — if you just never open your computer screen, you’re never held accountable for it,” she said. “You don’t have to face these people the next day and [have them] be like, ‘Hey, where were you? We missed you at the meeting.’”
Venus C. Nnadi ’22, vice president of the Nigerian Students Association, said hosting events virtually does not provide the same “familial” environment as the organization's in-person events did.
“It’s a very unique vibe that we have when we’re all together in one room on campus, and that’s the biggest part about NSA,” Nnadi said.
She added that catered Nigerian food is one of the main draws for students to come to the organization's events.
“Not having that physical space loses a lot of that familial aspect that we have,” Nnadi said.
Despite the many challenges of virtual programming, club leaders said they have been able to find new ways to create engaging activities for their members over Zoom.
Seung Min “Albert” Shin ’22 — diversity co-chair for the Asian American Association — said that since his organization’s events could no longer be held in Quincy Dining Hall, his group looked for ways to offer programming to students remotely.
“We tried to brainstorm the ways that we could bring the events to the homes of students that were attending, whether that be through UberEats, or asking them to prepare small things beforehand like pieces of paper for origami night, or ingredients in order to make food,” Shin said.
Adams added that the Association of Black Harvard Women also experimented with new programming, including a “Paint and PJs” night.
“We sent out a canvas and paint to everybody. We just had a night where everybody’s in the comfort of their own home, wherever they were Zooming in from, in pajamas. It was a good, nice, relaxing thing,” Adams said.
Kaushik said the South Asian Association has allocated extra budget to their “Big Sib Little Sib” program to allow upperclassmen to send presents and food to on-campus and off-campus freshmen. In addition, SAA is adapting Ghungroo — its annual dance, music, and drama production — to a virtual format to help engage its members.
Avi Gulati ’24, a dancer in Ghungroo, said attending meetings to prepare for the show has been a positive way to engage virtually with the club.
“I think that it’s highly enjoyable, because I’m not just getting on a Zoom call to merely talk to people,” Gulati said. "I get to talk to them, and I get to dance. It’s reminiscent of an in-person interaction where we’re all doing something together.”
As cultural groups reflect on the successes and challenges of the fall semester, some group leaders said they are hoping to better adapt their programming for another semester with pandemic restrictions.
SAA and ABHW said they are looking into new platforms besides Zoom to host programming.
“We’re experimenting with using some other things like Instagram Live, which doesn’t allow for personal interaction, but it does still allow for if you want to just come and listen to an SAA alum and someone else on board just have a conversation,” Kaushik said.
Adams said ABHW may hold fewer events in the spring semester to avoid “overwhelming” members with too much programming.
“We expect more people to come, because I think if we’re just having event after event after event, it’s kind of overwhelming for people,” Adams said.
Isabelle L. Guillaume ’24, a Crimson Business associate and diversity co-chair for the Asian American Association, said that the club is “evaluating” their recruiting and programming strategies to better adapt to a virtual setting.
“We are planning on evaluating our previous methods of recruiting people to join AAA,” Guillaume said. “We are also looking at the events that we have held in the past and are trying to make them better so that we can form and foster a more welcoming community over the virtual setting.”

With the endless hours of sitting in front of your laptop on Zoom, maintaining an active life can be challenging. Though you may not have the option to freely head to the Malkin Athletic Center to burn off some energy, there are still ways to keep moving if you wish to do so. Here are a few tips from Flyby to working out without the MAC as we spend a few more months indoors.
Harvard Recreation’s YouTube Channel
Live workout sessions with Harvard Recreation are super motivating and upbeat, but maybe all of the live yoga sessions conflict with your language class, or you think Zumba is more of an afternoon activity and not a 7:30 a.m. one (we feel you). To mitigate time constraints, Harvard Recreation uploaded several videos to follow along with at any time. Whether you want to try pilates for the first time or challenge yourself to a 30-minute HIIT (high-intensity interval training) workout, there is a large variety of options with different instructors available. Because these trainers usually lead classes at Harvard, this may be one of the closest ways to feel like you’re at the MAC.
Zoom Call with Friends
If you’re having trouble keeping a consistent workout schedule, consider setting up a regular schedule with a few buddies to get your heart pumping over a Zoom call. Challenge each other to see who can do the longest plank, the most jumping jacks, and the highest kicks. Or you can all use a virtual background of the Charles River while jogging in place, as if you’re going on a run together like the good ol’ days. At the end, reward yourselves with a cute little Netflix Party.
Creativity with Household Items
If you want to sneak in a few exercises while you’re waiting around for your Internet to connect, for your cup of noodles to heat up, or for your club members to show up, use everyday household items around you. In the common room, transform the futon into a tricep dip apparatus. In your bedroom, pick up your heavy pile of dirty pajamas and carry it to the laundry machine. Sure, you may get some funny looks from the people you live with, but what’s new?
Run Around in Circles
Maybe you’re located in a crowded city with high Covid-19 rates where it is unsafe to be outdoors for a long period of time. Or perhaps there is a foot of snow outside and you simply would rather stay where it’s warm and cozy. If you miss running and don’t have a treadmill, set up a few chairs in a circle and jog around them. And good news — sprinting to the kitchen to quickly grab a banana one minute before your class starts definitely counts as a run!
With another semester of Zoomversity, you’re probably limited in ways to work out. Though our beloved gym may not be physically available, there are still several ways to stay active without the MAC.
