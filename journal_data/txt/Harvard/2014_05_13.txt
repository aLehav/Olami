After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
The first few seconds of The Black Key’s new album, “Turn Blue,” are unmistakably the product of Danger Mouse, the superproducer at the helm of this album. Like most of his recent projects (see: Broken Bells, Norah Jones, Portugal. The Man), there are ghostly noises, tiny bell sounds, and an acoustic guitar so quasi-vintage it sounds like it’s been put through an Instagram filter. The sound is so fully realized that it seems there’s not too much need for The Black Keys to even show up.
 
And they never really do—at least, not in the bluesy, snarling, lo-fi form that they perfected for so many years. This version of The Black Keys is a lot slicker, a lot more marketable, and a lot more aligned with current music trends. Whereas the first Danger Mouse/Black Keys collaboration, 2008’s “Attack & Release,” was sludgy and daring, “Turn Blue” shows The Black Keys folded firmly into the mainstream, picking up tired grooves from Danger Mouse that he probably left lying around his studio two years ago.
 
Danger Mouse has long been an aloof enigma, hiding behind dark glasses and preferring to let his charismatic collaborators, such as Cee-Lo or James Mercer of The Shins, take the spotlight. This detached cool has clearly rubbed off on The Black Keys, who have always been raw, passionate, and sweaty; their imitative attempts feel just as false as a dad putting on skinny jeans for his teenage son’s concert. For example, “In Time” is set up by a corny clave beat and hollow-sounding piano that sound vaguely Macklemore-esque. Guitarist and vocalist Dan Auerbach purrs the melody in wavering falsetto the entire time like any lesser indie singer; on the chorus, an impersonal, emotionless horde of singers screams an MGMT-like anthem that just feels wrong within this context and melody.
 
“Turn Blue” shows The Black Keys playing to their weaknesses again and again. Though they have never had a bassist—in fact, it was their stripped-down, two-man setup that led to so much success early on—“In Time,” the title track, and “10 Lovers” rely heavily on dance bass riffs, which unfortunately but consistently point to why the band never needed them in the first place. Auerbach has one of the most powerful, soulful voices in rock right now, but his falsetto renders him nearly unrecognizable for much of the album, especially on the cloying “Waiting on Words.”
 
The songs here are catchy enough. “Fever,” the first single, and “Bullet in the Brain” rumble along happily through verse-chorus-verse. And in a couple instances, their new musical style pays dividends: “In Our Prime” is an epic, with a couple tempo changes and a face-melting solo. Auerbach tiptoes daintily around the nostalgic lyrics: “Every now and then, I see your face from way back when and I explode.” What they’ve lost in force, they’ve made up for partly in style, and it’s admirable to see them make an effort to evolve.
 
But with the Keys building up their outer walls with trendy bass, synthesizers, and reverb, it’s increasingly hard to see underneath to the tortured, sloppy bluesmen who were so unique and important to the music world. They represented a counterstream of real musicians unbeholden to the unforgiving trends of time; they pounded away with the grit and soul of the Rust Belt, boy bands and pop divas be damned. Now they themselves have entered the tide of pop music, and with that shift their originality has evaporated.
 
“Gotta Get Away,” the closer, is a perfect example. It’s damn catchy, anthemic, and shiny as hell. But it doesn’t sound like a new song, per se—it’s pretty much just a rewriting of Warren Zevon’s “Werewolves of London” or of Kid Rock’s terrible rewrite thereof; it’s a jingle that they play in a car commercial, probably a Chevy ad, where a bunch of stylish people in trendy hats and sunglasses groove down an American highway under a bright blue sky. And you can bet the Keys are in that car, smiling away mindlessly and raking in their advertising deals. Dan and Pat, please get off the highway again and write some new songs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
UPDATED: May 13, 2014, at 3:00 p.m.
With many carrying crosses and singing the words “Jesus, I adore you,” several hundred Catholics, Christians, and other supporters from across the Harvard and greater Boston area processed from MIT to The Church of St. Paul in Harvard Square Monday night in protest of a planned reenactment of a satanic black mass ritual.
The procession culminated in a holy hour of prayer, readings from scripture, and hymns in Harvard’s Catholic Church affiliate, where the crowd spilled out onto the sidewalk.
Around the same time, across campus, about 70 demonstrators from the Catholic Action League of Massachusetts and several members of the American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family, and Property protested outside Memorial Hall, where the black mass, which parodies the Catholic mass, was originally scheduled to be held.
Around 5 p.m., the Extension School Cultural Studies Club, the sponsor of the black mass, wrote in an email that it had decided to relocate and, at 7 p.m., the club announced it was calling off the reenactment. A scaled-back black mass reenactment was eventually held around 11:00 p.m. by the New York-based Satanic Temple in Hong Kong Restaurant and Lounge.
Even as they thought the black mass was cancelled, members of the Christian community continued with plans to come together in opposition to the event.
Christina M. Giordano ’10 said that she attended the rally because Catholics “needed to make a strong showing.” “We need to be proud of our faith,” she added.
“This is essentially the best response we could have asked for as a diocese,” said Catholic Students Association president Todd E. Jones ’16 said of the rally. Like others, he criticized the planned black mass,  but emphasized the power of the community response to it. A petition organized by Matthew R. Menendez ’14 had garnered over 450 signatures of students and alumni by presstime Saturday.
“This [satanic mass] has no positive cultural substance,” Jones added.
Although the Cultural Studies Club assured that a consecrated host would not be used in the ceremony, Jones said that there was confusion initially as to whether or not a consecrated host would be used. While Jones said the outrage would have been “a little different” if the planned reenactment had initially made clear that it would not feature a consecrated host, he still extolled the community’s response.
Seats in St. Paul, which sits at the intersection of Bow and Arrow streets, were quickly filled as the crowd reached the church and the prayer service began. Among those in attendance were University President Drew G. Faust, Reverend Jonathan L. Walton, Pusey Minister in Memorial Church and Plummer Professor of Christian Morals, as well as clergy and laymen from around the Boston area.
Michael E. Drea, the pastor and senior chaplain at St. Paul, delivered a sermon emphasizing the importance of Catholic beliefs and responded directly to the planned black mass, which he described “as an act of hatred and ridicule toward the Catholic church and the faithful.”
Drea concluded his remarks by telling the crowd, “as we depart from this church into the light of Harvard Square...may we be reminded of our call to bring the presence of the living God into the world…. That’s the call of veritas.”
Those who attended the service spoke highly of its ability to bring together people of different beliefs and from across the area.
 
“I was just amazed at how many people even within and outside the Harvard community came together to just like acknowledge and celebrate the beauty of what Catholics hold very dear,” Chisom M. Okpala ’15 said.
Fr. Felipe Gonzalez from Boston’s Cathedral of the Holy Cross said he was “amazed” by the number of people who attended the service. Rebecca E. Tweedie ’14 said that she had “never seen [the church] so full.”
“It was the response we were hoping for,” Gonzalez added. “This is the sense of the community that we all are waiting for.”
Back across the Yard, dozens of protesters gathered outside Memorial Hall offered more direct protestation of the the planned satanic mass.
“We’re just delighted to learn that, first of all, [the event] was taken off of campus, and, second of all, that it was cancelled altogether,” said C.J. Doyle, executive director of the Catholic Action League of Massachusetts. “This had no redeeming social value, it had no intrinsic educational value, this was not a cultural event: this was an exercise in hatred, bigotry, desecration, and denigration.”

CORRECTION: May 13, 2014
An earlier version of this article incorrectly quoted Catholic Students Association President Todd E. Jones ’16 in talking about the value of the planned satanic mass. Jones said that “This [satanic mass] has no positive cultural substance.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s influence in the NFL expanded over the weekend as four graduating members of the Crimson, defensive tackle Nnamdi Obukwelu, longsnapper Tyler Ott, tight end Cam Brate, and defensive back Brian Owusu, signed with NFL teams after going undrafted in the seven-round NFL Draft.
Obukwelu, who recorded 109 tackles and nine sacks over his Harvard career, signed with the Indianapolis Colts Sunday. Ott will not go nearly as far to live his NFL dreams, agreeing to a deal with the nearby New England Patriots. Brate, meanwhile, will return to his Midwestern roots, joining a Minnesota Vikings organization that also includes former Crimson lineman Kevin Murphy.
Lastly, Owusu will return to San Diego, where he had five tackles in a 42-20 win over the University of San Diego Toreros to start the 2013 season. This time, Owusu will be suiting up in Chargers blue and gold.
Princeton defensive tackle Caraun Reid was the only Ivy League player taken in the NFL Draft this year, going in the fifth round, 158th overall to the Detroit Lions. Cornell quarterback Jeff Mathews signed with the Atlanta Falcons after going undrafted.

We’re back again with the best HUDS responder in all the land. We have learned this week that Joe is fond of using images to respond for him—something we heartily endorse.

Someone was (understandably) enthusiastic about those buttermilk pancakes from last week, and another was giving a straight up shout out to this special guy, Joe, and his uncanny ability for finding appropriate pictures off the internet.
Thanks Joe!
