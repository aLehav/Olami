After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last weekend, the no. 15 Harvard men’s water polo team (23-7, 8-3 CWPA) battled no. 13 Princeton in a pivotal matchup, with both teams vying for the Northeast Water Polo Conference championship.
The game was a back-and-forth affair and remained 10-10 after regulation and 11-11 after the first overtime. In the second sudden-death frame, though, freshman Dennis Blyashov ended the event. The attacker juked a defender and skimmed a shot across the water and into the net.
That play proved the difference, as the Crimson topped the Tigers (22-6, 8-3) to earn a trip to the NCAA tournament. This season marked the second-straight year that Harvard has won the title.
Blyashov has been an integral part of Harvard’s offense. The Carlsbad, California, native was recently awarded the NWPC Rookie of the Year and named to the 2017 NWPC All-Conference First Team.
Blyashov has amassed 88 goals on the year, leading the team. His tenacious play has landed him numerous weekly honors. In the Crimson’s opening weekend, Blyashov scored five goals and added six assists at the Bruno Classic, winning him Northeast Water Polo Rookie of the Week honors.
Blyashov went on to win a second Rookie of the Week after scoring eight goals, dishing out four assists, and making three steals, leading Harvard to three victories against Salem International, George Washington, and Gannon.
In October, the attacker captured his third Rookie of the Week, scoring 15 goals overall, including seven in a 13-9 win over Iona. Later that month, Blyashov won Co-Player of the Week honors after a strong weekend in which he scored 14 goals, contributing to the wins against Johns Hopkins, No. 19 Pomona-Pitzer, and George Washington. In later games, Blyashov landed his fourth Rookie of the Week after netting 12 goals.
In the NEWPC Conference tournament, Blyashov helped Harvard best Iona and No. 15 St. Francis. Against the Gaels, he scored six goals; against the Terriers, he added another three.
His most important performance, however, came against Princeton. Besides tallying the winning score, Blyashov added three more goals during the contest.

What now?
This year, the Harvard football team was projected to vie for the Ivy League title with Princeton. By the end of the fall, each squad sat below .500 in conference play, and Yale dominated its way to a 9-1 season and an outright championship.
It is safe to say that the Ivy League football season was unpredictable, even without considering Harvard’s fate. Up until week nine, the press boxes at various Ivy schools were jammed with journalists salivating over the potential seven-way tie for first place scenario. Alas, it didn’t come to fruition, but interesting storylines still abounded week after week.
Would Columbia rise from the dark depths of the league to contend for a title? (The Lions finished in second place with a 5-2 record.) Would Dartmouth ever fail to complete a late-game comeback? (The Big Green ended up squandering a potential game-winning drive against the Crimson.) Would Cornell upset its way to a title berth? (The Big Red beat both Harvard and Princeton in stunning fashion.) Could Brown possibly get worse on a weekly basis? (Yes, it could.)
The last time Harvard finished with a losing record in the Ancient Eight was 1999—clearly the Crimson’s run of dominance was bound to end sometime. As head coach Tim Murphy would say, Harvard has enjoyed a “bull market” in the league for an inordinate amount of time.
So how does the Crimson regain its former glory? Well, it already has a solid core of returning players. Most notably, the incoming senior class is full of talented athletes who have already cemented themselves as stars in Cambridge.
Wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley has further established himself as one of the premier punt and kick returners in the nation. This season, he finished third in the FCS in punt return average with 18.8 yards per attempt. Adam Scott and Charlie Booker are other junior skill players who will play larger roles next year and will complement Shelton-Mosley’s offense.
Aside from established veterans, some key role players and stars-in-the-making will be important to the team’s redemption attempt next year. Freshman quarterback Jake Smith will likely take the reins on day one, and breakout junior receiver Henry Taylor (337 yards and three touchdowns in 2017) will diversify the Crimson’s group of wideouts.
Though Harvard is losing a few senior tight ends, we have seen appearances by junior Dan Werner and sophomore John Stivers this season. That duo could wind up fitting into the classic halfback/tight end role in Murphy’s system.
On the defensive side, the next Crimson football team may be thinner in the secondary due to the departures of key contributors Tanner Lee, Tim Haehl, Tobe Ezeokoli, and Raishaun McGhee. Zach Miller, who was just elected Harvard’s 145th captain, aims to reinvigorate the unit, along with juniors Cole Thompson and Wes Ogsbury and freshman Isaiah Wingfield.
The defensive front and the linebacker corps should prove to be solid in 2018. Defensive end DJ Bailey will return—despite being injured for several games, the junior still posted 23 tackles and four sacks. Rising seniors Charlie Walker and Anthony Camargo, along with sophomore Joey Goodman, will anchor the linebackers.
But before all that, before we see the Crimson take the field again in mid-September of 2018, we have to wait through a long, tedious, football-less offseason. For fans, Harvard’s season unfortunately takes up only a fifth of the calendar year. Without winter workouts, spring football, and preseason prep of our own, we must wait until the very end of next summer to see Harvard Stadium abuzz with the activity of hundreds of players and tens of thousands of fans, as reported by Harvard Athletics.
Not to disparage the Athletic Department in any way, but I’ve been working on a half-serious conspiracy theory on game attendance. I think we all know that the smattering of fans throughout the Stadium’s concrete bleachers on windy, rainy, sub-freezing days does not add up to approximately 10,000 reported attendants. And wouldn’t you know it? The school’s fight song is titled “Ten Thousand Men of Harvard.” Really makes you think.
That aside, Harvard football is a timeless institution around Cambridge, and I will certainly miss it during the dreary winter ahead. It is no SEC, but the Ivy League is filled with historic stadiums and wacky traditions that are unparalleled elsewhere in college football. It may not be as popular as it once was, but it still brings joy year after year to alumni, current students, and completely impartial college journalists alike.
Until next year….

If you’re from overseas or across the United States, or you’re just too lazy to pack like me, then you might be in need of a couple things to do on or near campus over Thanksgiving Recess. Well, you came to the perfect place.
Black Friday
Grab someone else who’s on campus—if anyone’s around, that is—and head on over to a mall like Cambridgeside Galleria for some amazing sales the Friday after Thanksgiving Day (the 24th this year). You might get trampled in the process, but the new clothes you got as a steal will be so worth it.
Get that bod you always wanted
Thanksgiving Recess is the ideal time to take advantage of the usually at-maximum-capacity MAC and Hemenway. Get yourself back into shape after basically having no time to hit the gym during the semester, and especially after stuffing your face with Turkey stuffing.
Write a letter back home
Even though you’re not going to be physically with your family if you stay on campus, try to keep in touch. Take a couple minutes out of your day and make a nice card for your relatives—maybe tell them what college has been like, what you miss about home, what you are looking forward to the next semester, what you are scared of (aka switching into a double). Don’t be afraid to be a little cheesy. Embrace the wholesomeness.
Stay in
Whoever said it’s boring to stay in bed all day, curled up with four blankets, hot cocoa, and a cliche book or Netflix show clearly doesn’t know how to live. After an exhausting three months on campus, we all need some downtime. Recharge before we jump right back into … *scary music rumbles in the background* … reading period.
“Dine in presidential style” for a night
The Franklin Delano Roosevelt Foundation at Adams House is hosting a Thanksgiving Eve Reception at the new and improved FDR suite (B-17) on Wednesday, November 22nd from 4.30 p.m. to 6:15 p.m.. Sign up is full as of right now, but if you check this link out you might be able to get on the waiting list.
Get in the spirit and volunteer 
Y-2-Y and Harvard Square Homeless Shelter are always looking for volunteers to staff their shelters, especially during the break when many regular volunteers are not in town. Visit their websites and sign up for a shift!
Get cultured 
Although the Harvard Art Museums are closed on Thanksgiving Day, they are free during the rest of the recess. Take a visit, analyze some pieces of art, and feel 10 times smarter than you did before. Gain some knowledge to impress your friends when you rave about Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern Bronzes (a special collection on display).
Movie night
No time to watch the latest blockbusters during the semester? Thanksgiving Recess is a perfect time to do just that! Head over to a movie theater in Boston with friend for a chance to see movies everyone is talking about.
Get in the Christmas spirit? 
Visit Boston’s iconic Faneuil Hall Marketplace to enjoy the holiday lights and tree on display already. (Yes, it is November.) While the Marketplace is closed on Thanksgiving day, it will be open to visitors and shoppers alike on Friday. After shopping, head over to the Winter Holiday Market on City Hall Plaza. Enjoy an ice-skating rink, hot chocolate, and small vendors.
Friendsgiving!
Get together with other friends staying on campus and prepare a wholesome “Thanksgiving” meal. Whether you bake your own cookies or steal them from the dining hall, this meal can be a great time to reconnect with your friends after the rush of midterm season.
