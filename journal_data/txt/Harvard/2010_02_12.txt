After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Sunday, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad announced that his country would begin enriching its uranium stockpiles beyond the 3.5 percent threshold necessary for electricity generation. Ostensibly, the move is designed to allow for the production of medical isotopes. But many nuclear security experts note that the announced plan for 20 percent enrichment enables Iran to perform 90 percent of the process necessary to produce weapons-grade uranium under the guise of medical research. As such, the United States must take a very strong stance against further Iranian enrichment on both the domestic and international fronts.
Iran’s current enrichment activities are in direct contravention of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1696 and 1737, which demanded that Tehran halt enrichment and slapped sanctions on the Islamic Republic. In light of recent developments, new sanctions have been proposed, but China’s refusal to approve any additional penalties for Iran has stymied hopes that coordinated international action might stop Iran’s rulers from pursuing a bomb. The United States must make it clear to China that its actions are absolutely unacceptable and constitute an irresponsible policy for a nation so committed to its own “peaceful rise.”
Similarly, despite extant federal legislation, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, many U.S. companies continue to do business with Iran, providing dual-use technology and capital that allow the regime in Tehran to continue what could be the pursuit of an atomic arsenal. The Obama administration must crack down on all companies that violate currently existing regulations and propose more stringent and targeted restrictions on trade with Iran. Its latest move—imposing more sanctions on front companies for the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard—is a good start. Washington should also reach out to other countries, urging them to adopt similar stringent bans on the export of all dual-use technology, especially equipment that could be used to facilitate further enrichment.
Iran claims that its nuclear program is intended only for peaceful purposes like power generation and medical research. If so, then it needs to show its commitment to said purposes by returning to the negotiating table and adopting one of the compromise plans drafted by the international community. Last month, President Ahmadinejad publicly rejected a reasonable proposal to have Iran export the vast majority of its uranium stockpiles to Russia, to be processed under international safeguards. Without even considering these options, the Iranian government cannot claim that the international community is somehow denying its sovereign rights under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
If Iran continues on its present course, the Middle East—already one of the most unstable regions of the world—could face the threat of nuclear war. The United States must continue to seek a compromise that all parties can follow, while also conveying to Tehran that its current actions will not be tolerated. Strong international sanctions, a firm export policy, and effective international diplomacy will be necessary in order to address the danger of uranium enrichment in Iran.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the beginning of Frank Capra’s 1946 classic masterpiece, “It’s a Wonderful Life,” protagonist George Bailey, played by James Stewart, asks his aging father why the family still runs a penny-ante Building and Loan. His father replies quietly, “George, I feel that in a small way we are doing something important: Satisfying a fundamental urge. It’s deep in the race for a man to want his own roof and walls and fireplace, and we’re helping him get those things in our shabby little office.” Later in the film, Bailey remembers his father’s words as he tussles with the evil Mr. Potter and his scheme to force poor-quality housing on the working poor of Bedford Falls.
Over the past few weeks, blogger Arianna Huffington and economist Robert Johnson have launched a viral social media campaign to convince Americans to transfer their funds to local community banks like George Bailey’s. The video for the “Move Your Money” campaign mashes scenes from “It’s a Wonderful Life” with cuts from the Congressional bailout hearings. The campaign equates the Big Four banks (Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo) with Mr. Potter and his cronies. It also encourages Americans to send a message “that we have had enough of the high-flying, no-limits-casino banking culture that continues to dominate Wall Street and Capitol Hill.”
We don’t live in the black-and-white world of George Bailey. But there are still lessons to be learned from “It’s a Wonderful Life.” The tone of the Move Your Money campaign is a little too vengeful. Although the banks certainly have much more to answer for, the campaign masks the fact that irresponsible borrowers also played a hand in the fall of our house of cards. And yet, the chief message of the movement, that customer should make finance more local for the common good, is critical to America’s economic and social recovery.
As for hurting the big banks, it is likely Huffington’s campaign won’t accomplish much. Many fear community banks may be too small to succeed. As Martha C. White notes in a recent Washington Post piece, the Big Four don’t make much money directly off of customer deposits: Although total deposits at Bank of America are around a trillion dollars, customer deposits are only around $83 billion. On the other hand, Felix Salmon, the financial columnist at Reuters, suggests that because The Big Four make a large profit through habitual overdraft frees, moving deposits could make a significant dent.
In any case, the worthiest aspect of the move your money campaign isn’t its potential to punish Wall Street. George Bailey wasn’t as concerned with vengeance against Potter so much as helping his neighbors achieve the American dream of financial security.
Moving money to smaller banks can do much to protect the ordinary American family. Small banks are not as exposed to the complicated securities that brought down the bigger banks. Although they generally don’t offer the same kind of services as larger banks, such as omnipresent ATMs, they are generally more reliable in tough times. In an interview last Sunday on National Public Radio, Dr. Simon Johnson, former chief economist of the IMF, noted that smaller community banks generally offer better deals, fairer treatment, and better terms on accounts than their competitors. They are more closely woven into the social fabric, and less likely to sell ordinary Americans down the river.
Although moving money to community banks won’t reform the banking system, it still makes sense for the broader economy. Since the beginning of his term, Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke has advocated for an increased role for community banks. Although getting credit flowing was a condition of the bailout, the big banks have been reluctant to lend to small businesses, instead preferring to use their money for trading. If small banks can extend credit to strong borrowers in small businesses, they will help fuel job creation. Unfortunately, like Bailey’s bank in the film, these banks are now strapped for capital, and are unable to help the businesses and households they’ve supported in the past.
Lately, the administration has acknowledged the value of community banks for recovery. President Obama promised $30 billion of repaid TARP money to community banks in the State of the Union address. A separate program is being created to pump capital into banks in distressed in cities like Cleveland, Chicago, and Detroit. There are many complications with these efforts, but they must be overcome, as most attempts to boost employment will have little effect if the small business credit lines aren’t fixed.
Ultimately, moving money into community banks serves a greater purpose than populist retribution and perhaps even greater than rapid recovery. Community banks can help restore trust in the banking system and the economy in general. Perhaps the kind of neighborly faith found in Capra’s film is long gone. There are few George Bailey’s around any more, if there were ever many. But we would all do well to remember that a moral order undergirds American capitalism and being able to trust the person behind the money counter is key to both our material prosperity and social welfare.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Like most people currently attending this college, I knew a fair amount about quite a few things when I was in high school. I could tell you who the twenty-eighth president of the United States was or ramble coherently about central place theory. I was able to integrate things. If someone handed me DNA helicase, I would have known what to do with it. I even knew what the word “reticent” meant. Now I’m not so sure. This doesn’t keep me from using it in sentences. “Have you tried the butternut squash soup?” I ask my friends. “I hear it’s really reticent today.”
Recently, during a study at the business school, someone posed me a relatively simple question about the number of elves required to make X widgets in four hours if one elf could make Z widgets in two hours. I was instantly bewildered. “I think this is a real commentary on elf working conditions,” I wrote next to the question, before bursting into tears and muttering something about post-feminism.
Of course, we should know better. The moment the class of 2010 arrived at Harvard, we were treated to a talk by Dean Jeremy Knowles, who informed us that the main benefit of a Harvard education was that it would enable us to “talk rot” intelligently and—more importantly—to identify when others were talking rot. He was certainly right about the first part. I have described more things as “post-structuralist critiques of modern mores” than I can shake a stick at. I have no idea what any of those words mean, but when strung together in that order they seem to have quite a startling effect on people. It has gotten to the point where I work this phrase into as many sentences as possible. “Want to come back to my place?” I ask dates. “I’ll show you my post-structuralist critique of modern mores.” So far, this has yet to work, but I have great hopes.
But the problem lies in the second part. Sure, I’m able to talk rot. But four years of college have taken away my ability to tell if others are talking rot as well. Beyond what I’ve learned in my concentration, I’m amazed how little knowledge I’ve managed to accrue since arriving at Harvard. As a starry-eyed freshman, I signed up for a proof-based linear algebra class instantly after arriving. “I will not regret this!” I informed my somewhat bemused parents. “Rigorous proof-based linear algebra is something I see playing a pivotal role in my future.” Now I’m an English concentrator. Math 23 spelled the end of my relationship with math—doomed, like many modern relationships, by trying to go too far too fast. I filled the rest of my “hard science” requirement by taking a course called “Nanothings.” I’m not saying that this course wasn’t a rigorous exploration of new science, but one of the “Key Lessons” of the entire semester was “Small things are different.” Instead of a final paper, I wrote a play about a ray of light trying to decide if he were a particle or a wave. I enjoyed myself tremendously, but, as a consequence of this class, you can tell me that someone has built a tiny robot capable of reading all our minds and I will believe you. “Sounds about right,” I will say, nodding sagely. “Small things are different.”
Since coming to college, I have learned extremely little about a bizarre range of oddly specific subjects. And it’s not strictly my fault. The Core—or now, Gen Ed—curriculum caters to our basest impulses. If you can get away with studying dinosaurs instead of taking a rigorous survey of new developments in science, why wouldn’t you? Who doesn’t love a good dinosaur? Besides, it only meets on Tuesdays and Thursdays, so it won’t conflict with all the rigorous drinking you have scheduled. And this problem isn’t just for science. To receive credit for Historical Study, I can take courses as broad as American Constitutional History from the Framing to the Present or as narrow as Frontiers of Europe: Ukraine Since 1500. I’m not saying that Ukraine isn’t deeply significant, but if I can graduate from college without knowing anything about the history of something that isn’t Ukraine, that seems like it’ll make me irritating at cocktail parties. Sure, they say those who don’t know history are doomed to repeat it. But as long as the part I’m repeating is the part where America prospers and makes strides in civil rights instead of the part with slavery and no flush toilets, this ought to be fine.
Whenever I suggest that I’ve gotten dumber since going to college, my friends nod sympathetically. Part of this is because of the apparently inevitable narrowing of interest that follows a decision to concentrate in one subject rather than another, to read Milton instead of Machiavelli. Part of this stems from the distribution requirements that allow us to graduate with smatterings of disconnected, specific bits of knowledge rather than any sort of larger picture. But it also stems from the way information itself has evolved. Since we were in high school, we’ve moved into a model where knowledge is increasingly stored “off-site.” Instead of memorizing trivia or reading books, we google things. If someone somewhere out there has the answers, and we can obtain them at the press of a button, why bother actually learning? We’re quickly turning into a generation of intellectual Blanche Duboises—depending on the kindness of strangers for everything from facts about plants to driving directions. But something gets lost in this process. Because we could hypothetically know everything, no one winds up knowing anything. And if the benevolent person out there who has the particular fact we want ceases to be benevolent—if Google censors its search results, or if, in the perpetual shouting match of the internet, the facts appear to conflict—it becomes impossible to sort out the rot from the not. Little knowledge is a dangerous thing.
Then again, Socrates said that the beginning of wisdom is the knowledge of your own ignorance. Maybe that’s what this is.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Five and a half years ago, I was a 15-year old middle school student in Beijing, busy preparing for the high school entrance exams. One day, I received a letter that changed my life forever. It was an introduction to a New England boarding school that accepted international students and provided need-based financial aid. I decided to give it a shot, not really expecting to get in. But I was lucky. In Sept. 2004, I came to the U.S. for the first time in my life to attend 10th grade.
What initially attracted me to the idea of attending boarding school and college halfway across the globe was the vast range of opportunities that educational institutions in the U.S. offer to students. There are so many different courses that I can take and such a variety of extracurricular activities that I can choose from. In high school, I had time to play in the orchestra, do Model U.N., and learn squash, all in the same semester. I was given the chance to develop not only within the classroom, but also outside of it.
Chinese high school students do not have access to such luxury. Most students sit at their desks all day, doing practice math problems or memorizing lines from ancient Chinese prose. I remember visiting a 12th grade classroom once and seeing students buried in huge piles of practice tests and reference guides, hunched low, and writing frantically. It was not a fun scene.
The key factor behind such stark contrasts between the two countries is the difference between their respective college entrance systems. In China, a student has only one shot at entering college every year through the Gaokao, a college entrance examination held annually in June. My teachers used to tell us, “One point, one soccer field,” meaning that if you dropped one point of the Gaokao, you would drop back as many places in the rankings as the number of people you could fit on a soccer field. Imagine the SATs being 10 times as hard as they are now (especially the math part), having only one chance to take the SATs every year, and having your scores completely determine which college you were admitted to. You’d probably cut your daily two-hour dose of hoops and instead spend the time on math problems too.
Chinese students are no less fun-loving than the average American student. We used to complain all the time to our teachers about our heavy workload, but their response was always that examinations were the fairest solution for a country in which 10 million students apply to college every year. If China adopted the American system, the argument went, not only would there be huge logistical problems, but it would also be practically impossible to prevent corruption. This makes sense. However, I would argue that logistical and fairness problems alone cannot explain the difference. If there really were a strong will, educators would surely be able to come up with innovative ways of tweaking the system so that it is not wholly dependent upon test results.
I suspect that there is a deeper and more fundamental cultural difference between American and Chinese education. Historically in China, going to school was about acquiring knowledge. Students memorized passages from ancient authors like Confucius over and over again until students fully grasped the underlying meanings of the texts and were ready to take the Imperial Examinations—which were first instituted in 605 CE—to become a member of the Chinese bureaucracy. It wasn’t about doing community service, learning leadership skills, or building social networks. This tradition was so strong that even Mao could not dismantle it: although Confucius was denounced and the Gaokao suspended for ten years during the Cultural Revolution, the ancient educational philosophy focusing on the teaching of knowledge never really went away.
Furthermore, while I personally chose to study abroad because of the wide range of opportunities that American education offered, I do believe that the Chinese system still has many advantages. Chinese students excel at math and science because they do a lot of practice problems and become good at it. Socially, because everyone takes the same classes, students are in one classroom with the same fifty classmates for most of high school. Classmates bond with one another in this close environment and establish life-long friendships. In comparison, American students can meet more people in their different classes, but it is much harder to make a large number of close friends because you spend less time with them.
Time flies. Sometimes I just cannot believe that it’s been five years since I first stepped on that flight to America. Of course, I miss my family and friends back home, as well as the food (no offense to HUDS). Nevertheless, I have never regretted coming here for school. I have had access to resources and opportunities that were unimaginable in China, and thanks to American education I have been able to develop both personally and intellectually. I hope that in the future, more and more of my American friends can take a journey in the opposite direction and grow by experiencing China, just as I had broadened my perspectives by coming here.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Mar. 2008, I was one of 245,617 aspirants in Mumbai preparing to take the Common Entrance Test for Engineering. However, reading the acceptance email from Harvard that March morning changed everything. I was no longer a statistic. Harvard, the exclusive, prestigious Harvard, wanted me!
Being a student in India is very different from being a student in the U.S. In the Indian education system your sense of achievement is intertwined with your academic performance. Exams are usually out of a 100 points, and the students who get the highest percentage points get into the best colleges. With an ever-increasing population, competition is cutthroat. In the U.S., college applications are all about differentiating yourself with your extracurriculars while maintaining a high academic standard. However, being a successful Indian student means having impeccable academics, period.
I was an aspiring engineer in junior college (which is equivalent to junior and senior year of high school). Getting into Harvard made me question whether I wanted to commit to a technical school, and consequently a technical degree. The person who interviewed me for Harvard had only just graduated from Harvard in 2007.
He spoke about the amazing resources that I would have as a Harvard student: the world-class athletic facilities, the company of a student body that would include Olympians, musicians and actors alike, the opportunity to take humanities classes with humanities concentrators and an environment in which I could truly challenge myself. I, a prospective engineering student, was sold on the idea of a liberal arts education, which is impossible to pursue in India.
Speaking to my friends back home, I sense a certain frustration and discontentment with the higher education system in India. Exams are held in the middle and at the end of every semester and these exams determine the GPA. On paper, it seems comparable to a semester in the U.S., but that could not be farther from the truth. I hear that attending college day-to-day feels like a chore, there are no term-time assignments (papers or problem sets in Harvard-speak), lecturers are disinterested and discrepancies in lab reports can be “fixed” by paying the friendly college peon. Skipping lectures is normal and students sometimes sign-in for their absent counterparts, a practice termed as “proxy.” I have heard horror stories of proxies being discovered resulting in the penalization or even suspension of the involved parties.
Exams present an enormous challenge of their own. Some colleges in Mumbai are private and they conduct their own examinations. However, the majority of engineering colleges in Mumbai are affiliated with a central authority called Mumbai University. All such colleges take University exams. Answer papers from one college are sent to another for correction to ensure impartiality. Loss of answer papers and general confusion are rampant in this process. A friend of mine was certain that he had done really well on his computer science exam. To his dismay, however, his result sheet indicated that he had failed. He petitioned to have his exam re-evaluated. It was only after he had been forced to re-take the exam the following semester that the re-evaluated results were sent to him—he had passed with flying colors the first time around.
Higher education in India is a constant struggle against the system. However, I would argue that India produces some of the world’s most brilliant graduates. Students in the Indian education system succeed not because of their education but in spite of it. They teach themselves by reading in textbooks what their professors failed to teach. They overcome administrative hurdles unimaginable by American students to get what they want.
In contrast, higher education in the U.S. is cycle of tests, assignments, and deadlines culminating in the final exam, all every well organized. These classes, along with extracurricular commitments and jobs, create an American college semester. It is, in one word, exhausting. I have worked harder at Harvard than I have ever worked in my life. I certainly put in more work daily than my counterparts do back in India. But I enjoy every minute of it, even the excruciating nights before a problem set is due. I value assignments that challenge me, a variety of extracurriculars, and caring professors, because to my friends in India these are luxuries. I almost feel that I push myself at Harvard as much as I do because I owe it to my friends in the Indian education system to make the most of my Harvard experience.
In conclusion, I chose to come to Harvard because I wanted to have the opportunity to engage in cutting-edge research as a sophomore, learn from professors who are passionate about their students, row on the Charles as part of the novice crew team, learn Spanish, and pursue my interest in technology at the same time. Would I have had a less successful career had I pursued higher education in India? The answer is an emphatic “no,” because maneuvering through college in India would have equipped me with a skin thick enough to overcome any setbacks in the future.

My first impression when I first arrived at Harvard was that I had entered an entirely new and different world. This university had its own police department, its own housing system and, most impressive, its own currency in the form of Crimson Cash. I come from Brazil and study at EAESP-FGV, the nation’s top business college. I confess, though, that my biggest dream had always been to go to Harvard University, which has one of the best business schools in the world. But leaving my family and country behind was too difficult, so I reluctantly settled to instead attend Harvard Summer School this past summer.
As soon as I arrived at my room, Leverett F-Tower number 97, I knew that there was something different in the air. Harvard is a beautiful place in the summer time—right on the banks of the Charles River. One of the greatest things about Harvard, which isn’t common at all in my country, is that I found people there from all over the world. I had two neighbors from China, two from America and even one Puerto Rican! This diversity, which I think is essential to any top educational environment, is nowhere near as present in my country. We welcome around 100 foreign exchange students every semester at my college, but they don’t actually go to school with us; rather, they attend separate classes. Once the semester is over, even if they leave with a really nice experience, and maybe some friends, I don’t think their experiences in Brazil quite compare to mine in Cambridge. As my summer there went by, I started noticing all the differences between my country and upbringing and those of my new friends.
At an American high school, students worry about getting through school with good grades and figuring out which major to pursue in college. It’s only after college that they go on to learn a profession. In Brazil, we don’t have that collegiate gap. Graduate school and college are one in the same. As soon as we leave high school, we have to choose what we’re going to do for the rest of our lives. That’s quite a responsibility for a 17-year-old, I would say. Our sole responsibility is to study hard for a very difficult admissions exam, the content of which depends on the type of college we choose to attend. In the U.S., however, I met people who, by the age of 17, had already traveled the world, participated in national science competitions, or used unimaginable skills to do advanced research. Hearing these stories about people of such a young age was really impressive because they would be very rare in Brazil. As I spoke to my American friends, they told me that if you want to go to schools like Harvard you are stimulated to do these kinds of amazing things.
In Brazil, college has a totally different goal than it does in the U.S.. We prepare students to be marketable industry professionals as soon as possible. The extra-curricular opportunities from which students may choose to participate in are entirely focused on the development of market-related skills like leadership, team-work, analytical skills, and working under pressure. We have what we call Junior Enterprises, which are student-run companies that provide consultancy work for real-world companies at a low cost. These are run independently by student groups, so that we can gain some practical experience before going on to work for real companies. As CEO of “RH Junior Consultoria,” a company that provides human resources consultation, I got to coordinate employee selection processes for Nestlé and competency projects for Citigroup. The experience certainly taught me valuable real world skills.
After this period of Junior Enterprise, we begin an internship in an industry of our choice. We don’t have summer internships like those popular in the U.S. Instead, we start working part-time for companies in industries related to our majors. We do this all while going to school and taking 9-subjects per semester!
Here in Brazil I believe there is a deficiency—we lack a period of time in which students can develop the maturity necessary for adult life. This contrasts with the U.S., where students have an undergraduate program centered on that objective. However, I believe that the American educational system should invest more in technically-oriented student activities like the ones we have in Brazil. Such work tends to develop industry-specific skills that are essential for a professional who wants to differentiate himself nowadays.
On the other hand, here in Brazil I guess people are led to “become an adult” sooner than they actually should. Even though we stimulate activities that develop a more market-specific professional who is better prepared to deal with pressure, multi-tasking and who has market-specific skills, there are important things to learn about citizenship, arts, and culture that our educators allow to pass by unnoticed. We definitely lose a lot from this. In spite of this deficiency, I believe we develop stronger professionals with practical and theoretical skills that are above average. However, I also believe that although students in the U.S. may lack this focus in college, they are more mature and well-prepared to make important life decisions like choosing a major and a profession to pursue once they graduate. All in all, I believe both education systems have their advantages and disadvantages, and a lot to learn from each other.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I eventually found a comfortable place to sit. After searching aimlessly for 20 minutes, there it was: a quaint little corner desk in the far-end of the main library room. I immediately dumped the 10 or so books I had checked out of the library earlier that day and sat down on my hard wooden chair, ready for a night full of fun and revelry writing my paper about globalization in the Middle East. I was surrounded by dozens of students; all I could hear was incessant typing, the clicking of pens, and on occasion, the creak of some old dusty chairs. As I began to procrastinate, anticipating an endless night at Lamont Library, it saddened me to think how quickly time has passed during my two years here. Although I am in the middle of my third year at Harvard, it still feels like it was yesterday when I was sitting awkwardly and confused in the “Saudi National Education” class back in my high school in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia—a class that, to this day, I do not understand.
I had always gone to an all-Arabic school in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia, and only moved to the U.S. for my college education. My transition from the Saudi educational system to that of the United States has been far from easy. This is a result of the conflicting approaches to education adopted in the U.S. and in my native country.
One of the fundamental drawbacks of the Saudi academic system is its imposition of a national curriculum that does not vary across any public or private high school. The system requires that every student study identical academic material in the sciences, literature, and math regardless of where a student’s interest lies. Additionally, the material offered in many of these subjects is extremely lacking; history topics only cover the Islamic era, honors classes are nonexistent, and English classes are only available after the seventh grade at public high schools.
But more regrettable is the academic approach promoted at these Saudi schools; teachers encourage a system of ineffective memorization and a superficial understanding of facts for the sole purpose of passing a test. This type of education extends far beyond high school to the college and university levels. Students are continuously taught of ways to pass an exam rather than the proper approaches to learning.
Conversely, American educational methods require one to fully immerse oneself in the subject at hand and to wrestle with concepts that extend further beyond the subject material. Throughout my time here at school in the U.S., never once was I given information to automatically digest without truly understanding the subject matter properly. The education system in the U.S. pushes one to follow his or her passion and truly pursue areas that one has never explored before. My beliefs and thoughts have continuously been challenged to help nurture and stimulate my intellectual ability. U.S. higher education helps students express their opinions, regardless of what stance students take or contrasting argument they might make.
However, to criticize a teacher’s arguments in a Saudi school is unimaginable. It is not uncommon in Saudi Arabia for students to be completely silenced if they question the validity of a professor’s argument. I personally have been dismissed from the classroom countless times during high school for simply challenging the teacher’s line of reasoning.
Educational systems in the U.S. have adopted a system where students are encouraged to contemplate conflicting opinions to strengthen and reinforce the quality of debates that might arise in the classroom.
Critical thinking is essential to a healthy and progressive education. Unfortunately, this type of instruction is not employed within the borders of Saudi Arabia at the high school or college level. Saudi schools do not emphasize the importance of independent thinking, opting instead to conveniently spoon-feed students information that does not test their mental capabilities.
My native country’s lack of an education that encourages critical thinking is the main reason that I decided to further pursue my education abroad. The liberal education environment that universities in the U.S. offer is truly unmatched. Flexibility among courses and tracks of study cultivate a stronger and healthier environment for the student regardless of the field he or she decides to practice. At a university in the U.S., I am able to widen my intellectual horizons, to follow my true passions, and most importantly, I am able to work alongside my fellow students to achieve my full potential. As a student of Harvard I have gained the knowledge, skills, and wisdom necessary to improve Saudi Arabia’s approach to education as I head back home after graduation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four prominent social sciences professors specializing in economics offered a bleak future for the Western markets in the third semi-annual Dean’s Conversation panel yesterday.
Economics Department Chair John Y. Campbell moderated a spirited discussion between Economic Professors Jeremey C. Stein and Kenneth S. Rogoff, and History Professor Niall C. D. Ferguson. The panel touched upon poor short-term investment strategies in western countries, faulty “fire marshalling” of these investments, and China’s comparatively better economic health.
Rogoff—whom Campbell introduced as one of the economists on the panel who accurately forecasted the current economic crisis—discussed the lack of proper monitoring of mass short-term debt.
Rogoff compared borrowers to the members of the audience who, instead of sitting in the second row, stood in the back of the room “in case [the panel] is boring and they want to get out.”
“People get nervous and want to get out quickly when borrowing,” Rogoff added.
He said that such trends created “big vulnerability” in the American market, which ultimately collapsed—as Rogoff had predicted in a paper about a year and a half ago.
On his part, Ferguson said that he does not agree with “the rationalizations of other economists.” Instead of relying upon mathematical models like most economists, Ferguson said he used the field of history to better predict economic trends.
“I looked at what actually had happened—not at some mathematical model,” Ferguson said. “History shows us that when liquidity dries up, then there’s a problem.”
Ferguson also said he believed that China’s recent recovery from its economic crisis proved its long-term stability—perhaps posing competition to western economic power.
“We are living through a turning point at which the East overtakes the West, unless something drastic occurs,” Ferguson said. “China will have a larger GDP in 2027 than America.”
But America is nevertheless friendlier to entrepreneurship than China is—a valuable asset, Ferguson said, for the future of American finance.
Social Sciences Divisional Dean Stephen M. Kosslyn introduced yesterday’s panel discussion as a deliberate attempt to initiate conversations.
“My hope has been events like this will start conversations later,” Kosslyn said, “with members not only from the same school but also actually from the same department.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Climate change has converted Henry David Thoreau’s beloved Walden Pond into a battle site between native and non-native plant species, and it seems as though the non-natives—particularly invasives—are emerging victorious, according to a study published by Harvard researchers last month.
The implications of the findings may have a "devastating" impact on biodiversity in Concord, according to Assistant Professor of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Charles C. Davis, one of the study’s lead researchers.
The scientists discovered that over the past 100 years, invasive plant species have adjusted the times at which they flower to be about 11 days earlier than the flowering times of native species.
The adaptation has resulted in an increase of invasive species, which tend to disrupt ecosystems and require expensive management when they interfere with agriculture.
Davis said he believes that the knowledge offered by the study will help scientists to keep a cautious eye on non-native species that may eventually become invasive.
The current study built upon work performed over the past decade by Boston University professor Richard B. Primack ’72 and Abraham J. Miller-Rushing of the USA National Phenology Network and the Wildlife Society. The pair hunted for botanical records from Concord’s past to track changes in plant traits over the last 150 years—and fortunately, eastern Massachusetts proved to be “a treasure trove of historical records,” Primack said.
Primack and Miller-Rushing proceeded to record observations of about 500 species of plants at Walden Pond over a period of six years. Combining old and new data sets, the duo concluded that seasonal plant traits were shifting as climate change pushed springtime earlier.
"What really piqued my interest was that it wasn’t across the board—some species were shifting and others weren’t," Davis said. "For a person that thinks a lot about life on earth, this immediately struck me as interesting. I wondered, 'Is there a pattern?'"
To find the answer, Davis and his colleagues began to paint a unified evolutionary picture of plant species inhabiting Walden Pond.
The work proved challenging because many of the plants described by Thoreau, a Harvard alum, have been renamed or regrouped over the past century, according to graduate student Brad R. Ruhfel. But when Davis suggested cutting Thoreau’s data, Primack was in firm opposition to the idea.
"I said 'Don’t even think about that,'" Primack recalled. "[The study] connects a literary and philosophical source to one of the most important scientific issues of our time."
Graduate student Charles G. Willis, one of the study’s researchers, emphasized that the findings in Concord are just “one data point in the whole scheme of things,” but that to expand the research to other regions may prove challenging.
"There weren’t Thoreaus everywhere in the world, so we have to look around and find other data sets that can tell us the same story," Willis said.
Interestingly, the researchers’ botanical work has become associated with hot-button issues like climate change and historical figures like Thoreau, according to Ruhfel.
"The science on its own and the results are really stunning, but to have the connection with Thoreau amplifies the excitement all the more given his legacy as a conservationist," Davis said. "This is a very effective vehicle for delivering this message in a timely way."

Almost half of Americans believe that the H1N1 swine flu outbreak has passed, and only one-third remain “somewhat” or “very” concerned about catching the virus, reflecting a significant reduction in levels of concern about the pandemic compared to last fall.
The Harvard School of Public Health poll is the latest in a series of nationwide surveys administered since last April by the Harvard Opinion Research Program to gauge the public’s attitudes and responses to the outbreak.
The poll also revealed that fears about vaccine shortages have mostly abated, as 70 percent of adults surveyed now believe there are adequate vaccine supplies in their communities. A poll last November had found that only 21 percent believed their communities were sufficiently prepared.
One of the survey’s most significant findings is that almost half of the parents polled do not intend to get their children vaccinated, according to Gillian K. SteelFisher, a HSPH researcher and the assistant director of the research program. The main reason cited by the parents concerned the vaccine’s safety, which points to the challenges in communication between the public and health officials, SteelFisher noted.
“There’s no shortage of vaccines anymore, but the people who aren’t getting the vaccines may have concerns that weren’t addressed by these outreach efforts,” SteelFisher said.
Though the poll shows waning public concern about getting sick, Stephen C. Redd, director of the Influenza Coordination Unit for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, cautioned against complacency.
“Rates of H1N1 disease are lower than they were in October and November, but the virus is still circulating and many people remain susceptible to disease,” Redd wrote in an e-mailed statement. “People who are not vaccinated should get vaccinated.”
According to University Health Services Director David S. Rosenthal ’59, the responses to the nationwide poll mirror those within the Harvard community.
“I think that a lot of people are fatigued of H1N1,” Rosenthal said, noting that while UHS had experienced a rush of individuals seeking the vaccine from November to January—when over 5,000 shots were administered—only about 50 students a day have shown up at recent clinics.
The drop-off in fear has accompanied an enormous reduction in cases of influenza-like symptoms among students. While UHS treated 900 such cases in the fall of 2009, there have been only 13 since Jan. 1.
“On the professional side, we are hoping that [H1N1] can be put on the back burner,” Rosenthal said, though he echoed Redd in advising continued vigilance and personal hygiene.
According to SteelFisher, the research group intends to continue tracking the evolution of the public’s response as the nature of the illness becomes clearer.
“It’s important to see what people think retrospectively [about the H1N1 outbreak] and what the implications are for moving forward,” SteelFisher said.

Harvard Medical School professor Nicholas A. Christakis and economics professor David I. Laibson ’88 each received a grant of about $1.5 million from the National Institute on Aging to implement research geared toward enhancing the quality of life.
The five-year Roybal Center grant from the NIA—a part of the National Institutes of Health—seeks to help society acclimatize to an aging population, according to Richard M. Suzman ’64, director of the NIA’s Division of Behavioral and Social Research, which funds the Roybal Centers. Christakis and Laibson will lead two of the four newly designated Centers.
“If you look at the world, within five years there will be more people aged 65 and over than children under five,” said Suzman, calling aging the “crowning glory” of the past century and a half. “What becomes important is that people are living longer, and the extra years of their lives must be financed somehow—so we help people save more, work longer, and be healthier.”
Laibson, whose Roybal Center is based at the National Bureau of Economic Research, said that he will utilize his grant money to focus on the influence of behavior in health. Using a combination of psychology and economics, Laibson said his objective is to encourage successful financial decision-making practices and devise new interventions to improve health outcomes.
Laibson will collaborate with Harvard Kennedy School Professor Brigitte C. Madrian, Yale School of Management Professor James J. Choi ’98, and post-doctoral fellow at the NBER John Beshears ’04. Laibson said his team’s research will work to “[bring] back grandmother’s and grandfather’s advice”—such as getting regular flu shots—to the modern age.
“We work to help people to make better choices by gently pushing them in the right direction. If they aren’t gently nudged, they procrastinate or they get confused,” Laibson said. “It could be something like saving more for retirement, enrolling in a 401K plan, diversifying your portfolio.”
In turn, Christakis’ Roybal Center for Translational Research on Aging will explore the relationship between social networks and health problems, including obesity and cancer. Christakis’ lab director Thomas Keegan said that the research is based upon the premise that knowledge alone is insufficient, and must be translated into action to yield positive change.
Keegan said that the Roybal grant’s appeal lies in its encouragement of translational research—which allows for a more comprehensive, sociological view of health issues—and its ability to directly impact people’s wellbeing.
“This opportunity also gives us a lot of freedom to look at new ideas and collaborate with others who start developing their own lines of research,” Keegan said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Cambridge Mayor E. Denise Simmons declared her candidacy for Anthony D. Galluccio’s former State Senate seat last Friday, becoming the second Cambridge City Councillor to join the ten-candidate race.
Simmons will face fellow City Councillor Marjorie C. Decker and six other Democrats in a primary on April 13, followed by a general election on May 11.
“Was I planning on running for Senate? No,” Simmons said in an interview with The Crimson yesterday. “No one could have foreseen that the Senate seat would become vacant.”
Simmons said that upon the urging of her friends, she decided to run for the seat as an “opportunity to do good.”
“I look at the terrain, and I see a winnable race,” said Simmons, who was the nation’s first openly lesbian African-American mayor.
Simmons’ campaign manager Neal Alpert has created a Facebook fan page for his boss, and he said at the time of yesterday’s interview that he hoped to unveil a campaign Web site that night and more campaign literature in the weeks to come.
But Simmons said she is most focused on face-to-face campaigning, emphasizing her desire to interact with citizens who do not know her in the further reaches of the Senate district, which includes parts of Boston, Chelsea, Everett, Revere, Saugus, and Somerville.
“There is no second place to direct voter contact,” Simmons said.
She is also planning to campaign in Cambridge, which is home to two City Councillors and a local lawyer who are among the candidates vying for the State Senate seat, according to Alpert.
“I think if it was just one person running from Cambridge, they would probably feel they have a lock on Cambridge, whereas now the candidates have to work that much harder,” Alpert said.
“Both of the [City Councillors] running are really popular in Cambridge,” Cambridge resident Eva Kirilova ’11 said. “It might be a little problematic for the citizens.”
Simmons will be competing for the seat left vacant by Galluccio, who resigned from the Senate in early January after he was sentenced to a year in jail. Galluccio had failed a series of breathalyzer tests less than three days after his probation for an October hit-and-run accident in Cambridge.
Before he joined the Mass. Senate in 2007 by special election—after Jarrett T. Barrios ’90 resigned to run a healthcare company—Galluccio served as Cambridge’s mayor from 2000 to 2001. At 32, he was the city’s youngest mayor since 1940.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At a public hearing attended by over 90 Cambridge residents last night, chicken and duck owner Blake R. Brasher appealed a denial by the Cambridge Inspectional Services Department to keep his co-owned birds in his backyard as an “accessory use” of his existing residential property.
After nearly three hours of listening to opinions from over 20 Cambridge residents, the Board voted in a four to one decision to deny the petition on the basis that maintaining five chickens and ducks on the premises of 220 Putnam Ave. does not satisfy the definition of “accessory use” as stated in the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Cambridge.
As it stands, the ordinance defines two criteria for determining “accessory use”: the “accessory” in question must be “subordinate to the principal use” of the residential property and “customarily incidental to the principal use.” While the Board agreed last night that the first stipulation had been met, it spent the majority of the hearing debating whether the second criterion had been satisfied.
Brasher, who co-owns the birds with housemates Adam W. Fastman and Allison J. Fastman, argued that the “ownership of pets, even types of pets that most people cannot imagine wanting to have, is universally accepted as customarily incidental to residential use.”
Noting that the ordinance only provided a list of “principal uses” and not “accessory uses,” the Board questioned the extent to which the ownership of chickens and ducks was “customary” in Cambridge, which became the central topic of discussion for the rest of the evening.
Brasher provided the Board with a list of cities in Massachusetts, such as Belmont and Boston, that allowed chickens on residential lots—even if some required a permit. He also argued that “hen-keeping has a long history in urban settings,” citing that people all over the world have been keeping domestic ducks and chickens in urban areas for thousands of years.
Barbara M. Bryant, a Cambridge resident and owner of three chickens, said that she was having trouble understanding why chickens appeared unappealing as pets.
“I don’t understand how chickens can be singled out and discriminated against because they are different from other pets,” Bryant said.
Julie Wormser, a resident who would like to start having chickens as pets as well, said that chickens are a part of “community glue.”
Brasher said in an interview after the hearing that he was disappointed to learn that “if something is exotic, it is illegal in Cambridge.”
“Basically what I learned today is that you can’t do something unless everybody is doing it,” he added.
City Council member Craig A. Kelley also attended the hearing last night, though he did not take sides on the issue.
“We live in such a dense area, [so] it is a challenge sometimes to balance what makes every person happy,” Kelley said.
The controversy over the ownership over the birds first arose almost a year ago, when Marica C. Hamilton called inspectional services to her neighbors’ home for legal concerns. Hamilton also complained about the noises and smells generated by the birds, and possible health ramifications.
But last night, Hamilton was among the attendees who emerged from the hearing in high spirits.
“I hope that I can enjoy my yard,” she said. “I hope we can be friendly now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 10 professors stood on stage in Sanders Theatre, like rock stars—students in the audience cheering and whistling as they were introduced. Many had faced long waits in the line that had begun snaking its way from Memorial Hall to the front of the Science Center almost two hours beforehand. Hundreds more had been turned away when the spacious hall reached capacity.
In the first annual “Harvard Thinks Big” event, spearheaded by two students with the help of three major student groups, 10 professors from various fields were brought together to speak for 10 minutes each about their areas of expertise.
Lectures discussed issues ranging from the human psyche’s evolutionary inability to process the threat of global warming, to the significance of cooking for human evolution, to the necessity for religious pluralism.
Harvard Kennedy School Lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy, who hinted that his days at Harvard might be numbered during his 10-minute presentation, discussed the future of protest—an area in which “teabaggers and terrorists and other terrible people might have gotten a head start.”
At a juncture of his speech that drew moans from the audience, the protest literature lecturer also had choice words about Harvard’s embattled former president Lawrence H. Summers.
“We need to stop worrying about the state of our endowment and start worrying more about why our former president who’s responsible for the endowment’s state is now advising the president on how to fix the financial crisis,” McCarthy said.
McCarthy ended his discussion with a petition for immediate action, to “bring about a new birth of protest.”
“We came to Harvard for the professors,” said Derek M. Flanzraich ’10, who conceived and planned the event along with Peter D. Davis ’12. “We come to talk about ideas. Everyone [tonight] can talk about what they’re passionate about.”
Flanzraich, who said the idea for the event was inspired by the series of popular lectures known as “TED Talks,” added that yesterday’s lectures, once published online, might reach the biggest audiences some of the professors had ever accessed.
Passion was a universal theme, and one that Computer Science Lecturer David J. Malan ’99 stressed in his personal story of how he changed from a Government enthusiast to a Computer Science concentrator after realizing he looked forward to the Friday nights spent coding for problem sets in his Mather House dormitory room.
Malan used the event as a platform to introduce a new Web site that will allow students to suggest ideas—particularly inefficiencies around campus—for next fall’s batch of CS50 students to address.
“If we get 1,000 students to submit ideas, then, think about it: that’s 1,000 improvements in a year,” Malan said.
Psychology Professor Daniel T. Gilbert introduced the idea of why global warming has not galvanized a stronger reaction.
Humans measure threats by intentionality, immorality, imminence, and instantaneousness, he said, explaining that global warming—a slow-moving, amoral, unintentional event—possesses none of these traits.
Other speakers at the event included Assistant Professor in English Matthew B. Kaiser, who talked about rhetoric that labeled “boyish” characteristics as overly immature.
Psychology Professor Steven A. Pinker discussed the unsubstantiated perception that humans are becoming more violent.
Professor of Biological Anthropology Richard W. Wrangham lectured on how humans’ abilities to cook signalled the evolution to the modern human.
Professor of African and African American Studies and English Glenda R. Carpio examined the social significance of hip-hop.
Lecturer on Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Andrew Berry discussed the genetic mutations responsible for biologically differentiating humans from chimpanzees.
Professor of Germanic Languages and Literatures Maria Tatar—who teaches a course on childhood literature—traced the cultural history of the Little Red Riding Hood story while speaking about the malleability of child fairy tales.
Harvard Divinity School Professor Diana L. Eck, who is also Lowell House Master, talked about religious energies and spiritual pluralism.
The event, which drew an estimated capacity crowd of over 1,166 to Sanders, was organized by the College Events Board, Harvard Undergraduate Television, and the Undergraduate Council.

The Harvard men’s volleyball team will have to wait at least another three days to get a shot at pocketing its first victory of the season after last night’s match against Rivier College was postponed due to weather.
The Crimson will now wait until Feb. 23 to travel to Nashua, N.H.
Harvard, which dropped its opening four games of the season, will look to get back on track this Saturday when it takes on Princeton at the Malkin Athletic Center at 4 p.m.
The Tigers should prove to be a formidable opponent for the Crimson, having won its two previous matchups against conference opponents.
Although Harvard has gotten off to a bumpy start, the return of co-captain Gil Weintraub in the squad’s last matchup provides reason for optimism.
Weintraub, who missed the team’s first three games due to injury, led his team with 16 points in his 2010 debut. But the senior’s effort was not enough to put Harvard on the winning track.
When the Crimson returns to the court this Saturday, Weintraub and the rest of the Harvard team will look to seal its first victory.

Harvard men’s basketball needs the Ivy League to get weird. After flopping against Princeton last weekend, the Crimson will need to win its remaining games and depend on wild outcomes in league play in order to stay in contention for the conference title.
The problem is that, so far this season, no team has embraced the role of the underdog. Week after week, the favorites win big, stomping their weaker opponents like Edward Norton in American History X.
Sure, there have been some close games. The Tigers’ win in Cambridge a week ago was certainly thrilling, as was Penn’s narrow victory over Dartmouth last Friday. But the closest game the league has to an upset is the Quakers’ last-second triumph over Brown, a win that rocked the league about as hard as an Enya concert.
For Harvard to gain ground on Cornell and Princeton, it will need the bottom-dwelling Ivies to do some damage. The Bears did a commendable job last week in scaring the Big Red. For the first time in weeks, Cornell looked mortal, trailing Brown with as few as 16 minutes remaining. If Columbia, Dartmouth, Penn, and Yale can follow the Bears’ lead, then sooner of later one or both of the league leaders will fall.
For its own part, the Crimson’s task of winning out is becoming increasingly difficult. Injuries are going around Harvard’s frontcourt like the flu in first grade.  Sophomore Andrew Van Nest is out with pneumonia, classmate Keith Wright is hobbled with Achilles tendonitis, and senior Pat Magnarelli is sidelined with a high ankle sprain. These ailments have resulted in increased action for co-captain Doug Miller, freshman Kyle Casey, and rookie Jeff Georgatos, who recorded an unprecedented “13 trillion” (13 minutes, zero stats) in the loss to Princeton.
The loss of its inside presence clearly affected the Crimson. Without a forward able to score in the post, Harvard was forced to attack from the perimeter, where it faced long streaks of cold shooting.
But just as quickly as the injury bug bit the Crimson, it can bite the Big Red or the Tigers. How vulnerable would Cornell be without Jeff Foote anchoring the paint? What would Princeton look like without Doug Davis running the point?
While Harvard’s championship hopes have taken a hit the last two weeks and are now a long shot, many games remain to be played. Anything can happen, but one thing is certain. If the Crimson is to challenge for the Ivy crown, it will take a league-wide effort.
HARVARD (15-5, 4-2 Ivy)                 at YALE (9-14, 3-3)
With only three effective forwards healthy, Harvard is very vulnerable. Yale staked its claim last week as the fourth-best team in the Ivy League with a win over the Lions. The Elis dominated Columbia on the boards, 41-26—a worrisome stat for the hobbled Crimson.
Rightly or wrongly, Jeremy Lin leads the fan voting for the Bob Cousy Award. If he is legitimately the top point guard in the country, he will need to carry Harvard during this stretch of the season. The Crimson is sure to attract a rowdy crowd at the John J. Lee Amphitheater, and I see them silencing the Yalies.
Pick: Harvard 69, Yale 63
No. 22 CORNELL (20-3, 6-0)            at PENN (3-15, 2-2)
The Big Red stumbled out of the gates against Brown, but it deserves a stinker after nearly a month of impeccable hoops. The Quakers gave a spirited effort in Cambridge, especially point guard Zack Rosen, and sit at a very respectable .500 in the conference, but they don’t have the horses to compete with Cornell.
Pick: Cornell 82, Penn 58
COLUMBIA (8-12, 2-4) at PRINCETON (13-5, 4-0)
Overlooked coming into conference play, the Tigers have won 11 of their last 12 games and surprised everyone with their start. Columbia struggled against the Big Red and Harvard to start the Ivy schedule but has recovered by winning two of its last three games. Still missing guard Patrick Foley with a separated right shoulder, the Lions rely almost exclusively on Noruwa Agho. If he is on, Columbia is capable of providing the kind of upset that Harvard needs. Against Princeton, though, I don’t see it happening.
Pick: Princeton 58, Columbia 50
DARTMOUTH (4-16, 0-6) at BROWN (7-16, 1-5)
The bottom pair of Ivy teams both could use a win. Brown has far more talent than the Big Green, including potential All-Ivy forward Matt Mullery and streaky freshman Tucker Halpern in the frontcourt. But the Bears have a head-scratching resume which features a hard-fought game against Cornell and a stunning loss to Penn. Depending on which Brown team shows up, Dartmouth might have a chance. I say the shame of last place is enough inspiration for the Bears to play well and take down the Big Green.
Pick: Brown 64, Dartmouth 55
No. 22 CORNELL at PRINCETON
This matchup is the game of the week. Cornell came into its last hyped game—against Harvard two weeks ago—with such focus that it’s hard to imagine the Big Red won’t be geared up for this game as well. The big difference this time is that the game takes place on enemy territory. Historically, Princeton’s Jadwin Gymnasium has proven to be a hostile atmosphere, but Cornell has already shown poise on bigger arenas such as Kansas’ Allen Fieldhouse. The Big Red has thrived each time it has faced a challenge, and I see the trend continuing.
Pick: Cornell 66, Princeton 56
DARTMOUTH at YALE
The road doesn’t get any easier for Dartmouth. Eventually, it will steal a win in the conference, but it’s impossible to predict against whom. Until that day comes, I’ll continue picking against the Big Green.
Pick: Yale 67, Dartmouth 58
COLUMBIA at PENN
I think Penn is better than its record and stands a good chance against a team as one-dimensional as the Lions. The Quakers have the most devoted fans in the Ivy League, and I think they will give Penn a big lift in its first home Ivy weekend of the season.
Pick: Penn 70, Columbia 67
HARVARD at BROWN
Mullery presents a huge challenge to the Crimson’s big men. The Brown forward is the most polished post player in the league, and Harvard, which couldn’t handle Cornell’s similarly-talented forward Jeff Foote, is thin on the front line. Facing the Bears on the back end of the trip, on a night after logging big minutes in New Haven, won’t make the task of stopping Mullery any easier. I’m tempted to pick Brown with an upset, but I would never forgive myself if the Crimson pulled out a win. Harvard in a squeaker.
Pick: Harvard 68, Brown 66
RECORD LAST WEEK: 6-2 (To date: 13-3)

After winning the Battle of Beantown last weekend, the Harvard men’s and women’s track and field teams look to continue their success as they take on Yale and Princeton tomorrow.
Travelling to the Tiger’s Jadwin Gymnasium for the annual HYP Meet, both squads will face two of the top teams in the league.
With wins in last Saturday’s morning events, the men claimed a decisive victory against its local rivals while the women clinched the Beantown title with a first place finish in the 4x400 relay final.
Other highlights included co-captain Jack Brady finishing first in the shot put and junior Brian Hill and co-captain Justin Grinstead’s one-two finish in the 500-meter run. On the women’s side, freshman Carlyle Davis captured the 500-meter run for the Crimson.
“I felt that both teams competed very well,” Harvard head coach Jason Saretsky said. “It was great to come away with the double win.”
But Harvard will be facing tougher competition tomorrow against the Tigers and the Bulldogs. The Princeton men finished first at the Sykes-Sabock Challenge last weekend while the Yale men topped the Crimson in this event a year ago.
“I felt very good about the meet on Saturday,” said Princeton men’s head coach Fred Samara. “I’m happy to host the meet, and it will be a lot of fun. It will be a competitive meet, but we’ve won handily in the past.”
The women’s team, which came out ahead at last year’s meet, is similarly prepared to compete against its rivals and ready for the challenge of tougher competitors.
“We’re definitely excited to compete on Saturday,” said women’s team co-captain Thea Lee. “It’s a big tradition and rivalry for us. We’re very set on defending our title.”
Yet to defeat their Ivy League rivals, both sides also know that they will have to rely on their training and improvements if they hope to pull out another double victory.
“We’ve been training consistently all through J-Term,” Lee said. “We have dedicated ourselves to working hard and it will show this weekend.”
“We’re focusing more on speed, trying to taper down into race speed, not heavy endurance workouts,” Grinstead said.
Harvard’s competition is also going to face a few challenges, especially Princeton, with a few Tigers coming back from injury.
“We’ve had a few people with injuries and we’ll be bringing some guys back this weekend,” Samara said. “We have a very talented young team. We hope to start off with the weight throw, then the shot put, and keep rolling from that point.”
It is going to be a tough matchup for all three teams though, with the win coming down to the wire. Each squad has its strengths, but there are a few events that will prove to be close-calls.
“Princeton has a very strong distance program,” Lee said. “It will be where we need to step up the most. I have full confidence in the sprints and jumps and I think the deciding factor will be the distance races.”
Lee finished second in the 800-meter run last weekend with a time of 2:13.76, her indoor personal best.
“I’m hoping to improve on that and get as many points for the team as I can,” Lee said. “Yale has a very competitive 800 runner, so I want to give her a run for her money.”
Even though they’re facing two of their toughest competitors this weekend, both the men’s and the women’s teams have high hopes that they can pull off the win and continue the success they have been seeing this year.
“We’re really looking to take down Yale,” Grinstead said. “We were able to beat Yale at Heps [Heptagonal Championships] last year. We’ve beaten Yale and like that feeling, and we have a strong chance against Princeton too.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team, coming off a fourth-place finish in the 58th Annual Beanpot Tournament, looks to rebound in home games against Rensselaer (15-12-3, 8-6-2 ECAC) tonight and against No.16 Union (15-7-6, 9-3-4 ECAC) tomorrow night.
The Crimson (6-14-3, 6-7-3 ECAC), despite its sub-.500 record in league competition, can substantially improve its chances of playing on home ice in the opening round of the conference playoffs with two wins this weekend.
“We know that these teams are pretty close in the standings around us,” sophomore forward Alex Killorn said. “If we want to make a push, these two games are huge.”
Harvard sits in eighth place, the final spot in the standings that guarantees home ice in the first round of the ECAC tournament. The team has six more league games, four of which are at home, before the start of the playoffs.
In two contests in January this year, the Crimson beat the then No.13 Dutchmen, 4-1, and tied the Engineers, 3-3. Harvard scored all three of its goals in the final period of its game versus Rensselaer, a dramatic tie which featured a last-second goal from freshman forward Louis Leblanc. Killorn also scored one of the three third period goals.
Going into the games this weekend, Union is in a three-way tie for the conference lead and the Engineers are in fifth.
Though about a quarter of league schedule remains to be played, the ECAC conference tournament is already in mind for teams and coaches in the 12 team league. “With the way our league is and how teams flip-flop from game to game we still need to have a great last six games and finish strong,” Union coach Nate Leaman said.
Of late, the Crimson’s play has been lackluster, a stark contrast to the three straight league wins that Harvard brought into its last set of games versus the Dutchmen and Rensselaer. In its last five contests, the Crimson has been outscored 20-10, with a lone victory coming against ECAC opponent Brown.
Of particular concern was the team’s inability to convert power play opportunities against Northeastern in the Beanpot consolation game.
In the first period of that contest, Harvard had a five-on-three chance for nearly a minute and a half. The Crimson managed only one shot and no goals with the two-man advantage. The other power play opportunities were fruitless as well.
The coaching staff took note of this shortcoming against the Huskies.
“We’re stressing with some of our plays some of the things...that did not work well the last times we’ve been on power,” said Harvard assistant coach Patrick Foley. “There’s a sense of urgency on our part, to correct some issues that we need to correct, and our hope is that the competitive spirit that we need to be a winning team comes out.”
Killorn noted that the Crimson had success against Brown on the power play, a game in which Harvard scored two goals when the Bears had four players on the ice.
“We know we can score on a power play, but we have to outwork their team,” Killorn said. “By watching video and working on it in practice, I think we’ll be fine for the weekend.”
The Crimson has given up 18 goals in conference play when short one player on the ice. On the other hand, Union has allowed just 10 goals on the power play this year in conference games, second fewest in the ECAC.
Despite a sound defeat on home ice in its last game against Harvard, the Dutchmen look to be tougher competition this time around. Union is coming into the weekend with two consecutive victories, including an 11-2 trouncing of Clarkson. Dutchmen forward Mario Valery-Trabucco, who is third on the team in goals and fifth in assists, had a hattrick in the game. He was shut out in the first contest against Harvard.
With three more weekends of league competition left in the regular season, Foley was reluctant to discuss the playoff picture. Instead, he looks at taking the rest of the season one game at a time.
“Our ultimate goal is to win Friday night and let the rest take care of itself.” Foley said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Now that the Harvard men’s basketball team has fallen twice in league play midway through conference schedule, the chance of the Crimson’s Jeremy Lin matching up against Kentucky’s John Wall come March have disappeared.
But while the battle between these two guards on the hardwood will have to be postponed indefinitely, Lin and Wall have been pitted against each other in another contest.
Lin, a senior from the Ivy League hoping to extend his playing career beyond his graduation, and Wall, a freshman-phenom likely to be selected first overall in this June’s NBA draft, are two of the eleven finalists for this season’s Bob Cousy Award, given to the nation’s top point guard.
Although Lin does not fit the traditional mold of a Cousy Award winner—Lin is the only player represented from the Ivy League and one of three from a team outside the BCS conferences—the 6’3 guard has received far greater fan support than any of the 10 other candidates.
As of Thursday afternoon, Lin had received 42.6% of the fan votes, placing him miles ahead of the second largest vote getter, Maryland’s Greivis Vasquez, who had received 24.2% of the vote. Wall sat at a distant third with 15.9%.
Although it looks like Lin will run away with the fan vote, which closes in March, it remains unlikely that Lin will take home the award.
The winner of the award is ultimately chosen by selection committee comprised of 30 NCAA coaches, hall of famers, and media members. Taking the award away from Wall, who leads the No. 2 team in the country in points, assists, minutes, and steals per game, should prove to be a tall task.
To Lin’s credit, the three-time Ivy League player of the week has outperformed Wall statistically, averaging more points, rebounds, blocks, and steals per game. With that being said, ultimately the lower level of competition Lin has played against should do in the Harvard co-captain.
The winner of the award will join the ranks of past winners, Ty Lawson, DJ Augustine, Acie Law IV, Dee Brown, Raymond Felton, and Jameer Nelson, each of whom was selected in the NBA Draft.

Datamatch may be the hottest thing at Harvard (except maybe your significant other) around this time of year. Using an algorithm that's now over a decade old, the service, which attracted over 600 newly registered users within less than a day of its release on Wednesday, helps matchless folk at Harvard find true love. Or so it claims.
But how do you know what love is by just answering 30 simple questions? Has it ever worked? We asked James W. Danz '12, communications manager of the Harvard Computer Society—the student organization that provides the service every year—for the inside scoop.
FlyBy: What is the goal of Datamatch?
Danz: It's not like we're actually trying to pair people up with the love of their lives—clearly we are, right? [He chuckles.] It's to create something fun for the Harvard student body, at least for a week.
FlyBy: Who writes the questions?
Danz: We [the Harvard Computer Society] rewrite them from scratch every year. Last Saturday, we got 10 of us together to try to think of funny stuff. We try to have a good balance of geeky humor, general Harvard humor, and some things that mostly relate to real relationships. We make sure the questions are funny because we want the experience of completing Datamatch to be funny.
FlyBy: Has a match ever worked?
Danz: I have one personal anecdote... [He proceeds to tell us about one girl he got matched with, and how awkward that was.] It at least has been used to generate real life hilarious awkwardness, but I don't know about real love.
FlyBy: What can you tell us about the algorithm and its ability to find love?
Danz: The algorithm is over 10 years old. It's got 10 years of experience with the Harvard student body under its belt. We have made some modifications to it throughout the years; this year we actually did decide to write something new from scratch. We're still deciding whether to use it. The old algorithm in the past has not ensured bidirectional matching. We don't want it to be unfortunate like that, so we're exploring the possibility of building pairs.
FlyBy: What are some of your favorite questions and answers?
Danz: "What part of the Harvard experience best symbolizes your love life?... Pset night: I know I'm just setting myself up to be hurt, but I still can't stop." "Your first date is going poorly. You... Get a stronger pair of binoculars." "You walk in on your significant other cheating. You... Invade Troy."
FlyBy: Do you think this questionnaire is representative of love life at Harvard?
Danz: Yes. Everybody at Harvard is rushed. The fact that we need to build it [for students] to flip through when they know they're supposed to be paying attention in lecture shows the average amount of time that the average student is willing to devote to their love life.
FlyBy: Do you have a Valentine?
Danz: Yes. She already took [the quiz] for that reason.
To find your true love, go to datamatch.hcs.harvard.edu and register. Answer the 30-question survey, and hit "Lead me to my true love." The program will work its top-secret magic and return up to 10 names of your true love matches to your e-mail inbox on Valentine's Day.

As Valentine's Day approaches, you might be thinking about how you can get that cute girl from your psych class to go on a date with you. If you're looking for a solution, just ask Professor Steven Pinker.
Pinker is happily married to philosopher and author Rebecca N. Goldstein. And in a video interview with Big Think, a Web site dedicated to spotlighting experts’ thoughts on an array of topics, Goldstein answers questions such as, “What is love?” and “What is it like when two prominent intellectuals attempt a marriage together?”
In the clip, Goldstein explains that “we all want…our lives to go well and to flourish and when you love somebody you feel that as keenly for them as for yourself and often more keenly, and that’s what...I think the feeling of love is.”
Goldstein smiles as she relates the story of how she and Pinker met. As one might expect of a Harvard professor and his wife, the two read each other's works long before meeting in person. Pinker even quoted Goldstein in his book “Words and Rules” before the two were introduced.  When she stumbled upon the quote, Goldstein says, “I thought, oh my Lord, Steven Pinker knows who I am.”
The couple formally met when a magazine wanted to arrange a conversation between a scientist and a writer. The magazine asked Pinker which author he wanted to speak with, and he chose Goldstein. The rest, as they say, is history.
When asked if thinking about love ever gets in the way of being in love itself, Goldstein says that one of the things she loves most about her husband is that in his life, love and thinking are wedded together.
Though Pinker mentions Goldstein as his wife only in the “long bio” section of his Web site, he proudly advertises Goldstein's new book, “36 Arguments for the Existence of God,” on his welcome page.
So, to those of you still fretting over your sorry love lives, take heart (and start writing some New York Times best-sellers). This marriage of the minds should show you that love and intellect do mix, and that all you need to find that someone special is some crazy hair and your own Wikipedia page. Easy, right?

Everyone knows there’s nothing better  than a secret admirer.
For those of you looking for another way to share the love this season, Mather and  Cabot HoCos are here to help. Both Houses have placed anonymous “compliment  boxes” in their dining halls for residents to send messages to each  other.
This is the second year Mather has  had a compliment box, and last year the messages helped brighten Valentine’s  Day for nearly 200 lonely Matherites.
“It’s sort of like in grade school,  whenever you used to do the thing where everyone had their own decorated  box,” Cabot HoCo Chair Molly M. Rooney ’11 said.
Rooney said that the messages are meant  to help build community within Cabot.
“It’s good to be able to express your feelings for someone in a semi-formal type of way,” she said,  “If love was there, that’d be cool too.”
The messages will be delivered on Sunday,  so take a few minutes to keep the love alive this weekend.
“We just do whatever we can to facilitate  matchmaking on Valentine’s Day,” Mather HoCo Chair Ankur N. Argawal  ’11 said.
