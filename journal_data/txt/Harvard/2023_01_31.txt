“When you read this book, you will eat my life.”
“Gran Cocina Latina” is chef, historian, and author Maricel E. Presilla's magnum opus. Guiding her readers through 20 Latin American countries and hundreds of restaurants, chefs, home-cooks, vendors, and markets, Presilla presents over 500 recipes that encapsulate the flavors and techniques of Latin American cuisine. As chef and owner of restaurants Cucharamama, Zafra, and Ultramarinos in New Jersey, Presilla has kept a foot in the culinary world while also publishing four preceding collections of histories, lifestyles, and recipes of the Caribbean. Winner of the James Beard Awards for Cookbook of the Year and International Cooking, “Gran Cocina Latina” is a testament to Presilla’s comprehensive collection of Latin American food, history, and life through cuisine.
Presilla’s recipes are direct as she’s able to meet readers of varying levels of expertise in Latin American gastronomy. She guides readers through recipes as fundamental as preparing rice while highlighting its deceptive simplicity. Whether to prepare it as fluffy and al dente (like in Colombia), with raspa or cucayo crust (from Cuba and Colombia), or without a gummy texture (disapprovingly called api in Ecuador), the simple rice is as variable as the regions that use it.
The winner of the James Beard Award for Best Chef Mid-Atlantic Region in 2012 also demonstrates her culinary prowess as she distills some of Latin America’s most complex recipes into page-long summaries. She steers the complex world of Mexican moles, walks curious readers through fermenting Chilean chicha beer or Costa Rican vino de flor de Jamaica (or hibiscus wine), and dissects the infamously difficult dessert flan into digestible steps. The ingredients and measurements are explicitly clear, and her directions are elegantly concise as they maintain a consistent syntactical flow throughout the book.
Presilla’s mix of literary style in “Gran Cocina” is as much a memoir of her life in Cuba and travels through Latin America as it is an informative cookbook. In the introduction to the collection, Presilla confesses, “Writing this book is a way of acknowledging my expanding personal identity and the way I cook now.” She explores the complicated identity that Latin Americans within the United States have — a duality of simultaneously holding two identities of being American and also Latin American that is only recognized within the U.S. As a Cuban immigrant, she became obsessed with piecing together the “seductive smells and flavors of a living, boiling cooking pot, its hidden potential to reveal the past, present, and future.” Yet, Presilla’s mission is to uncover the unifying features of Latin American cooking and the underlying unifying pieces, and honor the distinctions between respective cultures’ traditional ingredients and methods of cooking.
“Gran Cocina Latina” is a testament to food’s power to ground readers in culture and make connections across continents by sharing a meal at a dinner table. Presilla “honors her very personal account of how Latin American food became a core of my existence,” and navigates readers through a complex historical and geographical understanding of the unity and uniqueness of Latin cuisine.
“Two inspirations lie at the heart of this book,” Priscilla explains: “To celebrate the wonderful present moment of mixing that is creating a Latin American identity without boundaries in the United States, and to search diligently for what can be preserved of traditional and sometimes even ancient practices […] My aim is to adapt and transform the elemental beauty and tastes of Latin American cooking to the modern kitchen while respecting the food’s primary flavors, and to create earthy, intensely flavored dishes that keep you reaching for more.”
As a trained cultural anthropologist and holder of a PhD in Spanish Medieval History from New York University, Presilla’s vast knowledge and academic research shines through her ethnographic narrative. After leaving Cuba in 1970, Presilla found curiosity in “understanding how Arabs, Jews, and Christians each contributed to the development of the Spanish character, culture, and cuisine.” As her research became rooted in the liminality of the Latin American identity in the United States, Presilla “began to see what had made Latin America the world’s first and greatest laboratory of intercontinental culinary ‘fusion’.” Through “Gran Cocina Latina,” Presilla offers an encyclopedic collection of flavors, ingredients, and cooking methods. Her short glossary on the uses of a variety of peppers analyzes the evolution of Old and New World spices and she intentionally catalogs the array of cooking tools that populate traditional Latin kitchens. Her recipes thoughtfully combine the origins of the dish — like her highlighting the Mayan significance of cohinita pibil — with her own experience tasting and learning about the recipes she presents.
Interwoven throughout the book are brilliant visuals. Photography couple Gentl and Hyers honor Presilla’s dishes in Vermeer-style portraiture. The photographs are clear, natural, and elegantly complex, featuring creative uses of light and color, since many of Presilla’s dishes are accompanied by detailed illustrations. Presilla’s diction provides an additional element of visualization as she provides vignettes about the dishes she shares. Her segment “Latin American Thanksgiving,” transports readers to dinner with her family during her first Thanksgiving in the U.S., and her recipe for “Salt Cod Season” demonstrates the communal melancholy and exuberance of Holy Week.
As a piece of personal narrative, continental memory, and almanac of ingredients and techniques, the size and depth of “Gran Cocina Latina” makes it a dense and thorough collection of experience. However, this volume of information may prove to be difficult for readers to engage with. Though the recipes are thorough and vast, simply skipping through the pages to find what to make for dinner loses sight of the text’s significance. Yet, its 900 page depth is a daunting choice for a casual read.
Instead, “Gran Cocina” is a book you return to throughout your lifetime, a staple for any kitchen, and a sentimental tribute to Latine cultural identity. If you’re looking for a simple cookbook with straightforward recipes, this may not be the read for you. But if you’d like to understand the Latin American food scene and the origins of some of the most well-known global flavors, this book can become a lighthouse.

Karen Chee ’17 is a comedic “big dog” — or at least that’s what her coworkers call her. But what did she do to earn such a noble title?
“Oh I gave myself that nickname,” said Chee in an interview with The Harvard Crimson. “They had written my phone number down incorrectly on a contact sheet at work so when I went to correct it, I asked them to please also write my name as Karen ‘Big Dog’ Chee.”
Now, when Chee goes to work as a writer at “Late Night with Seth Meyers,” her coworkers refer to her as “Big Dog,” though anyone who has spent any time talking to kind and mild-mannered Chee knows this intimidating name to be inapt. She describes herself as “a bit of a square,” recalling a daily to-do list that consisted solely of making chocolate chip pancakes, finishing a book, and doing a puzzle. Regardless, the name has stuck with the “Late Night” staff. Chee’s default Zoom username is now a perfectly imperfect description: “Big Dog (she/her/hers).”
Chee — former Quincy House resident, dedicated alum of the Harvard comedy scene, and one of the Harvard Class of 2017's Fifteen Most Interesting Seniors — now works on a variety of projects as a comedian, writer, and actor. Besides writing for “Late Night with Seth Meyers,” she is also developing a movie, writing for the TV series “Pachinko,” and working on a book along with other assorted projects while regularly performing stand-up comedy in New York.
When asked about her experience working for Seth Meyers — a man with a demeanor that she compares to “that friendly neighborhood dad who coaches the local soccer team” — Chee smiled. “It’s great. Genuinely I am a big Seth Meyers fan outside of work,” said Chee. “But I don't need to say that, we don't want his ego to explode,” she added after a moment of reflection.
Beyond writing for “Late Night,” Chee also has her own recurring segment on the show entitled “What Does Karen Know?” Created by fellow writer Matt Goldich, the segment pokes fun at Chee’s young age, as she joined the writing team at only 23 years old.
“I’d write a joke about SpongeBob or Neopets and everybody at work would say ‘Karen, no one will get this, it sounds like a lie,’” said Chee, shaking her head. “That shocked me to my core.” In her new non-scripted segment, Meyers presents Chee with a variety of iconic cultural touchstones from his generation, and she attempts — often unsuccessfully — to guess what each of them are from her millennial frame of reference.
“The segment was really nerve wracking for me because I had to hopefully be funny enough without getting to prepare in any way,” said Chee, recalling her first time on air for the live segment. “But then once I was up there I realized I'm just with Seth, who is one of the funniest people in the world, and it just felt like hanging out. While also being filmed.”
Despite being significantly younger than many of her fellow writers, Chee expressed a thoughtful appreciation for the support she received when she joined the “Late Night” staff, especially as a young woman of color.
“There’s a generation or two above me that genuinely felt really uncomfortable when they first joined the comedy scene so now when they see somebody like me looking very lost, they're like, ‘we're gonna be there for Karen!’” said Chee, grinning.
In her time at Harvard, Chee was her own force of inclusivity in the comedy scene, taking part in the Immediate Gratification Players improv group, Satire V humor publication, and On Harvard Time comedy news show.
“The comedy community when I got to Harvard was extremely white,” said Chee. Despite befriending a diverse group of people, Chee couldn’t shake the feeling that the school was “built for wealthy white boys to have a good time.” However, this sentiment didn’t stop her from uplifting other people of color, all while still pursuing her passion for comedy.
“My friend and I put on a show where we tried to get every comedian who wasn’t a straight white dude to perform,” Chee said.“That was a really nice moment, just knowing that there were a lot of us. And we were all in the same room laughing together.”
Slowly Chee grew comfortable in Harvard spaces, even ones “where all the paintings were white people, and in the very old libraries that didn't have women's bathrooms on the floor,” she recalled. By the time Chee graduated, she left behind a more empowered Harvard comedy scene in her wake.
“It kind of felt like I defeated the final boss of white people,” said Chee, smiling.
Since graduation, Chee has continued developing her craft, attributing her comedic voice to a variety of inspirations — from her own mother and grandfather to British comedian Bob Mortimer, and even DW from PBS’s ‘Arthur,’ who she called her personal idol.
The result of this wholesome blend of comedic influences is Chee’s uniquely positive voice. Although she used to write a lot of political satire, Chee has recently settled into a particular brand of silliness she referred to as “Gooftown, U.S.A.”
“I just want to be a big goofball and say funny, silly, random things,” said Chee. “Things that aren't coming from a place of weight, just a place of lightness.”
Chee wielded this type of lighthearted comedy during the pandemic as well. While she was quarantined in Korea with family, her grandmother had to spend some time in the hospital.
“I remember thinking very clearly: ‘My job right now in Korea is Morale Team Captain,’” said Chee, recalling how she tried to be “gently funny” throughout that time. “Once Grandma and I were so giggly that the nurses came in and asked us what was going on because we sounded like we were having so much fun!”
Karen “Big Dog” Chee has cracked the code on combining comedy with kindness, making people smile by prioritizing the silly parts of life. For that, she’s certainly lived up to her noble title.

Nestled in Chelsea, Massachusetts in a lot previously used for the filming of movies, sat Space Adventure — a unique and immersive exhibition celebrating the arrival of the Man on the Moon. The exhibit consisted of a space travel simulator and a NASA merch shop.
The excursion began with a welcome from a presenter dressed in a space suit, who then led guests down a lit-up pathway to a room, where a four-minute clip played. The compilation told the story of man’s first venture into space, and was fittingly set to Elton John's iconic song “Rocket Man.” The telegenic presentation set a mood of amazement, wonder, and nostalgia.
After the presentation concluded, the audience moved into a large gallery with glass cases of authentic space suits around the walls, plaques highlighting key moments throughout the history of space exploration, and recognitions of various individuals, scientific and political, who made the journeys possible. Guests were able to engage interactively with an alcove full of coloring books for kids, a space-flight simulator, a virtual reality station, and a gift shop with all space-adjacent items one could imagine.
Leo Robinson, the longest-serving city councilmember in Chelsea who was involved in coordinating the event, spoke proudly of the scientific potential this display offers the community. “This is huge. We are in a space where 23 movies were filmed (including, but not limited to; “Equalizer,” “Gone Baby Gone,” and “Ted”), and this is the first science exhibit,” he said.
David A. Rosenfeld, a promoter and producer with Primo Entertainment, shared the logistics that went into coordinating the exhibit. Some of the exhibits were brought all the way from Brazil; others had to be loaned from NASA. Rosenfeld also pointed to the delicate nature with which those memorabilia had to be handled. “We licensed from a museum, which licenses with NASA, so as you can see in the main room where all the artifacts are, there are secure cases, locks, and we have security and cameras 24/7, and the way we transport and handle them is also very particular,” he said.
A lot of thought and care went into the spatial design of the exhibit. “There are several ton rockets hanging from the ceiling, so we needed specific permits to make sure the ceiling could hold them,” Rosenfeld said. These logistical hurdles, however, did not detract from the success of the exhibition. “What’s different about us is that we’re not really an immersive exhibit — which have really taken off over the pandemic — there are immersive areas, but we also have over 300 original NASA items that went to the moon, and have been in space,” Rosenfeld said. “So it’s a museum mixed with interactive and immersive spaces.”
Joseph H. Fuchs, an attendee at the exhibition echoed the excitement and sentiments of the creators. “This is the first exhibit of this nature that I’m attending. And it’s amazing. I lived through the first launches, since I'm 80 years old, and it’s just amazing to see the actual shoes and helmets they wore, the moon dust on their boots and rockets. It’s an unbelievable display and I’m so excited that it’s in our city.”
Overall, the experience was family-friendly, and offered many ways for attendees to interact with space-themed paraphernalia. From canned cherries that have been to space to an actual astronaut’s suit, the interactive and immersive exhibition had much to offer to the community.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Most of us don’t remember what it was like being nine years old. But not Javier Zamora: when he was nine years old, his life changed forever. In his debut memoir “Solito,” Zamora recounts the two harrowing months of his childhood he spent migrating alone from his family home in El Salvador to California in the heat of early summer.
For a memoir, the book encompasses little of Zamora’s life, focusing intently on the life he left behind in El Salvador — as a precocious student with a loving, quirky extended family — and Zamora’s odyssey to reunite with his parents, already living in the United States. Zamora’s love for his family, and the de facto family he joins along his route, is the beating heart of his story. Though the nature of a memoir is the life account of one person, Zamora gracefully and gratefully depicts all of the adults who raised him, aided him, and guided him throughout his treacherous, unforgiving journey.
At times “Solito” is difficult to read. Young Zamora faces down soldiers and border patrol, punishing desert treks, and encounters with unsympathetic individuals. The terrible beauty of the child’s perspective is his utter dependence on the kindness and care of others. As Zamora narrates the hardships he survived, the reader is left to grapple with the enormity of his situation and its apparent hopelessness; Zamora is just a kid, alone. Solito. And yet this is a story of immense hope. Zamora never loses faith that he will see his family again, and his trust in the good people around him leads to heartfelt moments of joy despite the terror and exhaustion surrounding his journey.
It is this focus on humanity and moments of quiet that sets Zamora’s story apart from other narratives of migration, though pigeon-holing this memoir as such feels reductive. While the focus of the memoir is Zamora’s journey to the United States, his attention to culture gives the book a powerful multi-national interest. Peppered through with Spanish phrases, “Solito” is a true bilingual text. Zamora attends to the subtleties between the slang and accent of El Salvador and that of Guatemala or Mexico. He explains, with childlike wonder, the experience of comparing Mexican food to his home country’s, and what it was like to share transport with migrants from across South and Central America. In doing so, Zamora calls attention to the differences between the frequent monolith “migrants,” humanizing and individualizing the people he encounters.
Zamora is best known for his poetry, which shows in his gorgeous descriptions of nature, borne at least in part, from childlike wonder and attention to detail. The audiobook, narrated by Zamora himself, at times takes on the lilt of spoken word, a feature that makes the story more immersive and heart-wrenching. For those who don’t speak Spanish, the audiobook offers an opportunity to glean intent from tone and inflection rather than pausing to translate. Zamora’s English writing often adopts Spanish grammar in a hugely successful formal choice that emphasizes the link between language and identity. Again, listening to the audiobook can help make this stylistic quirk mesh with the narrative flow more naturally.
The only challenge of this incredibly powerful story is repetition. Zamora attempts to cross the U.S./Mexico border several times, all of which are recounted in this book. It is factual recollection, and therefore not an issue that can necessarily be corrected, but the descriptions become unfortunately repetitive. Additionally, the level of detail is astonishing for a traumatic story from two months of Zamora’s early childhood that he admits to blocking out of his memory for quite some time. It seems likely that Zamora has taken liberties with retelling his story, which offers an opportunity to explain those choices that Zamora neglects.
The final note from present-day Zamora is what really sells this book as original and important. In it, he explains his rationale for writing this book, humanizing the narrative and contextualizing it within a sort of repatriation framework that sets this apart from other immigrant narratives. In many ways, “Solito” is the exact opposite of “American Dirt,” a highly controversial fictionalized account of the immigrant experience often ridiculed as “trauma porn.”
“Solito” is heartfelt and human, poetic and gripping, and as it is a true account, perfectly realistic. However, both “American Dirt” and “Solito” ask us to feel empathy for the horrors of the migrant experience in a plea for systematic change. But as more and more of these powerful stories become mainstream media, and the sensationalism of social media capitalizes on personal narratives to a numbing effect, we’re left to wonder: Is empathy enough?

Syracuse rapper Stove God Cooks is one of the most distinctive and exciting artists to emerge from the Northeast hip-hop underground in decades. Cooks’s calling card is his melodic approach to boom-bap, combining ’90s-style with sonic elements from gospel and soul. First entering the scene around 2015 as a rookie protégé of Busta Rhymes, Cooks spent several years developing his chops with the East Flatbush legend. Cooks’s 2020 debut album “Reasonable Drought” — which was produced by New York City-based rapper-producer Roc Marciano — caught the ear of Griselda Records president Westside Gunn and established the Syracuse rapper as a notable up-and-comer.
Now a signee with GxFR/Babygrande Records, Cooks has matured into the rap equivalent of a veteran five-tool player; appearing on nearly every 2022 release from the Buffalo-based Griselda camp to provide sung melodies, spoken hooks, and guest rap verses.
“We push each other. I'm rapping with the most elite in this shit right now,” Cooks said in a phone interview with The Harvard Crimson. “Just to be included in the conversation and that I can stay afloat with some of the best doing it, I'm good with that.”
With his forthcoming debut album under Griselda scheduled to release this year, Cooks is poised to push his singular hard-edged style further into the mainstream of modern rap.
“It’s curated by Westside Gunn,” Cooks said. “We're gonna give you another classic. We’re gonna keep pushing the culture forward. I’m going to keep talking the shit I talk and giving the fans these melodies.”
“This one is gonna be like ‘Reasonable Drought’ on steroids,” the rapper added.
In Syracuse, Cooks grew up surrounded by music. He spent his youth in his grandfather’s church and taught gospel choir music by his mother. His older brother showed him how to rap and educated him on Golden Era hip-hop titans like Nas, AZ, the late Half A Mill, and the late Big Pun. As Cooks got older, the rapper found himself gravitating towards artists like Puff Daddy and The LOX.
“For me The LOX, Mase, Big, were all really lyrical,” the rapper said. “How Puff was doing it then was exactly what I came from: gospel mixed with the streets.”
A young Stove God Cooks had dreams of becoming a star like his Golden Era heroes. However, he faced the disadvantage of coming from Syracuse, a place that is not particularly known for its music.
“There was no one to look up to and say, ‘Oh, yeah, we can do that.’ It's not like being outside in Brooklyn, like, ‘Oh ya, Biggie from here. HOV from here.’ There was nothing like that in Syracuse.”
In 2015, the rapper garnered his first major recognition outside of his hometown. Busta Rhymes offered to sign the Syracuse artist after hearing some of Cooks’s music on Twitter. It was actually Busta’s close friend and collaborator Lord Jamar that had initially found Stove God Cooks online.
“My people were telling me, ‘You need to put [songs] on Twitter. I've never been an internet or social media person. It was really them pushing me like, ‘Put this shit on there and the right person might hear it.’”
Beginning in 2015, Cooks locked in with Busta Rhymes, absorbing the Flatbush legend’s creative process and learning about the business side of the music industry.
“Buss is a fucking genius,” Cooks said. “I’m talking every night for like three years from 7 p.m. to 4 a.m. Every night. Buss don't take days off. To be in the game for that long and still be that dedicated just blew my fucking mind.”
It was through his mentor Busta Rhymes that Cooks was introduced to one of his closest collaborators, legendary NYC rapper-producer Roc Marciano. Marciano had also begun his career with Busta Rhymes, first joining Busta’s Flipmode Squad back in 2000. Cooks first became acquainted with Marciano after the rapper-producer respectfully declined to contribute vocals to a Flipmode reunion album that Busta was organizing. According to Cooks, Marciano made the decision in order to stay true to the new sound he had pioneered since stepping away from Flipmode.
“I understood it, honestly,” Cooks said. “I understood that he kept his sound raw while everybody gave up on it. While everybody chased the South. While everybody chased Houston. Whatever they was chasing, he stayed true to that real New York sound.”
Around 2019, Cooks felt like he still had something to prove to his peers and him and Marciano bonded over that. They quietly began work on a collaborative album that would become “Reasonable Drought.”
“I knew if I brought them into my world. I knew they would understand. If they could live with it, I knew it was over. He knew if he got the right person to get on his beats. He could prove what he wanted to prove with his production.”
Released in March 2020, the album also marked the debut of the Stove God Cooks name, a decision that, according to the Syracuse rapper, came about as a result of his personal satisfaction with the music.
“Once the project started coming together, it just felt like this was me for real. Like I said, ‘If I bring them into my world, it’s over.’ I'm really gonna bring you into the kitchen and this shit gonna feel like a conversation with me and my n****s while we cooking. And I’m God. The God of the Stove.”
With “Reasonable Drought,” Cooks and Marciano delivered on their goal. Blogs, fellow rappers, and industry executives alike quickly identified “Reasonable Drought” as one of the best rap LPs of 2020. The buzz from the project led Westside Gunn to contact Cooks directly.
“West reached out to me for “Awesome God.” These were his exact words: ‘I got three joints. You got a classic album, but nobody knows. You do these three joints and they're gonna go back to your album and give it the respect it deserves.’”
Since his three song guest appearance on Gunn’s July 2020 album “Flygod is an Awesome God 2,” Cooks has recorded over 20 guest verses for numerous Griselda and Griselda-affiliated releases. In the process, he has become one of the most highly sought-after feature artists in the game. Cooks features prominently on Gunn’s highly-anticipated album “10,” released in October 2022. The project’s eighth track “Science Class” hears the Syracuse rapper match wits with a guestlist including Busta Rhymes, Raekwon, and Ghostface Killah.
Yet despite all his success, Cooks remains humble, sharing that he does not think of himself as being famous. Last November, the Syracuse rapper attended a Celtics game with Westside Gunn and Ramon ‘1000WORD$’ Lazo, eliciting cheers from players and fans alike. Such a greeting made Cooks feel like he has officially made it as an artist.
“There’s only been a handful of moments where I felt like a real rapper. That was one of them,” Cooks said.

Rollicking and surprisingly moving, “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” eschews the idea that animation is for children and offers a sincere ode to living mindfully that will resonate with audiences of all ages. The latest installment in DreamWorks Animation’s long-running “Shrek” franchise smartly surrounds its titular hero with his own all-star ensemble, mature themes, and epic set-pieces. Brought to life with a vivid, painted animation style similar to recent films like “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse”(2018), the film soars in establishing its own fairytale aesthetic. Looking like a fable itself, the animation emphasizes the story’s core message; with Puss down to the last of his nine lives, he must learn to live in the present without fear.
While this theme may seem surprisingly heavy, it never bogs down the film’s short runtime. Opening with a bombastic celebration of Puss at his very best — throwing parties, redistributing wealth, and rescuing villagers — viewers find a hero basking in his own mythological status.
“Who is your favorite fearless hero?” Puss sings. “You are! You are!” the villagers respond. As the eponymous hero prances and dances his way through the first bit of action, the audience is invited to revel alongside him. This showmanship costs Puss his eighth life, while a run-in with the terrifying wolf, Lobo, moments later leaves him fearfully clutching onto his ninth, and final, life.
Afraid of both dying and failing to live up to his legend, Puss retreats to a cat retirement home, a sequence that drags down the otherwise energetic plot. The creative team, however, uses this time to introduce crucial side characters, including Perrito, an optimistic and entertaining sidekick, and Goldilocks and the Three Bears, a crime family searching for the mythical wishing star. Inspired to use the star’s wishing power to restore his lost lives, Puss seems nearly back to his normal self. After a daring escape from the evil magic collector Jack Horner, Puss unintentionally reunites with Perrito and Kitty Softpaws. A lesser script would feel overstuffed with all of these characters, but “The Last Wish” uses their flaws to reflect Puss’s.
Each character’s desires are perverted by the dynamic terrain protecting the elusive wishing star itself. It physically manifests each character’s internal struggle, creating a visual treat that spotlights the movie’s deeper themes. The tension between appreciating life as it is — like Perrito’s endlessly sunny outlook — and wishing for something more — like Goldilocks’s desire for a human family and Jack Horner’s for control — inform Puss’s own conflict. He wishes to abandon the mortality of his final life and return to the invincibility of having nine lives and the adoration that comes with it. The legend of Puss in Boots overshadows Puss himself, keeping him from expressing his feelings or relying on others.
Nowhere does this issue seem more relevant than in Puss and Kitty’s relationship. A flashback reveals Puss left Kitty at the altar on their wedding to continue his heroic escapades unencumbered. This fraught romantic relationship adds necessary complexity to Puss’s character and legend. Despite her introduction in the 2011 “Puss in Boots,” Kitty’s inclusion remains enjoyable and accessible, as this movie fleshes out their dynamic in sarcastic banter and one-upmanship. Underneath it all remains the potential that the two might reconcile or betray one another to secure the power of the wishing star. With Perrito’s help, however, they open up to one another and appreciate the time they get to spend together.
Lobo looms over Puss’s entire journey — the wolf, after all, is “Death. Straight up.” Sinister and seemingly omnipresent, his scenes are the most compelling in the movie. An apparently unstoppable force, Lobo is the only villain who truly forces Puss to face his fears. Having seen Puss handily dispatch any threat, Lobo’s first fight with Puss creates a legitimate threat as he quickly disarms the cat and becomes the first character to make the hero bleed. Because of this encounter, Lobo’s arrival in any other, portended by his iconic whistle, is enough to send Puss spiraling into a panic — one of the most considerate portrayals of an anxiety attack ever put to screen. As Puss realizes the value of the life he has left and the selfishness of his wish, he discovers the courage to face Lobo, a commendable resolution to his character arc.
Although the story may be predictable, it remains enjoyable for audiences of all ages. Also effective is the narrative’s presentation. Leaning away from realism, the film’s stylized aesthetic reflects the fairytale nature of Puss’s larger-than-life legend and lends visual flair to even the simplest scenes. Small flourishes and details elevate this movie above other animated features, including reduced frame rates in fights and visual emphases around Puss’s tap-dancing feet. Animation liberates the action, inviting dynamic camera angles and exaggerated movements impossible in any other medium.
Despite this exaggeration, the voice actors ground their characters’ struggles well. Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek reprise their roles as Puss and Kitty, clearly reigniting the chemistry of their will-they-won’t-they relationship. Their ability to slip between Spanish and English animates the dexterous script’s fun mashups, like Puss’s “Say hello to my gatito blade.” Wagner Moura’s Lobo is again a highlight. The actor employs an oddly weighted phrasing to accentuate his otherworldly and menacing presence. Every other member of the cast is stellar as well, guaranteeing each scene is a visual delight.
Almost every aspect of “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” emphasizes the titular character’s struggle to value his mortality. The compelling vocal performances, evocative animation, and compelling script unite to create a movie that imparts a meaningful and accessible message for viewers of all ages. Not content with simply replicating their previous animation efforts, Dreamworks imbues Puss’s narrative journey with a style completely unique to the feisty feline. Here’s to wishing for more like “The Last Wish.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Impressive productions are Harvard College Opera’s bread and butter. In the past decade, the group has successfully brought the likes of Mozart’s “Die Zauberflöte” and Jules Massenet’s “Cendrillon” to the stage. But despite the strong contenders, this year’s production of Franz Lehár’s “The Merry Widow,” running through Feb. 5 at the Agassiz Theater, might be the most special still.
The fact that the group advertises “The Merry Widow” as such — and not under its German title, “Die lustige Witwe” — is already telling, a sign of the fact that the operetta is sung in translation. The bold creative decision was hardly accidental: It was done with the goal of making this year’s production, coinciding with the group’s 30th anniversary, as accessible as possible.
“We wanted to keep in mind that this was HCO’s 30th anniversary year,” said Olympia M. A. Hatzilambrou ’23-’24, the production’s stage director. “We wanted a show that was going to be really fun and a big party, and was going to get people really excited about working on it.”
And “The Merry Widow” proves just that: An operetta thoroughly accessible not just to anyone thinking of getting involved in staging it, but also to the Harvard audience in general — in large part due to its appealing story.
In the performance, Hanna Glawari (Sophie M. Choate ’22-’23), a rich widow from the fictional Balkan principality of Ponteverde has moved to Paris and hopes to remarry. But if she were to do so, her fortune would pass into French hands, bringing the country to financial ruin. Only the Ponteverdian diplomat and Hanna’s former fiancé, Count Danilo Danilovitsch (James P. Rose ’22-’23) can save the principality by winning her over.
“It's just a great show about a lot of the ridiculousness of elite societies … dishonesty and disingenuousness between married couples, and people sort of lusting after this woman who has a lot of money,” said producer Lucas J. Walsh ’24.
“Don't take the plot too seriously. It's mostly about having a good time and [about] romance,” said cast member Eliza R. Zangerl-Salter ’26.
According to Dora Woodruff ’24, the same holds true for what is arguably the operetta’s key selling point: the music.
“There's some music in operas that's kind of hard to listen to. You have to put intellectual energy into unpacking it. And this music, you know, it's not simple — I don't want to condescend to it — but it's very beautiful. It's like the kind of music that can get stuck in your head,” Woodruff said.
But despite the seeming simplicity, the music posed some challenges. “The Merry Widow” premiered in 1905, thus putting it firmly within the public domain. But Franz Lehár had not composed an overture for the operetta until 1940, making that part of the score copyrighted. Unfortunately, the Harvard College Opera did not manage to secure the rights for that segment of the original composition. But Benjamin T. Rossen ’23, the production’s music director, stepped up and composed an original piece.
“This is a totally new composition for this opera. So it's been really exciting being a part of playing it,” Woodruff said.
Perhaps unsurprisingly for a production featuring dozens involved and more than 25 in the orchestra itself, there are more moving pieces than just the music.
“All of the artistic disciplines figured very prominently in the show,” Hatzilambrou said.
But perhaps the most notable is the role of dance, as the “The Merry Widow” is one of the operas where choreography plays a significant narrative role.
“The dancing really progresses the story and the dancing characters are extremely important to the plot,” Hatzilambrou said. “My musical favorite moments are the dances.”
For Hatzilambrou, the answer came easily. But between the music, choreography, and singing, the audiences might have a hard time deciding what their favorite parts were.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Throughout his career, director Damien Chazelle ’07 has distinguished himself as an adept chronicler of the creative process, weaving intricate portraits of artistic projects great and small. His breakout second feature, “Whiplash,” tracked a young drummer’s feverish obsession with his craft with heart-stopping urgency, bringing basement practice sessions and bombastic performances to life onscreen. Chazelle later won an Oscar for his next film “La La Land,” which told the story of two young performers struggling to make it in Hollywood’s cutthroat film and music industries, painting the city and its creative cultures in vibrant detail. Chazelle has spent the last several years unraveling a new epic of artistic discovery with his fourth film, “Babylon,” released in December 2022.
Years before he became the youngest person to win the Academy Award for Best Director, Chazelle was living in Currier House at Harvard College, alongside his friend and artistic collaborator Justin Hurwitz ’08, who has composed the scores for all of his films. The two have most recently collaborated on “Babylon,” a sprawling tragicomedy about the end of Hollywood’s silent era.
The Harvard Crimson interviewed Damien Chazelle ahead of the release of “Babylon,” discussing his inspiration for the story as well as his experience studying film at Harvard.
In both “Whiplash” and “La La Land,” Chazelle explored the lives of artists and the difficult, often unforgiving industries they navigate. Chazelle has never shied away from showcasing the harsh realities of the music or film industries; from the abuse jazz drummer Andrew endures from his teacher in “Whiplash,” to the constant rejection faced by aspiring actress Mia in “La La Land.” “Babylon,” however, exposes an even grittier, darker, dirtier side of Hollywood; a wide cast of characters gets caught up in the corruption and excess of the 1920s and ’30s, including silent era star Jack Conrad (Brad Pitt), rising star Nellie LaRoy (Margot Robbie), jazz trumpeter Sidney Palmer (Jovan Adepo), and assistant-turned-studio exec Manny Torres (Diego Calva).
Chazelle, who also wrote the script for “Babylon,” discussed his vision for the film; he spoke of the dissonance between the art of filmmaking and the industry that surrounds it.
“Whereas ‘La La Land,’ for instance, was almost purely an affectionate love letter, here I wanted to put a spotlight on the more sordid qualities of Hollywood and Hollywood history, and the darker underbelly that Hollywood is often adept at sweeping under the rug,” he said.
The story that unfolds in “Babylon” revels and reels at the drug-fueled, sex-saturated chaos of early Hollywood, showing how newcomers Nellie and Manny are inducted into the wild parties and dysfunctional showbiz scene of early twentieth-century Los Angeles. In this world, movie sets aren’t scenes of serene collaboration — instead they are barely workable, bogged down by logistical nightmares, drunken actors, manipulative businessmen, and the rapidly-changing demands of the film ecosystem. However, Chazelle didn’t want to focus solely on the depravity of Hollywood — he also worked to highlight the duality of the industry.
“If you’re trying to tell a panoramic story, a big story about Hollywood and its origins, you kind of have to include both high and low, beautiful and ugly. Because I think [what] makes Hollywood so fascinating is that the two coexist, sometimes even in the same frame,” he said. “You know, to only condemn Hollywood, or only celebrate it, I think, is to miss a big part of the picture.”
In ambitious, gripping, and sensory-rich sequences, Chazelle illustrates how movie magic arises from the ashes of chaotic productions. In one standout scene, Manny gets his first on-set gig assisting Jack on the set of a giant war epic, where the hectic dysfunction of the set makes it seem like the day will end in disaster — until, at the last moment, Manny salvages the shoot, enabling a cinematic marvel that belies the behind-the-scenes drama.
“There’s a mercilessness to it, but there’s also of course this tremendous beauty to it as well, and, to the work that Hollywood has created, and to my mind the entire lineage of Hollywood history,” Chazelle said.
Chazelle’s vision of early Hollywood unfolds on the backdrop of an almost-unrecognizable Los Angeles, as its characters navigate the scattered sprawl of mountain top mansions, ramshackle sets, and underground parties that popped up long before Los Angeles grew into a bustling city. With this portrait of early Los Angeles and its rapidly-expanding footprint, Chazelle tackles a different side of the city’s legacy than he illustrated in “La La Land,” but continues his exploration of the city’s relationship to the industry it has become synonymous with.
“I think there’s something in the DNA of L.A. that’s inextricable from the movies,” Chazelle said. “The movies themselves were this unprecedented industry, no one had seen anything quite like it, like this sort of technology parade and art form … where people would just flood in from all over the country, like moths to the flame, trying to be part of this thing. It was like a circus on a bigger scale than had ever been seen before,” Chazelle said.
Like his earlier work, the film portrays Los Angeles as a city of dreamers, although ambition manifests in different kinds of behavior in this film. “The idea of that kind of a dream factory driving the growth of a city, it attracts a certain kind of person, it attracts a certain kind of behavior. I think a lot of that helps explain the particular kind of hysteria and madness, intensity, extreme living, so to speak, that characterized Hollywood and Los Angeles at that time,” he explained.
When asked which old Hollywood movies served as inspiration for “Babylon,” Chazelle immediately mentioned “Singin’ in the Rain,” the classic 1952 Technicolor musical that tells the story of a silent era actress who struggles to adapt to the talkies. The legacy of “Singin’ in the Rain” is a through-line in “Babylon,” which more grimly depicts Hollywood’s adaptation to the advent of talkies — as hilariously captured in a scene when Nellie goes to record her first film with an on-set microphone and the challenge nearly brings the entire production to its knees.
“It’s one of my favorite movies of all time, and it definitely plays a big role in ‘Babylon.’ You know, in some ways, ‘Babylon’ is kind of this weird indirect origin story for ‘Singin’ in the Rain,’ almost like a making of without being a making of. But you see the roots where ‘Singin’ in the Rain’ came from. And I found that really interesting. ‘Singin’ in the Rain,’ of course, being this great example of Hollywood turning its gaze on itself, and sort of spoofing its own growing pains,” he said.
Chazelle also discussed how his time at Harvard impacted his career. He studied film in the Visual and Environmental Studies department (now the Art, Film, and Visual Studies department.) “I’ve always wanted to be a filmmaker … before I even knew what movies really were,” he said. From his earliest years watching animated Disney movies, he felt an instant connection to the art form. While he always had a passion for film, his Harvard education only deepened his understanding of the craft.
“The professors at Harvard really kind of opened my eyes to … this whole other world of making cinema that was outside the Hollywood mainstream, outside the normal commercial avenues,” he said. “And it was sort of liberating, it was the epitome of having your eyes opened wider.”
Chazelle emphasized that Harvard didn’t provide him with a mainstream Hollywood education — and he’s extremely grateful for it.
“What was actually, in retrospect, the greatest thing about the Harvard film program was that it wasn’t some sort of echo of Hollywood. It wasn’t like, ‘We’re going to try to give you the Hollywood experience before you go to Hollywood,’ it was the opposite of that … and it was actually really helpful and liberating to have this grounding at Harvard, in something completely outside of that, something even oppositional to that.”
At Harvard, Chazelle studied alternative forms like cinéma verité, documentary-style film, experimental film, and the avant garde, all of which helped shape him into the dynamic filmmaker he is today. He fondly remembers several professors from the film department, including Alfred Guzzetti, Robb Moss, and J.D. Connor; “I can’t emphasize how much I learned from them, and how much they helped me grow, not just as an artist, but even just thinking about film.” He explained that to this day he still attempts to infuse his fictional work with his knowledge of documentary and experimental-style filmmaking that he picked up at Harvard.
Chazelle’s very first feature film, a musical-romance called “Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench,” began as his senior thesis project at Harvard, and eventually premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2009, a year after his graduation. Discussing how his earlier films prepared him to embark on a project as ambitious as “Babylon,” which replicates the dramatic scope of early film sets complete with hundreds of extras and an expansive main cast, Chazelle noted that he faces the same challenges in projects of all different scopes.
“You still always feel like you don’t have enough money, you don’t have enough time, you can’t get this shot because the sun is going down, you have to run against time,” he said. But Chazelle highlighted how his fundamental approach to filmmaking hasn’t changed. “The footprint might grow larger, but you’re still, at the end of the day, just kind of putting pen to paper alone when you’re writing the script, or when you’re on a film set, just rolling a camera with an actor or two, trying to capture a moment that feels true, or that feels beautiful, or that feels interesting in some way. And that’s been the same as when I was making movies at Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While much of the “Hamilton”-mania that consumed American culture during its 2015 Broadway premiere has since died down, the show remains equally as original and engaging to this day. Directed by Thomas Kail, “Hamilton” (The North American Tour) runs from Jan. 17 through March 12 at the Citizens Bank Opera House. The Philip Cast upheld the show's reputation as a bona fide Broadway classic. The Musical’s timeless appeal and undeniable brilliance protects it from many of the common pitfalls that accompany a touring production. Moreover, “Hamilton” in Boston benefits not just from its masterful lyricism, but also from several standout performances and highly inventive staging.
It is no secret that Lin-Manuel Miranda’s biographical reimagining, mostly consisting of rap and hip-hop songs, is a rather stunning lyrical feat. But until audiences find themselves seated for a live production of “Hamilton,” it is hard to fully comprehend the scope of Miranda’s genius. Unlike when watching the filmed production on Disney+, the immersive experience of seeing “Hamilton” live requires a kind of careful attention in audiences that is hard to replicate in a distraction-filled living room.
A key ingredient in the show’s impeccable musical composition is its consistent and effective use of lyrical and sonic motifs. With the entire show sung at a rather brisk pace, it seems as though “Hamilton” would be difficult to comprehend. However, the reality is exactly the opposite. Many of the show’s most famous songs, such as “My Shot” and “Satisfied,” have choruses that reappear throughout the show to connect the various events of Hamilton’s life. This mode of lyrical reprisal lends a pleasant cumulative dimension to the show, using short-term recognition to ease audience comprehension. The end result is the rare musical that simultaneously presents excellent music and powerful messages.
As for the performers giving life to Miranda’s work in Boston, there were no weak links among the cast. However, some stars shined especially bright. Nikisha Williams (“Eliza Hamilton”) stole every one of her scenes with a voice that dazzled the entire opera house. And when Williams performed “Burn,” perhaps the most vocally-demanding and emotionally-charged number in the show, she cemented her standout status by singing and emoting with a deep sorrow that touched everyone in the theater. By never sacrificing believability for excessive dramatics, Williams brought the theater to complete, awe-inspired silence. Jared Dixon (“Aaron Burr”) was also exceptional, as his smooth and rich vocals contrasted beautifully with his character’s increasingly frenzied state of mind.
And while “Hamilton” does cover much important historical ground in its almost three hour running time, Miranda thankfully infuses much of the show with a light, comedic tone. This dimension of the production is most obviously conveyed in the characters of “Thomas Jefferson” and “King George III,” portrayed by Jared Howelton and Neil Haskell, respectively. Both actors imbued their characters with very humorous personalities and mannerisms, eliciting uproars of laughter from the audience on many occasions.
In addition to wonderful performances, the scenic design by David Korins is notably captivating. While the somewhat bare, rope-filled set spanning multiple levels has become iconic, its real success lies in the innovative use of a double-rotating stage. The rotating element makes the eye-catching choreography more dynamic and engaging. And during “The World Was Wide Enough,” when the show opts for a rare moment of stillness among the actors, the jarring contrast with the usually motion-filled stage successfully adds weight to the words being sung.
While this advice may seem superfluous in a post-Hamilfans world, Boston residents and visitors should make every effort to see the show before it leaves Boston in March. This production may not seek to reinvent the original “Hamilton” formula, but luckily for audiences, it’s a winner either way. Whether a reluctant theatergoer, a crazed fan, or somewhere in between, “Hamilton” is an exceptional artistic and educational experience that will win over the hearts of even the most skeptical attendees.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Walking into Harvard Yard for the first time, my eyes immediately settled on the prominent statue of John Harvard — commonly known as the statue of three lies. An icon of Harvard’s campus since 1884, the statue draws copious admirers every year, many of them at the ready with clicking cameras. On any given day, people line up to take a picture with John, and — advertently or inadvertently — end up rubbing his left foot in the hopes of earning good luck for themselves.
John Harvard’s foot has become a symbol of hope for tourists, whose frisky fingers have since polished the foot’s bronze cast into a gleaming gold. Every time I have passed by the statue, I have found at least one person at John’s foot — sometimes even a few — hauling up their small children, potential incoming Harvard students, to do the honors.
Despite the cheerful backdrop, I can’t help but cringe at the millions of visitors who come to try their luck.
As a Harvard student, I know what students do at the preeminent left foot as one of the college’s three most extreme traditions: urinate on it. So does touching the urinated-upon bronze foot bring luck or dread?
In my column, I will explore Harvard’s traditions through the lens of science, highlighting the often-overlooked empirical evidence one should consider when making decisions. As tourists and students alike, we get so caught up in the grandeur of traditions like touching John’s foot that we don’t really think of the potential health risks associated. In John’s case, the main safety concern is harmful bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms that might accumulate on John’s foot over time, making it a fomite for disease.
While recent studies have found bacteria in urine, that doesn’t necessarily mean infection is incoming: Researchers believe these bacteria may constitute a urinary microbiota, a normal and healthy community not unlike one’s gut. Urine is unlikely to transmit most major diseases, with one notable exception being typhoid. Although typhoid vaccination is not required for Harvard students, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports an estimated 5,700 cases in the United States each year, most of which are thought to originate from international travel.
A potentially overlooked source of pathogenic bug exchange at John’s foot is the tourists themselves. The constant traffic of touches creates an effective environment for such critters to proliferate. However, disease transfer through a bronze surface is rare, as the disease-causing agent would need to survive on the surface long enough to be transferred to a new individual. Furthermore, we need to take into account the porosity of the naked bronze of his toe: Because bronze is a porous metal, any bugs deposited by tourists’ hands may sink into the surface and away from future touches, instead of finding, ironically, a foot or toe hold.
According to science, this tradition appears to be innocuous. Despite the likely layers of bodily fluid on the statue’s foot, I’d wager that touching John Harvard’s left foot is probably as safe as touching any other public surface, like doors, phones, and pedestrian buttons. You should take similar safety precautions with the foot as you would with contact on any of those other surfaces. Harvard’s maintenance staff already does, power-washing John like a car five or six times a year. To further rid John of pathogens, Harvard should consider periodically deep-cleaning and disinfecting the statue.
Even if we’re not sure how safe it is, people’s indulgence in this tradition is a fascinating part of Harvard’s history. Touching the foot is a way for individuals to connect with Harvard, and be a part of the University’s culture.
As for the luck derived from this act, the jury is still out. It is difficult to know whether you can really derive luck from touching any object. I’m personally not superstitious, but I’m a little stitious. A simple change in mindset can significantly impact how you view life’s challenges.
When I visited campus as a tourist, I fully believed touching John’s foot was really going to skew college admissions in my favor, giving me the subsequent boost of confidence to try to sneak into Annenberg Hall. Although that attempt was ultimately unsuccessful, a few months later, I was accepted to the College. So go ahead and try your luck — regardless of the verdict. But be wary of what may be lurking in the surfaces you’re interacting with, and don’t forget to sanitize afterward!

From “godfather” of human rights to Harvard reject: After nearly three decades of holding those in power accountable as the executive director of Human Rights Watch, Kenneth Roth’s fellowship appointment at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Carr Center for Human Rights Policy was vetoed by Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf. Why? Roth alleges that this decision was punishment for HRW’s coverage of Israel during his tenure, which included accusations that Israel was committing crimes of apartheid against the Palestinian people.
Even though Elmendorf has since reversed his veto, we cannot help but be struck by the enormity of this initial failure — the unconscionable dismissal of a man who transformed human rights from a fellowship at a center that studies human rights, which nearly consigned Roth to the eternal status of being the Carr Center’s “one that got away.”
In our view, this outrageous (and outrage-inducing) decision can be understood two ways, both of which place the blame squarely on Dean Elmendorf. In one version of events, Elmendorf heard criticisms of Roth, fundamentally misunderstood who he was and what he stood for, and pressed the red button. In another, Elmendorf knew exactly what he was doing as he rebuffed the world’s leading human rights expert because he lacked the courage to weather any blowback for Roth’s positions.
Either way, we worry about what this case says about the status of academic inquiry at a school like Harvard — one enmeshed in this nation’s headiest networks of power, where the risk of improper influence by outside actors on academic decisions may be uniquely high. This is especially true at HKS, which features strikingly close ties to government officials and the national security complex. Strolling through the annexes of 79 John F. Kennedy Street, it is not out of the ordinary to encounter a Congresswoman holding forth amid a gaggle of students or a former General with a star or four chatting it up over coffee. One can imagine without difficulty how such interpersonal proximity — not to mention the influence of the well-monied donors that support it — could create quid pro quo dynamics with which we should all be uncomfortable.
No price, personal or pecuniary, can approach the value of free academic inquiry at an institution dedicated to truth-seeking. Without exaggeration, one can say that the principles of academic freedom and free speech have made possible some of humankind’s greatest triumphs — its moon landings, its peacemakings, its Pulitzers, its democracies. Suffice it to say, the influence of donors within our institution should never be applied to suffocate academic freedom. Our University's leaders must have the courage to ensure that this is so.
Given everything, we ought to acknowledge that it is possible that these dynamics had the effect of curtailing academic freedom at Harvard even prior to the well-publicized case of Kenneth Roth. The reversal of Dean Elmendorf's decision is hardly the norm when it comes to hiring decisions based on reasons immaterial to the nature of a candidate’s work in the school. If this can happen to Roth, a venerable titan within a globally-renowned field, it can happen to anyone — and those without Roth’s connections or cache will be, and almost certainly have been, hard-pressed to hold the University accountable.
As we have previously argued regarding tenure, transparency is essential. While preserving appropriate standards of confidentiality in the hiring process, Harvard should take the opportunity to establish robust accountability measures regarding prominent academic placements across the University, including the incorporation of faculty committee oversight so as to insulate these decisions from any improper financial influence.
To his credit, Dean Elmendorf has agreed to bring faculty into the fellowship approval process; we expect that the University will clearly communicate the accountability structure of such a faculty committee to both our community and the public. In the same vein of transparency, we call on President Bacow to initiate an official investigation into why Dean Elmendorf rejected Roth’s fellowship and determine, among other things, whether claims of donor influence can be substantiated.
The best apology Harvard can give Roth is its improvement. We hope it will. We hope this incident will serve as an opportunity for Harvard to boldly and ambitiously double down on its commitment to academic freedom in hiring University-wide.
Until then, to Kenneth Roth: On behalf of a community much larger than its administration, we want to apologize and thank you for having the grace to come back. As students who hope to learn from your expertise, we’re glad you won’t be the one that got away.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Through all the ups and downs of my two years at Harvard, from Housing Day to the Harvard-Yale Game, one constant has persisted in the background.
A small, usually brown animal, scurrying along across the street, or flattened unceremoniously on the road. An animal glorified in Ratatouille and studied in labs across our campus.
If you haven’t caught on by now: Yes, I am writing about rats.
In my most recent encounter, just a month ago, I jumped on my swivel chair as I viewed the engorged body of a rat in its attempt to enter my well-warmed bathroom. My screams resulted in the rat running back to its hiding place: my closet. My scream became a cacophony when my roommate realized what I saw, and we immediately called Yard Operations in our panicked consternation.
When we told them about the problem, they started to laugh, assuring us that someone would arrive at our dorm in five minutes. While I appreciated their responsiveness, I was confused about why they were not similarly disgusted. Upon arrival, our Yard Ops representative was similarly confused, because he assumed it was our neighbors who had called — apparently, they also had a rat situation. He told us that rats had been slowly working their way up the dorm, reaching the third floor, a level above our own.
As I attempted to fall asleep in a room I was actively scared to stay in, with my desk lamp firmly on, I wondered how we got into this situation, and what I had done to attract these obnoxious rodents.
Cambridge is not alone in facing a rat problem; many of the surrounding residential areas are also battling an influx of rats exacerbated by the pandemic. Experts speculate that the growing suburban population, milder winters, and pandemic closures of high-producing trash areas like restaurants mean that the local rats have turned their wandering noses toward residential areas. This development has led to Cambridge creating a position of rat liaison, to serve as a point of contact between the public and Cambridge City Council for all rat-related complaints and information.
All I could think about, as I tried to fall asleep that terrifying night, is why we need a specialized rat liaison — not just the multipurpose tool of Yard Ops — here at Harvard. More than a sassy guide, we need a compassionate, human individual to guide us in our legitimate rat-inspired plight.
Although the proper methods to handle animal infestations might be obvious to students who come from New York City or rural areas, that isn’t true for everyone, making dorm-wide coordination difficult. At home in Arizona, although we have roof rats, my family easily controls our indoor rodent population because we inhabit every room in our house, leaving no crevice for stray rodents. In a community of people with different habits of food storage and trash removal like Harvard’s undergraduate dorms, it is much harder to stop the invasion. A rat liaison could help to coordinate connecting living areas and inform each inhabitant about practices to decrease the rat population. In my own Russell Hall, if we were able to end the infestation on the first floor, or at least stop the rodents from traveling upwards, then my neighbors and I on the second floor need not have experienced this calamity.
Another aspect in which a rat liaison could be helpful is providing a guide for living with such undesired roommates if preventative efforts are unsuccessful; I know I would have appreciated a crash course in how to live with rats. The week before the break, when I had to deal with the rats, I slept with most of my head covered, scared that I would wake up to a furry face close to my own. My sleep was rocky, culminating with a dream in which the Transportation Security Administration detained me for transporting animals domestically because they found a dorm rat in my luggage.
I know this sounds ridiculous, but it’s ridiculous to have to coexist with an extra roommate that does not pay rent. Rodents such as rats can carry diseases like hantavirus, rat bite fever, or lymphocytic choriomeningitis, which are all transmittable to humans. During finals week, it would have been nice to have a good night’s rest and be able to turn my lamp off, or even just to have someone at which to vent about infestations.
If my life imitated art, this would be the point where I have a change of heart. I would let go of my disgust and fear of the rat living in my dorm. Slowly we would become friends, and my dorm rat would inform me that they are cousins with Remy from Ratatouille. They would turn out to be a pastry chef and produce culinary delights, and slowly my rat would replace Harvard University Dining Service with a Pâtisserie.
But unfortunately, my life does not imitate this particular arc of Ratatouille. While my current dorm in Adams House will be renovated soon, I know my troubles will not end here. With a liaison, I could dream of pastries instead of rats — once I slow down my heart to an acceptable pace.

Hundreds gathered in Harvard’s Sanders Theatre Sunday for the first in-person Ivy League Spring Festival Gala since 2019.
The gala, which is an annual celebration of Lunar New Year hosted by the Harvard Chinese Students and Scholars Association, featured more than 130 performers across different universities. The event was held virtually for the past two years.
The gala started off with a dance performance, followed by a speech from Vice Provost for International Affairs Mark C. Elliott. Performers took the stage with a variety of acts, including hip-hop, traditional folk music, skits, kung fu, and acapella.
Yuhan Zhang, a Linguistics Ph.D. student at Harvard and the executive producer of the event, said that watching the Chinese Spring Festival Gala with family is “one of the most traditional ways to celebrate the Lunar Chinese New Year.”
She added that the gala was intended for international students who are unable to return home to celebrate and watch the Spring Festival Gala.
According to Zhang, the gala was recorded and uploaded online during the past two years of the Covid-19 pandemic.
“The biggest difference this year is that we finally are able to welcome the audience, be able to interact with them, and see their faces,” Zhang said. “This kind of interaction and this kind of opportunity to have hundreds of people in the same venue to celebrate one thing — it’s very magnificent and exciting.”
Chaomei Wang, a senior at Brandeis University, performed “Can’t Take My Eyes off of You.” She said she chose this song because “it’s a song about love,” and it was slower than other performances at the event.
Francesco Efrem Bonetti ’26, a potential East Asian Studies concentrator who attended the gala, said he “really loved” the event, especially the traditional folk music performance.
“I really loved the songs they played,” he said. “I also already knew them, so it was very nice to hear them play live for the first time.”
Xinran "Olivia" Ma ’26 said she attended the gala because it was a “big part” of her Chinese identity and the traditions she grew up with.
“I’m from China — born and raised — and I came here for high school, and it’s just an important part of me,” Ma said. “As an international student, I think it’s a nice way to connect.”
Harvard Business School student and HCSSA member Yilun “Bill” Ding — who helped organize the event — also discussed bridging the gap between cultures in the United States and China through traditional performances at Harvard.
“I really liked the kung fu performance, because it is a traditional martial arts,” Ding said.
“I think it has a good mixture of the Eastern culture and the Western Culture — showing those cultures can coexist very well,” he added.
During the event, Elliott delivered a speech mostly in Mandarin Chinese, switching to English to acknowledge the “uneasy” relations between the U.S. and China.
He said he is determined that Harvard will continue “affirming the importance of collaboration” between Harvard and Chinese universities.
“Institutions of higher education have a special role to play — a positive role to play — in making sure that the connections between our two great countries remain strong, and that they are moving in the right direction,” Elliott added.
Zhang said she hopes the gala was able to bring people together to appreciate Chinese culture.
“For Chinese students and for international students or for students from Asian countries, I want them to appreciate the show — with curiosity, with memories related to their home country, with their childhood — and have a moment to remember and have a moment to appreciate their history,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology recently transferred ownership of an ancestral Alutiiq, or Sugpiaq, kayak to the Alutiiq Museum, a cultural museum and tribal repository in Kodiak, Alaska, according to a Jan. 24 press release from the Alaskan museum.
The relocation of the kayak — which spans 14.5 feet in length — is part of the Peabody’s ongoing efforts to repatriate cultural artifacts of Native American origin. The announcement comes nearly two years after Harvard was accused of being in violation of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act by the Association on American Indian Affairs.
The Alutiiq Museum requested the ownership transfer in the fall of 2022, citing spiritual reasons. Due to its seams embellished by human hair, the kayak was likely used for “talismanic purposes.” Complete with a wooden frame covered in oiled seal skin, the boat is a “rare example of a complete ancestral kayak,” according to the press release.
April G. Laktonen Counceller, the executive director of the Alutiiq Museum, said in the press statement that Alutiiq tradition places strong cultural significance on artifacts containing hair, which are said to serve as a spiritual conduit between the original ancestor and whoever is in current possession of the object.
“Our ancestors incorporated hair into garments, tools, and ceremonial items like dolls to forge spiritual connections,” she said in the release. “It appears that the symbolic and spiritual qualities of another person bolstered the person who paddled this boat. For the Alutiiq/Sugpiaq people, the boat is a spiritually powerful object and best cared for by our community.”
The boat has been displayed at the Alutiiq Museum since 2016, where it has been displayed on loan as a part of an exhibit on maritime technology. It originally entered the Peabody’s collection in 1869, as a gift from U.S. Army Officer Edward Fast, where it was kept in storage until conservation efforts in 2011.
Peabody Director Jane Pickering called maintaining relationships with tribal groups “fundamental” to the museum’s curatorial work.
“We are pleased, as the University considers the return of cultural items in its collections, that the kayak will remain at the Alutiiq Museum, at the heart of the community,” Pickering said in the press release.
The Alutiiq Museum is now undergoing renovations to its facilities and hopes to have the kayak as one of its central gallery pieces.
“The kayak is one of our visitor’s favorite objects, and we plan to install it on a display about spring hunting,” Counceller said in the press release. “Preserved in its wooden frame, lashings, and skin cover are construction techniques used by a skilled ancestral boat builder that can help us continue to learn while we honor the ancestors whose skill and essence are preserved in the vessel.”

Carolyn R. Bertozzi ’88, winner of the 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, first heard Harvard Medical School emeritus professor Christopher T. Walsh ’65 speak when she was a graduate student attending an American Chemical Society meeting.
Bertozzi recalled the speakers giving “pompous” lectures that were hard to follow.
But when Walsh took the stage, “it was a total inversion,” she said. Bertozzi said he picked the research project of one of his postdoctoral fellows at the time, introduced it as a “mystery we wanted to understand,” and led the audience through the hypothesis, data, and lessons learned along the way.
“That has been the model that I’ve used ever since then,” Bertozzi said. “That was more than 30 years ago, and that lesson has been a guiding principle for me. And so when I give lectures, that’s what I try to do — exactly what Chris did in that moment.”
Walsh, a renowned biochemist, died on Jan. 10 at the age of 78.
He received his undergraduate degree in biology from Harvard College and his Ph.D. in life science from Rockefeller University. In 1987, HMS recruited Walsh from MIT, where he had established himself as a leading researcher in the field of biological chemistry.
Throughout his career, Walsh made significant contributions to the field of biochemistry, particularly in the areas of enzyme function, metabolic pathways, and antibiotic biosynthesis. Under his guidance as chair of the Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, HMS became a leader in structural biology. His work contributed to the development of novel antibiotics and advancing knowledge of enzyme structure.
HMS Dean George Q. Daley ’82, who served as a faculty member alongside Walsh in the BCMP Department, recognized Walsh’s work at MIT, HMS, and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in a Jan. 12 statement.
“Everyone around him aspired to work harder and be more rigorous because he respected excellence and inspired excellence in others,” Daley wrote.
Stephen C. Blacklow ’83, who currently occupies Walsh’s former role as the chair of the BCMP Department, wrote in an email that Walsh had a “tremendous influence” on many people’s careers, including Blacklow’s own.
“He was well-loved by many in our community for his generosity of spirit, and wry sense of humor, and was deeply appreciated for his intellectual rigor and tireless dedication to excellence,” he added.
Blacklow wrote that Walsh’s death was “so tragic, and so sudden.”
“I still keep hoping it’s just a nightmare from which I will soon awaken,” he wrote.
Walsh’s approach to research allowed him to make connections between seemingly unrelated areas of study.
David E. Golan ’75, dean for Research Operations and Global Programs at HMS, said Walsh proposed the “interesting experiment” of combining the departments of biological chemistry and pharmacology, which resulted in the BCMP Department.
“He had an uncanny knack for choosing people with tremendous potential and for seeing what the scientific fields were going to be that were going to make a difference,” Golan said. “As department chair, he really transformed both departments.”
Golan said Walsh helped strengthen the fields of structural biology and chemical biology as well as HMS’ research in the field of chemistry.
“He made a concerted effort when he came to hire the best structural biologists in the world and the best chemical biologists in the world,” Golan said. “Chris saw the future and he took active steps to make sure that we were well-represented with people who would be at the cutting edge in terms of their research as well as recruiting students.”
In addition to his research, Walsh’s colleagues said he was also a dedicated educator. Bertozzi, a colleague of Walsh during his time as an adjunct professor at Stanford, called him a “consummate scholar, teacher, and mentor,” pointing to the numerous textbooks he wrote.
“All of them have been widely used and highly influential in educating the next generation of scientists,” Bertozzi said. “He has provided us with this incredible arsenal of beautifully-digested and synthesized information so that we can teach our students about the kind of work that he was interested in.”
JoAnne Stubbe, who shared the 2010 Welch Prize in Chemistry with Walsh, said Walsh’s model of teaching was “the greatest gift” he gave her.
“From looking, watching him do it, he taught me how to teach,” Stubbe said. “I didn’t know anybody that had that ability to take all this complex stuff and turn it into something that people get really interested in.”
Bertozzi and Kari C. Nadeau, a professor of medicine and pediatrics at Stanford University, said Walsh was an advocate for women in science.
“It was challenging sometimes for women to find positions where they would have good mentorship in science and have someone to help support their career aspirations,” Bertozzi said. “Chris Walsh was a person who had many women in his lab, and many of them he advocated for and are now very famous in their own right.”
Nadeau — who was mentored by Walsh as an M.D. Ph.D. student at HMS — described him as an “extraordinary scholar, a visionary leader, and a genuine human being.”
She recalled how Walsh would greet his mentees at the laboratory each morning.
“I’d always get to hear his footsteps first, and I knew that the next thing that I would see in the morning is a bright smile coming in and asking, ‘How are things going?’” Nadeau said. “I absolutely love that memory because it’s so special that a lab mentor will take the time every day to come down the hallway and meet with us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvey A. Silverglate, a 1967 Harvard Law School graduate who is staging an outsider campaign for election to the Harvard Board of Overseers, said he will probably not meet the signature threshold to see his name on the ballot, but pledged to continue his bid with a write-in campaign.
Silverglate is in the final days of a petition campaign to appear on this year’s ballot for the Board of Overseers, the University’s second-highest governing board. Silverglate, who is running on a platform of downsizing Harvard’s administration and upholding free speech, has 330 of 3,000 signatures needed to appear on the ballot as of Tuesday.
All Harvard alumni — except current Harvard faculty, administrators, or members of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body — are eligible to vote to elect overseers to the 30-member body.
The Harvard Alumni Association nominating committee tapped eight candidates for the ballot this year, but candidates can also join through a petition campaign if they receive signatures from 1 percent of the number of eligible voters in last year’s election by Feb. 1. Voting in the 2023 Board of Overseers election is set to open on March 31.
This is not the first time Silverglate has run for the Board of Overseers. He managed to gather enough petition signatures to appear on the ballot in 2009, but his campaign was ultimately unsuccessful.
With only a sixth of the requisite signatures, Silverglate cast blame on recent changes to the Board of Overseers electoral system for the petition campaign he expects will fall short.
“The Board of Overseers made it harder in recent years for people to get in by petition and nomination,” Silverglate said. “By making it so difficult, you tend to get people who agree on everything and who don’t understand that the modern university, especially Harvard — certainly, including Harvard — has gone off on a wrong direction.”
University spokesperson Christopher M. Hennessy declined to comment.
Since Silverglate ran in 2009, the Board of Overseers has passed several amendments to its electoral processes.
The board increased the threshold to appear on the election ballot as a petition candidate in 2016, raising the requirement from just over 200 signatures to 1 percent of the number of eligible voters in the previous election.
The change represented the first major hike of the signature threshold in a century, with the first election after the 2016 reform mandating roughly 2,650 signatures to get on the ballot — more than a tenfold increase from the previous year.
Harvard announced in 2020 that it would allow only six successful petition candidates to sit on the Board of Overseers at any given time. The other 24 members must be elected from a list of candidates selected by the HAA nominating committee.
The 2020 changes were unveiled one month after three petition candidates backed by Harvard Forward won election to the board. Harvard Forward was founded in 2019 with the goal of increasing recent alumni representation and support for fossil fuel divestment among overseers.
Nathán Goldberg Crenier ’18, who co-founded Harvard Forward, said the electoral reforms show that “Harvard is joining a growing anti-democratic strain of politics.”
“They don’t like student activism, they don’t like faculty activism, they then have this avenue for alumni to express their voice, and when it’s used they say, ‘No, not like that,’” Crenier said.
Crenier said the reforms to the Board of Overseers after victories by Harvard Forward-backed candidates showed that Harvard’s “reaction to a democratic election that they did not like was to move away from democracy.”
“The administrators in University Hall right are not the heartbeat of Harvard,” Crenier added. “So the fact that the bureaucrats essentially are saying, ‘Ok, well, we disagree with what students, faculty, and alumni are saying, so we get the final call’ is, I think, a little short-sighted.”
Silverglate, who was not endorsed by Harvard Forward, said he is calling on Harvard to fire 95 percent of its administrators and reduce tuition by 40 percent.
“Even if I don’t get enough signatures to get on the ballot, and even if I don’t get enough write-ins, I think I did send a message — and I’m hoping that justifies the amount of time and energy,” Silverglate said.
“But Harvard has both a leadership position and it’s also a symbol,” he added. “If we can straighten Harvard out, the rest of the country will follow.”
Correction: January 31, 2023
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Harvey A. Silverglate had collected roughly 500 signatures in in his attempt to appear on this year's ballot for the Board of Overseers. In fact, Silverglate had only 330 signatures as of Tuesday.

It’s 1:30 a.m. You open up Canvas only to find you have 300 pages of reading due tomorrow. Maybe the Q Guide lied to you about that “gem” Gen Ed. Maybe you decided to tempt fate and take Humanities 10. Or maybe you went to the Pfoho Igloo yesterday (sorry) and figured you could get through it in one night. Don’t stress! As the readings start to pile up, here are some strategies to deal with those Sunday scaries.
Start early
This may seem like wishful thinking, but it’s much better to read a manageable amount everyday than cram last-minute. It’s simply not fun to read about Kantian ethics for three hours straight. Who knows? Maybe you can even make it fun and rewarding. Read 40 pages, eat a cookie! Read 20 more pages, go to Trader Joe’s, replenish the cookie stash, and then finish it again.
Read smarter aka advanced skimming 
More realistically, we don’t have time for all those readings. So, get out those highlighters and start advanced skimming. Take notes on the most important information and focus on what you don’t already understand. If you’re really in a bind, stick to the topic and conclusion sentences and the bolded words your textbook conveniently provides (they’re basically encouraging skimming, no?).
Look at the ARC’s offerings 
Harvard’s Academic Resource Center offers strategic reading workshops, academic coaching, and peer tutoring for help with specific courses. Their website also has information on efficient note-taking, reading well, and honoring priorities (this one’s for you, Igloo-ers).
Have a mini existential crisis, if needed
Sometimes you just can’t avoid the panic and dread. Lean into it. Question why you took the course and complain to anyone who is willing to listen, tell yourself you’ll start earlier next time even though you know you won’t, dye your hair a horrendous color only to reverse the job in a week, leave your responsibilities behind and move to Hawaii, or do all of the above. It’s healthy to get it all out and breakdowns are a great excuse to practice some definitely solid coping mechanisms.
Take a break 
If it’s daytime: Stand up! Stretch! Focus on a faraway object for a bit. Maybe even leave the sad, dark, corner of Lamont you’ve been sitting in all night and see what the weather’s like today. If it’s nighttime: Sleep! (seriously). Getting some sleep will help you concentrate when you wake up in three hours. And, who doesn’t like putting off their problems until the morning?
Unfortunately, long readings are here to stay, but we hope these tips will help you be a bit more strategic in how you approach them. And if not, and you’re procrastinating anyway, check this out before you get back to work!
