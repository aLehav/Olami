After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney edged out fellow presidential hopeful Rick Santorum by just eight votes in Tuesday’s Iowa caucuses—a miniscule margin which Harvard professors said reflects dissatisfaction with the candidacy of presumed frontrunner Romney and internal division among Republicans.
“Last night was a victory for [Romney], but the problem that the conservatives have is that they don’t have a candidate that they’re settled on,” said David R. Gergen, the director of the Harvard Kennedy School’s Center for Public Leadership and a political analyst.
Though a record number of Iowans turned out at the caucuses, no standout emerged among the pack of Republicans vying to take on President Barack Obama in the general election. Romney and Santorum each garnered roughly 25 percent of the vote. Congressman Ron Paul trailed closely behind with roughly 21 percent, while former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Texas Governor Rick Perry failed to rally voters as they had expected, ending with roughly 10 percent of the vote each.
Government professor Theda R. Skocpol said that a fundamental shift has taken place within the Republican Party which helps explain Romney’s difficulty in winning over a majority of party voters. Skocpol said that the rise of the Tea Party movement, separate from the party’s mainstream, has hurt Romney because Tea Party voters are dissatisfied with his reputation as an establishment politician.
Yet that growing movement has not helped any another candidate enough to lift their choice above Romney in the polls. “I do think the problem that Tea Partiers have is that they can’t unite behind a single candidate,” Skocpol said. “There is a split between evangelical and libertarian wings of the party.” She pointed out that Santorum and Paul, both affiliated with the Tea Party, split the faction’s votes but received almost 50 percent of caucus-goers' votes between them.
In a speech in Iowa on Tuesday night, Romney, a Harvard Law School and Business School alumnus, declared that day’s caucuses a victory for his campaign.
Prior to Tuesday’s results, many questioned whether the former Massachusetts governor, often derided as a “moderate” by other candidates, could win over Iowa conservatives. Professors say that eking out a win by a single-digit margin was not a feat that indicates that Romney pulled off an impressive victory.
“The turnout last night was not what they had hoped,” said Gergen. “If you look at the percentage that Romney actually won, it’s the lowest percentage by which any person has won in the history of the Iowa caucuses. He’s got an enthusiasm gap .. that he’s got to fix.”
Romney’s numbers in Iowa fell slightly from four years ago, when he also campaigned for the presidential nomination. That year, he lost the state to former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee. But while candidates such as Santorum, Gingrich, and Paul campaigned hard in the state for months, Romney did not to enter the fray until December, at which point he increased the money and the time he spent in Iowa.
“Romney actually went all in in Iowa in the last month, and the fact that he wasn’t able to improve his standing from four years ago means he’s in for a longer battle, and that’s not what he wanted,” Skocpol said.
Even among traditional Republicans, Romney has stirred up little enthusiasm. Professors said that voters see him as difficult to relate to, yet he has held on to the frontrunner position in a hotly contested race because they also see him as more likely to win in the general election than other candidates.
“He is clearly by all the polls seen as more electable that anyone else on the Republic side, and he is closer ideologically to where most of the country is,” Gergen said.
The results in Iowa, which come close to a three-way tie, reflect a general dissatisfaction with the candidates with which Republican voters have been presented so far, professors said.
“[Romney’s] inability to break through 25 percent in national polling is the search for an alternative,” said government professor Stephen D. Ansolabehere, a scholar of democracy and elections.
Congresswoman Michele Bachmann dropped out of the running after receiving very little support from Iowans. Gingrich and Perry chose to remain in the race despite the setback they experienced in Iowa.
“I think the narrative about the selection is going to be sharpened where we’re now seeing this as a choice between true conservatism and electability,” Ansolabehere said of the race for the nomination in the weeks ahead.
Analysts have widely predicted that Romney will easily win in New Hampshire’s primary next Tuesday, but questions about his chances in southern states’ primaries later this month remain. Those questions, Harvard professors said, may prolong the competition during the primary season far longer than Republican leaders might hope.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It truly is the most wonderful time of the year. On Dec. 25, we all shared in a gift that is way better than any Christmas sweater or box of chocolates. Yep, professional basketball is back. To ring in the good times, we at The Back Page have set out to find the best NBA match for several of Harvard’s own ballers. Which NBA player is most like each Crimson star? Keep reading to find out.
Christian Webster – 6.1 PPG, 2.2 RPG, .9 APG (2011-2012 season)
A solid defender and shooter throughout his three years at Harvard, Webster has displayed the ability to hit shots from both inside the arc and downtown. During his sophomore year, the Harvard wing shot a personal best 43.5 percent from the field, a number that proved good for second best among Crimson guards. This season against Boston University, Webster made six out of 10 field goals, including two three-pointers, for a total of 14 points. His ability to slash to the basket adds to his versatility and his 6’5, 205-pound frame makes him difficult to defend. Which NBA player possesses a similar skill set?
Caron Butler – 16.5 PPG, 5.9 RPG, 2.8 APG (Career)
Now with the Los Angeles Clippers, Butler will not be expected to be his team’s top scorer, just as Webster has taken a backseat offensively to co-captain Keith Wright and junior Kyle Casey. But Butler’s ability to both drive to the basket and connect with his jumper makes him a threat for opponents. At 6’7 and 217 pounds, Butler is taller than most guards, but not as bulky as many NBA forwards. This combination allows him to succeed at both putting the ball on the floor and pulling up for the J.
While Butler has a slight height advantage, he and Webster possess similar physiques and playing styles. Though Butler chooses to play inside-ball more than Webster does, both have decent shots and versatility, making them offensive weapons.

Hey cool cats, take a break from listening to The Decemberists and read this: there might be some science behind your hipness.
Harvard researchers published an article entitled "Social Selection and Peer Influence in an Online Social Network" in which they discussed collecting Facebook data from 200 college students over a four-year period with the goal of determining why friends are similar. One thing they discovered is that friends tend to become friends because they are similar.
But don't worry about turning into a trendsetting square any time soon. Once you have friends, the research shows that if they start humming along to indie/alternative bands, you're significantly less likely to start jamming to the same tunes. According to the research, classical and jazz are the only kinds of music that are socially contagious.
"The meaning of indie alternative taste lies not in taste itself, but in being the only one in your group that likes it," said Kevin Lewis, lead researcher, Ph.D. Candidate in the sociology department, and a tutor in Currier House. "If friends start liking the same band I do then I'm no longer distinctive, it's no longer unique myself, so I'm more likely to drop it and find another 'hip' band."
You dig? Your uniqueness is safe, as long as you have friends.
