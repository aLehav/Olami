After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, University employee Eric Clopper performed a one-man show entitled “Sex and Circumcision: An American Love Story” in Sanders Theatre. Reports later claimed that, during his show, Clopper stripped to the nude and made anti-Semitic comments, including accusations that “the Jews” had “raped” him through the act of circumcision. As such, the University is reviewing the show and its apparent violation of the City of Cambridge’s entertainment license with Sanders Theatre, which prohibits nudity.
While we support artists’ right to free expression as a general principle, Clopper misbranded his show, omitting his fringe anti-Judaism beliefs in the show's public advertising. Posters of a censored yet nude Clopper and paid promoters in penis costumes made no mention of Clopper’s anti-circumcision stance, much less his anti-Semitic one. Campuses should be places of free speech and open dialogue. Clopper’s tirade put this principle to reprehensible ends by falsely billing the show as an “American Love Story” instead of a bigoted criticism of, in Clopper’s words, the Jewish “fucking covenant.”
The disparity between the extensive branding and the actual performance likely forced unexpecting members of Harvard’s community to endure a barrage of anti-Semitic claims. If students are not prepared to engage with the discussion at hand, universities cannot build on previous academic growth or free dialogue. Thus, rather than opening the campus to constructive dialogue or comedic entertainment, Clopper only sowed more confusion among Harvard students and the general public, undermining free discourse and the marketplace of ideas.
Moreover, Clopper’s own position as a Jewish man does not grant legitimacy to his bigotry. In a video posted to YouTube after the show, Clopper argues that his Judaism legitimizes his criticism of Jewish practices, and that non-Jewish people do not have the right to criticize this. We disagree. Anti-Semitism is anti-Semitism, and Clopper’s claims, such as his belief in Judaism’s “demonstrably evil influence” on the United States, are anti-Semitic. Individuals can espouse hateful speech toward identities that they hold, and their identity does not give validity to their views when they do.
Clopper’s nudity, as it pertains to Sanders Theatre’s entertainment license, presents an area in which the University must explain its timeline of review. Given that nudity is not allowed in Sanders’ contract, it is heartening that the University is “currently engaged in a review of these reports to determine whether Harvard was provided with an accurate account of the content of Mr. Clopper’s show, prior to its production,” according to Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Rachael Dane. If Clopper misrepresented his show to violate this license, that presents further cause for criticism of his actions. If, on the other hand, the University was cognizant of Clopper’s intention to strip naked, it should have taken action to prevent him from doing so, for the sake of decency to the unsuspecting audience and of not violating Sanders’ contract.
Clopper could have used his time and energy leading up to the show, coupled with the legitimacy of Sanders Theatre, to perform a comedic one-man show about circumcision as an “American Love Story." He could have even used it to offer a serious critique of circumcision practices as they pertain to the Jewish faith without veering into anti-Semitic beliefs. Instead, he used his position to deliver a tirade prominently featuring nudity and anti-Semitism to an audience that was given no fair warning to expect either. We castigate his doing so.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This was not the column I planned to write this week. (Planned might be a strong word, though. I nearly forgot I had one more piece to close out the semester and barely got this in before the deadline.) In keeping with the more forceful challenges I wanted to pose to the societal status quo and the Harvard community in this semester’s columns, I had planned to proffer as powerful and profound a commentary as I could muster on some prevailing current issue.
From the perplexing alteration of school anthem “Fair Harvard” to The Crimson Editorial Board’s latest HCFA hysteria to whatever is happening on the Korean peninsula, there’s no shortage of small and large controversies that I could have waded into, to leave a lingering last word. As many of my peers and friends would unfortunately be able to tell you (bless their hearts for putting up with all of it), I have no shortage of opinions on these controversies either.
But as I sat down this week at my computer to wax poetic, my usual diatribe energy was severely depleted, motivation and morale was waning quickly, and my copious exams and papers loudly demanded my attention. Apathy reigned supreme, and I just didn’t care. Was it the stress of finals? The burnout from a hellish junior year finally catching up with me?
Perhaps more of a pessimistic nihilism had something to do with it. Over the course of completing all my classes this semester, I will have written so many words and sentences and pages and run hundreds of lines of Stata code and stared at my computer for so long and I cannot help but wallow in the drudgery of the fact that it all means nothing. It means nothing. Most of my work is going to be cursorily evaluated and then forgotten forever.
Don’t get me wrong: I believe very strongly in the worth of my education here, and I know that these last few challenging weeks play a critical role in knowledge formation and character-building. I will cheat myself out of the fullness of a Harvard education if I am not willing to bear down and get through it. But as the sound and fury silently rage on in my Google Docs and PowerPoints and my refuge in the Classics library, it seems to ultimately signify nothing to me.
Sound and fury continue to rage on around me in the titles on display in our dining halls, at the Harvard Book Store, on Facebook, in the news (or whatever passes for news these days). It seems everyone has something to say about everything, whether by demand on an exam or by choice in the public sphere. Usually I find the chaos an appealing challenge, but now the volume is deafening, and the noise is exhausting.
As the long-awaited allure of spring finally beckons outside my bleak Mather House window, hunkering down in the library and writing a column and another paper to add to the sound and fury is the last thing I want to do. I don’t really want to respond to race-to-the-bottom arguments on the latest campus controversy, I’d rather race kayaks on the Charles with my friends and roommates. I am quite tired of regurgitating the omitted variable bias equation on practice econometrics exams, and would far rather attend to the actual people I’ve been omitting from my life for so many weeks.
I’ve long respected (and argued many a time with) the author of the Crimson column, The Village Idiot, and was particularly struck by his thought that Harvard students buy the “perverse lie” that “your grades will somehow reimburse you for your lost time, time that you should’ve spent developing the relationships that matter most.” I can’t help but wonder about how much time I’ve lost here, and also can’t help but mildly regret all the time I spend arguing and ranting with people.
What is the value of another hour studying compared to an hour spent with a friend? Would I genuinely rather win an argument with them or just be together with them? There are correct answers to these questions, and I’m not always sure I answer properly.
As I confront the reality of The Village Idiot (who is far from an idiot) and so many of my other senior friends leaving, I’m closing my computer and leaving the Classics library. I’ve got to go catch one last meal with a friend.

We lose something when we ask “is it legal?” without also asking “is it good?” It is the lower standard of the former to which we often rally when we defend our allies and the higher standard of the latter when we confront those whom we oppose. Our ideological blinders prevent us from being consistent in the questions we ask. And yet, decency requires consistent concern for goodness and not merely legality.
It is the lower standard of legality to which the members of the Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers have sunk throughout their organizing efforts. During the authorization campaign, the effort to satisfy the thresholds needed to hold an election, union organizers acquired the signatures of over 60 percent of the proposed bargaining unit, far exceeding the 30 percent required for an NLRB-brokered election, but in the subsequent vote, the first election, only 37 percent of the bargaining unit voted to unionize, with 1,526 voting against, 1,396 in favor, and 828 not voting. By the final tally, nearly 40 percent fewer students voted for unionization as signed authorization cards. Those signatories filled out a card with the stated purpose authorizing the HGSU-UAW to “represent me for the purposes of collective bargaining with my employer over wages, benefits, working conditions and other terms and conditions of employment.”
Though students may have changed their minds in the intervening months, one plausible explanation for the union losing two-fifths of its putative supporters between the authorization campaign and the first election is that the organizers failed to explain what signing the card really meant, either due to good-faith miscommunication or misplaced zealotry for the pro-union cause. They may have been content with getting students’ signatures—the legal requirement. But if this is true, they did not build consensus around unionization nor respect their fellow students enough to ensure that they meant what they signed.
Similarly, the HGSU-UAW’s appeal of the first election results was perfectly legal, but it was done disrespectfully, without regard to decorum or decency. Bringing a union to campus should be done with broad consensus—a consensus that the authorization campaign arguably implied, but the first election results clearly showed did not exist. Without consensus, unionization becomes coercive, as all members of the bargaining unit are required to contribute to the union and allow it to advocate on their behalf. Nevertheless, with the declared support of only 37 percent support of eligible voters, the organizers brazenly continued advocating for unionization and, in a series of NLRB hearings, won the right to a second election.
Thus, with the HGSU-UAW walking on a legal tightrope, the second election was held, with 1,931 voting in favor, 1,523 against, and 1,594 not voting.  Despite having only won with a minority (38 percent) of students’ support, the organizers treated the result as a triumph, cooing in a press release: “This has been an incredibly long haul, and we are so energized by this vote ... We are confident that our union will be good for us and good for the University.” The organizers have doubled down on this tone-deaf presumption in the weeks after the election; there have been no serious efforts to engage with the many students who voted against unionization, only calls to become a union member and participate in the process of electing a bargaining committee.
This arrogance is also visible in the union’s communication with the bargaining unit, in which the organizers consistently use the first person plural possessive, as in: “our union,” “our election,” “our Bargaining Committee,” and “our contract.” Directed toward students who have not become union members, this language is nonsensical and yet distasteful, as it brushes aside the individual’s choice of whether or not to join. (Though all students are required to financially support the union, there is no requirement to actually join it, which would include membership in the national UAW organization).
The HGSU-UAW rushes on, but for it to be a durable institution that brings meaningful, positive change to Harvard, it must start thinking beyond the merely legal. It must work with as much energy at bringing all voices from the bargaining unit together as it did in organizing the election. It must start to show respect for all student workers, particularly those who opposed unionization. Finally, it must act with more self-awareness, acknowledging that a majority of students did not desire unionization and many likely will not become members. The organizers’ conduct during the unionization process does not engender high expectations, but there is still a chance for the union to start asking: “Is it good?”

The Boston Zoning Commission voted last month to approve zoning regulations for recreational marijuana businesses in Boston, marking a milestone in the ongoing legalization of recreational sales in Boston.
Among other things, the new regulations permit businesses to sell on the main streets of Boston and in any of the city’s business districts, but prohibit marijuana dispensaries from opening within a half mile of one another or within 500 feet of existing elementary or high schools.
“Municipalities play a significant role—in fact, the most critical role—in terms of allowing this industry to take root or not,” said Jay A. Youmans, a principal at Smith, Costello, and Crawford, a law group that represents marijuana firms. “This is a really big deal and should be noted, both by the industry and Boston residents, but also by other municipal leaders across the Commonwealth that are still figuring out what they want to do.”
While Massachusetts law mandates that the recreational marijuana industry must be state-licensed, municipalities have the power to create their own zoning laws. Chairman of the Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission Steven J. Hoffman said the state will not issue licenses to businesses that do not adhere to their municipality’s rules.
“We’re issuing the licenses, but we cannot and will not issue licenses unless all those municipal requirements are met,” Hoffman said.
Currently, over 190 municipalities in Massachusetts have put restrictions on marijuana operators; either by outright banning the sale of recreational marijuana or by enacting moratoria on the opening of marijuana dispensaries until the municipality has established zoning rules. Cambridge has not yet established zoning rules for recreational marijuana sales.
Youmans said that, by establishing zoning rules, Boston is breaking with a larger trend across the Commonwealth in which cities have chosen to restrict the sale of recreational marijuana.
“The biggest hurdle for this new industry has really been the municipalities,” he said. “For a state of 6.8 million people, to have its largest municipality take a leadership role in aggressively passing zoning in time for the June 1 launch of this industry really shows some leadership on the part of Mayor Walsh.”
Though Boston’s zoning rules will ensure that dispensaries can open starting on June 1, some have criticized the regulations for being too restrictive.
In an emailed statement, Joseph T. Gilmore, outreach director of the Massachusetts Recreational Consumer Council, specifically criticized the half-mile and school buffer rules.
“The 500 feet buffer from schools and half mile distance from other marijuana establishments limits the amount of available spaces within the city, restricting entrepreneurs who aren’t financially backed from finding an affordable location,” he wrote. “We believe marijuana zoning in Boston should be no more restrictive than locations that allow the sale of alcohol, as it has been proven to be a much safer alternative for adults.”
Gina Physic, an assistant director of media relations and public affairs at the Boston Planning & Development Agency, wrote in an email that these regulations are an extension of Boston’s already-existing medical marijuana zoning rules.
“The zoning language approved follows the state's guidance on buffer zones around schools and is an extension of the City of Boston's existing zoning for medical marijuana,” she wrote. “It will promote wider distribution of these new establishments so they are not clustered in certain neighborhoods.”
Youmans also said he believes the zoning regulations are imperfect. But he said that, overall, he believes the regulations comprise a step in the right direction for the recreational marijuana industry in Massachusetts.
“I think over time—let's give it a couple years—as these things start getting sited and permitted, I think this is something that probably the city will have to re-explore,” Youmans said of the regulations. “But I think that that’s a real sidenote in comparison to the headline here, which is Boston did something really positive as it relates to the cannabis industry.”

After receiving compensation for disruption caused by a months-long construction project, some residents of the Harvard-owned apartment complex Holden Green say they hope to work with the University’s newly formed graduate student union to change the way Harvard University Housing interacts with graduate student tenants.
The residents of Holden Green first engaged with University Housing last fall when they filed a complaint regarding the construction project. Some residents felt they had not been properly informed about the extent of the project, which they said created “constant” noise, excessive debris, and a “dangerous” environment, especially for disabled residents and families with young children.
Harvard ultimately reimbursed residents three months’ worth of rent.
“We asked for 50 percent reimbursement for the duration of the construction, which was 6 months, so obviously the math is 3 months worth of rent. And they met that demand,” Holden Green tenant Christopher J. Williams said.
Asked about residents’ concerns, Justin Stratman, the managing director of University Housing, wrote in an emailed statement that the Holden Green project formed part of broader ongoing efforts to “maximize the number of units available for Harvard affiliates.”
“Last year’s construction activity at Holden Green caused undue inconvenience and disruption to residents,” Stratman wrote. “It was an extraordinary circumstance as two years’ worth of project scope was attempted to be completed in a single season.”
Some Holden Green tenants said they are pleased and encouraged the University offered rent compensation.
“It showed us that when we work together and we came together as a community and represented the full spectrum of what Harvard students and faculty and staff need to be successful on this campus, they listened,” tenant David F. Cavell said. “And that’s what we’re hoping for moving forward.”
In the wake of their successful appeal to the University, Williams said the community group formed by tenants involved in securing the reimbursement feels the union could help them advocate for their interests and ensure there is “tenant representation” in University Housing decision making processes. Eligible students voted to unionize on April 18 and 19 for the first time in Harvard history. The University agreed last week to bargain with the union.
“We think that the union might be helpful in helping us to replicate what we did here in terms of that organizational capacity, to other University houses, so that all of the folks living in Harvard University Housing could come together as one collective unit,” Williams said.
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers organizer Jack M. Nicoludis wrote in an email that he has met with the group of residents to “discuss how a union could help address the issues they are facing.”
“It’s clear that student workers want to make sure Harvard Housing works for us, and our union can help us have productive conversations with the University to improve the services they offer to their employees,” Nicoludis wrote.
Cavell said the group of Holden Green residents hopes the union’s input can help them enact “systemic change.”
“We all lived in an active construction site and suffered six days a week, eight hours a day, for six months,” Cavell said. ”Going forward, our concern was, ‘Well, how are you going to make sure that this doesn’t happen again?’”

Harvard Business School has updated its Title IX training modules on sexual harassment—mandatory for all incoming first-year students—amid criticisms the trainings inadequately capture scenarios business school students might face.
The online training modules are meant to educate students on sexual harassment and related resources at the school and the University more broadly. Individual schools across Harvard have undertaken efforts in recent years to implement the recommendations of a University-wide task force on sexual assault prevention, which called for mandatory annual trainings.
School administrators made changes to the module earlier this year and allowed members of the Women’s Student Association to preview the updated version. Alexis B. Wolfer, a first-year student and the co-president of the Women’s Student Association at HBS, said she thinks the new module is an improvement but fails to distinguish appropriate behavior from harassment in the scenarios it presents.
Wolfer said the school’s diversity, particularly its large international population, necessitates training that better addresses behavior considered to fall “in the gray.”
“The problem is I think it does a poor job of telling people what’s right and wrong,” she said. “And while it might be obvious for some students and in some communities it might not need to be said, I think that at a university that has such a diverse population, really spelling out what the rules are is really important.”
Wolfer said the WSA was not involved in developing the updated modules, but that the group will continue to advocate for further changes including supplementary training.
“While I think this module is better, it is by no means no way what the WSA was hoping to see change,” she said.
Representatives from the group have met with administrators to discuss additional tweaks to the module.
HBS spokesperson Brian C. Kenny confirmed in an email that the WSA has been pushing for changes to the modules but declined to comment on the details.
“The WSA leadership met with the senior associate dean and executive director of MBA earlier this month to share some feedback they had on the current approach and some ideas for how to improve upon it,” Kenny wrote. “The ideas discussed in that meeting are still in the formative stages so it's too soon for us to share anything.”
Wolfer also led an initiative to redesign stickers in HBS bathrooms that list resources for victims of sexual assault and harassment. She said current stickers display contact information in a way that is “filled with nuances that are very difficult for an untrained eye to understand the difference between them and why under certain circumstances you would call one versus another.”
She said she is optimistic the new stickers, which will be plastered on bathroom stalls this summer, will increase reporting rates of sexual misconduct at HBS.
Wolfer said she would like to see Harvard surpass its peer institutions’ efforts to combat sexual harassment.
“I think that Harvard should also as an institution recognize its privilege and the responsibility of its privilege and be the torchbearer of these changes and not just do the status quo,” she said.

Four thousand dollars worth of music production equipment was stolen from Quad Sound Studios’ basement studio during a party in the Pforzheimer Igloo on March 30 and has yet to be found, according to studio members and University police logs.
The group’s president, Dylan Vartikar-McCullough ’18 said “a plethora of all different types of things went missing.” Vartikar-McCullough said that microphones, computer equipment, chords, and an Ableton Push all were taken from the studios.
The equipment was originally purchased using funds from the Undergraduate Council, donations from music equipment companies, and alumni gifts.
The student-run music studio was founded in the 1980s, underwent a period of inactivity, and recently saw a revival in 2012, but Vartikar-McCullough said the group has never suffered a theft like this before.
“The studio’s policy is to lock up all the equipment and until now they have never had a robbery,” he said. “We've never had any problems, everyone is super friendly and respective of our space.”
Vartikar-McCullough said the group  has been working with the Harvard University Police Department for more than a month to find the missing equipment, but has yet to track any of it down. In the meantime, the group has set up a GoFundMe page to help offset the cost of replacing the missing equipment.
HUPD Public Information Officer Steven G. Catalano did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

Though an undergraduate group has called for a more diverse group of clinicians at the University’s Counseling and Mental Health Services, Chief of CAMHS Barbara Lewis said the agency’s budget currently makes hiring more counselors infeasible.
In the wake of the forcible arrest of a black undergraduate last month, students have pressed for the “expedited hiring” of CAMHS counselors who identify as people of color. Some College students joined together to form the advocacy group Black Students Organizing for Change days after the arrest and released a letter demanding several reforms to University processes they say led to the arrest of the student.
On April 13, Cambridge Police Department officers arrested the undergraduate after a physical confrontation. Harvard University Health Services and Harvard University Police Department were the first to receive calls about the student—who was naked and likely under the influence of narcotics—according to a timeline provided by CPD. HUHS received a call from one of the student’s acquaintances who said he needed medical care. Minutes later, HUHS contacted HUPD, who then notified CPD because the student was not standing on Harvard's campus, meaning he was not under HUPD’s jurisdiction.
In a press conference days after the arrest, Police Commissioner Branville G. Bard Jr. said the student was undergoing evaluation for issues including mental health concerns.
Several of BSOC’s demands target HUHS specifically, including one that asks for the “the expedited hiring of Black and Brown counselors.”
The hiring of new counselors requires more money, however, according to Lewis.
“Budgets are set well ahead of the next academic year,” Lewis said. “Part of the budget is for staffing, so we can’t just take money from office supplies and other line items and say we want to hire staff.”
Currently, Lewis said 13 of the 39 CAMHS staff members come from “various ethnic backgrounds.” In an emailed statement, HUHS spokesperson Michael Perry wrote that CAMHS has also hired an African-American and a Latino counselor this semester.
Lewis said that one CAMHS staff member will be retiring, which could give CAMHS the opportunity to further diversify its staff.
“We do have one clinician retiring so we will definitely be recruiting for someone to fill that position and that will be one of our criteria—to build on our diversity,” Lewis said.
Some students also said during a town hall after the arrest that the student-to-counselor ratio at the agency is too high and that wait times for CAMHS appointments are too long.
CAMHS recently piloted a new model of care which aims to reduce the time gap between the moment a student requests an appointment and the moment the student is seen by a counselor to 48 hours. A CAMHS employee is then supposed to schedule an initial 30-minute session with the student.
“With the new pilot, we have been able to see or talk to students within five days, and our target is then to try to see 80 percent of the students within two days. I think with our pilot, we’re actually doing very well,” Lewis said. “I think if a student called a clinician in the community, it’s rare that you would get an appointment within that week or even two weeks.”
CAMHS internal coordinator and clinician Brandin Dear, who matches students with counselors after this initial 30-minute appointment, said he has been able to fulfill requests for students who ask to meet with a certain type of counselor.
“If for some reason, they have a different preference—and that might mean they want to see a clinician of color, that might mean they want to see a particular gender of a clinician—then they'll get referred to me,” Dear said. “I think we have done a good job of when we’re getting specific requests, to be able to fulfill those requests.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council debuted a revamped website Monday, which UC leaders say will serve as a resource compendium for students and will better allow undergraduates to hold the body to its promises.
An overhaul of the Council’s website formed a key campaign promise of UC President Catherine L Zhang ’19 and Vice President Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 in fall 2017. Boucher said he began working on the website in December, but said multiple delays—including a prolonged back-and-forth with Harvard University Information Technology—pushed back the site’s launch.
The new website features what Zhang and Boucher call “progress bars,” which they say will allow students to keep track of the pair's 39 original campaign goals.
“It marks a huge change, as we are keeping up with the times and making sure that all information is up-to-date, easily accessible, and centralized,” Zhang said in an interview Tuesday.
Zhang said the progress bars on the new website will help broadcast to the student body the initiatives the UC is pursuing.
“Oftentimes you don’t hear about initiatives until they come they come to completion,” she said.  “At the end of the day, we are always working towards everything, you just might not see it.”
Boucher said Tuesday that UC leaders are continuing to add material to the website, including links to various mental health and sexual assault response resources.
“We want to make sure that... the information is both accurate and as comprehensive as we can make it,” he said. “We are making sure to reach out to every interest group on campus for which we want to publish resources.”
Boucher added that what he called the “decentralized” nature of the University can at times mean students are unaware of various resources Harvard offers.
“We believe that Harvard actually has a tremendous amount of information that is published online across all of its many different divisions and organizations, but locating that information can be difficult,” Boucher said. “What we aim to do is bring all of that information together, not necessarily by providing new information, but by letting our website act as a hub to connect to other resources that exist online.”
The launch of the revamped website comes a little over a week after the Council’s website was briefly hacked by a group calling itself the “Iran Cyber Security Group”—and a few days after The Crimson reported a previous version of the UC's site left voting records editable by all College students for months. Boucher said Tuesday the platform of the website is “more comprehensive” than the previous iteration.
“The new website is built upon a technical framework that I believe is significantly more secure than the previous framework,” he said. “The framework... offers a little bit more enterprise-level security as opposed to personal-level security that we saw with our old website.”

This is the fifth installment in a five-part series analyzing the results of The Crimson’s survey of the more than 1,000 members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard’s flagship faculty. Read the first installment here, the second installment here, the third installment here, and the fourth installment here.
Roughly half of faculty in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences are neither satisfied nor dissatisfied with the choice of Lawrence S. Bacow as Harvard’s next president, according to a survey of the faculty conducted by The Harvard Crimson.
Another roughly half of surveyed professors indicated they view the choice to place Bacow in Massachusetts Hall’s corner office with some degree of satisfaction. Asked whether Bacow should continue or veer from the policies of his predecessor University President Drew G. Faust, a plurality of respondents—representing slightly more than a third of survey takers—called for change.
The search committee charged with selecting Harvard’s 29th president announced Bacow as their pick in February following a highly secretive nine-month process. Bacow, a former president of Tufts University, sat on the search committee in his capacity as a member of the Harvard Corporation. He quietly recused himself from the committee—comprising Corporation members and three members of the Board of Overseers—in December to become a candidate. Bacow will take office after Faust steps down at the end of June.
The Crimson conducted a survey of Harvard’s flagship faculty over the course of two weeks in mid-April 2018. The results paint a picture of how the more than 1,000 members of FAS think about key University policies, life at Harvard, and the national political climate.
The fifth and final installment of The Crimson's faculty survey series examines how professors view Bacow and what they see as the biggest challenges he is likely to face as he prepares to assume arguably the most high-profile job in higher education.
The Crimson reweighted data reported in this story by respondents' ladder status and divisional affiliation (see below for methodology).
Surveyed faculty were evenly split between those who felt indifferent and those who felt pleased with Bacow's selection—roughly 46 percent reported they felt "neither satisfied nor dissatisfied" while another 46 percent indicated they felt either "slightly," "moderately," or "extremely satisfied" with the pick.
A very small percentage of surveyed faculty indicated they are dissatisfied with Harvard's final choice; approximately 3 percent reported feeling slightly dissatisfied, 4 percent reported feeling moderately dissatisfied, and 1 percent reported feeling extremely dissatisfied.
Of surveyed professors who reported their divisional affiliations, those hailing from the Social Sciences were most likely to rate Bacow favorably overall. Just over 19 percent of respondents in that group indicated they are “extremely satisfied” with his selection. 
When asked what they believe Bacow should prioritize as he assumes office, more than half of faculty respondents said “maintaining academic excellence” should fall at the top of his to-do list. Just over 16 percent of respondents responded that improving Harvard’s diversity should be the president's premium priority. No faculty members indicated that implementing the College’s social group sanctions should comprise Bacow’s first priority.
Male respondents overwhelmingly saw academic excellence as a priority—more than 60 percent selected this option—while 25 percent of female respondents chose diversity as their top issue. About 11 percent of males did the same.
Those who reported an affiliation with the Arts and Humanities and Social Sciences were more likely to select improving diversity than were faculty who reported an affiliation with other divisions. Further, respondents who identified as tenured professors were more than 25 percent less likely than were self-identified tenure-track professors to prioritize improving diversity.
Asked whether, in general, they would prefer to see Bacow stay the course on Faust’s policies and priorities or change direction, a plurality of faculty respondents—39 percent— voted for change. Thirty-three percent voted for continuation and 28 percent reported no opinion.
Asked what they believe to be the biggest challenge facing Bacow as he enters office, nearly 55 percent of respondents pointed to the political climate in the United States.
National attitudes toward higher education have soured in recent years, with a Pew Research Center study in July 2017 indicating that 58 percent of Republicans believed that universities had a negative impact on the country. In December, congressional Republicans passed a tax on endowment returns for certain universities, including Harvard, as part of a sweeping tax overhaul. The tax would have cost the University $43 million if it had taken effect during the 2017 fiscal year. Faust lobbied extensively against this tax prior to the vote, and she is now backing draft legislation that would repeal it.
One of Bacow’s first responsibilities as president will be selecting a new dean for FAS. The current dean, Michael D. Smith, announced plans in March to step down once Bacow identifies a successor. Nearly 38 percent of faculty survey respondents reported believing Smith’s replacement should prioritize diversifying faculty hires. More than half of self-identified tenure-track and non-ladder faculty respondents said this should form the new dean’s top priority.
Overall, few respondents reported viewing the expansion of SEAS into Allston in 2020 as a pressing concern for the next FAS dean. No faculty who reported an affiliation with the Social Sciences indicated this should be the dean's top priority. Forty percent of faculty who reported an affiliation with the SEAS division also labeled the Allston move a priority for the next dean.
The new SEAS complex is scheduled to open in 2020. The University has already begun adjusting class schedules and determining transit options to move students between Cambridge to Boston for classes.
Presidential searches have historically served as turning points and moments of institutional reflection at Harvard. During the search for number 29, committee members sent emails soliciting input from more than 375,000 people, individually consulted 250 people, and worked with three advisory committees comprising students, faculty, and staff to inform its priorities and candidate list.
The overwhelming majority of faculty who responded to The Crimson’s survey—nearly three quarters—reported they were not personally consulted during the presidential search. Of those who indicated the search committee reached out to them, 45 percent identified themselves as affiliated with the Social Sciences division, while only 8 percent identified themselves as affiliated with the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Nearly 60 percent of the people who reported being contacted indicated they are tenured professors, while 75 percent of self-identified tenure-track professors and nearly 88 percent of self-identified non-ladder faculty members indicated they were not personally consulted by the search committee.
Asked whether they believed the University's presidential search process was sufficiently transparent, more than half of surveyed faculty reported feeling neutral. Search committee members maintained strict secrecy throughout the hunt for Faust's successor.
The Harvard Crimson collected electronic responses through the Qualtrics survey platform from April 17 to April 30, 2018. A link to the anonymous survey was sent to 1,173 FAS and SEAS faculty members through emails sourced from Harvard directory information and departmental websites.
Of those faculty who received emails, 516 accessed the link to the survey. A total of 498 participants answered at least one question, and 296 participants completed every question in the survey. To prevent participants from accidentally taking the survey more than once, The Crimson enabled Qualtrics’ browser cookie functionality to register unique survey sessions on each device. This device data is controlled by Qualtrics, and The Crimson does not retain information that could identify devices accessing the survey with anonymous responses.
In an effort to check for response bias, The Crimson compared respondent demographics with publicly available information on faculty demographics provided by the University—information regarding gender, minority background, divisional affiliation, and ladder versus non-ladder status. Overall, respondent demographics tracked with faculty demographics.
Of survey respondents who identified themselves as ladder faculty, 34.5 percent were women and 16.2 percent were minorities. Based on data in the 2017 FAS Dean’s Annual report, women and minorities make up 29.9 percent and 21.9 percent of FAS ladder faculty, respectively.
The Crimson previously reported that, in May 2015, 28.9 percent of the FAS were non-ladder faculty. By contrast, 42 percent of respondents to The Crimson’s survey identified themselves as non-ladder faculty.
Of faculty with known divisional affiliations who were sent links to the survey, 317—or 28.5 percent—are affiliated with the Arts and Humanities, 341—or 30.6 percent—with the Social Sciences, 316—or 28.4 percent—with the Sciences, and 140—or 12.6 percent—with SEAS. In comparison, of respondents who indicated their divisional affiliation on the survey, 39.9 percent reported an affiliation with the Arts and Humanities, 27.8 with the Social Sciences, 28.26 percent with the Sciences, and 7 percent with SEAS.
The Crimson reweighted all responses by ladder status and divisional affiliation—the two demographic categories which saw the most significant areas of response discrepancy. These reweightings did not produce any changes greater than plus or minus 2.5 percent from the unadjusted percentages.
Separately adjusting by gender or minority background yielded no changes greater than plus or minus 0.7 percent to the unadjusted percentages. Therefore, The Crimson did not reweight responses by these two categories. The data reported in the main body of the story thus does not include any reweightings for gender or minority background.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard researchers—using zebrafish and frog embryos as models—have traced the process by which a single cell builds a complete organism, according to three papers published April 26 in "Science" magazine.
The research was conducted by Molecular and Cellular Biology Professor Alexander F. Schier, Harvard Medical School Systems Biology Assistant Professor Allon M. Klein, Harvard Medical School Systems Biology Department Chair Marc W. Kirschner, members of their respective labs, and Harvard Medical School Associate Systems Biology Professor Sean G. Megason at the Broad Institute in Cambridge.
“The project, at the highest conceptual level, was asking the question, ‘What happens to gene expression in all of the cells in an embryo over time?’” said James A. Briggs, a member of Klein’s lab. “The state of affairs previously was that we knew a lot about gene expression in terms of what a couple of genes did, but we didn’t know what all of the genes were doing in each individual cell.”
Briggs said the researchers utilized an innovative single-cell RNA sequencing technology developed by Klein to map the process of cell differentiation in pluripotent cells, cells that have the potential to develop into specialized cells that, in turn, comprise specific tissues.
Jeffrey A. Farrell, a researcher in Schier’s lab, said that, in this technique, an embryo is first dissociated into individual cells, which are then suspended in solution. The solution of cells is combined with a solution of beads, each of which is encoded with a unique “barcode” and contains primers that can capture RNA. A buffer is then added to break open the cells and release their RNA content, which is captured by the beads.
“Each bead’s unique barcode, when you sequence the RNA, lets you know that those came from this cell versus the ones that came from a different bead,” Farrell said. “All of your RNAs are attached to things with unique barcodes, so you can then turn them into DNA and put them in a sequencer to get the sequence of all the things that are in that cell.”
Farrell said that, though the three projects utilized slightly different methodologies, the initiatives shared a common goal and sought to answer the same core question.
“Essentially, all three studies did something similar,” Farrell said. “They took embryos from different time points, dissociated them, sequenced a number of the different cells, and then came up with different computational ways of trying to arrange them into these paths from a pluripotent state to differentiated cell types.”
Farrell said the studies have numerous applications in the field of regenerative medicine. He said that—in one example—a comprehensive map of gene expression on the cellular level can help scientists better understand how cells decide their fate.
Schier Lab researcher Yiqun Wang added that other researchers can take new approaches to analyzing the data sets used in the three studies, potentially leading to more breakthroughs.
“Just simply by offering this data set to the field, other people can look into it and maybe extract more information and understand more about development,” Wang said. “And of course understanding more about the process of development would have some implications on treating developmental diseases.”
Briggs echoed Wang’s optimism.
“There are two things that we’re really excited about doing right now. One is applying the same kind of approaches to other organisms to learn about evolution,” he said. “The other thing we’re really excited about doing is using this really detailed map as kind of a reference, so now when we change how certain genes work, we can ask, on a really global level, what that means for development in an embryo.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 9, 2018 at 7:05 p.m.
Two organizations led in part by members of Harvard’s single-gender social groups spent a total of $90,000 in the first quarter of 2018 lobbying around legislation that could imperil the College’s ability to enforce its social group sanctions, according to publicly available filings.
One of the two groups—the Cambridge Coalition, comprising Greek organizations and final clubs including the Fly Club, the AD Club, and the Porcellian Club—formed in recent months specifically to fight Harvard’s sanctions. The other, the Fraternal Government Relations Coalition, includes fraternity and sorority umbrella organizations the North American Interfraternity Conference and the National Panhellenic Conference, as well as the Fraternity and Sorority Political Action Committee.
The College’s sanctions—which took effect with the Class of 2021—bar members of unrecognized single-gender social groups from holding student group leadership positions, varsity athletic team captaincies, and from receiving College endorsement for prestigious fellowships.
The PROSPER Act, a piece of legislation meant as an update to the Higher Education Act, contains a provision that could force the University to choose between its sanctions and millions of dollars in federal research funding. Graduate and undergraduate members of single-gender social groups have mobilized to lobby members of Congress in favor of the bill.
Though the PROSPER Act in its current form likely does not affect Harvard, some social group affiliates hope to change the wording of an amendment to the act to render the legislation applicable to the University.
The Cambridge Coalition spent $40,000 in the first quarter of 2018 lobbying around “issues related to the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act.” In that same time period, public filings show FGRC spent $50,000 lobbying around the PROSPER Act. The first quarter stretches from Jan. 1 to March 31.
Both the Cambridge Coalition and FGRC have engaged the law firm Arnold & Porter to help conduct their lobbying efforts, according to public records. Arnold & Porter employee Kevin O’Neill serves as the main lobbyist for both groups.
For at least one member of FGRC—FSPAC—activity around the PROSPER Act matches a pattern. The PAC is the premier political arm for Greek groups in the United States. Established in 2005, FSPAC has long sought to influence higher education laws; the group added a member of the Porcellian Club to its 2017-18 board of directors.
In 2017, FSPAC donated more than $20,000 to three key legislators involved in crafting, introducing, or supporting the PROSPER Act, according to public records.
Publicly available documents show FSPAC gave $22,000 of the total $160,000 it donated to senators and representatives in 2017 to three Republican legislators: Representatives Virginia Foxx, Elise M. Stefanik ’06, and Brett Guthrie, all of whom helped draft the PROSPER Act. Foxx introduced the act and Guthrie penned the amendment that could imperil Harvard’s ability to enforce its sanctions. The Crimson reported in Dec. 2018 that Stefanik is particularly pushing for the social group amendment.
Foxx and Guthrie each received $10,000, while Stefanik got $2,000, according to the documents.
Harvard, too, has weighed in on the discussions surrounding the PROSPER Act. University President Drew G. Faust recently penned a letter to Stefanik laying out her concerns with the legislation and unsuccessfully sought to meet with the congresswoman on a recent visit to D.C. The University has spent $160,000 lobbying in the first quarter of 2018; some of that went to activity around the PROSPER Act.
FSPAC gave significantly more money to representatives than to senators in 2017: $30,500 to senators and $129,500 to representatives, the documents show. While the PROSPER Act has successfully passed the House committee that reviewed it, the Senate has yet to publicly release its version of the bill.
Representatives who received FSPAC donations include members of the Committee on Education and the Workforce, the committee that drafted the PROSPER Act bill and voted to pass it in Dec. 2017. Committee members Marcia L. Fudge, Bradley Byrne, Luke Messer, Todd Rokita, Frederica S. Wilson, Joe Wilson, and Rick W. Allen received a total of $19,000 from FSPAC in 2017, according to the documents.
The documents also show the PAC donated a total of $2,000 to Senator Doug Jones and Senator Todd Young, two members of the Senate’s Committee on Health, Education, Labor, & Pensions—the Senate committee that will oversee the drafting of the Senate’s version of the PROSPER Act.
FGRC began lobbying Congress around issues related to Greek organizations years prior to the introduction of the PROSPER Act. FSPAC also launched advocacy efforts more than half a decade ago; in 2012, the PAC opposed a bill that would revoke federal financial aid from anyone found responsible for hazing by a college or university.
FSPAC previously lobbied for an act that would have amended the tax code to make gifts to fraternities and sororities fully tax deductible.
This article has been revised to reflect the following corrections:
CORRECTION: May 9, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that the Fraternity and Sorority Political Action Committee had lobbied Congress in 2017 and 2018. In fact, FSPAC forms part of a group, the Fraternal Government Relations Coalition, that lobbied Congress; FSPAC did not itself lobby. Though FSPAC donated money to various senators and representatives, those donations on their own do not fit the specific legal definition of lobbying. 
CORRECTION: May 9, 2018
Due to an editing error, a previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that the documents revealing the identities of specific senators and representatives to whom FSPAC donated funds in 2017 and 2018 were private documents. In fact, the documents are public.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Christian Union—the parent group for Harvard College Faith and Action, a campus Christian fellowship currently on year-long "administrative probation"—reported over $600,000 in expenditures for HCFA, according to Christian Union’s 2017 annual report.
The spending disclosures come as HCFA is facing the possibility it may have to disaffiliate from Christian Union in order to end its probation and regain recognition from the College.
Administrators placed HCFA on probation roughly two months ago, stating the group had “conducted itself in a manner grossly inconsistent” with Harvard’s rules for recognized student groups—including the College's non-discrimination policy. The Crimson reported in Feb. 2018 that Harvard's decision to punish HCFA was almost certainly tied to the group's move to demote an assistant bible course leader after she entered into a same-sex relationship.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane said in February HCFA would need to sever ties with Christian Union in order to re-earn recognition from the College at the end of its year-long administrative probation. 
Christian Union—a national organization that supports religious groups at all eight Ivy League schools and Stanford—currently provides HCFA with resources, funding, and salaries for ministry fellows who lead Bible courses; on its website, HCFA refers to Christian Union as its “parent ministry.”
The financial support Christian Union reported providing to HCFA in fiscal year 2017 lags behind only the sums it gave to Columbia and Princeton’s campus student ministries.
Christian Union reported providing $683,247 in funding to HCFA for fiscal year 2017; the group gave Columbia $822,497 and Princeton $1,271,436 in that same period.
Princeton’s ministry—founded in 2002—is the first university group ever established by Christian Union. Harvard’s chapter was founded in 2008 and is the second university group Christian Union formed.
The 2017 totals match the amount of financial support Christian Union provided in previous years, according to the group's annual reports. Christian Union reported giving HCFA $673,608 in fiscal year 2016, $731,050 in fiscal year 2015, and $709,180 in fiscal year 2014.
Though the Office of Student Life stated in March that the religious group’s probation did not automatically bar them from College funding, the Undergraduate Council independently voted to ban HCFA from receiving UC funding in March.
To date, HCFA’s probation has had few other immediate practical effects. The group has continued to use Yenching Auditorium—a Harvard-owned space—for its weekly worship event, Doxa. HCFA operated a table at the Visitas Activities Fair for admitted students. A group of students held an “emergency” meeting Friday to discuss ways to pressure the College to enforce stricter penalties on HCFA.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three seconds is forever in the 4x400-meter relay. But as Columbia learned, not enough to keep Gabby Thomas as bay, and not even when you field an Olympian.
In the 2017 Ivy League Indoor Heptagonal Championships, when the Crimson won the women’s event by a four-second margin, the Harvard Athletics’ website deemed the performance “dominant.” Over a year and two Heps wins in the event later—one in the 2017 outdoors and again in the 2018 indoors—junior co-captain Thomas was given the baton in the final leg of the 2018 Outdoor 4x400-meter final, down 2.8 seconds and in fourth place.
With about 30 meters between her and Columbia’s Akua Obeng-Akrofi—a 2016 Olympian for team Ghana and semifinalist in the Commonwealth Games—Thomas wasn’t even the Ivy League Network’s frame as the camera panned to Obeng-Akrofi rounding her turn. Then Thomas jumped to second.
The shot shifted to focus in on the duo, Thomas and Obeng-Akrofi—indoor national champ and Olympian—Obeng-Akrofi desperately trying not to relinquish her lead. Every second though, the gap between the two shrank, Thomas edging ever closer.
“Down 2.8 seconds—all I was thinking about was catching her,” Thomas said. “I didn’t know how many meters away she was, especially seeing as Penn’s track is configured differently than most, so it was just strategy of catching her and securing the win in the 4x4. That’s all I could think about when I was running.”
As the pair rounded the final turn, Thomas nipped at Obeng-Akrofi’s heels. The finish line drew near. Thomas leaned forward, crossing .04 seconds before her competitor. It wasn’t that Obeng-Akrofi had run a slow lap, it was just that Thomas’ 400-meter split was 49.44 seconds—over two seconds faster than the meet record in the 400-meter individual event, a race Thomas didn’t run. The margin of victory between Columbia and the next best finisher, Brown, was just under four seconds.
This victory was one of nine first place medals for Harvard at the 2018 Ivy League Heptagonal Championships, six of which were won in individual events and three in teams. Overall, the women’s team earned second place over the two-day meet, while the men’s team placed sixth. Racing at Penn’s historic Franklin Field, the results mirrored that of the Indoor Heptagonal Championships earlier in the season.
“[We had] a lot of great performances so I’m really proud of the girls,” Thomas said. “We were down in numbers compared to Penn but we knew this going in, so I’m proud that everyone was able to go and fight hard anyway. Lots of PRs and a lot to be proud of even if we got second.”
THE FLORENCE FLASH
Thomas highlighted the weekend, racking up a total of five gold medals for her second consecutive year, one for every event in which she competed. Likewise, the results were good enough to earn her Most Outstanding Track Performer of the Meet for the second consecutive season. Both Thomas and sophomore Simi Fajemisin shared the Most Outstanding Field Performer of the Meet award with Penn’s Ashley Anumba.
As a result of her efforts, Thomas—a Florence, Mass., native—was also named USTFCCCA National Athlete of the Week. The honor marks the first time a Crimson athlete has earned the award since Courtney Smith did so in 2016.
“It’s such an honor to be acknowledged for all of the hard work I put in,” Thomas said. “Especially being from Harvard, a lot of athletes are overlooked. So it is such a great feeling to be recognized because people just don’t see the hard work, just the results. I’m incredibly grateful and so appreciative.”
While the Harvard duo shared the award after the competition, they shared the podium during with both earning spots in long jump. Thomas placed first with a 6.61-meter leap, enough for a new program record, while Fajemisin claimed bronze in 6.01-meter jump. The podium was a familiar place for these two as they did the same thing in 2017, only then Fajemisin placed second, edging out Dartmouth’s Cha’Mia Rothwell. Rothwell this year placed second.
The women’s 100-meter dash final featured four Crimson sprinters: Thomas, freshman Olivia Okoli, junior Ngozi Musa and sophomore Micah Meekins. The junior co-captain found the finish first in 11.27 seconds while Okoli and Musa finished in fourth and sixth, respectively, earning points for Harvard’s total. Sophomore Micah Meekins finished at seventh in 12.07 seconds.
Many of the same faces ran in the 200-meter dash final, among them Thomas, Meekins and Okoli. Thomas grabbed another gold in the event, setting a meet record with a 22.76 first place finish. Meekins claimed third while Okoli placed seventh.
Thomas’ other two gold medals came from relays. In the 4x100-meter relay, Musa, Thomas, sophomore Karina Joiner and Okoli earned the top spot for the Crimson, finishing in 45.16 seconds. The second relay, the 4x400-meter, finished in 3:36.35 and featured sophomore Maya Miklos, Okoli, Joiner and Thomas in the rear. Harvard has now won the event at every one of the last four Heptagonal championships.
PLAYING THE FIELD
Aside from Thomas’ triumphs, the Crimson was successful in the field events of the meet. Mostly taking place on Saturday, with a few carrying over into the second day of competition, Harvard found three gold medals in these events.
Fajemisin repeated her trip to the podium with a first place finish in triple jump. The sophomore leapt 13.00 meters to her third consecutive Ivy League championship. In fact, the only Heps meet during her collegiate career which Fajemisin was not the Ancient Eight champ was the indoor meet of her freshman year. In that meet, she placed second by .03 meters, a jump that broke previous 16-year record in the event. Prior to Fajemisin, the furthest anyone had jumped while wearing the Crimson H was 12.79 meters.
 Senior Andrew Connolly earned a gold medal of his own in the javelin throw with a 61.74-meter toss on his sixth attempt. This victory represents the second consecutive year that Harvard has stood atop the podium for the event with Brett Henderson taking gold in 2017.
“Being able to win an Ivy championship my senior year, and in my final track meet ever, was a pretty special experience,” Connolly said. “I battled with injuries for much of my time at Harvard, so being able to get healthy and compete to my best ability in my senior season was all I could have asked for.”
Then the Crimson turned to pole vault. On the men’s side, Erick Duffy showed his continual improvement by clearing 5.26 meters to earn a silver medal and etch his name into the Harvard record books with the second best jump in program history. For the women, co-captain Marlena Sabatino placed fourth with a 3.71-meter vault.
RUN FAST, TURN LEFT
The women’s 4x400-meter relay wasn’t the only relay taking golds, as the men’s variant earned its way to the podium in a much less dramatic fashion—beating the next closest competitor by a second and a half. Represented by freshman Rodney Agyare-May, junior co-captain Myles Marshall, freshman Jovahn Williamson and senior Matt Hurst, the group won the event in 3:09.52 seconds with Princeton falling to second.
Three of the quartet advanced to the final in the individual 400-meter dash. Only Marshall absent, all three of the others qualified for the finals with qualifying times in the top four. Williamson clocked the fastest speed in the field of 19 on Saturday and rode that momentum all the way to gold medal at the end of the day on Sunday. Finishing his lap in 47.03, Williamson clocked a school record in the event. Hurst sprinted at his heels, finishing in 47.33 seconds, a personal record and enough for a second place finish on the afternoon. Agyare-May finished in fourth in 47.57 seconds.
“I feel like my performance shows all the hard work that my teammates and I have been putting in this whole season,” Williamson said. “We have worked hard and pushed each other every day in practice for the last eight months, and I believe our results are indicative of that work.”
Marshall, however, ran in the 800-meter race. The junior co-captain ran the second fastest qualifying time on Saturday in 1:49.31. Dropping seven hundredths of a second, Marshall finished the finals race in fourth place, adding to the Crimson’s point total.
The other co-captain, Jay Hebert, also earned fourth on the day. Racing in the 110-meter hurdles, the 14.25-second finish was enough for spot number four on the podium.
Also in hurdles, Joiner arrived in Philadelphia ready to set records. In Saturday’s qualifying races, the sophomore finished the 100-meter hurdles in 13.54 seconds, the second fastest time in program history and her personal best. She bested that time the next day, sprinting to a silver place finish in 13.38 seconds, a program best. Sophomore Livia Gauntlett finished the same race at fourth, in 13.57 seconds.
In the 400-meter hurdles, Joiner broke another personal record en route to her second place finish in 58.86 seconds. Sophomore Maya Miklos finished third with a personal record of her own at 59.85 seconds.
Among the crowded field of long distance racers, two Harvard athletes climbed the podium. In the women’s 1500-meter, junior Kathryn Gillespie earned second place after finishing in 4:22.68 seconds. Freshman Hugo Milner raced in the 5000-meter event and placed sixth. Completing the race in 14:21.78, Milner was the top freshman finisher on the evening.
“As a [men’s] team overall I feel that our results did not show our true potential,” Williamson said. “We were missing a lot of key players going into the meet and did not finish as high as we would have liked, but there were many performances at the meet that show our team is moving in the right direction.”
By virtue of finishing top two in their respective events, 15 Crimson athletes earned All-Ivy honors following the meet. Five earned multiple honors. With her five Heps titles, Thomas was named first team All-Ivy five times. Joiner earned four total mentions as a member of both top finishing women’s relays and her silvers in the 100 and 400-meter hurdle events. Also as a member of both victorious relays, Okoli earned two first team nods. For the men, Williamson earned multiple mentions for his gold in the 400-meter dash and his part in the 4x400 relay.
