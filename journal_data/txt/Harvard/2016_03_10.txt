BEST SINGING: CABOT
“Hello from the shuttle ride.”
A giant fish stares stoically out of a Cabot House window as Stephanie Johnson ’18 kills it on the vocals. Not many people can do Adele’s “Hello” justice, but Johnson and the Quad Sound Studios make Cabot’s “Hello” iTunes-worthy. Those quadded can comfort themselves during the interminable shuttle rides by listening to this Housing Day video on repeat.

BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY: DUNSTER
“The house. It’s calling to you.”
“Dunster Wars: The House Awakens” opens with a scenic view of Dunster House surrounded by the deserts of the fictional planet Tatooine. A ridiculously high-quality camera weaves through newly renovated rooms and shoots Dunster activities from unique angles. The sound is clear, the editing is superb, and the transitions between scenes are flawless. This might be the most professional Housing Day video on YouTube right now. We’re anticipating that the full version will soon be coming to a theater near you.

BEST CAMEO: WINTHROP
“All we do is win, win, win, in Winthrop.”
How did Winthrop get Ben S. Bernanke ‘75, 14th chairman of the Federal Reserve, in their video? More importantly, how did they get him to say “I’m retired now, but I can reassure you that Winthrop House is money in the bank” with a straight face? We’re just as bewildered as you are, both by Winthrop’s apparently excellent persuasive skills and by the way Bernanke stares deadpan into the camera without even a hint of a smile.

BEST MASCOT: ELIOT
“Is it too late to get Eliot?”
As it turns out, a huge elephant trunk opens up a whole new world of dancing possibilities, a fact that the Eliot elephant showcases well in their 2016 Housing Day video. This dancing elephant makes its way through the Eliot gates, woodshop, and library with an unforgettable amount of sass, spirit, and energy.

BEST PARODY: QUINCY
“Quincy river house. Major key.”
Shooting an entire four minute Housing Day video through Snapchat is ambitious, but Quincy pulls it off by parodying social media’s beloved D.J. Khaled. Viewers are reminded of the important things in life, like “cookies, sunshine [and] Quincy happiness!” What’s the key to success? Watch the Quincy Housing Day video and find out.

“I have a problem with people being sensitive f***s. Do I have white pride? F*** yeah I do… Do I think Adolf Hitler was a genuinely good person? F*** no. But I also don't give a shit if someone does… Don't be such a sensitive and defenseless person.”
It started out pretty simple. A friend of mine—a nice enough guy in high school—posted a picture of the Confederate flag on his timeline. I commented on his post. And then we came to the classic standoff: the liberty-centered conservative commenting on “un-American” identity politics and limits to freedom of speech vs. the “edgy white liberal” challenger.
Unfortunately, the conversation continued on and on and on until it ended up obeying Godwin’s Internet Law: “As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches one.”
And, finally, we arrived at the not-so-pretty paragraph above, written by a friend of a friend, whom I had never met before.
Facebook arguments can end up that way sometimes. A provocative post leads to a flurry of mini-paragraph arguments in the comment section. By the end, you throw up your hands, look to the ceiling, and scream: “How does Jimmy from high school really believe that the number one issue from the ‘gay lobby’ is instituting mandatory abortions for all women except Muslims and/or illegal immigrants?!” And then you move on with your day.
I think that’s why only a few people bother to contribute to comment threads, while a silent majority of hundreds of friends and friends of friends read without ever adding their thoughts to the mix. To the many who don’t contribute, the few that engage often seem too impassioned and angry, wasting their time discussing serious issues on such a useless forum. On this campus, there is a pretty general consensus on that point: Facebook arguments are awkward and unproductive. It’s something you passionately get wrapped into, resulting in a waste of time. If you’re smart, you avoid them altogether. Other forums are better suited for high-level debates.
But where are the better forums for these discussions on campus? At Harvard, students and administrators always speak of creating “inclusive” and safe spaces to “engage meaningfully” in “productive dialogue.” In practice, I don’t know what the hell that even means. And I don’t think the administration really knows either.
Is section a magical place like that? Well, a lot of students are too bored or too shy to speak up in section. And, besides that, different class topics tend to attract different people with similar viewpoints, making section more of an echo chamber than a discussion section. Outside of section, you’re likely hanging out with a close group of friends, who probably share the same viewpoints.
Let me ask then: What if these magical spaces have been with us all along, hiding on our web browsers’ other open tab?
Here’s what makes Facebook debates special: Unlike more hectic online forums, it has a natural regulatory body—your friends. Whenever you post, you know that people you interact with every day can see what you’ve written. This peer pressure usually maintains a floor of civility and intelligence. So, Facebook discussions are close enough among your friends (especially at Harvard) to avoid the Nazi comparisons…most of the time. Yet, they are broad enough to go beyond the dining hall, since distant friends and friends of friends can participate.
There are other benefits to Facebook-talking too. Unlike an oral argument, people can take more time to think through and edit their points. And unlike a written article or column, there’s a real-time back-and-forth that allows arguments to progress farther in a shorter amount of time.
So, oddly enough, the cesspool of data, cat videos, porn, and Yahoo Answers known as the Internet has accidentally spawned a debate platform that combines peer-review, live debate, and social interaction. These debates allow us to hear perspectives from distant friends and strangers. They allow us to express our own views. They spark conversations that continue outside of Facebook. And they allow us to gauge where people stand in our community—whether that’s at Harvard or among our friends from home.
Sure, it’s not perfect, especially since only a few of the more vocal people on campus usually engage in these debates. But if we were to stop speaking about Facebook arguments as if they are all unproductive wastes of time, then more voices would feel comfortable participating and the conversations would improve.
We shouldn’t think of these discussions as awkward. Rather, we should look to them as opportunities to challenge our own perspectives and articulate our views. We have the tools of the 21st century at our disposal. Now let’s use them to make a better democracy.
And, if you still disagree with my perspective, share your view on my Facebook timeline. I’d love to talk about it there.

To the editor:
We read with great interest The Crimson’s editorial on the new SAT in last Friday’s edition.  As The Crimson rightly points out, there has always been a steep linear correlation between socioeconomic background and test scores. The SAT and the ACT are, in a sense,  general lifetime achievement tests affected profoundly by opportunity.
There have been several major changes in the SAT over the past two decades including “re-centering” in the 1990’s and the addition of the writing test a little over a decade ago.  Each time the College Board has provided information that helps students, secondary schools, and colleges calibrate the changes relative to the previous version of the test.
Standardized tests are only one of the many factors that we use in our whole-person approach to evaluating applicants.  We will continue to monitor regularly the effect of all standardized tests including the new SAT.
The reforms encompassed in the new SAT send an important signal to high school students across America. Students who work hard in the classroom on a daily basis should significantly improve their chances of doing well on the SAT and graduating from the college of their choice.  Most important of all, students will be better able to embrace learning in all its forms, from the humanities to the social sciences, the natural sciences, engineering, and mathematics.
The College Board’s association with Khan Academy promises to provide additional support for students from all economic backgrounds who wish to prepare in advance for the new SAT.  With Khan Academy’s free test-prep, students can acquire the knowledge they need not just to succeed on the test, but to succeed in college and beyond.
We certainly share The Crimson's interest in doing everything possible to level the playing field in standardized testing.

You’ll oftentimes find Harvard’s Privileged Liberal studying in a coffee shop (Starbucks, no less) sipping on a pricey macchiato. As they flip through the pages of their assigned readings, a notification pops up on their iPhone: Social Justice Club meets in 10 minutes. They get up and walk towards the door, their designer boots clicking loudly on the floor. As they exit the coffee shop they pass by a homeless man, slumped over on his side as he shivers in the New England cold; they pay no attention, wearing their brand new Canada Goose jacket (retailing at about $600 a pop)—it provides only enough warmth for one. They arrive to their meeting just on time, and as they sit down and pop open their shiny Macbook Pro, they share Bernie Sanders’s latest speech on Facebook as he attacks the “billionaire class."
Harvard is undoubtedly a bastion for political activism. And while I admire this extreme contrast from the apolitical culture of my high school, it’s been uncanny noticing how student opinion at Harvard often takes a leftward, anti-market approach on economic issues. I suppose this shouldn’t come as a surprise. President Nixon notably called Harvard the “Kremlin on the Charles”; between 2011 and 2014, 84 percent of campaign donations by Harvard faculty went to Democrats and all three of Harvard’s most recent classes (2017, 2018, 2019) overwhelmingly self-identified as “liberal.” Why is it, however, that the children of the nation’s elite seem to have such disdain for the very system that, whether or not they’d like to admit, grants them many of the luxuries they enjoy?
This phenomenon isn’t restricted solely to Harvard. In fact, some of the left’s contemporary heroes have also been some of the free market’s greatest beneficiaries. While the median income in America is about $53,000, Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton and her husband, earned $139 million from 2007 to 2014—all while proclaiming that “inequality is a drag on our economy.” These “champions” for working families, like their Harvard counterparts, are comparable to champagne socialists, to borrow the British term—individuals who preach the virtues of egalitarianism while splurging in their own extravagances.
Now, I’m not declaring that all Democrats live affluently, nor that all leftists at Harvard come from wealthy families or are devotees of Marx and Engels. Wealthy politicians reside on both sides of the aisle, Republican and Democrat alike; having wealth certainly doesn’t disqualify you from speaking out on important economic issues facing the nation. Anything but. However, what I am saying is that much of the rhetoric and class warfare which the modern left utilizes seems to contradict the lifestyles its leaders lead, yet so harshly critique. And in that same light, as a student who comes from a family making less than the national median income, I find it particularly amusing when I see someone walking through the Yard in Burberry, or raving about their family’s summer in Milan, later hash-tagging #FeelTheBern on Facebook as they attack the free market and claim to know what America’s middle class really needs.
It is natural, as Harvard students, to believe that all problems are solvable if provided with the right approach; this leads us to think that with the right government program or regulation, America’s economic woes—income inequality, poverty, etc.—can be fixed. But America’s economic troubles cannot be solved like a math equation, nor can they fit into a bureaucratic one-size-fits-all hypothesis. Poverty in America, for example (one of many), has remained vastly persistent, even after $20 trillion spent by the government since President Johnson enacted his War on Poverty in 1964. In fact, as of 2014, four in 10 African American children and three in 10 Hispanic children live in poverty; and, as of mid-2011, it was estimated that 1.7 million American households were living on cash incomes of less than $2 per day.
For the sons and daughters of those who’ve benefitted most from the free market, it’s easy for them to talk about the evils of money—the evils of capitalism—because they’ve never had to  face the reality of being part of the working class. A new tax to them means a couple less dollars to spend on the next vacation; another government regulation means a few workers their parents are forced to lay off. They are utterly removed from the consequences of an overbearing regulatory state, and the catastrophic effects it has on the poorest and most vulnerable of our society.
So the next time you find yourself speaking with an affluent liberal as they rail against capitalism, remind them of a phrase the left loves to use against their opponents: check your privilege. Maybe, just maybe, they will.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On this fateful morning, every member of the Class of 2019 will learn which of the 12 Houses they can expect to live in for the next three years. It’s a big deal. On Housing Day, as we’ve come to call the Thursday before spring break, anxious freshmen will wake up early to wait with anticipation for a knock on their dorm room door—the arrival of a gaggle of their future housemates, spirited and excited to welcome the newbies into their House’s fold.
The excitement of Housing Day and the joy in its festivities are undeniably warranted. By the end of our years at Harvard, we will be able to look back on this day as the beginning of our membership in one of 12 sub-communities at Harvard that become a home to each of its student members.
And yet, in recent months, we’ve found ourselves amid constant discussions about a lack of adequately welcoming social spaces on campus. So on this Housing Day, we’d like to remind everyone of the 12 social spaces—literal and figurative—that are just waiting to be shaped by the students within them. And in particular, we’d like to urge the freshmen to bear the torch in this endeavor. It is largely up to the students to make their Houses truly vibrant communities if this is what the students seek. Rising sophomores should know that merely living in a House will not make it a community.
We admit, there are kinks in the Housing Day proceedings—if not the upperclass housing system in general—that could use some straightening. Take the element of storming the freshman dorms, for example. Though the appearance of cheering, House-attired upperclassmen is an exciting way to hear the results of the housing lottery for some, students with social anxiety may find this tradition to be overwhelming and uncomfortable. And though it’s designed to be enjoyed by blocking groups of all sizes, some floaters don’t enjoy the prospect of a rowdy group of upperclassmen descending on their dorm room. For these students, the email notification sent later in the day is a sufficient announcement of the result of their housing lottery. They should be allowed to opt out of the festivities if they so desire and receive an email at the same time dorms are stormed.
Likewise, in the interest of reducing stress for everyone involved, we’d like to see Housing Day moved to the Saturday before spring break. This way, freshmen would not have to worry about juggling midterms, homework, and extracurricular commitments while also participating in the Housing Day programming.
Regardless of the logistics of Housing Day’s festivities, this Thursday is a day to celebrate the re-calibrating of Harvard’s social terrain. For the next few months, every student on this campus will be affiliated with a House, each one special and each with the potential to become a welcoming, energizing, and exciting home for its members if they are willing to make it so. While there is much to be done to render the Houses fully inclusive social spaces for students, that work can and should start with the student body.
House life is an opportunity to build a community at Harvard, but it is what you make of it. To the upperclassmen already in Houses: welcome your freshmen energetically. And to the freshmen preparing to join a House: go forth and do so with verve. Don’t waste a year or even a semester feeling timid about joining your House’s community. You’ve only got a few before it’s time to go. If we truly want to create more and more varied social spaces, we should start with the Houses, and we should start today.

At Mesker Park Zoo in Evansville, Ind., at the bottom of a steady paved slope down which zoo-goers clop and struggle, in the shade of various high-boughed trees (elms, probably), rests a forlorn-looking boat. It is anchored for eternity in a shallow pool of chlorinated water that reflects the vibrant shades of paint—sky blue, red, yellow, maroon—along its hull and cabin.
Built at the shrewdly high-flying and Barnum-esque behest of then-Zoo Director Gilmore Haynie in 1933, the boat—a replica of the Santa Maria, considerately reconstructed at one-third scale—housed 20 rhesus macaques, give or take, from the day of its christening until some time in the late 1990s or early 2000s, when even the reluctant taste of this Midwestern city deemed the whole monkeys-on-a-boat spectacle a little too cruel, a little outré.
Nowadays the pool around the ship is filled with loud gas-powered bumper boats. Children scoot about in the variously handicapped vessels, some of which, once accelerated, will keep on speeding until the gas runs out, and others of which, beset by jammed rudders, turn in endless circles despite the tiny hands that jerk at their steering wheels, so that their queasy pilots must be rescued from their purgatorial whirligigs by a long pole, tipped with a hook, wielded by a teenage attendant.
The Monkey Ship, I had thought, was always my little secret. An obscure Midwestern curio, an irreducible spectacle, a garish consumerist plea—it was all of these things, and for that reason, a little funny. But it was also something to be ashamed of. It said something about the incurious psyche of the average American, who would have been unsatisfied by a mere historical replica or by monkeys, alone; who would pay to see, however, an arbitrary combination of the two.
It was a thing that by pure noteworthiness deserved to go unnoted. And so it was infinitely strange to find it touched upon in, of all books, “Lolita.”
Midway through the novel, when Humbert Humbert is carting his Lo back and forth across the United States in a movement that is half road trip, half flight, a few pages devolve into a catalogic longueur of sights seen, of townships touched. It is an Americana carousel, including, among countless obscure stops, Mount Rushmore, Crater Lake, The Corn Palace in South Dakota—and then, like a bolt from the blue, on page 158 of my annotated edition: “A zoo in Indiana where a large troop of monkeys lived on a concrete replica of Christopher Columbus’ flagship.”
When I read this it was as though my eyes, carelessly shifting back and forth like fingertips along the stem of an unrecognized bloom, had stumbled upon a thorn. I paused, of course, and felt strangely impaled, this précis of an obscure phenomenon—hitherto, I’d assumed, known only to me—whinging back from the past, wielded now, by another hand, like a knife. I flipped to the back of the book and read the corresponding annotation: “[T]he zoo exists, in Evansville, Indiana. Its monkeys—kept out-of-doors on the ship from April to November—continue to be the zoo’s most popular attraction.”
A number of questions occurred to me. I wondered whether Nabokov himself had visited the zoo, or whether he’d gotten all he’d needed from a postcard, perhaps purchased at a yard sale. But more importantly, I asked myself: What was my monkey ship doing in this tawdry tale? And why?
Without diving too formlessly into the outsize pool of literary theorizing, it seems to me there’s an incredible effect enveloped in this appearance of the monkey ship—and it’s of course incredibly proper that it should be a hidden effect, that it should go entirely unnoticed by nearly all readers (V.N. and H.H. having loved, to a fault, their games, their oily allusions).

I’d always hated that particular section of “Lolita;” it goes on and on, vacillating between ubiquity (Mount Rushmore) and ignominy (The Monkey Ship), seeming, at first blush, merely an opportunity for Nabokov to demonstrate his all-knowingness, his adoptive fluency in the superficial language of Americana. And yet, I had to admit, on reconsideration, that he’d stabbed at me, that he’d struck out from the page—and I’d been startled, because it seemed he’d been present in a private place. It was the effect of a terrible, of a horrifying insinuation.
To get the full effect of this reference to the monkey ship, I had only to recall a few summers ago, when I’d gone with my brother and his two children to visit the zoo, and their eyes, ineluctably, had been drawn to The Monkey Ship, now missing its hirsute inhabitants. The boys went down and plopped themselves into bumper boats, while I rested my arms on the high wall around the pool and watched them. I realized, looking back, that anywhere in the crowd around us could have been a creep—a dolorous yet dapper H.H. sleuthing or standing stiff, obvious or obscure, yet undeniably there, right where he shouldn’t be, where the common law of safety in obscurity had always promised he couldn’t be.
But you can’t look about yourself in memories. You can only begin to suspect, and then to worry about, all the things you might have missed.

Kirkland House Faculty Dean Verena Andermead Conley usually restricts her work with romance to the French language. As Long-Term Visiting Professor of Comparative Literature and Romance Languages and Literatures, she’s written on the environment, technology, film, cultural theory, and all their various intersections. Her newest book, “Cree: To Believe in the World,” explores a different subject entirely: It’s a romance novel. FM met with Conley to discuss the love, fraught relationships, and the pleasure involved in crafting books.
Fifteen Minutes: How did you get into romance novels (if that’s what you would call your latest work)?
Verena Conley: It’s very funny, because I didn’t envision it as that, but it’s interesting that that’s the reaction I’ve gotten. I wanted to write an environmental fiction that was different from the fictions I usually read, where you have a big company that is a villain, and then the person who discovers that the company has polluted something. So I tried to do something that would bring out some of [these] problems and also attract attention to a character who is really alienated from the world and just thinks about her work.
My big obsession right now is the question of care, in the sense of attentiveness to the world. We live in a world of censors where experience is discounted, but I still wanted to go back to a case where the woman from [this world] becomes observant and starts to look at the world better. But then it was picked up as “the woman goes through the divorce, and suddenly has this conversion.”
FM: How do you feel about the title of romance novelist?
VC: I am greatly amused! I have not seen myself this way, but I like it. Usually people accuse me of being highly abstract.
FM: So there’s a bit of separation between your own experiences and the works that you produce?
VC: I think it comes from other things you read or see and there is a separation. The writing is not autobiographical, per se. But there are certain constants, nonetheless; certain preoccupations. There’s always a kernel of something that you like and that you do that’s repeated over time.
FM: Can you give me an example of one of those kernels?
VC: I’m like a little girl when it comes to romantic movies. I like oldie old actresses and their old movies. Now you don’t have old romantic movies anymore. So I have a great appetite for that.
FM: Could you see yourself writing to fulfill that appetite for yourself and other people who miss that old style?
VC: The people who read “Cree” said I should have been more explicit with the love story. And I said, “That’s not my way of being.” I’m a very understated person.
FM: Where do you find inspiration for your work? Do you look for it, or does it come to you?
VC: I think it comes to you, and it really comes through you. Something that you read about and then suddenly think, “That’s it! I really want to spend time on this and I want to explore this question more.” You have to see theoretical writing [as] almost like being with a person. You have to write and read a lot of books, so you have to want to be with these books and have [them] keep you company and open your imagination and then really engage with them, like having a relationship with a person. The more your mind gets to work, the more you want to do it.
But at the same time, I would like to insist that I read and write from other books, from fictional books, from all kinds of books or from films. It’s not an expression of a self. It usually comes from something I watch, and I get bits and pieces of a film or of a book or of a character.
FM: Do you have any upcoming projects or things you’re working on?
VC: I always work on a lot of things, time permitting. I have a longer project precisely on the notion of care. I have another fun project about somebody who falls in love with an image on TV, and then their whole life sort of unravels. And then I have a funny thing too; I still want to do a funny thing.
FM: Do you have any musings about love and romance at Harvard?
VC: At Harvard, there is romance now as there was in the old days. Of course people are so busy now that they don’t have time for romance, or so it seems, but when spring comes around, you watch it blossom here and it’s always nice. I think it’s lovely that people have romantic feelings, especially in the spring. Still happens the way it did before. Even in the day of Instagrams and what is it, Cinderella?

FM: Tinder.
VC: [Laughs.] Tinder. It still happens. Nothing will ever take this away. But it’s also different because, especially at Harvard, people don’t have that much time.
FM: Anything else on the topic of love and romance, or your work?
VC: Of course there always has to be a romance. I wanted to combine that romance with a different sense of perception that the woman gets [as a result]. In this day of censors where perception is really no more, I want to emphasize that there is such a thing, and that you can perceive the world. There’s always a transformation of blindness and insight, perhaps of an event that makes you see things differently, and the romance is part of that.
Come on—how could you have life without romance? There’s no such thing. It’s very boring. That’s precisely what happens to this character in the beginning. She’s so focused totally on her work that she doesn’t see anything, so that ends in divorce. So do I say that you shouldn’t be committed to your work? No, not at all. But I wanted a sense of perception and a strong sense of the world.

Ben: This weekend I was in a play that involved roughly 20 minutes of galavanting around a stage in my underwear. Always eager to suffer for my art, I thought, “Hey, why not do one of them nifty juice cleanses to prepare? I like juice. I like cleanliness. I can combine these and get swole to epic proportions for the show.”

Andrew: ...
Ben: What was that, Andrew? Oh, it was nothing, because you’re a sock puppet.
Yes, Andrew has abandoned me this week for an HMC conference, which I assume stands for Horrible Missing Co-writer or something like that. Without the Kathie Lee to my Regis, I was forced to turn to the internet to learn about cleansing. Apparently you’re supposed to “pre-cleanse,” in which you incrementally cut down on solid foods, to prevent horrible side effects. You’re also supposed to order special juices online so you don’t die from malnutrition. This all sounded like a racket to me. I settled on drinking only the finest of nectars all week: HUDS apple juice.
Andrew: …
Ben: Haha! Good one, sock puppet Andrew. That statement is funny, because it’s true. According to nutritional facts obtained online, HUDS apple juice contains 120 calories per serving, which is actually way more than I expected. All I would have to do was drink three-and-a-half servings a meal, and it’d be like normal. I started off strong on Tuesday, chaining down juice after juice before breakfast. At about this moment I realized a major flaw in my plan: I actually hate apple juice. As a child, I worked as a waiter at sleepaway camp, and thus engaged in the age old waiter-dishboy rivalry. I defeated a dishboy in a pickle juice shot-drinking competition (the first to puke lost), and won myself an ice cream sandwich. Ever since, I have developed an aversion to all acidic liquids. I decided to switch  to
Vitamin Water (also 120 calories) for the remainder of the cleanse and soldiered on.
Andrew: …
Ben: Yes, it did get worse, Andrew. I started to flag halfway through my first class, when I had to visit the bathroom on three separate occasions. It became a true nightmare when, upon returning to the d-hall for my next “meal,” I found myself face-to-face with chicken pesto ciabatta sandwich day.
Andrew: …
Ben: Andrew… I don’t… I don’t think we can publish that. Wow.
Andrew: …
Ben: You apologize to our faithful readers this instant!
Andrew: …
Ben: Jesus, that’s better. Thank you. Now, where were we? Ah yes, the cleanse, or as it shall go down in the annals of our time, #cleanseit2k16. The next morning I made the snap decision that yes, coffee was a juice. Bean juice. The day saw me sail clear through lunch, food free, which was aided by the lack of edible options served that day. By dinner time, I felt the cleanse coursing through me. The juice was inside of me, a part of me, beating in time with my heart. Or maybe that was just the hunger delirium setting in. My director saw
me eyeing the other actors, whom I believe I had been considering grilling and putting on a nice toasted sesame bun with some caramelized onions and mustard (just a random example), and force-fed me a few cupcakes until I returned to sanity.
Andrew: …
Ben: Like you did much better. You weren’t even here!
Andrew: …
Ben: Don’t call me that! Only my mother gets to call me that!
Andrew: …
Ben: Oh that’s the last straw. Where’d I put that apple juice? Get over here!
Sounds of a struggle.
Ben: Drink it!
Loud bang. Yelping.
Ben: Alright. Fine. You win.
Andrew: …
Ben: I hate apple juice.
Andrew: …
Ben: No, sorry, I don’t want any trouble.
Slurping.
Ben: Ugh, god. Moral of the story: Juice is a beverage, not a meal. Tune in next week for my steak cleanse.

Junot Díaz, author of “The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao,” is one incredible multitasker. Only minutes after giving a two-hour talk, Díaz simultaneously signs piles of books for fans and chats with FM.

FM: You always say you’re a voracious reader, so what’s currently sitting on your nightstand?
JD: My goddaughter, who lives in Japan—her photograph.
FM: Well, what are you reading now?
JD: I am reading all the finalists for the Pulitzer Prize. I’m on the board, so it’s confidential, but it’s an enormous amount of reading.
FM: With regards to writings, what have you been working on over the past two weeks?
JD: What I’ve been working on is the introduction to “Best American Short Stories,” and I’ve been working on a kids’ story for [my goddaughter]. My goddaughter, the same one on my nightstand, asked me for a story for her, so I have to write her one.
FM: Who is someone you really admire in academia right now?
JD: Oh my God, in academia?... I admire Arlene Davila. She’s an anthropologist over at NYU. I admire her tremendously. I admire another colleague of mine, someone who of course is absolutely brilliant, the scholar Satya Mohanty. He made a huge impact on me as an intellectual. And another scholar, her name is Paula Moya, she’s over at Stanford. She’s both a friend and someone whose work has been hugely influential on me.
FM: Who else outside of academia?
JD: Oh! The journalist Óscar Martínez, who wrote "La Bestia." That was a really, really important book. That book fucking blew me the fuck away—it was extraordinary.
FM: Changing topics a little bit: During the dialogue that was just hosted, you talked about the Black Lives Matter movement. Why now? Why is this something that has come up over the last year and not 10 years ago?
JD: Well, it’s always an interesting game trying to figure out and reverse-engineer why a movement came up, and you could always come up with a thousand different combinations of causes, but probably those same arguments and conditions could have been met elsewhere and nothing happened. I think history is a very spooky, spooky thing.
FM: What about our current context has made these types of movements so prevalent at this very moment?
JD: Certainly there’s no accident that we have a plurality of young people who have leveraged social media and leveraged a critical set of skills around race and culture and hegemony and a common vocabulary to great effect. And it’s just important that we have a generation of young people who are growing up with this model, whatever its shortcomings may be. Young people actively trying to transform their society—there’s going to be a lot more of that. Just in terms of demographics alone and how many more young people there are, being a young person under these neoliberal conditions is a very fraught affair. No wonder these kids and young people are trying to kick ass because this system is a burden to them, and I’m not surprised that some of them are trying to transform it. You can draw these same connections from Black Lives Matter to Arab Spring to all sorts of youth movements across the world. Young people have grown in numbers, and they’re growing in confidence, and they’re facing a society that has been organized to lock them out, and they want to change that.
FM: Given the current context of the elections and Donald Trump—a candidate pretty widely recognized to be conservative on these issues—winning states like Massachusetts, do you think that now is a good time? Would these discussions have been better placed a few years ago?
JD: So rare are eruptions of activism that have at [their hearts] justice that I am just so glad to have it—I never wished to have it earlier or later. I think these things arrive just in time. I tend to be more pragmatic; I’m like, “We’re just lucky to have them.” It is earthshaking for us to have a movement like this at any moment. It’s very inspirational to me to see what has occured and what is happening, both as an activist and as someone who is just interested in the future.
FM: Why do you think so many of these conversations have really taken root on university campuses?
JD: I think because we have a critical mass of smart, young people with the spaces and the technological means to have these conversations. Look, for a lot of young people, universities are places where they simultaneously come to understand themselves and understand the conditions of the world in which they inhabit.... It’s not a surprise that at that intersection of self-knowledge and world-knowledge and youth you begin to see these kinds of energetic conversations and movements.
FM: One of the problems that many groups on campuses face when organizing is that institutional memory is so short. What can people do to try and combat that?
JD: One of the things is to understand that the nature of this beast is that it reboots every few years and that there have to be ways for this generation to think about archiving some of its experiences—whether each group comes with its own strategies—thinking about having Houses with a designated historian. For example, why doesn’t the history and the counter-history of each of these Harvard Houses get handed to each student? That would, at least for me, be an interesting way to keep historical memory alive.
FM: What do you make of the change to the House master title?
JD: Harvard is very Talmudic in its self-preoccupations; it’s not surprising that it has excited a lot of activity. If they had conferred with any of us decades ago, we probably could have told them that it was probably time to change the title. I think these universities like to cover their innocence when in fact the real question is why were we not asked 50, 70, 90 years ago. How is it that an institution that has benefited so clearly from chattel slavery is unaware of some of the larger resonances that some of these “innocent terms” might have on the children of the very enslaved Africans who enriched these spaces?
FM: What do you think about Harvard’s decision to not offer Latinx studies here?
JD: These schools determine, in a large part through their institutional power, what is worthy of study, and it is nothing short of criminal that at this day and age Harvard not only does not have Latinx studies, but that there’s still a conversation being bandied around. It also shows you how hegemony works. I mean, those of us who are attempting to understand how latinidad works in this world, those of us who embody latinidad, those of us who are imbricated in latinidad—we have to put ideas of ourselves together by the seat of our pants. We don’t have institutional power that opens up spaces of deliberation that allows us to become and understand. It’s hard for a community to come to understand itself.
FM: You say this is critical to understand ourselves. How does this affect other communities?
JD: It takes these white kids kindergarten, elementary school, middle school, high school, college, television, politicians, their doctors, their physical neighborhoods…. Everything is an academy that teaches them about themselves, and when we come to a place like Harvard, where riches are endless, the largest “community of color” cannot have a small space where it may begin to access itself. It’s extraordinary.
FM: How does your experience working in English and Spanish differ? During your talk, you mentioned that Spanish language has a more fluid nature, and you can take some words and spin them in new ways.
JD: I would say that characterologically, I’m different in the two languages. I’m very well defended in English. In English, it’s like I’m a Death Star, and I would say that I’m far more sincere in Spanish. My friends always say, “Wow, you are such a nice and relaxed person in Spanish.”
FM: What’s up your sleeve for the next year?
JD: I’ll just keep trying to work. My work takes forever. I’m the slowest writer I know, so I’ll just keep trying to work. I’ll spend another five years trying to write a single chapter, I guess. We’ll see what happens.

Brittany L. Usinger  ’19 checks WHOOP on her phone every morning.
Usinger, like nine of her 32 teammates on Harvard’s women’s varsity swim team, wears a WHOOP strap on her wrist that tracks her heart rate and collects an enormous amount of other data. WHOOP is a “performance optimization system” founded by two Harvard graduates and one Harvard drop-out. It was designed for elite athletes and is currently used by students as well as professionals, including LeBron James and Michael Phelps.
Like all college athletes, Usinger faces the challenge of balancing academics, extracurriculars, and her sport. These athletes need adequate rest and recovery time in order to perform at their best each day. That’s where WHOOP comes in. The WHOOP system analyzes exertion, sleep, and other variables to produce a recovery score, which indicates the body’s readiness to perform. On any given morning, a WHOOP user may wake up to a high green score—a “go-ahead” for practices and competitions—or a “no-go” low red score.
WHOOPED INTO SHAPE
Only a handful of athletic teams at Harvard use WHOOP, and most coaches introduced it at the beginning of this year. So far, WHOOP has received generally positive reviews from Harvard’s student athletes.
“I think it quantifies things that I didn’t really understand before,” says Kendall P. Crawford ’16, another member of the women’s varsity swim team. “I knew that I maybe needed about eight hours of sleep, but I didn’t understand how that fluctuates with exertion.”
Crawford, like many of Harvard’s WHOOP users, appreciates having greater awareness of what her body needs to perform well and having those needs presented in the form of  “cut-and-dry” data.
“It has definitely made a difference in me understanding my body and being able to communicate with my coach,” she says. “If I realize that my recovery score is low and I haven’t been sleeping well, I’d be able to tell my coach, ‘I think I’m getting sick. I think I need a lighter workout.’”
Coaches see the benefits their athletes gain from using WHOOP’s many features and utilize the information to push their players to their limits, but not over.
“When athletes customize the amount work that they’re doing and do it sensibly according to the way their bodies are actually recovering—not the way their work ethic tells them to do—they actually train smarter,” Dave Fish, the head coach for men’s tennis, says.
Coaches also benefit from the WHOOP system because they can access a snapshot of the data, including strain and recovery information, if the athlete agrees. They can then tailor workouts according to how their players are feeling that particular day.
“We’ve always sort of done that qualitatively like, ‘How are you feeling this morning? How’s this workout going?’” Christopher City, head coach of the Harvard skiing team, says. “But what the WHOOP strap offers is a chance to get some quantitative data on how athletes are recovering from the workouts.”
Not only can coaches see some of the information, but teammates can also use the WHOOP app to view the strain and recovery scores of their teammates. Like many things at Harvard, WHOOP promotes a bit of friendly competition.
“You can see who got the most intense training score and you can compare yourself with your teammates and kind of make fun of them a little if they got a lower score than you,” Usinger says.
Competition aside, WHOOP seems to have the most significant impact on an individual level. “It can help to make people more accountable for getting the recovery that they need,” Crawford says. “If you’re not trying to use it to better yourself and your training, there’s no point in doing it at all.”
WHOOP D’ÉTAT
John Capodilupo, a former member of Harvard’s class of 2014 and Chief Technology Officer at WHOOP, met his future co-founder, Will Ahmed ’12, in the dining hall of Quincy House, where both of them lived. Ahmed, a senior at the time, was captain of the men’s varsity squash team. Capodilupo, a sophomore, was a computer science concentrator. The two were introduced by mutual friends.
“He was doing super high-performance athletics, but really received no quantifiable data about what he was doing to his body,” Capodilupo recalls. “He intended to found the company right out of college.”
After Ahmed graduated, Capodilupo worked with him over the summer and ultimately chose to “put Harvard on pause” to help build the company. Aurelian Nicolae ’12, a co-founder and Product Development Engineer at WHOOP, joined the team soon after.
“Along the way, [Ahmed and I] realized that we were building a hardware product and neither of us knew anything about hardware,” Capodilupo says. “One of my good friends from Harvard, Aurelian Nicolae, graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering. I asked him to come aboard and he agreed.”
Ahmed, Capodilupo, and Nicolae spent the first year-and-a-half after the company’s founding at Harvard’s Innovation Lab across the Charles. Since then, WHOOP has transformed from a concept to a physical product, and the team behind it has expanded enormously. WHOOP boasts an all-star list of advisors, including Nicholas Negroponte, professor and founder of MIT’s Media Lab, and Stephen Wolfram, creator of Mathematica and Wolfram Alpha.
Equally impressive is WHOOP’s current roster of clients, which includes Olympic athletes and teams from various institutions such as University of Michigan and Vanderbilt, according to Capodilupo. He said that WHOOP has also been in negotiations with professional leagues such as the MLB and NFL, and that the company is “definitely in discussions with various branches of the military.”
The product officially launched in September of 2015, although access to the WHOOP system is still limited. To access the WHOOP app, one needs the brand’s signature wristband, which the company has sold to a limited number of teams and clients. However, the WHOOP team intends to market the product to a larger audience in the long run.
“If we build brand recognition around working with the best athletes in the world, we could use those factors to move further downstream into the market into a more open sales commission,” Capodilupo explains. “Whether you’re LeBron James or a CTO programmer who doesn’t get to exercise too much, you’ll get valuable insights into how you’re sleeping, how you recover, how well you’re going to perform, those different things.”
Capodilupo too wears a WHOOP strap to track his rest and performance, but the fast-paced life of a startup founder often leaves little room for lifestyle adjustments.
“I try, but the schedule here doesn’t allow too much time for more sleep,” he says.

Emily A. Pate ’16 balls up her black winter jacket, tosses it on a bench, and walks away.
“We can just leave our stuff here?” I ask hesitantly. Maybe it’s my New York City roots kicking in, but I’m always wary of leaving my belongings out wide open in the public. She turns around and shoots me a smile.
“Yeah, definitely,” she says, and the blonde bun on the top of her head gives a little bounce as she nods. I look around the Brooklyn Boulders climbing gym and feel a sense of reassurance.
It’s very hip. The walls are covered in vibrant graffiti: Spiderman stares at me from one corner of the room, orange fire frames every door, and neon pink tags span long corridors. It’s strangely, almost a little uncomfortably, reminiscent of a startup. The place is huge and open. Upstairs there’s even a workspace, furnished with long wooden tables and brightly-colored bouncy balls as chairs, offering an unobstructed view of the climbing walls. “It’s more of a lifestyle gym than a serious climbing gym,” Pate later tells me.
Pate has been climbing since the age of eight. She was raised by a gymnast mother and a mountaineering father, and she used to compete in the USA Climbing Youth Circuit. Despite her small frame—she looks just a few inches over five feet—she is clearly in incredible shape. Her arms and shoulders are toned, and she walks in rubber climbing shoes with light grace.
Pate excels at bouldering, which is a form of rock climbing performed without the use of ropes or harnesses. Artificial bouldering walls are usually less than 20 feet high, and climbers scale them using colorful bulges. A set of the same-colored bulges is called a “problem.” Problems are ranked on a V-scale, starting at V-0 and going all the way up to V-16.
The problem that Pate is currently working on looks difficult, but her climbing itself looks effortless. At one point her legs cross over one another as she almost dances across the wall to stabilize her footing; at another, she inverts her knee inward like a wheel to reach for another protrusion.
Sitting on the padded blue mats, I watch her in awe along with the company of her friends who cheer her on. There were four other Harvard students at Brooklyn Boulders by the time Pate and I had arrived: Ian G. Grant ’17, Eliza S. Hale ’16, Kevin A. Hornbeck ’16, and Evan R. Sandhoefner ’17. They’re all in good spirits, with white chalk on their hands and grins on their faces.
Eliza tells me that, beyond climbing, coming here is a nice way to hang out with friends. “Half of it is sitting on the mat and talking to people,” she says. Kevin nods in agreement.
They’re here quite often, too. On weeks with heavy workloads, they all come around two or three times a week, and on weeks with more downtime, they aim for between four and five visits. The group also has a diverse range of  experience in bouldering: Ian started in high school, Kevin began three months ago, Evan has been climbing since freshman year, and Eliza was brought to Brooklyn Boulders for the first time by Pate during the fall of their sophomore year. Regardless, they all seem equally enthusiastic and eager to be here with everyone else.

“I used to play tennis when I was younger, but bouldering is a lot different,” Pate says. “[Bouldering] can still be just as competitive, but, in many ways, everyone is a lot more encouraging.”
Perhaps that’s because the sport is just as mentally taxing as it is physically. “It’s really cerebral,” Ian says. “When you’re having trouble with a problem, you have to think creatively about the different ways you can approach it.”
Thankfully, the climbers have each other to help out. They watch each other climb and constantly shout words of encouragement. When one person falls or slips, the friends make suggestions as to what he or she could have done better. Maybe you could move your foot here, or grab that with your right hand instead, they say.
Together, they form their own sort of world. Beyond the gates of Harvard—the math problem sets, response papers, blocking group drama, and sometimes stressful social scene—there are five Harvard students covered in chalk, laughing and making their way up walls in a hip Somerville climbing gym.

Sixteen miles from Harvard Yard, the woods outside Bedford, Mass. are still and leafless. As I step out of the car, a light snowfall blows over three small concrete buildings and some chain link animal pens. I’ve hitched a ride to Harvard’s Concord Field Station, which at first glance seems like an unlikely match for what NPR described in 2011 as “the coolest lab in the world.”
Yet there’s more to Concord than meets the eye. Inside its walls, Biology Professor Andrew A. Biewener supervises groundbreaking experiments in comparative biomechanics, using an assortment of lab animals from around the world. And below its surface, the Museum of Comparative Zoology stores its oversized items in bunkers formerly used to house Nike missiles during the Cold War.
It’s a lot to manage for one small Harvard outpost. But the atmosphere at Concord remains fairly laid-back. For one thing, it’s a lot easier to find parking here than in the Square. “I leave my keys in the car,” Biewener says as we walk across the grounds, followed by his black Labrador, Sadie. “It’s a safe place here.” He’s worked at Concord since 1999 and has seen the station change in many ways. The sense of calm, though, as been a constant.
Biewener, who co-teaches Life Sciences 2: “Evolutionary Human Physiology and Anatomy” when he’s not at Concord, is an expert in animal locomotion. His research focuses on animals’ neuromuscular function as they move through their environments, from land to water to air. Studying these processes requires some unconventional lab equipment, such as the massive wind tunnel housed in one of Concord’s buildings. It’s essentially an “air treadmill” for birds, and allows Biewener to study their motion from multiple angles as they fly in place. “The resources here are pretty unique,” he tells me. “I’m one of the few people that can actually study animal flight along with terrestrial locomotion.”
These resources include the animals themselves. Besides the birds, Concord has also housed kangaroos, chimpanzees, horses, lion cubs, and antelope in its 40-year history of animal physiology studies. Many of these animals have been trained to run on another of the lab’s unique features, a custom-built treadmill from 1972 that is still in use today. Inside, Biewener introduces me to the lab’s jerboas: tiny, hyperactive desert rodents housed in cages variously labelled “CRAZY, “BITEY,” “INBRED” and “SAVE BRAIN FOR HILLERY METZ.” Sadie eyes one with a hungry expression. An elderly emu outside is left over from a previous P.h.D’s experiments, and hasn’t been used for science in years. “We just keep him around,” says Biewener. “I pay for him out of supplemental funds.”
He’s not the biggest leftover housed at Concord, though. Underneath the wind tunnel, Biewener escorts me into a cool, dusty chamber lined with countless wooden shelves holding huge bones. This is the bulk of the MCZ’s cetacean collection, housing almost all of its whale and dolphin specimens. Standing among them is eerie: I’m dwarfed by many of the skulls, which are easily twice my height, as they lean haphazardly against the wall. Here, too, the legacy of Concord’s past is most visible. Biewener directs my attention to a series of hinges lining the ceiling. In the 1950s, these would have allowed surface-to-air Nike missiles to be raised from this bunker in case of aircraft attack. Biewener doesn’t mention, though, what I’m wondering: Does the mechanism still work?
It’s chilly down in the bunker. According to Linda Ford, Director of Collections Operations at the MCZ, this is a serious issue.
“For proper storage of specimens, especially skeletal, you need well-monitored temperature and humidity ranges,” she tells me in a separate interview. “Being in a bunker, there is no temperature or humidity control.” Without it, the rigid whale bones will start to degrade.
When the MCZ relocated its whale collection to Concord in the mid-1980s, she elaborates, these best practices for collection storage didn’t exist. Now, though, there isn’t enough room to house the specimens in the MCZ’s new climate-controlled storage space under Northwest Labs. Harvard’s whales and other oversized items, including samples from historically famous coral reefs, will remain where they have stayed for over 30 years—slowly disintegrating below the ground.
The current solution, Ford says, is to upgrade the bunker, adding better storage features in an attempt to preserve a portion of the collection there. “Anything you can do will buy you time,” she says. “Part of our mission is to take care of these specimens for research.”
It’s worth questioning why these upgrades have been so late in coming. Given its isolation, Concord seems liable to slip out of sight and out of mind for those spending most of their time on campus. It’s one of Harvard’s many far-flung possessions, from the Harvard Forest to Oak Ridge Observatory, dutifully maintained but often forgotten amidst the hustle and bustle of life in Cambridge.
This hasn’t always been the case: According to Biewener, “up until about 10 years ago, there was a pretty steady involvement of undergraduates doing research projects out here.” Then he switched from teaching a course on vertebrate anatomy and physiology to LS2, where students are more interested in studying humans than jerboas or emus. These days, the station has only three regular undergraduate visitors, who work paid positions as part of Biewener’s team.
Unlike Ford, Biewener isn’t concerned about physically upgrading his portion of Concord. Rather, he’d like the station to host more research programs beside his own. “The real renovation needs,” he says, “aren’t so much the facilities themselves. It’s more to have the investment in intellectual activity out here.”
Whether or not it gets this investment, Concord is unquestionably unique, even among Harvard’s secluded outposts. It’s a relic of the Cold War, reconquered by the natural world as a repository of invaluable knowledge.
As for the bunker’s missile doors? I finally ask Biewener before I leave, and he chuckles. “Those don’t work anymore,” he says. “They’re just ancient history.”

“I’ve been here for six months, and I’ve never heard of unwelcome conduct before. Do you expect people to come in knowing something about what that means?”
Amelia Y. Goldberg ’19 asks her question from the side of the Emerson lecture hall. She’s speaking directly to the curly-haired woman who stands before a small crowd of Harvard students and administrators. They’re gathered in the voluminous room for a talk titled “Sex at the College: What Does Harvard’s Policy Mean?”
It’s been a turbulent few years at Harvard. The federal government has launched investigations into the University’s compliance with the anti-sexual discrimination law Title IX—twice. Harvard overhauled its sexual harassment policies almost two years ago, garnering criticism from students and professors. A growing bureaucracy of Title IX administrators has done its best to keep up. A sense of urgency—even pain—fills the lecture hall. How does Harvard respond to cases of sexual harassment and sexual assault? And how should it?
Mia Karvonides, the woman at the front, has an answer ready.
“The unwelcome conduct standard is the very fundamental civil rights standard,” Karvonides responds, quoting almost verbatim the definition the federal government provides for sexual harassment. “Unwelcome conduct” has also become, under Karvonides, a core part of the University’s new definition of sexual harassment. “It’s been around for decades and decades, and there’s a strong legal foundation for it,” she says. 
Karvonides is Harvard’s first-ever Title IX officer, responsible, in part, for assuring the University’s compliance with the law. Once a civil rights attorney for the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, she ticks through relevant case law with a near-staccato efficiency, explaining federal guidance and requirements under Title IX over the course of the evening. She redirects questions back to members of the crowd, guiding them through Harvard’s Title IX mechanisms and administration.
By now, Karvonides is an old hand at this type of public event. The University’s policies include confusing, technical language, and Karvonides breaks from her more lawyerly training to explain it.
“Where we have fallen short since the policy went into effect is in being outward facing and having this conversation with students,” she says.
Though a response to Goldberg’s prompt, Karvonides’s admission extends well beyond any one undergraduate’s question, but hints at a problem affecting much of the College. A University survey on sexual assault last year revealed a broad state of confusion and mistrust in Harvard’s sexual assault response, as well as an alarming prevalence of sexual assault. Going off that data, less than one quarter of female undergraduates have faith in the College to act against perpetrators, less than one quarter are “very or extremely knowledgeable” about the University’s definitions for sexual harassment, and less than one quarter even know where to file a sexual assault complaint.
Karvonides directs the question back at Goldberg. “With what I’ve described, is it compelling? Does it match what you want as a member of this community?”
Goldberg pauses for a long moment. “It’s not that I have any specific problem with the policy,” she says finally. “But when I go out on a Friday night, I’m really not confident that anyone else in the room is going to know what ‘unwelcome conduct’ means.”
Karvonides’s earnest question to Goldberg reflects a broader tension in her work. Fresh off a more-than-decade long career as a civil rights lawyer, Karvonides came to Cambridge in 2013 as Harvard aimed to align itself with increasingly stringent federal Title IX standards.
But beyond crafting policy and ensuring federal compliance, Karvonides has had to work with students to respond to the feeling that, for some, Harvard is not a safe place.
When Mia Karvonides talks about sexual assault and sexual harassment on campus, she’s quick to draw attention to the complexity of the phenomenon. Rather than the “drunken hookup” scenarios that Karvonides says she sees in articles about college sexual assault, “there can be allegations of sexual assault, plus stalking plus something else… and it’s more complicated.”
Instead, Karvonides says, potential sexual misconduct and violence can be more nuanced—and so, too, must be the response. Of the 34 cases the Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution—abbreviated to ODR— has investigated since it opened in 2014, 13 involved parties were in a “dating relationship” and 16 of the total cases involved allegations of sexual assault.
As Harvard’s Title IX Officer, Karvonides wears an ever-growing number of professional hats. She oversees Harvard’s web of 50 Title IX coordinators at each of the 12 schools and units, and works on communicating Harvard’s Title IX resources to students, faculty and staff at the University—a role that she says takes up about half of her work time. She also directs the Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution as it investigates formal complaints of sexual harassment at each of Harvard’s schools and divisions except the Law School.
A one-time employee of Bowdoin College and the Vermont Department of Education, Karvonides came to Harvard from the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, an agency whose rulemaking and guidance on Title IX she now helps Harvard to interpret and follow. From all her wide-ranging past positions, Karvonides identifies one connecting theme: crisis control.
“I think in most of my positions—I haven’t really thought about this before—but there’s been a component of crisis management,” she says. “Looking at things from a policy perspective, being forward thinking, but also having to put out fires, and responding to situations that are highly charged that may include traumatic experiences for individuals and doing it in a sensitive way and an effective way.” 
Karvonides arrived at Harvard in 2013 to do much the same.
At the time, Harvard seemed vulnerable. Its Title IX policies and procedures were not completely in sync with the federal guidance released in a 2011 “Dear Colleague” letter, which intensified federal pressure on colleges and universities across the country. As the federal government released its new guidelines, Wendy Murphy, a professor at New England Law School, filed a Title IX complaint against Harvard Law School, arguing that the Law School’s procedures and policy violated Title IX. OCR opened the case.
Arriving at Harvard after more than five years at OCR, Karvonides would have to move swiftly to review the situation and  formulate new policies at a nearly 400-year-old University that rarely enacts changes quickly. But it’s a role she says she relished.
“I wanted to see if this could be done well,” Karvonides, who emphasizes again and again that she approaches her job as a neutral investigator, says.  “If I got the position, I was going to be Harvard’s first Title IX officer. And so it was somewhat of a blank slate.”
In her first few months at Harvard, Karvonides says, she spent a lot of time “listening to people on the front lines”—meeting with members of each school who had fielded student disclosure of assault or harassment.
Much of what she heard, she says, was surprising.
“The thing that struck me, was there were so few people coming forward,” she says. “Really, I would talk to people that were here for 10 years, and they would struggle to come up with a handful of incidents of the times when someone came in their office to talk about these issues. So that was really striking to me.”
For Karvonides, the low number of disclosures—when a student talks to a Title IX coordinator about a case, even without necessarily filing a formal complaint—was concerning. With the advice of “front line” sexual assault experts across the University, she began to to formulate a new set of centralized Title IX policies and procedures at Harvard in the summer of 2013.
But as the University progressed along an incremental path to policy change, criticism of Harvard’s Title IX compliance exploded. The federal government launched yet another investigation into Harvard’s compliance with Title IX in April 2014, and a newly created University-wide task force began working to overhaul Harvard’s sexual assault prevention efforts. Students’ criticisms of Harvard were louder than ever.
Then, in July 2014, after a semester of seemingly unprecedented pressure and student frustration, Harvard unveiled the result of Karvonides’s months of work: a new policy defining sexual harassment at Harvard and an accompanying set of procedures for investigating cases of alleged harassment and assault.
Instead of a provincial model in which every school at Harvard investigated cases and defined sexual harassment in its own way, there was now a unified definition and centralized investigative model. The new policies would also bring Harvard into more direct compliance with federal guidelines—the school adopted OCR’s preferred “preponderance of the evidence” standard—as it contended with two federal investigations.
As Karvonides likes to recite, Harvard University now defined sexual harassment as “unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature” that is “sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive that it interferes with or limits a person’s ability to participate in or benefit from the University’s education or work programs or activities (hostile environment).” Almost a direct graft from the OCR’s 2001 Title IX guidance, the new policy would be enforced by the newly created Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute resolution, the investigative office that Karvonides now directs.
Just how the policy and investigation model would actually work remained to be seen.
Even with the University's new policy in accordance with federal guidelines, students who have filed assault cases have found that many challenges remain.
By the time Alyssa R. Leader ’15 formally disclosed her case, waiting was no longer an option. “I was really fearful for my safety,” she says over the phone.
Her lawyer is also on the line. Going public with her experience battling Harvard’s Title IX policies has shaped Leader’s life lately.
The culmination of that struggle came in February, when Leader filed a lawsuit against Harvard, arguing that the University had not properly responded to her complaint of sexual abuse and harassment. In the suit, Leader says she had been sexually abused across several months during the course of a “dating relationship” with a male student referred to in the suit as “John Doe 1.” Allegedly, the student then continued to intimidate and harass Leader in Cabot House, where they both lived.
In the fall of 2014, Leader first decided to take action.
Harvard students who want to talk to someone about an incident of sexual assault or harassment have an alphabet soup of options to choose from. Students who want confidential counseling from professional victim advocates can call representatives of OSAPR, the Office for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response. Or, students  can talk to the SASH (Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment) tutors assigned to each upperclassmen house (Freshmen are assigned  two Consent Advocate and Relationship Educators (CARE) proctors. Tutors and proctors serve as gateways to other resources. A student might reach out to peer counselors from RESPONSE or CAARE, Consent Assault Awareness and Relationship educators, who operate under the purview of OSAPR, or general counselors at the BSC, the Bureau of Study Counsel.  Students can also report sexual assault or harassment to HUPD—the Harvard University Police Department. 
Many of these organizations provide support, advise students on medical or legal action, and offer counseling. Alicia Oeser, the director of OSAPR, describes the approach as “nondirective.”
“I want to say, ‘Here are the options, here’s what it looks like, what is it that you would like to get out of this,’” Oeser says, describing how she someone from her office might advise a student. “But that is us asking some probing questions to help them realize what that might look like, and then give them the time and space to give them the decision that they feel most comfortable with.”
Official support measures, administrative sanctions, and investigations, though, flow through Title IX Coordinators, the Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution, abbreviated as ODR, and the Administrative Board.
ODR is one of the more recent additions to the list of student resources. Investigators from the office, which is growing after having remained understaffed for months, begin investigations after students, faculty, or staff have filed a formal complaint. Those investigators then determine whether there has been violation of the policy. Karvonides says about half of ODR investigations find some violation. ODR officers then pass along the ruling to the respective schools’ disciplinary boards, which determine sanctions.
Leader’s suit argues that she received inconsistent and confusing information from different administrators at different points in this lengthy process. She felt helpless and lost.
“Harvard is a leader in so many things, and they have an opportunity to be a leader in this area,” Leader says. “I certainly expected them to be, and they did not live up to my expectations.”
Harvard does not comment on pending litigation, but the University must soon respond to Leader’s complaint in court.
According to the suit, after running into John Doe 1 repeatedly in Cabot, Leader requested that administrators remove him from the House. No one she talked to, she says, helped her make that happen.
The suit charges that the resident dean at Leader’s House, Tiffanie Ting, told her she could not have John Doe 1 removed from Cabot. Back in the Smith Center, Emily Miller, the College’s Title IX coordinator, told her the same thing, according to the suit. So Leader took the next step: She filed a formal complaint with ODR in February 2015, launching an investigation into the conduct.
Leader says that when she requested  a no-contact order, an Ad Board interim measure that prevents students from talking to or approaching one another, she received conflicting and confusing advice. The complicated investigative process, Leader says, was devastating.
“It’s obviously extremely psychologically damaging,” Leader says. “You feel like less of a person, like you don’t matter especially when you’re ignored by my college—when you go to people and say you’re afraid for your safety and they just kind of shrug.”
Another source of frustration came from the office’s use of the now-abandoned definition of sexual harassment and sexual assault from the 1993 policy. Much of the conduct in question between Leader and John Doe 1 occurred before Harvard adopted its centralized policy and procedures in September 2014. So ODR used the previous policy in her case, not the 2014 unwelcome conduct standard, according to Leader.
Outside of Harvard, though, Leader found some reprieve. After Leader went to court, she obtained a restraining order and John Doe 1 was moved from Cabot House, according to her lawsuit. Doe and Leader graduated together in 2015, the ODR investigation—filed roughly three months earlier—still in progress.
Finally, on July 17, 2015, ODR ruled that John Doe 1 was “not responsible” for any of the allegations against him, according to the suit.
“Obviously, I completely disagreed,” she says. “To me, it was clear there was some sort of policy violation.”
But the process was not yet over for Leader. Regardless of how ODR investigators rule, the cases progresses to the Ad Board for a sanction ruling. So Aug. 18, 2015, per the suit, the Ad Board found a ruling of “Scratch,” an effective exoneration for Doe, according to the suit.
Leader says the decision did not surprise her.
“They were...extremely indifferent,” Leader says. “Despite the fact that I said, ‘I’m scared, I’m afraid for my safety,’ they didn’t do anything.”
The painful experience inspired Leader to sue Harvard. She hoped that it would attract public scrutiny.
“Obviously, my own situation was really frustrating and handled really inappropriately, but even more frustrating to me is that I graduated and I kept hearing about students who had similar experiences,” Leader says.
While the suit does not represent Karvonides by name, it does challenge her work: Karvonides helped create the very process that Leader described as long and discouraging.
Yet in many ways, Karvonides’s work is making a difference. The number of cases the ODR investigates has continued to increase, a signal that more students, faculty, and staff are coming forward. In its first year of operation, ODR heard 15 cases and about two-thirds through its second, it has heard 19 cases. For Karvonides, this is a clear sign of success when so many students had hesitated to come forward before.
And Karvonides says she hopes to decrease the time it takes to complete investigations.  “I am constantly examining the manner in which we do our work to identify ways to reduce the length of time to complete a case while not compromising on thoroughness, sensitivity to the parties, and equity,” she says.
While Leader remains the only student to have publicly filed a suit against Harvard, others remain skeptical about the way Harvard responds to reports of sexual assault.
Megan G. Jones ’16 is one such student. Jones decided not to report her assault both because it took place off campus and because she distrusted Harvard’s  investigative process.
“I didn’t want to take any kind of administrative action. And I think a lot of that motivated from the fear that it would be more dramatic than what I'd like it to be, that it would not work in my favor, that it would not be a fair, quick process,” Jones says.
Mike C. Ross ’16, who published an account of his assault in an article titled “Getting raped at Harvard: a guy’s experience” on The Tab in December, said he also chose not to report file a report.  He said that the “horror stories” he had heard from other victims were one of the factors discouraged him from pursuing a formal process.
“I have not heard of a good experience with the administration,” says Ross. “Even if I had in the first month thought to myself, I was to report this—which at no point did I ever—yeah, I would have been like, ‘Hmm, sounds like a bad idea.’”
Karvonides says that more education about the way Harvard’s process works will help build trust.
“The more people come forward that suggests to me that they’re knowledgeable, that we’re starting to increase trust, that they’re getting connected to people with expertise in this area that can better support them,” Karvonides says. “And that’s my ultimate goal.”
But even after the investigation ends and Karvonides’s work is over, there are places in the process where students can still be left feeling lost.
Every so often, John P. Finnegan ’16 runs into the student he says sexually assaulted him.  Though ODR determined that the student had engaged in unwelcome sexual conduct, the Ad Board decided not to remove him from campus, according to Finnegan.
“He’s still on campus, and I see him every so often. It’s kind of like the bogey man,” Finnegan, a former associate business manager for The Crimson, says. “He just exists—just when you’re walking around, he just pops up, and you're just thrown out of sync for the rest of the day.”
Finnegan is living one of the “horror stories” that scared Ross away from disclosing his assault. After ODR rules on a case, the school’s disciplinary board must still determine whether and how to punish the assailant. That part of the process, too, sometimes leaves students dissatisfied.
Finnegan chose to disclose his case and pursue a formal investigation. After he obtained a no-contact order, Finnegan said ODR investigated his case, and several months later, in May, they ruled that a policy violation had occurred.
A week after ODR finished its investigation, the Ad Board announced that it would  place the respondent on disciplinary probation, but not mandate withdrawal as Finnegan had requested, according to Finnegan.  Finnegan’s alleged assailant would stay on campus, he said, and the mark on his academic record—the only official public record of the incident—would eventually disappear.
“The message that it sent to me was that it didn’t really matter, what happened, and that I was expected to deal with it. And I guess I have,” says Finnegan, who describes feeling unsafe at night on campus.
“It doesn’t matter to me that he’s on probation, it doesn’t make me feel any safer on campus,” says Finnegan. For him, the sanction came as an “insult.”
“I mean, it’s less punishment than you would get if you had cheated on a CS50 pset,” Finnegan says.
Brett Flehinger, Assistant Dean of the College and Associate Dean of Academic Integrity and Student Conduct for the Ad Board, wrote in an email that the Ad Board weighs a number of factors in making such disciplinary decisions.
“In making any disciplinary decisions we are always weighing the significance of the action along with the particular details of the concern,”  Flehinger wrote.
Some students find the discrepancy between ODR investigation findings and Ad Board decisions  troubling. For these students, the benefits promised by the Title IX policy have remained out of reach.
“The issue is no one really knows who the Ad Board is and how they’re determining things,”Andrea Ortiz ’16 says.
Jessica R. Fournier ’17, a leader of the victim advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better, points out that many students only contact the Ad Board through their resident dean.
“If someone does not have a good relationship with their resident dean, that can be a huge problem,” she says. “I think resident deans also vary in their personality, in the type of training they receive, in how seriously they take these issues.”
Because the Ad Board also oversees the granting of interim measures, like academic extensions and no-contact orders, says Fournier ’17, this variation can result in inconsistencies and present roadblocks to students.
“It doesn’t seem sustainable to me to have a system in which so much depends on one person and their position,” she says.
Adam Muri-Rosenthal, the resident dean for Adams House, says that he and other resident deans approach disclosures “with great sensitivity to the victims.”
“I think that’s something that we as administrators are constantly trying to get students to understand,” Muri-Rosenthal says. “We want to support them in the best way possible.”
Finnegan feels like he chose the wrong path in dealing with his assault. Though the ODR confirmed that Finnegan lived in a “hostile environment” the Ad Board, says Finnegan, did not mitigate that environment.
“The lack of any meaningful response to that validation is almost more insulting than if they just said, ‘No, nothing happened,’” Finegan says. “I would have preferred to have not brought the case in the first place.”
The trek up to the ninth floor of the Smith Campus Center is a long one. When students come to see Karvonides—to discuss policy, to air concerns, maybe just to say hello—they pass two security guards and walk through a mechanized gate. An elevator ride brings them to the fluorescently lit hallway outside Karvonides’s office, where she says she maintains an “open door policy” to make time for students.
Reaching out to—and event debating with—students has become an important part of Karvonides’s role at Harvard. Not yet two years old, Harvard’s Title IX policies and procedures remain unfamiliar to many students. For Karvonides’s policy work to have an impact, she says, people need to understand it.
It’s not an easy task.
In a report released this week, a task force dedicated to studying sexual assault prevention identified a barrier to combating the issue on campus: Generally, students don’t know about or understand how Harvard approaches sexual assault.
“Based upon the AAU Survey and the Task Force’s outreach findings, it is clear that we have fallen short in making students aware of how sexual misconduct is defined, where to get help when sexual assault or other misconduct occurs, where and how to report incidents, and what is likely to happen after an incident is reported,” the report reads, referencing the sexual climate survey from last year.
The report recommended that Harvard mandate annual sexual assault prevention trainings for all  students, among other measures.
“The challenge is, how do you communicate it?” Karvonides acknowledges. “There are no magic words. There's no simple way to get that out and that's something that I feel that my office needs to work with students in those regards.”
For some students, though, the issue  extends beyond communication; several student activist groups, like Our Harvard Can Do Better and the graduate student group Harvard Students Demand Respect, have called for a wholesale change of the policy’s language. The policies may not be entirely set in stone, either. Earlier this year, a group of faculty, staff, and students began meeting to review Harvard’s new Title IX policies and consider making changes.
“The policy is written in an incredibly legalistic way that is not accessible to students, and really not accessible to anyone without a law degree,” says Fournier. Fournier and other students point out that the policy can’t be effective if it’s incomprehensible to those whom it governs.
Many students have critiqued how the policy addresses consent. In the Title IX policy developed under Karvonides’s leadership, a violation is defined by the standard “unwelcome conduct.” Karvonides believes this standard is exacting, while generous enough to encompass the wide range of possible violations that the policy must cover.
“The thing that’s important to understand is that our standard is not a higher or lower bar than those we see at other schools that have affirmative consent policies,” Karvonides says.  “I think we have a more nuanced approach to identifying what conduct is prohibited at Harvard.”
The unwelcome conduct standard, says Karvonides, allows investigators to capture and assess not just an assault, but the other forms of related behavior that often accompany it—including stalking and other forms of harassment. This is something she says is more difficult or impossible at universities where the “affirmative consent” standard separates assault from harassment.
Karvonides is open to talking to students, but she’s not one to quickly back down.  Last spring, student activists dropped their campaign for an affirmative consent clause in the University’s definition of sexual harassment after extensive meetings with Karvonides. 
Students are not the only ones wary of Harvard’s policies. Professors at Harvard Law School have publicly—in the pages of The Boston Globe and elsewhere—criticized both the language of Harvard’s policy and the way in which it investigates complaints, arguing that they were stacked against the accused. And the Law School followed through on their criticisms in a big way: They opted out of Karvonides’s much-criticized system and developed an independent set of procedures for investigating sexual harassment and assault. Some still want to change Harvard’s policy.
When the federal government found the Law School in violation of Title IX in December 2014, it, too, called on the University to tweak some of its Title IX policies.
Some students, frustrated by lengthy investigations and unclear policy language, no longer trust the Title IX policy and procedures.
Joshua D. Blecher-Cohen ’16, an intern at the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, says that queer and trans students find communicating with administrators about sexual assault particularly difficult. Though sexual assault disproportionately affects these students, Blecher-Cohen says that they are underrepresented in the policymaking process.
The sexual misconduct survey last semester found that 17.2 percent of  female, and 10.9 percent of male Harvard students who identified themselves as LGBAQN—lesbian, gay, bisexual, asexual, questioning, or not listed—reported experiencing nonconsensual contact involving physical force or incapacitation since fall 2014, as compared to 12 percent of straight female, and 2.7 percent of straight male undergraduates.
“If you feel marginalized because of your gender identity or sexual orientation enough times, then when you really need resources, or when you really need to be able to have faith that the University is going to help, then you’re stuck,” Blecher-Cohen says. “That’s really scary.”
Karvonides said she has prioritized addressing student concerns and confusion.
“My little mantra is knowledge and trust,” Karvonides says. “We need to constantly be looking at ways to increase knowledge and trust.”
To that end, Karvonides held the town hall in Emerson. She has also created secondary materials with students from the Undergraduate Council and Our Harvard Can Do Better. Last week, for instance, Karvonides’s office distributed pamphlets about Title IX policy to student dorms.
As part of its agreement with OCR, Title IX Office also released answers to of “Frequently Asked Questions”  in the fall of 2015. The 10-page document clarified—and in some cases, expanded—Harvard’s policy and procedures.
In particular, the document expanded upon how the University differentiates between incapacitation and intoxication—“Sexual activity following consumption of drugs or alcohol is not automatically deemed to be unwelcome,” it stated—and provided more explicit information about how investigations proceed. The FAQs emphasized the policy’s protection of academic freedom. After the policy came out, some Law School professors expressed concern that students could complain about language used in discussion of topics rape law.  It also introduced a “reasonable person” standard, meaning that a “reasonable person considering all the circumstances would find the conduct unwelcome and the environment hostile.”
Like the policy itself, the FAQ takes up the difficult dual role of complying with federal regulation and explaining complicated policy to students.
Ross, in his article in the Tab, wrote that the FAQ read as though “Kafka tried to write a guide to navigating sexual assault.”
“Every effort there is to make this a more clear, explained issue for students on campus, there’s like, ‘But who is the person who I can trust or talk to?’” says Ross. “Often the person you feel you can trust and talk to does not overlap with the administration.”
Karvonides has been working with students for more than a year to develop a second FAQ aimed at addressing lingering questions. According to Karvonides, the Title IX Office is in the process of “distilling and refining” the document.
Ross says that frustration with Harvard sexual assault policy has reached a tipping point. “I think this year has been really encouraging,” Ross says, pointing to the survey, the rally, and everything that came after. “I think basically, the ball is definitely in the higher-ups’ court.”
Frustration with the administration has prompted some students to seek closure elsewhere.
Ortiz and Eriko Kay ’17 plan to create an open-ended support group for sexual assault victims and allies, in response to what they see as the administration’s “disempowering” lack of transparency.
“We want to create this group for survivors and allies, because, currently, there is no one to turn to if you go through this experience,” Ortiz says. Ortiz envisions the group as a forum for victims of sexual assault and allies to meet and discuss issues of assault on campus, as well as simply a “safe space” for victims to socialize. 
Right now, Ortiz says, she and Kay are meeting with administrators to discuss the group and “get a lay of the land.”
“Speaking to people has been frustrating because I feel like a lot of heads of Houses and administrators and just people in power sort of applaud us for thinking of creating this community among students,” says Ortiz, “but the reason that it’s there is because the other systems that are supposed to be working are failing.”
Meanwhile, back in her office, Karvonides easily fills her days. She reviews investigations, meets with her staff, and strategizes about how to better present the policy she has worked so hard to create.
With almost three years, a policy overhaul, a blockbuster survey, and ongoing federal investigation under her belt, Karvonides shows no signs of slowing down. She wants to repeat the survey to gather more data and examine her office’s impact. She wants to hire more investigators. She wants more students to know, understand, and trust the policies and procedures she helped craft.
Karvonides emphasizes that ODR has already made tangible progress, citing the increase in disclosures since the office opened.

I’m standing in the chilly back collections of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, between rows of 72 life casts of Native American men of the Cheyenne, Arapahoe, Caddo, Kiowa and Comanche tribes. As Dr. Diana D. Loren tells me, these artifacts exemplify “special considerations” for curators.
The head-and-shoulders casts, taken from prisoners of war at Fort Marion, Florida in 1875, are arranged opposite one another at the behest of their descendants and contemporary tribal communities. A feather lies next to one, as per the Peabody’s policy of pairing descendants’ offerings to their ancestors with the relevant artifacts. They are kept in storage rather than permanent display, again at the request of their respective tribes.
Dr. Loren, who serves as director of academic partnerships and museum curator at the Peabody, explains that these busts were created for use in the 19th century discipline of phrenology, or measuring the human skull in order to develop theories about intelligence and behavior. Phrenology was based on antiquated archaeological preconceptions that certain races had different behavioral and intellectual qualities.
Loren discusses the difficulties of putting such “sensitive” objects on display in the museum. “Sensitive” is a frequently-used word in the world of ethnological and archaeological collections. As she explains, it applies to objects that are given special consideration because of consultations between a museum and the “community or descendant populations regarding a history and treatment of that collection.”

Although by no means legally prohibited from displaying the life casts, the curators of the Peabody are hesitant to put them on display because of their fraught history. This kind history, Loren elaborates, lies at the heart of modern ethnological curators’ work: “How do you steward a collection in the 21st century, that was created in the 19th century, with different goals in mind?”
These concerns also extend to the audience of a hypothetical exhibit featuring the busts. “What are people going to come away with when they look at this kind of collection?” Loren asks. “How do you make them stop and hear the story of the life experiences of these individuals?”
One of the only remaining insights into this story comes from the busts’ creator. They were made under the supervision of Richard Henry Pratt, best known as the founder of the controversial Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Carlisle, Penn., where Loren notes that “children were taken away from their homes and families.” Pratt’s personal legacy is equally controversial: He advocated throughout his career for Native American assimilation into U.S. society, and is commonly said to have stated: “Kill the Indian to save the man.”
In his autobiography “Battlefield and Classroom,” Pratt describes his work with the prisoners of Fort Marion. He had relocated them from the New Mexico-Texas border to Florida as an initial experiment in Native American cultural assimilation. At Fort Marion, he forced the prisoners to wear military uniforms, to speak English, to cut their long hair, and to perform military drills.
He writes in his autobiography, “There was some objection to these changes, but by kindly persuasion it was gradually accomplished.”
Pratt’s students may not have shared his optimism. On the way to the fort, his autobiography details an escape attempt by one of the prisoners, Gray Beard, who throws himself out of the train and is later shot as he tries to escape. Pratt recalls Gray Beard saying that “he wanted to die ever since being chained and taken from home.”
Through Pratt’s words, readers gain some insight into the circumstances surrounding the busts’ creation, and the associated issues of racism and cultural imperialism—clearly, a difficult story to tell. At the same time, it may be one worth sharing with museum-goers in order to understand the history of the Peabody, and of the field of ethnology, in all its complexity.
Still, some believe that the life casts should not be shown at all.
In general, the Peabody has made a significant effort to recognize and engage with its own history. The museum is an active collaborator with organizations set up after the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990, or NAGPRA. This act gives legal grounds to recognized Native American groups to repatriate funerary or cultural objects from museums and other organizations to the descendants. The Peabody has a full-time NAGPRA coordinator and has returned “2,361 individual remains, 154 funerary objects, one sacred object, 55 objects of cultural patrimony, and 18 objects that are both sacred objects and objects of cultural patrimony” to groups or individuals recognized under NAGPRA as of 2004, according to Loren.
Yet NAGPRA does not extend to the life-casts, which are not considered funerary or cultural objects. Will they ever find a home outside the Peabody’s back collections, either with their models’ descendants or on public display?
Moving forward, Loren says, the Peabody will continue to grapple with these issues, and “to work with [Native American] community members towards the co-development of knowledge. Recognizing there’s more than one story to tell.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While most undergraduates will be able to participate fully in Thursday's Housing Day, several popular classes have scheduled midterms during the festivities, putting a damper on some students’ plans.
Housing Day, a time when Harvard’s 12 upperclassman Houses welcome freshmen for a full day of fanfare, has long coincided with the peak of “midterm season,” since it comes at the middle of the semester and immediately before spring break.
Scott Ely ’18, chair of the Undergraduate Council’s Education Committee, criticized the practice of scheduling midterms on the eventful day.
“For a long time, the UC has been strongly in opposition to midterms on Housing Day,” he said. “We realize that this is a reality, but over time, we’ve seen the number [of midterms] decrease.”
Ely said Housing Day midterms are a chief target of the UC’s mission to reduce academic stress.
“This is a perfect example of how an inopportune placement of a midterm, test, or assignment can hurt the mental health of students here on campus,” he said.
Students with midterms scheduled on Housing Day expressed frustration at the conflict.
“I understand that I have to be tested on the material at some point, although I wish it was a different day, obviously,” said Billy A. Schmitt ’19, who will take midterms for Computer Science 51: “Introduction to Computer Science II” and Science of Living Systems 20: “Psychological Science,” both in the afternoon.
Schmitt’s instructor in SLS 20, Psychology professor Steven Pinker, has previously told The Crimson that the Thursday before spring break is “the logical time for an exam” and that “academic coursework is the raison d’etre of a university, and has to come first.”
Schmitt anticipates that the midterms will significantly affect his Housing Day experience.
“I’m planning on waking up early, going to my blockmates’ room, finding out, and then going back for some last-minute studying,” he said.
Schmitt also expressed concerns that his midterms will not only affect his own Housing Day.
“It sort of takes away the fun for my blockmates, [if] not all of us are there, and for my roommates as well,” he said. “If they want to have fun tonight, it’s a little bit of a buzzkill for me to be like, ‘Sorry, gotta go to bed early, can you turn the music down?’”
Some students were less upset.
“I’m not especially disappointed,” said Eli H. Davey ’17, who will take midterms for Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning 13: “Analyzing Politics” and Chinese 120b: “Intermediate Modern Chinese,” both in the morning.
“It’s one less chance to get smashed at 5 a.m.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Administrators are considering a fall 2018 launch for the revamped General Education program, according to Gen Ed committee chair Edward J. Hall, a move that could make access to the new program a possibility for current freshmen.
Details of how and when the new program—approved by a vote of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences last Tuesday—will be implemented have thus far been unclear. Hall said that he was optimistic a “concrete plan” would emerge by the end of the academic year.
Echoing FAS Dean Michael D. Smith, who said in February that he wanted students to transition to the new Gen Ed “as effectively and efficiently as possible,” Hall said it was important to implement the revamped program quickly.
“The current program is not living up to its aspirations,” Hall said. “Other things equal, the sooner we can replace it the better.”
The new program will reduce the number of required Gen Ed-specific courses from eight to four, in addition to adding three broad distribution requirements and a quantitative course, the details of which have yet to be determined. Students will also be able to take up to half of these courses pass-fail, a last-minute change to the legislation that came as a surprise to student leaders.
Hall said one of the limiting factors in launching the new program would be the time required to vet new and current Gen Ed courses to ensure that they fit under the altered categories and are consistent with the larger philosophical views of the revamped program.
“We do know that before we bring it online, even courses that are in the current program that want to stay in Gen Ed are going to have to go through some kind of careful re-assessment process,” Hall said.
Stephanie H. Kenen, the administrative director for Gen Ed, wrote in an email that before such a vetting process can begin, administrators will have to decide what criteria the would-be Gen Ed courses must meet to be part of the new program.
“We have to determine what the guidelines and standards will be for courses in the revised Program, and a workable process for reviewing them for inclusion,” Kenen wrote.
However, Hall said administrators know in part what to look for, given the school's experience with the first iteration of Gen Ed and the findings of a long review process.
“We actually have a pretty good idea of what it takes to run a really good Gen Ed course,” Hall said. “By this point, we have a lot of acquired lore and wisdom about that.”
Administrators will also need to ensure that students in the transition, who would include current freshmen if the program is launched in 2018, have “flexibility” in meeting their requirements, according to Kenen and Hall.
“We have to determine which requirements current and incoming students must fulfill and what courses they may use to fulfill them,” Kenen wrote. “We need to balance three things: fairness and flexibility to students; programmatic integrity; and administrative efficiencies.”
Pressure to implement the new program quickly, balanced with the need to ensure fairness in the transition, make 2018 “probably a good compromise,” Hall said, although he noted that there was still no “firm date” for the roll out.
“Longer in a way would be better because we could be more patient about the review process, but that also feels like it would be unfair to students,” Hall said. “We don’t want to delay that long.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Robin Kelsey, chair of the Department of History of Art and Architecture, will become the Dean of the Arts and Humanities division of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences starting in July.
Kelsey will succeed longtime divisional dean Diana Sorensen, according to an email that Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith sent to the Faculty on Wednesday.
“I’m thrilled to be leading a terrific division,” Kelsey, a professor of photography, said. “The faculty in the Arts and Humanities are immensely impressive, and being at the helm of the division is a great honor.”
The position of the arts and humanities has changed at the College and in the minds of students over the years, Kelsey said, emphasizing that he is excited to work with his colleagues in the division to address those challenges.
Over the past few years, University President Drew G. Faust has emphasized the importance of revitalizing the arts and humanities on campus, from engaging undergraduates in the Harvard Art Museums to launching the College’s new concentration in Theater, Dance, and Media.
Kelsey said he wholeheartedly supports the initiatives in the arts and looks forward to pursuing them.
“I think the place of the arts and humanities within the broader intellectual landscape of the College and the University is less definite than it once was,” Kelsey said. “I think there’s been a shuffling that has taken place, as the result of many factors, but all this means that we need to rethink what we teach, how we teach, and how we pursue our research, and these are exciting challenges to have.”
In his new role, Kelsey said he also hopes to foster faculty research and incubate new ideas and initiatives. In addition, he said he wants to include undergraduates and graduate students—not only faculty members—in shaping the future of the division.
“I want to ensure that our students feel that they are part of an intellectual community with a mission and shared interests, and find a way forward together from the top of this institution to the bottom,” he said.
Kelsey’s colleagues across the division, which comprises 15 departments in addition to many other degree programs, committees, and museums, praised his scholarship, leadership, and character.
“Robin Kelsey is a scholar of immense distinction, but he’s also a person who cares passionately about the corporate good, the collective good,” English department chair W. James Simpson said. “He’s got the skill and the energy to realize the collective good.”
Catherine McKenna, chair of the Celtic Languages and Literatures department, also emphasized Kelsey’s ability to bring colleagues together.
“I think that Professor Kelsey is a very wonderful scholar, and a talented teacher, and he’s, in my experience, a very congenial colleague, so I look forward to working with him as Dean,” McKenna said.
Kelsey will become the third permanent dean of the Arts and Humanities division, established by then-FAS Dean William C. Kirby in 2003. Maria Tatar, professor of Germanic Languages and Literature and Folklore and Mythology, was the first dean, and Sorensen formally took over the position in 2007.
In 2010, FAS announced Sorensen’s departure from the role. A year later, however, she returned as dean, after Smith asked her to hold the position for two more years.
In his email, Smith praised Sorensen’s focus on strengthening curricula, reaching out to students, and creating new programs.
“She has successfully advocated for departments and programs, and advanced new areas of scholarship, achieving progress even at times of significant financial challenge,” Smith wrote. “She leaves a formidable legacy and I am deeply and sincerely grateful for her leadership and her dedication to the mission of the Arts and Humanities division.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Francis J. Doyle III, the new dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, has spent his career studying large, complex systems as a “control theorist” in biology and chemistry.
Now, after a semester of acclimating to Harvard, Doyle is formulating a plan to make his mark on the vast and dynamic system that is Harvard engineering.
“I’m shifting gears from being almost a sponge and having to soak up the knowledge of what the place is all about and how things work to now operationalizing that knowledge,” Doyle said. 
Arriving at Harvard by way of the University of California at Santa Barbara—where he served as a dean for research at its College of Engineering and director of the Institute for Collaborative Biotechnologies—Doyle has taken the helm at a unique time in SEAS’s history. The school, a subject of skyrocketing student interest and enrollment, is planning a historic cross-river expansion to Allston in 2020 and enjoys a prominent place in Harvard’s capital campaign.
Doyle said that when he accepted Harvard’s offer, though, administrators kept quiet about some record-breaking news: a $400 million gift from hedge fund magnate John A. Paulson.
“They shielded me completely from that information. They wanted to have me make an unbiased decision with my career,” Doyle said of Paulson’s gift. “I will say it was the most delightful news that I received after accepting this offer.”
Doyle’s shortlist of priorities includes overseeing a smooth transition to the new Allston engineering campus, hiring new faculty, overhauling undergraduate research, exploring joint-degree and other “bridge-building” opportunities within Harvard, and fulfilling “unrealized targets” in the School’s portion of the $6.5 billion University-wide capital campaign.
Touted as a stellar fundraiser when he was appointed, Doyle has also been active on the development circuit as SEAS attempts to meet its “unrealized [capital campaign] targets” for “current use funds.” Though it has technically surpassed its campaign goal, the Paulson gift has been funneled entirely to the school’s endowment.
“I’ve made myself as open as possible to the needs of development,” Doyle said. “I’m finding that I can be very generous with the time that I can offer to development…. That’s really been a top priority.”
On the faculty front, Doyle has already hired computer scientist Cynthia Dwork from Microsoft Research and is in the midst of three additional searches—two for junior faculty and one for senior faculty. Despite the school’s desire to increase faculty, the lengthy search process and competition with “a very tough peer group” precludes rapid growth.
“You’re always duking it out with all of the other schools that are looking at the same candidates that you’re looking at,” Doyle said. “As we’ve risen in stature...that peer group has gotten more competitive, so now we’re duking it out with schools in the top 10.”
In addition to these agenda items, Doyle has one major project independent from administering SEAS: creating an “artificial pancreas” to revolutionize the treatment of Type 1 Diabetes.
In what Doyle describes as a “cruel irony,” his research group, which for over a decade has focused on developing the artificial pancreas, received $12.7 million in funding from the National Institutes of Health for long-term clinical trials in 240 patients. The trials are a crucial step in the commercialization process and widespread use of Doyle’s almost career-long project.
“Right at the point where the artificial pancreas is taking off and we’re doing massive clinical trials... I have less time to give to it,” Doyle said. “So it means I have to lean on the team to be a little more independent and pursue those things kind of with less of my time.”
Most of the members of Doyle’s research group moved with him from Santa Barbara to Cambridge. Joon Bok Lee, a graduate student in the group who moved from UCSB before his final year of studies, said that Doyle is an exemplary researcher and adviser.
“If you ask anyone in the lab, they will all agree that Frank is an ideal adviser to work with,” Lee said. “Why do you think I would’ve moved here with just one year left if I didn’t feel that way?”
Both Doyle’s research group and SEAS are enjoying unprecedented growth and interest. While SEAS’s undergraduate enrollment grows exponentially, its faculty grow gradually, and new office and lab space will be unavailable until the Allston move.
“We’re in a tough spot, because we’ve got this burgeoning enrollment of students, we have this wonderful growth in the undergrad population, a corresponding growth in interest on the graduate side,” Doyle said. “Until we go to Allston, we’ve got a bit of a space jam so we’re working with a zero sum like almost every other campus in the country.”
One of Doyle’s plans for serving this “burgeoning enrollment” is overhauling and expanding undergraduate research opportunities, calling undergraduate research an “unmet opportunity.”  Doyle did not rule out offering course credit for research experience, a practice in place at a number of peer institutions.
Another of Doyle’s priorities is identifying “joint-degree opportunities” and additional ways to collaborate with other Harvard departments. The school  is acting on this priority both inside and out of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences umbrella. Currently a joint-concentration proposal from German Languages and Literatures is awaiting approval, and Doyle has met frequently with Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria to discuss potential partnerships.
Though the Business School and SEAS won’t be neighbors until 2020, Area Dean of Bioengineering Robert D. Howe says Doyle is thinking deeply about the move.
“SEAS is going to be operating on two campuses with a large fraction of the people in Allston, but there’ll still be efforts here. How do you organize something like that?” Howe said. “I know he’s putting quite a bit of effort into thinking that through and putting in place the structures so that it doesn’t fragment, it remains coherent.”
Sunil Deshpande, a postdoctoral fellow in Doyle's group, said Doyle’s research acumen will serve him well in administration.
“As a control engineer, he plans ahead,” Deshpande said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The undergraduate-only Department of Visual and Environmental Studies could formally house its own graduate program for the first time in 50 years, should the Faculty of Arts and Sciences approve a proposed merger between VES and the Standing Committee on the Ph.D. in Film and Visual Studies.
Under the proposed merger, which was presented at last week’s faculty meeting, the standing committee would be dissolved and VES would offer a doctoral program in Film and Visual Studies. Non-VES faculty on the committee would be offered affiliate status in the department, allowing them to advise graduate students and teach classes in the program, sit on a new Film and Visual Studies Graduate Committee, and serve on exam and dissertation committees. A new Director of Graduate Studies position would take the place of the FVS chair.
The doctoral program was created in 2008 and focuses on the “study of the art and culture of the moving image,” according to a document outlining the guidelines for the merger. Since its inception, the program and its intellectual mission has enjoyed close ties the VES department, with, for example, its doctoral candidates serving as teaching fellows in VES courses.
“The program was essentially housed in VES, the program was administered by VES staff, and the program’s budget ran through VES,” said FVS standing committee chair Eric Rentschler, a professor in the Germanic Languages and Literatures department. “And so at the administrative level there really was a way in which FVS and VES were of a piece.”
Both Rentschler and VES department chair Robb Moss viewed the merger as a simple, uncontroversial clarification of an existing arrangement, but nonetheless highlighted some of the concrete administrative benefits and intellectual opportunities it could create.
“It just extends our intellectual reach,” Moss said on the introduction of graduate students into the department. “It takes the interests of the faculty, and expands it into new territory for us, [so] that we can think about the relationship between theory and practice in a different way—we can think about the ways in which our practice as artists, for example, intersects their deep interest in the visual world.”
Rentschler, on the other hand, pointed out that the proposed arrangement would perhaps make the search and appointment process for new faculty members in film studies easier. He recalled one instance when a senior faculty member that FVS had been courting—who Rentschler said would have been a “perfect” match—expressed concern that the program seemed like a tentative arrangement.
“We had run a search that had taken up to two years, and essentially this was just about to happen, but I think one of the sticking points for her was that simply Film and Visual Studies was in this liminal kind of situation,” Rentschler said. “If Film and Visual Studies had been in VES at the time we tried to make an appointment, I think we would have had a much easier time of it.”
The proposal was unanimously approved by the Faculty Council at its last meeting, and is expected to come before the Faculty of Arts and Sciences for further discussion next month.
“It really is just something that makes good administrative sense, good structural sense, and very good intellectual and programmatic sense,” Rentschler said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students conducting research and families touring the Harvard campus stroll side-by-side at a collection of scientific wonders in the Harvard Museum of Natural History. Inside the museum, visitors can explore exhibitions such as the Great Mammal Hall, featuring large skeletal structures and stuffed animals, and the Earth and Planetary Sciences Gallery, filled with rare gemstones and meteorites.
The Museum of Natural History, which serves as the public face of the University’s three research museums, displays a small sampling of the collections of the Mineralogical and Geological Museum, the Harvard University Herbaria, and the Museum of Comparative Zoology.
Graduate student David B. Westwood has toured the museum multiple times, noting that the well-recognized exhibits draw heavy foot traffic from outside of Harvard’s campus. But there is a side to the museum that is less visible to the public, and it is this dedicated collection staff working behind-the-scenes that ensures that the museum is constantly improving.
BEHIND THE GLASS
Perhaps one of the museum’s most beloved exhibits is the “Glass Flowers” gallery, which unites science and art.
Crafted by Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka over a span of five decades, the Ware Collection of Blaschka Glass Models of Plants boasts 847 sets of handmade glass models—630 of which have traditionally been displayed at the museum—consisting of 4,300 individual pieces.
The main exhibit is currently closed for restoration and is expected to reopen in May. This represents the first major restoration since the installation of the collection more than 100 years ago.
After a day spent carefully emptying the famous exhibition room, Jennifer Brown, collection manager of the Glass Flowers exhibit, said she is excited about the changes and the opportunity to rotate the content with greater frequency.
“[The previous arrangement] was very static,” she said, adding that the configuration of the cases in the room will be changed “to be more dynamic.”
“We are going to have more opportunities for movement and variety,” she said, noting that she was particularly eager to display the glass fern models that have previously been kept in storage.
The new display also aims to reflect trends in modern botany by arranging the models according to the classifications of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group of contemporary botanists.
The glass models will undergo restoration to treat cracks with archival adhesive, unlike the animal hide glue that the Blaschkas originally used. Delamination of the paint layers and glass will also be addressed, and the models will be cleaned gently with air and a soft brush. The exhibit’s conservator, Scott E. Fulton, who previously spent 27 years at the Peabody Museum of Archeology and Ethnology, will take care of the models.
“The objects are going to be just as interesting and enticing to people as they have always been,” Brown said. “But it’s going to be greatly improved.”
In the meantime, there is a temporary exhibit of glass flowers next to the gallery of glass sea creatures, which were also created by the Blaschkas.
“This is a kind of a fun opportunity [to join] these bodies of work together and tell this Blaschka story,” Brown said.
CURATING ACROSS SPECIES
The museum’s vast holdings have also provided ample opportunities for curators with a passion for animals.
Jose Rosado, curatorial associate in the Department of Herpetology at the Museum of Comparative Zoology,  reflected that animals have fascinated him since his youth in Harlem, where he frequented the American Museum of Natural History in New York.
“I used to see all these scientists, these people walking around with white lab coats. And that’s what I wanted to be,” Rosado said.
After college, Rosado worked as a curatorial assistant at the American Museum of Natural History until then-curator of herpetology at Harvard’s Museum of Comparative Zoology, Ernest E. Williams, recruited him to work there as collection manager.
“I had no intention of actually taking the job,” said Rosado. “I had a lot of knowledge of the problems that I had with [Harvard’s MCZ] in terms of loans and record-keeping and all of that. I just needed to find out who the devil was running the show.”
Rosado said that, during his job interview, he expressed his critiques of the museum and explained how he would remedy the situation.
“They were impressed, and they offered me the job,” he added. “It took them about six months to persuade me to come here.”
Rosado recounted how he modernized the MCZ collections. Now, specimens are stored in more effective containers, the infrastructure has been revamped, and much of the collection has been moved to the state-of-the-art Northwest Labs, according to Rosado.
Yet Rosado said he believes the museums should continue to improve.
“There are always new things that we discover. The collections are not static. They’re very dynamic,” he said. “People have this really misguided concept that all we do is sit here and store specimens.”
Rosado compared the museum collection to a living library that is constantly evolving with the development of new technology and research methods.
“The more our methodology improves in terms of getting information, the more information this collection actually provides us,” he added. “Natural history is fascinating. The amount of learning that is out there and the possibilities [are] endless.”

Thursday is a big day for Harvard’s Athletic Department. ESPN will likely be on campus, as will NFL.com. A horde of scouts will start their day across the river at the athletic facilities at 9 a.m.—all for the football team’s “Pro Day.”
Most years, the football team hosts a conditioning and practice exhibition for its top players so NFL scouts and the media can catch a glimpse ahead of them ahead of the NFL’s annual draft. However, a duo of high profile players has the athletic department expecting an unusually large turnout.
Strength and Conditioning Director James L. Frazier, who planned Pro Day this year, said the expected increase in media attention for the exhibition would put it in line with a season that has received heightened coverage more generally.
“Traditionally, Pro Day’s biggest challenge has been attracting interest in the event,” Frazier said. “This year, we have two big players, which has generated much more attention.”
Ben Braunecker ’16, who plays tight end, and Cole Toner ’16, an offensive lineman, are both seen as legitimate NFL prospects.
While Braunecker won’t participate in all the drills at Pro Day, according to Assistant Director of Athletic Communications Allison L. Miller, he will help attract attention to some of the lesser known players coming out. Miller expects in total 5-10 Harvard players and 3-4 athletes from smaller schools to attend.
“[Braunecker’s] performance at the [NFL] Combine has sparked a lot of interest and his appearance at the Combine has contributed to increased media and scout attention,” Miller said.
Unlike other football programs that regularly send multiple players to the NFL Combine—the league’s annual skills demonstration camp for top potential draft picks—the Crimson has a smaller presence at the Combine, and currently only counts seven total alumni playing in the NFL.
Miller said Harvard’s Pro Day originated as a means of showcasing the abilities of Harvard football players who may not have been invited to the Combine and can benefit from additional exposure and time with scouts.
As part of the athletics communications staff, Miller is responsible for notifying media outlets about Harvard’s Pro Day.
“We notify various media outlets about big time prospects in an effort to generate interest and coverage,” she said. “[It] serves as another opportunity to get our student athletes in front of media as they transition to a professional career.”
Miller predicted significant scout and media turnout this year, including ESPN, which she said is coming to Harvard’s Pro Day for the first time, largely due to Braunecker’s standout Combine performance.
Frazier has been planning the event for months, scouring Harvard’s database of scout information to compile an email list for invitations and determining the best date that aligns with other local teams’ Pro Days and the availability of Harvard Stadium’s own indoor practice “bubble.”
“We start by trying to figure out the best possible date, taking into  account considerations about the bubble, when are the other schools in the Northeast having their Pro Days, and the University’s spring break schedule,” Frazier said.
Frazier coordinates with Miller and the rest of the Communications department to invite scouts to the event.
Pro Day itself  is packed full of activities. Miller will go over the itinerary with scouts at 9 a.m., and then the scouts will meet with the coaches at 9:30 a.m. Then, the day’s program starts in the weight room with conditioning tests, before moving into the bubble for skill drills, which last for most of the day.
For Miller, the fact that Harvard’s athletes have the homefield advantage on Pro Day is not insignificant.
“I think our athletes feel comfortable and more focused here under the bubble,” she said.

Although businessman Donald J. Trump won three states in Tuesday’s primaries, his presence as the subject of Currier House’s Housing Day video was far less welcome.
Early this week, Currier removed a Trump-themed Housing Day video after several students criticized the video’s caricature of the business mogul as offensive and unwelcoming to undergraduates. In the original video, Currier resident Joseph P. Hall ’16 dons a blonde wig and pokes fun at Harvard’s other upperclassman Houses in the style of Republican front-runner Trump. 
Shortly after Currier residents screened the video, some students criticized the short, calling Currier’s affiliation with Trump—a polarizing figure whose campaign has launched verbal attacks against women and minority groups—offensive and alienating. Amid the controversy, Currier quickly removed the video, which Currier Faculty Deans and tutors had previously approved, according to House Committee member Katherine Barton ’16.
In the face of some student backlash, Currier Faculty Deans Richard W. Wrangham and Elizabeth A. Ross held what they said was an off the record town hall in Currier on Tuesday evening. Shortly following the meeting, many attendees stayed to film a second video that removed all references to Trump and featured a Bob Marley song with Currier-specific lyrics.
Although Currier officially renounced its connections to the parody, many students criticized the removal of the video.
Currier resident Aaron Grand ’18 said he felt the decision to take down the video was misinformed.
“The video clearly wasn't meant to be offensive,” Grand said. “It was meant to lampoon the guy that concerned students hate, and to take it down and having this massive outcry is a bit extreme.”
Some students argued that the removal of the video reflected a broader culture of political correctness.
“What is offensive about the video anyway, aside from the hairstyle? All that the immediate censorship does is show that we would rather maintain a stifling culture of correctness than have an honest discussion about issues,” Pforzheimer resident Fred Lu ’16 said.
In a statement sent over Currier’s House-wide email list, Wrangham and Ross wrote that they “appreciate that people with differing life experiences have different viewpoints,” adding that they were pleased to see lively debate over the video.
Still, many Currier residents said the video was hurtful, and lauded the town hall for its high attendance and participation.
Hall, the student who impersonated Trump, said that, although the video was made in good spirits, he is glad to see it replaced.
“I was asked by the House to do my Donald Trump impression, which was a product of a Halloween costume I thought was very funny and entertaining,” Hall said.
“I’m very sorry about the effect this video had on people,” Hall said. “I’m very happy Currier has found a new video to be the new Housing Day video, and I’m still very happy about the video Katherine [Barton] and I made.”
Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18, one of Currier’s Undergraduate Council representatives, said the video failed to properly account for the House’s ideological diversity.
“I personally wasn't offended by the video, but I definitely do see that the video wasn't so inclusive of all the political views on campus,” she said. “When we make a video about a House, we should try to make a video that encompases all views.”
“If anyone felt uncomfortable or marginalized, it shouldn’t be a video that is endorsing Currier House,” Paul Stainier ’18, another Currier resident, said.
Wrangham, Ross, and Avik Chatterjee '02, a race relations tutor in Currier, declined to comment on the Trump-inspired video.

The Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments’ new exhibit examining the history and influence of radio technology on American culture will open to the public on Friday.
Entitled “Radio Contact: Tuning in to Politics, Technology, & Culture,” the exhibition centers around the themes of tinkering, broadcasting, and listening.
The initial planning for the exhibit started about nine months ago. The exhibit was inspired by the large collection of radio items acquired by David P. Wheatland ’22, the founding curator of the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments.
Collection curator Sara Schechner expressed her admiration of Wheatland and his collection.
“He always impresses me when I go through the collection, that he had thought to save something,” Schechner said. “I was in a state of wonderment that he had... an exquisite talent for knowing what would be important in the future.”
There are about 100 objects on display in the exhibit, representing approximately ten percent of the material in the radio collection. Other featured objects were gathered from various sources including Harvard’s Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Florida International University’s Wolfsonian Museum, and the Hopi Radio station in Arizona.
Mia K. Metivier, an administrative assistant in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ Gen Ed program, researched and curated the broadcasting section of the exhibit. Although the objects on display have technical aspects and historical backgrounds with which viewers may be unfamiliar, she said that anyone could gain something from visiting the exhibit.
“We’ve done a great job of making it really approachable,” Metivier said.
Halsey Burgund and Michael J. Grasso ’97 worked on the listening section of the exhibit, which includes a six-speaker sound installation and interactive radio that fills the room with a soundscape called “Faint Earth Murmur.”
While the interactive radio’s exterior was created in the 1940s, the interior components were 3D-printed with modern technology. Visitors can tune the radio to different “stations” that feature themes such as news, politics, entertainment, sports, and music.
“You have this idea of being able to tune in and out of stations and listen to different things that are floating around in the air and this radio device makes them come to life in this magic way,” Burgund said. “When you have audio in here, it seems like all of the machines all sort of come to life.”
According to Schechner, the rich history of radio technologies was a motivating factor behind the exhibition.
“Radio is still alive and evolving. It’s had this very long and diverse history and it’s partly what we’re trying to capture here in this show,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Fresh faces and high expectations abound as Harvard baseball enters the 2016 season, its fourth under coach Bill Decker. The Crimson has increased its win total in each of Decker’s four years at the helm, including an 18-24 (7-13 Ivy) record last season. Led by perhaps the league’s top infield—as well as two top-line starters—and challenged by a rigorous non-conference schedule, Harvard will look to end up on the other side of one-run games, of which it lost seven in Ivy play last season.
After leading the league in almost every offensive category, the Crimson offense seeks to replace the production of infielder Jake McGuiggan ’15 and Oakland Athletics draft pick Mike Martin ’15 at the top of the batting order.
“It was evident that the returning guys did the work they needed to do over the summer and that continued until the bubble season,” co-captain DJ Link said. “Since we’re losing a lot, we’re going to need our returning guys to be that much better and then we’re going to need some of the freshmen to step into big roles.”
While freshman Ben Skinner will likely fill the void left by Martin in center and senior Mitch Klug will slide over to McGuiggan’s spot at second, Harvard will lean heavily on three returning starters from last season—sophomore right fielder Conor Quinn, junior shortstop Drew Reid, and junior first baseman Matt Hink.
Reid hit .280 as a sophomore and scored 28 runs in a breakout campaign. Despite a slow start, Quinn finished his freshman campaign with a .291 average and seven doubles. Hink will miss the start of the season with a hand injury, but the junior provides the Crimson with power from the right side.
One Harvard player who is poised for a breakout season is sophomore third baseman John Fallon, who saw limited action in a crowded Crimson infield last season. However, when he was in the lineup, Fallon showed glimpses of the talent that made him a highly coveted prospect coming out of Houston. He took home Ivy League Rookie of the Week honors after going 11-for-15 with eight runs batted in in a weekend series against Princeton and Cornell.
Link had a bounceback junior campaign in which he hit .308 in 28 games. Skinner, freshman Patrick McColl, sophomore Matt Rothenberg, and junior Josh Ellis figure to see time in the outfield and at designated hitter.
Harvard’s pitching staff is headlined by senior Sean Poppen and junior Nick Gruener, both mainstays in last season’s rotation. Both Poppen and Gruener won three games last season and averaged over seven strikeouts per nine innings. While last season’s team relied on its offense, the key for Harvard in 2016 will be balance.
Dartmouth, Penn, and Yale all boast deep starting rotations, and runs in Ivy League play are always hard to come by. Seniors Sean O’Neill and T.J. Laurisch anchor an experienced Harvard bullpen that will also feature sophomore Dylan Combs, co-captain Mike Sanders, and junior Kevin Rex, who is returning from an elbow injury.
The Crimson will play three weeks’ worth of road contests before playing its first games in Cambridge on March 27. Spring break will feature six games in Clearwater, Fla., against UMass and Army, teams against which Harvard went 5-2 last season.
“I think you come back to the Ivy League really ready to go,”Matt Sanders said. “In terms of seeing better pitching, it can be great for our hitters to go down there. It just really gets everyone ready to play when you come up North.”
Ivy play begins April 2 with a doubleheader at Cornell and a twinbill at Princeton the following day. Harvard took the first three games in this series convincingly last season, but fell in Sunday’s second game against Cornell.
“We’ve been right in a bunch of games,” Sanders said. “We have all the tools we need to be successful and hopefully having the seniors in the bullpen and some of the older guys in the lineup is going to help us in those one-run games.”
A pair of four-game series with Yale on the road and Brown at home precede home-and-home doubleheaders with Dartmouth, the eight-time defending Red Rolfe Division champion. Harvard has not stolen a game from the Big Green since 2012.
“While we’re not looking at last year’s statistics so much, it’s one of those things that we’re doing every little thing we can do to make sure those one-run games go our way” Link said. “The Ivy League is a grind. Sometimes it comes down to who wants it the most so it’s the little things that get you winning those close games.”
While the usual suspects will likely figure to remain atop the conference, this year’s Crimson team appears to have the mix of experience and youth as well as offense and pitching needed to to win the one-run games it lost last season. An improved pitching staff and a balanced infield have the potential to take the next step and bring Harvard its first winning Ivy League season since 2007.
“I think this year more than in the past, we have a pretty good balance of pitching, defense, and hitting,” Link said. “I really feel like we have guys stepping up now from both sides. It’s one of those things where we go live, you never know what you’re going to get.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
{image = 1313805 size=fullscreen caption = true align = center}
For all the talent that Harvard women’s lacrosse coach Lisa Miller has brought to Cambridge over the past few years, the one problem that she could not fix immediately was her squad’s lack of experience playing at the collegiate level.
Despite retaining only one senior last season and three the year before, the Crimson finally has a core of veteran players that it can count on in 2016. With six players in each of the junior and senior classes, the team fields an impressive amount of experience and hopes that the growing pains of previous years are now over.
“The lineup is more balanced as a whole,” said Miller, who is in her ninth season at the helm of the program. “There are things we’re doing in practice this year, more detailed and more complicated drills, that we haven’t been able to do in the past.”
The familiarity on the team begins with its leadership. The three co-captains from 2015 have all returned, along with the entire coaching staff, which means that players will look up to the same leaders for the second consecutive year.
With Audrey Todd leading the midfield, and defender Tory Waldstein and goalie Kelly Weis holding down the defense, Harvard has three seniors who understand how to direct the team. This expertise manifests itself both on the practice field and during game day.
“Everything feels more comfortable when we’re in practice,” Todd said. “People have a better sense of what they have to do, and it makes it really easy for the captains to make sure everything’s going according to plan.”
The Crimson, by virtue of graduating only one senior who played sparingly last season, returns each starter and goalscorer from last year’s squad. This team was good enough to finish tied for third in the Ivy League last year.
Junior attacker Marisa Romeo, after becoming the seventh player in school history to score 48 or more goals in her freshman season, looks to bounce back after an injury late last year cut her sophomore campaign short.
Despite missing the final three games, she still led the team with 48 points on 37 goals and 11 assists. As a result of her performance, she was named to the All-Ivy first team.
If Romeo can maintain her scoring pace from the past two seasons, she will move into the top 10 in the Harvard record books for both most career goals and most career points.
“Marisa is working her way back from injury, but she’s already been drawing the opponent’s best defender and even been face-guarded at some points,” Miller said. “I think it speaks volumes of the kind of player she is, even when she’s not 100 percent.”
On the offensive end, the Crimson also looks to Todd and sophomore midfielder Julia Glynn to provide the goals.
Glynn was another one of the Crimson’s three All-Ivy first team selections, being named to the All-Ivy second team as a freshman after leading Harvard with 44 points—27 goals and 17 assists—which is tied for eighth most assists in a single season in school history.
Meanwhile, Waldstein and junior defender Emma Ford lead the defense. Ford was the team’s final member of the All-Ivy first team in 2015, and recorded a team-high 35 ground balls. Waldstein, on the other hand, has been a stalwart for Harvard since freshman year, starting every single game.
In goal the Crimson calls on Weis, another one of the team’s four-year starters who arrived in the two large recruiting classes of several years ago. She, like Romeo, has school records in her sight, as she is already in the top ten for most career saves.
In 2016, Weis entered the season with 333; projecting her average performance forward, she is on pace to graduate as one of the top three scorers in the program’s  history.
“It’s good to know we have her in goal,” Todd said. “It gives the rest of the team confidence and definitely takes pressure off the offense.”
Weis and the rest of the defense will be crucial for Harvard against the potent offenses of several teams in the Ancient Eight, including defending champion Princeton and fellow title challenger Penn.
The Crimson will face the Tigers, who are currently ranked No. 6 in the nation, at home early in conference play. However, the team must wait until later in the season to battle the Quakers; then Harvard will travel south to Philadelphia for the matchup.
“They [Princeton and Penn] certainly set the standard for excellence in the conference,” Miller said. “But each game in the Ivy is tough and often comes right down to the wire. We have to be ready to battle every time out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

For the first half of the school year, there is only one thing that members of the Harvard men’s volleyball team can do: watch.
While women’s volleyball takes place in the fall, the men don’t start until the spring. This scheduling quirk creates a strange dynamic between the two programs. When one squad is playing, the other is cheering.
It was for this reason that members of the men’s team spent their fall witnessing the women’s team not just win a share of an Ivy League title, but also a first-ever appearance in the NCAA tournament.
Now, with the fall in the past, the Harvard men’s team has begun the hunt for its own unprecedented feat, namely a postseason conference title and an NCAA berth.
At 8-6 overall and 5-2 in conference play, Harvard stands at second in the EIVA. The Crimson has beaten St. Francis (then ranked No. 15 in the nation), Princeton (the only other Ivy school with a program), and George Mason (the squad that ended Harvard’s 2015 season).
But in 2016, as in every year going back to 1998, there is one opponent that outweighs all the others—Penn State.
“This is the year where we could really make a good tournament run,” captain Branden Clemens said. “I would love to have a chance to play Penn State in the EIVA championships.”
For the past 17 years, the Nittany Lions have claimed the conference title and thus the automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. The perennial heavyweights have won six straight against the Crimson.
This year threatens to be no different, as Penn State is undefeated in league play and ranked No. 6 in the nation. On February 12, the Crimson hosted the Nittany Lions and lost 3-0, partly thanks to a sloppy offense that posted a .179 hitting rate. Still, with a second matchup looming in early April, Harvard hopes to achieve the unusual through a combination of veteran leadership and sheer energy.
Now a senior, Clemens has shown flashes of excellence since freshman year, when he averaged 2.33 kills a set. Since then,  the outside hitter has racked up 10 career double-doubles, fine-tuned a powerful jump serve, and become a focal point for the offense.
The Crimson may thrive when multiple hitters get involved, but much of the fate of the season depends on Clemens’s play. So far he is delivering at the rate of 3.84 kills per set and a .324 hitting percentage, good for fourth and second in the EIVA, respectively.
“Earlier in the season, I was making more errors than I am now,” Clemens said. “I’m happy that I’ve reduced the errors because that’ll help my hitting efficiency and in the end help my team’s performance.
Yet Clemens isn’t the only veteran power Harvard has to offer. Senior outside hitter Alec Schlossman and senior libero Alister Bent provide additional experience. Meanwhile junior outside hitter Casey White has evolved into one of the best diggers in the conference—all this maturation despite a difficult 2015 campaign in which personnel issues limited the team’s potential.
“Last year was tough,” Schlossman said. “We struggled with a lot of injuries…. It was tough to get in a groove, but this year we’ve managed to stay relatively healthy.”
In 2016 “we” also includes a crop of six underclassmen that composes the bulk of the team and represents its future.
Since early 2015, sophomore Marko Kostich has run the offense from the setter position, racking up a total of 944 assists. Sophomore outside hitter Brad Gretsch has been a frequent recipient of these passes. A consistent second option on offense, Gretsch has posted at least eight kills in every game this year.
Only two players compose the freshman class, and both are middle blockers—Trevor Dow and Spencer Scott. Dow especially has impressed in the first half of the season, surpassing a .555 hitting percentage in each of the last seven games. While Dow shares time with a capable sophomore in Riley Moore, watching the rookie’s development will be a storyline to follow throughout the year.
Despite the profusion of young talent, the program squarely belongs to the class of seniors that has played three seasons without a conference title. In 2015 the Crimson qualified for the four-team playoff before falling to George Mason in four sets—Penn State took the crown as usual.
This season, the team hopes to parlay its hot start into a historical accomplishment.
“I think this team can beat the Penn State team this year, Clemens said. “That’s a goal.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Colleen Burke’s first day of practice with the women’s lacrosse team this past fall was hardly typical.
She had no trouble figuring out where to go, no doubts about what to expect, and even had a close friend to rely on through the process—a friend who was none other than her older sister, Marina.
For years Colleen had watched team practices, ever since Marina, now a junior on the squad, began her recruiting process. Harvard’s coach, Lisa Miller, still remembers seeing the younger Burke sister for the first time when she was only a freshman in high school.
“I was attending of one of Marina’s soccer games—she was also great at that, by the way—and I saw one of her speedy teammates, [Colleen]... win a penalty,” Miller recalled with a chuckle. “And I watched as Marina, who was supposed to take the kick, let the freshman have it.”
In the four years since, both of the players on that field have arrived in Cambridge to suit up for the Crimson. The two are the first pair of sisters that Miller can remember coaching for Harvard, and the sisterly duo often reminds Miller of that early soccer game when she saw them both in action.
A FAMILY AFFAIR
Jordan Field isn’t the first place where the Burke sisters have played together extensively. Neither is the soccer field where Miller watched them.
In fact, the two siblings have played together since elementary school, whether on the same youth, school, or club team.
“We’ve always been a big sports family,” their father, David Burke `83, explained. “We started them [Marina and Colleen] off in softball, and then later on, they were playing soccer together in the fall and lacrosse in the spring.”
From a young age, the sisters’ parents, who are former field and ice hockey players, encouraged their children to play sports. However, it was the sisters’ older brother, Brendan, who provided special motivation as the family transitioned into high school and college.
A year older than Marina, Brendan is now a senior forward for the ice hockey team at Amherst College. Both Marina and Colleen remember hanging around the rink as children and seeing the work that allowed Brendan to become the first child in the family to play college athletics, and both were inspired by his effort.
LIKE SISTERS
One of the main reasons Colleen found it easy to commit to the Crimson was that she already knew the team through Marina. Living less than 30 minutes away in Westwood, Mass., the entire family often watched Marina’s games during her freshman and sophomore years.
Colleen had the chance to meet and become friends with many of Marina’s college teammates. These bonds have helped Colleen find comfort this season and eased her transition onto the team.
“Having them around helps me stay focused but also relaxed,” Colleen said. As time has passed, Colleen’s comfort with the team has extended to her classmates as well.
“Colleen came in and became good friends with the freshman, and of course she knew a lot of the upperclassmen already,” Miller said. “Through Marina a lot of the juniors and seniors have been able to get closer to the freshmen, almost like older sisters themselves.”
Because the squad has been very young over the past two years, with only four seniors graduating during this period, most of the upperclassmen have known each other for a long time. There’s a level of familiarity among those players that has taken years to develop.
Luckily for the freshmen, one of their own has been around the team for just as long to find that familiarity herself.
“The relationship between Colleen and Marina is really cool to see,” said Nicole Baiocco, another freshman on the team. “It works great for them, and it works even better for the team.”
With two seasons to play together for Harvard, the Burkes are eager to see what they can write in yet another chapter of their partnership. The two will be working together to hold down the defense for the Crimson this year as the squad pushes for a high finish in the Ivy League.
In the meantime, they will be looking to do what they always have: play, relax, and improve side by side.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s volleyball team is off the bench.
Donning crimson libero jerseys or normal white shirts, clutching half-filled water bottles or nothing at all, team members stand in a rough line, clapping and hooting above each other’s shoulders. The atmosphere signals pressure and importance—that this lively moment is the one that will determine the outcome.
But there’s a slight problem—it’s only the first point of the match.
For a sport that requires only five players a side, involves no violent collisions, and often takes place in converted basketball gyms, men’s volleyball sure knows how to fill a court with noise.
The game action is relatively quiet—aside from thwacks and orderly whistles, it’s easy enough to hold a conversation with a seatmate.
But the torrent of shouts, smacked hands, and sideline roars begins when the points end. Then on the bench, players high five and shout encouragement. On the court, anything goes.
“As far as the celebration stuff, it just comes out naturally,” senior outside hitter Alec Schlossman said. “We’re excited to be playing together.”
This culture of excitement is not unique to the Crimson. Indeed the tradition of bench members not actually using the bench is common to most levels of volleyball, from high school teams to national programs.
The same goes for on-court interactions, and half of the thrill of watching volleyball is witnessing the ritualized congratulations that players exchange after points.
Yet this year’s Harvard squad takes special pride in staying active. At a minimum, there is the vocabulary—one of the most frequent descriptions of the team is “high-energy.”
“As I’ve been talking about all season, we’re a high-energy team,” captain Branden Clemens said. “We’re able to stay crisp and clean and execute well. Having that combination with the high energy is pretty tough to beat.”
After every point, win or lose, the players on the court circle in the center. They slap hands, pat backs, and exchange brief words before returning to their positions.
Part of the energy is a function of the team’s size. At 11 players, the men’s volleyball program is one of the smaller teams on campus, and according to Clemens, this affects community.
“We’re genuinely happy to see ourselves do well and see our hard work manifest itself in good play,” Clemens said. “There’s such a passion and desire to win that you kind of feel it.”
The acoustics of volleyball games amplifies these emotions. Unlike other spring sports, volleyball takes place in a gymnasium, which captures every kind of noise. This is why it’s almost always possible to know that the Crimson is playing a match by standing outside the Malkin Athletic Center and turning an ear to the sky.
On the court, the energy of the Harvard team sometimes goes nuclear during especially heart-pounding junctures. In these cases, everyone has his own strategy.
Clemens typically crouches down—which shaves a few inches off his 6’6” height—and pops his eyes wide open. It’s a wild look, and over the past four seasons, it’s become synonymous with key point victories.
Sophomore Marko Kostich may be the most excited of the bunch. As a setter, he needs to stay vocal to organize the offense, and he remains this way afterwards, shouting encouragement to teammates or just simply shouting.
“Point won or lost, he’s always yelling,” Schlossman said. “He’s very high-energy—it’s great.”
Per Schlossman, the team never plans any celebrations; whatever you see on the court is something players thought of an instant before.
However, during film sessions, Crimson players like to point out especially strange reactions on either side of the net.
Junior outside hitter Casey White is another player with noticeable excitement. Like Kostich, he stays loud throughout the match and specializes in the chest bump.
“He’s one of the people who loves to do big celebrations,” Clemens said. “[He and Marko] are both really good leaders on the court without even having a leadership position. I’m really happy with that.”
So far in 2016, high energy has led to early wins, as Harvard has climbed to second place in the EIVA. Even in defeat, Harvard has pushed opponents to the limit, as half the team’s losses have come in five sets.
Some might read this statistic as evidence of grittiness, but others might read it the way Clemens does—that this year’s Crimson is a strange case of celebration causing success, not the other way around.
“The energy is not just being hyper, but it’s also a constant energy,” Clemens said. “It’s believing in yourself while also being hyped up.”
I feel like it manifests itself in our ability to come back from tough situations,” he added. “Every time we get on the court, we’re genuinely excited to play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off an 18-24 season and fifth-place finish in Ivy League play, the Harvard baseball team will have to rely on a stable of talented freshmen if the group is to qualify for the NCAA Division I Baseball Championship for the first time since 2005.
The Crimson welcomes 12 members of the class of 2019 to the squad, a number of whom will be asked to contribute in various ways as the team looks to improve on last year’s 7-13 finish in Ancient Eight play.
Coach Bill Decker bolstered his core of pitchers during the most recent recruiting cycle, bringing in a couple of arms that he hopes can help get big outs and eat up innings for the Crimson.
Chief among them is hard-throwing Kevin Stone, a graduate of Fairfield College Prep. The three-time All-Southern Connecticut Conference selection was chosen this past week to feature in Harvard’s starting rotation, showing Decker’s confidence in the 6’4”, 210-pound freshman who hails from Stamford, Conn.
“I want to be a mainstay, a household name on the team,” Stone said. “When they think of Harvard baseball… I want people to say, ‘Yea, Kevin Stone is a big part of that team.’ I want to be a team leader.”
Stone was clocked in the high-80s during his high school career and is now throwing between 89 and 92 miles per hour. Relying on a two-seam fastball that runs in on righties, he uses a slider as his out pitch and mixes in changeups to keep hitters honest.
He was also one of the first members of this class to commit.
“I committed verbally the fall of my junior year,” Stone said. “I had done a Harvard winter camp my sophomore year, they watched me in the spring, and then they invited me back for summer camp, and I did really well at the summer camp. My velocity was up, [and] I had good results on the mound.”
Stone credits his Jesuit education for instilling intangibles in him, something he thought the recruiters found invaluable. They seem to have left an impression on his teammates, with fellow freshmen voting him as their representative on the team’s Captain’s Council, which includes two seniors and one member from each class.
This past weekend, Stone made his debut against Towson, completing four-plus innings with three strikeouts in a Crimson defeat.
Joining Stone, likely out of the bullpen to start, is fellow right-handed pitcher Simon Rosenblum-Larson. The Madison, Wis. native, who holds alma mater Madison West’s career records in innings pitched, earned run average, and strikeouts, was a two-year captain for his team and earned All-City honors as well.
A couple of freshmen will also see a significant portion of playing time on the diamond at other positions, notably first baseman Patrick McColl and center fielder Ben Skinner.
With a recent hand injury to projected everyday first baseman Matt Hink, McColl has been given first-team opportunities, and has already featured heavily for the Crimson early in the season. He collected six hits in 14 at-bats to start his career at the recent tournament hosted by Wake Forest. He also drove in four runs during this stretch.
“It’s fun coming in,” McColl said. “It was tough at first getting used to the high level of competition because you don’t see it all the time in high school. But once you get used to it, it’s fun to compete since it’s fun to be at the same level as these guys right away.”
With his 6’6” frame, McColl was brought in to command the infield and swing his powerful left-handed bat, one that produced a .431 average in his senior season at Los Altos High School.
McColl has gotten the opportunity to work with Hink over the course of the fall and winter and looks forward to the chance to continue to do so.
“It’s real nice,” McColl said, “We can kind of go at it but he can teach me things along the way, since I’m a new guy coming in and he’s been there for two years.”
Skinner, also hailing from California, is another one of the highly-touted prospects in the freshman class. Heading into the season, center field was a bit of a question mark, and the rookie seems to have played his way into this slot. During the team’s recent trip to North Carolina, he started all four games.
The speedy righty, Campolindo High’s defensive player of the year, led his team to two North Coast Section Championships in his four years.
Joining Skinner and McColl in the field will be former Harvard-Westlake infielder Chase Aldridge, infielder Trent Bryan, outfielder John MacLean, infielder Edwin Owolo, and outfielder Patrick Robinson.
Rounding out the class of 2019 are catchers Devan Peterson, Jake Allen, and Rey Pascual. With captain DJ Link and junior Josh Ellis the team’s first choice men behind the dish heading into the season, opportunities may be somewhat limited but there are still high expectations for all three going forward.
“We have a great clubhouse atmosphere, a great clubhouse vibe,” Stone said. “Getting even closer to my teammates, to play as a family, playing as a unit, will be key to our success. I want to look back at the end of the season and say, ‘Hey, this is our family, and I can’t wait to get back at it in the fall next year.’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

It’s difficult to choose the right epithet for the 2015-2016 Harvard men’s basketball team.
Disappointing? Sure, fourth place didn’t seem in the cards a team that entered Ivy League play ranked second in the conference in Ken Pomeroy’s rankings—on the doorstep of the top 100. The five straight losses—two where Harvard blew a double-digit lead—that followed a conference-opening win spanned the gamut from heartbreaking (Columbia) to numbing (Penn). The team’s seniors had seven Ivy losses in three seasons before seeing five in three weekends; presumptive Ivy League Player of the Year Justin Sears basically shrugged after beating Harvard for the third straight time on its own floor, calling it just “another game.”
An analysis like that is almost disingenuous, however. At its peak, this team pushed top-10 foes Providence, Kansas, and Oklahoma to the limit—throw in a win over BYU and Harvard demonstrated a peak on par with Crimson squads of the past. Four wins in five games to close the season brought Harvard exactly to where prognosticators thought it would be. Had a free throw or two gone down in February, Harvard might be one of only two teams in the league to claim wins over Columbia and Princeton.
Given the recent past and the rapidly approaching future, then, maybe the best way to see season is as an interregnum.
I don’t mean to suggest Harvard will be the clear league favorite next year—after going 12-2 and bringing its entire rotation back, Princeton has earned that right. Yet, the future looks as bright as it ever has for Amaker’s Crimson.
The good news starts up top with the return of Siyani Chambers ’16-’17. The senior, who withdrew after suffering a torn ACL early in the year, will be the de facto leader of a team that will still be very young. Barring massive improvements over the summer, freshmen Corey Johnson, Weisner Perez, and Tommy McCarthy figure to be part of the rotation alongside incoming four-star recruits Chris Lewis and Bryce Aiken. How Amaker manages the minutes of his backcourt will be one of the season’s most important storylines.
Inside, junior Zena Edosomwan is poised to take yet another step forward after falling four rebounds short of averaging a double-double and earning a second-team All-Ivy selection in his first season as the focal point of the offense. With quality big men around the league (Penn’s Darien Nelson-Henry, Brown’s Cedric Kuakumensah, Columbia’s Alex Rosenberg, Sears, and Yale’s Brandon Sherrod) poised to graduate with no obvious replacements, Edosomwan should compete for the mantle of the league’s best frontcourt player. The graduation of the team’s frontcourt depth—seniors Evan Cummins, Patrick Steeves, and Agunwa Okolie could all play the four capably alongside the junior—only accentuates how important he will be to the squad.
Nowhere will this dependence be more pronounced than on the defensive end. Most of what’s been written about Edosomwan this season—these pages included—has focused on his improved offensive game. Blame the availability heuristic (Harvard fed Edosomwan ad nauseum at times) or the more obvious improvements on the offensive end, but the junior’s biggest contribution to the team was as a defensive anchor. Teammate Agunwa Okolie may have won the Defensive Player of the Year award, but it was Edosomwan who carried the team’s best defensive rating by a county mile. His domination of the defensive glass never got enough credit this year, nor did his ability to protect the basket.
If Edosomwan can routinely stay out of foul trouble, the ensuing squad may be a defensive juggernaut. Sophomore Chris Egi struggled in limited minutes this year but showed promise as a help defender—as a starting frontcourt, the pair may break school records for blocks and free throw percentage. Chambers is an underrated defender at the top of the key and a possible ascension of Andre Chatfield to the starting lineup will give the Crimson the lengthy wing defender it needs.
The good news for Harvard isn’t matched around the league. Yale and Columbia, two of the league’s three best teams, will see their lineups decimated by graduation. Brown and Penn lose their offensive focal points, while Dartmouth and Cornell appear stuck in their yearly offseason cycle of promise-cum-disappointment.
Of course, predictions nine months out mean almost nothing (ask Chip Kelly). But with a mixed season in the rearview mirror, Crimson fans have a good reason to turn their focus to a bright road ahead.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This Saturday, the No. 7 Harvard men’s lacrosse team (4-1) looks to rebound as it faces off against Penn State (4-2) at Penn State Lacrosse Field. The last time the two teams faced off, the Crimson squad earned an early lead against the Nittany Lions, maintaining a close lead throughout most of the game before finally widening the margin at the end of the third quarter, resulting in an overall 12-9 victory.
However, with home field advantage this time around, Penn State may have a slight leg up on Harvard in what is certain to be a grisly battle between the two teams.
The Crimson is coming off of a tough loss against Bryant (4-2) this past Tuesday night with a final score of 12-9.
While Harvard held the lead at the end of the first half, putting up six goals and only giving up four, the tide quickly turned after the intermission. In the second half, the Bulldogs started to fight back by winning more face-offs and outshooting their opponents, ultimately overcoming the deficit and taking the lead.
“We look at the loss as a learning opportunity,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “It was a game that we did not execute as well as our game against Duke or the other wins, but you look at why, then you apply those lessons and we come out better at our next practice.”
While the loss for Harvard may have bruised its morale, it came just three days after the team managed to defeat then-No. 4 Duke in a 14-9 upset victory.
Led by senior attackmen Devin Dwyer and Morgan Cheek, the squad came out swinging in the first half, establishing a 10-5 lead. After an even scoring second half, Harvard not only pulled off the win, but also walked away with a 4-0 record, the first time since 2002 that the team has had such a successful start to the season. Looking forward to Penn State this weekend, the Crimson hopes to sustain its momentum from the hot start in spite of the hiccup that occurred Tuesday night.
“We just look at every team as our next competition,” sophomore attackman Jake Scott said.  “We don’t really focus too much on who we’re playing.  We focus on our team and practice, translating that on game day, and we have trust in our preparation.”
This preparation is thoroughly complemented by Harvard’s strong contingency of seniors.  There are currently 15 seniors on the roster, whose leadership has paved the way for the team’s successful record thus far and will certainly be a major asset in the upcoming game against Penn State.
Dwyer in particular has sparked the Crimson offense, which is averaging just over 11 goals per game as a unit. The veteran has 16 goals on the season, followed by Cheek with 10 through the first five games. With two goals and an assist against Bryant, Dwyer has tallied a point in 38 consecutive games with the Crimson.
“Our strengths are, in transition, our offense,” Scott said.  “If we win the face-offs and get the ball on offense, we will put ourselves in a really good position against [Penn State].”
While Harvard is recovering from its first loss of the season, the Lions most recently rolled to a 16-7 victory over Furman. Despite three close quarters, Penn State broke out in the third frame, outscoring its opponent 9-2.
The Crimson defense will be tasked with defending a balanced Lion attack. Against Furman, Penn State had six different players score two goals. The Harvard defense is averaging just over 10 goals allowed per game behind sophomore goalie Robert Shaw, who has started all five games in the 2016 campaign. Shaw had 17 saves on Tuesday against Bryant, which was the first loss of his career.
Harvard will need to play clean to get past Penn State, as turnovers and face-offs plagued the Crimson against the Bulldogs. Harvard turned the ball over 16 times compared to just 10 for Bryant, while the Bulldogs claimed 15 of 25 face-offs.
“Face-offs and possessions is something that we struggled with [in the game against Bryant] and is an important focus,” Wojcik said.  “Penn State is a really good team.  They’ve had a great start to this season, so I think it’s going to be a tough game.  We’re going to have to be ready going down there and play really well to be successful.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An excerpt from the Harvard athletics mission statement reads, “Harvard values the lessons that have long been taught by athletic participation: the pursuit of excellence through personal development and teamwork.”
For Harvard coach Jenny Allard, values like these are what she looks for in recruiting a new freshman class.
“We are... looking for kids that are looking to be true scholars,” Allard said. “I think beyond that we look for people... who want to come in and make Harvard softball the best program it can be.”
Allard added significant depth in the infield, with the addition of rookies Meagan Lantz, Erin Lockhart, Rhianna Rich, Kaitlyn Schiffhauer, and Sarah Smith.
Even with only eight games played, Rich has shown what she can do at the collegiate level, being named Ivy League Rookie of the Week after her first weekend for the Crimson. She batted a team-best 9-for-16, and went on to hit two triples and a home run in Florida. The El Segundo, Calif. native was three-time first team all-league and the Pioneer League Most Outstanding Softball Player in 2014.
Lantz is the younger sister to Katherine Lantz ’15 who was a first team All- Ivy League player after both the 2014 and 2015 seasons. Meagan was three-time softball first team all-county for the Miami Herald, the 2015 Female Scholar Athlete for the Herald, as well as the offensive MVP for North Broward Prep.
Lockhart, who comes to Cambridge via Lincoln, Neb., has quite the resume from high school including, but not limited to, being named 2015 Nebraska State Gatorade Player of the Year. Lockhart was also named all-state in 2012, 2013, and was all-state captain in 2014.
Schiffhauer was a three-time first team all-league and Palo Alto Daily News’ Newcomer of the Year in 2011. Shiffhauer was also named the Cal-Hi Sports Spring CCS 2015 Scholar Athlete of the Year.
Shively, a catcher, was voted Varsity Freshman of the Year and second team all-region at North Paulding High School. She would go on to be all-state and first team all-region in 2012 and 2013.
Along with the infield group, Allard padded the pitching rotation with the addition of Kathleen Duncan, Nicki Nishizawa, and Sarah Smith.
Duncan provided nine relief innings in five appearances in the first weeks of the 2016 season. The New Jersey native also has three years of first base experience at the high school level.
Nishizawa, a mere 5,075 miles from her hometown of Aiea, HI, is a right handed pitcher from Punahou School, the same school President Barack Obama attended. Nishizawa was  first team Interscholastic League of Honolulu and an all-state honorable mention her senior year.
Rounding out the list is right-handed pitcher Sarah Smith from Somerset, NJ.  Smith was second team all-conference in 2013 and first team all-conference in 2015. In her first career appearance, Smith recorded a save after allowing a single hit in 2.2 innings of work.
Like all student-athletes at Harvard, they work just as hard in the classroom as they do on the diamond. The softball team has taken this aspect of a student-athlete’s life one step further—the players set a goal for their team to work for a 3.5 average GPA for the school year. Many of the freshmen have not found this benchmark to be restricting, but rather liberating.
“I actually think that’s really helpful to have that goal because you want to help the team by getting a higher GPA—it’s more motivation for you,” Smith said.
Last season, the Crimson was recognized by the National Fastpitch Coaches Association for having the fifth-highest GPA in NCAA Division I softball. The leaders of the team, like team captains Zoe Galindo and Morgan Groom, communicated early on what was to be expected from the freshmen.
“They have really set a tone, and followed the tradition of our team culture,” Allard said. “[The seniors] as a class are strong and really know what Harvard softball is about, what it represents.”
A common theme amongst the freshmen in discussing their transition to college softball was family. As most freshmen experience, there is a period during one’s first year of college of having to meet new people and figure out a way to balance class with extracurricular activities.
The freshmen softball players had the advantage of having a family on campus that they could go to for support.
“I think our freshman class gelled instantly,” Shively said. “Our group of freshmen not only play well together and enjoy each other’s company, but we’re just friends on the field and off the field.”
Not only were the freshmen able to come together as a group, but they also were instantly welcomed on the team.
Shively summarized the feeling of the freshmen as a whole when she said, “Basically the culture was one of a family, and I knew that if I was going to Harvard that I would be part of a family for the next 4 years. That was an opportunity that I couldn’t pass up.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Garden City, N.Y., despite being home to a population of just over 20,000 people, consistently produces some of the best high school lacrosse players in the country. Even so, few people could have anticipated that the small town would lay claim to a whopping five Top-25 recruits in 2011 and 2012. Harvard men’s lacrosse coach Chris Wojcik ’96 knew the long tradition of skilled players coming from the area, however, and made sure that he was in Garden City early and often in those years. His reward: four of the five star recruits.
“That town has a rich history of producing some very good college and pro players,” Wojcik said. “And Long Island in general, it seems like, every lacrosse program in the country has a footprint there or is trying to make one.”
Long stick midfielder Brian Fischer has since graduated, but the other three remain and will look to lead the Crimson to success as the group’s senior leaders this season. Attackman Devin Dwyer, ranked No. 4 overall by Inside Lacrosse in the prep class of 2012, will spearhead the Harvard offense, while classmates Sean Mahon and Stephen Jahelka will anchor the midfield and defense, respectively. In 2011, Inside Lacrosse rated Mahon the No. 4 midfielder in the country and Jahelka the No. 1 defenseman.
The trio is part of a senior class that stands at 15 strong and accounts for more than a third of the team’s 42-man roster. Together, these players have experienced what it is like to both exceed expectations and fall short of them. In 2014, they helped an initially unranked Harvard squad finish first in Ivy play with a 5-1 record and surge into the NCAA tournament for only the sixth time. The next year, however, the team started the season ranked No. 12/13 nationally but faltered, finishing with a 2-4 conference record.
Now, the members of the senior class have set their sights on redemption, and ending their collegiate careers with another Ivy League regular season championship. If accomplished, it would make this class the first ever in school history to graduate with multiple conference titles.
“I think a big reason a lot of the guys my year came here was to try to build a winning culture in a place that hadn’t always had one,” Mahon said. “We’ve taken steps in that direction, but I don’t think anyone is really satisfied with where we’re at yet.”
The team certainly has the firepower to accomplish this goal, and its push for the conference championship starts with the three Garden City natives. Mahon and Jahelka will serve as captains this year, but all three have been recognized on preseason watch lists.
Dwyer and Jahelka were named Preseason All-Americans by Inside Lacrosse, and were also two of nine Ivy players to be drafted into Major League Lacrosse. Dwyer was taken 46th overall by the Florida Launch, while Jahelka will play for the Denver Outlaws after being drafted 14th overall, which matches the highest a Crimson player has ever been selected.
“Stephen missed all but two games last year because of an injury,” Wojcik said. “It’s good to have him back, not just for his ability but also his leadership. As for Devin, the way I’ve always described him is that he makes the players around him better, whether it’s through his lacrosse IQ, his vision, or his wide set of skills.”
Beyond its large group of seniors, Harvard also boasts a talented sophomore class. Attackman Joe Lang, who was third on the team in goals (21) as a freshman last year, was recognized as the Crimson’s third and final Preseason All-American. Only senior attackmen Deke Burns (26) and Ian Ardrey (24) scored more, and both will be back alongside Lang once Burns comes back from injury.
Morgan Cheek, a fellow attackman who netted the game-winner against Villanova in Harvard’s season-opener, and goalie Robert Shaw, a former Roxbury Latin standout who won the starting spot from incumbent Bryan Moore during the preseason, are two of Lang’s classmates who figure to play key roles as well.
As for the class below them, most of the freshman will likely not see much playing time except for faceoff man James Sullivan, who was rated by Inside Lacrosse as the No. 1 player at his position in the incoming class, taking over duties at the faceoff X immediately.
“The learning curve will be steep for him, especially with him being at a specialty position,” Wojcik said. “But James is extremely driven to succeed and we think he’ll be up to the challenge.”
The Crimson also has four other players in the Inside Lacrosse Power 100 Freshman Rankings, including defenseman Marc-Antoine Pion and goalie Jack Corbett. With so many upperclassmen, however, the team knows that it has the experience to win at the very start of the season as well as at its pressure-packed end. Harvard has taken it to all challengers so far, claiming Inside Lacrosse’s No. 7 ranking.
Brown, the league co-champion last year, could pose a challenge to Harvard within the conference and features one of the country’s best players in Dylan Molloy. Molloy and the Crimson’s own Dwyer are the only two players in the country who rank in the Top 10 individually in both goals and assists per game. The last contest of the season against Yale looms even larger on the calendar. If both teams play up to expectations this year, the matchup against the Bulldogs could decide the Ivy title.
“You don’t win a conference championship or national championship in one game,” Mahon said. “Each game will be important to us, and we understand that we need to approach every single one as a chance to learn and improve to get to that ultimate goal.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Stephen Jahelka felt his Achilles tendon snap in his second active game of his junior year, he was forced into a decision that no player wants to make. With only one year of eligibility left in his college career and a multitude of opportunities in front of him besides playing Major League Lacrosse, Jahelka could either endure a rehab process that was expected to last more than a half year or simply call it quits.
“On the car ride home, it didn’t really occur to me how bad it was,” Jahelka recalled. “I called Pete, one of my old friends from high school who had also torn his Achilles, and what he told me was, ‘This isn’t only going to be a physical battle but [also] a mental battle—an extremely challenging mental one.’ I kind of just shrugged that off.”
Jahelka had overcome shoulder surgery the previous season, and he was confident that he could come back strong once again. This time around, however, the frustration set in early. As he struggled to come to terms with his injuries, he was also forced to think about why the sport he had played since he was four really mattered.
“It was when I was sitting around, not doing anything, that I realized how lacrosse had always been a way I could give my parents something to be proud of,” Jahelka said. “When that was taken from me for pretty much an entire year, it hurt a lot.”
Before long, he discovered exactly what his old teammate Pete had meant. Not only was Jahelka mired in a mental battle,  he was also losing it.
“Once I realized that, I was able to see the bigger picture,” Jahelka explained. “I was able to erase the pressure of making people proud. For the last six months, the focus was not to let the voices in my mind win.”
Luckily for Jahelka, the support system on the Crimson was set up to help him through his recovery process. Jahelka hails from Garden City, N.Y., a community that emphasizes youth lacrosse and has sent countless athletes to Harvard to play the sport. Since arriving in Cambridge in 2011, Jahelka has been a part of a lively Long Island presence on the team that includes fellow team captain Sean Mahon, leading scorer Devin Dwyer, and faceoff man James Sullivan, among several others. All of the players have known each other for years, dating back to youth—leagues and, of course, high school lacrosse.
“There wasn’t a single guy I remember who didn’t text me at some point during that process to ask how I was doing,” Jahelka said. “To have 42 of your friends as an unwavering barrier of support was absolutely incredible when I was in recovery. Especially Bobby [Duvnjak, a fellow defenseman], who was injured at the same time I was. They got me through it.”
Probably more than any other factor, family strength has been a common thread throughout the trials and tribulations of his lacrosse career. That connection only increased as his Achilles healed.
The support of not just one team but two allowed Stephen to turn his physical limitations into an opportunity to grow closer to those around him. Jahelka’s sister, Jacqueline, remembered how he involved his family throughout the process.
“He would call us and say, ‘I ran for a minute today.’ It was like we were right by him going through the process with him,” Jackie recalled. “And one of the first things he told me after the injury, I’ll never forget, was ‘Jackie, now I can watch all of your games.’”
For the Jahelka family, the strong bonds recently came full circle last Saturday, when the team suited up at Hofstra University to face No. 4/4 Duke in a neutral site game.
For Jahelka, however, the crowd was anything but neutral. His grandmother, who had attended Hofstra, mother, sister, aunt, uncle, and cousins, as well as high school friends and teammates, all came out to support him as the Crimson secured the 14-9 upset win, its first win over Duke since Jahelka joined the team. What made the victory even sweeter was that it came on the same field that Jahelka had played every year in high school for the state championship.
While he sat on the sidelines last season, Jahelka also had a chance to bond with his teammates in a new way. For every technique he couldn’t teach a teammate with an example on the field, for each piece of advice he couldn’t bark out from the center of the defense, Jahelka made up for it by being vocal from the sidelines, especially in practice.
“Some players fade into the background when they get injured,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “Stephen, though, not only remained involved with the team as a whole, but helped individual players improve. He was almost like another coach.”
This year, with Jahelka and Duvnjak back on the field, the Crimson defense has restored its backbone. This new cohesiveness has produced impressive results, as the unit held Duke, now the nation’s seventh-rated scoring offense, to a season-low nine goals last Saturday.
While Harvard has started the season 4-1 and has high hopes of bouncing back from a disappointing sixth-place conference finish last year, Jahelka knows that adversity will eventually hit. But perhaps more than anyone else, he also knows how to overcome it—how to lean on family and friends and come back stronger.
“I chose this school because I wanted to help build a program,” Jahelka mused. “I remember that all I wanted after four years was to be able to look back and say that I started something. We have a chance to do just that this year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard softball team (4-4) is two tournaments into its season after opening play at the JU Green and Gold Classic in Jacksonville, Fla., on Feb. 26. One week later, the team traveled to Georgia for the Eagle Classic.
“It is a lot of hard work—we have a lot of practices every week, but we makethe most of the time that we get together,” co-captain Morgan Groom said. “Weworked a lot on playing as a team on the field, supporting each other on the field and such. So we were really prepared, even though we are such a young team, to go into these two tournaments.”
“Our preseason feels like a long process when we are going day in and day out in the bubble and the football field,” co-captain Zoe Galindo added. “It is very trying and really helps build our stamina. What was nice about this year is that we were able to go outside in January and February unlike other preseasons.”
The Crimson welcomed a large freshman class of eight athletes, who have already proven vital to the team’s success this year. Freshman shortstop Rhianna Rich, who was recently named Ivy League Rookie of the Week, is batting a team-high .517 and has a .793 slugging percentage. The El Segundo, Calif., native has gone 15-for-29 at the plate in her first eight games, scored seven runs, drove in four runs, knocked two triples, and recorded her first career homer in Harvard’s first two weekends of play. Freshmen pitchers Kathleen Duncan and Sarah Smith’s performances on the mound also helped the Crimson to a 3-1 record on its opening weekend. Both Smith and Duncan anchored the Crimson in their debuts, with Smith allowing just one hit and Duncan just one run on four hits, earning saves for the team.
“Our freshman class is great,” Groom said. “With eight of them, they are definitely a very large, very vocal group, but they are absolutely awesome. On the field they don’t play like freshman. They come out there, and they play big. They play with a lot of confidence, which is great. And off the field, they are a really fun group of people, and they’re fun to hang out with.”
This pool of talented freshman joins a Crimson squad that finished as the runner-up in the Ivy League North Division for the third straight season last year. Harvard went 23-21 overall and posted a 13-7 conference record. On its home diamond, the Crimson recorded a dominating 11-3 mark. The young team will look to top its recent second-place finishes to come out on top of the Ivy League this spring.
“Overall, I am really excited to start...Ivy League season,” Groom said. “I think we have a really good team this year, and we should be able to compete very well with the other teams this year.”
Leading the team for her 22nd season as head coach is Jenny Allard, the Ivy League’s most tenured coach and one of its most successful. Allard boasts a 536-400-3 overall record, including a 252-102-1 Ivy League mark. Allard has headed Harvard softball for half of the program’s existence and been at the helm for all of the Crimson’s six Ivy League titles, each of its six 30-win seasons, and its five NCAA Championship berths.
Allard welcomes three new additions to her coaching staff this year. Assistant coach Nicole D’Argento joined the Harvard staff in July after spending a year as assistant coach and recruiting coordinator for Army. In August, Allard also announced the addition of Lacy Wood as her new top assistant coach. Wood\ comes to Harvard after serving as an assistant coach at Eastern Kentucky for three years and as volunteer coach at her alma mater Louisville in 2012. In February, Jenny Rohn was added to the ranks as a volunteer assistant coach for the Crimson. Rohn graduated from Western Michigan in 2015, where she was a member of the softball team for four years and a captain for two.
“Coach Lacy, Coach Nick, and Coach Jenny have been absolutely awesome,” Groom said. “They bring a lot of knowledge to the coaching staff, which is great, but [they] are also very, very supportive and very fun to be around especially on these long trips on the weekend.”
Harvard will travel to California to play in two tournaments over spring break—the Loyola Marymount Tournament and the San Diego State Classic II—and will have its home opener on March 29 against local rival Boston College.
“We are really excited to show people how well we have meshed as a team and are still excited to go and compete on the field,” Groom said.

Now that Housing Day videos have been released, and the best day of the entire semester is upon us, Flyby writers Sruthi and Brandon have set to the difficult task of ranking all of them (instead of, you know, studying for midterms).
1. Dunster: The House Awakens
Sruthi: Even though Dunster and Pfoho had essentially the same video this year, Dunster won out in the end. The video editing skills for this video were out of this galaxy (pun intended). That first shot with Dunster House in the middle of the desert was gold.
Brandon: Yeah, Star Wars seemed to be the go-to theme this year, but Dunster killed it with the video quality. I was halfway convinced that the Housing Video was coming out of LucasFilms studio. The moose at the end was the icing on the cake.
2. Pfoho: The Pforz Awakens
Sruthi: To be honest, picking between Dunster and Pfoho was the hardest decision. Pfoho’s great play on “The Pforz Awakens” was genius.
Brandon: I agree! Will Greenlaw’s cameo as Finn in the Pfoho video almost made me do a spit take the first time I watched the video.
3. Mather: Mather Be
Brandon: As a former member of an a capella group, I have to give Mather mad props for pulling off an a capella rendition of “Rather Be.” Plus, they went all out in the end with a full, high-school musical like dance routine.
Sruthi: Yeah, Mather definitely gets extra points for taking the time to arrange the song. I think using Rather Be was a great idea, and the lyrics throughout the song were great because they actually changed them to talk about the house.
4. Winthrop: All I Do Is Winthrop
Sruthi: Winthrop’s dancers are killin’ it, but the video could definitely have been way shorter. 7 minutes is a long time to dedicate to my procrastination. Props for using a song that fit the House name in though: All I do is Win(throp).
Brandon: I mean, you figure we all have the attention spans of ants by this point in the semester, so going with a super long video wasn’t the best idea. Their mascot was the redeeming quality—I could watch that lion dance all day long.
5. Leverett House: Housing Dreamz
Sruthi: The dream sequence was clever and took Leverett beyond the standard “music video” Housing Day video. Also, it was great to see a bunch of Leverett people get involved. The music video just seemed like a lot of fun to film. I’m not one to listen to Fetty Wap very often, but even I could tell this was well executed.
Brandon: Shout out to Flyby Writer Kamara for making it rain in the dining hall! But seriously, any house that went the Fetty Wap route automatically wins in my eyes. Plus, the vocals were good. Definitely better than some of the Fetty Wap emulators you hear at parties. Yaaaaaaaas.
6. Lowell House: Lowell Better Have My Letter
Sruthi: Drone footage gives Lowell lots of points. I feel like a lot of the same footage was used though so it got a little repetitive for sure.
Brandon: Tea-time in Lowell House never looked so lit before. It’s a shame that we’ll only get a year of Lowell Tea if we’re sorted into the house. The only reason we didn’t rank them higher is because of how misleading the clip about Lowell Steins was; that looked more like a party at Yale than one at Harvard.
7. Eliot House: Is It Too Late To Get Eliot House?
Sruthi: I was really impressed by the attempt to recreate the dancing from the actual video. The Flyby compers last semester made a music video recreating this same song, and so I recognize the difficulties that come with attempting those dance moves. That being said, it was a pretty average Housing Day video, and that’s why it ended up in the middle of the pack.
Brandon: Sruthi, we can actually never talk about that video again. My dancing was so bad… Considering that, you are totally right: you have to give the upperclassmen of Eliot House props for matching the pretty sick moves of the “Sorry” dancers. Speaking from experience, it is very hard to move your body like that, and I’m sorry we ever tried.
8. Kirkland: An American Musical 
Brandon: Nice save, Kirkland. The original Kirkland video was unsettling… Not Quincy Man-Penguin unsettling, but nerve-racking. As if I wasn’t stressed out enough with midterms—I definitely did not need a bunch of upperclassmen yelling at me. They got points for trying, though. But going for a Hamilton-spin when every other video went for pop songs? That was definitely one of the best decisions they could’ve made. It definitely bumped Kirkland up from the bottom of the list. I’ve been humming that tune all afternoon.
Sruthi: I’m going to admit, I haven’t seen Hamilton yet, but I really want to. After Kirkland’s rendition, that desire has definitely gone up. I agree with Brandon that not going for the classic pop song gets them points in by book.
9. Adams: Remix to Tradition
Sruthi: As a freshman, I feel like this video didn’t have anything that grabbed my attention out of the several other videos I’ve been watching the last few days. I would like to point out that the little kids in Adams’ video are positively adorable. The few seconds they were in the video were great.
Brandon: Were they twerking? I severely hope they weren’t twerking…  But I don’t know, I just wasn’t feeling the Adams housing video, and this is coming from someone who has prayed to the Housing Gods for Adams house.
10. Cabot: Hello
Brandon: I was waiting for someone to do a rendition of “Hello,” and Cabot finally came through. I LOLed when the main singer went off on that tangent about how far away the Quad is. I totally feel her—the Quad isn’t that far away. Plus, any video with a Rakesh cameo is cool in my eyes.
Sruthi: Okay so the star of Cabot’s video is Dean Khurana which is clearly a winning point. The issue with this one was it was a little static just because the song is so slow, but it was still a great way to show off the house.
11. Quincy DJ Qhaled
Sruthi: Yeah, I’m not sure if the Snapchat video route was supposed to be a new hipster technique for creating a housing video, but it didn’t work. For one thing, I couldn’t really hear what was happening in the videos, and I’m not sure I actually got to see anything clearly because of the quality.
Brandon: I agree, the Snapchat video was not the best choice. I was actually heartbroken to find out that this was Quincy’s official Housing Day video instead of their “Man-Penguin” episode. Seriously, it might have been one of the weirdest things I’ve ever seen here at Harvard (and that’s saying something), but at the end of it I wanted to see more. RIP Man-Penguin, and shoutout to whoever did the vocals for the video!
12. Currier: Trump?
Brandon: This one was so bad that it actually got taken down by the house. I get the Trump theme and all, but I guess people are so disturbed by the idea of him being president that a video revolving around him was just too disturbing?
Sruthi: Yeah I guess this was just too close for comfort? I like the facial expressions for the Trump actor. Those were definitely on point. But overall I just felt like this video spent more time hating on other houses than actually letting people know what Currier’s all about.

Now that March is upon us, deadlines for summer applications have either passed or are rapidly approaching, and many students already have jobs or travel plans lined up for the summer months. If you do not have any plans yet, you may soon experience, or perhaps already are experiencing the following five stages of grief:
1. Denial: “This can’t be happening”
This is the beginning of the grieving process. You convince yourself that the rejections you received were likely sent to the wrong person and if anyone asks, you do have a summer job. This is the point where you start working your blockmates and friends’ parents in a last-ditch effort to set something up for the summer. That is, unless one of your friends beat you to it.
2. Anger: “How does everyone else have internships?!”
You have now progressed to the second stage. If anyone mentions their summer plans, you immediately throw a stink eye and hiss. You are furious that everyone seems to have their lives together, except you. If job applications were still done on paper, we’d recommend burning your personal copies. However, given most things are computerized now, maybe just go with that extra slice of cake and dinner and leave the laptop alone.
3. Bargaining: “I’ll trade you my dog for this job”
At this stage, you may start brainstorming a list of valuables potential employers might accept. These could include clothes, free SAT tutoring, a swipe to the second floor of Annenberg, or even your $250 Ec 10 textbook — autographed by Mankiw himself!
4. Depression: “My summer will be the worst”
Here, you enter a deep abyss of despair. To accompany a good cry, we recommend a tub of ice cream paired with a movie like “The Wolf of Wall Street” or “The Internship” to remind yourself of what you won’t be doing (and the money you won’t be making ) this summer.
5. Acceptance: “It’s okay: I wanted to do nothing anyway”
Congratulations, you have made it to the final stage. You have finally accepted the fact that you do not have summer plans and that is okay. You’ll always have next year — maybe start the process earlier next time around?
