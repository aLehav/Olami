After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Feb. 22, the Harvard-Radcliffe Chinese Students Association hosted a panel discussion with 88rising, an up-and-coming media brand that features Asian and Asian-American artists. Following the discussion, The Harvard Crimson sat down with 88rising’s founder and CEO Sean Miyashiro to talk about what the company has overcome, and what’s in store for its future.
The Harvard Crimson: In an interview with Pitchfork, you described the initial idea for 88rising as VICE for Asian culture. What do you see 88rising as, and what is 88rising trying to promote?
Sean Miyashiro: If I look back, that’s how I thought of the company in the beginning, and that’s certainly changed. VICE typically covers a lot of different things, where we’re more on the creation side. Obviously, the music has really taken precedent in how people perceive us and what people are falling in love with us for.
It’s not easy to continually put out good stuff in music and evolve and stay on top. It’s very serious, we work on it every single day. I can’t see too far into the future, but I can say that our brand comes first, and everything that 88 is. We want to take our brand from more of a digital online experience, and transcend that into different mediums which include film and live events around the world. Those are things that are immediate aspirations. It’s all about moving our brand into different mediums.
THC: Speaking of film, I saw the promotional video of the 88rising crew on the Asia tour and I loved the chemistry between the artists. Can you talk about the dynamic between personalities like Brian, Keith Ape, and Joji?
SM: The chemistry is amazing. I think we’re super fortunate to have that kind of chemistry. It has all happened very naturally. We’re extremely fortunate, because everybody is obviously an individual, but somehow everyone has meshed really well together. Everyone really respects and loves and is passionate about what we’re doing. Whenever we get together, it’s a great time.
THC: What project or collaboration in the last year has got you the most excited?
SM: Music is one of the biggest and most influential things in the world. There are quite a bit of artists that we have, and all are starting to put out content that people love under one banner. One thing that I’m extremely proud of is how our music is driving so many positive thoughts around our brand, and people being proud of it.
We had a show in LA last weekend and there were 5500 people there. What I thought was really unique was that for all the opening acts everybody cheered their asses off for, even though they weren’t super familiar with the artists. Even though these are new artists, everyone was so supportive of everyone who is with us. The 88rising crew is really meaningful to people, and that’s one thing that I’m super proud of. It was a moment I’ll never forget.
Charli XCX, she came to the show, and she pulled me aside and said, “Dude this is a fucking moment.” So many people came up to me that day and told me that when they grew up, none of this ever existed. Now we can look to something and say, “This shit is cool.” When I was growing up, there was nothing to look to. No living breathing examples in entertainment or music or anything.
THC: 88rising represents an outlet where Asians and Asian-Americans can be represented in a way that is completely counter to the norm. 88rising members like Brian, Joji and Higher Brothers are so cool and on top of it. It’s really empowering to see that. It’s empowering to see a song about WeChat [a Chinese multi-purpose social media app]. It was empowering to see at my predominantly white high school how many people loved Rich Brian’s “Dat $tick.” When starting 88rising, was a goal of yours to give Asian culture a platform in a new media landscape?
SM: Yeah! When I started, I knew that there was so much cool Asian shit and I wanted to build a home for that. Over the last 18 months we’ve gotten Higher Brothers, Rich, Joji, and we’re signing more people. Everyone is like-minded and an individual and a star in their own right.
You know, Brian has a tremendously engaged Asian fanbase, they really love him. But it’s cool as you said, a lot of people love Brian. It’s all races and they’re coming from all over the world and supporting him. That’s how you know you’re really onto something. At our New York show there were so many non-Asian kids buying merch and immediately putting it on. It was just wild.
THC: I am only 18 years old, but it’s something I couldn’t have imagined a few years ago. Companies like 88rising are creating a world where the next generation won’t look at their Asian identity as something to be ashamed of, but rather as a badge of honor. 
SM: Thank you so much. Today meant so much to us. I really didn’t know what to expect, and it was really awesome. I’ll be honest, I was nervous last night. When I got to the hotel I had a little bit of trouble sleeping. I’ve never done something like this before. There were so many people that came. There was a lot of laughter, there was a lot of energy, and there were tons of questions. We went way overtime. Once we closed, so many people came to the front and spent time with us. It was special. I can’t sugar-coat it. It was very special, I’m still buzzing over it.
We just came off the back of thousands of people coming to our shows, but today was amazing because we were really able to have a dialogue with fans. Some of the people who came to the chat took a bus from NYC just to come to the show. My parents even asked me how it went. It was badass, I enjoyed it so much.
THC: Any closing thoughts or announcements you want to make to the fans of 88rising?
SM: Today was such an amazing moment for us, for being able to have a dialogue with such passionate and bright students at this amazing university. It was as much of a pleasure for us as we hope it was for the students. This year we’re gonna do a lot. We’re gonna work twice as hard. We just wanna keep making everybody proud.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

 The drums are tight, the panning work is superb, and the feelings remain present as ever on Car Seat Headrest’s “new” album, “Twin Fantasy (Face to Face).” It was early November of 2011 when Virginia indie rock band, Car Seat Headrest, put out the original “Twin Fantasy,” now “Twin Fantasy (Mirror to Mirror),” on Bandcamp. The original release was self-produced on a single laptop and although it has been called a cult-classic, “Twin Fantasy (Mirror to Mirror)” left much to be desired in terms of production. The re-recording has been titled “Twin Fantasy (Face to Face)” and comes backed by Matador Records. In many ways, the re-recording maintains their artistic vision, but now has a big label backup instead of lo-fi indie punk production.
While “Twin Fantasy (Mirror to Mirror)” was certainly a powerful statement, and filled with excellent lines and riffs alike, it is only now, with the release of “Twin Fantasy (Face to Face)” that the album can be listened through completely without need for pause. The new production is frankly stellar, with particular attention paid to equalization and panning work. Panning refers to the left/right balance used in production for stereo sound music. Often, good panning work replicates a live band setting, with each instrument balanced differently. The original “Twin Fantasy” was very poorly panned, with tracks like “My Boy (Twin Fantasy)” coming through nearly in mono. The re-recording of “My Boy (Twin Fantasy)” off of “Twin Fantasy (Face to Face)” is delightfully panned and balanced: The lead guitar creates a swirling and surrounding kind of sound as each note has its own distinct left/right balance. Although the riff itself remains unchanged between these two versions of the same song, the improvements in production are felt as the song has metamorphosed from another angst-ridden teen track into a mature and contemplative piece.
The track that has been most sonically transformed by the re-recording process is undoubtedly the album’s fifth track, “Nervous Young Inhumans.” The original 2011 track features a driving main guitar that gets repetitive rather quickly, with a light overlaid guitar riff. The 2018 edition keeps things much more interesting by having the main guitar alternate between two strumming patterns and replacing the guitar riff with a synthesizer. This new version is much more aurally dynamic, and is a real pleasure to listen to. “Nervous Young Inhumans” is one of the two tracks on the album that has been lyrically updated in the re-recording process. While the original featured a semi-spoken outro that waxed poetic on Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein,” the revamped edition has a longer outro that touches on the nature of good and evil and vocalist Will Toledo’s own experiences on tour. The new production sometimes makes the album feel more pop and perhaps less genuine, but it is here that Toledo proves that he is as serious about baring his soul as ever.
The album’s penultimate track, “Famous Prophets (Stars),” also differs greatly from its “Mirror to Mirror” counterpart, in both name and content. The new edition changes names from “Famous Prophets (Mind)” to “Famous Prophets (Stars)” and is six minutes longer than its predecessor. The instrumentation is more or less the same throughout each song, though the equalization is radically different. Equalization, or EQ, refers to how the frequencies of each instrument are accentuated or diminished. When properly equalized, each instrument should occupy its own niche range of frequencies, and thus sound distinct. On the 2011 cut of “Famous Prophets (Mind),” the drums are less well-timed, and they are not properly mixed, so they bleed into the bass line. On the 2018 edition, each instrument is very well mixed, such that none of the tracks bleed and each instrument occupies its own range in the EQ. As Car Seat Headrest rockets towards mainstream appeal and commercial viability, this type of high-quality production becomes par for the course.
While some may say that on “Twin Fantasy (Face to Face),” the group loses some of its lo-fi, DIY charm, it is readily apparent that the group has made a much better album with studio backing than with the single laptop approach. It will be interesting to see what comes next for the Virginia group, but after this stunning re-release, expecting big things seems only reasonable.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lawrence S. Bacow, recently announced as Harvard’s 29th University President, is no conventional academic. During his long career in the field of American higher education, he has held a mixture of academic and administrative roles. He served on the faculty of MIT for more than two decades, before moving to administrative positions at MIT as chair of the faculty and then chancellor. In 2001, he left those roles to become the president of Tufts University, where he served until 2011. Given this lengthy resume, Bacow has been described as a practical academic—a “pracademic”—who has built a career balancing his interests in administration and research.
Compared with his two immediate predecessors—University President Drew G. Faust and Lawrence H. Summers—Bacow has accrued more administrative experience before taking Harvard’s helm. Alternatively, he has published a smaller body of published research, compared to Faust, who was a Pulitzer Prize finalist, and Summers, who was a John Bates Clark medalist. This contrast in professional focus—Bacow has been removed from academia for over twenty years—could raise questions about his preparedness to take over as University president.
While academic attributes are crucial, we believe that it is equally if not more important for a University president to have prior administrative experience. While the leader of any university must be familiar with the world of academia, they must also have substantial and tested experience in administration. As Bacow fulfills both of these requirements, we believe that his experiences make him an ideal candidate to lead Harvard through a time of rigorous challenges and change.
As Harvard struggles with a lagging endowment alongside internal controversies such as sanctions on unrecognized single-gender social organizations, we believe that the president must be equipped to steer Harvard through the uncertain years ahead. The current faculty and administration undoubtedly possess the skills needed to overcome the University’s challenges, and much of that potential lies within Harvard’s academic productivity. To tap into these resources, we agree that Bacow must understand the inner workings of academia. His 24 years on MIT’s faculty are more than enough to establish this familiarity, which is unlikely to be forgotten by any length of hiatus.
Harvard’s presidency also entails a number of non-academic roles, from lobbyist to fundraiser to advocate for higher education. In all of these positions, a leader of the University must have experience in managing and representing schools at the highest level. In addition to his administrative experience at MIT, Bacow’s experience as the president of Tufts gives him the type of practical experience that no similar role could. In that position, he showed not only that he could balance the multifarious tasks at the helm of a major institution, but that he could do so while pushing that institution forward. Bacow exceeded all expectations at Tufts, heading a revolution for their financial aid and endowment.
Given this track record, and during these crucial moments in Harvard’s history, we require a practical administrator more than an accomplished academic. We believe that Bacow’s “pracademic” skills will allow him not only to succeed, but also to cut new paths in higher education.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
President Donald Trump’s nominee Kenneth L. Marcus awaits confirmation as the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Education. We believe Marcus has a track record of opposition to students’ civil rights that makes him unqualified for this position. He has supported Secretary of Education Betsy D. DeVos’s rolling back of key Title IX protections for survivors of sexual assault, opposed race-based affirmative action programs in public schools, and though he has expressed concern about “race and sex discrimination against white, male Christian students,” he has not expressed equal concern over harassment of BGLTQ students. Nevertheless, Eric D. Fingerhut, CEO of Hillel International, has chosen to endorse Marcus’s nomination. We believe that this decision was motivated by Fingerhut’s commitments to supporting Israel, but we reject his decision to prioritize that over the fundamental civil rights of students.
Marcus has committed to supporting DeVos’s efforts to roll back key Title IX protections for survivors of sexual assault, including access to accomodations from their universities to pursue their educations and freedom from direct cross-examination by an accuser. Marcus also supports DeVos’s guidelines to implement processes in which only the accused can appeal, and survivors are asked to mediate with their assailants. As Jews, we believe that students should not have to choose between standing with their Jewish community and standing up for the rights of sexual assault survivors and all students. This endorsement is especially disheartening given Hillel’s stated “longstanding commitment to help end sexual assault on campus” and past commitments to campaigns against sexual assault on college campuses. In the midst of the #MeToo movement, the responsibility for standing with survivors, especially in the context of pervasive sexual assault and discrimination on college campuses, is clearer than ever.
Furthermore, in his confirmation hearing, Marcus expressed reluctance about intervening in an instance of racial inequality in schools. He is a committed advocate against race-based affirmative action and equal opportunity programs. Additionally, in the hearing, he lacked an understanding of how gender identity is protected under Title IX discrimination law and did not actively commit to protecting the rights of students with disabilities. We call on Hillel members around the country to reject Hillel International’s endorsement of someone who will not actively intervene on behalf of our entire community. We know that identity cannot be compartmentalized, and failures to protect the rights of some identities to the exclusion of others breaks apart our community. Protections based on religion should not exclude protections for students of all sexual orientations, gender identities, and races, and abilities that are critical for us to thrive.
However, it appears that Fingerhut values a narrow approach to American Jewish dialogue and activity around Israel over all the other protections due to students. Hillel International’s endorsement calls him “an excellent partner and collaborative leader on these issues of critical importance to Jewish students,” specifically on “issues related to anti-Semitic activity and anti-Israel activity on college campuses.” These statements reference Marcus’s history of encouraging colleges and universities to classify calls for targeted divestment from Israel as anti-Semitic. We acknowledge that Jewish students have a variety of political beliefs about this issue. Prioritizing single-sided politics not only undermines Hillel’s values of open discourse in the Jewish community but also unacceptably jeopardizes all students’ civil rights.
We strongly support, as have the the Progressive Jewish Alliance and BAGELS, Hillel’s Jewish BGLTQ group, Harvard Hillel in upholding our community’s values of support and respectful disagreement by clarifying that Harvard Hillel does not issue or take part in endorsements of candidates for public office, including this one. We call on Hillel International members around the country to stand with students in opposing the confirmation of Kenneth Marcus, joining civil rights leaders including the NAACP, the National Bar Association, the National Council of Jewish Women, National Education Association, and the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.
Whether Marcus is confirmed or not, failing to act signals to students that a bureaucratic affiliation is more important than protecting the rights of students. In the the face of Fingerhut’s unacceptable endorsement, silence is not neutral, and the time to speak out is now.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Let me take you on a tour.
We’ll start at the heart of campus, right here in Harvard Yard. Turn to your right—no, not that right, your other right. Do you see it? It’s a beautiful church. Yes, the steeple is gorgeous and perfectly pristine. There’s a reason we’re starting here. This church defines the Harvard experience: Every year during Opening Days, the new freshman class gathers in front of its steps for Convocation. Four years later, that same class gathers here once more for Commencement. Even if a student never attends the morning services, Memorial Church is where the Harvard journey begins and ends.
Let’s turn away from Memorial Church now—there’s so much else to see, and you only have a few minutes. I know you might be surprised to see a church towering over this secular Ivy League campus. Don’t worry, you’re not the only one who divorces Harvard from religion. But while American millennials are the least religious generation yet, at least 60 percent of students in any given class at Harvard affiliate with some sort of religious tradition, from Mormon to Jewish to Muslim.
After today, you’ll realize that religion defines the Harvard landscape—both when you see it and when you don’t.
But come—let’s escape the Yard. If we make our way down Linden Street, the upperclassmen Houses will start coming into view. Adams House is all around us, and there up ahead is Lowell House, currently under renovation.
Oh, what’s that building, right in front of Lowell? That’s Harvard Hillel. The glass and unique architecture make the building distinctive, and there’s even a courtyard built within the structure. Yes, it’s not in the Yard, but it’s a prominent location nonetheless. Though it is open to all, Hillel serves hundreds of Jewish students on campus and there’s always kosher food available in the dining hall.
Let’s turn here. Do you see that steeple, right up ahead? That’s the Catholic Church, St. Paul’s. Almost one in five students in the current freshman class at Harvard are Catholic. The Catholic Student Association isn’t the only Christian student organization—it’s one of fifteen. If you go the other way, back towards the Quad, you’ll even find a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.
It’s easy to forget how much diversity of faith and religious practice there is at Harvard. Unfortunately, you won’t find much conversation about religion here, even though religious spaces are featured so prominently. And look—we’re back in the Yard. Let me show you something you missed the first time around. Yes, I know you see Memorial Church. But let’s walk past it and swipe into Canaday Basement. This is the musallah—small, carpeted, and clean. It’s the prayer space for Muslim students on campus. In fact, it’s the only religious space for Muslims on campus, who number in the hundreds.
I’m going to be honest—when I arrived at Harvard, I didn’t expect to find many Muslims here. By chance, I ended up in a suite with two other Muslim girls, and we found a community that was large, vibrant, and diverse. And my exposure to religion didn’t end there. I made friends with Mormon students who were committed enough to their faith to say “no, thanks” to Harvard and take a mission for two years to an unknown place (meanwhile, I am afraid to take a semester abroad because of my fear of missing out #fomo). I found my religious peers tackling tough questions, like evolution, abortion, and interfaith relationships.
But I also found that while religion towers over this campus, conversations about it remain hidden underground.
Many students at Harvard (even religious ones) simply don’t realize that a critical mass of their peers are constantly considering matters of faith—issues and beliefs that many associate with small towns and backwards counties. As you walk through this campus, you see that Harvard is a diverse place. In all of these spaces that you’ve seen, so many Harvard students engage in all types of nuanced and difficult conversations. These students are varied: some grew up in religious households and are now reconciling that past with their beliefs now, some are finding faith at Harvard, some are searching and floating and letting their beliefs grow. All of them are here, all around you.
Not all religious organizations or religious groups are as prominent as the steeple on Memorial Church. Look around the Yard. So many of these students, your friends and leaders and peers, lead lives inextricably linked with faith. Not all of them are as easy to spot as a girl with a scarf on her head. But they exist. We exist. You see it now, don’t you?
So reach out. Break out of your mold, and drop by a church or prayer space. Let’s talk about religion. We’d be happy to have you over, and you’ll learn a little bit more about the campus you live in and the students you live among.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s late at night on March 1, 2017. The midnight deadline is approaching fast, and I’ve been hunched over my laptop on my living room floor for hours. My fingers are flying across the keyboard in a frenzied effort to finish up the last few questions on my transfer application. The clock is ticking—it’s too late to edit now. I grit my teeth, and press submit with mere minutes to spare; it’s a shot in the dark. I’ll go back in the morning and realize the personal statement I wrote last-minute has nothing to do with the assigned topic, cry for a few minutes, and then console myself with the fact that I probably didn’t have a fighting chance with which to begin.
If you told me that night that exactly one year later I’d be publishing a column in The Harvard Crimson—let alone get accepted to Harvard—I would have laughed in both doubt and exhaustion-induced delirium. In truth, applying to Harvard was a spur-of-the-moment decision made to spite an ex-boyfriend who didn’t think I’d ever make anything of myself. That, coupled with the discouragement of an advisor at my community college, lit me on fire. Hell hath no fury like a woman doubted, apparently. I knew the statistics were grim; only about a dozen transfers are admitted each year, and I was pretty sure my very small, very rural community college wasn’t on Harvard’s radar. I didn’t even know anyone who’d gone to an Ivy League school. All I knew was that there were at least two people I needed to prove wrong. I didn’t give myself much time to think while I sped through my application, but once it was submitted, I wondered if I was taking things a little too seriously. Was I, in the infinitesimal chance I’d be admitted, prepared to leave my quiet, isolated corner of Virginia for urban Massachusetts? Could I survive in a city I’d never visited at a massive institution I knew almost nothing about? Would the pride of coming to Harvard be worth the struggle of transferring?
It was, but not at first.
On the surface, I hit the jackpot. I’d spent two years taking classes out of the same three buildings and packing my lunch every day because there was no cafeteria. There weren’t any restaurants or stores around campus—in fact, there wasn’t much of anything but mountains and trees. The lecture halls themselves were built into a hillside. Harvard was absolutely huge (and flat!) by comparison, and I was amazed by all the hustle and bustle; I’d spent a couple days in New York City when I was fourteen, and that was the limit of my exposure to city life. I was most impressed by the food. My first Harvard meal was a transformative experience, infinitely better than food out of a lunchbox or vending machine.
Harvard was at first glance everything I’d ever dreamed of, but the transition from small-town, small-college life quickly proved pretty difficult. My first day in Cambridge was symbolic for the comedy of errors my first semester would prove to be: I was running late for a transfer orientation dinner, and my parents, unsure of whether we were driving the wrong way down a one-way street, dropped me off on a sidewalk that was nowhere near where I needed to be. After a fifteen minute struggle to find my way to Dunster House, I got locked inside the courtyard and spent another fifteen minutes trying to find my way out.
Being so far away from home and living in such an unfamiliar environment was tough. I was embarrassed by my accent, I didn’t know anybody, and everyone already had established friend groups in which I just didn’t fit. I failed my first test so badly that I got a personal email explaining, in statistical terms I didn’t understand, how badly I failed (which prompted to me change my concentration—the first time). I fell through on most of my commitments and failed to maintain my budding friendships. I did the best I could, but the fear that I didn’t belong and never would nagged at me, and I continually questioned my place at Harvard. Ironically, being surrounded by so much life, activity, and opportunity made me wither.
By the time I’d scraped and crawled through the end of my first semester, transferring didn’t seem worth it anymore. I was a fish out of water, just trying to survive, and I wondered what had happened to that fire that led me to apply to Harvard in the first place. It took the entirety of the month-long winter break for me to gather my bearings and remember why I was here—or rather, why I even wanted to come here in the first place. My first semester had been overwhelming and sometimes flat-out miserable. The only sense I saw in returning to Harvard was that, instead of proving myself smart and capable to a couple of people that barely even knew me, I needed to prove myself wrong. I needed to prove that despite all the difficulties of transferring, I could survive and maybe even thrive here.
And so here I am. The initial adjustments are behind me and I’m having a little more success this time around. Coming to Harvard has been an invaluable experience, and I’d do it all over again, difficulties and all. It’s been hard, but that’s made it all the more worthwhile.

FM sat down with Michael C. Reid ’18 on a Friday afternoon to discuss his new student organization, the Crimson Consulting Club, a club created to consult other student organizations on campus. Following graduation, Reid will be taking his consulting skills to Bain, but he hopes this club will be his way of giving back to the undergraduate community. Reid is earnest and business-minded—and, unexpectedly inspirational. FM entered this interview ready to be amused and curious about the intricacies of meta-consulting. Reid, though, is more focused on the positive impact of strategy than he is on consulting other well-known student consulting groups.
Editor’s Note: This interview has been lightly edited for clarity and concision.
FM: First off, can you tell me what the Crimson Consulting Club is?
MR: Simply put, CCC is a student-run organization meant to provide strategy consulting for other student organizations and student businesses. It’s such an easy thing to expose [what consulting is] to students on campus, but at the same time help out a lot of other organizations.
FM: Are you aware that you have, essentially, formed a meta consulting club?
MR: What do you mean?
FM: Consulting within consulting—a club that consults other clubs and potentially other consulting clubs.
MR: I mean, honestly we could—yeah, it’s beautiful, right?
FM: What’s the next level in meta-consulting?
MR: What do you mean?
FM: Could you see yourself consulting Harvard College Consulting Group?
MR: I mean, yeah we could, if they need consulting.
FM: If you were to consult HCCG, what would you say to them?
MR: I’m not very familiar with them. I would never give recommendations to an organization that I just don’t know much about. Like, honest to god, I don’t know much about them. I’m not involved with them at all.
FM: Consultants are always talking about “deliverables.” Does CCC deliver? Could you deliver to my dorm? Even if I live in the Quad?
(Editor’s note: “deliverables” refers to the final product of a consulting project, typically a PowerPoint presentation.) 
MR: Yeah, we could! I appreciate the joke, it’s very hilarious. If you’re a leader of a student organization I could deliver to your dorm. It’s standard—it’s providing presentations on what they can do and how they can apply that.
FM: How many pennies exist in the city of Seattle? I’ve been told this is important information that consultants need to know.
MR: Couldn’t tell you.
FM: Could you quantify your level of PowerPoint expertise?
MR: Um, on a scale of what?
FM: On a scale of 1 to the most beautiful powerpoint you’ve ever seen.
MR: I’ve seen some really beautiful powerpoints; I’ve worked with some pretty amazing consultants. I mean in the context of me being in college, I thought I would tell you a 9 but then when I got to work and I saw [my powerpoints] in the context of a real company having real deliverable powerpoints—totally different. You can definitely get way better at it.
FM: What’s your strategy?
MR: I think my entire idea with CCC is that we don’t want other groups to be dependent upon us. My ideal situation is that we have no business because the entirety of Harvard’s campus is running efficiently enough, right? But the reality is that’s not the case. Maybe I have this too-grandiose of an idea and I think I’m too much of an idealist, but I really honest to God think that this could make Harvard’s campus better.
FM: Final question. Is there anything else you’d like to add?
MR: Honestly, I’d like to thank you. It’s students like you who have changed my entire perspective on the world, but aside from that, motivated me on a daily basis, making me reflect on my entire life. I think that at Harvard we are making society a better place, we are supposedly the future leaders of tomorrow. To have people like you who are so engaged with an organization that you reach out to me, is the kind of thing that drives the campus forward.

“For the umpteenth year in a row Economics 10, ‘Principles of Economics,’ led the list of largest courses taken at Harvard.” This reads like a Crimson headline from last semester, but in fact it’s from the Fall of 1978.
To the many undergraduates who take it, and the many graduate students who teach it, Ec10 is—for better or worse—a pillar of Harvard’s liberal arts education, perennially popular but  oft-critiqued. The history of the course shows that the unbound textbook used today, priced at $131, was not always how Harvard students got their start in the discipline of economics.
“Contrary to popular belief, Ec10 was never designed to be a pipeline for lower Manhattan,” says David W. Johnson, a former head teaching fellow who taught sections from 1980s until 2014.
Indeed, lower Manhattan was the furthest thing from Harvard’s original introductory economics course, Economics 1. According to a 1896 syllabus entitled “Lectures on Economic Development,” students were required to read books on topics ranging from philosophy to anthropology. This interdisciplinary focus meant students had to consider why economic history was a useful topic of study.
Only three professors have led the course since the 1960s: Otto Eckstein, Martin Feldstein, and N. Gregory Mankiw. All were, at some point during their careers, either members or chairs of the government’s Council of Economic Advisors.

Starting in the 1960s, the curriculum began to focus more on giving students the tools to evaluate public policy. Lectures heard during the Cold War included Soviet Economic analysis. Otto Eckstein, the professor who taught the course until his death in 1984, considered different economic perspectives throughout his tenure. In 1979, students spent the first few weeks alternating between chapters written by classical economists and chapters writen by Karl Marx.
Under his tenure, the course name changed from Ec10 to Social Analysis 10 in 1977. But Eckstein, an advisor to Lyndon B. Johnson, became so associated with the course that he earned the nickname “Otto Ec-10.”
It was under his successor Martin Feldstein, though, that the curriculum began to resemble what it is today. While allowing students to use any mainstream textbook, he abolished separate sections for math-oriented students and for “radical” economics in order to make the sections “more homogeneous in ability and political interest.” He added guest lectures to increase variety.
Feldstein, who taught the course for 20 years, found that a pluralistic curriculum was impractical for beginner students. “Ec 10 doesn’t teach Marxist economics or Austrian economics or the economics of Catholic Social Teaching,” he says. “Those belong in a more advanced course on intellectual thought.”
One goal that has remained consistent throughout the course’s presence at Harvard is that Ec10 aims to help students become educated citizens, and to better reflect contemporary concerns.
“I used to begin the first lecture by showing a copy of the New York Times front page where there was usually a story that one could understand only after taking Ec 10,” Feldstein says.
When N. Gregory Mankiw became chief lecturer in 2005, the course name changed back to Ec 10, and content from the previously yearlong course was split into two semesters: one for microeconomics influenced most by the 18th-century Scottish Economist Adam Smith, and the other for macroeconomics, influenced by 20th-century English economist John Maynard Keynes.
But the most substantive recent change to Ec10’s curriculum came after the Great Recession, when economists realised students needed to know more about financial institutions and monetary policy, and the role both played in the unfolding crisis.
“The main draw of Ec 10 with most students continues to be the chance to equip oneself with the tools to design and implement better public policy,” Johnson says.
Elmendorf believes the course achieves this goal, particularly through its inclusion of guest lecturers. “Not everybody understands economics is about an array of social issues before they start Ec10, but they do once they finish,” he says.
However, some professors and students disagree, instead arguing the course should cover a wider scope of approaches to economics. Stephen A. Marglin is one of these professors. Marglin taught an alternative economics course, USW 17: “A Critical Approach”, until 2010. “The main problem is that Ec 10 teaches one perspective on the economy, one framework for understanding how the economy works, why it fails, and what to about the failures,” he said.
To counteract this, he spent “two-thirds of his course teaching alternative approaches which were also valid,” including different interpretations of Keynes’ work that criticise whether increasing market competitivity will lead to better economic outcomes.
Criticisms reached a head in 2011, when a group of students, inspired by the Occupy movement, decided to stage a walkout in the middle of an Ec 10 lecture.
“Mankiw is not doing a fair job representing economics. Rather than a difference between alternative or mainstream, the idea that this is the mainstream is misleading,” recalls Gabriel H. Bayard ’15, who organized the event.
Rachel J. Sandalow-Ash ’15, another organizer, worries that students won’t get to learn contrary perspectives at all during their time at Harvard because “many students are not Economics concentrators and won’t take more than two courses.”
In an email, Mankiw responded to criticism that the course doesn’t teach a pluralism of approaches. “Ec 10 includes a significant number of guest lecturers. The guests offer students a sense of the range of perspectives and approaches among leading economists,” he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Congressman and civil rights leader John R. Lewis will come to campus to speak at Harvard’s 367th commencement ceremony, the University announced Wednesday.
Lewis will address graduates during the Afternoon Program of commencement, which will take place in Tercentenary Theatre on May 24.
Lewis, a decorated icon of civil rights in the United States, has represented Georgia’s 5th congressional district for over 30 years. He was one of the “Big Six” leaders who organized the March on Washington in 1963 and he helped lead the 1965 march across Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala. Lewis was awarded an honorary doctorate of law degree from Harvard in 2012.
University President Drew G. Faust said in an interview with the Harvard Gazette that Lewis is an inspiration to the world and praised him for his service.
“For more than 50 years, John Lewis has dedicated himself to the ideals of equality and decency, standing up for what is right, even when it meant putting himself in harm’s way,” Faust said.
A native of Alabama, Lewis joined the Civil Rights Movement at a young age and continued to fight for equality across numerous demonstrations, at times persevering despite physical injuries like a fractured skull. He became involved in politics as a member of the Atlanta City Council in 1981 and earned election to Congress as a representative for Atlanta, remaining a member ever since.
Lewis is currently senior chief deputy whip for the Democratic Party in the House as well as a member of the House Ways and Means Committee. He holds more than 50 honorary degrees from universities like Princeton and Columbia.
He is also the recipient of numerous awards including the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for Lifetime Achievement, the only such distinction ever granted by the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation.
History professor Lisa M. McGirr, who teaches U.S. in the World 41: “Power and Protest: The United States in the World of the 1960s,” wrote in an emailed statement that she thinks Lewis is a “terrific” choice of speaker. She pointed to his actions in the civil rights movement and called him an “inspiration” for Harvard graduates.
“He is an excellent and timely choice at a moment when a new generation of young people are beginning to raise their voices to demand an end to gun violence and continued racial injustice,” McGirr wrote.
Lewis’s office did not respond immediately for comment Wednesday night.

In early January, the "bomb cyclone" hit Cambridge.
All Harvard University operations, including emergency health services, shut down almost immediately. The city gradually disappeared under more than seven inches  of snow. At one point, more than 24,000 Bostonians lost power.
Throughout it all, Y2Y and the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter kept their doors open. The two shelters—both founded and run by Harvard students—stayed open to serve the local homeless community. Y2Y and HSHS remained operational despite a significant dearth of volunteers, given most College students spend winter break away from campus.
The bomb cyclone eventually passed, and students returned to campus. But the storm highlighted the larger predicament the student-staffed shelters face in the winter season.
During the often-freezing Harvard winter, Y2Y and HSHS must navigate extreme weather conditions with a skeleton staff—watching the demand for overnight beds rise while the volunteer pool shrinks.
On many nights, Y2Y has a dozen callers for a single bed.
Y2Y operates via a random lottery system, which homeless youth enter online or by calling the shelter. Individuals lottery for 30-day beds or one-night cots, the latter of which typically have a win rate of 70 to 80 percent, even with high demand.
With only 22 beds and five cots, Y2Y’s capacity is small compared to the number of local homeless youth in need of beds, according to Y2Y director Sophie R. Applbaum '19.
“We’re full or at least one person away from being full pretty much every night,” Applbaum said.
As a result, the shelter must often turn people away, especially during colder weeks, she said. Since the one-night bed lottery runs for half an hour starting at 9 p.m., entrants must wait until almost 10 p.m. to hear whether or not they won a place to sleep that night. Those who are turned away can request referrals to adult shelters for the night, but, for some homeless youth, this forms an undesirable alternative.
“Adult shelters are not primarily set up to help young people and to make young people feel like they’re safe,” Applbaum said. “Many people will choose to sleep outside, pretty much no matter the condition, rather than sleeping at an adult shelter.”
Y2Y—which first opened in Dec. 2015—distinguishes itself by delivering services suited for youth needs, serving only those between the ages of 18 and 24. The shelter is also unique for its nontraditional offerings—Y2Y provides more than just beds at night.
One of only two youth-specific overnight shelters in the Boston area, Y2Y offers young adults legal services and case management, as well as appointments with doctors, dentists, and mental health clinicians. The space is also fully gender-inclusive, aiming to create a safe and accepting environment for queer homeless youth, who comprise 40 percent of homeless young adults, according to a 2012 study conducted by the Williams Institute.
The vast majority of Y2Y staff and volunteer base are college students within the same age range as the guests, which creates a “cooperative dynamic” between the two groups, according to Applbaum.
When the winter months turn icy, Y2Y and HSHS often turn to local volunteers in addition to Harvard students, staffers say.
With most Harvard students away for the bulk of December and January, far fewer people sign up to help with shelter meals and clean-up. Though always fully staffed with trained supervisors to comply with safety regulations, the two shelters must sometimes function with only a few additional volunteers to help out.
According to HSHS administrative director Ana K. Chaves ’17–’18, Harvard students constitute roughly 70 percent of the total volunteers. During term-time, the shifts are primarily worked by undergraduates, but in their absence, volunteers from the Cambridge area play an integral role in keeping the shelter up and running.
“Cambridge is surrounded by a lot of people that don’t disappear the moment the semester ends. We really do rely on much of the community members that live around here, whether those are young professionals or grad students,” said Corey A. Gold ’19, an administrative director for HSHS. “Different congregations come and do group shifts together.”
The Harvard Square Homeless Shelter operates at maximum capacity from the start of its operations in November until its season ends in mid-April. On most days, the shelter is open from 8 p.m. to 7 a.m., and the hours are broken down into four shifts, each staffed by four to six volunteers in addition to the two trained staffers.
As the weather consistently falls below the freezing point starting in early December, an increasing number of people call to enter HSHS’s daily lottery, used to allocate the limited number of beds. With the shelter regularly operating at maximum capacity over break, staffers say the absence of routine volunteers is felt even more acutely, with some shifts going understaffed.
Even with most of its regular volunteers gone, HSHS continues its operations as per usual, often relying on the assistance of new helpers. “It is always a comfort to have experienced volunteers. Just when things start to pick up, you can always rely on their own expertise, but first-time volunteers are usually enthusiastic, which is great,” Chaves said.
Despite difficulties ranging from freezing storms to absent student volunteers, Y2Y and HSHS continue to fill their beds and shelter the local homeless community. For much of the staff, it is not the logistical accomplishments but the emotional importance of the job that stays with them well after their shifts end.
“As the numbers rise and as more people call in to lottery, as our capacity remains the same, I think we come more closely into contact with the reality of the need that we are trying to serve,” Chaves said.
For some, turning away an increasing number of people serves as a sobering but essential reminder of the need both shelters are meant to address.
“It’s a different confrontation with the issue,” Gold said. “We’re going into our 35th year this season, and it was supposed to be a one year thing. It was supposed to be an emergency arrangement, but that need never went away.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Theater, Dance, and Media, in its fourth year as Harvard’s youngest concentration, is searching for new faculty members and diversifying its curriculum, in an effort to further integrate its three focus areas.
Since the concentration began in 2015, the number of TDM concentrators has doubled. Eight students declared TDM as their concentration in 2015, while 14 sophomores chose TDM this past fall, according to Sylvaine Guyot, interim chair of the TDM concentration and professor of Romance Languages and Literatures.
“It does not happen so often to be in this moment of growth and development in a program.  Even though we are not a department yet, it is very exciting and promising,” Guyot said.
The expanding TDM committee is in the process of conducting two searches for new faculty members, one in playwriting and the other as an artistic director. Guyot also hinted that a “fourth dimension” of TDM may be on the horizon.
“There is going to be a new position in the music department of somebody who will be teaching courses for TDM. It’s a position in composition,” she said.
As TDM has grown, so has the diversity in its curriculum. Guyot said the performing arts of today are much more of a “fluid continuum” than they used to be.
“One of our goals and a thing that we want to transmit to our students is the mutually constructive relationships between the form, vocabulary, history, and method of three areas of dance, theater, and media,” she said.
Guyot said that the TDM concentration is at the crossroads of many disciplines and offers a balance between practice, theory, and history. TDM faculty come from the American Repertory Theater, Harvard academic departments, and from the practice.
“It was really the idea since the beginning to develop this integrated model of a performing arts and to have this T shaped program. It is the T of TDM,” Guyot said. “Both the integration of all arts and at the same time depth and precision in each art.”
The flexibility of the TDM curriculum, Guyot said, allows students some choice in choosing between an integrated course of study and a more narrow area of specialization. However, Guyot added that students will not leave TDM without an appreciation of the integrated nature of the performing arts.
“Even though you want to become a specialist of just theater, you will be aware that you cannot conceive of theater independently from dance, media, and music,” Guyot said.
Looking ahead, TDM is continuing to move towards the “practical continuum between disciplines.” In designing classes for next year, the TDM faculty are looking to mostly add courses that showcase an interdisciplinary or integrative element.
“There has been a necessity for us as faculty and practitioners to collaborate among ourselves,” Guyot said. “We’re thinking of developing co-taught courses with one faculty in theater and one faculty in media, for instance.”
One such course that bridges theater and media will be co-taught by English professor David Levine and by VES professor Karthik Pandian, who are currently planning the details of the class.

Members of the Faculty Council heard a proposal from the Business School concerning a new Ph.D. program and voted to dissolve the Council on Asian Studies at their biweekly meeting Wednesday afternoon.
The body also approved a plan to change the name of the Neurobiology concentration.
The dissolution and the renaming  stem from proposals the Faculty Council—the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ highest governing body—heard at its previous Feb. 14 meeting. The first proposal advocated the dissolution of the Council on Asian Studies because the Asia Center already carries out most of the duties of the Council. The second sought to rename the Neurobiology concentration to “Neuroscience” in an effort to match the terms used by scientists in the field.
Faculty Council member David L. Howell said both proposals passed without facing any opposition from Council members. The changes will go into effect immediately given neither of the proposals need to go before the larger general Faculty.
The Council also heard from faculty at the Business School, including Dean Nitin Nohria. They presented a proposal to establish a Ph.D. in Business Administration in place of a degree they currently grant, termed "Doctor of Business Administration."
The proposal claims the D.B.A. degree is outdated and does not accurately reflect the work students do in order to achieve the degree.
Howell said he thought there was “pretty strong support” for the proposal from the other Council members.
“The folks of the Business School made a very strong case that the D.B.A. degree has changed so much over time that Harvard really stands out as an outlier,” Howell said. “It's kind of a slight disadvantage to students who get that degree and then go out to the job market because nowadays, when people hear D.B.A., they think of it as kind of an executive education degree rather than a research degree.”
The Council will likely vote on the new Ph.D. program at its next meeting on March 21. The entire Faculty will then hear that proposal at its April meeting.
The next full Faculty meeting is slated for Tuesday, March 6.

Harvard Student Agencies acquired Campus Insights, a student-run millennial user experience firm, earlier this month as part of an expansion into the technology industry.
Campus Insights, founded by brothers Riley Soward and Stephen Soward in 2014, is a tech consulting startup that conducts user research and analysis for their clients’ apps or websites.  
The company employs college students to interview similarly aged tech users, according to James N. Swingos ’20, who has worked with the Sowards since last July and has now taken over as CEO of Campus Insights.
Swingos said that using student interviewers in a casual setting is an advantage of the company's model.
“It’s more relatable, and as a result interviewees feel more comfortable,” he said. As both founders have graduated from Boston College and moved on, they looked to HSA to continue the mission of Campus Insights.
“They were like, how do we keep this going? Let’s put in an organization that systematically has college students run the show,” Swingos said.
Swingos said the acquisition aligned with HSA’s future plans.
“We wanted to keep moving into tech because we think it’s an awesome opportunity for managers to learn about more technical spaces, as opposed to more traditional HSA stuff,” Swingos said.
HSA began their expansion into the tech and startup area over a year ago with the inception of Dev, their new web and app development program.
“Campus Insights was a logical addition to that portfolio,” HSA President Ali Dastjerdi ’19 said. “We build software products for companies, and then we also have an arm that tests those software products for those companies.”
Dastjerdi said the acquisition process, ongoing for the past year, has been a learning experience.
“I suddenly found myself in the world of acquisitions,” he said. “The number of negotiations, the contracts, the details—all of that was a huge learning endeavor, but was incredibly exciting to take on.”
Swingos now works with a team of five others, comprising four researchers and another salesperson in addition to himself.
“In general, sales is pretty tough because we’re selling a very niche product, to a niche group of people,” Swingos said. In particular, he said, it is more difficult for college students to sell to higher profile companies.
“We just finished a project with Airbnb a month and a half ago, and we’re working with a Fortune 50 company right now,” Swingos said.

With ongoing uncertainty regarding the renewal of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Graduate School of Education hosted a panel focused on ways to support undocumented students in K-12 schools on Wednesday afternoon.
Speaking to a crowd of current and aspiring educators, panelists highlighted the important role schools play in the lives of undocumented students. The panel was part of a larger series called “DACA Seminar” being held at Harvard over the course of this semester.
Everyone on the panel had a stake in the debate on immigration reform, many having experienced growing up undocumented and all being outspoken advocates for the undocumented community. Panelists expressed concern over the lack of knowledge schools have when it comes to supporting undocumented students.
“Out of the undocumented people in my life, 95 percent of us found out we were undocumented in school,” said Jin K. Park ’18, one of the event’s speakers.
Park said he was fortunate enough to have a high school counsellor who helped him through the DACA process so that he could apply to colleges. For many undocumented students, though, schools are not as supportive or informed.
Astou Thiane, a middle school teacher and member of Teach for America, said many teachers “don’t know what their roles are” and are unaware of the laws put in place to protect undocumented students.
The uncertain fate of DACA affects many teachers and school staff as well as students. “There are thousands of DACAmented teachers in our public school systems today,” Roberto G. Gonzales, a GSE professor and moderator of the panel, said.
In addition to the importance of educators having the knowledge to assist undocumented students, the panel also emphasized the need to counter harmful immigration narratives in schools.
Luis Ortega, one of the panelists and founder of the activist organization Storytellers for Change, shared his experience about being an undocumented student.
“I was told that someone like me doesn’t go to college,” he said.
Other panelists shared similar stories about facing discouragement while in K-12 school. Viridiana Carrizales, the Managing Director of DACA Corps Member Support at Teach For America, cited a high dropout rate for undocumented students, beginning as early as late elementary school.
“Students are asking themselves ‘Why does it matter? Why should I try harder in school if there is nothing for me?,’” Carrizales said.
For Park, being on DACA also meant constant pressure to be high-achieving and thus “deserving of America.” Other panelists spoke similarly about the problem of tying value to achievement.
“As long as we are willing to say that some students are more worthy than others, we will always have a failing education system,” Ortega said.
This semester’s DACA Seminar program comes in the midst of a series of other recent events focused on immigration and DACA at the University, including a student conference, a number of protests, and other panel discussions.

UPDATED: March 2, 2018 at 12:33 a.m.
The number of students concentrating in Theater, Dance, and Media—Harvard's youngest concentration at four years old—has almost doubled over the past three years.
Now, staffers for the program are searching for new faculty members and are diversifying the concentration's curriculum in an effort to further integrate its three namesake focus areas.
Ten students declared TDM as their concentration in 2015, while 13 sophomores chose TDM this past fall, according to Sylvaine Guyot, interim chair of the concentration and professor of Romance Languages and Literatures.
“It does not happen so often to be in this moment of growth and development in a program. I think it is immensely exciting, promising, and timely,” Guyot said.
The expanding TDM committee is in the process of conducting two searches for new faculty members, one in playwriting and the other as an artistic director. Guyot also hinted that a “fourth dimension” of TDM may be on the horizon.
“There is going to be a new position in composition in the music department and that faculty member will be teaching courses suitable for cross-listing with TDM," she said. "The idea is to get someone who has worked in relation to the performing arts."
As TDM has grown, so has the diversity in its curriculum. Guyot said the performing arts of today are much more of a “continuum” than they used to be.
“One thing we would like to impart on our students is the mutually constructive relationships and inextricable connection between the form, vocabulary, history and method of dance, theater, and media,” she said.

When Lawrence S. Bacow becomes Harvard’s 29th president this summer, not only will he bring new ideas about how to run the University, he will quickly begin appointing administrators to help advance his initiatives and fill recently vacated positions.
Though University President Drew G. Faust said in an interview last month that she plans to complete the  various dean searches currently underway, it will fall to Bacow to choose a new Vice President for Alumni Affairs and Development, as well as any other roles that open up before or in the first few months of his term.
Faust said administrators often step down when a new president assumes their role. She said the length of presidential terms at Harvard usually serve as natural career breaks for people who work in any given administration.
"People who have served with me may feel that their chunk of time is the appropriate one,” Faust said. “I think it’s less about me than this is a time when it’s a moment to do something different and something new.”
Shortly after Faust was appointed in 2007, she took over searching for new deans for the Medical School, the Graduate School of Design, and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. She also quickly created the position of executive vice president and appointed Tamara Rogers to the then-vacant position of vice president for alumni affairs and development.
Though no other vice presidents besides Rogers have said they plan to step down at this time, more turnover could surface in the coming months.
Derek C. Bok, Harvard’s 25th president who served two decades in the role, said administrative turnover associated with a new president stems from two main things—the chemistry the incoming president has with the current staff members, and whether people from the former administration see the regime change as a chance to move onto something new. He said the turnover process, though, can take some time.
“Sometimes that will kind of take a year,” Bok said. “People will announce to a new president that they're going to leave in a year, and that gives a little bit of breathing room for the new president to choose a replacement.”
Though Bacow will be new to the presidency, he is already heavily involved with Harvard leadership. He serves as a member of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body. Bok said he is unsure if Bacow’s familiarity with the University will lead to less turnover than is typical in presidential transitions.
Judy S. Olson, who served as chief of staff when Bacow became the president of Tufts in 2001, wrote in an email to The Crimson that she did not know Bacow prior to his appointment to Tufts, but that she had a positive experience when he served  as her boss.
While Olson did not comment specifically on the staffing transition during Bacow’s tenure at Tufts, she listed many challenges associated with staffing a president’s office.
“The challenge in staffing a president’s office is assembling a team of people who work well together to the benefit of the university, who are great at what they do, are creative and versatile, and understand that they serve the entire university community and are there to help,” she wrote.

More than 50 people rallied in Harvard Yard on Wednesday afternoon to support workers with Temporary Protected Status.
The rally was organized by the Harvard TPS Coalition—a group of workers who form part of some of Harvard’s campus unions—and its allied labor and student groups. Organizers sought to send a message that union workers and immigrants impacted by the Trump administration’s decision to terminate TPS benefits are “Here to Stay,” a phrase used to show solidarity against Trump’s deportation pledges.
The Trump administration recently chose to end the Temporary Protected Status program for immigrants from Haiti and El Salvador, among many other countries, affecting thousands of immigrants across the nation and dozens of Harvard affiliates.
Several representatives of different unions—UNITE HERE Local 26, 32BJ SEIU, the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers, and the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers—attended the event. The rally featured speakers from these and other co-sponsoring student groups that focus on immigration, labor issues, and communities of color.
Speaking to the crowd in front of the John Harvard statue, Geoff Carens, a member of the HUCTW, addressed not only TPS workers, but also DACA recipients.
“Your struggle is our struggle,” Carens said. “We are with you today, we are with you tomorrow, and we are with you everyday. We have a racist administration, but we will not rest until we get justice.”
“This issue is an attack on labor and on immigrants and we’re not going to be silent about it,” Student Labor Action Movement member Anselm Kizza-Besigye ’21 said.
“We’re going to keep fighting to support TPS workers here at Harvard and everywhere around the country to make sure they are safe and able to stay in their communities,” he added.
Towards the end of the rally, Harvard campus police demanded to see the identification cards of people at the rally, something that had not occurred in previous pickets, according to Carens.
“I’m not exactly sure why and they didn’t give us a good reason either,” Carens said. “And during the rally [police] also wouldn’t allow people to film or take videos on their phones without a permit.”
In an emailed statement, Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote that “HUPD monitored a demonstration in Harvard Yard this afternoon."
"Representatives from Harvard Public Affairs and Communication asked the parties to stop filming as they did not have a film permit," he wrote. "HUPD officers spoke to one of the student organizers at the end of the demonstration.”
Christine Mitchell, a student at the School of Public Health and a teaching fellow at the College, said the government’s new policy decisions have led to many health repercussions for immigrant workers and their families.
“The TPS and DACA repeal has created fear from separation of families and fear of deportation,” Mitchell said. “We need to ensure safe, healthy, equitable, and permanent residence for all those under attack right now.”
The rally, which lasted for about 90 minutes, also brought together people from other campuses in the Boston area. Students from Tufts, UMass Boston, Lesley, MIT, and Northeastern demonstrated to show support for TPS workers.
Carla Morales, a student at UMass Boston and a member of the TPS Committee of Massachusetts, said she came to the rally to stand in solidarity with TPS employees at Harvard.
“I think this rally was a sign of democracy that helps our voices be heard for a cause that is important and for a cause that supports not just TPS workers but all immigrants who are discriminated,” Morales said.
A self-described TPS recipient herself, Morales said she hopes to continue advocating for her rights and the “rights of all immigrants to obtain permanent residency in the [United States].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students and alumni, in conjunction with a number of organizations across 11 other colleges, called for greater transparency in the use of “legacy preferences” in a Feb. 14 letter sent to university administrators across the country.
The EdMobilizer Coalition, an advocacy group for first-generation college students, published the letter, signed by 13 student and alumni organizations from hailing elite universities from all over the United States. The document, titled the "#FullDisclosure Letter," calls for more transparency in the legacy-specific admissions process.
“We are specifically asking our universities to make all internally written admissions policies and data about legacy treatment public and to charge a joint committee of students, alumni, and administrators to re-evaluate its use,” the letter reads.
In the letter, the EdMobilizer Coalition argued legacy preferences are discriminatory and perpetuate economic inequality. The letter’s authors claim greater transparency about admissions processes will lead to greater equality in college admissions.
One signatory Harvard-affiliated alumni group, called the Harvard Legacy Project, comprises University affiliates who hope to end the use of legacy preferences in college admissions. Leaders of the alumni group did not respond to requests for comment on the letter.
Evan J. Mandery ’89, a member of Harvard Legacy Project, did not specifically comment on the letter but said legacy preference as part of the admissions process at the College is in “fundamental contradiction” to the College’s efforts to create a more diverse student body.
“Legacy has no plausible ethical basis as a factor in any college admissions process,” Mandery said. “They’re effectively running two separate admissions contests.”
The Harvard-Radcliffe Asian-American Women’s Association is listed as a signatory of the document, but group co-president Julie S. Chung ’20 wrote in an emailed statement that she “signed the petition personally, but not in any way through the Asian American Women’s Association.”
In addition to the two Harvard-affiliated organizations, signatories include first-generation student groups at other colleges like Brown and Cornell as well as organizations focused on supporting low-income students at Duke, University of Chicago, Swarthmore, and Emory.
Last year, EdMobilizer authored a petition calling on universities to eliminate application fees for low-income and first-generation college applicants. Former Undergraduate Council president Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 and the Harvard College First Generation Student Union member Derek Ponce ’18 signed this previous letter.
In 2011, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67  told The Crimson the acceptance rate for students with legacy status had hovered around 30 percent in recent admissions cycles; students with legacy status composed 12 to 13 percent of the student body at the time. The admissions office did not directly respond to requests for comment about statistics for more recent years.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane confirmed the admissions office’s “definition of legacy” has not changed since the 2011 statistics were provided.
“Regarding legacy admissions at Harvard, please note that Harvard College's application process is the same for all candidates,” Dane wrote in an emailed statement. “Among a group of similarly distinguished applicants, the daughters and sons of Harvard College alumni/ae may receive an additional look.”
Fitzsimmons has previously defended the success of legacy students in the admissions process.
“If you look at the credentials of Harvard alumni and alumnae sons and daughters, they are better candidates on average,” Fitzsimmons said in 2011. “Very few who apply have no chance of getting in.”
While the College’s admissions policies on considering legacy status have remained the same, the admissions process has likely become more competitive overall. A record number of students applied for admission to the Class of 2022, and the Class of 2021 saw the lowest admission rate in the College’s history.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

UPDATED: March 1 at 5:05 p.m.
Students called on architects to keep the "finer details" of Adams House intact at a town hall held Wednesday night to gather input on planned renovations to the residential complex.
With construction set to commence in 2019, Adams will form the sixth installment of Harvard’s ongoing House renewal project. The more-than-$1 billion undertaking began in 2012 with renovations to the Old Quincy building and Leverett House’s McKinlock Hall, followed by total overhauls of Dunster House and Winthrop House. Lowell House is currently under construction.
At the start of the town hall, Adams Faculty Dean John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67 told attendees the exterior of Adams House will not be undergoing renovation.
“There are certain limitations that you probably should know about in the beginning, which are that the Historical Society for Cambridge will not allow us to change the outside,” Palfrey said. “So everything happens inside. But a lot can happen inside.”
Architects then gave a formal presentation, offering an overview of the likely timeline for construction. The presenters said renovations to Adams House will proceed in stages, with different residential halls of the House set to be restored at different times. Claverly Hall is slated to be renovated from June 2019 to July 2020, according to Elizabeth R. Leber, a partner at architectural firm Beyer Blinder Belle. Apthorp House and Randolph Hall will follow in the next summer, and Russell Hall and Westmorly Court the year after.
After the formal presentation, the architects invited students to answer a few questions by texting responses to a phone number. One question asked what spaces or architectural features in the House are “character-defining” or “particularly important to preserve.”
The most popular response comprised the Adams House tunnels, a network of mural-filled underground tunnels that connect the House's different entryways.
Other students responded that the House library and the Outing Club—located on the street level of Claverly—should be preserved, as well as the dark wood that decorates the House’s interior walls.
“This is what people expect of the Harvard experience,” attendee Cameron J. Maltman ’20 said. “If you come in here and take a wrecking ball to these finer details, you lose that.”
Maltman said that, when his family visited, they were very impressed by the old-fashioned characteristics of his room, especially the fireplace.
“It’s easy to imagine back to the old Adams House people, back in the '30s, who would be using that fireplace in the winter while they sat in their big armchairs and read Chaucer,” he said.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Assistant Dean for Physical Resources Merle Bicknell attended the town hall Thursday. She spoke about Harvard's other renovation projects, noting that Winthrop students were generally satisfied with improvements to the House.
Since Winthrop was the last House to be renovated, administrators surveyed Winthrop residents for feedback, hoping to use their recommendations for future House renewals.
“We haven’t had a single complaint about the housing, at all, which is fantastic,” Bicknell said. “The one thing they said to us is they want more party space, and so that’s something we’re conscious of.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences will vote to either accept or reject the appearance of the College’s policy on single-gender social organizations in the Harvard student handbook, Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair announced Thursday.
This acceptance or rejection will occur at the end of the semester as part of the Faculty’s annual review of changes to the handbook.
The Office of Student Life will oversee the implementation of Harvard’s social group policy and will request that the Faculty approve the policy and add it to the handbook, O’Dair wrote in an email Thursday detailing the College's final plan to implement its year-old social group policy.  The penalties—the subject of months of review and debate—prohibit members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from holding leadership positions in student organizations and athletic teams and from receiving endorsements for certain prestigious fellowships. The sanctions took effect with the Class of 2021.
Dean of FAS Michael D. Smith previously said in an interview that large changes to the handbook would have to go before the Faculty Council—FAS’s highest governing body—twice before being presented to the full Faculty for a vote. The Faculty typically vote on changes to the handbook at their May meeting.
The handbook vote will mark the first time the Faculty vote directly on the policy. Last semester, former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68  proposed a motion designed explicitly to cancel the sanctions. The text of the legislation, though, did not mention the penalties directly.
The motion instead stated that the College shall not “discipline, penalize, or otherwise sanction students” for joining “any lawful organization.” At the November Faculty meeting, 90 professors voted for the motion and 130 professors voted against it, striking it down.
In interviews last semester and last month, Smith, University President Drew G. Faust, and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana all repeatedly said they did not yet know whether the policy would be listed in the handbook.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The College canceled a proposed “bridge” program that would have allowed traditionally all-female final clubs and sororities a longer period of time to go gender-neutral in the final enforcement plan for its social group policy administrators released Thursday morning.
Harvard’s roughly year-old policy, which took effect with the Class of 2021, bars members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from campus leadership positions, the captaincies of varsity athletic teams, and from receiving College endorsement for certain fellowships.
The sanctions target both all-male and all-female groups. But under a proposal put forth in March 2017 by a committee tasked with reviewing the penalties, women’s groups would have been able to retain a “gender focus” while still complying with the College’s policy for three to five years.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana accepted that particular recommendation—along with many others—in March 2017. Now, though, the College has decided against the bridge program.
In lieu of that initiative, administrators are dedicating resources and personnel specifically to help women’s groups transition to co-ed status, according to the final plan released Thursday. The designated staff includes Heidi Wickersham, the program manager at the Harvard College Women’s Center, and unspecified employees in the Office of Student Life.
“[These administrators] will jointly partner with groups wishing to transition from having a women’s exclusive membership while maintaining a women’s-focused mission,” the plan reads. “We welcome all organizations, and especially those whose membership is currently restricted to women, to partner with us.”
The additional resources devoted to women’s groups are different from the suggested bridge program, according to Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane. Administrators ultimately chose not to accept that program—and the process to go gender-neutral will now be the same for both men’s and women’s groups, Dane said.
The final plan cited what it called Harvard’s “long and complex history of grappling with gender discrimination” in justifying the College’s decision to allocate staff specifically to women’s groups.
Khurana also pointed to historic inequalities faced by women at Harvard when he accepted the recommendation for the bridge program in March 2017. The dean wrote in a College-wide email at the time that he thought these disparities meant all-female groups might require additional resources to transition into “inclusive organizations.”
“I will consult with the Dean of Students and the Committee on Student Life on how to best support a vigorous and non-discriminatory social experience responsive to the realities that our students… are not all starting from the same place,” Khurana wrote in the email.
Shortly after its debut, the College’s social group policy drew protest from hundreds of Harvard women, who took to Harvard Yard to march in protest of what they described as unfair targeting of spaces for women.
Some all-female clubs have since chosen to openly defy the sanctions. The Harvard chapters of Alpha Phi, Delta Gamma, and Kappa Alpha Theta proceeded with standard all-female recruitment this spring, though the sororities drew roughly half as much interest as in previous years.
Other women-only groups, though, have taken the opposite tactic. Earlier this year, formerly all-female Kappa Kappa Gamma adopted gender-neutral membership practices and severed ties with its national organization to become the co-ed “Fleur-de-Lis” club. In its first-ever recruitment season, the Fleur garnered interest from 187 students and ultimately accepted 44.
Though the Fleur plans to accept men, it will remain a “female-focused group,” according to members.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Administrative Board will enforce the College’s penalties on members of single-gender social groups, the College announced Thursday as part of its long-anticipated final implementation plan for its controversial social life policy.
Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair emailed the plan, developed in large part by the Office of Student Life and hosted on a newly debuted Harvard website, to students Thursday morning. The guidelines—initially slated to be released at the start of the spring semester—detail exactly how the College will implement its sanctions.
Starting with the Class of 2021, the penalties—the subject of more than a year of campus debate and protest—bar members of unrecognized single-gender social groups from holding campus leadership positions or varsity athletic team captaincies and from receiving College endorsement for certain fellowships.
“This is primarily a social policy. Our expectation is that it will be adjudicated through the Administrative Board,” O’Dair said in an interview Wednesday. “If there are questions about what body this would go to, the Danoff Dean of Harvard College, currently Rakesh Khurana, would be the individual who would make that decision.”
“But our expectation is that the Administrative Board will,” she said.
Though the College has finalized its plan, the sanctions themselves are not yet fully finalized—per O’Dair’s email Thursday, the College will formally request that the sanctions be incorporated in the Harvard College Student Handbook. This means the Faculty of Arts and Sciences will need to formally vote to accept or reject the penalties as part of the handbook.
The choice to task the Ad Board with enforcing the sanctions goes against previous implementation recommendations Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana accepted in March 2017. The March proposals—authored by a committee charged with recommending how to implement the sanctions—suggested the Honor Council help enforce the policy.
The final implementation plan also reverses several other key recommendations in the March report, according to O’Dair and Assistant Dean of Student Life Alexander R. Miller. O’Dair and Miller said in an interview Wednesday that—contradicting previous proposals—the College will not require students to sign a pledge affirming their compliance with the policy; will not mandate that social groups publish demographic breakdowns of their memberships; and will not offer a transitional program for all-female social groups.
The March report recommended the College offer a three to five year “bridge” program during which all-female social organizations could retain their gender-focus without penalties. But the final plan cancels this suggestion.
The new plan also expands the number of campus leadership positions subject to the policy—positions which students in single-gender social groups will be unable to hold. In addition to all recognized student groups, the policy will also apply to College-affiliated and Phillips Brook House Association student programs.
But—as Khurana wrote in a March 2017 letter to students—the sanctions will not apply to leadership positions on The Crimson and the Undergraduate Council.
O’Dair and Miller detailed the reasoning behind the College’s decision to overturn some of the March recommendations in the interview Wednesday.
The March 2017 implementation report specifically suggested students seeking leadership positions, captaincies, and fellowships sign a written statement affirming their commitment to “nondiscrimination on the basis of characteristics of ‘intrinsic identity,’ including gender.” But O’Dair said the College ultimately decided a pledge was unnecessary.
“What we did not accept is any pledge or affirmation by students,” O’Dair said. “The change in this is that we… have accepted approaching this with trust, honesty, and transparency.”
Administrators also ultimately decided against the proposal that unrecognized single-gender social groups submit demographic breakdowns. The March report suggested some social organizations affected by the policy should regularly publish breakdowns of their membership, an initiative meant to hold the groups to “higher expectations” than “currently existing recognized groups.”
But Miller said Wednesday he thinks this suggestion is unnecessary.
“We don’t do that with recognized organizations, so we would not do that with these types of organizations,” Miller said.
The two administrators also discussed the College’s next steps regarding the social group penalties—both in the next few weeks and the next few months.
O’Dair and Miller said the Office of Student Life will not immediately publish a comprehensive list detailing which campus social groups are subject to the policy. The decision not to compile a list breaks with a promise Khurana made in a Dec. 2017 interview. At the time, Khurana said he would make sure that the list of affected organizations—first catalogued in the March report—is “up to date.”
Miller said he thinks it is still too early for the College to make and publish a definitive list.
“Once we’re in a place where we have some commitment from these organizations, groups who are interested in this provisional status, we will partner with them to release that information,” Miller said. “Because, for them, they’re also learning what does this mean to go gender-inclusive? So, it’s a little premature to share those names at this point for us.”
Over the past three years, at least seven of Harvard’s formerly single-gender social groups chose to go co-ed, raising the question of whether they are still subject to the College’s penalties. Some of these organizations have worked with administrators as they transitioned to gender-neutral membership practices.
In one example, members of the Fleur-de-Lis—formerly Harvard’s chapter of Kappa Kappa Gamma—said the group partnered with the College in its efforts to go co-ed.
Miller said organizations currently working with representatives at the Office of Student Life will be “fine”—meaning not subject to the penalties.
“For the groups that are working with us, we’ve made clear to them that now, you are fine as long as you’re talking with us and you’re working with us,” Miller said.
He said the groups choosing to cooperate with the Office have demonstrated they want to work “to the end of gender-inclusivity.”
Regarding long-term implementation, O’Dair said the College will not enforce the sanctions by actively searching for students who violate the policy. She also said Harvard will not solicit or act on “anonymous complaints” to discover violators.
She said any kind of anonymous system is “not what we are, in our community.”
“We trust our students, and we’re going to inform our students, we inform our students of all policies,” O’Dair said. “We are not going to undertake any efforts to go find students. We’ve been really clear about that.”
O’Dair and Miller did not specify further how the College plans to determine whether or not students are in violation of the sanctions.
The website-hosted guidelines administrators debuted Thursday also specify the Office of Student Life will work with the Athletics Department to ensure the penalties are enforced across varsity athletic teams. The Office will “partner” with the department to make certain that—when student-athletes vote to choose team captains—they “are aware of the current policy.”
Finally, the plan released Thursday announces the Office of Student Life plans to create a “new framework for governing primarily social organizations.” O’Dair wrote in an email to students she hopes this framework will be released in “the coming months” and be implemented next fall.
The social groups eligible for this new system will not include currently recognized student organizations, according to O’Dair’s email. Miller said Wednesday that eligible groups will comprise organizations that are “on this road of being part of the larger college organization landscape.”
He said he and other administrators are still working with students “to really figure out what that means.”
Asked why the College wants to create a new governance system for a new category of social group, Miller said the Office of Student Life has “a lot of different things to consider.”
“These are things that I would like to think about with these groups that I currently don’t think about with the math club,” Miller said. “There is a lot of liability when you throw a bunch of college students in a room to socialize.”
“So, at the core there, it requires me to think differently,” he said.
In the coming spring and fall semesters, O’Dair said the Office of Student Life will continue to work with social groups to bring them into compliance with the College’s policy.
“This next step that we are doing in the policy development is to figure out what are those criteria by which groups will be adherent to the policy, whether or not that leads to an official recognition, whether or not that leads to some annual adherence to the policy,” O’Dair said. “I just want to be really clear that we haven’t figured that out yet, but that is our next step in the process.”

Dear Veritawkward,There’s a guy in one of my clubs who I’ve started paying more attention to, and as a result I’m developing feelings for him. The only thing (besides my overwhelming cowardice in saying something to him) is that he’s a year younger. Is this something I should pursue or should I go for a guy my own age?Sincerely,Robbing the Cradle?
Dear Robbing the Cradle,Oh, honey. It’s honestly so cute that your main concern is a one-year age difference. No judgement at all, I actually find it quite adorable. As someone who has been involved with people several years younger than me, I say go for it. As long as he’s legal, of course. Sometimes younger significant others can give you that self-confidence boost you need, because obviously being older = being cooler/better/more interesting (just kidding). But seriously, one year of age difference shouldn’t come between your feelings for someone.
As for your self-proclaimed cowardice, knock that attitude off! I know it can be scary approaching someone and confessing your feelings, but I’ve always found that you regret the things you don’t do more than the things you do. Ask him to get a meal or go out for coffee after your club meets. You guys already see each other quite frequently, so it’s an easy transition to go from hanging out at club meetings to doing something one-on-one afterwards.You got this,Veritawkward
Dear Veritawkward,So I’m in a bit of a sticky situation. I used to casually hook up with this one guy, but it didn’t end up going anywhere. A couple weeks ago I matched with his blockmate on Bumble and we’ve hung out a couple times. I really like this new guy and want to start getting more serious, but I’m nervous about messing with their friendship. What should I do?Sincerely,Blocked by a Blockmate
Dear Blocked by a Blockmate,First of all, it’s refreshing to hear that someone at Harvard has had several hookup options, since most of us can barely find one person interested in a relationship of any kind. Congrats! However, it’s clear that the universe hasn’t totally aligned. It definitely sucks that these boys happen to be blockmates, but that’s no reason to completely drop your new bae. It’s a slight roadblock, but definitely maneuverable.
I would start by being very open with Boy #2 about your history with his blockmate, and feel out his response. If he’s chill with it, awesome! Then you can move on to step two. If not, that will be a hard pill to swallow, but you’re going to have to respect his feelings and wave the white flag. From my experience, friendship should always trump a relationship, and you definitely don’t want to ruin things between the boys.
Okay, step two: Telling Boy #1. If you guys are on good terms this should be fairly easy, and if not, just have Boy #2 talk to him. Since you said you two were never serious I doubt he’ll take it badly, but in the off-chance he does, I still stand by my advice to back off. You don’t want to get in the middle of their friendship, believe me. It’ll just end badly and lead to unfair resentments. However, I’m optimistic that it’ll all work out in your favor. Communication is the key to all good relationships, and definitely your best tool for working through this situation.Good luck out there,Veritawkward
