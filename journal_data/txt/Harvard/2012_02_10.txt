After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The civil demonstrations rocking the Arab world are unequivocally kind to America’s interests in at least one regard—we can continue to pretend that Iraq stopped existing when we stopped caring. Even after a $1 trillion investment, Iraq simply cannot compete with the latest slate of domestic and international politics, especially among a populace weary of an iota of Iraq-related news. Unfortunately, while Americans wear self-imposed blinders, Iraq relapses, and this time, America’s reduced leverage leaves her futilely crossing her fingers.
Human Rights Watch recently referred to Iraq as a “budding police state,” though the “budding” in that phrase seems more like “flourishing” by the day. Iraqi Prime Minister, Nuri al-Maliki, is driving Sunni politicians out of town—literally, in the case of his former vice president, Tariq Hashimi, who fled to Kurdish-controlled Erbil. This crisis was not an anomaly, but merely the most visible manifestation of an escalating trend. Maliki’s subsequent dismissal of the Sunni deputy prime minister, Saleh Mutlaq, was not only a dangerous usurpation of legislative and judicial authority, but also indicates Maliki’s growing fecklessness and aggression.
Like the Kurds before them, the Sunnis want out. Last week’s conclusion of the Sunni boycott on the parliament does not reflect the larger reality. The provincial councils of three Sunni provinces have called for autonomous federal regions similar to the jurisdiction of Iraqi Kurdistan. Maliki will prevent these pseudo-secessions at all costs. He justifiably fears both Sunni autonomy and competition from Moqtada al-Sadr for preeminence among Shi’a. According to Maliki’s political analysis, the gamble of playing the sectarian game is less risky than trying to compromise with Sunnis and Kurds.
The rapidly declining state of affairs was not inevitable. The proximate cause was the swift reduction of American military forces, especially those involved in training new troops. The fourteen to eighteen thousand troops recommended by former Commander of American Forces in Iraq, General Lloyd Austin, would have been a physical and symbolic barrier to the rising sectarian violence. Whether that steep reduction in troops ought to be considered the ultimate cause of Iraq’s crisis is arguable. Regardless, we must recognize that the rapid reduction of troops drastically destabilized an already fragile country and greatly reduced American influence and leverage.
The unwillingness of Iraq to sign another Status of Forces Agreement this year ostensibly doomed any possibility of American troops remaining on the ground. SOFA is an agreement that stipulates what laws govern the American forces in a foreign country, particularly whether American soldiers are under the jurisprudence of American or local laws. Pundits can only speculate as to how hard the Obama administration fought not to meet one of its campaign promises. The American rush out the door represents yet another moment in this long war when American leaders saw what they want to see instead of the reality of the situation. Obama’s Fort Bragg speech, in which he referred to Iraq as “sovereign, stable and self-reliant,” merits as much notoriety as Bush’s 2003 “Mission Accomplished” banner.
Efforts to exert leverage in other spheres have proven unsuccessful. One New York Times editorial suggested that an $11 billion arms deal in December between America and Iraq should have included “firm guarantees that Mr. Maliki would do a lot more to share power and resources.” Chances are that the deal included at least firm promises. But even if commitments were made on paper, why would they be fulfilled? The message that America has continually sent to the region from the Egyptian Delta to the palaces of Lahore is that deep coffers do not imply deep strength of will. Go ahead, place tens of thousands of protestors in prison without civil trials, cut off our supply routes to Afghanistan, and undermine our allies. America will still provide financial and military aid with a string of ready-made excuses.
The Pentagon argues that foreign military aid bolsters American diplomatic leverage. And it does. Until it becomes a yearly gift instead of a yearly deal. At that point, American officials inevitably say that without aid, X country would commit more human rights abuses, Y country would befriend Iran, China, or whomever, and Z country would further undermine our interests. Often, those excuses are right in the short-term. However, in the long run, this malleability reduces America to a dupe of our enemies and the world’s fool.
Members of Congress and President Obama deserve praise for initially freezing our share of Pakistan’s military aid at 60 percent. The subsequent stipulation that unfroze our share of Pakistani aid is less laudable. Congress only requires assurances from the US defense secretary, Leon Panetta that Pakistan is “working to counter improvised explosive devices.” For Pakistan’s military, Pakistan’s stability is a Gordian Knot, so the pretension of countering IEDs ought to be low-hanging fruit in comparison. Likewise, America’s threat to cut off military aid to Egypt on the basis of travel bans placed on Americans in Egypt is all bark and no bite. America’s relationships with Pakistan and Egypt, as with Iraq, demonstrate that America is an ally you can count on…even when you no longer consider her an ally.
For revealing the weaknesses of American foreign policy, the imminent chaos in Iraq ought to be a major story of the year for 2012. It won’t be. But it ought to be.

If you were anywhere near Harvard Business School last Saturday you might have seen a 12-foot tall puppet dancing to accordion music while a merry band of “Congresspeople” and “health insurance executives” swilled champagne, showered each other in cash and sang round after round of “For She’s A Jolly Good Fellow.” If you weren’t near HBS, you missed a fantastic party. Here’s what happened:
Karen Ignagni, CEO of America's Health Insurance Plans, was greeted by this band of Occupy Harvard and Occupy Boston at the 9th Annual Healthcare Conference at HBS, where she was the keynote speaker. The merry band feted the insurance industry's lobbyist-in-chief with an impromptu gala, honoring Ms. Ignagni with an award for "Excellence in the Business of Denying People Medical Care." The revelers welcomed conference goers with cheers of "A-HIP-Hooray" and explained why Ms. Ignagni had been chosen for this ignominious award. 
The award read: “Be it hereby known that Karen Ignagni has successfully upheld the interests of private insurance in the face of efforts to reduce the costs of administrative waste and to insure all Americans, preserving company rights to profit before the public’s right to health.”
Nearby, a comatose patient lay under a sign declaring "45,000 deaths per year due to lack of insurance", citing a well-publicized study by Harvard Medical School.
The 12-foot tall puppet was allowed to pay to register for the conference but barred from entering any of the conference buildings; poignantly illustrating that corporate medicine will gladly take the money of those not invited to the table. Unperturbed, the outdoor gala-goers still had plenty to say. "We want to thank AHIP and the insurance industry for making us all filthy rich," said one protester dressed as Max Baucus, the senior US senator from Montana.
More seriously, another protestor noted that, “the target here is not just the insurance industry, but the wholesale corruption of our government by corporate interests.” He told conference-goers, "when the health care industry spends half a billion dollars each year lobbying Congress, it's difficult to achieve meaningful health reform that prioritizes the health of the public."
It’s fitting that Ignagni was the keynote speaker at a conference titled “The Future of Healthcare: Innovative Business Models.” The current business model in healthcare legislation goes something like this: Large corporations spend hundreds of millions of dollars on lobbyists and contribute millions more directly to politicians on both sides of the aisle. Politicians then allow private health insurers to profit tremendously from a system that provides neither adequate coverage nor adequate care and has failed utterly to contain costs.
AHIP's success in this model is exemplary. Health insurance and drug companies donated $26.2 million to the 111th Congress. Politicians receiving the largest campaign contributions from health insurers were Barack Obama, John McCain, John Kerry, Max Baucus, Eric Cantor and John Boehner. After a vigorous ($86 million) campaign against health reform, health insurers not only defeated the public option but also got a bill that will compel all Americans to purchase private insurance. Critics may call AHIP two-faced, but we believe that its goals are clear: promoting the profitability of the health insurance industry.
Since Obamacare (the Affordable Care Act) passed into law, health insurers have seen record profits, raising premiums well above inflation. Last year the profits from the five largest insurers, UnitedHealth, WellPoint, Aetna, Humana and Cigna totaled $12.6 billion. That’s enough money to increase the number of low-income children receiving healthcare by 6.45 million. As working families and employers struggle to pay rising premiums, insurance CEOs rake in salaries of $10-20 million a year, which is 300 to 600 times greater than the median personal income in the U.S.
Obamacare will expand coverage to many of the over 40 million Americans without health insurance. Still, health insurance often fails to provide adequate coverage. Twenty-five million Americans are underinsured. In 2007, medical bills contributed to 62% of all personal bankruptcies. And 69% of those experiencing medical bankruptcy actually had health insurance at the time they got sick or injured—just not enough. 
For health care, the US pays more and gets less on key outcomes, such as health status (life expectancy) and financial risk protection (not being bankrupted by out-of-pocket medical expenses). The U.S. spends $7,500 per person on healthcare each year, twice as much as other rich nations spend, including Japan ($2,700), Spain ($2,900), Sweden ($3,500) and France ($3,700). And yet U.S. life expectancy is 78.2 years, while Japan’s is 83.0, Spain’s is 81.8, Sweden’s is 81.4 and France’s is 81.0.
Happily, there are plans that could truly reform our health system. One promising fix for our health system is to consolidate to single-payer insurance, a system in which a single public or quasi-public agency organizes health financing, but delivery of care remains largely private. With one payer, the US could save enough on administrative costs (more than $350 billion annually) to cover all of the uninsured.  Patients would regain free choice of doctor and hospital, and doctors would regain autonomy over patient care.
Of course, there’s nothing that private health insurers and their lobbyists will fight harder against. After all, although a single-payer healthcare system would save American lives, it would hurt the profitability of the health insurance industry.  The industry will continue to fight so that the champagne will keep flowing, the money will keep showering down, and the accordion will keep playing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Monday, Peter A. Thiel visited Harvard’s Institute of Politics. Thiel, the former chief executive officer of PayPal and a well-known venture capitalist and entrepreneur, spoke on a number of topics to interested students and other members of the audience. Among others, he promoted his internationally renowned Thiel Fellowship, a scholarship that grants twenty students $100,000 to leave higher education and pursue individual start-up innovation projects for two years. Indeed, last year, two Harvard students left to pursue projects with the prestigious grant, awarded to the “20 under 20” bright young people selected through a rigorous application process.
While the decision to leave college is a personal one, people like Thiel should not encourage students to forsake higher education for the sake of a shot at entrepreneurship mid-way through their undergraduate careers.
Of course, Harvard boasts multiple successful and well-known dropouts. For example, Mark Zuckerberg recently made national headlines when his company Facebook filed for an initial public offering, announcing its intention to go public in the near future. However, Facebook is the exception, not the rule, among start-up companies. Harvard students with dreams of starting tech companies that will be “the next Facebook” should understand that their chances of making it big are negligibly small.
The decision to leave Harvard temporarily or for good is, above all, a personal decision. Indeed, there are many reasons why a student might want to take time off from Harvard, including those stemming from mental health and financial issues. These are important and worthwhile justifications for taking time off—in fact, students should be encouraged to spend a semester or two away from campus if they need to alleviate stress. However, leaving school for personal reasons is different from leaving school to pursue an alternate career, like a start-up company.
Happily, Harvard allows students to take an indefinite amount of time off and still return to complete their undergraduate degree. This is essential. It is important that students are still able to return once they have taken time off to pursue a start-up. Nonetheless, Harvard students should recognize the risks of a decision to take time off and make the choice to leave only after serious consideration.
After all, college is a truly exceptional and important life experience, and a good investment of four years of one’s time. Peter Thiel, however, repeatedly denigrates the value of college. He has spoken out against the “higher education bubble,” suggesting that students go into debt and waste years of their lives in college simply “because that’s what everybody’s doing.” He has noted in interviews that “70 to 80 percent of the colleges in the U.S. are not generating a positive return on investment.” As students in the midst of the higher education experience, we believe that a liberal arts institution like Harvard is hardly a waste of time—on the contrary, students who have the ability and enthusiasm to attend college should not be discouraged from doing so by prominent public figures.
Meanwhile, we should question Thiel’s own motivations in speaking out against college. As an entrepreneur and venture capitalist with a vested interest in recruiting top talent, his advocacy against higher education and his establishment of the Thiel Fellowship are clearly both motivated in part by self-interest; indeed, they allow him both to mentor multiple intelligent and motivated young people and attract more attention to his controversial libertarian activism.
With this in mind, Thiel should not encourage students to drop out in the pursuit of marketable startup ideas, and students should think very hard before leaving to follow him.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Imagine for a moment a horrific scenario: eight men are walking door-to-door in a small town, knocking down doors and shooting anyone they find. By the end of this violent rampage, they have murdered a total of twenty-four people at close range for no reason. They are arrested and subsequently found guilty in court of massacring civilians in cold blood. In a twist of fate, however, the same court decides that these men should be acquitted, giving no reason, and rules that there will be no possibility of appeal.
This nightmarish scenario became a reality for dozens of families a few weeks ago after a Southern California military court allowed a marine convicted of massacring 24 unarmed Iraqi civilians in their homes to go free with only a minor pay dock and demotion. The seven other marines involved in the 2005 massacre in the Iraqi town of Haditha, meanwhile, had previously been acquitted or had the charges dropped, despite the overwhelming evidence of their participation in the killings.
Sergeant Frank D. Wuterich, the marine who led the bloodbath, ordered his troops to shoot first and ask questions later, and because of this many were holding out hope that despite letting seven of the killers off the hook, justice would be served. This faith in the American justice system was severely misguided.
The case’s verdict confirms something that has become frighteningly clear over the last decade: American troops will not be held responsible for the crimes they commit abroad. Americans have long conceived of their fighting forces as a noble lot who uphold values of integrity and justice in their conduct. While this does generally hold true, the unwillingness of the military to meaningfully punish those who engage in atrocities against citizens of other nations means that the United States military is complicit in the crimes against humanity being committed in our name.
It is important to note that the Haditha Massacre did not occur in isolation, but has followed years of atrocities committed at various levels of the United States Armed Forces with a shocking degree of official complicity. In 2006, U.S. forces killed ten members of a single family in their home in Al-Balad without punishment. Additionally, the torture of thousands of detained Iraqi civilians at Abu Ghraib has been well documented, with few consequences for the perpetrators.
In Afghanistan, meanwhile, U.S. soldiers and unpiloted drones have killed thousands of civilians over the last few years, including nearly a hundred people at Granai alone and another forty seven civilians at a wedding party in Deh Bala. As of yet, no one has been punished for any of these massacres.
The dehumanization of Afghan and Iraqi civilians that these massacres entail—one soldier who raped and killed a 14-year-old Iraqi girl and killed her and her family said “I didn’t think of Iraqis as human”—is, in fact, consistent with the wars themselves and the way in which the American public has come to see the Middle East. While the U.S. government speaks at length about the humanitarian impulses behind the wars—“saving” Iraqis and Afghans—the fact that the military thinks little of killing civilians en masse reflects the hollowness of this rhetoric.
The war crimes committed by U.S. troops have been met with little outcry domestically—jingoistic calls to “support our troops,” have not been qualified with “…unless they commit war crimes.”
Soldiers who have blown the whistle on atrocities committed by others in uniform, meanwhile, have been subjected to the full force of the government’s wrath. Since 2008, six soldiers have been charged with espionage for revealing information to journalists about atrocities committed by U.S. soldiers. When Private Bradley E. Manning sent Wikileaks a video of U.S. soldiers gunning down civilians in Iraq, he was arrested, and he has been detained in inhumane conditions in solitary confinement since. As Mazahir M. Hussain noted, “Bradley Manning should've really considered committing some war crimes instead of exposing them, [it] worked well for Frank Wuterich.”
The horrifying perversion of justice that Wuterich’s trial represents is, unfortunately, not as surprising as it should be. As long as the United States is not held accountable for its warmongering and aggression abroad, it makes little sense for the military to punish individuals who commit war crimes within its ranks. Our inability as a society to put the wars themselves on trial means that there is little chance of justice for their innocent victims in the foreseeable future.

When Slovenian philosopher and cultural critic Slavoj Žižek visited Harvard for a lecture on the ontology of sexual difference last October, FM staff writer Tara Raghuveer ’14 and contributing writer Bradley G. Bolman ’15 sat down to discuss the Occupy movement, pop culture, and modern academia.
Fifteen Minutes: What is the role of academia at an institution like Harvard in the current global crisis?
 
Slavoj Žižek: What is crucial and also I think—especially today, when we have some kind of re-emergence of at least some kind of practical spirit, protest, and so on—one of the dangers I see amongst some radical academia circles is this mistrust in theory, you know, saying, “Who needs fat books on Hegel and logic? My god, they have to act!”
No, I think quite on the contrary. More than ever, today it’s crucial to emphasize that on the one hand, yes, every empirical example undermines theory. There are no full examples. But, point two, this does not mean that we should turn the examples against theory. At the same time, there is no exception. There are no examples outside theories. Every example of a theory is an indication of the inner split dynamics of the theory itself, and here dialectics begins, and so on....
Don’t fall into the trap of feeling guilty, especially if you have the luck of studying in such a rich place. All this bullshit like, “Somalian children are starving....” No! Somalian children are not starving because you have a good time here. There are others who are much more guilty. Rather, use the opportunity. Society will need more and more intellectual work. It’s this topic of intellectuals being privileged—this is typical petty-bourgeois manipulation to make you feel guilty. You know who told me the best story? The British Marxist, Terry Eagleton. He told me that 20 or 30 years ago he saw a big British Marxist figure, Eric Hobsbawm, the historian, giving a talk to ordinary workers in a factory. Hobsbawm wanted to appear popular, not elitist, so he started by saying to the workers, “Listen, I’m not here to teach you. I am here to exchange experiences. I will probably learn more from you than you will from me.” Then he got the answer of a lifetime. One ordinary worker interrupted him and said, “Fuck off! You are privileged to study, to know. You are here to teach us! Yes, we should learn from you! Don’t give us this bullshit, ‘We all know the same.’ You are elite in the sense that you were privileged to learn and to know a lot. So of course we should learn from you. Don’t play this false egalitarianism.”
Again, I think there is a certain strategy today even more, and I speak so bitterly about it because in Europe they are approaching it. I think Europe is approaching some kind of intellectual suicide in the sense that higher education is becoming more and more streamlined. They are talking the same way communists were talking 40 years ago when they wanted to crush intellectual life. They claimed that intellectuals are too abstract in their ivory towers; they are not dealing with real problems; we need education so that it will help real people—real societies’ problems. And then, again, in a debate I had in France, some high politician made it clear what he thinks and he said...in that time in France there were those demonstrations in Paris, the car burnings. He said, “Look, cars are burning in the suburbs of Paris: We don’t need your abstract Marxist theories. We need psychologists to tell us how to control the mob. We need urban planners to tell us how to organize the suburbs to make demonstrations difficult.”
But this is a job for experts, and the whole point of being intellectual today is to be more than an expert. Experts are doing what? They are solving problems formulated by others. You know, if a politician comes to you, “Fuck it! Cars are burning! Tell me what’s the psychological mechanism, how do we dominate it?” No, an intellectual asks a totally different question: “What are the roots? Is the system guilty?” An intellectual, before answering a question, changes the question. He starts with, “But is this the right way to formulate the question?”
FM: You spoke at Occupy Wall Street a few months ago. What is your personal involvement with the Occupy Wall Street movement, and what do you think the protests signify?
SZ: None. My personal involvement was some guy who was connected with it, and he told me, “Would you go there, come there?” And I said, “Okay. Why not?” Then the same guy told me,“Be careful, because microphones are prohibited, you know, it’s this echoing, repeating.” So my friend told me, frankly, to be demagogic: “Just try to be as much as possible effective, short, slow,” and so on, and that was it. I didn’t even drop my work.
What does [Occupy] mean? Then they tell you, “Oh, Wall Street should work for the Main Street, not the opposite,” but the problem is not this. The problem is that the system stated that there is no Main Street without Wall Street. That is to say that banking and credits are absolutely crucial for the system to function today. That is why I understand Obama when—two years ago you know when the first, I think it was, $750 billion and a bit more—it was simply blackmail and it was not possible to say no because that’s how the system functions. If Wall Street were to break down, everything would break. We should think more radically. So again, the formula “Give money to Main Street and not to Wall Street” is ruined. That is to say, all these honest, hardworking people who do their jobs cannot find work now. Think how to change that. Think how to change [the] mechanisms of that. We are no longer dealing with short-term crises like in 2008.
FM: Why do you believe that the Right and the Left in America have failed to provide answers to the problems of inequality and the crises they predict?
SZ: It’s crazy but I’m convinced about it: look at the last two seasons of “24.” Look closely, something very interesting happens. It’s not only superficial, political correctness. In season seven, Jack Bauer investigates some Muslim attacks and then he discovers it’s not Muslims at all: it’s some American mega-security company who is manipulating these attacks. Something much more tragic happened in the last season, which I quite liked. It’s that, at the end, Jack Bauer breaks out of this authoritarian logic. Somebody has to do the dirty job, torturing, and so on. He says, “Maybe I should say it publicly, everything, I cannot live with it.” So this logic of “The true heroes are those who are ready to do the dirty job—torture for the country,”  it breaks down. His liberal counterpoint, the president, Allison Taylor, also breaks down and has to quit. So that, at the end, you get a very honest assessment of a deadlock and the message is: within the present global systemic coordinates, whatever you do, you end up in a deadlock. I think this honest confrontation with the ethical deadlock is much more valuable than the Hollywood Left “feel-good” attitude of movies like Pelican Brief or All the President’s Men, which may appear radical in their accusation: “Oh my god, even the President of the United States can be corrupted blah blah blah.” Nonetheless, these are all “feel-good” movies because at the end the final message is: “Wow, what a great country! Two ordinary guys can overthrow the mightiest man in the world!” If I were to choose between this Leftist, liberal All the President’s Men or Jack Bauer, I [would] choose Jack Bauer every day. I’m sorry to tell you. Because it does what honest conservatives want—not reactionaries: reactionaries are stupid, they think if we go back to lost values, it will work. Liberals are stupid progressives. What we can learn from honest conservatives is that they are ready to accept a deadlock.
For example, Marx said about Balzac: precisely as a conservative, Balzac depicted the deadlock of French society. Even [American political scientist] Francis Fukuyama, he no longer believes in this bullshit “end of history.” He told me that the very fact of the possibility of biogenetic manipulations makes his thesis on the “end of history” obsolete. And he thinks that to cope with this problem we need much stronger forms of social control, which liberal-democratic capitalism cannot provide. This is what I like and this is what we can learn from honest conservatives: they don’t bullshit you. And maybe this is the duty of us intellectuals. You know when people ask me on Wall Street, “What should we do?” I was so embarrassed because, fuck you, what do I know? I don’t. But what we should do is simply break the rules in the sense of opening new space. [The world is] confused as it is, always, from Wall Street to Egypt. Nonetheless, it is opening up space. People are becoming aware. It’s the first move, but nonetheless, we have to start to think about some kind of radical change. All these Leftist, liberal things—more gay rights, more abortion—of course we fight for that, but that’s not enough. Ironically, when I was young, we were dreaming about socialism with a human face; these guys are offering us global capitalism with a human face. It’s the same system but a little bit more.... We have to break this taboo, which was very strong until now: nobody even dared to imagine an alternative. Everyone was, in a way as I say, a Fukuyamist. Even radicals, we somehow accept that global capitalism and liberal democracy are here to stay, and the point is only to make the system a little bit more efficient. No, it is clear we have to start thinking.
And this is a great responsibility, because of course there is no way back to the glories of 20th century communism. No, but that’s our duty at this point, just to open up the field and, at the same time, to undermine, break. We have to be very destructive at this point, destructive in the sense of breaking false illusions....
Who would have expected the Arab Spring, or whatever you call it? It did happen. Who would have expected these big demonstrations in Europe that are occurring? They are happening. People at the beginning thought, “Oh this is something that will explode.” No, it goes on. There is a tremendous potential in dissatisfaction. But again, this is always a potential danger.
FM: It seems that a similar deadlock appears in the context of both the economic crisis and global warming—experts can’t seem to predict them, nor will politicians or society act to stop them.
SZ: I especially hate, from my own experience, when people say, “Oh, who could have predicted this [economic crisis]?” No. I know a couple of leftists and empiricists who exactly predicted this. These are not the kinds of cheap catastrophists who all of the time give bad predictions and then something happens so that they go awry. No, no. They were very precise and predicted this crisis. Paul Krugman said something deeply true. A guy asked him, “But now that we know, wouldn’t things be radically different if we were to know 10 years back what we know now?” He said, “No, no, it wouldn’t. The system pushes you to act in a certain way.” The illusion is much stronger. Like, you may know that there may be a catastrophe, but nonetheless, we would have done exactly the same thing. I mean, it’s no longer a question of knowledge. Today many, even sociologists, have this wonderful idea of how, although we live in a society of knowledge—even scientific knowledge—[it] is becoming more and more contingent, non-binding. I think it was the German theorist Ulrich Beck who drew attention to the simple fact: today we speak about expert opinions. Are we aware how paradoxical this term is? The idea is that we ordinary people have opinions. They tell you the truth. Now experts all of a sudden are telling us different opinions and we have to decide how, who knows, if even they don’t know. This is the tragedy of our predicament of freedom of choice. The problem is...we are often forced to choose without having serious cognitive coordinates of how or what to choose.... The price is that science is no longer a homogenous science but it’s turning into kind of a pluralistic field of opinions.
For example, I once had a debate with a quantum physicist. And he accused me, “You stupid guys with your French theory, total bullshit.” He made fun precisely of this: “You can just say whatever you want.” And I told him, “Fuck you! Look at quantum physics: literally anything goes. You can claim that there is a Big Bang, that there is no Big Bang, there were multiple Big Bangs…” It’s incredible how, when science approaches a certain limit, how open it becomes. It’s as if anything you can imagine, you find scientists who advocate. I’m not saying science is just laughable. It is real. I’m just saying how difficult it is to decide today without a proper cognitive base. We are more and more compelled to this.
Andre Depui said that the problem when people say, “Oh but we don’t know if it’s really global warming.” The problem is that if you want to wait until we really know, it will be, by definition, too late. Because we will really know when the catastrophe is here. This is maybe one of the great things that has to be decided as a specific problem—in Germany there were working with certain proponents of risk society—how to decide some basic rules of decision-making in situations that are cognitively non-transparent. You have to decide because not doing anything is also a decision. You have to decide, but you don’t know. The situation is not transparent.
FM: Thank you so much for the interview. Can we get a photo with you?
SZ: Okay, okay. But I hate my stupid face. Oh, this photo will look like something that should be titled “Dumb and Dumber.” Ugh, my stupid face. It’s horrible, just horrible. There’s a Slovenian saying. It looks like it’s been pulled out of a cow’s ass.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 10, 2012, at 12:43 a.m.
Harvard University brought a lawsuit this week asking a federal judge to direct the U.S. Marshals Service to evict the Embassy of the Republic of Cameroon from Harvard-owned property that the embassy currently occupies in Washington, D.C.
According to a court document, the lease held by Cameroon’s permanent ministry to the U.S. expired on Jan. 31, but the embassy has not yet vacated the office building.
“This is a straightforward landlord-and-tenant dispute,” lawyers representing Harvard wrote in a court filing. “The Embassy continues to occupy the premises and has not provided any indication of when it will vacate.”
When its permanent headquarters in Washington, D.C., began undergoing renovations in April 2010, the Cameroon embassy leased the building in question from its previous owner. Harvard then purchased the building for $7 million in 2011.
When Harvard took ownership of the building, Cameroon Ambassador Joseph B. C. Foe-Atangana signed an agreement stating that the terms of the previous lease still applied, including a Jan. 31, 2012, expiration date, according to Harvard’s court filing.
Although the Embassy of Cameroon would normally have immunity against lawsuits such as Harvard’s, its lease on the building contained a provision in which it waived numerous protections ordinarily granted by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, the court document said.
According to the filing, Harvard learned in the fall of 2011 that the renovations at the embassy’s permanent headquarters had fallen behind schedule. In December, Harvard’s lawyers wrote, the University “notified the embassy that it would be willing to consider a limited three-month extension of the Lease Term.”
But when Harvard’s trustees “did not receive any substantive communication” from the embassy, they withdrew the offer of an extension on the lease on Jan. 30.
The Cameroon embassy did not respond to repeated requests for comment on Thursday.
“We would like to be flexible,” University spokesperson Kevin Galvin said. “We remain open to working out an extension, but without any response from the embassy, we felt that we had to move forward.”
Harvard purchased the building, located at 1700 Wisconsin Ave., in order to expand the Dumbarton Oaks research library.
Dumbarton Oaks director Jan M. Ziolkowski told The Crimson in September that the library planned to significantly remodel the building to house its research fellows.

In response to the firing of two custodial workers over immigration paperwork issues, the Service Employees International Union Local 615 has begun efforts to get the workers reinstated.
Both workers were Harvard University custodians employed by Unicco Service Company, which the University contracts for janitorial services.
A delegation of about 15 people, primarily made up of workers, delivered a petition with more than 80 worker signatures to the Unicco offices at the Harvard Business School at 2:30 p.m. on Thursday, demanding that Harvard give the two workers their jobs back.
Michael A. Sylvester, deputy director of higher education for SEIU Local 615, said that a manager at Unicco started to ask workers to provide documentation of their immigration status, with a deadline of two weeks to submit the papers. According to Sylvester, Unicco was acting under the terms of an old contract, but the current one has no two-week time limit.
Sylvester said that both employees submitted paperwork showing that their immigration statuses were “all in order.” However, because it took one of the custodians longer than two weeks to submit the papers, Unicco fired her about six months ago.
SEIU Local 615 representative Heather S. Vega said that the second custodian had in fact turned in his papers before the two-week deadline. However, Vega said that Unicco lost the paperwork, claimed not to have it, and then found it.
The second custodian was let go about two months ago, before the papers were found. Both custodians are currently unemployed.
Unicco also fired a third worker because of a failure to collect the proper paperwork, Sylvester said.
On Thursday, the delegation brought the petition to the office of Unicco manager Edgar Ventura at the Harvard Business School Operations Center. Because Ventura was not in the office, the petition was delivered to his assistant. Ventura did not respond to requests for comment.
Nancy Diaz, a Unicco employee at the Harvard Business School, led the delegation in delivering the petition on the behalf of her coworkers.
“I’m here on behalf of my fellow Unicco workers,” Diaz said. “We will keep on supporting them until they get their jobs back.”
Ventura’s assistant, Edmer Izaguirre, told the delegation that the Unicco human resources department was responsible for handling the matter but that he would pass along the message, Vega said.
Sylvester said that SEIU will pursue further action next week if Unicco is not responsive to the petition’s demands. He would not rule out public protests or demonstrations.
“What we hope to accomplish is to make Unicco reconsider what we see as an unjust policy of selectively choosing employees to look at their immigration status,” Sylvester said. “The idea of the union is that everyone is treated fairly and that the contract sets out rules which allow a discussion between the letter of the law and what’s fair to everybody.”
Clio Griffin ’15, a member of the Student Labor Action Movement, was the only student from the College in the delegation.
“The firings were completely unfair,” Griffin said. “[Harvard] College students will continue to be there to support [the two custodians] until this is settled.”

In a sweeping 417-to-2 vote Thursday, the House of Representatives passed legislation introduced by Sen. Scott P. Brown that bans members of Congress from participating in insider trading and requires them to disclose all personal stock transactions.
Brown filed the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act in the Senate on Nov. 15, and it was approved by a wide margin last week. The House version that passed Thursday differed from the bill approved in the Senate, though, removing a provision to regulate the information provided to hedge funds and mutual funds. The two bills must be reconciled before President Barack Obama can sign the bill into law as he has pledged to do.
In recent weeks, the STOCK Act has been hailed by Democrats and Republicans, including Brown, as a matter of good governance and common sense. But Massachusetts political analysts have suggested that Brown’s interest in the bill is based more on his own political strategy in the U.S. Senate race against Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren than the actual substance of the legislation.
“This measure has to be seen as part of a giant mosaic of a narrative that Brown is trying to create for himself,” said Michael Goldman, a Democratic political consultant in Massachusetts. “He is an extremely wealthy individual who most people in the state do not realize is not a citizen legislator.”
But Republican analysts have said that the legislation was purely a policy issue.
“This was exposed, and he reacted,” said Alicia Preston, a former consultant for Brown. “That’s called being a leader. That’s why he was elected.”
Still, political analysts say that Brown has tried, as he did in 2010, to position himself as an independent everyman of sorts to appeal to Massachusetts voters who are typically farther to the left than the mainstream Republican party.
“This is not going to be a campaign about the issues. This is going to be a campaign about how these two candidates connect with the electorate,”  said M. Marty Linsky, a lecturer at the Harvard Kennedy School. “It’s critical for Brown to maintain the kind of independent posture that he’s worked very hard to create.”
The STOCK Act comes at a time when the personal finances and investments of Congressmen and candidates across the country have come under a great deal of scrutiny.
In January, Brown’s campaign criticized Warren upon the release of her tax returns, calling her out of touch and hypocritical. Warren’s returns showed that the consumer advocate received over $700,000 in compensation in the previous two years.
Political analysts said Brown is using the legislation as a chance to distance himself from similar arguments that could potentially upset his own populist narrative.
“Until Elizabeth Warren decided to run against Scott Brown, he had no interest in reforming anything to do with Wall Street, including insider trading,” Democratic strategist Mary Anne Marsh wrote in an email. “The STOCK Act is just the latest attempt by Brown to distance himself from Wall Street and the GOP leadership.”
Brown’s campaign released a radio advertisement earlier this week publicizing the bill and highlighting what Brown has decried an unfair advantage enjoyed by Congress.
“Serving in elective office is a privilege, not an opportunity for personal gain,” Brown said in the ad.
Though Congress has attempted to tackle insider trading within its ranks in the past, Brown’s involvement beginning last November marked the first time a Republican had taken leadership on the initiative.

A study published this January by dermatologists at Brigham and Women’s Hospital may transform the way physicians approach treatment for leukemic cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (L-CTCL).
L-CTCL is a cancer that affects a type of white blood cell known as the T-cell and causes damage to the skin and other organs. Once diagnosed, patients with the disease generally have a poor prognosis—with an average of three years to live.
BWH Department of Dermatology chairman Thomas S. Kupper and BWH assistant professor of dermatology Rachael A. Clark led a study which explored the efficacy of a new drug regimen to treat L-CTCL. Their report, which was published in Science Translational Medicine, showed that a low dosage of the drug Campath, or alemtuzumab, combats L-CTCL by selectively targeting cancer cells. In addition, they found that the low-dose Campath allows for treatment without increasing their patients’ risk of acquiring infections.
“Standard chemotherapies and alemtuzumab can put L-CTCL into partial or complete remission, but the disease is not curable and eventually will recur,” Kupper wrote in an emailed statement to The Crimson.
Much of Clark and Kupper’s work involved understanding Campath’s interaction with the immune system, specifically T-cells. Though previously believed to kill all T-cells and B-cells—the cells at the frontline of the immune response—the researchers found that Campath actually only kills T-cells that enter the blood stream.
“The amazing thing about Campath is that it kills all the T-cells in the circulation but it doesn’t kill the T-cells in the skin,” said Clark. “They [the T-cells in the skin] are protected from the medication because they don’t circulate.”
Through the course of the study, Clark and Kupper administered Campath to patients with L-CTCL. They found that the patients improved most significantly when given low doses of the drug. In order to study the physiological effects of the drug, the researchers then took blood samples and skin biopsies. Upon examination, they found that T-cells in the skin remained greatly unaffected as the patients improved.
“We sampled their skin through skin biopsies [and] found large numbers of T-cells in the skin,” Clark said. “Here was the drug that was supposed to kill all the T-cells and yet there they were.”
With this finding, Clark and Kupper were led to further investigate the nature of these unaffected skin T-cells. Their research demonstrated for the first time that there were two types of T-cell populations in humans and validated extensive research on the migratory patterns of T-cells within tissues.
“This is still a very novel concept—a sort of paradigm shift in the way we view the immune system—but our work and that of others suggest that we need to pay very close attention to what is happening in tissues,” said Kupper.
With the publication of these ground-breaking findings, the scientists wished to acknowledge the patients who participated in their research.
“The real heroes of this work are our patients, who in spite of this devastating disease willingly and often enthusiastically donated their blood and skin biopsies for this work,” said Kupper.

In his new book, “The Life of Super-Earths,” astronomy professor Dimitar D. Sasselov claims that a class of planets called Super-Earths may be our best chances for finding extraterrestrial life. He draws on complementary discoveries in biology and astronomy in what he calls “an unlikely marriage.” Each spring, Sasselov teaches Science of the Physical Universe 30: “Life as a Planetary Phenomenon,” a General Education course.
The Harvard Crimson: What are Super-Earths and what makes you believe that they could contain life?
Dimitar D. Sasselov: Super-Earths are how we call a family of planets...up to two times larger and about ten times more massive than the Earth. [These kinds of] planets could have very similar environments to the ones that we’re used to here on Earth, but also be more stable over long periods of time. This potentially makes [Super-Earths] as good for habitability as our own is.
THC: If we found extraterrestrial life, do you think it would resemble humans? What would be some similarities or differences?
DDS: I’m almost certain that it’s not going to resemble us in any way. And the reason for that statement is that, first of all, even if it was based on the same chemistry...that allows for such a richness of diversity that life could go in many different directions. It will still be life, but it’s not going to resemble anything that happened here on Earth. On the other hand, if the chemistry is different, that will make it [resemble us] even less so.
THC: Are we alone in the universe? How long will it be before we find out the answer?
DDS: People quite often think of the question “Are we alone in the universe?” in terms of other civilizations out there: life forms that have reached at least our level of technological development. That question is very difficult to answer right now, but certainly if we could answer the first question, which is, “Is life on other planets possible and is it common in the universe?” then that will be a major step to answering the second one. I think that science now is progressing at the pace where within our lifetimes, we will have a pretty good answer to the first question about life on other planets.
THC: What got you interested in astronomy as a child?
DDS: I grew up in Bulgaria in a small city on the Black Sea Coast, so I was very interested in the sea, marine life, and everything related to it. But it was also a very dark place at night, so I could see the stars. And I just got very interested in it. My parents gave me a small telescope, then I built my own, and one thing led to another. So that’s how I ended up going from being a hobby astronomer to a professional astronomer.
THC: What advice would you give for students interested in astronomy?
DDS: Learn biology as well, because the future of astronomy has a lot of biology and chemistry in it. That’s the direction in which we are moving in our research. In 20 years, there will be a lot more happening at the forefront of biology on exoplanets.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals, a Cambridge-based pharmaceutical company, received FDA approval last week for its new cystic fibrosis treatment. While all previous CF treatments have fought the disease by mitigating its symptoms, this treatment fights the disease by remedying the cause.
Kalydeco, Vertex’s CF therapy, fights a branch of CF caused by a particular mutation found in approximately 1,200 people in the United States, 1,000 in the EU, and 180 in Ireland—areas where the mutation is most prevalent. Kalydeco functions by binding to the protein deformed by the CF mutation and helping it open properly to regain its normal function.
This treatment is a major development in the treatment of CF—a fatal genetic disorder caused by mutations that deform or destroy proteins responsible for regulating salt and water flow in many cells. The protein’s loss of function results in a characteristic buildup of thick, sticky mucus in the respiratory pathway that may cause chronic lung infections and long-term respiratory damage.
“We’re extremely happy with the results, and we’re especially happy for the patients,” said Chris I. Wright ’87, senior vice president and head of global medicines development and affairs at Vertex. “This represents a transformation in the care of the subset of the patients that have CF. We’re happy with the way this drug has been able to improve their lives.”
As an example of personalized medicine, Wright said this treatment is a “very highly targeted therapy.”
“The drug was specifically developed to target the defective protein in that particular subset [of patients],” he continued.
Vertex received FDA approval for Kalydeco relatively quickly, by FDA standards. Wright said the FDA’s speedy approval can be credited to the profundity of Kalydeco’s approach and its “excellent clinical data.”
Patients could breathe more easily, exhale more easily, and there was a 55 percent reduction in emergency-level respiratory changes, which reduced hospital visits. Patients on Kalydeco also experienced weight gain, offsetting the weight loss common among CF patients.
Wright also emphasized the novelty of the treatment, noting, “This is really the first medication that treats the underlying cause of the disease. Other treatments out there treat the symptoms, such as bronchodilators, but this treats the cause. It completely changes the paradigm of how to treat this disease.”
Mihaela G. Gadjeva is assistant professor of medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. On the development of Kalydeco, Gadjeva said, “it seems to be very promising in bringing clinical results.”
While Gadjeva acknowledged that Kalydeco directly helps only a small portion of the CF patient population, she said that it opens the door to new treatments and that “it is a great step forward in providing CF patients with some form of treatment.”
Vertex’s current goal, besides quickly distributing Kalydeco to patients in need, is to develop cures for other CF-causing gene mutations using the Kalydeco approach. Wright said that Vertex is now studying a different mutation which plays a role in approximately 90 percent of CF patients.

The decision to pursue laboratory research at Harvard was an easy one for Andrew K. Cohen ’13.
An Intel semifinalist his senior year of high school, Cohen worked for three years to test how paper waste could be converted into biofuel.
“Research was kind of my favorite thing,” he said.
But the Environmental Science and Public Policy concentrator has since traded gels for case studies in business and policy—a shift in interest largely inspired by his time behind the laboratory bench.
Driven by the interest in biofuels he had fostered throughout high school, Cohen first sought out Harvard Medical School genetics professor George M. Church, one of just a few Harvard professors involved in biofuel research, the fall of his sophomore year.
“I went there first week of September, told him I was interested, and he said, ‘Let’s find you a spot,’” Cohen recalled.
That “spot” would entail genetically engineering bacteria to improve their ability to convert plants into biofuels. Because the genome of the bacterium studied in Church’s lab is known, Cohen and his mentor, Andrew C. Tolonen, were able to predict which genetic changes would best enhance the biofuel-generative capacity of the bacterium. Cohen inserted DNA into each bacterial genome to create these different versions, which could then be tested.
Cohen said the best part of research is the “intellectual autonomy.”
“If you’re working at a hedge fund, you don’t really get to play around with their money and see if your investment ideas work,” he said. “But if you work in a research lab—especially if you work with the right people who trust your hands—you can really think of your best ideas, and kind of get to see that start to finish.”
But after working in the laboratory for a semester, Cohen quickly realized that collegiate research was not everything he had anticipated.
“It was getting really hard,” he said. “The level of research that was expected was way beyond what I was doing in high school.”
Cohen was also discovering a new passion: the intersection of policy and economics in the implementation of renewable energy technologies. After taking Environmental Science and Public Policy 90s: “The Technology, Economics, and Public Policy of Renewable Energy” with Harvard Business School professor George P. Baker ’79, Cohen found himself deeply drawn to the process of making renewable technologies a reality.
Tolonen said he is not surprised that Cohen decided to pursue a different route. “In addition to being an excellent scientist, he clearly had a big focus on understanding the sciences of bioenergy and how it could be applied in the real world,” Tolonen said, adding that even while working in the lab Cohen was a member of Harvard’s bioenergy club.
And he emphasized that Cohen brings a unique and important perspective to the business and politics of renewable energy. “It’s only people like Andy who have worked in a lab and understand the science who can push the policy,” Tolonen said.

Ancient human social networks exhibited several of the same properties as those of modern networks, a new Nature study suggests. The study, co-authored by professor of sociology Nicholas A. Christakis, is “one of the first, and maybe only, studies to map social cooperation in humans,” according to  Coren L. Apicella, a post-doctoral fellow in Christakis’s lab who spearheaded the research.
Over the past few years, the team of researchers mapped the social networks of the Hadza, an ethnic group of hunter-gatherers in Tanzania.
The researchers used a photographic census, which Apicella called “a pencil and paper version of Facebook,” to determine social ties among the Hadza.
“The Hadza provide a window into our ancient past, as we probe the evolutionary and biological origins of this crazy thing we do: making social networks,” Christakis wrote in an email.
Of particular note among the shared properties between the Hadza and modern populations is homophily, the tendency for friends to be similar in a number of traits. The researchers found that cooperators tend to be friends with other cooperators, and defectors acted in a similar manner.
“You do see cooperation in other animals for sure, but humans are really unique in the sense that we form long-lasting non-reproductive bonds with other individuals,” said Apicella.
Apicella explained that there are two main hypothesized explanations for homophily.
The first is that “birds of a feather flock together,” meaning that individuals seek others who are like them.
The second explanation is that individuals influence their friends’ behavior in a cascading effect, leading to communities with similar traits.
According to Apicella, the Hadza social structure is set up in a way consistent with the “birds of a feather” hypothesis: as hunter-gatherers, the Hadza have few possessions and are not tied down to a particular location.
“We see that camp membership is very fluid,” said Apicella.
Homophily is one of the many social traits that Christakis’s lab seeks to explain.
“My lab is interested in the deep roots of human social organization: how and why do we assemble ourselves into a sort of human super-organism?” Christakis asked.
In the field, the researchers asked Hadza individuals whom they would like to live with in their next camp and to whom they’d give a stick of honey, using the “pencil and paper version of Facebook” to identify social ties.
“[The Hadza] loved looking at these photos, just as we like looking at photos of our friends on Facebook,” said Apicella.
“Even when they weren’t conducting fieldwork, they would come and ask Coren, ‘can we look at the pictures?’” she added. “It’s really touching upon something that’s very human.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A crowd of more than 100 protesters gathered outside the Holyoke Center Thursday night in response to plans to reorganize Harvard University Library that could include involuntary staff reductions.
The protestors chanted and marched in a circle, after which several workers, students, and other supporters spoke to the crowd. They then walked into the Yard and circled Massachusetts Hall several times.
The rally sought to increase awareness in the Harvard community about the library workers’ concerns as well as to display opposition to the administration’s intentions, said William P. Whitham ’14, a member of the Student Labor Action Movement.
“I hope this lets the student leaders, lets the faculty know that this ‘glorious’ reorganization has a human cost,” Whitham said.
Library assistant Jeffrey Booth, who has worked at Harvard libraries for nearly 26 years, said that the threat of staff reductions makes him worried about his family.
“Our futures are at stake,” Booth said. “We’ve already had to make tough personal decisions because of the threat of being laid off.”
Library employee and elected Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers representative Emeka F. Onyeagoro, who spoke at the rally, said that he was opposed to the layoffs, which he said threatened an estimated 800 to 1,000 workers.
Onyeagoro said the layoffs have no financial basis, but are an unjustified attempt at greater efficiency.
Layoffs would also negatively affect workers who kept their jobs, since they would be faced with a greater workload, Onyeagoro said.
Ricardo R. S. Rey, a teaching fellow in the history department, said that he opposed the layoffs for practical, as well as philosophical reasons. He recalled an instance where he wasted time searching for documents with HOLLIS before a librarian helped him find a wealth of materials for his class.
“How are we going to find this [without librarians]?” Salazar said.
“There are people [here] that don’t normally go to rallies,” Booth, who is also a HUCTW member, said. “It’s hard to get up out of your seat and do something.”
Last Friday, HUCTW leaders met with library officials for a conversation that HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger described as “honest,” “difficult,” and “inconclusive.”
“So far we haven’t seen a change of heart, but we’re going to keep pressing, and press harder,” Jaeger said.
Jaeger said that the union still had two major concerns that the library board had not addressed sufficiently, if at all.
“We’re baffled by the unnecessary cloak of secrecy,” Jaeger said. “We don’t understand why such a committed and intelligent group would not have more access [to the community].”
HUCTW’s second concern, according to Jaeger, was that some library functions are already understaffed.
“We’re going to fight for great libraries and great jobs,” Jaeger said.
Yet Desiree A. Goodwin, a library assistant who spoke at the protest, said that HUCTW, of which she is a member, has not offered much information either.
“They’re not really telling us anything,” Goodwin said. “Not unlike the library board.”
Jaeger said that the email Faust sent on Wednesday to the Harvard community was encouraging to HUCTW members, since it referenced staff engagement.
Jaeger added, however, that so far, the administrations’s words and actions have not been consistent.
“There’s a worrisome disconnect between that quotation and the practical accessibility that our members have,” Jaeger said.
Booth said that he and his fellow workers found the content of the email to be misleading.
“They expect us to believe her assertions because she’s Drew Faust,” Booth said. “And that is insulting.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The audience in Sanders Theatre heard speeches on topics ranging from symmetry in Beethoven’s music, to incarceration in the U.S., to genetically modified food on Thursday evening, all in the space of an 80-minute event.
At the third annual Harvard Thinks Big forum, eight esteemed Harvard professors addressed a packed house for just ten minutes each in a whirlwind tour of big ideas in academia.
American history professor Jill Lepore discussed the board game created by Harvard dropout Milton Bradley in 1860, originally titled “The Checkered Game of Life.” She traced the genesis of Bradley’s game, now well-known as “The Game of Life,” from its roots in ancient Indian games to its latest incarnation, the 2007 edition “The Game of Life: Twists and Turns.”
Lepore used the lighthearted parlor game to analyze a big idea indeed—the transformation of the meaning of life over time.
“Most questions about life and death have no answers,” Lepore said. “No one has ever answered these questions and nobody ever will, but everyone tries. Trying is the human condition and history is the chronicle of asking.”
In the latest version, Lepore said, “Life is aimless. There is a place to begin called ‘start.’ You cannot die. You cannot grow old. You cannot sin. You cannot be good. There is no end. What is the meaning of life in the game of twist and turns? Technically, the game is endless, because its only object is to experience all that life has to offer.”
But human and evolutionary biology professor Daniel E. Lieberman ’86 said in his talk that people do have a definite path—and it points toward junk food.
Lieberman said that industrialized humans are evolutionarily inclined to eat up “all the Twinkies and sweets that come our way.”
“For most of evolutionary history, there was a struggle of human survival. We didn’t evolve to like exercising or celery,” Lieberman said. “Recently, we are able to indulge these desires to an extent that natural selection never let us in the past.”
He blamed industrialization for ushering in overconsumption, higher rates of certain diseases, and widespread laziness.
English professor Stephen J. Greenblatt discussed Shakespeare’s remarkably innovative use of language and the staying power of the written word.
“Literature carries, as Shakespeare understood, a unique record of experience,” Greenblatt said. “To grapple with literature is to speak with the dead.”
Peter D. Davis ’12, who hosted the event, said, “My goal was for this to solidify Harvard Thinks Big as a tradition, for it to be something that people look forward to, something that makes Harvard, Harvard.”
He added, “Like the Oscars, we like to add something new.”
That added touch at this year’s iteration of the event was performances by the student band The Nostalgics throughout the evening.
“In my three years at Harvard, Harvard Thinks Big is one of my favorite events,” said K. C. Jaski ’13. “Harvard Thinks Big is like an intellectual rock concert, complete with inspiration, goose bumps, and great music.”

UPDATED: Feb. 10 at 8:10 p.m.
The 2011 concentration satisfaction scores for history and literature edged past those of the English department, which had the highest satisfaction score among large concentrations in 2010, according to the FAS records of the 2011 Exit Surveys.
The three largest humanities departments—history and literature, English, and history—all scored above a 4.2 out of 5 in the concentration satisfaction surveys, which The Crimson obtained last week.
Economics and government, two of the largest social science concentrations, saw marked reductions in satisfaction scores between 2010 and 2011.
Government scores fell from a 3.91 rating to a 3.65 rating, while economics slid from a 3.71 to 3.32.
History and literature, history, and psychology all showed improvement between 2010 and 2011.
History and literature concentrator Anh M. Le ’12 attributed the high ratings to the personal relationships forged in the department between faculty and students.
“It’s nice to walk into the office and have the head of the department know my name,” she said, adding that she is one of only four students in the department’s Early Modern Europe track.
Le said that she also appreciated the flexibility of the concentration, which allows students to design their own curriculum for the junior tutorial. In fact, she said that her only criticism of the program was that she hadn’t been able to take more history and literature seminars.
“I’ll rate it very highly, definitely above 4.5,” she said.
Lawrence K. Barchok ’12, an economics concentrator, also said that he would rate his concentration above a four, but with some reservations.
“In terms of one-on-one meetings with professors, I can see why the satisfaction level is lower,” he said. “I think they should do a better job at advising.”
Concentration advising has been a “perennial problem,” economics department chair John Y. Campbell said.
“We would love to do better in those surveys,” he said.
Barchok also cited the cancellation of junior seminars for the class of 2011 and the limited selection of junior seminars for the class of 2012 as major sources of dissatisfaction.
However, the department is not entirely to blame for low scores, he said.
“People take [economics] as a default concentration, not necessarily out of interest,” he said.
English Department Chair W. James Simpson said that his department’s consistently high ratings are the result of a three-year-old curriculum with a greater focus on faculty advising.
“Our motto in the last two years has been ‘concentrate on the concentrators,’” he said.
According to Simpson, face-to-face interactions are key. “It’s just that simple—getting to know people makes a big difference.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A dearth of positive portrayals of women in the media has helped cause a disproportionately low percentage of women in leadership positions in government and business, filmmaker Jennifer Siebel Newsom said at an event on Thursday sponsored by the Harvard Kennedy School’s Women and Gender Caucus.
Newsom’s 2011 documentary “Miss Representation” criticizes mainstream media for broadcasting hyper-sexualized images of women on reality television and tabloid news, while simultaneously ignoring or trivializing female leaders.
“I’m a firm believer in ‘If you can’t see it, you can’t be it,’” Newsom said, arguing that more balanced public images of women would teach young girls that they can aspire to positions of power.
Newsom, who worked in micro-finance before earning a business degree from Stanford, said she was inspired to write, direct, and produce the film after learning that she was pregnant with her first child, a daughter.
“I started to question what the media was communicating to young people,” Newsom said. “I couldn’t imagine having a daughter in a culture that demeaned, objectified, and sexualized women.”
The movie premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and has since aired on Oprah Winfrey’s television network. Newsom is currently conducting a nationwide tour and an online campaign to promote the film, which is the centerpiece of an educational curriculum geared toward elementary, middle, and high school students.
The film has been screened in 1,500 schools across the country. More than 60 screenings are scheduled for the month of March alone, in locations ranging from Arkansas to Azerbaijan.
For Kennedy School student M. Manuela C. Faria, Newsom’s speech brought back memories of the 2008 presidential primary season, when she heard friends and co-workers critiquing Hillary Clinton.
“Highly intelligent women said, ‘She’s too ambitious,’” Faria said. “I thought, ‘That’s not a complete thought.’ They meant too ambitious for a woman.”
Theresa A. Lund, associate director of the Kennedy School’s Women and Public Policy Program, called Newsom’s film “well-made, thought-provoking, and compelling.”
“Many of those who attended today’s screening left inspired and eager to change how women are portrayed in our culture,” Lund said.

Nazila Fathi, an Iranian journalist for The New York Times and other publications, discussed her perilous experiences as a reporter and her eventual exile from her homeland in a speech before more than 50 students, faculty members, and local residents on Thursday evening.
Fathi spoke about how she came to be a reporter in such tumultuous territory.
“In 1991, many reporters came to Iran to report on an earthquake,” Fathi recalled. “They needed a translator.... That was the beginning of my career as a journalist. The journalism bug bit me.”
She recounted numerous anecdotes of life as a reporter under an oppressive regime.
“There were restrictions, there was red tape. There were times when my press card was revoked. There were dozens of social stories that the government didn’t care about,” Fathi said.
In June 2009, Fathi reported on the controversial Iranian election, in which incumbent president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad defeated reformist candidate Mir-Hossein Mousavi. Dispute over the legitimacy of the election sparked widespread revolt.
“I saw the most amazing scene that I have ever seen in my life,” Fathi said. “The 6-mile street was packed with people, and the square was packed as well. Three million people had come despite government warning.”
When government officials noticed Fathi’s extensive reporting on the protests, she found herself under surveillance and began receiving death threats.
“One of those days I was going out, I received a call from someone who said, ‘Nazila, they have identified you and they have snipers,’” Fathi said. “I still went out that day, because it was impossible not to.”
For the safety of her family, she decided to leave Iran—temporarily, she thought.
“When I left Iran, I brought only a few t-shirts. I always expected to go back,” Fathi said.
But after extending her time out of the country repeatedly, Fathi said she still does not feel safe enough to return.
She spent 2011 as a fellow at the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard and is currently a fellow at Harvard’s Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics, and Public Policy.
Thursday’s talk was sponsored by the Harvard Writers at Work lecture series, which “emphasizes that Expos is not just a class that you’re taking, but something that has many different applications in the real world—something that you can be passionate about,” said Andrea Pitzer, a journalist who founded the Nieman Storyboard website.
Victoria Zhuang ’15 agreed that the lecture was “expanding.”
“This helped me cultivate awareness of events around the world,” Zhuang said.

After weeks of silence from top administrators about their plans to restructure the University’s library system, University President Drew G. Faust and Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 sent emails to the Harvard community that provided some details on future plans but left questions on staff reorganization unanswered.
While Faust and Garber specified initiatives the University would pursue, such as greater partnerships with peer universities, they largely avoided the question of staff reductions.
“Our goal is not only to equal the best that’s out there, but to move beyond and indeed be the flagship research library for the 21st century,” Garber told The Crimson on Friday.
In his email, Garber listed plans that included mobile checkout and self-checkout systems and improved collection development.
Aside from efforts to adapt to a digital age, the library restructuring will aim to unify Harvard’s 73 currently independent libraries. Under the new system, libraries across the University’s schools will be lumped into five “affinity groups,” each of which will represent a different academic sector. Each library will maintain a relationship with its associated school as well.
University administrators have said that the library transition will require reorganization of library staff. But despite calls from staff members to clarify the details of the intended reorganization, Faust and Garber largely steered clear of the issue in their emails.
“We recognize that members of the talented Library staff are anxious to see how the transition will affect them as individuals, and we are confident that our new strategic direction will ultimately produce gratifying new responsibilities and career development opportunities,” Garber wrote.
Garber acknowledged in his Friday interview with The Crimson that there would be a “shift in staff,” but he declined to comment directly on the potential for staff reductions.
Harvard University Library Executive Director Helen Shenton previously said at a town hall meeting with library employees that “the Library workforce will be smaller than it is now.”
According to Garber, the University will release more details to staff on the future of their positions over the next two weeks.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lin-ning and grinning. Lin-tensity. Lin-ning streak.
 
 We've heard all the nicknames and wordplay, but none captures the hype surrounding Jeremy Lin ’10 better than Lin-sanity. Sports fans around the nation—and especially in New York—have a huge case of it, and it's pretty clear why.  
 
 Before the season started, huge expectations were placed on a team that features two NBA All-Stars and a defending NBA champion center. The Knicks were supposed to vie for one of the top spots in the Eastern Conference and make a big run in the playoffs, but for the first 23 games, New York fans watched incredulously as their team moved into 10th place and lacked the chemistry needed to win it all. Critics blamed it all on the lack of a true point guard, and though rookie Iman Shumpert played well at the one spot in his first few starts, Shumpert was not consistent and exposed his tendency for playing as a combo guard.  
 
 New   York coach Mike D'Antoni had already tried Toney Douglas, but he was clearly not the answer. D'Antoni also gave veteran Mike Bibby a try, but he couldn't get a fluid offense going. The Knicks then signed former All-Star Baron Davis, hoping that once back from a herniated disc injury, he could save the team from a losing season. New York also picked up Lin off of waivers in December to reinforce an inconsistent backcourt, but the second-year player was primarily kept on the bench, and in his limited time on the court, Lin didn’t do so well, to say the least. 
 
 Over a month passed since then—a period that saw Lin briefly go to the D-League—and Knicks fans had begun clamoring for D'Antoni's head and hoping for Davis to speed up his recovery. Last week, New York entered its only back-to-back-to-back series of the shortened season, and many analysts expected D'Antoni's head to roll if the Knicks did not grab at least one win from either the Boston Celtics, the Chicago Bulls, or the New Jersey Nets.  
 
 Two losses later, the Knicks hosted the Nets at Madison Square Garden, and D'Antoni needed to throw a Hail Mary. And so, D’Antoni gave Jeremy Lin a shot, and we have all been witnesses to Lin did to Deron Williams and the Nets, Devin Harris and the Utah Jazz, and John Wall and the Washington Wizards. 
 
 Lin may not have only saved D'Antoni's job for now but his as well. The former Harvard guard played well just in time for his contract to become guaranteed for the rest of the season. In an interview with Yahoo! Sports radio affiliate 95.7 The Game, Lin stated that the general manager told him Wednesday that his contract was guaranteed, admitting the news was "a sigh of relief." Lin did not disappoint later that night with a 23-point, 10-assist outing, despite the fact that the Knicks were still missing key players Carmelo Anthony (groin injury) and Amare Stoudemire (death in the family).  
 
As Bill Simmons pointed out on Twitter earlier today, Lin is currently second in all of basketball in the player efficiency ratings, right behind none other than LeBron James. In his 12 games played, Lin is posting a PER of 26.83, .23 better than NBA All-Star Kevin Durant. With his improved play and the impressive stats, there are people already thinking about Lin’s future and how the Knicks should try to keep him.  
 
 Had D'Antoni not given Lin the opportunity, the former Crimson standout may have faced a similar fate as he did with the Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets—both teams waived Lin to make space in hopes of signing a center. Now Rockets GM Daryl Morey is lamenting his decision to cut Lin, stating on Twitter that “we should have kept @jlin7. Did not know he was this good. Anyone who says they knew misleading U [sic].” 
 
 Another person who can’t be too happy is Wizards coach Randy Wittman, whose son, Ryan, used to play against Lin on the Cornell men’s basketball team. After the game last night, Ryan texted his father, joking how he and his Cornell teammates did a better job containing Lin than the multi-millionaires on the Washington team did.  
 
 While some are realizing their regret and pain, several others are rejoicing the emergence of the newest Knicks star. As described by The Post Game, the Asian-American community is excited to see the first Taiwanese-American player in the NBA thriving on one of the league’s biggest stages. The last time a player of Asian descent generated so much buzz came in 2002, when Yao Ming arrived in the NBA.
 
 The NY Knicks Store is capitalizing on Lin’s breakout performances as well, sending out emails with the subject, “Pre-Order Your Jeremy Lin #17 Jerseys!” It’s a smart idea, especially since Knicks fans have chanted M-V-P to their new hero in the past two home games. Other T-shirt makers, like this one, also plan on reaping in the benefits.  
 
 Even though all these people and companies are happy with Lin’s success, no person can be happier than D’Antoni. He finally has a point guard who in three games has demonstrated that he can run the pick-and-roll, and that is what D’Antoni’s offensive system is all about. As The Back Page pointed out in December, Lin is efficient at scoring but can set up his teammates for the easy PNR. Center Tyson Chandler has found a new best friend in Lin, who is very good at sending passes Chandler’s way for the easy finish. The chemistry is so apparent that Madison Square Garden commentator and NBA Hall of Famer Walt “Clyde” Frazier always states how Chandler will be “taking [Lin] out to dinner soon.”
There is little doubt that Lin’s pick-and-roll should also work with Stoudemire, who is notorious for finishing those types of plays. What will be interesting to see is how Lin coexists with Anthony’s tendency to take over the ball and act as a forward-point guard. Apart from the two absentee stars, Lin has been playing well with the rest of his teammates, setting up open three-point opportunities to Steve Novak and helping Landy Fields, with whom Lin has developed a dorky handshake, take good shots.  
 
 Has D’Antoni found his new Steve Nash? It remains to be seen, though Nash himself is liking what he’s seeing. After three games, some, like Jalen Rose, are buying in to the hype, while others, like Stephen A. Smith, are still wary about the young point guard. But one thing is clear: Lin-sanity has hit the nation hard, and it’s showing no signs of letting up.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By February, many freshmen are finally beginning to settle into a routine, getting a grip on the balance of school and extracurricular activities. But freshman Jarvis Harris has a grip firmer than most.
An hurdler and triple jumper on the Harvard track team, Harris has wasted no time cementing his spot among the team’s top athletes, rewriting a bit of history in the process.
Harris’ collegiate career began with fifth place finishes in both the 60m hurdles and the triple jump at the Harvard Open on Dec. 10. While impressive feats in themselves, they came while Harris was still improving his technique and absorbing lessons from his coaches.
"The biggest thing is adjusting to all these new variables: sleeping in a new bed, having new classes, a new training regimen," Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. "Usually, if freshmen can get back to where they were their senior year of high school, then they’ve had a great year."
With time, Harris’ comfort level grew, and impressive results followed. At the Battle of Beantown invitational, held Feb. 3 at Gordon Indoor Track, Harris posted a school-record time of 8.11 seconds in the 60m hurdles, besting competitors from Northeastern, BU, and MIT for first place. Prior to Harris’ record-setting run, the mark had stood for 11 years—it was also 0.28 seconds faster than the time he ran in December.
"I didn’t know if I had the record or not," Harris said. "The beginning was a little sloppy. Then, I started to hit my rhythm—one-two-three, one-two-three."
However, there was no opportunity for celebration; Harris was scheduled to compete in the triple jump 10 minutes later.
"The triple jump is a whole different mind game," Harris said. "[The events] are similar, but you have to switch moods. Coach didn’t even recognize [the record]. He wouldn’t show that he was excited."
Following a pair of underwhelming jumps in the qualifying round, Harris recognized his timing was slightly off and adjusted his steps accordingly. On his final jump, Harris leaped 14.42m, claiming another first place finish and a meet record in the event.
But the track is not the only stage on which Harris has starred recently. A few weeks ago, he found himself in the middle of his first modeling shoot, arranged by classmate Melisa Noriega.
Noriega, who lives on the floor below Harris in Hollis Hall, works as a correspondent for Seventeen Magazine’s "Freshman 15" series, documenting the first-year college experiences of 15 students around the country. Her assignment from Seventeen called for Noriega to send in photos of eligible male freshmen that girls might want to "hook up with."
"I had the idea to use him as the more athletic type because of his abs," Noriega said.
"We were taking pictures, then my clothes started coming off until I was just in shorts," Harris recalled. "She had me in different poses: ‘Hold the dictionary!’"
Noriega sent in the photos to her editors at Seventeen, who informed her that they would use one of them in the upcoming February issue. Under the caption "The Smartie Jock," the photo features a shirtless Harris, wearing nothing but blue shorts and sunglasses. The accompanying text, authored by Noriega, indicates that "[Harvard girls] are all crushing on him!"
"People were bombarding me with texts," Harris said. "I went over to the [News of the World] stand in Harvard Square and stood there covertly perusing Seventeen Magazine to see my picture."
Though his teammates have tried to poke fun at him for appearing in a magazine targeted at teenage girls, Harris has proved impervious to their taunts.
"It’s the most ridiculous picture of all time," sophomore hurdler Caleb Galoozis said. "But he’s way too proud of it, so bringing it up just inflates his ego."
Encouraged by his debut, Harris continued in the pursuit of his new hobby by auditioning for both the Eleganza and Identities fashion shows, held on campus in the spring.
All flashbulbs aside, Harris’ focus remains on the track. And despite his early success, Harris still remains a work in progress. By his account, he’s grown about an inch during his time at Harvard and added a significant amount of weight through the track team’s weightlifting program.
"Jarvis has all the makings of a great hurdler," Galoozis said. "He’s fast, he’s strong, he’s technically sound; but what’s impressed me most about him is that he sets very high expectations for himself and expects nothing less than to achieve them."
When he masters the finer points of his events, like refining his technique and adapting to the extra three inches added to hurdles in college track, there won’t be much left to hold him back.
"The sky’s the limit for Jarvis," Saretsky said. "He’s going to be a real force in the Ivy League, and if he wants to, he can even mix it up at the national level."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 The Harvard men’s basketball team jumped back into the Associated Press Top 25 and tied a season-high with a No. 21 ranking in the coaches poll this week, but it was an alum of the squad who owned all the headlines.
With three spectacular games in which he went head-to-head with two former All-Stars and a No. 1 overall pick—against whom he averaged 25.3 points and 8.3 assists—Jeremy Lin ’10 quickly became one of the most-discussed items in the sports world.
In less than a week, Lin singlehandedly caused New York City to forget that the Giants won the Super Bowl on Sunday, helped Knicks fans discover that basketball can actually be fun to watch, and made Mike D’Antoni remember how effective his system can be when there’s a true point guard running it.
All of a sudden, Lin was a bigger Broadway hit than "Book of Mormon," the first Harvard affiliate to play the role of the triumphant underdog since Matt Damon in "Invictus," and the first New Yorker ever to excel at driving through traffic.
Linsanity became the talk of the Linternet—trending worldwide three times on Twitter in five days—as the punning industry was revived with sayings such as "Just Lin Baby."
By Thursday night, Lin had a higher player efficiency rating than Kevin Durant, Dwight Howard, and Dwayne Wade, had been praised by Magic Johnson and Steve Nash, had become the first player since Isiah Thomas 30 years ago to put up 28 and eight in his first career start, and the first since LeBron in 2002 to go for 20 and eight in his first two starts.
That’s two Hall of Famers and five future Hall of Famers in one paragraph—not bad company for someone who for two months was believed to be less talented than Toney Douglas and Mike Bibby.
Yes, Linception has occurred, and the dream is real.
While doing all this, Lin was often referred to as "the point guard from Harvard," implicitly reminding everyone that indeed, Harvard has a basketball team and, in fact, it’s very good.
And this weekend, the Crimson’s perfect conference record will be on the line during what will be its toughest road trip of the year. Penn and Princeton are two teams in the upper echelon of the conference, and both are dangerous enough to defeat Harvard on their home floors.
So tonight, as Lin prepares for his toughest task yet versus Kobe Bryant and the Lakers, his former teammates are also in for a big challenge against Zack Rosen and the Quakers (+1 for rhyming!).
HARVARD (20-2, 6-0 Ivy) AT PENN (12-10, 4-1)
Many will likely compare this game to one from two years ago, when a 20-3 No. 22 Cornell squad went into Philly and got smoked worse than a Don Draper cigarette, losing 79-64 to a Penn team that had been 3-15 to that point.
This year’s Quakers are a lot better than 2010’s, and—as Harvard learned in last year’s thrilling double-overtime victory—The Palestra is as tough an arena to win in as there is in Ivy basketball.
Rosen has turned into the league’s best guard, ranking second in the conference with 18.3 points and first with 6.0 assists per game. He has quietly become the biggest Jewish basketball sensation since...um...Omri Casspi? Jordan Farmar? Can we officially count Amar’e now?
Okay, so the competition’s not great. But Rosen’s good. And I’m sure his grandmother is very proud. He’s also a senior, meaning he’s well aware that this is his last chance to go dancing (his future wedding Horah not included).
But Harvard, for its part, may very well have Rosen’s kryptonite, and it’s not a bad piece of gefilte fish.
No, in the land of the cheesesteak, the difference maker may be cheesecake.
"Cheesecake" is the nickname of Harvard’s Brandyn Curry. The junior point guard—who is statistically the best lockdown defender in the Ancient Eight—and the rest of Harvard’s outstanding defense should make things very tough for Rosen and company offensively.
Meanwhile, starting four guards, the Quakers lack the size to defend Keith Wright and Kyle Casey at the other end. If Laurent Rivard and the other Harvard shooters can match Penn’s long-ball ability (Tyler Bernadini and Rosen rank first and third in the league in three-point percentage, respectively), the Crimson should be able to pull out another close victory in Philly.
Pick: Harvard 67, Penn 63
BROWN (7-16, 1-5) AT COLUMBIA (13-9, 2-4)
The Lions played a weird pair of games last week. On Friday, they barely squeaked past Dartmouth, 64-62, and then on Saturday came out and played Harvard as tough as anyone has all year (UConn notwithstanding). The Crimson has the third-longest home winning streak in the country, but the Lions stayed in the game from start to finish at Lavietes Pavilion.
So it’s tough to know what to expect from Columbia. But Brown let me down last week with its Friday loss—my only wrong pick on the season thus far—while the Lions are at home and, in Brian Barbour, have the best player on either team. So we’ll go with them.
Pick: Columbia 65, Brown 62
DARTMOUTH (4-18, 0-6) AT PRINCETON (11-10, 2-3)
Last week, we made a "Least Athletic Lions" team. This week, let’s do the same with Tigers—I’m thinking Tigger from Winnie the Pooh, Prince Fielder nine years from now, Tony from Frosted Flakes (he’s not Grrrrreat), Calvin’s buddy Hobbes, and former mustachioed French Prime Minister Georges "Le Tigre" Clemenceau.
And yes, once again, that squad would still beat Dartmouth.
Pick: Princeton 70, Dartmouth 61
YALE (15-5, 5-1) at CORNELL (8-12, 3-3)
The Bulldogs rebounded nicely last weekend from their embarrassing defeat to Harvard, sweeping the Killer P’s and in so doing keeping themselves alive in the Ivy race. Yale should dominate Cornell inside in this one, as the Big Red simply do not have anyone capable of defending Greg Mangano.
Also, one wonders: who would Clifford the Big Red Dog root for in this game?
Pick: Yale 74, Cornell 67
HARVARD AT PRINCETON
Ugh, we’re doing this again?
At The Crimson, we’re not supposed to use the word "revenge" in our sportswriting, as it sounds mean, like something a crazy serial killer might be after. Instead, we’re encouraged to use a nicer word, like "retribution."
Nope. Not this time. This is for revenge. Only a little bit, of course, but last year still hurts. And at least a serial killer is nice enough to end their victims’ lives on the spot, rather than tearing out their hearts by preventing them from doing something they haven’t done in 65 years and then forcing them to suffer for eleven long months afterwards.
So no, this is not a do-or-die game, like last year’s playoff, but it would still be nice beat the Tigers and Doug Davis on their home court—even if Dan Mavraides and his villainous taunts are no longer there to make winning even sweeter.
But doing so will be no easy task. The last time Harvard won in Jadwin Gymnasium, the Berlin Wall was still standing.
Pick: Harvard 68, Princeton 64
BROWN AT CORNELL
After deciding to transfer from Toledo, Brown’s Stephen Albrecht originally committed to Cornell, then backed out and went to Brown.
Technically, Albrecht is only a sophomore, though he’ll be 23 in August. That means by the time he graduates, he’ll be pushing Abe Liu/Andrew Hatch levels of elderliness.
In any case, Albrecht would’ve been a nice fit in Cornell’s backcourt with Chris Wroblewski, whose numbers have dipped in every offensive category this season.
Alas, much to the despair of Mr. Cornell Basketball Blog, it was not meant to be. But despite not having Albrecht, the Big Red should still win this game at home.
Pick: Cornell 66, Brown 60
YALE AT COLUMBIA
I think this will be closer than one might expect. The second game of the New York road trip is always tough, since Ithaca and New York City are nowhere near each other.
And Columbia—unlike a lot of other teams in the Ancient Eight—has the size to matchup well with the Bulldogs, led by one-half of the "Sweatband Boys," Mark Cisco. (The other half of the duo is Andre Drummond’s proctologist, Blaise Staab—google image him.)
Though Cisco has the talent to frustrate Mangano, Yale on the whole is simply a much better team. But be on upset alert with this one.
Pick: Yale 67, Columbia 63
DARTMOUTH AT PENN
Let’s just say you could take the five least athletic Quakers...
Only kidding. Dartmouth would probably win that matchup, Betsy Ross’s turnaround jumper notwithstanding.
But Penn will take this game, and the Big Green will go another week in search of that elusive conference win.
Pick: Penn 78, Dartmouth 66
LAST WEEK: 7-1
SEASON: 13-1

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a showdown between cross-town rivals on Thursday night at the Murr Tennis Center, as the Harvard women’s tennis team (1-2) took on Boston College (4-2).
Though the Crimson jumped out to an early lead by taking the doubles competition, the Eagles dominated singles play in Thursday’s matchup. BC took five of the six singles matches against Harvard en route to a 5-2 victory.
The Crimson overcame some early stumbles in the doubles portion of the match. After dropping an early service game, the second court pairing of sophomore Hannah Morrill and freshmen Kelly Whelan fell to the Eagles, 8-6, which forced Harvard to win both the first and third court matches in order to earn the overall doubles point.
Crimson junior Camille Jania and senior Samantha Gridley fell to an early 2-7 deficit against their BC opponents. Jania, who was ill coming into the match, used strong play around the net to win six straight games and earn the victory, 8-7.
"The mindset was really to stay in the point and be aggressive," Gridley said. "You don’t focus on the score of the match. It was really having this diligence that gave us the points we needed to get the win"
Gridley and Jania’s match set the tone for the court one doubles match, putting pressure on the team of co-captains Kristin Norton and Hideko Tachibana to earn the overall doubles point for the Crimson. Coming into the match, the duo boasted an 8-3 record and was ranked 25th in the ITA.
The combination of Norton and Tachibana squared off against the 11th-ranked doubles pairing of Alex Kelleher and Olga Khmylev for the Eagles. BC started off strong by gaining a 4-2 advantage, but the Crimson duo was able claw its way back and overcome early execution errors to force a tiebreaker at eight games apiece. This late-game momentum and high energy allowed them to surge to a 7-3 victory in the tiebreaker and secure one overall point for the Crimson.
But Harvard could not capitalize on this momentum in singles play.
The Eagles’ Kelly Barry beat Crimson freshman Sylvia Li in a 6-2, 6-1 decision to tie the overall match score at one.
Norton was unable to follow up her strong doubles performance, and dropped the first set to BC senior Erina Kikuchi, 3-6. She fell, 0-6, in the second set to put the Crimson into a 2-1 hole.
At this point, Gridley was able to score a victory for Harvard in a heated contest against the Eagles’ hard-hitting Khmylev. Khmylev had frequent altercations with the officials during the match, while Gridley kept her composure to secure victory in the first set. Gridley pressed her advantage using intense play to finish the match as a 7-6, 6-3 victory for the Crimson, tying the overall score at 2.
The match was up for grabs at this point with three singles competitions still to be decided.
"We were trying to go for too much early," Gridley said. "We had to settle down and be more patient."
But things did not go Harvard’s way on the No. 1 singles court. Co-captain Tachibana dropped the first set to her opponent, Jessica Wacnik, in a very close contest, seven games to five. Tachibana showed signs of a comeback when she began the second set with three straight wins, but Wacnik was able to rally off four straight victories in response and win the match, 7-5, 7-6.
Natalie Blosser, who replaced the sick Jania for Harvard, faced off against Kelleher in a do-or-die match for the Crimson. Kelleher took the first set, 6-4, but Blosser was able to assert herself in the second set, winning by a score of 6-3. After three games on serve for each player, Kelleher took control and secured a 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 victory and the overall win for the Eagles.
"I’m very proud of how our team fought today," Harvard coach Traci Green said. "But things just didn’t go our way. We learned a lot about our character. We just need to execute next time, so we know what we need to work on in practice going forward."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PHILADELPHIA, Pa.—On yet another night when the nation was captivated by “Linsanity,” the No. 21/25 Harvard men’s basketball team continued to steamroll toward  one feat Jeremy Lin ’10 never achieved during his time in Cambridge: an Ivy League championship.
Facing a rowdy crowd of nearly 7,500 at a sold-out Palestra, Harvard (21-2, 7-0 Ivy) relied on stingy defense and clutch shooting to emerge with a 56-50 win over Penn (12-11, 4-2) Friday night.
“Penn played extremely well tonight; I’ve got to give them credit,” junior forward Kyle Casey said. “They played great defense, and they threw everything into the game, so I think we really had to grind it out tonight and stick together and really buckle down when we needed to.”
While the team’s veterans kept the squad composed in front of a boisterous student section hungry to witness its second upset of an Ivy League Top 25 team in three years, it was a freshman who stepped up in one of the Crimson’s biggest games of the season to date.
Harvard received an offensive spark off the bench from rookie guard Corbin Miller, who finished 17 points and knocked down three clutch free throws at the end of the game, helped preserve his squad’s undefeated conference record.
“My teammates really did a great job of penetrating and finding me, and I was ready to knock down the shots,” Miller said.
Defensively, the Crimson held the Quakers’ Tyler Bernardini and Zack Rosen—first and third respectively in the Ancient Eight in three-point percentage—to a combined 2-for-11 shooting from long range.
“I think they did a solid job, but we had an opportunity to make plays, and we just didn’t,” Penn coach Jerome Allen said.
Harvard went into the half with a 28-23 lead that was extended to seven when co-captain Oliver McNally drove baseline and hit a layup to start the second half. From there, Penn went on a 7-0 run capped by a three from sophomore guard Miles Cartwright that tied things up at 30 and sent the home fans into a frenzy.
But the Crimson responded with a 7-0 spurt of its own that consisted of a Miller three, a Steve Moundou-Missi reverse layup, and a McNally running floater.
“We certainly answered [Penn’s run] in a strong fashion by responding right away, which I thought was another indication of the leadership and the guts of our team that we’ve shown thus far this season,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.
The Crimson advantage got as large as 10, 44-34, on another Miller three from the right wing at the 6:42 mark in the half. The Quakers cut the deficit to six moments later off a tip-in by forward Henry Brooks, but Casey responded with a turnaround jumper to put Harvard ahead, 49-41.
“The guy who was guarding me [Rob Belcore] was kind of slacking off and really biting on the jabs,” said Casey, who finished with 15. “I tried to be aggressive tonight, but every night with our offense it’s someone different, and it just happened to be me [who had success] tonight.”
By the time Penn was able to get within four at 51-47, there were just 33 seconds left in the game. From there, Miller went to the line and calmly hit two free throws to extend the lead to six.
Rosen hit a desperation three at the other end to make it a one-possession contest, and the Crimson again put the ball in the hands of the rookie. Miller missed the first free throw—bringing the crowd to its most vociferous point—but knocked down the second to ice the win for Harvard. “[He’s an] amazing shooter,” co-captain Keith Wright said. “He gave us a huge lift, especially because I wasn’t scoring a lot. We have guys that can pick other guys up. That’s the scary thing about this team—we’re deep.”
The game was close throughout a back-and-forth first half that was tightly officiated and defensively dominated.
But the Crimson was able to open up a lead as the period wound down. After a Fran Dougherty layup put the Quakers ahead, 17-14, Harvard responded with an 11-0 run highlighted by a Moundou-Missi baseline jumper, a Miller transition three, and a long Casey jumper from the top of the key.
“We’ve talked a lot this season of our bench and our balance being the keys for our ball club,” Amaker said. “[Miller and Moundou-Missi] coming off the bench gave us incredible production.”
Meanwhile, Rosen missed two threes at the other end—he would finish 6-for-21 from the floor on the night—and the Harvard run was not halted until a Marin Kukoc three cut the Penn deficit to 25-20 with 1:52 to go.
Bernardini, the senior who came in averaging over 15 points per game, did not score in the first half and finished with just two points on 0-of-5 shooting from the field. Meanwhile, Wright, Rivard, and Curry—three of Harvard’s top four scorers—were a combined 1 of 15.
“It was one of those games where the shooting wasn’t there for either team,” Amaker said.
Harvard’s win, combined with Yale’s loss to Cornell, gives the Crimson a two-game cushion in its quest for its first outright Ivy championship in team history.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After sophomore outside hitter Nick Madden nearly flew into the stands to preserve a rally that resulted in the Crimson grabbing a one-point lead late in the third set, both the Harvard men’s volleyball team and its fans believed that the Crimson could overcome a two-game deficit and win its conference opener against George Mason.
But Harvard (5-1, 0-1 EIVA) did not capitalize on late opportunities in the decisive third game, and the Patriots left the Malkin Athletic Center on Friday night with a 3-0 win over the previously undefeated Crimson.
Harvard’s offensive rhythm was disrupted all night by the strong service and blocking of George Mason. The Patriots severely limited Crimson outside hitters Madden and co-captain Matt Jones. Jones, who recorded 22 kills with a .500 kill percentage in Harvard’s impressive mid-week win against Cal Baptist, was limited to 11 kills and a .160 kill percentage by George Mason.
“We were just not hitting as high a percentage as we would have liked to,” sophomore libero Chris Gibbons said. “They were getting a lot of blocks, passing well, and getting a lot of digs on our hits. When they’re playing a lot better like that and we’re not stepping up to the call, they are going to win every time.”
Although the game was played on Harvard’s home court, it was the visitors who got off to a hot start behind a boisterous sideline and traveling fan support.  While the Crimson’s pre-game routine was reserved and controlled, the Patriots danced and yelled as the starters were announced.
And seeming to feed off that energy, George Mason stormed out to 7-1 lead behind three kills from junior outside hitter Andrew Dentler, forcing Harvard coach Brian Baise to call a timeout.
“They serve tough and got us out of rhythm,” Baise said. “Our pass was a little off, and then they backed it up with some really good blocking, so it was tough for us to score points.”
The Crimson might have been unnerved by the Patriots’ sideline, which frequently yelled as Harvard players began to serve and did pushups after some George Mason kills.
Harvard refocused out of the timeout, and the Crimson was able to bring itself within one, 14-13. Another Patriot run made it 18-13, but a series of net violations by George Mason kept Harvard in the game.
But the two teams traded points until the end of the first set and the Patriots grabbed the 1-0 lead with 25-21 victory,
The second frame featured the two teams trading points and runs for much of the set. The Crimson maintained a slight lead for much of the set, but the momentum changed as George Mason’s Mark Jones recorded a kill and block to take help the Patriots grab a 19-17 lead.
Baise called a timeout to regroup, but another Dentler-fueled run from the visitors gave them the second game, 25-21.
With its back against the wall, Harvard found itself down 10-6 early in the third set. But the Crimson clawed its way back, and a service ace by freshman Caleb Zimmick brought the game even at 18-18.
From that point forward, the teams went back and forth, as both sidelines started to make their voices heard.
Kills from Jones and sophomore Will Chambers gave Harvard narrow advantages, but George Mason was there to respond with a kill of its own.
And after a deflected block sent the ball towards the stands, Madden saved the point by sending it to freshman DJ White, who knocked the ball over the net. Moments later the Crimson gained a narrow 22-21 lead as Jones’s spike went out of bounds.
But George Mason responded with a short run to grab match point, 24-23, causing Baise to call another timeout.
And after a kill by White tied it up at 24, George Mason called a timeout of its own, its first of the game. It proved to be a prudent move, as the Patriots scored two straight to take the match without dropping a set.
“We had some opportunities in the third game that we didn’t take advantage of and had to at this point in the season,” Baise said. “If we get a win in that third game, it’s a completely different match…but we couldn’t quite do it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team seemed to have found its groove.
After a first half of the season characterized by a program-record number of ties, the Crimson held a 2-1 lead going in to the game’s final minute against Rensselaer. And though it was far from the team’s best performance, Harvard was on the verge of winning its third league game in four tries.
But the visiting Engineers played spoilers, scoring what would be the game’s last goal with 63 seconds left on the clock to force the 2-2 overtime tie Friday night at the Bright Hockey Center.
“We got pretty much what we deserved,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “With a little over a minute left, we had the puck and full control. We end up icing the puck, and [it’s] just indicative of what we saw all night. Not a lot of poise with the puck and not great execution.”
With the draw, Harvard’s 10th, the Crimson (7-7-10, 6-4-8 ECAC) broke the conference record and tied the NCAA record for ties in single season.
By earning only one point on the night, Harvard fell to fourth place in the ECAC standings, now one point ahead of fifth-place Clarkson.  Because only the top four teams in the conference earn a bye in the first round of next month’s ECAC playoffs, a failure to pick up two points against Rensselaer (7-19-3, 4-10-3), the league’s lowest-ranked team, may prove to be an important misstep for the Crimson.
“I know they’re lowest ranked right now...but they really brought the fight,” sophomore goaltender Raphael Girard said. “They’re not a really skilled team—there’s one, two guys who can shoot the puck on their team—but they really worked hard, and that paid off for them in the end.”
Junior forwards Alex Fallstrom and Luke Grenier, whose score midway through the third period gave Harvard the lead, each scored once on the night.
Unlike in games past, Girard started for the Crimson in net, saving 27 of the 29 shots that came his way. For most of the season, Girard had watched the action from the bench while freshman Steve Michalek tended the Crimson’s net. But the rookie had been pulled in favor of Girard in both of the two previous contests, and so on Friday, it was Girard who got the start.
“[Girard] has played well in his two relief appearances,” Donato said. “Raph’s worked hard, he earned the start tonight, and I thought he played well.”
Harvard looked poised to grab the lead early, as the team had two legitimate goal chances in the first two minutes while Rensselaer managed just one shot in the opening six minutes. The Engineers offense began to heat up later in the period, tallying four shots in the ensuing 2:35 and eventually scoring the game’s first goal.
Rensselaer defenseman Nick Bailen fired a shot from the right point, which Crimson freshman defenseman Max Everson blocked. But two Engineers forwards pushed the puck over to teammate C.J. Lee, who beat Girard glove side to give the visitors the 1-0 lead.
It didn’t take the long for the Harvard offense, which had been largely stagnant since the early goings, to answer.
Less than two minutes later, junior forward Marshall Everson found Fallstrom just outside the crease. Fallstrom knocked it past Rensselaer goaltender Bryce Merriam to even the score at one.
“It was kind of a broken play,” Fallstrom said. “Max [Everson] shot [the puck], and it went down into the corner, and Marshall made a really nice [pass]…. It was just hanging out there in front of net, and all I had to do was put it in.”
Neither squad could break the draw during the second period, though Rensselaer nearly grabbed the lead on a number of occasions. Twice, Girard was sorely out of position, giving the Engineers a large area of goal to work with. But both times, the visitors could not capitalize, and the score remained tied going into the game’s final frame.
Ten minutes into the third period, Harvard, whose third-period theatrics have lifted the team a number of times this season, came through again.  In a two-on-one, senior forward Eric Kroshus skated down the left side of the ice before finding Grenier in the slot, and the junior drilled his seventh of the year to give the home team the 2-1 edge.
The Crimson failed to execute on a power-play opportunity later in the period and widen the lead. Harvard went zero for two on the man advantage for the night.
That missed opportunity came back to bite the home team. With just over a minute remaining, Engineers forward Brock Higgs sent the game into overtime with his equalizer.
“I’m kind of pissed because I wish I could have closed that game [and] just [brought] that win home,” Girard said.
Neither team could break the tie in the five-minute overtime period.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Brogan Berry ran the show Friday night at Lavietes Pavilion. Leading the Harvard women’s basketball team to a 66-52 win over Penn, the senior captain netted a season-high 26 points while shutting down the Quakers’ leading scorer. In the second half, Berry scored half of her team’s points. And she did it all with a wrap protecting her sprained thumb.
“I came into the weekend trying to get back to the way I usually play with a lot of confidence,” Berry said. “I usually don’t have the scoring mentality, but going into the second half of the Ivy my senior year, I’m not ready to lose, so whatever it takes I’ll do to win.”
Eighteen seconds into the game, Berry made her presence felt by knocking down a jumper. After being held to five points against Columbia and single digits in three of the Crimson’s last five games, she was due for an outburst.
Early on, her Harvard team (12-8, 5-1 Ivy) battled Penn (8-12, 1-5) and controlled a single digit lead. The home team opened up a 15-6 lead early but a bevy of deep threes and midrange jumpers by Quakers fueled an 11-2 run that ended with the match tied at 17. The Crimson would regain the lead soon after held it for the rest of the half.
On the final possession of the frame, Penn sophomore Alyssa Baron knocked down a contested three-pointer as the buzzer sounded to pull the Quakers within a single point, 30-29. Baron was pivotal for the Penn offense early, as she tallied 18 points in the first half alone thanks to four treys and a couple of deep two-point jump shots.
“Our defense was terrible on [Baron],” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “We played off of her. That was just not what they were told to do.”
“We knew Baron was a good player and for her to have 20 points in the first half was a huge disappointment for our entire team,” Berry said. “It was a wakeup call, and we really adjusted in the second half.”
To begin the game, sophomore Christine Clark was tasked with stopping the Quaker sharpshooter. But after Baron dazzled in the first half and Clark was sidelined with two fouls, Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith switched up the defensive assignments and entrusted Berry with slowing down Baron.
Berry was up to the challenge. In the second half, Baron was zero for five with zero points.
“I come from a very defensive background, so I take a lot of pride in holding the other team down,” Berry said. “The only way they were going to win was if [Baron] had a great second half, so I kept her out of the play as much as possible.”
At the same time Berry was locking down Baron, she was leading her team on the offensive end of the court. She had 11 points in the first 6:16 of the second half and 18 points overall in the period.
The Penn players not named Baron stepped up to match Berry’s production in the opening minutes of the second period, as the teams went back and forth until Harvard took a 42-41 lead when Miriam Rutzen converted an and-one opportunity. After grabbing that slight advantage, the Crimson extended its lead to 52-43 thanks to a balanced attack led by the shooting and passing of Berry.
Then both offenses slowed as neither team could register a score for over three minutes, but none other than Berry broke Harvard’s cold spell with a jumper with eight minutes left. During the remainder of the game, the senior knocked down a big three and two clutch free throws to seal the 66-52 victory.
“We got the stops about halfway through the second half when we needed to,” Berry said. “It just took that little bit of defensive effort to get us going and not looking back.”
As a result of her dominant performance, Berry moved into sixth place in points in Crimson history with 1,326. She wasn’t the only one to set records Friday. Junior Victoria Lippert notched her 1,000 point early in the game, becoming the sixth player to reach the mark before her senior campaign.
Junior Emma Golen recorded career-highs in points and assists with 13 and four, respectively. As a whole, Harvard recorded its 300th Ivy league victory, becoming only the second team in the conference to achieve the milestone.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 8 Harvard women’s hockey team (17-8-1, 14-4-1 ECAC) defeated Rensselaer (8-19-2, 5-12-4) on Friday by a score of 4-2 at the Houston Field House in Troy, N.Y.
Sophomore Marissa Gedman led the charge for the Crimson by scoring two power-play goals in the second period and gave Harvard a demanding 3-0 lead, which proved too difficult for the Engineers to overcome.
With the win the Crimson continue to position itself for home ice for the first round of the ECAC tournament.
Harvard freshman Samantha Reber started off the scoring for the Crimson with a score off an assist from junior forward Jillian Dempsey a little over five minutes into the game.
After Gedman added her two goals in the second, sophomore Lyndsey Fry stretched the lead to 4-0 in the third when she put a shot past Rensselaer goalie Kelly O’Brien.
The Engineers' senior Laura Guillemette and junior Taylor Horton pulled Rensselaer within two with a little under nine minutes remaining, but the comeback proved to be too little too late as Harvard went on for the 4-2 victory.
The Crimson will look to carry the momentum from the win into Saturday’s matchup versus Union.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s squash team swept No. 10 Brown (9-7, 1-5 Ivy), 9-0, Friday night, submitting a strong performance ahead of Sunday’s matchup with No. 2 Yale. With the victory, the No. 1 Crimson (13-0, 6-0 Ivy) preserved its unbeaten season and its top ranking, which it has held all year.
In what was largely a tune-up for Sunday’s showdown, Harvard’s top nine did not drop a single game, completing a perfect regular season campaign at home.
The Crimson was keyed by freshman Amanda Sobhy, who earned a win at the No. 1 spot with a 3-0 rout of her opponent, the Bears’ Dori Rahbar, losing only three points in the process.
At the No. 2 position, junior Laura Gemmell won in similar fashion, defeating Brown’s Sarah Domenick, 11-0, 11-0, 11-5.
Co-captain and No. 3 Nirasha Guruge had a slightly more difficult time in dispatching her opponent, Brown No. 3 Sarah Crosky, but she ultimately prevailed in three games, 11-3, 11-5, 11-8.
Guruge said she found the contest more challenging psychologically than physically due to the presumed gap in talent between her and Crosky.
“I find these matches tougher,” Guruge said. “Everyone expects you to win easily, so I put more pressure on myself. Obviously, you have to do your best and respect your opponent always.”
With wins at No. 6 and No. 8, respectively, junior Sarah Mumanachit and freshman Megan Murray joined Sobhy and Gemmell in continuing their undefeated individual seasons.
Mumanachit defeated Brown’s Lydia Smith, 11-3, 12-10, 11-3, and Murray likewise cruised in straight sets, taking down Sarah Beresford of Brown, 11-5, 11-5, 11-4.
The win extended Harvard’s dominance of the Ivy League, giving the team its third straight sweep of an Ancient Eight opponent.
But the memory of a scare in Ivy League play earlier in the season forced the Crimson to focus against Brown, despite being heavy favorites.
“Princeton scared the crap out of us,” Harvard coach Mike Way said. “We dodged a bullet there and squeaked out that win [5-4, on Feb. 5]. So this was business. Let’s get the job done.”
But although he expected his team to win handily, Way saw no need for fiery motivational tactics; he let his team’s play do the talking.
“The coach’s job is to get [the players’] heads in the right space,” Way said. “They know the game plan; the girls know it’s there.”
The lopsided result reflected the nature of the two teams’ matchups throughout history. Harvard’s win improved its record against Brown to a perfect 43-0, including 22 shutouts.
The team’s perfect home record will be put to the test just one more time, when the Murr Center plays host to the CSA Team Championships from Feb. 24 to 26.

If you've ever been kicked out of Lamont Library at 10 p.m. on a Friday night, a survey conducted by the UC Student Life Committee may be the answer to your library woes. The survey, which has already received 1,500 responses, asks for student input on whether undergraduates would utilize Lamont Library were it to extend its hours.
The survey, which takes just a few minutes to complete, looks at the possibility of extending Lamont hours on Friday and Saturday consistently thoughout the semester as well as extending the weekend hours during Reading Period and Finals Period.
Before issuing the survey, the UC worked closely with Harvard University Library Executive Director Helen Shenton to determine the types of questions that should be asked as well as the possibility of implementing these changes depending on student responses.
UC Student Life Committee Chair Christopher A. Devine '13 said that while there are no steadfast guarantees, working with the administration closely on this means that student responses will have a significant impact on any future changes to library hours.
"I think it'll be really interesting to see what the responses are," Devine said.
So, if you have an opinion either way or just want to fill out the survey to win one of five $10 Pinkberry or Berryline gift cards, go ahead and click on the link.

Schoolwork got you down? Join the club. All cheap jokes aside, it's probably better to put this week's reading or p-set aside for a while and give yourself some time to pursue a little happiness.
Harvard's own HappyNest, part of the student effort known as The Happiness Project, is endorsing its "Semester Happiness Challenge," a project catering to the not-so-rare stressed-out Harvard student.
Leslie R. Rith-Najarian '12 developed this initiative and, along with Evá M. Williams '13, crafted a series of challenges designed to promote student wellness. Through an email list, participants will be reminded of weekly challenges like listening to new music every day or coming up with daily haikus. Members can also use the email list to discuss the weekly challenge or exchange stories, fostering a sense of community.
"There has been psychological research showing how social support can help increase motivation for behavior changes," Rith-Najarian wrote in an email. Inspired by last spring's Currier Vegan Challenge, she designed a "Weekly Challenge Group" in Currier, where students changed their lifestyles for a short yet significant period of time. This semester, Rith-Najarian wanted to broaden the project's scope and turn it into an inclusive wellbeing challenge for the entire campus. "Fifty people have already signed up in the first night," Rith-Najarian said.
But wait, there's more! Awesome prizes will be given out at the end of the semester for finishing challenges. Think of this as productive procrastination at its finest.
If you're interested, sign up by midnight on Feb. 12!

Feb. 7, 1912: The Dickens Centennial
 
An unusual interest attaches to Professor Copeland's reading in the Union this evening. It may be called Harvard's only recognition of the one hundredth anniversary of the birth of Charles Dickens, with whose amiable characters nearly all of us are familiar. In New York a committee of which T. Roosevelt '80 is chairman, last night gave a banquet at which the best known writers of the country paid tribute to the author of "Pickwick". This evening the same committee will organize a mass meeting where Dr. Van Dyke, H. W. Mabie, and William Watson, of London, will speak. Were it not for Professor Copeland, it is doubtful if any of us would take an interest in Dickens today other than to hear that William Watson, of London, read an original poem in commemoration of the anniversary "before a large and cultured audience."
To those who recently heard Professor Bliss Perry's brilliant lecture on "Dickens", in Comparative Literature 12, or to those who are already familiar with the inimitable Dick Swiveller, the Artful Dodger, Mr. Pecksniff, with his air of injured innocence, Miss Sarah Gamp or her omnipresent friend Mrs. Harris, little urging to hear Professor Copeland need be given. To those unacquainted with some of the most familiar and lovable characters in fiction, the reading this evening offers a rare opportunity in this land of plenty.
Feb. 9, 1959: ROTC Instructor Welcomes 'Cliffie As First Girl To Enroll in Course
"This is Military Sciences 1b," the Colonel began. ROTC members had filed in with amazing regularity for a 9 o'clock class. "Promptness is the courtesy of kings," the colonel said. "I guess I'll have to get up ten minutes earlier," the Cliffie thought. The walk from the Radcliffe dorms to Shannon Hall is a long one.
"You are the first young lady to come to this class in all the years I've been teaching it," the colonel went on. "Are you thinking of auditing this course?" "I'd like to take it, sir," she answered. The colonel laughed. "You're welcome." Before the experiment, skeptics had warned she'd be thrown out on her curls.
"Open to non-ROTC students with permission of the instructor," the course catalogue said. There was no gender qualification. The instructor seemed willing to give his permission.
Feb. 8, 1978: Students Celebrate College Shutdown
While firemen, public works employees, policemen and National Guardsmen battled one of the worst snowstorms in New England history, a party atmosphere reigned in Harvard Square as a multitude of students and Cambridge residents enjoyed the winter wonderland.
"Thank God for acts of God," said Nicholas H. Vanderbilt '80. "But I'm not looking forward to digging my car out."
Many students delighted in the sense of anarchy that prevailed yesterday, although some felt let down by Harvard's failure to overcome the forces of nature.

With less than a week until Valentine's Day, many of you are probably putting the finishing touches on your oh-so-perfect plans for the day. Flowers in her dropbox? Check. A serenade delivered by the Kroks to his classroom? Check. Candlelight dinner atop of Memorial Church? Okay, maybe that's taking it too far.
More likely, all the talk about fancy dinners and dates is burning a hole through your already empty wallet. Well, you're in luck.
The UC's Student Initiatives Committee is launching "I See Love," a special opportunity through which hopeful romantics can apply for Valentine's Day grants. All you have to do is submit a detailed proposal and itemized budget of your plans to be considered.
