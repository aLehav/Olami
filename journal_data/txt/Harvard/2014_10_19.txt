After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every once in a while, books exec Grace E. Huckins ’16 is sent a novel so bizarre and counterfactual that the only place it can possibly belong is in the Arts Blog. Here, we examine the king of these strange books, Yippie gadfly A.J. Weberman’s 2009 masterpiece “RightWing Bob.”
Ted Nugent, Kid Rock, Lynyrd Skynyrd—outside of these colorful examples, conservative rock stars are few and far in between. However, according to “RightWing Bob,” there are more Republican rapscallions lurking under the surface of the rock establishment.
In this 666-page tome, Weberman exposes “what the liberal media doesn’t want you to know about Bob Dylan”—that he’s a right-wing extremist. According to Weberman, Dylan has hidden messages in all of his songs that show his true, extremely reactionary feelings on issues from civil rights to communism to the Israel-Palestine conflict. For fans of those YouTube videos where they play Beyoncé songs backwards and explain the Illuminati references (hint: when it doesn’t sound like words, it’s “demonic chanting”) this is a great read.
Weberman declares himself the “world’s only living Dylanologist.” Where did he acquire this encyclopaedic knowledge? His introductory chapter, “My Unique Credentials as a Dylanologist,”  is littered with name-drops of infamous celebrities he was remotely associated with and stories of every drug he’s ever done. Weberman explains how, starting in the 1970s, he looked through Dylan’s garbage and argues that he was the first “muckraking journalist” to use this “method of investigation.” However, this groundbreaking technique is nothing without Weberman’s poetic analysis.
Weberman assigns chapters for more than 200 of Dylan’s most famous songs and provides line-by-line evidence of the artist’s arch-conservatism. Here are some of the author’s choicest breakdowns:
-”How many years can a mountain exist” (Blowing in the Wind)
What Weberman thinks Dylan means: “How much longer can the mountainous problem of the Negro [sic] be allowed to exist?”
-”She’s an artist, she don’t look back” (She Belongs to Me)
What Weberman thinks Dylan means: “She has no regrets about what happened to artists during the McCarthy era.”
-”May you build a ladder to the stars” (Forever Young)
What Weberman thinks Dylan means: “May you create a part of the American economy where you are free to reach for the stars.”
-”You must leave now” (It’s All Over Now Baby Blue)
What Weberman thinks Dylan means: “Fidel Castro and Soviet communism must leave Cuba now.”
Thanks for clearing up these ambiguous meanings, A.J.!
Weberman’s own beliefs are one of the most intriguing things about the book. Though he is determined to convince us that Bob Dylan was ideologically on the far Right, he seems to be a leftist with regards to social programs and drug legalization. However, he doesn’t mind filling his translations with racist tirades or adding tidbits like “Dylan was having sexual relations with more sexual partners than a Muslim would have if he reached heaven.” Weberman comes off an awful lot like the Dylan he criticizes. Despite all the hate, he claims that he and Dylan were friends and that “the Dylan-Weberman...relationship is the legend that poems are made of,” even noting that in a phone conversation “Dylan said he was going to write a poem about me entitled ‘Pig.’ That may not seem like the most positive title, but you just don’t understand the beauty of a friendship based around digging in someone’s trash.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Third down was not the charm for the Harvard football team on Saturday.
The Crimson (5-0, 2-0 Ivy) had to rely on record-setting plays and good field position to remain undefeated, as it converted just three of its 16 attempts on third down en route to a 24-14 win over Lafayette (3-4, 1-1 Patriot) at Harvard Stadium.
“The kids hung in there, we found a way to win,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. ”We have so many areas we can improve. The only thing we're completely happy with is the intangibles, the effort, the attitude, the grit...find[ing] the way to win.”
One of those successful third-down attempts came on a third-and-20 midway through the second quarter, when Harvard was backed up to its own 22-yard line. Junior quarterback Scotty Hosch found junior wideout Andrew Fischer on a quick screen, and Fischer, behind two blocks by tight ends, blew past the Lafayette defense to run 78 yards down the left sideline for the score.
Fischer’s touchdown was Harvard’s first of the game and gave the Crimson a 10-0 lead.
Another third down that saw Harvard move the chains was on a drive at the end of the half that led to junior running back Paul Stanton’s 43-yard breakout run to score, tying his longest of the season.
The Crimson failed to convert on any third downs outside of the second quarter, when it scored 14 points, and relied on two fourth-down conversions to keep its field-goal scoring drive alive.
“We’ve been fortunate the last couple of games on fourth down on those calls,” Murphy said. “The bottom line is [that] we’d like to be a team that doesn’t have to go for it on fourth down very often and just do a better job on third down.”
Lafayette didn’t have much more luck on third down—the Leopards moved the chains on just five of 17 third downs.
IN THE RED
Despite putting up 440 offensive yards to Harvard’s 367 and making it to the red zone three times, Lafayette’s offensive unit only put up points on one opportunity.
After captain defensive back Norman Hayes brought down Leopards tailback Ross Scheuerman in the backfield to set up a third and long, kicker Ryan Gralish missed a field goal attempt from 41 yards to keep Lafayette scoreless heading into the break.
The Leopards’ best opportunity to score came late in the third quarter, when backup quarterback Blake Searfoss led the squad 78 yards down the field. Then the Harvard defense cracked down. A pitch to Scheuerman resulted in a loss of yardage, and an attempted touchdown pass to wideout Matt Mrazek was tipped by junior linebacker Scott Peters to fall incomplete. Lafayette elected to attempt a 26-yard field goal, but this kick soared wide right as well.
“The coaches had us exactly prepared for what they like to do in the red zone, especially on third down,” Peters said. “Just overall, [assistant] coach [Scott] Larkee designed some really good schemes for us down there, and it’s working out so far in the season.”
The Leopards’ lone touchdown before the fourth quarter came off a pick-six, when corner Phillip Parnam jumped Fischer’s route to intercept Hosch.
NOTHING FISCHY
With senior wide receiver Seitu Smith out for the game, Fischer picked up the slack. The junior was Hosch’s favorite target of the day, catching six passes for 107 yards, including the long score that made it into the record books as the eighth-longest passing score in Harvard history.
“We pride ourselves a lot on stepping up when people go down,” Fischer said. “I took it upon myself to execute as well as I could and perform as well as I could.”
Fischer also became the team’s go-to kick and punt returner, a role normally shared with Smith. On the kicks that he returned, Fischer averaged over 40 yards to put Harvard in prime field position for scoring. The wideout also recorded 19 yards on four carries.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend’s Head of the Charles Regatta proved that it’s not always about how you start, but about how you finish.
Despite struggling at the start of the races, many boats from the Harvard men’s crew teams were able to improve throughout their races to end strong. No crew tallied an outright race victory, but Crimson entries earned top three finishes in the main races for heavyweight and lightweight eights.
HEAVYWEIGHT
While the Harvard heavyweight 1V may have had technical difficulties beginning its race, finishing was a different story.
Despite an early mix-up that caused the Crimson’s first eight to start, stop, and start again, Harvard’s premier heavyweight boat maintained a consistent clip to a top three finish in the men’s championship eights. The Crimson, which was the fastest college boat, earned third place for the second consecutive year with a time of 14:29.66 over the roughly three-mile long course.
The only boats to row faster than Harvard were manned by veteran post-collegiate crews known as “Great Eights.” Of the sixteen rowers that composed these Great Eights, fifteen had Olympic experience.
“We were in the thick of some really fast crews, so we knew we were going to be working off of them,” senior coxswain Jack Smith said. “It meant that we had a really good measuring stick, a litmus test with which to gauge ourselves. That was a good way to keep us motivated.”
But early in the race, international crews threatened to pull away from the Crimson boat, which was stroked by senior Charles Risbey. In particular, the French national boat, which started after Harvard, began to crowd the Crimson from behind.
“We held our ground,” sophomore four-seat Ross Jarvis said. “We sort of stuck to our guns, stayed at a constant speed, and pulled away towards the end. Our [coxswain] did a good line.”
Craftsbury, the boat that won, pulled rowers from eight different countries, including the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Croatia, and the U.S. This international crew finished 3.36 seconds ahead of Taurus, the other Great Eight boat which sat former Harvard oarsman Henrik Rummel ’09 in the three seat, and 9.43 seconds ahead of Harvard. The second varsity in the heavyweight championship eights finished 29th out of a field of 36.
In the men’s club eights, two freshman boats rowed to third and eighth place in a crowded field of 47 boats. The third-place boat rowed evenly throughout the race and ended 13.14 seconds behind Northeastern, which won the event by edging out Brown.
In an equally large field of 52 boats, the Crimson heavyweight four rowed to a 33rd-place finish.
LIGHTWEIGHT
For the second straight Head of the Charles, Harvard placed second in the men’s lightweight eights. Although the Crimson started slowly, the first varsity picked up the pace in the final half of the race to end two seconds behind Princeton.
At the first official time check of the race at Riverside Boat Club, 10 of the 17 boats were within four seconds of Harvard. However, increased speed widened this margin until every crew besides Princeton and Cornell had dropped back at least seven seconds by Weld Boathouse.
Despite a second-place finish in a talented field of 17, half the oarsmen, such as sophomore stroke Emanuel Ritschard and coxswain James Dreben, are in just their second season of collegiate competition. Of the eight athletes in the 1V boat, only one, five-seat Michael Wales, is a senior.
The second varsity in the lightweight race experienced early difficulties. Sidetracked by the slowest start of any lightweight crew, the Crimson’s 2V had to make up time from the beginning and finished in 14th place.
Fourteenth place had a very different meaning to Harvard’s lone lightweight entry in the men’s club four. In a mixed-weight field of 52, the boat’s 17:25.15 performance placed the Crimson near the front of the pack, nearly 20 spots ahead of the Harvard heavyweight quartet.
Harvard’s most impressive result of the two-day event was not recorded by a current student. In the championship singles, former Harvard lightweight rower Andrew Campbell ’14 pulled away from Kjetil Borch, the two-time defending champion, and Mahe Drysdale, the current Olympic gold medalist, to claim first with a course record time of 17:11.64.
Campbell, who won by more than nine seconds, rowed with the Crimson for three years as an undergraduate and currently trains with Cambridge Boat Club.

Because we all miss those Seventeen Magazine quizzes.
The Ranger: Since HUDS has been known to write “Ranger cookie” when describing what the “Ranger cookie” is made of, choosing this risky flavor means you’re not afraid of the unknown, and are also not irritated by the occasional vague description. The Ranger cookie’s oatmeal gives it a chewier taste than the others and reflects your resilient, rugged nature.
Oatmeal Raisin: You are easily confused and pick up cookies too quickly before you realize that the raisins are not chocolate. Although your fast-paced nature and efficiency is applauded, taking the time to observe the nature of the dark objects in your food may serve you well in the future. If you legitimately and knowingly choose to eat the raisins, you are good at dealing with disappointment and/ or have a tremendously positive attitude that allows you to look at the glass completely full when it is in fact, full of raisins.
Chocolate Chip: You are a classic, quintessential human being who appreciates simple comforts. Although this cookie may not taste quite like your parents make them back home, you’ve got a streak of nostalgia in you that appreciates what you can understand. You are a person who seeks stability, and who is able to move beyond the mistakes your oatmeal raisin peers have made. Or you just know a decent cookie when you see one.
Carnival Cookie: With six different kinds of food coloring on its M&M shell, this is a cookie that screams “fun.”  You’re the kind of person who rewards yourself in the middle of the week (since this cookie is traditionally served on Wednesdays) just ‘cause, someone who looks at each day as a sort of celebration, and who loves sugar and is not afraid to consume it by the pound.
Sugar Cookie: You appreciate everything classic and uncomplicated, but you are pretty unlikely to take risks, and rather just enjoy the simple things in life. You're almost like your chocolate chip loving friends, but less likely to drink on a Thursday night.
Double Chocolate Chip: You have good taste. Informal and not wholly accurate surveys throughout Annenberg have proven that this is the best cookie, and your choice showcases your refined palate. It is probably part of the reason you are here today, able to enjoy this end-of-the-week treat with the full knowledge that you have earned it. You’re the kid who spent your last summer before freshman fall meeting the Dalai Lama, advising President Obama, and teaching algebra to children in Bangladesh. You were the one who brought a finished résumé to student activities fair. You’ve even figured out how to do all of the Gov 20 readings before they are due—you’ve really got your act together.
None: You exercise a lot of self-control or believe you are too good for Annenberg cookies and have your cookies shipped exclusively from Insomnia. For the former, your will to avoid the freshman fifteen is admirable and rare, and showcases all that is unique about your willpower and determination. Pro-tip for the Insomnia junkies: microwaving the double chocolate chip in this dining hall saves you $1.50 and will leave you almost as satisfied.
