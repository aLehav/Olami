Travelling along the highway is a funny thing. At its best, the road can be a place for self-discovery and dreaming. As the black tar and white lines replay over and over before you it is easy to get lost in thought. I think about that guy I never had the guts to talk to this past year at school, the paper I should have written, or the club I should have joined. I think about my Grandma and wonder what she thinks of it all.
Sometimes the motion of the road breeds joy; sometimes it brings pain and bad memories. But no matter what, it simply goes on and on until you reach your destination. The road spares all judgment and allows us the freedom to be human: It gives us space to make our own choices.
Occasionally, the self-reflection is snapped without warning by the harsh hand of a startling billboard or sign. Signs along our highways in America, especially in the South, can sometimes be provocative or rude or even hateful.
I saw one such sign traveling through Louisiana the other day on the way to New Orleans to open for Allen Stone on his Radius tour. The sign stated in bold letters: “Go to church or the Devil will get you.”
Such a message outrages and saddens me. Not because I don’t believe or value the Church, but rather because I do. It outrages me because no message could be farther from what Jesus actually taught in his life on earth. It saddens me, because this sign is only one stone in a heap of others promoting bigotry, hatred, and arrogance within modern Christianity.
As a Christian, I have two things to say to the Church at large. My first statement is very simple: Stop. Please stop it. Stop the arguing, fighting, and anger. Stop what you are doing and rethink what you are called to believe. Throughout history and into modern times, those who claim to be Christian have far too often hurt so many people both outside and inside its walls—this pain and enmity is directly counter to the true mission of the Church.
Secondly, we need to go back and read what Jesus actually said and did. Jesus did not exhort his followers to hate and condemn others; instead, Jesus preached a message of love. Jesus never told anyone to go to church to avert the flames of hell. In his sermons, Jesus spoke no threats, but only words of love, especially to those who are downtrodden, struggling, and suffering. For his supposed followers to put out a statement such as the one I saw on the road is utterly contrary to anything Jesus would have said or done. Not only is it inconsistent from a historical perspective and untrue from a theological standpoint, it is deeply offensive to the human spirit.
If the creator of that billboard had meant, “Go to church and only then will you be perfect and God will love you and give you a good life”, I must entirely and passionately disagree. I’ve been going to Church my whole life and I’m certainly not perfect. In fact, going to Church has only shown me how much more I still need to grow as a human, how much more I should love others, how flawed I really am. And it didn’t suddenly make me a good person, but it did provide me with a loving community where I could expose my true self and grow. That is what Jesus intended for the Church.
And if the creator of that billboard wanted to condemn all sinners, I must still disagree, for Jesus always welcomed and loved those who were viewed as sinners. Prostitutes, tax collectors, liars, cheaters, and gluttons—in short, people like me. According to the Gospels, he associated himself so much with these people that he was viewed as a drunkard and a glutton. From my reading of the Gospels, this fallen community of people was the Church.
The only people Jesus ever called out or spoke aggressively to were the religious elite of his day; he called them a “brood of vipers” because they were condemning, hateful, and exclusive to those they deemed sinners. In a modern context, the only people who mirror these Pharisees are those who share the same mindset as the creators of these hurtful billboards. They find pride in their religiosity, and feel the need to strictly enforce it and all its rules upon others. From what we can see of Jesus’ life and message, this is not at all how he would have wanted the leaders of his Church to conduct themselves.
To be fair, I think this billboard represents a very small, albeit loud, voice within Christendom. And too often, the volume of these outrageous people and their outrageous beliefs are drowning out the good in the modern Church.
But there is hope. This past Sunday, I stumbled upon a church, called “The Little Church by the Sea.” It was quietly tucked behind a Hindu temple on Legion Street in a Southern Californian town. The pastor said something remarkably refreshing as he addressed the recent Supreme Court decision: “When we come here and share in the table of love, the world will see and want some.”
His words struck a chord in me. Because no matter how hard we try to deny it, the human heart is aquiver with the hope of finding real love. And so the Church, which is supposed to proclaim a message of love from Jesus, should never feel the need to impose churchgoing, or force Christianity on anyone. It should just love. And those who feel drawn towards it will come.
When love, as described and exhibited by Jesus, is the reality and focus of the modern Church, the hate-filled billboards will be no longer be noticed along the road.

To the Editor:
The July 7, 2015 article "A $400 Million Gift and Accompanying Criticism" describes controversy around John Paulson’s record gift to the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. The root of much criticism is a sense that the gift is unjust—one university president called it "obscene"—and that Harvard doesn’t need the gift as it is already wealthy. Some defend the gift by arguing that the SEAS needs the money relative to other schools in the university, or to keep pace with other engineering schools.
I’d like to offer a different way to think about it—that Harvard has no needs, and that’s precisely why the gift is so powerful.
Jim Lord, a development professional who has many good insights on the field, likes to say organizations have no needs. Communities, societies, and individuals, of course, have needs to satisfy and problems to solve. Not so for organizations. They have solutions. They have answers. They have capabilities. But they do not have needs.
So instead of “Does Harvard need this money?” or “Does SEAS need this money?” the question becomes, “What can Harvard and SEAS do with this money?” That may strike the critic as a trivial distinction at first, but it’s actually profound.
Following Jim Lord’s advice, we could make the case for Paulson’s investment (and all philanthropic investment) this way: At Harvard we think differently about attracting philanthropic support. We approach our donors with a simple fact: Harvard has no needs. That is why we are so successful—we work with donors to focus on and solve the great problems that we face.
President Faust’s engagement with students on fossil fuels takes a capabilities approach when she argues that Harvard’s impact comes most effectively through research and innovation.
I think that is part of why the Chan family gift to the School of Public Health was well received was because—as the article mentions—the gift’s purposes were described with some specificity and so the image conveyed was that it would generate social return on investment.
The same is true of course for SEAS. Many of the greatest opportunities to improve human wellbeing and the wellbeing of the environment can and are being pursued by work at the school, and may only come from an institution like SEAS. On the other hand, there are services different schools or non-profit organizations can perform better than Harvard, and in those cases a gift may have a higher return there. In both cases it is a focus on the capabilities of a school or non-profit organization, not its needs, which get us to the transformative potential.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BAKERSFIELD, Calif.—On a dryly hot Sunday evening this month, my childlike love of live baseball leads me here, to an outpost in the California desert not quite like any place I’ve seen before.
Sam Lynn Ballpark is the home of the Bakersfield Blaze and the site of my fourth baseball game of July 4th weekend. It’s the first Independence Day I’ve spent away from home, and after an oddly difficult bout of homesickness on Thursday, baseball is how I’m coping. My first three games of the weekend were at Dodger Stadium, where I saw my beloved Mets take two of three from the hometown Dodgers. Tonight, after two frightening hours in my rented “Smart Car,” (quotes because I feel like I made a dumb choice) I’m more than 100 miles away from my temporary bedroom in somebody else’s condo on the West Side of L.A.
The Blaze are the Class A affiliate of the Seattle Mariners, but judged on raw appearance Sam Lynn doesn’t come close to living up to what you would expect from a professional team. For starters, parking is free, a first in my experience attending professional games. More noticeable are the park’s dimensions—at 354 feet to dead center, it’s the shallowest field in professional baseball—and that, of the 40 or so people in attendance tonight (the park is said to hold 3,500, but I’m told that number isn’t hit often), about half appear to be team employees. Another Class A game I attend the next week at a different stadium has about as many people waiting in line for tickets five minutes before the game.
I sit behind home plate ($11) with six diehard Blaze fans. Each takes his or her turn reeling off the names of Major League players who have come through the friendly confines of Sam Lynn, and we all join the fun of heckling the poor umpire who stands less than ten feet away from us. But despite the enthusiasm, signs that this place is small time abound: when I ask the gentleman to my left who Bakersfield’s best player is, he answers with a Russian name, and soon I realize he’s talking about a goalie on the local minor league hockey team. In July. At a baseball game. 
Nevertheless, the Blaze pour it on early, knocking around Stockton Ports starter Dylan Covey for five runs while holding the Ports to just one courtesy of Brett Ash’s 95 m.p.h. fastball (I’m betting he gets his shot at Double A ball soon). Out of habit I manually score the game, but my attention soon drifts away from the baseball to the players themselves. Everyone on the field was a star in high school or college ball and many were taken in the first 10 rounds of the professional draft, yet the woman next to me says that the Cal Ripken League game next door for players in their early teens probably has a bigger crowd. I can’t tell if she’s joking.
I’ve been to a lot of baseball fields, and I have a weakness for leaning on them when I want to write something emotional and “honest”. While I’m used to the Spartan charm most minor league parks offer, I’ve never seen a place like Sam Lynn, which strips away almost everything that’s sexy about being a professional athlete. The no-frills ballfield accentuates the unique intimacy of the minors and brings the dreams of the players to center stage: Just by being in Bakersfield, they are showing they’ll do just about anything to make it to the big leagues.
If I sound trite, it’s because you don’t drive 200 miles round trip on a whim if you’re not looking for something that’s a little bit cliche. Since I moved to California for the summer, I’ve grown more nervous by the day about my plans for the future. I’ve been stressing mostly about my “career” and what that will look like when I graduate in 10 months, with the usual doses of girl questions and other social things tossed in. I’m not going to lie that it’s been a little more difficult than I thought being 3,000 miles away from home in a new town where I don’t know anybody. It felt good to be in Bakersfield because I was pretty sure a few of the ballplayers felt the same way.
As I keep trying to figure it all out, I’ll be in the scenic ballparks of California. They’re good places for my occasional Instagram, and even better for my predictable, pre-Senior year angst.

Nestled along the Charles River across the street from Starbucks and Trader Joe’s is the Magazine Beach Bath House, a free public pool. Now that Mother Nature has decided to grace Cambridge with some actual summer weather, Flyby wants to bring this hidden gem, open every day until 7 p.m., to light.
The good:
The pool is big, deep but not too deep, and all kinds of refreshing. This definitely isn’t one of those pools that is filled with ice-cold hose water TJ’s and Starbucks are right there, so stock up on your summer treats on the way home.It’s free. Even if you’re not the swimming type, you can go to get your tan on without spending your precious cash money.There’s a cute grill-picnic area and soccer field next to the pool.
The bad:
It’s crowded, because college kids definitely aren’t the only demographic that likes cooling off on a summer day. If it’s at capacity, which it probably will be on weekend afternoons, you might have to wait in line for a bit, too.The walk is a tad long. A mile and a half is definitely not a breeze when you’re armed with a pool bag, towel, etc., and it’s 95 degrees.Food is aggressively prohibited in the pool area. If you’re going to try and sneak in an elaborate picnic lunch, proceed with caution.
Overall, though, Flyby gives this pool a thumbs up. If anything, it’s a much-needed break between sweating at work and sweating in your dorm room.
