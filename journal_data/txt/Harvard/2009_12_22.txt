After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A derailed Red Line train interrupted T service around 4:00 p.m. Tuesday, according to an alert from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Web site.
The fourth car in a six-car train traveling outbound to Alewife slipped off the rails just south of the Alewife Station, according to the Boston Globe. Sixty-five T passengers were evacuated from the car and no injuries have been reported.
The MBTA has replaced subway service between Alewife and Harvard with shuttle buses covering every stop between the two stations.
MBTA Spokesman Joe Pesaturo could not be reached for comment Tuesday evening.
In early November, an independent review of the MBTA's operations and management found significant water damage to the concrete slabs that hold the rails between the Harvard and Alewife Stations. The report warned that trains traveling between these two stations were in danger of derailment.
The review—requested by Mass. Governor Deval L. Patrick '78—reported that unfunded repairs to "safety-critical" areas of the transportation system totaled $543 million.
According to the report, the projected cost of repairing the problems with the Red Line—a widely used mode of transportation for members of the Harvard community—is $80 million.
Going into the 2010 fiscal year, the MBTA originally faced a deficit of $186 million and warned there may be large fare hikes to both subway and bus services. The budget gap was closed after the MBTA made $26 million in cuts and the Mass. legislature appropriated $160 million in revenue from sales taxes to the MBTA.
The T has suffered from a slew of recent service interruptions. On Monday, there were delays at the Porter Square station while a wall panel was removed due to water leakage. Last week, a Green Line train derailed near Copley Square, resulting in no injuries but long delays.

The Crimson travels to the nation’s  capital to take on the No. 13 Hoyas at noon (EST) Wednesday at the  Verizon Center.
An excellent Georgetown men’s basketball blog, Casual Hoya, interviews an expert  on the opposing side before each game. The victim this time is The  Crimson’s own Martin Kessler. The proud Cambridge Rindge and Latin  grad discusses recruiting, Jeremy Lin, and gives a shout out to Felipe’s  too. Nice work, Martin!

As the cold began to bite down hard earlier this month, the students of Anthropology 1130: "Archaeology of Harvard Yard" (taught by archaeology professor William L. Fash), closed up their hole in the Yard and went home. Their biggest discovery? A wall.
The main clue was the way the dirt in one part of the excavated site abruptly changed color. Sandwiched between two strips of dark red-orange dirt was an unexpected layer of gray. This, the class concluded, could be none other than evidence for one wall of the Indian College, a school Harvard had established in 1655 for the education and Christianization of Native Americans. The building is believed to have been located perpendicular to the edge of what is now Matthews.
The dig site, which consisted of 10 adjacent 1 meter by 1 meter units, was started in late September and revisited at least once a week. Students divided into teams and dug about 10 centimeters at a time, taking pictures and recording what they found (or didn't find).
Among the more interesting discoveries were pipe stems, ceramics with hand-painted designs, and glass bottles. The students who originally owned these objects didn't know it back then, but these will now be used by archaeologists to learn about life at this 17th century college. (Makes us think twice about throwing that empty Cape Cod chips bag on the ground.) These recovered artifacts have been donated to the Peabody Museum, where Fash serves as the director.
In mid-October, Daniel Balmori '11, a Government concentrator, found a slate pencil while casually digging through the dirt. He said that slate pencils, which were used to draft messages before transferring them to ink and paper, were the only academic artifacts uncovered at the site. What else was found? Evidence of other, less admirable activities.
"The focus of the class has really been on historical archaeology, because it tries to combine both written record and material culture," Balmori said. "What you have often are contradictions. Where the rules say you will be punished if you smoke or drink, you find pipes and glass bottles."
Guess 17th century college students did more than just study.
