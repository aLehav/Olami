After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Upon graduating from Harvard in 2014, I moved to New York City to embark on a year of exploring the education non-profit world. As the first in my family to go to college, I was eager to give back to the University; I soon found myself working with a local alumni group that connects with high schools in the outer boroughs of the city to expose less advantaged students to Harvard. I represented the university at college fairs full of students who reminded me of myself in many ways.
One Hispanic couple remains in my memory. The man was gray-haired and scruffy, and the woman wore a warm smile and curly head of Afro-Latina excellence. They approached the table as gingerly as mice. I tried to make them feel more comfortable by asking some low-risk questions; nevertheless, Dad did most of the talking—his English was better. He slowly revealed that they were here to do some research on behalf of their son, who couldn’t make the fair because he was at a debate competition. Eventually, he asked me the question that I knew they were thinking—the same question that I had asked myself thousands of times. “People like us—we’re from the South Bronx—do we really belong at a place like Harvard?” Their son was attending Regis, an exclusive prep school on the Upper East Side, on a scholarship and had a strong academic and extracurricular profile from what I could tell. “Absolutely; people like your son belong at Harvard,” I said, “because Harvard needs people like your son.”
That’s what conservative-activist Ron Unz and the slate of candidates seeking election to Harvard’s Board of Overseers fail to recognize. Unz's calls for "free tuition" ring hollow to those of us from less economically advantaged backgrounds who have gone to Harvard. The vast majority of Harvard College students graduate debt free—for example, only a quarter of the Class of 2012 required loans. Surely a "fair" system would be to ensure that those who need financial support get help, as opposed to funding those who can afford to pay.
Claims persist that this free tuition proposal will raise awareness of Harvard as an option for students who may not have considered the Ivy League before. But for the family I met in New York, as for so many others like them, it's not about being hindered by the price tag. Rather, it's about feeling as though one does not possess the pedigree and social capital required to even knock on the door of the Ivies—an externality of the exclusive legacy that Harvard and its peers spent centuries constructing.
These deep social schisms complicate the college admissions process, especially if it were altered to reflect Unz’s vision. A system based solely on numbers—on test scores and grades—makes it easier to forget these truths. In education, scores are often perceived as objective barometers of student ability, as a universally understood and cost-effective measurement. But research demonstrates that numbers don't denote truth with a capital T (or rather, "A" for ability). SAT scores, highly correlated with parental income, are more reflective of preparation than aptitude; GPA is more a measure of persistence and buy-in than IQ. None of this is to say that these criteria are deceptive to the point of warranted abolition. Instead, revering scores over other aspects of college applications makes the process no more meritocratic. If anything, it demonstrates a deep ignorance of the inequities that plague our K-12 system.
I won’t harp on the many themes of exclusivity on Ivy League campuses. Many students from disadvantaged beginnings, including myself, have stories that illustrate the reality that elite colleges often feel like they were constructed for a very particular segment of the population. And that’s because they were.
But minds can change and institutions can grow over time. Harvard has demonstrated this through using holistic review in its college admissions process—a process that considers the whole person and serves as the key to unlocking a diverse educational experience. This is an extremely privileged phenomenon in college admissions reserved for institutions with the resources required to evaluate college applications in a more time intensive, but thoughtful, way. As an outsider of the admissions process who has spent a lot of time looking in, I would best describe holistic review as a way of contextualizing a college application—putting the numbers in the context of a story to gain a more complete understanding of a prospective student's potential.
Ultimately, the belief that any one alumnus or activist has the right and expertise to deem who deserves or does not deserve to be admitted to a private institution of higher learning does not fully appreciate the college admissions process. In short, it is wrong. Critics who demand access to admissions processes don’t understand that one of the central objectives of Harvard's admissions process, in addition to deciding who gets in, is crafting an entire class—the musicians, the future scientists and sociologists, the rowers, the international students. There’s no quota or magic number. It is the collective, crafted by an admissions process that considers every aspect of prospective students, that creates the transformative experience that I and so many other Harvard alumni muse over at college fairs and beyond.
As beneficiaries of this transformative experience, alumni should think twice before voting for candidates who would seek to undermine that process and compromise what makes Harvard special.

To the editor:
Our conversation about the final clubs has made world headlines, arousing some mix of curiosity, perplexity and astonishment.  It's time to think about what this means for Harvard's relationship to the real world, not just to the final clubs.
Some common-sense comparison points may illuminate outsiders' puzzlement.
My youngest daughter first attended a coed primary school but then asked to transfer to the next-door all-girls school because it was calmer. Later she attended coed schools but in her last two years experienced a special time at a UK girls school. No one in the UK had the effrontery to order her headmistress to admit males.
At Princeton she surveyed the eating clubs but found no congenial ambience so joined the 2D vegetarian coop where she and friends took turns cooking for themselves.   No Princeton dean had the effrontery to order 2D to admit carnivores and let them cook meat in the vegetarian kitchen.
The use of threats and intimidation to force conformity on those with divergent views and different tastes happens elsewhere, but a perception of zealous overreach by Harvard's own leadership can diminish the sense of ease others need to feel to interact confidently with us, whether as student applicants, donors, or collaborators in a multitude of other ways.  Others are listening intently. Think about this.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When cleaning a weapon, you operate in a strange sort of stasis; your hands work independently as your mind drifts into the unknown yet blissful waters of mental purgatory. Or so I’m told. For the majority of the three hours I spent cleaning M-16s last Sunday, I was pretty stressed. With good company, one can make even the most menial tasks exciting. But unfortunately, the thought of my upcoming Russian exam kept me from finding the therapeutic merits of rifle cleaning.
The transition between cadet land and Harvard makes for hectic weekends. One moment, I’m running through the woods fighting the South Atropian People’s Army (SAPA, a fictitious guerilla force made up of senior ROTC cadets). Next thing I know, I’m in line to return my rifle as I come to the horrifying realization that Uncle Sam took all the time I needed to finish that essay that’s suddenly due tomorrow.
The expectations cadets encounter are what make the transition between school and ROTC both humorous and difficult. At Harvard, people think I’m some kind of tactical genius because I happen to wear an Army uniform. Sure, I understand some Army acronyms, but my tactical prowess has yet to emerge. In late February, for example, we ran a platoon operations simulation, during which I forgot to bring a map. Let’s just say the operation didn’t start as planned.
Then come the expectations from other cadets. Every summer, cadets from across the country are flown to Ft. Knox. Last summer, I found myself among these cadets, surrounded by people from just about everywhere. Upon my platoon’s discovery that I attended Harvard, things got…interesting. You see, people have one of two expectations when they discover you’re from Harvard. Either 1) you’re a pretentious loudmouth, or 2) you’re some soft spoiled kid who’s absolutely useless in the field. And no matter what you do, there’s no escape from confirming either stereotype.
For starters, my field skills weren’t the most refined. I was a Boy Scout, so I knew a few knots, but most of the other cadets had spent their entire lives living in areas I deem inhospitable (growing up in Los Angeles made me weak). My experience with firearms was limited to firing a .22 rifle once. Conversely, most of the other cadets already knew how to take apart an M-16. When instructed to set up a hooch (a primitive tent of sorts) in the field, my living space resembled that of a sad, drenched caterpillar that failed metamorphosis. My peers, on the other hand, found themselves warm and dry in their five-star shelters.
Making conversation presented a whole other problem. You see, the Paul Revere Battalion has grown accustomed to my strange breed of political humor (or so I hope). My Soviet at ego and reliance on the word “comrade” has earned me a special position as the battalion’s resident commie. However, some cadets from other regions aren’t too familiar with my kind of humor. My jokes regarding revolution, communism, and the collective convinced a few cadets that I was indeed a Russian infiltrator sent from Harvard to destroy Ft. Knox from within. My enrollment in Russian isn’t exactly helping me deflect these accusations.
Cadet Initial Entry Training was almost a year ago, yet here I am today, fumbling my way through the government department and the field. Can I clean a rifle? Depends on your standard of cleanliness. Have I mastered Russian? Я говорю по-русски плохо (not really). Have I learned to sympathize with my colleagues who think a 0830 wakeup call is early? Of course not.
Yet, oddly enough, despite their discrepancies, there are moments when Harvard and ROTC operate in peace—maybe even in tandem. Getting tear-gassed last summer at CIET provided me with excellent material for dining hall conversations. The factoids I’ve learned throughout my time at Harvard have granted me verbal ammunition with which to entertain my fellow cadets when we’re bored beyond belief.
About two weeks ago, we started reading Mikhail Lermontov’s “A Hero of Our Time” in Russian class. In the novel, Pechorin, a cruel yet clever Russian officer, finds himself battling fate as he’s thrown from one mishap to another. Despite his intelligence, during one of his misadventures he loses a bet due to a pistol’s misfire. Serves him right; every officer should ensure that their soldiers properly clean their weapons.
I’m not nearly as handsome as Pechorin, nor half as clever. However, being caught between Harvard and ROTC has taught me something Pechorin lacked: a sense of how little I know, and a willingness to talk about it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A recent Crimson feature suggested that Undergraduate Council event funding, which is based on attendance estimates, is significantly overblown. The overall estimated attendance for grant-receiving events occasionally exceeds the total undergraduate population and frequently eclipses believability, indicating that students organizations are inflating attendance expectations to receive more funding. And at the moment, the UC has no system in place for verification.
At the core of this problem are student groups looking to exaggerate attendance estimates for their events. The UC’s Finance Committee, which gives about $300,000 to student organizations each year, funds food at $2 to $4 per person and transportation at $4.50 per person. Since funding is partially based on attendance estimates, groups have a clear incentive to inflate their numbers, especially given the lack of a strong verification method. This has led to the current situation, in which the number of undergraduates expected to attend events daily often exceeds 3,500—over half of the size of the student body. In the words of UC Finance Committee Chair William A. Greenlaw ’17, “You’re telling me that one in two people attend all events on campus? There’s no way.”
A monitoring system on the part of the UC would be difficult to implement, as would any effort to prove that student groups are consciously being dishonest in their estimates. But whether in the form of random event evaluations, a restructured grant application, or a decrease in funding across the board, the UC should use its power to audit student organizations and curtail any malpractice. Students are charged a $75 UC student activities fee on their term bills each year, and it should not be put to waste.
After all, Harvard’s campus is already over-programmed. A brief glance at a campus bulletin board or any of the House email lists reveals as much. The UC should thus consider ways to consolidate events. So far this academic year, just 5.24 percent of events have been collaborations between student organizations—down from 5.56 percent the year before. Given these low numbers, we find Greenlaw’s emphasis on increasing joint events between clubs quite valuable. In order to implement this plan, the UC could provide a financial incentive to encourage collaboration on events between clubs. Bolstered by a system by which clubs requesting funds can see what other student organizations are planning, this would prioritize quality of events over quantity.

Two local high school students are planning the Empathy Project, an initiative to raise awareness of homeless newspaper vendors on May 7, with the support of the Harvard Square Business Association.

Christy Felix and Yusef Ferhani, students at the Community Charter School of Cambridge, spearheaded the initiative. High school students around Massachusetts will sell newspapers in their towns on the one day event.
Felix and Ferhani said they conceived the project out of the senior-year internship that they completed at the Harvard Square Business Association, which has partnered with the pair’s high school to provide internship opportunities for students for seven years.
Felix and Ferhani said the project aims to put students in the shoes of vendors of Spare Change News, a local street newspaper that aims to give homeless and low-income vendors a means to earn an income.
“The public has a general view of the homeless that’s really inaccurate and it’s kind of sad. Most people just don’t understand,” Ferhani said.
Through the project, organizers hope to alert high school students to the difficulties homeless people face in earning an income. Each newspaper usually costs 35 cents and street vendors sell it for $1.00, making 65 cents per paper.
“There are many times all of us have walked by those Spare Change vendors not picking up the paper, not really paying attention, and not really understanding or appreciating how hard they work to make a living,” Denise A. Jillson, Executive Director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said.
Katherine Bennett, Executive Director of Spare Change News, said she also hopes the project will reduce a generational gap regarding awareness of the newspaper. According to Bennett, most of the organization’s outreach goes towards people over 30.
“It’s not so much that there is any sort of [generational] divide really, it is more just a lack of knowledge,” she said.
According to Jillson, Felix and Ferhani mostly led the preparations for the event, including developing the project and reaching out to local schools, while the Harvard Business Association supported them in outreach efforts.
The organizers expect about 100 students to participate in the event and hope the project will expand to other locations in the country.

A new student group advocating for the expansion of Asian American studies at Harvard received recognition as an official organization by the Office of Student Life on Monday, allowing them to fundraise for a possible tenured faculty position in the field.
Students established the organization, called the Taskforce on Asian and Pacific American Studies, at the end of last semester. Juhwan Seo ’17, one of the leaders of TAPAS, said the organization will now begin to ramp up discussions with administrators and faculty members about the feasibility of fundraising for such a professorship. Official recognition allows the group to open an OSL-recognized bank account and use OSL resources to contact potential alumni donors.
“Without the existence of serious classes and scholarship, Harvard will never be interested in creating a [secondary] or a concentration [in Asian American studies],” Seo said. “That’s our longest goal, and more ambitious: raising money so that we can have professors who can create at least a minor in Asian American studies.”
The group’s formation comes at a time when students and faculty have increasingly advocated for ethnic studies programs at Harvard. As the Committee on Ethnicity, Migration, and Rights last fall created a secondary field in Latino Studies, students have continued to voice concern about a perceived lack of academic offerings in Asian American studies.
“Currently, there is no Asian American studies secondary, concentration, or certificate. There’s no formalized program,” Undergraduate Council Freshman Class Committee Chair Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18 said. “There are only Asian American classes that are offered in ones or twos every semester, often from visiting professors.”
Before starting their fundraising push, which Seo says aims to focus primarily on the Harvard Asian American Alumni Alliance, members of TAPAS are working to raise awareness about what they describe as a need for expanded academic offerings.
“Our goal really is to be the student voice and the activism that can bring about a real movement for Asian American and Pacific studies at Harvard,” Seo said.
To that end, TAPAS leaders including Seo and Sidney C. Li ’19 have hosted a number of events, such as movie nights and speaker series featuring experts in Asian American studies.
Last October, the College formed a working group under the purview of the Committee on Ethnicity, Migration, and Rights, which, separate from the student organization, is also working to expand the field at Harvard.
Several UC representatives have voiced support for the effort, which UC Education Committee Chair Scott Ely ’18 said was consistent with his committee’s goals to advocate for underrepresented groups at the College.
“Moving forward, in conversations with faculty and administrators, we simply have to do more to advocate for Asian American studies and [articulate] why it’s important to students,” UC Dudley House representative Laila M. Smith ’17 said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rapper and Vice News correspondent Bernard ‘Bun B’ Freeman criticized the rhetoric of this year’s presidential election at a talk with Institute of Politics Fellow and former Houston mayor Annise Parker on Tuesday.
Sponsored by the IOP Fellows Program, the Harvard Black Students Association, and Conversations with Kirkland, the event focused on Freeman’s role in the fields of music and politics.
Freeman called the rhetoric used in this year’s presidential election divisive, adding that his experience on the campaign trail has made him realize the potential emotional impact of political language.
“It’s very hard to go into these places and see this type of rhetoric being spewed,” he said. “It’s even harder to do it as a human being.  The first thing I realized when I started this was that it was not going to be fun.”
He also emphasized the importance of civic engagement. Freeman said while the majority of Texas is liberal, low civic engagement has led to a conservative voting population. He said the problem stems from an overemphasis on voter turnout in presidential elections.
In addition to politics, Freeman also shared his thoughts on the current state of hip-hop music. specifically discussing the spiritual role music can play in people’s lives.
“For some people, hip hop allows them a way to look at the world in a different way,” he said. “It allows them to become a better person to the world.  It allows them to carry doctrines and rituals that help them contribute to society.”
The rapper also encouraged leaders of the hip-hop industry to be more inclusive of artists who may not fit traditional standards in that musical genre.
“How can we tell people they belong when they’re doing it better than we are?" he said.
Justin D. Porter ’17, a self-described fan of UGK, the duo of which Freeman is a member, said he appreciated the opportunity to hear Freeman speak about his experience covering the presidential campaigns.
“For him to be speaking about the presidential election with the mayor of Houston at such a pivotal moment in our nation’s history, for him to be discussing exactly what he’s observed from a first-hand experience… it’s amazing all the way around,” he said.
Amrita Vir, a student at the Harvard Kennedy School and the Harvard Business School, praised Freeman's conversation at Harvard.
“When you think of Harvard, Bun B isn’t what you think of as like the typical speaker here,” she said.  “And I think it just goes to show what a dynamic, unique place this is where we can have speakers like this sitting in Kirkland House.”

Half a year after some undergraduates criticized a University-issued frequently asked questions document about sexual assault as legalistic and inaccessible, Harvard’s Title IX Office has added a new series of answers to questions about campus sexual harassment policy and procedures.
The updated documents come as Harvard's central office for investigating sexual harassment continues to evaluate more cases. That office, the Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution, has heard 40 cases since it opened in September 2014, up from 34 in February, according to Mia Karvonides, the University’s Title IX Officer.
The documents, an expansion on the list of “Frequently Asked Questions” released last semester, include an additional 14 questions and answers, a flow chart detailing how the ODR investigates complaints of sexual harassment, and a list of sexual assault resources from the University, Cambridge and Boston, and Massachusetts state.
Karvonides said she hopes the new documents, the result of student consultation and meetings, will better clarify students’ questions and confusion about the University’s sexual harassment procedures.
"We knew the first of FAQs was really responding to questions about the legal basis and we knew that there would be other questions that needed to be explored and that are really more responsive to students’ day to day experiences,” Karvonides said.
Last semester, the Title IX Office released 10 pages of FAQs, a stipulation of the Title IX resolution agreement Harvard signed with the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights after that agency found Harvard Law School in violation of Title IX at the end of 2014. That initial document clarified, among other points, that students may use attorneys as personal advisers over the course of a sexual harassment investigation.
Some student activists quickly denounced the initial document as legalistic and inaccessible. The Title IX Office has now crafted the additional questions to respond to student concerns and questions.
Beyond information about interim measures that students may seek over the course of a sexual harassment investigation, the new document also contains questions about the timeframe of ODR investigations, filing anonymous complaints, and how ODR works with the Harvard University Police Department. The FAQ document now also includes statistics about ODR complaints. Karvonides said that at the time the document was prepared, ODR had received 36 formal complaints, 13 of which involved parties in a dating or close relationship.
“I think this does a much better job of breaking things apart in a way that students can understand and it’s more relevant to a students’ experience,” Drisana M. Mosaphir ’17, a member of Our Harvard Can Do Better who helped craft the new FAQs, said.
Karvonides said that she and other students decided to incorporate all of the FAQs into the same document, rather than splitting them into different items, so that the secondary resources would not include redundant explanations of the policy and procedures.
Both Karvonides and Mosaphir said the new points of guidance will help better answer student questions as the Title IX office develops additional secondary resources.
"We’ll continue to develop things and really welcome input from people about whether these resources are helpful or whether they feel there are other things we should be developing," Karvonides said.
The expanded secondary materials about Harvard’s sexual harassment policy and procedures come as a host of administrators and students across the University focus on Title IX compliance and sexual assault. Earlier this semester, a University-wide task force dedicated to sexual assault prevention released its final report, calling for mandatory, annual sexual assault prevention training, among other recommendations.
A committee of faculty, students, and staff from across Harvard has also begun meeting to study and potentially reconsider Harvard’s Title IX framework. A federal investigation into the College’s compliance with Title IX remains ongoing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 19, 2016, at 11:36 p.m.
In response to a series of rules violations that the Undergraduate Council’s Finance Committee had not previously identified, the committee was forced to revoke funding from four student organizations this week.
Each year, the UC Finance Committee is allocated about $300,000, funded by a $75 undergraduate termbill fee, to distribute to student organizations in the form of grants. The Office of Student Life stipulates that the grants may not fund events that take place during shopping, reading, and final examinations periods.
UC Treasurer Samarth Gupta ’18 said he believes the policy ensures there will not “be many extracurriculars going on during reading period and finals so that students can focus on academics.”
In practice, however, the UC has struggled to enforce that rule.
Earlier this month, the UC voted to allocate funding for five events scheduled between April 28 and May 6, totaling $1,945 worth of funding. Reading period begins on April 28.
In one case, the Bach Society Orchestra requested funding for their fourth concert, which according to the organization’s website is set to take place one day after reading period begins, on April 29. The organization requested $1,000 in funding for costs including venue rentals, programs, and instrument rentals. The application also stated that funding from the UC would help allow free admission to the concert.
In their application for funding from the UC, the organization reported that the event would end by April 27, one day before reading period begins.
Finance Committee Chair William A. Greenlaw ’17 said that since the event is scheduled to take place during reading period, the group is ineligible to receive funding. Greenlaw also expressed concern over possible misrepresentation of information on the group’s grant application.
“If Bach Society Orchestra has willfully misrepresented the date of their event to receive money, we'll have to have a serious conversation about how to handle their grants in the future,” Greenlaw wrote in a message.
In a statement to The Crimson, Bach Society Orchestra’s management wrote that “our grant team listed [April 27] as the end date because it represents our last rehearsal and thus the end of our preparations for the anticipated concert. While we certainly should've listed the end date as April 29th, the period listed on the grant does encompass the vast majority of the preparation necessary for the concert.”
“While this was certainly an oversight, characterizing it as ‘dishonesty’ would be unfair,” the statement added.
The funding concerns come at a time when the UC’s Finance Committee has struggled to enforce grant policy rules and debates further methods to hold student organizations accountable.
The committee’s policy rules also state that “evidence of dishonesty when applying or interviewing for a grant is grounds for disqualification of a student group from receiving future funding from the Undergraduate Council.”
In four other instances this month, organizations submitted requests for funding to the UC and accurately reported that their events were set to take place during reading period. Still, the Finance Committee and the UC as a general body voted to allocate funding for the events.
“It just so happens that sometimes, our enforcement isn't perfect, so some groups slip through the cracks,” Greenlaw wrote.
In one of those four cases, Gupta had distributed a $400 grant allocated to the Harvard College Bolivian Association. Greenlaw confirmed that the UC “awarded them their grant in error.”
In the other three instances—grants allocated to Tempus: The Harvard College History Review, the Harvard Ballet Company, and the Signet Society, a group of undergraduate artists and writers—the UC was able to revoke the funding allocation before the groups received grants, according to Greenlaw.
“We won't be able to give them funding it seems, but they won't be punished for their honesty,” Greenlaw wrote.
In the case of the Signet Society, the timing of the grant was not the only rules violation. The Signet Society is not an OSL-recognized student group, and UC rules stipulate that “only officially recognized student groups in good standing with the Office of Student Life may apply for UC grants.”
When asked about Signet’s grant, Greenlaw confirmed that the Signet Society is not eligible to receive grants. Earlier this semester, the Signet Society received a $390 grant from the UC for their “A Little Night Music” event.
“This is another problem with enforcement,” Greenlaw wrote. “The common app does not easily screen out non-recognized student organizations, so we're forced to take students at their word. This doesn't necessarily mean Signet was being dishonest though. It just means that we might not have clarified the policy.”
Gupta said he would consider advocating for a change to the reading period policy in the future, but that the Council must follow the current rules.
“We hate for them to not have their event, but the policy guide is pretty clear,” Gupta said.

CORRECTION: April 19, 2016

Environmental conservationist Philippe Cousteau, Jr. reflected on his family history and the changing role the media has played in spreading the environmental movement this Tuesday for the 2016 Lowell Lecture.
The talk, titled “A Legacy of Hope and Solutions for the 21st Century,” was organized by the Harvard Extension School and the Lowell Institute of Boston.
Historically, the Lowell Lecture has been an annual event that highlights major societal problems.
“We wanted to bring Philippe in because he utilizes multiple different platforms, and each one reaches a different group,” George D. Buckley, the assistant director of sustainability at the Harvard Extension School, said.
Cousteau, Jr. comes from a long line of conservationists. His father, Philippe Cousteau, was a documentary filmmaker and oceanographer. His grandfather, Jacques-Yves Cousteau, was a marine conservationist who co-developed the SCUBA.
“I think we know right now that our oceans are in great danger, and there is no family on Earth who has brought these issues to our attention like the Cousteau family,” said Huntington D. Lambert, dean of the Division of Continuing Education and University Extension at Harvard.
“When I think of my grandfather, and this really is the theme of the evening, I think of him as a problem solver,” Cousteau, Jr. said. “The legacies of the Cousteaus are as problem solvers.”
Utilizing numerous video clips of past documentaries and news stories, Cousteau Jr. stressed how new forms of media can reach untapped audiences.
“The challenge for us is how do we grow our audience,” Cousteau, Jr. said. “I fault many of the folks in the environmental movement for preaching to the converted.”
To cap off the evening, Cousteau, Jr. brought up a new avenue that he has lately explored: impact investing.
Impact investing is a form of investing that focuses on companies that generate a positive social or environmental impact.
“People have to be part of the equation, we have to think differently and be willing to challenge the status quo, especially with regards to sustainability,” Cousteau, Jr. said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Questlove Gomez, co-founder and drummer of The Roots and bandleader for “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” highlighted the connections between cooking and music in a Tuesday discussion with New Yorker writer Ben Greenman and two chefs.

The event was part of the public lecture series organized for “Science and Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to the Science of Soft Matter,” a Gen Ed course that fulfills the Science of the Physical Universe requirement. Although the talks are usually held in the fall, the event was hosted to coincide with the release of Gomez’s new book, somethingtofoodabout, according to course preceptor Pia Sorensen.
“The purpose of the talks in general is to connect cooking with science,” Sorensen said. “Often what comes up in these talks is creativity. The creativity of how chefs think, the creativity of science… how they’re similar and how they’re different.”
The talk mirrored the structure of Gomez’s book, which details spontaneous conversations with ten chefs about their imaginative cooking.
In front of a packed Science Center audience, the author highlighted many connections between his experiences of making music and the chefs’ creative culinary processes. Both chefs said they shared Gomez’s frustration of pleasing the audience while pursuing innovations.
“One of the things I found is that sweet spot, which was within my taste, which expressed my creativity, but was constrained a little,” said chef Daniel Patterson.
Gomez also discussed his perception of a social stratification in the food world because only relatively few people have access to high-end food. He lauded Patterson for opening Locol, a healthy fast-food restaurant in Watts, Los Angeles.
“You come from this high-end, high-class food world, and you decided to pay it forward by literally coming... in one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in America, to open up a restaurant so that everybody in the community could have access to that food,” he said.
Patterson, who is also a food writer, said he was inspired to open his restaurant because of his experience teaching children how to cook.
“I went as far as I could go and learned as much as I could from the high end, then turned around and realized some kids have no taste memory for real food,” he said. “There are two Americas, and we are going to the America that no one else is going to.”
Chef Ludo Lefebvre also noted the impact of his childhood on his decision to pursue a culinary career when an eleven-year-old audience member asked him, in French, about his inspiration.
“It’s simple: at school, I was a very bad student. My dad came to me one day and said you’re getting kicked out of this school, so you can be a hairdresser, a mechanician, or a cook,” he said. “It was second grade, so I thought, well, that’s it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Harvard women’s lacrosse is in the thick of an eight-day span in which it plays three ranked opponents. But with crosstown rivals Boston College paying a visit on Wednesday night, Crimson players insist that they are up to the challenge.
“Our coaches have been emphasizing that we really need to play together as a cohesive unit,” sophomore midfielder Julia Glynn said. “We need to limit our mistakes and capitalize on theirs.”
Overcoming the Eagles will mean ending a five-game losing streak against them, as Harvard has not emerged victorious in the series since a 2010 win. A victory in 2016 can also give the Crimson a much needed boost after last weekend, when the team suffered a difficult last-minute loss at No. 15/17 Penn.
In that contest junior attacker Marisa Romeo netted a free-position shot to pull Harvard within one goal of the Quakers with just 33 seconds left of play. However, the Crimson missed the opportunity to take Penn to overtime, walking away with a nail-biting 8-7 loss.
Though Harvard (7-4, 3-2 Ivy) could not end its 18-game losing streak to the Quakers on Saturday, the team hopes to bring its recent slide against No. 14/16 Boston College (9-2) to a halt. Last year, the Eagles denied that objective by  securing a comfortable 19-13 win over their rivals.
With a big game looming on the horizon this weekend against conference foe No. 16/18 Cornell, the Crimson will also look to gain momentum with a midweek triumph.
“Our goal is to play our best against BC tomorrow night,” junior attacker Maeve McMahon said. “BC and Cornell are somewhat similar in aspect of the game, so it’s definitely helpful have these two back to back.”
To overcome Boston College, the Crimson will have to reverse its fortunes against ranked teams, as it has not earned a single victory against such an opponent so far this season. Losses to No. 11 Princeton and No. 14 Penn were the squad’s closest calls, as both matches were determined by a single score.
Against out-of-conference opponents, Harvard has not been able to draw as close, losing to both No. 5 Syracuse and No. 8 Stanford by nearly double digits.
The Eagles, meanwhile, are ranked and on a two-game winning streak. Senior midfielder Sarah Mannelly has been instrumental for her team recently, tallying 14 points over the past two games.
The New Canaan, Conn. native notched two goals and a career-high five assists in her team’s 14-9 win over Dartmouth. Before that she had scored five goals and assited two in a 15-10 victory over Virginia Tech.
The preseason All-American is 23rd in the nation in assists per game with 1.73 and 27th in points per game with 3.80. Mannelly has been at the top of her game when creating opportunities for her teammates, and she is a dangerous player to watch in Wednesday’s matchup.
“Our defense has limited some of the best attackers in the country this season,” McMahon said. “That experience will definitely help us defend her tomorrow.”
On the other end of the field, the Crimson looks to capitalize on an Eagles defense that is not ranked in the top-50 in the nation.
Romeo and Glynn will be the top threats for Harvard. Romeo leads the team with 24 goals on the season, while Glynn has a team-high 16 assists. The two players are tied for most points on the team with 35.
Still, the major key to the Crimson’s success on Wednesday will be the defense, led by co-captain goalie Kelly Weis, whose saving percentage of 50.3 percent is good for 12th best in the nation.
To pull the upset, Harvard will need its defense, ranked 17th in the country, to step up against a Boston College attack that is ranked 19th nationwide (the Eagles score an average 12.47 goals per game).
Junior defender Marina Burke and co-captain and fellow defender Tory Waldstein, who are tied for the team lead with 15 caused turnovers this season, will need to be major contributors in this effort.
“Our defense and goalie Kelly Weis have been playing incredible this season,” Glynn said. “We will need them to continue that tomorrow to secure a win."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In general sailing is not a spectator sport. Races can take place far offshore, and any spectators who show up face the possibility of seaside breezes and brooding clouds.
But every four years, sailors come under the wide world’s gaze when they compete for a gold medal at the Olympics. This year, two graduating seniors are gunning for a place in the global spotlight as they prepare to leave Harvard and train for international competition.
LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON
“A lot of people don’t necessarily realize how intense a sport sailing can be,” senior Marek Zaleski said. “Especially in classes as physical as the 49er and the laser, whoever works the hardest and is the fittest generally is the person who wins.”
Despite these physical challenges, sailing was something that Zaleski always knew that he wanted to do. He practically grew up on the water, spending time in a baby carrier on his dad’s chest while his dad steered the boat.
Starting when he was six, Marek began competing in Optimists, a class of dinghies. He moved up to bigger boats at the age of 12, which was when he fell in love with the laser.
Consisting of one sail, one sailor, and 14 feet of sleek design, the laser represents the purest form of sailing, one that requires impeccable technique to steer. Such a challenge appealed to Zaleski, perhaps because a willingness to confront difficulties head-on ran in his family.
Zaleski’s parents were born and raised in Poland. His mom immigrated to the United States first, carrying 25 dollars, a backpack, and nothing else. Less than two years later, his dad followed suit after his mom managed to obtain immigration papers with the assistance of an Oklahoma congresswoman.
Reunited in an unfamiliar country, the couple built their own businesses from the ground up. In this way, Zaleski gradually learned from his parents what sustained hard work and success looked like.
With such mentors in his life, Zaleski doesn’t shy away from the arduous road to the Olympics. As Zaleski explained, he quickly realized that there was a potential to do something special, namely to achieve success in a serious way and leave a mark on the sport.
Zaleski hopes to do so at the 2020 Olympics through the laser class, a race that includes 50 nations. Each country has its own selection process to determine which boat will compete.
After graduating on May 26th and competing at college nationals, Marek will fly to Europe for two months of training with the Polish national team. The process will include international races in January in New Zealand, Australia, and other locations early in the year.
Returning to Poland in the winter, Zaleski will start the sailing season in March.
Then, at least for Zaleski, it’s rinse and repeat for the next four years.
One of Zaleski’s chief concerns at the moment is how he’s going to finance such a long training goal. There is also the possibility that his leap of faith into professional sailing and future effort ultimately won’t lead  the positive results that feature in his dreams.
Yet the uncertainty of the coming years doesn’t seem to faze the graduating senior.
“I truly believe that [it] is a sign of strength not weakness - to have dedicated your life to something for four years and [given] your heart and soul to working hard in perfecting something you love,” Zaleski said. “If anything this will be a great life experience.”
THE BOND OF BROTHERS
“A lot of people don’t completely understand how technical sailing can be,” Harvard captain Andrew Mollerus said. “Constantly changing external conditions really affect the internal dynamic in a boat. And that doesn’t even factor in the specifics of each class of boat.”
Like Zaleski, Mollerus started figuring out these dynamics at an early age. Sailing was something that he wanted to do since roughly age 10, and as college progressed, he became increasingly certain that he wanted to sail professionally.
Certainly, he deliberated back and forth. But as he recalled, he eventually persuaded himself by recognizing just how much he loved the sport—and how difficult it would be to give it up completely.
There was no one race or result that convinced Mollerus that sailing full-time was a good choice. Instead, it was his daily passion and happiness on the water with the Harvard team that made the decision for him.
After graduating this year, Mollerus plans to sail part-time with his younger brother, Matthew While Matthew is finishing out his last year of college, Andrew will be aiming to get a masters degree in statistics.
Then, once Matthew leaves college, the brothers will begin to sail full-time together towards their goal, which is to win enough races and outcompete enough rivals to qualify for the 2020 Olympics in the 49er class.
With faith that the wind will eventually blow their way, the two expect to live together and train together.
“We are more than married,” the older Mollerus said. “But after having known each other our entire lives, we have this knowledge that no matter what happens between us, it will always work out.”
Midway through high school, after sailing separately for some time and competing in different classes, the brothers decided to team up. They wanted to sail together—and so they did.
Joining as a unit gave the Mollerus boys a competitive advantage, as any successful sailing pair must be able to know each other’s habits and coordinate seamlessly.
In many cases, however, it’s difficult to find a long-term sailing partner due to financial and performance pressures. Additionally, different sailors have different technical sailing knowledge, and all duos must find a class of boat that suits both sailors’ experience and maximizes their joint understanding.
By sailing with each other, the Mollerus brothers intimately know each other’s backgrounds, skill sets, and temperaments. Rather than worrying about social dynamics, they are able to focus exclusively on the two objectives of sailing: speed and tactics.
“People always joke about who your best man would be,” said Andrew. “The thing is, there is no question who my best man is. I already know.”
With this bond, Andrew and Matthew plan to forge ahead towards the Olympics, giving four years of their lives to realize a shared dream—to experience the the highest stage of competition, together.
