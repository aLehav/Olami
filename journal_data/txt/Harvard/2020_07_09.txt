After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In search of a ray of hope and optimism, I picked up a pen two months ago and shared with The Crimson the Chinese government’s brutal treatment of my brother Ekpar Asat, a Uighur tech entrepreneur and philanthropist. My op-ed sparked conversations among the Harvard community, even grabbing the attention of human rights champion Ambassador and Professor Samantha J. Power. My brother’s forced disappearance of over four years by the Chinese government prompted a global outcry within the Harvard legal community. Led by Diogo Santana Lopes and Kristin Zornada, more than 80 Harvard-educated lawyers from more than 50 countries rallied around me and issued letters demanding that the Chinese government unconditionally release my brother.
Despite carrying the “Veritas” motto with me as a Harvard Law School graduate, I feared that by speaking out, I’d be doing my brother harm. Ekpar was targeted for participating in a prestigious State Department program as the founder and CEO of a multifaceted social media platform. I worried that any additional American connections would further jeopardize his well-being. Shining a light on the truth can be a matter of life and death when it comes to an authoritarian country like China. So I was deeply moved by the love and support of the Harvard community in response to my article.
Many people questioned, however, why it seems Chinese Harvard affiliates are not speaking out for my brother, Ekpar. A few Chinese alumni and students did contact me to offer sympathy for my brother’s situation. However, there could be many reasons why more have not. The Chinese education system discourages students from engaging in political discourse. Unfortunately, that deeply rooted belief is not easily erased, regardless of exposure to Western ideology and values. Chinese people may also fear that by speaking out, they’d be engaging in politics and therefore subject to potential harassment from the Chinese government.
After the tragic death of George Floyd, many of us in America promised ourselves to be a part of the world where we choose speaking up over silence, action over inaction, love over hate, care over indifference, decency over discrimination. To truly achieve racial justice, we have to carry out the promise today, tomorrow, and onward.
Racial injustice also exists in China, where over 1 million people are locked up in internment camps because of their ethnicities or religions. Without the support of the Chinese and Chinese Americans, it will be difficult to end this unspeakable repression and state terror. These groups can change the course of the Chinese government’s crimes against humanity. Perhaps deliberately, the Chinese government singled out minority ethnic groups so that the majority would turn a blind eye on its oppression. Yet, as William Wilberforce, a campaigner who fought tirelessly against the slave trade in the U.K. so aptly put it: “You may choose to look the other way, but you can never say you did not know.”
In a recent op-ed published in The Crimson, Harvard undergraduates wrote: “We chose Harvard not just because it has the best education in the world, but also because it has the best people.”  China too, as a vast country, has some of the brightest people in the world. So, I appeal to the conscience of Chinese Harvard students, if you are one of these best people chosen by Harvard to carry its brand and legacy. Please speak out against your government’s atrocities. If the entire Harvard Chinese community acts in solidarity, the Chinese government cannot punish them collectively. For a social movement to last longer than a fluttering moment and lead to success, the majority has to lend unyielding support.
I call on Harvard’s Chinese community to stand in solidarity with the Uighurs. Carry the “Veritas” torches of Harvard to shed light on racial injustice and fight against the unfolding genocide in China.
Rayhan Asat is a graduate of Harvard Law School.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Massachusetts moved into the third phase of its reopening plan Monday, Harvard museums and libraries — as well as local fitness centers and movie theaters — are keeping their doors shut.
The latest reopening phase allows “museums, cultural and historical sites” to reopen, but Harvard libraries and museums are still shuttered to visitors.
Anna Burgess, a spokesperson for the Harvard libraries, wrote in an email that it was “too early” to determine when people can re-enter libraries.
“Our restart plan does include eventual user access to physical libraries in some capacity; unfortunately, it’s still too early to know when that will be,” she wrote. “State health guidelines are one of several factors we will consider as we make decisions around physical access.”
University Librarian Martha Whitehead said in an early June interview with the Harvard Gazette, a University-run publication, that libraries would resume physical access “down the road.” The Harvard libraries entered the first phase of their reopening plan June 30, when they started offering in-person book pickups and resumed scan-and-deliver services.
Barbara Beaudoin, director of the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture, wrote in an email that there is no set date for any of these museums to reopen.
Beaudoin noted that the timelines for reopening museums like the Museum of Natural History and the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology may depend on students’ presence on campus and ability to work there.
“The Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments and the Harvard Museum of the Ancient Near East have historically relied on students to support visitors at their admissions desk,” she wrote.
The Harvard Art Museums have also not set a date to reopen, Art Museums spokesperson Daron J. Manoogian wrote in an email.
Beaudoin, Burgess, and Manoogian all wrote that the libraries and museums are still working on formulating reopening plans that prioritize the safety of staff and visitors.
Massachusetts also allowed “fitness centers and health clubs” to reopen during the third phase of its plan. Still, many owners of gyms and fitness facilities in Cambridge say that they are wary of opening too soon in order to keep customers safe.
Shelley E. Cates, the owner of Breathe Cambridge, a yoga studio in Harvard Square, plans on waiting two weeks, until July 20, to reopen her business.
“As a yoga studio, and as a hot yoga studio especially, we just feel like we need to be a little more cautious than what the state guidelines are calling for at this moment,” Cates said. “We certainly don't want to be responsible for anybody getting sick here and we don't want to get sick ourselves.”
By waiting two weeks to reopen, Cates said, she will have a buffer period to see how other reopenings might affect COVID case rates. When Breathe reopens, it will only be able to host eight people in a room that previously held up to 65 or 70 because of social distancing guidelines.
Still, Cates said, she would rather keep Breathe closed longer than put the studio in a potentially unstable situation.
“Two weeks in the grand scheme of things, considering we’ve been closed for almost four months now, isn’t going to make or break us,” Cates said.
Sarah Levin, a spokesperson for CorePower Yoga — a yoga studio chain with a Harvard Square branch — said it has not yet decided on a date to reopen in Massachusetts.
While some Harvard Square recreational businesses are grappling with when to reopen, others have shuttered due to the uncertainty of the pandemic. Bay State Fencers and Wellbridge Athletic Club announced they will close their doors in recent months.
Movie theaters like Brattle Theatre are permitted to reopen under the state guidelines, but they have not set a specific date to reopen. Ned R. Hinkle, the creative director of the Brattle Theatre, said their start date will be closer to the end of July.
In the meantime, the Brattle Theatre is planning their own reopening protocols: protective gear for staff, Plexiglas shields at the concession counters, and de-densifying the theater, among others. In order to keep a six-foot distance between all groups of moviegoers, the theater will only hold 25 people — roughly a tenth of their usual capacity.
In addition to planning health and safety measures for his theater’s reopening, Hinkle is developing its showings.
“I suppose there's some temptation to do something like 28 Days Later or something like that,” Hinkle said, referring to the 2002 post-apocalyptic pandemic movie. “But I think most people have had their fill of those, secretly watching them at home and freaking out about it.”
“We're going to aim for feel-good classics in the Brattle vein,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: July 8, 2020, 6:40 p.m.
The Ivy League will not allow sports to resume during the fall semester due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The decision will mark an end to the fall sports season and could bar many winter and spring sport athletes from participation in usual preseason activities. It will also curtail the winter sports season, which ordinarily begins in November.
The eight Ivy League presidents said in a statement published Wednesday evening that their commitment to the health and wellbeing of student-athletes and staff guided their decision to halt the start of sports.
“With the information available to us today regarding the continued spread of the virus, we simply do not believe we can create and maintain an environment for intercollegiate athletic competition that meets our requirements for safety and acceptable levels of risk,” the announcement states.
The League’s decision dovetails with member universities’ individual plans for the fall semester, many of which put restrictions on university affiliates’ travel, impose social distancing requirements, and limit the number of students allowed on campus.
Though Cornell and the University of Pennsylvania invited all of their undergraduate students to campus, other Ivy League universities will prohibit significant chunks of their student bodies from being on campus in-person. On Monday, Harvard announced that 40 percent of undergraduates would be allowed to enter the University’s gates this fall.
Harvard football captain Jordan G. Hill ’21 said he was disappointed but not surprised by Wednesday’s announcement, given Harvard’s restrictive plans for the fall and the dire state of the pandemic in the United States.
Without fall sports, there will be no annual Harvard-Yale football game this fall. Slated to occur in Cambridge this year, the Game was last canceled during World War II.
Still, Hill said he is telling his teammates to remain optimistic that they will return to the gridiron in the spring for a modified season if the health crisis improves. In its announcement, the League stated that it would decide at a subsequent date whether fall sports teams could compete in the spring.
“Control what you can control. And this is out of our control. We can’t really do much about it. Just on your day-to-day, keep working as if the season will come back eventually,” Hill said he told his teammates. “I think that there’s potential for us to be playing in the spring.”
Wednesday’s decision makes the Ivy League the first collegiate body to stake out a decisive position regarding fall athletics.
Four months ago, the Ivy League canceled spring sports in early March as a result of the then-nascent coronavirus crisis — becoming the first sports league in the country to do so. That decision both prevented winter athletes from competing in postseason events and cut short the spring sports season.
While fall athletes will bear the brunt of Wednesday’s decision, teams that compete in the winter and spring seasons will also be impacted. The League said it will issue guidelines for student-athletes and coaches to train and practice with each other in accordance with university and state-wide guidelines, including small group workouts and practice sessions.
Though Hill acknowledged he does not have any say in whether the Ivy League will allow football to return in the spring, he said he believes Wednesday’s decision might convince people not heeding public health guidance to alter their behavior.
“Maybe this will change their perspective a little bit,” he said. “I feel like for those of us who aren’t doing it, or who haven’t been doing it, this is just another way to see how your actions are going to have a detrimental effect on the things that you want to do.”

Harvard Business School will offer a hybrid of in-person and online instruction during the fall semester and will welcome all its MBA students back to its residence halls.
The decision makes the Business School one of only two of Harvard’s 12 degree-granting schools that has opted for in-person instruction.
Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria and Executive Dean for Administration Angela Q. Crispi announced the plan in a message to Business School affiliates July 1.
“For many of our students, Boston is their preferred (or only) place of residence while attending the Doctoral and MBA Programs. Given the number of students we anticipate living at or near the School, and the inevitability of campus activity (much as we experienced in the spring semester), we believe it is better to manage and channel these flows of people through our spaces,” Nohria and Crispi wrote.
Nohria and Crispi noted that “in-person instruction is key” to protecting the school’s many international students’ visa statuses. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced Monday that it will force students enrolled in online-only programs to either transfer to an institution offering in-person classes or leave the country. Harvard and MIT sued ICE over that rule Wednesday morning.
Courses will start online then transition to a hybrid curriculum, Nohria and Crispi wrote. Students will have the option to complete their coursework entirely remotely. Similarly, faculty will be able to elect to teach entirely online.
“We think the bonds you will form with one another and in sections will be strongest if everyone shares the same initial experiences, and that is best accomplished online,” they wrote.
The school will also allow students to the Business School’s residence halls, where they will live in single-occupancy suites with their own bathrooms.
HBS will require students adhere to a “Campus Access Protocol” and sign a community contract enforcing practices like social distancing and face coverings in public spaces. Students will also be required to submit to testing at least once a week and to monitor and report their symptoms using the University’s “Crimson Clear” app.
Nohria and Crispi underscored the potential health consequences of COVID-19 in their message.
“To our students, in particular, we must be forthright: if you want in-person classes, you will need to follow these guidelines. Though you may be in a demographic group where you feel the risk of contracting or falling seriously ill from COVID-19 is low, many members of our community have identified concerns—for themselves or a family member—that make contracting the virus of particular concern to them. You must respect that,” Nohria and Crispi wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A lawsuit Harvard and MIT filed against the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Wednesday is a major step into existing legal battles over immigration and executive action, experts say.
The suit is centered on the Administrative Procedure Act, a law specifying the process federal agencies must follow when they create and issue regulations that has been at the heart of two recent Supreme Court cases.
Its first and second counts allege that the new rules — which bar international students attending colleges and universities offering online-only courses from residing in the United States were “arbitrary and capricious” because they failed to “consider important aspects of the problem” and failed to “offer any reasoned basis that could justify the policy.”
City University of New York Law School Professor Natalie M. Gomez-Velez said legal precedent requires an agency to “examine relevant data” and “articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made” in order to prove it acted within reason.
Gomez-Velez said she believes that DHS and ICE failed to do so when it announced the policy.
“The pandemic is still going on, and we're actually at a really critical point. There doesn't seem to be any rationale for changing direction with respect to those temporary exemptions,” she said. “What's a reasonable explanation for doing this? I haven't heard one.”
The universities’ third count asserts that the directive violates the requirement to provide a notice and comment period prior to rulemaking.
Gomez-Velez said she agrees that the guidance also “directly violates” the APA’s notice and comment requirement — and though there are exceptions, such as emergencies or “good cause,” she said she thinks they do not apply.
University of Chicago Law School Professor Jennifer Nou wrote in an email that the lawsuit’s claims are the “bread-and-butter of APA-based lawsuits.”
However, Nou noted that a potential argument against the suit is that it was filed “too early,” since the guidelines issued on Monday were a “broadcast message” rather than a “final” agency action. The APA only applies to final actions.
“ICE will later publish a temporary final rule in the Federal Register, which will likely lay out the same policy,” Nou wrote. “It’s possible that the temporary final rule will contain more justification for the change than the broadcast message did; in that case, many of the current lawsuit’s arguments may have to be revised.”
Gomez-Velez agreed that DHS and ICE may question the validity of the suit based on the unofficial status of the guidelines, though she believes they should be subject to review.
“It looks like a final rule and it looks like the kind of rule that would be subject to judicial review,” she said, citing that it included “very specific dates and requirements for universities” and threatened students with removal from the country.
The case has been assigned to federal judge Allison D. Burroughs, who previously ruled on cases pertaining both to Harvard and to the Trump administration’s immigration policies.
In October 2019, Burroughs ruled in favor of Harvard in its ongoing affirmative action lawsuit against Students for Fair Admissions. Two years earlier, she ruled against President Donald Trump’s initial travel ban that barred citizens of predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States.
The lawsuit — which has since expanded to include Northeastern University and attracted attention from universities across the nation — seeks a temporary restraining order and both a preliminary and permanent halt to the new policy.
According to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a temporary restraining order may be issued without notice to ICE and is capped at 10 days, while a preliminary injunction requires notice and could last until the trial on the merits occurs.
The scope of the injunction, though, could also be in contention, creating an “uncertain situation” for the thousands of international students impacted.
“If they succeed in court in getting the preliminary injunction to stop the agency from doing this, a couple of other questions are around whether or not that injunction can be applied nationwide,” Gomez-Velez said. “If an injunction is issued by this court, whether there will be appeals, whether it goes all the way to the Supreme Court — what's the timeframe?”
In a 5-4 ruling last month, the Supreme Court blocked an attempt to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals on the grounds that the Trump administration failed to provide adequate reason to end the program. And in a 5-4 ruling in June 2019, the Supreme Court ruled that the Department of Commerce could not add a question about citizenship to the 2020 Census, again because it failed to meet criteria for reasoned decision-making.
Challenges to agency actions alleging violations of the Administrative Procedure Act have become increasingly common in the Trump era, in part because of the administration’s penchant for rapid and drastic action.
“It is one of many Administrative Procedure Act cases precisely because this administration has been engaging in the agency actions that are that are an about-face, or that introduce policies without real explanation, that really have an impact on people in ways that they really have failed to explain, or aren't supported by the facts,” Gomez-Velez said.
One downside to cases based on violations of the APA, though, is that even if the court rules against an agency, it can alter its procedures and take the action again, Gomez-Velez said.
“The downside of it is, if there is a determination that is arbitrary and capricious for failure to explain, the agency always could go back and explain,” she said. “Or for failure to go through and comment rulemaking, the agency can go back and go through notice and comment, and then move forward with the policy anyway.”
In fact, Trump is expected to employ that strategy later this week with a second attempt to end DACA.
Even without immediate or satisfactory legal resolution, though, Nou wrote that there may be other reasons Harvard and MIT filed the suit.
“For starters, the lawsuit has a lot of expressive value and raises many points that the public may not have otherwise known; for example, the magnitude of the burdens placed on international students, the value that international students have in the academic community and at large,” Nou wrote. “All of these points may help sway the court of popular opinion, which could result in political blowback for the White House.”

Documents from a lawsuit Harvard and MIT filed against immigration authorities on Wednesday reveal new details about the reasons behind the decision to continue instruction in an online-only format with just 40 percent of undergraduates back on campus in the fall.
Harvard announced the plan just before Immigration and Customs Enforcement released new rules — now challenged by the suit — that bar international students who take online-only courses in the fall from receiving visas or residing in the country.
University Provost Alan. M Garber ’76 wrote in a court declaration that his training as a physician helped in his advisory role for Harvard's decision, which he wrote was “made with the dual objectives of providing the best possible education to Harvard’s students while limiting the spread of COVID-19 among students, faculty, and staff.”
Garber, who declared he will testify to these matters if asked, explained that Harvard decided its plan to continue remote learning was the only “feasible” solution.
For example, he noted that the median age of Harvard’s faculty is over the age of 60, meaning they could be at higher risk for complications from the novel coronavirus. He also added that many staff members — including those in close contact with students like dining hall workers — could be at increased risk because they “live in communities where the rates of complication from infection of COVID-19 are highest.”
In the declaration, Garber also focused on the “difficult — if not impossible” logistics of halting the spread of the virus in lecture halls and classrooms.
“With respect to classrooms, we determined that it would be costly and time-prohibitive to install the necessary ventilation systems to prevent the spread of the virus, or to otherwise configure most classrooms to ensure safe distancing,” Garber wrote.
He also revealed that Harvard concluded it could only provide “quarantine and isolation capacity, with limited social distancing,” to 40 percent of undergraduates, and that it could likely not “prevent students from deviating from practices known to reduce the spread of COVID-19” — like wearing masks and social distancing — at a normal density.
Though the resulting move to conduct online-only instruction has since put the University’s international students in jeopardy, Garber wrote that administrators thought they were acting in the best interest of international students when they made their plans.
Garber noted the plans were informed by what administrators assumed would remain the federal guidance: on March 13, ICE issued an exemption that allowed students to remain in the country even if they were completing only online courses. At the time, the exception was said to be “in effect for the duration of the emergency.”
“Because a significant portion of Harvard’s undergraduate and graduate student community is comprised of international students, the ability of students who hold nonimmigrant student visas to continue their education at Harvard also played a key role in our decision-making process,” Garber wrote.
Since finding out about the change in federal policy on Monday, Harvard has not altered its fall plans. But with immediate condemnation from University President Lawrence S. Bacow and a lawsuit filed against ICE on Wednesday, administrators have made it clear that they malign the move.
Vice Provost for International Affairs Mark C. Elliott wrote in his declaration for the lawsuit that the guidelines could cause significantly fewer international students to enroll at the University, which he wrote is detrimental to Harvard.
“Harvard and its students benefit enormously from the participation of international students,” he wrote. “Indeed, many of Harvard’s curricular programs depend critically on the presence and diversity of international students.”
He pointed out that approximately 47 percent of Harvard Kennedy School students are international students, which he wrote brings “unique viewpoints about different approaches to governance and policy.”
The University will be financially harmed if international students do not enroll, Elliott added. Nearly 50 percent of Harvard Graduate School of Design is international, so “losing the tuition of even a portion of those students would be significant to GSD.”
Elliott also wrote about some of the potential challenges international students may face if they cannot return to campus, such as being drafted into their home country’s armed forces, abuse based on their sexual orientation, inadequate mental health resources, excessive costs, unreliable internet access, and time zone differences.
He also noted that while offering hybrid classes affords domestic students the ability to choose if they will expose themselves to COVID-19, they do not afford an equal choice to international students.
“Although a hybrid program might allow domestic students to select only online courses if they have health conditions that place them at a greater risk (or simply want to avoid the greater risk of infection that in-person instruction imposes), under the July 6 Directive, F-1 students are denied this agency,” Elliott wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: July 9, 2020, 12:19 p.m.
Authorities halted a Harvard-bound sophomore at the airport in Minsk, Belarus, lawyer and Harvard Corporation Fellow William F. “Bill” Lee ’72 said in a court hearing Thursday.
On Monday, the federal government released an order barring international students enrolled in universities offering online-only courses from staying in or entering the United States. Harvard had announced just hours before that all its courses will be virtual, a decision that renders its international students subject to deportation.
Yesterday morning, Harvard and MIT announced their plan to fight the order in court, filing a lawsuit in United States District Court in Boston against the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The suit demands a temporary restraining order, as well as preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent DHS and ICE from enforcing the new federal guidelines.
Judge Allison D. Burroughs convened a hearing Thursday morning on the motion for a preliminary injunction in federal court in Boston. Lee stressed the urgency of Harvard’s suit during the hearing, citing the Belarusian student’s failure to board his flight to the U.S.
This is not the first time Harvard has clashed with immigration officials over its students. Last August, U.S. officials deported Ismail B. Ajjawi ’23, a then-17-year-old Palestinian resident of Tyre, Lebanon, shortly after he arrived at Boston Logan International Airport at the start of his freshman year.
Before canceling Ajjawi’s visa, immigration officers allegedly subjected him to hours of questioning about his religion and religious practices in Lebanon — at one point leaving to search his phone and computer. After the search, the officer interrogated him about his friends’ social media activity, which expressed political points of view that opposed the U.S., though Ajjawi said he did not personally make any political posts.
Staff from both Harvard and AMIDEAST, a scholarship organization sponsoring Ajjawi’s education, worked with federal officials to bring Ajjawi to campus before classes began early September.
Experts at the time said Harvard’s reputation and University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s personal involvement likely played an essential role in ensuring he could matriculate on time for the fall 2019 semester.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane said Harvard is committed to supporting the student under the “normal processes” it used to support Ajjawi last year.
Correction: July 13, 2020
At a hearing on Thursday, Harvard Corporation Fellow and lawyer William F. “Bill” Lee ’72 said the student who was stopped in Minsk, Belarus, was an incoming freshman. In fact, new documents filed on Monday revealed that the student is actually an incoming sophomore.

For most (if not all) of us, COVID-19 has thrown summer plans out the window. Instead of conducting research or eating pastries in Paris, maybe you’ve been scrolling through Tiktok for three hours at a time. Here are some ways to stay busy this summer!
Call, Email, Petition, Protest
Everyone should be doing this, regardless of how busy they are. Call and email your local representatives to support criminal justice reform and anti-racist legislation. Sign petitions and attend webinars and events hosted by organizations like Black Lives Matter and the ACLU. A list of events hosted by the ACLU can be found here.
Train for a Half-Marathon
Even though races may be indefinitely postponed, picking a goal and working toward it is a great way to keep up your motivation during these uncertain times. With the sun out and temperatures high, running is a great way to boost endorphins and soak up some Vitamin D, because — let’s be real — you haven’t gone outside in the past two days.
Start a Youtube Channel
If running isn’t your thing or it’s too hot to step outside, follow the lead of other Harvard students and start your very own vlogging channel! Leverage that sweet Harvard name, and if you’re lucky, you’ll make enough money to offset your internship that was cancelled because of coronavirus.
Tutor
Love children? Love money? Again, here’s another way you can use the Harvard name to get you some shmoney and keep your brain from atrophying over the summer. It can also be a great volunteering opportunity and will distract you from the ever-vague emails about plans for the fall.
Stay Class-y
We’ve recommended Duolingo in the past, but if you’re looking for something a little more formal, both Yale and MIT have free courses and materials online, and mastering a new software is bound to be useful for padding your resume. You can even relive your freshman fall by taking CS50 this summer. Just be warned: There isn’t a free shirt when you’re done.
You may not be in Italy, but we hope you have found ways to stay busy this summer. And if all else fails, staying socially distanced is always a safe bet!
