When The Hasty Pudding calls Saul, he answers.
On the evening of Feb. 2, the centuries-old theater troupe officially deemed actor Bob Odenkirk — best known for his role as Saul Goodman in “Breaking Bad” and “Better Call Saul” — as the 2023 Man of the Year. Each year, The Hasty Pudding awards the honors of Man and Woman of the Year to “performers who have made lasting and impressive contributions to the world of entertainment.” Odenkirk’s Woman of the Year counterpart, Jennifer Coolidge, was celebrated in a separate ceremony on Feb. 4. Both celebrations mark the start of Hasty Pudding’s 174th production titled “Cosmic Relief,” which runs until March 5 at Farkas Hall.
The night’s festivities began with a light-hearted roast of the award-winning actor, led by Lyndsey R. Mugford ‘23 and Nikita Nair ‘24, the President and Cast Vice President of “Cosmic Relief,” respectively. The roast started off with both students poking fun at Odenkirk for failing to secure an Emmy or Golden Globe award for playing Saul Goodman, a point of much contention within the “Breaking Bad” fandom.
After the roasters launched a few more playful insults at Odenkirk, they made him change into an ill-fitting pink dress. Once adorned, the show continued to take far whackier turns. Hearkening back to Odenkirk’s time as a writer on “Saturday Night Live,” the Hasty Pudding Theatricals tested his cue card reading skills, cleverly tricking the actor into reading lines that mocked his thinning hair. The most memorable moment of the night was when one roaster brought out a parody “Butter Call Saul” poster and made the actor stick his hands into a large pan of butter.
The roast was not completely one-sided, however, as Odenkirk was able to sneak in a few jabs at Harvard during his comedic acceptance speech. The audience burst into laughter when Odenkirk pretended to be reading his notes in the margins of the speech, reminding himself of the high stakes of the moment by exclaiming, “It’s Harvard! They pay $1,000 to go here!”
At a press conference following the roast, Odenkirk made it known that he took no offense to the jokes made at his expense. “It was so not brutal. I’m so aware of the thinningness of my hair,” Odenkirk said.
The Harvard Crimson asked the actor about his upcoming projects and whether or not he plans on returning to comedy after recently ending his dramatic tenure as Saul Goodman. Odenkirk called attention to his upcoming television series “Lucky Hank,” which premieres on AMC on March 19 and is co-written by Aaron R. Zelman ‘95. “It’s a comedy and it’s one of the reasons I wanted to do it was because it’s lighter, way more comedy than 'Better Call Saul,’ which was very funny at times. But Saul wasn’t kind of in on the joke, he was the joke,” said Odenkirk.
After the remainder of the press conference, during which Odenkirk fielded questions about his recent heart attack and sources of motivation as an actor, he and the rest of the crowd in Farkas Hall were shown a brief preview of “Cosmic Relief.”
Overall, Odenkirk seemed to enjoy his celebratory trip to Cambridge, sharing that the event was “really fun” before triumphantly kissing his newly awarded pudding pot. That kiss, however, came shortly after Odenkirk was truly initiated as Man of the Year in iconic Hasty Pudding fashion: with a kiss on both cheeks from Maureen Clare ‘23-‘24 and Jacob K. Ostfeld ‘23, a writer and a cast member of “Cosmic Relief,” respectively.

Harvard Art Museums’ “A World Within Reach: Greek and Roman Art from the Loeb Collection” debuted Jan. 28 providing a fresh perspective of ancient worlds to the Harvard community for the spring season.
The exhibit displays over 60 Greek and Roman artifacts from the collection of James Loeb, Class of 1888. In carrying out Loeb’s vision of broadening modern perspectives through ancience collections, Munich’s Staatliche Antikensammlungen und Glyptothek shared the collection with the Harvard Art Museums.
Loeb’s belief in the power of small figurines to enlarge viewpoints drives the exhibit’s approachable tone. Absent are the daunting friezes or imposing stone sculptures often conjured by the word ‘antiquity’ — rather, in their place are manifestations of culture and human concern small enough to hold in one’s hand. The new exhibit places the world of ancient Greece and Rome into the imaginations of modern museum-goers, favoring humble, welcoming looks at what it meant to live in the Mediterranean basin several thousand years ago. From wearable pieces to humorous animal figurines, the objects on display narrate the human experience and form endearing connections between their modern and early viewers.
“A World Within Reach” is organized along themes of human motivations — power, desire, wonder — drawing back the curtains of time to illuminate the experiences of people of antiquity. Visitors are empowered to marvel at the world through the eyes of ancient citizens, examining feminine desire in female figurines, identity and power through mythological characters, and the wonder of the natural world within the carved flora and fauna.
These artifacts — set at eye level — greet visitors immediately upon entry. Displays placed at varied angles disrupt sight lines across the gallery, impeding a formalized, disengaged path through the space. Instead, visitors flow through the gallery along a meandering path of discovery, circling around displays to confront the objects from all angles.
Several works urge visitors to further contemplate views of the pieces across time. Six pieces are accompanied by both their 20th-century catalogue entries and contemporary commentaries — a nod to the format of the Loeb Classical Library, which rendered ancient literature publicly accessible with ancient texts side-by-side to their modern translations. Preserving Loeb’s legacy in providing accessible connections to the past, the displays point to dynamic, living stories of the artifacts and artists.
By shedding the stiff formalities often associated with curated antiquity, the gallery places modern viewers in familiar conversation with viewers from 2,000 years ago in the language of their surviving art. The resulting exhibit opts for an intimate modern view into the human concerns of the objects’ early viewers, rather than a reverence for curated time pieces.
Cambridge students’ own contemporary dialogues with Greek and Roman artifacts are incorporated as an audio-visual supplement to the gallery space. As visitors marvel at the items on display, looped student video submissions from Cambridge Community Television’s 2022–23 School Year Production Program expand on connections to antiquity through relevant objects of Harvard’s collections.
Gallery visitors and local students alike are emboldened to imagine the cultures of antiquity, perhaps recognizing themselves in displayed depictions of Roman human-animal bonds or through their reflections in the personal mirror of a Greek citizen. Harvard Art Museums’ 2023 spring exhibit establishes a welcome human-scale conversation between antiquity and modernity, chaperoning visitors on a field trip to an ancient world which is indeed within reach.
“A World Within Reach: Greek and Roman Art from the Loeb Collection” is on view through May 7 in the University Research Gallery.

Jacqueline Bublitz’s novel “Before You Knew My Name” is the harrowing tale of two wayward young women navigating personal struggles, difficult relationships, and new lives in New York City. The first woman, Alice Lee turns 18 and leaves behind a quiet, broken life in Wisconsin in favor of a fresh new start in the big city with only $600, a stolen camera, and the address of a room for rent. Next, Ruby Jones is a woman in her mid-thirties who has been strung along by an engaged man for too long, so she upends her old life in Australia and blazes a new trail for herself in New York. Unbeknownst to the two protagonists, they arrive in New York on the same stormy day and meet when Ruby finds Alice facedown by the water in Riverside Park, murdered. A fun read with a unique twist on a true crime-like story, this novel ultimately spreads itself too thin with an ever-growing cast of ensemble characters.
The novel’s greatest success is the way in which it portrays how homicides affect those adjacent to the crime. Alice’s murder is a horrible act that shocks Manhattan, but only for a short time. The real trauma festers within the individuals who have to face those difficult memories every day. Ruby’s active choice to help unearth the life represented by the body she finds in the water that stormy morning ultimately allows her to discover who Alice is and what her life meant. The realization that a young life was unnecessarily snubbed leaves her in shock, propelling the story forward as she works to change the ways these violent crimes are viewed.
The story is told from the perspective of the spectral embodiment of Alice, who slowly informs the reader about the struggles of her life before New York. However, Alice’s ghostly interjections often come as a surprise to the reader. But because the most rich and vibrant storytelling happens not in the story’s present but in Alice’s reflections, Ruby’s day-to-day actions detract from the intrigue of the narrative. Bublitz enticingly teases hints of Alice’s past life before she indulges and shares her full story. As a result, Ruby’s seemingly incessant running to cope with finding Alice’s body redirects attention away from unearthing Alice’s mysterious past in Wisconsin.
Ultimately, Bublitz’s novel intentionally shifts the narrative surrounding cold-blooded murders away from the perpetrator to the victim. By telling the story from the perspective of the two women caught up in this violent act, Bublitz strips the power away from the murderer. In “Before You Knew My Name,” Alice is found with no identification and no connections to the city. She is just one more Jane Doe in need of help from overburdened homicide units. The victims of these crimes are far too often perceived simply as nameless bodies rather than people with rich lives stolen from them, but Ruby insists on maintaining Alice’s humanity while solving the mystery behind her disappearance. This purposeful emboldening of the victim provides a powerful piece of commentary on the increasing popularity of the true crime genre.
At its core, “Before You Knew My Name” is an entertaining and enjoyable read, but during the middle of the story, it loses a bit of its charm as Bublitz struggles to flesh out its side characters. One of the most mysterious and exciting characters is the man Alice rents her room from in New York, yet there is very little divulged about what makes him interesting. Similarly, Ruby opportunely meets a rag-tag gang of friends who have struggled with grief themselves, but these characters don’t evolve.
The only character arc that provides a meaningful, cathartic end is Ruby’s. But while Bublitz does such a wonderful job introducing so many rich characters, it’s simply not enough to have them reduced to one-dimensional individuals. Without evolving themselves, they can only propel the story so far.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is little media that has played as central of a role in the queer community as “The L Word.” The original series, which aired on Showtime from 2004 to 2009, followed a group of fictional sapphic women in Los Angeles as they lived lives of “Talking, laughing, loving, breathing / Fighting, f*cking, crying, drinking / Riding, winning, losing, cheating / Kissing, thinking, dreaming” (as the iconic theme song lists). “The L Word” was certainly far from perfect and some of its content has been rightfully critiqued for its harmful character portrayals. Still, the series was absolutely groundbreaking in its willingness to loudly and proudly tell BGLTQ stories in the early 2000s during a time of virtually nonexistent TV representation, and for that it holds a deeply special place in the hearts of many — particularly queer woman-identifying — viewers.
It is no surprise then, that news of a “The L Word” reboot premiering in 2019 was quite well received. Titled “The L Word: Generation Q” (also known as “Gen Q”), the new series was set to take place ten years after the end of the original show and featured the return of three favorite characters played by their original actresses (Jennifer Beals as Bette Porter, Leisha Hailey as Alice Pieszecki, and Katherine Moennig as Shane McCutcheon) along with a variety of new faces. Seasons one and two performed quite well: they resumed Bette, Alice, and Shane’s stories in ways that felt natural to the characters, introduced several interesting new plotlines, and notably diversified its cast. It is too bad, then, that season three of the series brought on a rapid quality devolution. What remains is a shoddy construction that can barely hold itself together, let alone live up to the standards set by its predecessor.
Poor show writing lies at the core of the issues plaguing season three. Underdeveloped plotlines run amok, ranging from Sophie (played by Rosanny Zayas) and Sarah Finley’s (known as “Finley” and portrayed by Jacqueline Toboni) frustrating on-again, off-again relationship, Bette and Tina’s (Laurel Holloman) rushed reunion, their daughter Angie’s (Jordan Hull) relationship with her professor, or the tired trope of Shane’s unfaithfulness. Not to mention the odd story arc in episode five where Angie helps to remove a condom from inside her roommate, or Shane and Finley’s construction zone dancing/grinding scenes. There are many ways to convey a sense of levity in a television show, but these two are certainly not among them. And where the show tries to capitalize on a shock factor by arresting Dani (Arienne Mandi) for involvement with her father’s white collar crimes, placing GiGi (Sepideh Moafi) in a car accident, or having Carrie (Rosie O’Donnell) suffer from a heart attack, it promptly self-sabotages by revealing that all becomes resolved (in the preview for the next episode, no less). Room for imagination, speculation, or suspense is absolutely nonexistent.
In any case, the stories that do get more screen time tend to be those of generally unlikeable characters. Perhaps if Finley did not act like an irresponsible child who never learns from her own actions, then fans would actually feel invested in her and Sophie’s relationship drama. Though not quite to the same extent of insufferability, Micah (Leo Sheng) and Maribel (Jillian Mercado) are another example of a romantic pair that is difficult to care about — mainly because Maribel’s character often acts irrationally, impulsively, and without consideration of others. On the other hand, the writers took a popular romance between fan-favorites Dani and GiGi and nixed it completely in one episode with minimal explanation. Well-loved character GiGi (Sepideh Moafi) was never to be seen or heard from on screen again.
This points to the larger problem of a lack of relationship continuity in “The L Word: Gen Q.” Hookups, one night stands, cheating, and a variety of sexual escapades are a hallmark of the original “The L Word.” The difference between the OG show and “Gen Q,” however, is that the latter only includes such short-term relationships, whereas the original series complemented its more promiscuous plotlines with lovable long term relationship endeavors that lasted for at least a couple of seasons, including Tina and Bette (TiBette), Alice and Dana, or Alice and Tasha (R.I.P. Dana). “Gen Q” thus far has seen so many cheating and fleeting hookup plotlines that any new love interests introduced feel impermanent and thus fail to demand any real investment from the viewer. Adding insult to injury, “Gen Q” does not even let its characters use their relationship-free status as opportunities to work on themselves; where the show lacks lovable couples for fans to root for and “ship,” it also feels like it does not allow its (endearingly) flawed characters to learn from their mistakes and grow as individuals, either.
The only real highlight of this season was the rekindled connection between Bette and Tina and their eventual wedding in the season finale. Already having experienced a multitude of relationship highs and lows throughout the original “The L Word” and finally ending the series as what appeared to be a long-term couple, it was disappointing for TiBette fans to see the two begin the reboot as divorcees. Season three redeems this arc, with episode two featuring what is perhaps the highlight of the season, with Bette dramatically professing her love and commitment to Tina amidst standstill LA traffic. In fact, this sequence is probably the only one in season three that felt just right. Bette is one of the only characters who experienced significant — though rushed — personal growth in “Gen Q,” making her and Tina’s reconciliation actually seem believable. The season concludes with their wedding and thus also a massive sense of catharsis for long-time TiBette fans.
As one of the most iconic gay couples on TV to date, witnessing their nuptials was also something of a historic cultural moment. It seems, however, that show writers succumbed with reluctance to fan demands with regards to TiBette: The women barely had any screen time at their own wedding, the final episode focused disproportionately on the shenanigans of other characters (Why is Dani rolling on molly the whole time?), and more certainly could have been done to honor the history, impact, and legacy of their relationship. But as the saying goes, “a win is a win,” and seeing Bette and Tina finally get their happily ever after is a victory by any standard.
A final critique lies in the character of the show itself. The original “The L Word” was known and loved for its portrayal of drama, yes, but also the friendship and community these women cultivated amongst themselves. In fact, some of the most enjoyable moments from the original series are where all the characters gather at the local gay coffee shop/night club called “The Planet” and simply banter or debrief recent life occurrences. And whenever a crisis struck, any ongoing conflicts were immediately forgotten in favor of everyone rushing to support the woman that needed it. Unfortunately, “Gen Q” just does not capture this same spirit of queer love and camaraderie. Sure, it has events held at the local gay bar and all the characters are intertwined in some way, but they simply do not form a unit in the same way as their predecessors did. “Gen Q” feels more like it tells parallel stories of characters that know each other to some extent, rather than the story of a friend group that would follow each other to the ends of the earth.
Given all these critiques, it would be unfair to the series to not also mention its upsides. It is special simply for existing: There are virtually no other shows about the lives of all queer characters, especially queer women. Actresses Jennifer Beals, Leisha Hailey, and Kate Moennig can be thanked for this, as they fought hard to revive “The L Word” after realizing that no other series filled the space left behind by the OG series following its conclusion. Working with original airing platform, Showtime, in addition to consulting with OG writer Ilene Chaiken before passing the showrunning torch to “Gen Q”’s Marja-Lewis Ryan, the reboot truly had a lot of potential. It is aesthetically pleasant to watch, has high production quality, and features a score of hard hitting queer guest stars including Fletcher, Margaret Cho, Kehlani, Chrishell Stause and G Flip, and Rosie O’Donnell as Tina’s ex, Carrie. It is also impressive that so many original actors return for the series, of course including Beals, Hailey, and Moennig, but also Laurel Holloman as Tina, Daniel Sea as Max Sweeney, and Rose Rollins as Tasha Williams.
This is all to say that as imperfect as the show is, it is still worth a watch if only for its strong and diverse queer representation. Unfortunately, its future is looking pretty bleak. One glance at Twitter under the hashtag #thelwordgenq quickly reveals discontent among fans, and the series still has not been renewed. Without Bette and Tina (presumably, since they seem to be making a permanent move to Toronto), the show also loses one of the only pillars currently holding it up. This is not to say that the series is unsalvageable, because it very much is. The foundation and concept are more than solid, but the real question lies in whether the writers and showrunners take viewer critiques seriously and produce the wonderful show that is possible, or if they will continue as they are until “The L Word: Generation Q” simply is no more.

Precipitated by the passing of my abuelita Isabela Ortiza, the following pieces explore themes of death, memory, and new beginnings. In recreating her wedding portrait, I sought to memorialize my grandmother and reflect on the natural progression of life. I employed a similar method of coping to analyze and explore my family’s spiritual beliefs by creating a ceramic interpretation of the Fall of Man.
I created this rendition of my grandparents’ wedding portrait as a tribute and celebration of their lives. The title — “reunited”— references my family’s beliefs about death: that heaven exists and that my abuelito and abuelita are now together once more and embarking on a new journey.
The flaky golden beams around the circle represent their burning love and exuberant spirit, roughly resembling the sun's rays. The interconnected golden hearts — a reference to Kahlo’s “Las dos Fridas” — represent their undying love and connection, implying a continued purpose and life while hinting at their Mexican nationality. Flowers and a thin white ring surround both figures, symbolizing the circle of life, as well as the fragility of my grandmother’s physical state toward her life's end.
My family often found solace in Catholic motifs and sayings in the aftermath of my grandmother’s passing. But where does that sense of comfort come from? What parallels are there between the end of life on Earth and of that described in the Bible? Surrounded by these religious remarks, I created a double incense holder (as incense sticks have traditionally symbolized a sacred form of connection) that makes reference to the Fall and the intricacies of man, as well as the connection between endings and new beginnings. It has two main physical components: Satan in his serpent form holding a backflow cone in his mouth and Adam holding up the incense stick in the ashtray of the serpent’s coil. Although its physical composition clearly has religious overtones, it also touches on broad universal themes of human nature and discontinuation, ultimately leaving its true meaning up to the interpretation of the viewer.

Syros’s favorite part of his day was going to the gym. The whole process, from sitting on the bus while making his dishwater-looking protein-water mixture, to listening to his hype playlist, to setting up for a superset. He thought of absolutely nothing and said absolutely nothing as he pushed and pulled more and more weight. When fatigued and sweating profusely, cool lemon water tasted like it was heaven-sent. Sitting on the bench in front of a dust-covered fan felt like an ocean breeze. He was present and experiencing every moment to its fullest. He was alive. The seconds were minutes and the minutes were hours when gripping the bar, muscles on the brink of collapse. He could live forever. Entire eternities passed while his body pressed and pressed. He appreciated the entire experience, especially that it was entirely his own. There was no one to ruin it. I thought he looked pretty cool too — like a superhero, saving damsels and catching buildings.
Most of all, he liked the way the gym made him feel — powerful and worthy. He felt worthy when someone would notice him growing and compliment him; when someone assumed he was on a sports team; when Mom asked him to move her heavy packages around the house for her. It validated all the time he spent there — time that Dad believed would be better spent on studies. Dad resented that, for all his son’s strength, Syros was not actually on any sports team. His muscles did nothing but take up space and consume copious amounts of food. Without a team, his pecs and delts wouldn’t be getting him into any schools. Wasted potential. Wasted space. Wasted time.
Syros didn’t like the sports at his school and wasn’t close friends with any athletes, and he didn’t want to be. He didn’t want to be compared to everyone in his weight class, selected (or not selected) to start the game, or forced to wake up at five a.m. to run a circuit. He didn’t want one of the few things he truly liked (or dare I say, loved) in his life to become a chore.
He used to like drawing and painting, before Mom — excited to build on his talent — put him in art classes. The instructor was a pain, let me tell you. Her name was Mrs. Tomoe and that woman sucked the life out of me. Or us. Everything I did seemed to be just one or two steps away from good enough. Eventually, Syros stopped drawing. The same thing happened with guitar classes and soccer and the rest. He didn’t like teachers; he didn’t like being forced to do something; he didn’t like the due dates or the shows or anything. Once they became responsibilities, they didn’t make him happy anymore. Applying himself just killed the fun. Syros only liked to do things for himself.
I understood where he was coming from, but I was really upset when Syros sold all of our pens and paints. A part of my soul went with them. I sat on the floor for months, while Syros sat in his bed. Doing absolutely nothing. Thinking absolutely nothing.
Because of allergy to instruction, Syros didn’t do much of anything in school either — the place where he was supposed to prove his worth to schools and colleges and his parents and his peers and everyone. He was scared to taint the beautiful things in life with the toxic nature of performance and competition. But he also had a terrible fear of failure instilled in him. Fear that he wouldn’t go anywhere after school ended — and that he wouldn’t go to college or get a good job. Fear that he’d be stuck dealing with Dad’s disappointment and Mom’s sadness. Fear that he’d eventually be forced to stop doing things he loved in order to make a living for 40+ hours a week, and hate every second of it. He believed it was already too late. He was a sophomore in high school, which doesn’t sound too late, but certainly feels that way when everyone else has already started their internships and leadership positions and extracurriculars. How the heck did they do it all? Didn’t they hate it? Didn’t being forced to do it ruin whatever it was they liked about their hobbies and dedications? How did they keep doing it? How could you NOT hate it?
He felt sick about the whole thing. Do something you love and ruin it forever? Or do something you don’t and hate everyday anyways? How could they force him to choose? Damn it all, he decided. If all the options sucked, he might as well milk as much as he could from the present. He would lap up the security of his adolescence and his parent’s provisions until he couldn’t, and then he’d bide his time until a golden seed fell from the sky to save him. He’d plant it and grow a beanstalk and climb up to live with the giants, never to return again. Damn it all.
I couldn’t say he was wrong in all this. But I hated to see the hope drained from his body. He was a prisoner to his convictions and, seeing no light at the end of the tunnel of youth, he was permanently gray. He simply lived in some dismal version of the future that he had (with some degree of realistic insight) conjured up.
We lived for those couple of hours of the day at the gym. He escaped from the darkness in his mind and I got to be a superhero for a bit. We flew. And then he hibernated until the next 24 hours had passed, and I hibernated along with him. I was his prisoner, marching alongside him from class to home to gym and back, waiting for him to look up and find the sun.

Fans flocked to Boston’s Roadrunner on Jan. 28 for Gregory Alan Isakov’s latest stop on his much anticipated nationwide tour. The South African singer-songwriter was joined on stage by a five-piece band featuring guitarists Steve Varney and Danny Black, violinist Jeb Bows, bassist John Paul Grigsby, and drummer Max Barcelow. The anticipation in the audience was palpable as Isakov, sporting a casual outfit and a brown brimmed hat, walked onto the darkened stage with his guitar.
Isakov kicked off the evening with “Southern Star,” a song off of his most recent album, 2018’s “Evening Machines.”
“It’s so damn good to be here,” he said as he proceeded to play “Dark, Dark, Dark,” which he referred to as his “only happy song.” He followed up the somber track with fan favorite “San Luis,” both featured on “Evening Machines.” The interaction between Isakov and the audience during these songs set a spirited tone for the rest of the evening, as Isakov engaged the audience with call and response.
The colorful flashing spotlights on stage brought the venue to life as Isakov continued his set, incorporating songs from his older albums — 2016’s “Gregory Alan Isakov with the Colorado Symphony,” 2013’s “The Weatherman,” and 2009’s “This Empty Northern Hemisphere.” Chills swept through the audience as Isakov performed “Liars,” repeating the phrase “now we’re just liars” with a soaring vocal and instrumental background.
One unforgettable moment from the evening came as Isakov introduced his band-mates, recounting how he and guitarist Danny Black had been in a band together when they were twelve years old. The audience could be heard aww-ing as the two reminisced about their shared childhood.
The stage lights dimmed as Isakov switched to a lower energy for the end of his set, playing acoustic-heavy songs like “Big Black Car,” “Amsterdam,” “Virginia May,” and “Second Chances.” Couples and friends could be seen holding each other in the audience, swaying side to side as they absorbed Isakov’s captivating lyrics and melodies, singing “if it weren’t for second chances, we’d all be alone.”
Isakov also announced that he has a new record coming out later this year. He gave the audience a sneak peek with a performance of the unreleased “Appaloosa Bones.” The song was a hit with fans, who listened with full smiles and closed eyes, entranced by the softness of Isakov’s voice and guitar.
After finishing the set, Isakov and his band thanked the audience before wrapping up the set. However, with an audience desperate for more music, they returned to play “Dandelion Wine” and “Saint Valentine.” In the encore they performed the tracks huddled together around a single microphone while laughing and dancing.
As the initial encore concluded, Isakov and the band returned to the stage once more for a second encore, playing “All Shades of Blue” before leaving the stage for good. After many special moments, fans left satisfied and excited to hear what’s on the horizon for Gregory Alan Isakov.

Netflix Originals prides itself on its cultural relevance, star studded casts, and most importantly, ability to create a comfortable and accessible moviegoing experience. Kicking off Netflix’s 2023 releases is “Black-ish” creator Kenya Barris’s new romantic comedy “You People.” The film stars Jonah Hill, who co-wrote the movie, and Lauren London, as both try to deal with the challenges of an interracial relationship in polarized and neoliberal Los Angeles.
Hill plays Ezra Cohen, a 30-something Jewish investment banker from a wealthy family led by matriarch Shelley (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) and father Arnold (David Duchouveny). While hosting a podcast on the side with his African-American best friend Mo (Sam Jay), Ezra stumbles upon costume designer Amira (Lauren London), in a meet-cute Uber mix up.
The two begin dating and slowly realize that their family’s cultural differences are creating unexpected trouble, particularly as Amira’s father Akbar, played by comedic giant Eddie Murphy, holds deep reservations about his daughter dating a white man. Murphy’s comedic talents shine as he torments Ezra, adding another layer to the protective father trope. While Ezra and Amira’s relationship is depicted mostly through montages, their chemistry is still palpable. They may not be the traditional rom-com protagonists, but their representation is nonetheless a valuable demonstration of the multitudes of love.
While “You People” makes an earnest attempt to connect with audiences, its exaggerated dialogue leaves little room for watchers to interpret the challenges of today’s racial landscape, and instead muddles the many nuances of cross-cultural families. When reaching for humor and relatability, it instead showcases the niche privileges of white families and fails to reshape the viewer’s perspective.
Nevertheless Louis-Dreyfus clarifies the film and shines in her character’s cycle of rejection and acceptance in neoliberal soon-to-be-interracial families. The cultural quips are on point, from singing “Rise Up” by Andra Day to an accented pronunciation of Amira’s name, Hill and Barris depict the archetype of white women unique to the past two decades, highlighting the hypocrisies of overeducation and simultaneous ignorance.
“You People”’s largest limitation is the writing — as it categorizes itself as a movie about racism. The movie tells, rather than accurately illustrates, the nuances of the long-lasting impact historical events such as the Holocaust and the period of the trans-atlantic slave trade can have on the Jewish and Black community, instead reducing the topic to an awkward family dinner. Even some of Murphy’s jokes centered around gang relations in Los Angeles, like wearing red in a Crip barbershop, is a representation of the deep divestment from the Black communities of California and the structural issues that limit the communities upward mobility, these should not be punchlines.
What specifically hinders “You People”’s cultural commentary is its choice to try to address the cultural tensions between Black and Jewish communities' oppression narratives. Barris and Hill tried to put their heads together, but to have a film about racism’s denouement include “I will never understand what it’s like to be a Black person in this country… but…” indicates that the writers have not been intentional enough about what conclusions they want the audience to draw.
This is most evident in relationship dynamics between the parents and their children’s partners. The film treats Akbar’s protective nature toward Ezra as equivalent to that of Shelley’s racist comments and inappropriate microaggressions toward Amira. This creates a “reverse racism” false equivalency, which is a particularly dangerous mechanism to diminish the struggles Amira faced throughout the relationship.
Movies about racism need to be intentional and it is unclear whether Hill and Barris were confident in the impact “You People” could have. The film will likely start conversations in homes that have turned a blind eye to injustice, but will be unable to finish them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Jan. 13, Miley Cyrus released “Flowers,” the debut single from her upcoming eighth studio album, “Endless Summer Vacation.” As of Jan. 19, the track had become the most-streamed song in a single week in Spotify history. The music video for “Flowers,” directed by Jacob Bixenman, is jovial, empowering, and full of digs at her ex-husband Liam Hemsworth — whose birthday coincided with the date of the release.
As the video opens, Cyrus is seen walking down a sidewalk in a vintage gold Yves Saint Laurent dress. Fans couldn’t help but notice that the stunning wardrobe piece happens to be quite similar to a dress that Jennifer Lawrence wore to the 2012 Los Angeles Premiere of “The Hunger Games.” Cyrus’s former husband notably played the love interest for Lawrence’s character in the movie.
Though Cyrus previously denied the rumors of cheating in 2019, Lawrence’s comments about kissing Hemsworth outside the realm of their work, in combination with the similar dress, re-ignited fan speculation of cheating rumors.
Right off the bat, the lyrics make clear reference to Cyrus’s previous marriage, stating; “We were right ‘til we weren’t / built a home then watched it burn.” Cyrus and Hemswoth shared a home in Malibu, which was destroyed in 2018 by the wildfires that wrought the area. As the chorus starts, Cyrus takes off her gold hood, puts her hair up, and begins to dance. Freed of a burdensome relationship, she emphatically states that she can provide for herself without it.
The lyrics of the chorus, “I can buy my own flowers” appear to respond to the 2012 Bruno Mars song, “When I Was Your Man.” Perhaps this suggests a changed mindset about her previous relationship. Rather than wondering if a former lover wishes things ended up differently, Cyrus reasserts herself as the maker of her own destiny.
As Cyrus sings about being able to fulfill her own needs, she removes her dress, and wades through sprinklers, before jumping into a swimming pool to wash the stress of her past away. After taking a dip in the pool, Cyrus proceeds to perform an extensive workout routine. As she pushes her body to perform, it is clear that the routine represents rediscovering her inner strength.“Flowers” asserts its status as an empowerment anthem as Cyrus sheds the burden of her past.
In the final minute of the music video, Cyrus dawns a black suit jacket and pants, while dancing sporadically. Fans were quick to draw comparisons to the scene in which Joaquin Phoenix dances down the stairs in “Joker” (2019). While some fans speculated that this is due to Hemsworth’s affinity for the movie, others have suggested that it could be a reflection of Cyrus’s mental health. Ultimately, “Joker” was famously isolated and the visual similarity may suggest that Cyrus has mixed feelings about her lack of relationship.
Moreover, the choice of the black suit may be another subtle dig at Hemsworth due to the similarities of the suit to one Hemsworth wore to the 2019 premiere of “Avengers: Endgame.” During the premiere, a video allegedly captured Hemsworth telling Cyrus to “behave for once” after she pretended to lick him. Though viewers argued whether the tone of the comment was playful or scornful, the couple nonetheless called it quits shortly after. People have speculated that by donning a similar suit, Cyrus could be using the video as a way to state that she can behave however she pleases.
While fans have continued to unpack a growing mountain of potential easter eggs, Cyrus has been tight- lipped. But with new music confirmed to be in the works for Cyrus, the music scene is poised to witness a new era for the pop star.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We here at the Crimson, by which I mean me, have not seen all of the 54 nominees for the 95th Academy Awards. I have seen a measly 17 of them. Still, I watched the announcement of the nominees on Jan. 24 with interest and hopes — some of which were met, and some of which were dashed. As happens in every transpiration of this annual cycle, there were snubs and there were surprises. Here I would like to expound on some of the more talked-about categories.
Best Picture
It was a surprise — though, if one gauged by the betting markets, only a slight one — to see “Triangle of Sadness” among the Best Picture nominees and “Babylon” left out. Though I have not seen “Triangle of Sadness,” I was saddened by “Babylon’s” exclusion. Damien Chazelle ’07’s telling of the rise of talking films divided critics and flopped at the box office. It is, admittedly, a bit of a monstrosity. Its three hours and nine minutes move forward with a relentless fury that makes the viewer feel like a cat in a clothes dryer. Yet I found it a masterpiece. It bursts with love and hate; it is intensely, recklessly, overwhelmed by a death drive; and yet it cannot conclude.
But enough sorrow. There is much to celebrate in the list of the nominees. “Everything Everywhere All at Once” was far from my favorite film of the year, but it was, strictly speaking, ours. If more films like it proliferate in years to come, their sentimentality and bloated humor will grow tired fast, but for now “Everything Everywhere” has clearly captured the attention of a generation that feels it finally sees itself onscreen. There is a storied place for such films in the history of cinema. The picture is not the first work to comment on how, in an age where most people are connected to the expanse of the internet most of the time, one finds oneself constantly aware of the vast multiplicity of that which is. As a friend put it to me, a senator gives a speech in Congress, and hours later there are hundreds of thousands of dramatically different renditions of the speech floating around on TikTok, from scathing, highly edited takedowns to autotuned songificiations to videos of aspiring and unaspiring musicians recording themselves harmonizing to autotuned songifications. “Everything Everywhere” makes that experience of being on the internet manifest. If, in the process, it also straightforwardly produces the effortful insipidness of that experience (butt plug–⁠powered martial artists; a bagel with literally everything on it), this is forgivable. We are happy to see such an aesthetically film make it to the Oscars in a big way. It is favored to win the award; it would not be this writer’s choice, but he will not object as he objected to “CODA’s” egregious victory last year.
As for the others: The inclusion of “All Quiet on the Western Front,” which we have not seen, bodes well for the future of non–⁠English language cinema at the Oscars. “Top Gun: Maverick” is a better if less sophisticated technological achievement than the behemoth “Avatar: The Way of Water.” “The Banshees of Inisherin” is unassuming, but severed fingers stay on the mind. Better that the Academy encourage a lack of restraint than suffocate it, even if “Elvis” goes too far. And I was relieved to see “Women Talking,” an unassuming, dialogic meditation on the dynamism of spoken conversation, make the cut.
My loyalties are divided as to what should win. I lean toward “TÁR,” an eerie near–⁠horror movie that Jamelle Bouie has excellently assessed as a meditation on “the perilously short distance between self-creation and self-delusion, and the danger of treating others as mere means to the end of one’s self-actualization.” But I have a soft spot for “The Fabelmans,” which more than previous Steven Spielberg–⁠Tony Kushner collaborations, synthesizes Spielbergian mythos with Kushnerian trenchancy. Fortunately, critics do not get to vote for the Academy Awards, and college newspaper critics do not get to vote for any awards; and thus I do not have to choose.
Best Actress
The controversy in this category is that two Black actresses who had been assumed to be locks for nominations, Viola Davis of “The Woman King” and Danielle Deadwyler of “Till,” were snubbed, with unexpected nominations for Ana de Armas (“Blonde”) and Andrea Riseborough (“To Leslie”). Since of those four movies I have only seen “The Woman King,” I won’t wade into the brouhaha here.
As for the others: I did not think Michelle Williams’s performance in “The Fabelmans” was a leading one and was not blown away by it; for me, this is a contest between Michelle Yeoh (“Everything Everywhere”) and Blanchett (“TÁR”). Not much of a contest, though: Blanchett’s performance will cast a long shadow in years to come. I liked Yeoh in “Everything Everywhere” and would be content to see her win; but it would be a mistake on the Academy’s part.
Best Actor
The Academy’s fetish for mimesis, especially in judging performances, is well-known for causing performances like Eddie Redmayne’s in “The Theory of Everything” — stale but precise — to win trophies. An underrated effect of this fetish, however, is to shut out performances that are great because they simply project a vibe. This is why Harrison Ford has only one acting nomination, and it’s for “Witness” instead of “Indiana Jones,” “Star Wars,” or “Blade Runner.”
Daniel Craig became famous in one “vibe role” — James Bond — and since 2019 has been making his name again in another. Benoit Blanc of the “Knives Out” films could not be more different from Bond, but Craig’s performances in both roles are for the ages. Someday he will play a very serious role as a politician or a mathematician, and he will win, and we will all know that he is actually winning for playing James Bond and Benoit Blanc. The Academy should have cut to the chase and awarded him now.
I would also like to have seen Diego Calva nominated for his work in “Babylon,” but likely winner Brendan Fraser brings gentility and even cheerfulness to a film (“The Whale”) that seems determined to stamp these qualities out. Colin Farrell (“Banshees”) and Austin Butler (“Elvis”) are each serviceable to their films’ overall moods. Bill Nighy, in “Living,” cannot live up to Takashi Shimura’s work in “Ikiru,” but no one could. I have not seen “Aftersun,” but Paul Mescal’s nomination is a win for independent cinema, and I generally celebrate such victories.
Best Supporting Actor
I have not seen “Causeway,” but I hear tell from certain Crimson film editors that Brian Tyree Henry’s performance, a surprise nominee, is excellent. Brendan Gleeson’s and Ke Huy Quan’s nominations for “Banshees” and “Everything Everywhere,” respectively, are as expected as they are welcome, as is Quan’s victory, which is generally supposed to be a sure thing. Paul Dano’s (“Fabelmans”) exclusion is decidedly unwelcome. Either Judd Hirsch (“Fabelmans”) or Barry Keoghan (“Banshees”) could have been jettisoned to make room for him. And I was sorry not to see my preferred winner, Jovan Adepo (“Babylon”), make the pack, but he was never expected to. One of these years!
Best Supporting Actress
In “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” Angela Bassett does not exude royalty quite as much as the late Chadwick Boseman did, but then Boseman’s was a once-in-a-generation presence. Bassett is still great, and I look forward to her victory. In this category, all the nominees were anticipated: In addition to Bassett, there are Hong Chau, for “The Whale;” Kerry Condon, for “Banshees;” and Jamie Lee Curtis and Stephanie Hsu, for “Everything Everywhere.” Condon, Curtis, and Hsu are all fine. “Women Talking” fell to the fate of many an ensemble piece before it — with so many award-worthy performances, voters could not coalesce around one — but I would have nominated both Jessie Buckley and Liv McNeil from among its cast. I would have also nominated Lee Jung-hyun, for “Decision to Leave.”
Odds; Ends
Every year there is some nominating decision that serves to indict the Academy of unseriousness. This year, that decision (or at least one of them) is the total exclusion of Park Chan-wook’s “Decision to Leave,” which should be up for Best Picture and Best Cinematography and possibly Best Director as well as a handful of acting trophies. That a Korean film should be unjustly excluded from these categories is no shock: Even after “Parasite,” the Academy remains an American institution. But for it to be excluded from Best International Feature? In a year when the paint-by-numbers historical drama “Argentina, 1985” has been nominated? If the Academy has enough going for it to have schande, this is a schande.
Finally, one of the greatest Oscars fumbles in history was the Academy’s failure even to nominate Public Enemy’s “Fight the Power,” from “Do the Right Thing,” for Best Original Song in 1989. (“Under the Sea,” from “The Little Mermaid,” won.) The suckers were simple and plain, but they have a chance, if not to redeem themselves, then to take a different tack, this year: The Academy seems to be poised to give the statuette to M. M. Keeravaani’s and Chandrabose’s “Naatu Naatu,” from “RRR.” “RRR'' should be up for a whole slew of prizes, but if it had gotten snubbed for Best Original Song, it would have been as if “Decision to Leave” had been snubbed for Best International Feature. We all sin and we all do good works; the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is no different. Hopefully, come March, it will do the best work it can with the nominations it has set before itself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I know, I know, another article about free speech on campus. But frankly, nearly every piece misses the mark. I think many agree that free speech is under threat at universities, but for the wrong reasons.
For the past decade, this ceaseless debate about free speech has primarily centered only on one question: Does campus discourse reflect an ideologically diverse, cordially cohabitating smorgasbord of perspectives?
This question, while important, only plays into the hands of conservative coalitions purportedly standing up for free speech. They protest left-wing “cancel culture” for silencing conservative voices. It’s time for the left to expose this hypocrisy for what it is: a smokescreen that obscures a far more pernicious threat to free speech — one that comes from the right, not the left.
And what is this threat? A nationwide culture war that systematically censors educators who dare to speak on subjects that conservative lawmakers deem off-limits. And unlike the threats to free speech from the left, these conservative weapons of war are actual laws that can result in loss of employment, prosecution, and even ultimately criminal penalties.
We need look no further than The Crimson to observe the ways in which conservatives couch their criticism of Harvard University in free speech rhetoric. Nearly two years ago, a columnist bemoaned that just three percent of the faculty is conservative, that Harvard is too ideologically homogeneous, and that student protests exclude valuable perspectives and run counter to Harvard’s mission to support the free exchange of ideas. More recently, The Crimson reported on a petition signed by nearly 250 Harvard affiliates urging the University’s Presidential Search Committee to replace former University President Lawrence S. Bacow with a candidate who protects “diversity of opinion” and makes University culture more tolerant of controversial conservative voices.
This is the wrong free speech conversation. Instead, we should focus on the slew of new laws designed to chill speech by keeping certain discussions out of the classroom — censorship par excellence. For example, in Florida, the Stop W.O.K.E. Act — W.O.K.E. standing for “Wrongs to our Kids and Employees” — signed into law last April prohibits professors from teaching anything that could make a student feel “psychological distress” on account of their race. In other words, professors who make students or colleagues uncomfortable in the classroom when discussing historical acts of racism may face the prospect of litigation.
Thankfully, a United States District Judge temporarily blocked the statute from taking effect on college campuses. But other instances of censorship are slipping through the cracks, at least so far. For example, the Idaho legislature banned public funds from being used to help students receive abortions. Professors at the University of Idaho, a state-funded institution, must therefore tread lightly. The university administration even sent out a memo urging faculty to refrain from advocating for the use of birth control and supporting abortion in any circumstance. Now, educators can no longer advocate for abortion rights in a classroom setting, nor even provide advice to those seeking abortion services without fear of criminal prosecution.
These two examples are not isolated instances. Eighteen states have enacted some kind of rule preventing professors from discussing systemic racism and sexism. For a party that claims to support free and open discussion, the right has embraced a version of censorship far more extreme than the left’s hotly-debated, so-called “cancel culture.”
To be fair, conservative underrepresentation on college campuses might be a real problem. But it’s hard to even compare that concern with these dystopian laws. On the one hand, professors are fired and universities are sued for vast sums of money, whereas on the other, oftentimes there are only a few student protests and a brief clamor. Today, conservative lawmakers seek to bend the entirety of higher education to support their political agenda. Liberal activists call out professors for discrimination and write acerbic articles in the school newspaper. The two are just not the same.
Thankfully, such draconian legislation has so far left Harvard unscathed. But because students at similar Ivy League institutions are primarily in blue states, we remain insulated from the broader national problem. We fixate on the issue at close proximity — “cancel culture” on our own campus — and miss a more serious but not immediately evident free speech problem nationwide.
Widespread cultural censorship is very much looming on the horizon; it just isn’t coming from the left-leaning academy indoctrinating students with wokeness. The left must start exposing conservative doublespeak and understanding the right-wing crackdown for what it really is: the most dangerous threat to free speech on college campuses since the McCarthy era. Otherwise, laws akin to the ones passed in Florida and Idaho will begin to slip away, unnoticed, amidst the smokescreen of the political debate about cancel culture.
So the next time you read about the latest campus cancel culture controversy, keep in mind the professors in red states under gag orders. Let’s start talking about that free speech crisis.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I was fourteen years old, I found an older cousin’s iPod nano stashed away in an old basement room: a baby blue, perfectly-square brick of an MP3 player. Pushing the small, circular knob on its bottom to the right, I watched as a black Apple logo lit up on its screen. Utilizing the click wheel, I happened upon a song, curated by a name unfamiliar to me at the time: Lecrae.
“Now all I see is money, cars, jewels, stars / Womanizers, tough guys, guns, knives, and scars / Drug pushers, thugs, strippers, fast girls, fast life / Everything I wanted and everything I could ask life”
Click.
This was my first introduction to Christian hip-hop. Having just committed afresh to Christianity and looking for ways to express my humanity and honor God, I was all caught up in religion. Hearing all that language about sin? No way. I turned it off.
In time, I would return. There was something about the music’s content, its realness, that attracted me — and it would come to spare me my sanity as I grappled between my Blackness and my seemingly counterfeit faith. It is this tension between sacred and secular, between spirituality and culture, that made Christian hip-hop an incisive tool in retaining both my personhood and the purity of my faith.
***
Innovative enslavement disguises as fresh freedom.
As early as sixth grade, I felt the profound emptiness of living according to my own desires, so I chose to give up my life for Jesus. I felt I was spiritually transcending — at the cost of assimilation to white evangelical culture.
Growing up in Colorado Springs, Colo., also known as “a mecca for evangelical Christians,” my newfound Christianity absorbed surrounding evangelicalism. Instead of sermons centering the mistreatment of the oppressed, our politics centered issues of sanctity: opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage. The issues I heard about on the news at home misaligned with everyone’s concerns at church.
When I was left on the margins, an alien floating between non-believers and church folk, Christian hip-hop spoke to me:
“I really can’t tell if I’m overdressed or I’m underdressed / If I’m underpaid or just overstressed / If I’m cynical or just over this / Cause I’m tired of tryna get over there, man it’s over there / Party’s over”
***
I’ve been caught up in Christianized double-consciousness.
I’ve lived almost my entire life under the white normative gaze. I’ve had my share of weird experiences — hair petting, scary-calling, athlete-comparing — but tying them to racism? That seemed extreme.
During the summer of 2020’s racial awakening and the Covid-19 scare, I decided to work as a Christian camp counselor in Colorado’s beautiful mountains. I was one of two Black counselors. As we trained, I realized I felt estranged.
No internet service. What was going on with the Black Lives Matter protests downtown, around the United States? Hardly anyone that I was around was talking about race. While the others used their free time to have Bible study, play volleyball, or hang out, I went to the WiFi-equipped common area and looked up news articles and videos. I tried to read up on what was going on in the country. But it was never enough.
This camp, centered around helping children find purpose, find life, find God, seemed to take little concern for the summer’s racial awakening. Even in training, before the children arrived, our Christian practice was centered around character building.
When the news came that the kids would not come because of Covid-19 restrictions, so camp would be canceled, a part of me actually uttered a sigh of relief.
Once again an alien floating between non-believers and church folk, Lecrae’s music spoke to me:
“Aw man, now they actin’ like I’m suddenly political / Told me shut my mouth and get my checks from Evangelicals / Boy my momma raised me on Angela and Eldrigde / Chuck Berry made it, but the credit went to Elvis”
***
I am hesitant to categorize this music that resonates with me. It’s not a genre. Mainstream radio doesn’t play it, and neither does the church on Sunday morning. Christian hip-hop is more than just music; it is a movement. Much like the protests of two summers ago, which parts of the media tried to co-opt for their own political agendas, Christian hip-hop (a name often ascribed to the music, rather than professed by its curators) refuses to be named.
I believe the complexity of Christian hip-hop is a lot like mine at Harvard: learning to love myself, for myself, just as I am. Attempting to glorify the God who calls me son, all without giving up my personality, my unique identity, my cultural background. Christian hip-hop is a golden needle in a haystack, a jewel in a barren field, a forsaken treasure. It is a testament to the potential for a flourishing Black and Christian cultural identity.
When my Christianity — constantly threatened by cultural assimilation and the transgression of someone else’s social norms — is nearly lost, Christian hip-hop acts as a surgical knife, dividing between the beautiful and the ugly, putting me and my faith back together again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The trees are bare in Harvard Yard and the icy winter temperatures of Boston have finally set in, accompanied by yet another fixture of early-Spring semester Harvard: the reappearance of the Harvard Board of Overseers in the news as the body gears up for its elections in April.
The elections themselves seem straightforward. There are two ways alumni can appear on the ballot: They can be nominated by a Harvard Alumni Association committee or they can garner enough petition signatures to appear as outside candidates.
This year, the secretive group has come under fire from Harvard Law School alumn Harvey A. Silverglate ’67, who revealed he likely won’t meet the signature threshold to appear on the ballot for the board’s election — a threshold the body itself sets.
Silverglate’s criticism? In an effort to promote their own candidates, the Board of Overseers has made it more difficult for outsider candidates to see their names on the ballot.
But what makes this mysterious board — whose prior members include Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson ‘92 — so special? Why did former President Barack Obama, who would later hold the highest public office in the country, first seek election to this board? More fundamentally, what does the Board of Overseers — Harvard’s second-highest governing body — even do?
It may seem somewhat surprising that most Harvard students probably could not tell you who constitutes this ostensibly powerful group, or what business the Board of Overseers actually oversees. Harvard’s public enumeration of the board’s expectations is a sparse two pages bursting with vague duties such as “helping the president and other senior members of the University,” and “staying informed about Harvard.” At one of the nation’s premier research universities with a towering endowment worth billions, what purpose does the second-highest governing board serve?
Perhaps the obscurity surrounding the Board of Overseers’ operations can be attributed to the Harvard Corporation, the University’s considerably more powerful and only other governing board, which often overshadows its larger but lesser counterpart. Still, we don’t discount the significance of the work being done by the Overseers — and we feel the time is ripe for a conversation among students about what we would like to see from the University’s (second) most elite body.
For one, we desire greater transparency. The Board of Overseers should make itself more known within the Harvard community and transparent about its relationships with the Corporation. Members ought to be clearer about what issues and values they prioritize.
Take Harvard’s decision to divest from fossil fuels in 2021. The announcement came in the wake of sustained student activism, and also after three petition candidates backed by the pro-divestment alumni group Harvard Forward were elected to the Board of Overseers. As undergraduates, we only witnessed the work and impact of student divestment campaigns; the role of the Board of Overseers was less clear. Transparency about the board’s involvement in this cause would be helpful not just to understand the University’s inner workings, but also to allow for future collaboration between student leaders and board members on areas of mutual interest like fossil fuel divestment.
Second, we hope the Board of Overseers maintains its democratic practices in order to truly represent the interests of alumni. Silverglate was right to point out recent changes to the board’s rules that make it more difficult for petition candidates to be elected, such as raising the signature threshold to appear on the ballot and limiting the number of petition candidates who can serve at one time — the second change having been suspiciously (and unjustly, in our opinion) enacted in the wake of Harvard Forward’s successful alumni grassroots campaign to seat three petition candidates on the board in 2020.
We call on the Corporation and the Harvard administration to ensure that future changes to the board’s election practices protect, rather than erode, the ability for alumni to nominate and cast their votes in favor of the candidates they deem most suitable for positions on the Board of Overseers.
Regardless of your feelings about Silverglate’s candidacy — which focused on upholding free speech and downsizing the administration — or his likely failure to secure nomination this spring, his run catalyzes necessary conversations about the role of the Board of Overseers and its representation of alumni. What issues do we want board members to trumpet, and what credentials do we expect them to hold? These are the underlying questions we must consider when talking about the Board and how it runs.
Inevitably, many of us will one day become alumni ourselves, whose votes will elect future Board members. Prior to graduation, we should seek a better understanding of the Board of Overseers both to improve its current function and to protect our future voices and votes.

Welcome back dear reader
I’m about to spill some tea
And reveal a juicy secret
‘Bout that prized Harvard degree.
People tend to wonder
How to get into this school
But what you may not know
Is that it’s not an equal pool!
We students like to think that
We all got here based on merit,
But many have advantages
That they simply inherit.
So if you want to earn a spot
In next year’s Harvard class,
Read these simple steps
And you’ll be sure to get in fast.
Step one: be a legacy
That can help you win!
If mom and dad both went here,
You’re more likely to get in.
Meritocracy’s a myth and
Hard work doesn’t mean admission
But a relative or two
Can help you pass the competition.
How much does it help, you ask?
Well research makes it clear
You’re six times more likely to get in
Than non-legacy peers.
Of course that’s only “one of
>Many factors” in the call,
But I, dear reader, think it
Shouldn’t factor in at all.
Legacy admissions
Have been used by Harvard plenty
But the practice started long ago
Way back in 1920.
Back then, rich fancy colleges
Were wary of the news
That spots were being taken up
By Catholics and Jews
So wealthy Anglo-Protestants
Made the quick decision
To use a person’s lineage
To help promote division.
Since most of their alumni
Were still Protestant and white,
Preferencing their children
Kept all others out of sight.
So though it’s likely not a new
Or shocking revelation,
Legacy admission
Was meant for discrimination!
Even now, despite much time,
Recent data states,
White legacy applicants
Exist at higher rates!
One recent study found two-fifths
Of white kids at this school
Were sports recruits, legacies,
Or kids of staff. Not cool!
And, in that statistic, too,
There’s one more I forgot:
If your folks are donors, then
That really ups your shot.
“But wait,” you counter, “Surely now,
The process has improved.
Having Harvard parents
Doesn’t mean you’re just approved!”
While having family preference
Doesn’t mean you’re guaranteed,
It does give folks a boost
That many simply just don’t need.
Children of alumni
Tend to be a privileged crowd
Connections, schools, and money
Leave them rather well endowed.
Growing up with privilege
Means you’ve got a big leg up
‘Cause you can access knowledge
And alums who know what’s up.
So why give more advantage to
The kids who, from the start,
Have odds stacked in their favor?
That really isn’t smart.
Other elite schools have
Come to similar conclusions.
Johns Hopkins and Amherst
Did away with such exclusions!
Harvard needs to get on board
And quickly make a switch,
For legacy admissions
Mainly help the white and rich.
So what is holding Harvard back?
Why have they clung so long?
Dear reader, it was money
And donations all along.
Many schools have argued
That a slight legacy preference
Will increase gross donations.
But for this, I have no deference!
Research indicates that
Correlation here is low,
A strong legacy preference
Doesn’t always mean more dough.
Another common argument
That colleges will lend,
Is that legacy admits
Are more likely to attend.
This is known as “yield”
In the college industry.
It helps schools in their rankings
But that all seems moot to me.
Harvard’s clout is such that
Students will choose to attend
No matter who their parents are —
It’s not hard to comprehend.
Now, before I leave you,
It’s important to address
The SFFA lawsuit
Which has occupied the press.
Folks like Clarence Thomas
Have asserted the position
That strong legacy preference can
Pollute college admission.
But in these conversations
Thomas also tends to add
That race conscious admissions
Can be similarly bad.
Although these practices get grouped,
They’re not at all the same.
They both serve different purposes
That I’ll proceed to name.
Race conscious admissions
Aims to redress racial bias
That exists within a system
And is clearly far from pious.
Race conscious admissions
Make a college more diverse,
But legacy admissions tend
To do just the reverse.
One process helps remedy
A bias that persists.
The other one exacerbates
White privilege that exists.
So yeah, I hope by now I’ve
Been real clear ‘bout my position.
Harvard, it’s high time we ditched the
Legacy admission.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Undergraduate Association held the grand opening of the University’s first Crimson Career Closet Monday afternoon on the 10th floor of the Smith Campus Center in partnership with Common Spaces and the Office of Career Services.
HUA Co-President Travis Allen Johnson ’24 said he felt the opening of the clothing closet was a “huge success” and anticipates a “great reception from students” in its future iterations.
“I think it was really incredible seeing students come and really express that this is something that they really want,” Johnson said. “I know one student in particular came and was able to look through clothing and mentioned that this is a resource that not only will she benefit from, but she’ll also tell her roommates and her friends.”
The clothing closet will remain open to students Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 3:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. During its first day, visitors were only allowed to view the clothing collection, though beginning Friday, students can make an appointment on the HUA website to check out clothing from the closet.
Students can preview the HUA’s inventory on the website and filter clothing by size or color, and may arrive at their appointment with a specific item in mind or come to browse. Students may also donate items of clothing by bringing them to the HUA office or general meetings.
“It’s personally and professionally really exciting and rewarding to see this come to fruition,” Johnson said. “This is a program that LyLena and I have envisioned for almost a year now when we decided to run together.”
About 20 to 30 students visited the grand opening, Johnson said. Two Harvard staff members came to donate clothes. The HUA provided doughnuts and lemonade to students who attended.
Dawn Ling, an assistant director of administration at the Office of Undergraduate Education, came by the clothing closet on its opening day to donate items.
“If the students find it to be helpful, and they’re receptive to this, then I’m 100 percent in support. I think it’s a wonderful thing,” Ling said. “I know when I was a college student that lots of my classmates could have benefited from it.”
Ling said she heard from a colleague there was also a professional clothing initiative under the former student government structure, the Undergraduate Council, which subsidized professional clothing purchases for a select number of students. Upon reaching out to HUA co-president LyLena D. Estabine ’24, Ling learned about the clothing closet.
Estabine said the co-presidents were inspired by their work in the Undergraduate Council to create the clothing closet, building on the previous government’s initiative, which provided subsidies to some students to purchase professional clothing.
“There were always more students who needed the service than could be provided for,” Estabine said. “We wanted to create a system that was more sustainable, both environmentally as well as economically, and make student activity fee dollars work further and for longer.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Protesters interrupted the Cambridge City Council’s regular meeting at City Hall Monday evening to demand accountability for the Cambridge Police Department officers involved in the police killing of Sayed Faisal last month.
The demonstration lasted for approximately one hour in the Council chamber and subsequently in the hall outside the Council’s offices, while the Council itself met to discuss de-escalation, body cameras, and policing more broadly.
“Mayor Siddiqui, City Manager Huang, and City Council, it has been over a month since Sayed Faisal was murdered by the Cambridge Police Department, and we still don’t have any answers,” a protester shouted during the public comment portion of the meeting.
The demonstration comes two weeks after the protesters’ first display in City Hall. Since Faisal’s killing, demonstrators across Cambridge have repeatedly called on the city to release the involved officers’ names and the unredacted police report. Advocates have also demanded the termination and prosecution of the officers.
Before the protest began, MIT graduate student Hannah M. Flores devoted much of her public comment at the meeting to a moment of silence for “everybody that was killed by the police.”
“It’s a moment of silence because their blood is on your hands,” she said to the Council. “You guys are in actual positions to change something.”
When Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui attempted to stop Flores from continuing on the subject of Faisal’s killing, Flores responded that she was exercising her “right of freedom of speech.”
More than a dozen protesters filed into the chamber as Flores spoke. After a moment of silence, the protesters stood and began to chant “Release the names!” and “No justice, no peace!” from the rear of the chamber.
While the demonstrators shouted, the councilors immediately left the chamber to resume the Council meeting virtually.
The protesters remained for several minutes afterward, and several took turns speaking to an empty chamber at the public comment podium.
Over a Zoom meeting, the Council considered 13 policy orders, one of which would initiate the process of obtaining body-worn cameras for police. The Council voted to adopt this order, with all present members voting in favor except City Councilor Quinton Zondervan, who argued that the cameras are a counterproductive use of funds.
“They buy into the notion that the way we do a lot of policing in the United States, and at Cambridge, is basically okay,” he said in reference to the body cameras. “So what this ends up doing is adding to the police budget, giving them more tools to work with, but ultimately not really resolving the problem that is before us.”
“The problem is the guns, not the body cameras,” Zondervan added.
Other policy orders on the agenda included a request that the police commissioner explore “less-than-lethal” alternatives that the police department can deploy and that the city manager engage a third party to examine the CPD’s methods for de-escalation, as well as mental health response practices.
The demonstrators plan on continuing their protests at every future City Council meeting. Prominent protest figure Suhail P. Purkar said there would be “hundreds of protesters” at the next meeting.

Harvard non-tenure-track faculty members announced their plans to form a union, launching a public card campaign for official recognition Monday.
In a press release, Harvard Academic Workers-United Automobile Workers stated that it seeks to bargain a contract for the University’s non-tenure-track faculty, which includes lecturers, preceptors, postdoctoral fellows, instructors, researchers, teaching assistants, and adjunct faculty. Non-tenure-track faculty may only hold teaching appointments up to eight years.
“What I want to see is for me and the roughly 6,000 other non-tenure-track faculty — teachers and researchers across Harvard — for us to have a seat at the table and a voice in the decisions that get made that impact those working conditions,” said Thomas A. Dichter ’08, lecturer in History and Literature.
HAW-UAW is demanding a contract that improves job security, parental leave, and health insurance; addresses inequalities in child care support; increases protections for international workers; and strengthens measures against discrimination, harassment, and bullying.
“We are banding together because people are being taken advantage of, because one person’s voice cannot get very far with the Harvard Corporation,” said Mary J. Brown, adjunct assistant professor of Social and Behavioral Sciences. “Together we are stronger and hopefully we can make the situation better for all of us.”
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment.
Organizers said contracts for non-tenure-track faculty — called letters of appointment — do not adequately protect employees or provide them with job security.
“Harvard administrators can make changes to our appointments without having to explain themselves, without having to give us notice,” Social Studies lecturer Ana I. Keilson said.
Michaela J. Thompson, an instructor at the Harvard Extension School, said the contracts are “entirely Harvard-facing.”
“We have no voice in Harvard governance,” she added. “We’re not included on committees or in meetings in which our fate is decided.”
Last Thursday, The Crimson reported that Harvard Kennedy School Dean Doug W. Elemendorf is forcing out non-tenure-track faculty member Joan Donovan, according to three Kennedy School staff members. According to Kennedy School spokesperson James F. Smith, the school is winding down her project “because it does not have intellectual and academic leadership by a full HKS faculty member, as required of all long-term research and outreach projects at HKS.”
Organizers said compensation is among the most important issues for the new unionization campaign.
The average monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Cambridge is $2,700, according to Cambridge Open Data. HAW-UAW organizers said many non-tenure-track employees make as little as $50,000 per year.
“We live in one of the most expensive housing markets in the country, and we are not compensated in a way that is commensurate with how expensive it is to live here,” Dichter said.
“I have two kids in daycare, and their daycare bill every month is more than my entire paycheck for my half-time position teaching History and Literature,” he added.
HAW-UAW is affiliated with the long-standing UAW, which is also the parent union of Harvard’s graduate student union.
Organizers have been planning the unionization campaign since 2018, according to Keilson and Thompson. Many HAW-UAW organizers have previously been part of unionization efforts at other institutions.
“Look, higher unionization in higher education is increasingly the norm,” said Keilson, who was previously part of Columbia University’s graduate student union.
Though the campaign publicly launched Monday, organizers said they feel confident in its success because of the support the drive has already amassed.
“We currently have hundreds of supporters and organizers across the University in all schools and on all the campuses,” Keilson said. “We wouldn’t be going public if we didn’t feel confident that we had a majority of support moving forward into our card campaign.”
In the coming weeks, workers will sign authorization cards to prompt either voluntary recognition of the union by Harvard or a formal election overseen by the National Labor Relations Board, which requires a majority vote in favor of the union for certification.
Keilson said she does not expect Harvard to voluntarily recognize the union, citing previous pushback against Harvard’s graduate student union before the NLRB certified their election in 2018. Still, she said she’s “confident” that the University will eventually “come to the bargaining table.”
The campaign has support from several other faculty members and local advocates.
“There are lots of tenure-track and tenured faculty at this university who are strongly supportive of the push by non-tenure-track faculty to seek union recognition,” History professor Kirsten A. Weld said.
City Councilor Kenzie Bok ’11 offered her support in a tweet Monday.
“So proud to support @HAWorkers in their quest for a union!” she wrote. “I used to do this work and I know these academic NTT workers are being constantly squeezed even as they make up an increasing % of instructors at our universities.”
According to the American Association of University Professors, 73 percent of all faculty employed by higher education institutions are non-tenure-track.
Over the past few decades, Weld said, non-tenure-track faculty have been taking on a greater number of teaching hours all across the country.
“More and more of the labor hours performed by instructors in U.S. universities are performed by people who are in increasingly precarious employment conditions,” Weld said. “That has a corrosive effect on the kind of work that they’re able to do as educators. It means they don’t have access to academic freedom.”
The HAW-UAW’s first rally will take place on Feb. 14 at the University’s Cambridge and Longwood campuses.
“We’re ready,” Dichter said. “Yeah, it’s time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Psychology professor Katie A. McLaughlin was tapped last week to be the inaugural executive director of the Ballmer Institute for Children’s Behavioral Health at the University of Oregon.
Funded by a gift of over $425 million from Steve A. Ballmer ’77, the former CEO of Microsoft, the Ballmer Institute will train educators in adolescent mental health and provide the first undergraduate child behavioral health major in the nation.
McLaughlin, who currently serves as the director of the Harvard Stress and Development Laboratory, primarily studies how a child’s environment influences their brain and behavioral development. She holds a joint Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology and Chronic Disease Epidemiology from Yale University.
In taking the helm of the program — which will be based at the University of Oregon’s new Portland campus — McLaughlin said in an interview Monday that she hopes to deliver “system-wide change” that will shift childhood mental health care to a preventative model.
“Public health is really a model that focuses on this idea of prevention, early identification, and the delivery of interventions to prevent health problems from getting worse,” McLaughlin said. “And that hasn’t traditionally been the focus of psychology and psychiatry, social work, or really any of the mental health professions.”
“So tools to identify kids who are starting to struggle and delivering interventions that will prevent those problems from becoming worse over time — that’s really a completely novel approach to mental health services in the United States,” McLaughlin added.
McLaughlin said that the pandemic exacerbated the increasing rates of mental health issues among children and teenagers. She says that while some solutions emerged from the pandemic — such as increased access to telehealth services — there remains a shortage of childhood mental health professionals.
“The whole vision of the Ballmer Institute is based on an idea of training a workforce of mental health providers,” she said. “And this is one of the most promising solutions to the problem.”
To combat this shortage, the Ballmer Institute will provide an undergraduate program that allows graduates to enter directly into the workforce as child behavioral health specialists in Oregon. Currently, mental health professionals must undergo further training and education past an undergraduate degree in order to practice in the field.
“The idea here is that we’re creating a mental health profession that only requires a college degree to be ready to practice in the community,” McLaughlin said.
The program will serve as a model for other states to combat the current shortage of childhood mental health professionals, she said, with the training becoming “hopefully broadly available in the next five to 10 years.”
Despite her excitement to take up her new post in Oregon, McLaughlin expressed her gratitude for her colleagues and time in Cambridge.
“I’m incredibly excited about this opportunity because I see just enormous potential that it has to help so many children and families,” McLaughlin said.
“I’m also really sad to be leaving the amazing community here at Harvard, which has been remarkably nurturing and supportive of me and of my work,” she added.
McLaughlin will begin her new role in August.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology signed an agreement last month to return a house post to the Gitxaała Nation, a First Nations government located at Kitkatla, British Columbia, per a Jan. 25 press release from the tribal group.
The return of the house post is part of the Peabody Museum’s broader initiative to repatriate Indigenous objects of cultural and historical significance. Last month, the museum announced it transferred ownership of an ancestral Alutiiq kayak to the Alutiiq Museum, a repository of cultural artifacts.
The January agreement comes nearly two years after Harvard was accused of violating the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act.
The Peabody Museum first came into possession of the house post in 1917 after it was sold “under duress” from Christian missionaries to the Boston Fishing Company in 1897, according to an email from Gitxaała Nation Program Manager Dustin Johnson. Since it was acquired by the museum, the post was on display on the first floor until it was moved to storage in 2002, according to Peabody Director Jane Pickering.
The Gitxaała Nation has communicated with the Peabody Museum since spring 2021, and the house post repatriation request was formally submitted to the museum in fall 2022, Johnson wrote.
The house post is set to reach Prince Rupert — a cultural hub of various Indigenous populations — in March, where it will be temporarily held in the Museum of Northern British Columbia. As part of a string of events to commemorate the repatriation, the Gitxaała Nation intends to host a private viewing of the post shortly after its arrival before a public celebration of the occasion.
Celebrations will culminate in erecting the house post in adherence to Gitxaała traditional protocols within the Lax Klan Cultural Center following its construction — estimated to be completed in late 2024 or early 2025, according to Johnson.
The tribal group will also send a delegation to an event at the Peabody Museum later this spring.
The post stands at a height of 12 feet and features ornate grizzly bear carvings characteristic of the Gitnagun’aks house group of the Gisbutwada, otherwise known as Gitxaała’s Killerwhale Clan. The totem pole from which the house post originated was among many of the Gitxaała Nation’s cultural artifacts that were cut down and burned amid colonial imposition.
“This surviving portion of the totem pole was saved by Gitxaała ancestors and stored inside the longhouse of the Gitnagun’aks,” Johnson wrote. “This was during the period of the Potlatch Ban in Canada, when many aspects of First Nations’ culture and governance had been made illegal under colonial law and when First Nations people were struggling to survive amidst genocide.”
The Gitxaała Nation is actively working towards debuting a virtual museum through which visitors can access online exhibits to learn about the tribe’s cultural belongings, according to Johnson.
“The return of this house post is a symbolic act of reclamation and a testament to Gitxaała Nation’s resilience to survive colonialist genocide,” Johnson wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Assistant Attorney General Jonathan S. Kanter spoke about his work to modernize antitrust law at a Harvard Law School event on Monday.
The discussion, titled “Changing Antitrust Strategy,” was hosted by the HLS Antitrust Association and moderated by HLS professor Einer R. Elhauge ’83. During the conversation, Kanter discussed his work at the Department of Justice to change the way antitrust law is enforced, citing a system that was “out of touch” with current markets.
Kanter, who was confirmed to the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division in 2021 after previously working at the Federal Trade Commission and in the private sector, said the current metrics used to determine antitrust violations are “incompatible with market values.”
“What I discovered was that, in an antitrust court or agency, you are aligned with a lot of assumptions about how markets function, about how consumers react, how competitors reposition, and there was this sort of ingrained thinking and dependence on economic models,” he said. “And what I saw in business was facts that are different.”
According to Kanter, antitrust courts often emphasize the importance of profitability to corporations and overlook the link between share price and the wealth of corporate executives.
“In fact, there are companies that lose money, but because of their long-term durability or other factors, their share price goes up and so the executives will make money,” Kanter said.
On Jan. 23, Kanter was involved in a Justice Department Antitrust Division complaint which alleges that Google maintains a digital advertising monopoly. During the talk, Kanter explained a decision by the body to make the Google complaint’s text more readable to the general public.
“The antitrust laws were not written for an insular community and experts. They’re written for us, the people’s law,” he said. “It’s become, in my view, too insular and too technocratic.”
Kanter also addressed increased data collection by corporations, saying data is “growing more and more important by the day.”
“The risk of markets tipping, for example, is much greater today than it ever has been because we have multi-sided markets where people who are consuming the product are really the product, not the customer,” he said.
Kanter spoke about the lack of a “real, comprehensive privacy law at the federal level” and the solutions to risks that come with large-scale information gathering.
“We hired our first ever chief technologist, we hired data scientists, not just to help us understand data as we see it, but to help teach us how these markets function so that we can investigate with better visibility into where the issues might arise,” Kanter said.
“This is a problem that’s gonna get worse — not better,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard faculty and Cambridge Rindge and Latin School affiliates condemned a ban of the College Board’s Advanced Placement course “African American Studies” in Florida by the state’s Governor Ron DeSantis, who alleges the course puts “indoctrination” over education.
The course — which was developed by a committee that included Harvard professors Henry Louis “Skip” Gates Jr. and Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham — launched as a pilot program in 60 high schools for the 2022-2023 academic year. This fall, more than 500 high schools will join the program before it is widely offered in fall 2024.
DeSantis, who graduated from Harvard Law School in 2005, announced a statewide ban on the AP course last month due to what he described as a misalignment with Florida’s “Stop WOKE Act,” which prohibits schools from teaching critical race theory — the cross-disciplinary study of institutional racism.
The College Board published post-pilot changes to the course on Feb. 1, which include a move away from critical race theory. Still, an internal document circulated to teachers by the College Board denies that the course was altered “to appease” conservatives or the state of Florida, instead describing that changes incorporated recommendations from hundreds of professors.
Harvard Kennedy School professor Khalil Gibran Muhammad called DeSantis’ rejection of the course a “frontal assault on the independence of educators.”
“When there is an explicit or implicit challenge to an AP course that will more or less shape the curriculum of all students taking the class in all classrooms around the nation — and every college and university that will receive an appeal for credit from students who pass the exam associated with it — that’s a national issue,” Muhammad said. “People need to see that for what it is.”
Muhammad is one of 200 African American Studies faculty in higher education from across the U.S. who penned an open letter on Jan. 31 to condemn DeSantis’ ban. The letter had more than 700 signatures as of Monday evening.
“The contention that an AP curriculum in African American studies ‘lacks educational value’ is a proposition supported by white supremacist ideology, because it fundamentally demeans the history, culture, and contributions of Black people,” the letter reads.
Harvard Graduate School of Education professor Meira L. Levinson, who spoke against DeSantis’ block, said it is “important to explore lots of different dimensions of African American culture and life and history.”
“It’s important to recognize that this is an African American Studies course that’s being proposed, and not just an African American history class that’s being proposed,” Levinson said.
Levinson also cited research that shows the positive benefits of taking ethnic studies courses for some students.
“There’s a growing body of research that is pretty clear that these courses can have really important effects — positive effects — on kids’ learning, kids’ attendance, kids’ graduation rates, kids’ sense of self-confidence, self-efficacy,” Levinson said.
One of the 60 high schools that participated in the pilot program this year is Cambridge Rindge and Latin, a public school in Cambridge.
CRLS history teacher Rachel Williams-Giordano said she was “jumping at the opportunity” to teach AP African American Studies after first hearing about the course.
“My hope is that I will see the same amount of kids and enthusiasm that enroll into my APUSH and AP Government and Politics class in my AP African American Studies class,” Williams-Giordano said.
Williams-Giordano said she made an effort to prioritize a diversity of perspectives — including “conservative ideology” — in her version of the pilot course.
“Some of the more well-known Black conservatives, I use their frame of argument — like Candace Owens was frequently used in the class,” Williams-Giordano said. “Despite what Governor DeSantis is saying, I do — and other AP African American Studies teachers — we try to bring in alternative perspectives.”
CRLS’ iteration of the course included debates on topics including reparations, the teaching of critical race theory, and rapper Kanye West, according to Williams-Giordano and her students.
“We had a whole unit and we had a debate every day of the week. And she assigned our groups; we had to argue for whatever side we were assigned on whether we personally agreed with that or not,” said Ruth Andre, a member of Williams-Giordano’s AP African American Studies class.
Helen Hailemariam, a senior at CRLS, said taking Williams-Giordano’s class last fall felt like being in a “family.”
“I didn’t feel like I had to be the model minority,” CRLS senior Halima Osman said. “I could come into the room being loud and I wasn’t the loud Black woman in the room.”
Still, Hailemariam — an incoming freshman at Harvard — said the opportunity to take AP African American Studies should not be “a privilege.”
“I should be able to learn about a history that’s in relation to my identity, and I should be able to feel affirmed, my classroom experience should be supportive, it should be collaborative, and I shouldn’t feel like I have to sacrifice parts of my identity or ways of being to fit in,” Hailemariam said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fans at the historic Matthews Arena witnessed an instant classic the last time the Harvard women's ice hockey team (7-14-3, 6-10-3 ECAC) squared off against Boston College (16-12-1, 14-10-0 HEA) in the Beanpot. A game-winner by Becca Gilmore ’22 in the waning minutes of the third period secured a 5-4 victory over the Eagles in the championship game. The Beanpot title was the 15th in program history and the first for the Crimson since 2015.
One year later, Harvard hopes to recapture the magic as it faces Boston College in the first round of the 2023 Beanpot.
However, Beanpot history suggests otherwise for the Crimson. In 2015, Harvard captured the title by beating the undefeated, No. 1 team in the nation — Boston College. Subsequently, the 2016 Beanpot opened up with a rematch between the two schools, and the Eagles came away with the win following an 8-0 drubbing of the Crimson.
Additionally, Boston College's home, Conte Forum, will play host to the Beanpot's 44th iteration. Tournament hosts have historically been successful in the opening round with a win rate of 70%.
As Harvard seeks to become the first back-to-back winner since Boston College rattled off three in a row from 2016-18, it will have to defend its title with a vastly different squad from the 2021-22 team. All in all, the Crimson will be without the services of 10 players who suited up last year, including Gilmore, who tallied five points en route to winning the Beanpot MVP, and Becky Dutton ’22, who saved 47 shots during the tournament.
The early season matchup between both squads in Chestnut Hill that resulted in a 5-1 win by the Eagles will no doubt serve as the blueprint for each team's game plan. Harvard's chief concern in the rematch will be to shore up its defense. Boston College fired nearly 50 shots toward the net in the first match. The Crimson will seek to clog the shooting lanes so that another 43-save performance from sophomore goalie Alex Pellicci is not needed.
One factor that will help the defense is the insertion of senior defender and captain Kyra Willoughby, who missed the earlier contest. In addition to the defense, Harvard will try to kick its offense into gear. Senior forward and captain Anne Bloomer, who also missed the first matchup, should provide more firepower to the lineup.
For the Eagles, winning at the faceoff dot will be a point of emphasis. This will be easier said than done, as senior forward and captain Kristin Della Rovere is currently the NCAA leader in faceoff wins with 405. Boston College will also seek to correct its power play and stay disciplined. In the last meeting with the Crimson, the Eagles went 0-2 on the power play and committed six minor penalties.
Last year, Harvard entered the Beanpot as one of the hottest teams in the country. It was on a six-game winning streak and ranked within the top 10. The Crimson dominated its opponents during the six-game streak, outscoring them 26-6. This year Harvard enters as the underdog. Currently, it sits at eighth place in the ECAC and is riding a two-game losing streak.
Compared to preseason expectations, the Crimson's season has been underwhelming. After starting the season ranked No. 11 in the USCHO poll, Harvard has failed to find any sustained success. The Crimson has not yet been able to muster up back-to-back wins. However, Harvard has shown flashes of its potential throughout the season. It fully displayed its offensive and defensive prowess in its season sweep of No. 13/12 Cornell (12-11-2, 9-8-1 ECAC). In the first matchup, the Crimson shut out the Big Red behind 30 saves from Pellicci, while five different Harvard skaters scored in the second game of the series, including a hat trick from Bloomer.
Similarly, Boston College's season has been full of ups and downs. In November and January, the Eagles fought through four-game losing streaks. On the other hand, Boston College went on a seven-game winning streak earlier in the season and enters the Beanpot on the heels of a win over No. 12/11 Providence (18-9-4, 13-7-4 HEA).
Although the odds are stacked against the Crimson, the storied Beanpot is a different beast. If there's any place where underdog stories are standard — it's the Beanpot.

In a season with championship aspirations, the No. 10 Harvard men’s ice hockey team has leaned heavily on its top-six forwards and a series of late game comebacks to jump into the top 10 of the national rankings. However, in the semifinal of the Beanpot Tournament on Monday night against the Boston College Eagles, the script flipped completely.
In an instant classic edition of storied tournament, the Crimson jumped out to a 3-1 lead before surrendering two goals in the final five minutes of the third period to limp into overtime. However, first-year forward Marek Hejduk, taking advantage of more ice time after a slew of Harvard injuries, scored the game-winner with 1.5 seconds to play in overtime, sending the Crimson to the Beanpot championship game for the first time since 2017.
“In order to win, we've seen it not only in regular season games, but even in the Beanpot, guys that step up, whether it's a first year or somebody that maybe everybody wasn't talking about coming in,” head coach Ted Donato said.
Already playing down a top forward after sophomore forward Zakary Karpa missed the game with an upper-body injury, Harvard’s depth was tested further after senior defenseman and captain Henry Thrun departed the contest with an injury of his own. With the Crimson’s bottom two lines not contributing much on the season, as no bottom-six player had more than seven points coming into the contest, Harvard’s depth was tested in one of its most important games of the season, and Hejduk answered the call with the first and last goals of the game. Senior goaltender Mitchell Gibson also turned in one of his finest performances of the season, stopping 45 of 48 shots.
“I thought Marek was excellent all game and I think he and his linemates… I thought they did a nice job for us. In order to win, a lot of times the top players can cancel themselves out. So those guys who are a little bit lower down the lineup can really determine whether you have victory or defeat,” Donato said.
HARVARD 4, BOSTON COLLEGE 3 (OT)
After raucous player introductions, it appeared that the Crimson had broken the ice within the first minute of action after sophomore Jack Bar finished off a great give-and-go with senior forward and captain John Farinacci. However, Eagles head coach Greg Brown successfully challenged the play, arguing that Harvard had too many men on the ice, and the game remained scoreless.
However, the Crimson did not let the challenge deter their offensive push, as it controlled play on offense throughout the period. First-year forward Joe Miller had a great opportunity off a 2-on-1 rush with sophomore forward Matthew Coronato, but BC goaltender Mitch Benson slid across in time to make the save. Junior forward Alex Laferriere soon had a partial breakaway of his own, and sophomore forward Alex Gaffney made a great interception at the offensive blue line to generate a scoring chance, but Benson denied both chances.
“You get that shot of adrenaline when you score the goal, especially when a defenseman, Jack Bar, scores it,” Donato said. “We kind of prepared that [Bar’s goal] was going to go against us and so I thought the guys came right back and I thought they carried play right after that.”
However, midway through the period, Harvard’s offensive pressure paid off in the opening strike. After sophomore defenseman Ian Moore made a great stretch pass to first-year forward Casey Severo, Hejduk and Severo broke into the offensive zone on the rush. Severo fed a great pass to Hejduk as he was cutting down the middle, and Hejduk made a great backhand-forehand move to finish the play off, giving the Crimson a 1-0 lead. Harvard continued to maintain the edge in play after the goal, but the Eagles responded with a strong final shift to generate some momentum heading into the second period down by a goal.
BC’s momentum continued on their first shift of the second period, as Eagles captain Marshall Warren made a great move through the middle of the ice to create open space, but Gibson made the save and Thrun cleared the rebound. Only a minute later, the Crimson snuffed out any BC momentum when it capitalized on a penalty drawn by Farinacci. Junior forward Sean Farrell fired a perfect cross-ice pass to Coronato, who was stationed at the left faceoff circle, and he extended the Harvard advantage to 2-0 with his 15th goal of the season off a one-timer.
“Playing together now for four years, we've developed some chemistry together,” said Farrell of his dynamic with Coronato. “He's a really big goal scorer and I try to find him in any spots where he's ready to shoot. So, I think, a couple really good plays by [Laferriere] and Farinnaci on the power play and I just found [Coronato] in his one-timer spot.”
The Eagles began to push back immediately in an attempt to cut into the deficit, but neither forward Cutter Gauthier or defenseman Eamon Powell were able to beat Gibson, despite some quality chances. However, BC cut the deficit to 2-1 with a power play goal eight minutes into the period. With first-year defenseman Mason Langenbrunner in the box for goaltender interference, forward Mike Posma tipped a cross-ice pass from defenseman Lukas Gustafsson past Gibson to put BC on the board. Despite the Eagles breathing down its neck, Harvard responded with its second power play goal of the period five minutes later, as Farrell again found Coronato with a cross-ice pass for the sophomore’s second goal of the night. The teams traded chances in the final seven minutes of action, including a dangerous offensive sequence for BC in the waning seconds, but the Crimson held on and maintained a 3-1 cushion heading to the final 20 minutes.
“He's obviously one of the top playmakers and top players in the country. It's a pleasure for me to get to play with him,” added Coronato regarding his rapport with Farrell. “You definitely got to see the abilities he has tonight– it's always fun to play with this guy.”
Despite successfully defending a two-goal lead against Cornell just over a week ago, Harvard’s defense crumbled in the third period against the incredibly determined Eagles, with BC outshooting the Crimson 22-2 in the final frame. BC got to work in the offensive zone just under a minute into the period, with a strong period of puck possession and passing truncated by dangerous chances for forwards Nikita Nesterenko and Trevor Kuntar. After a Crimson scoring chance for Gaffney, the Eagles went to work again with a 3-on-2 rush that set up another period of sustained pressure. BC generated a flurry of dangerous chances, including a cross-ice pass that just missed forward Colby Ambrosio and a series of opportunities set up by Powell, but Gibson stopped them all before covering a wrap-around to stop play.
Despite holding back the relentless Eagles attack in the first 15 minutes of the third period, BC finally broke through with just under five minutes to play. After weaving through the offensive zone and past senior defenseman Ryan Siedem, Nesterenko finished off an impressive individual effort with a forehand lifted over Gibson’s right shoulder, cutting the Eagles deficit to 3-2. The overwhelmingly pro-BC crowd, silenced until the final minutes, came to life immediately to aid in the Eagles’ final push to tie the game.
Trailing by one, BC kept its foot on the gas. Only seconds after Nesterenko’s tally, Gibson made a point blank save on forward Cam Burke’s one timer, before a chaotic scramble in the crease forced Harvard to ice the puck. With tired players stuck on the ice and the team’s defense struggling to keep up with the Eagles, Donato used his timeout with just under two minutes to play. However, the move proved to be fruitless, as Gauthier’s perfectly placed wrist shot just after the ensuing faceoff tied the game at 3-3, sending the BC fans in attendance into a frenzy. The Crimson had one final chance to win the game in regulation when Coronato and Farrell created a 2-on-1 rush in the dying seconds, but Farrell’s one-timer sailed high, and the two teams headed to a five-minute, 3-on-3 overtime deadlocked at 3-3.
“I give Boston College a lot of credit. They put us under a lot of pressure. Certainly in the third period, they kept coming,” Donato said. “They're very well coached. They have some high end players…I think they had momentum on their side.”
In a chaotic extra session, both teams had golden opportunities to secure a berth in the championship game. Only seconds in, Laferriere was left all one in the slot, but his wrister was gobbled up by Benson. Gauthier fired a hard rising shot that sailed over Gibson’s head, while Gustafsson had his own chance off the rush, but he failed to finish it off. With time ticking under 10 seconds and Moore stuck behind the Harvard goal line, it appeared that the game was heading to a shootout to decide the result. However, after a perfect outlet pass from Moore, Laferriere found Hejduk flying down the left wing, and the Parker, Colo. native hammered a one-timer past Benson with under two seconds to play, sending the Crimson to its first championship game since 2017 and sending the team pouring off the bench to celebrate.
“With these two rushes I had tonight, I got the puck on my stick and just felt automatic from there,” said Hejduk, who saw his first overtime action of the season in the decisive seconds of the extra session.
“I'd have to check but I do think that was the first shift that Marek spent all year in overtime,” Donato said. “We had some guys tired, some guys banged up. I thought he was going and deserved the opportunity and, you know, good for him. He made a tremendous shot there.”
The Crimson will return to T.D. Garden next Monday to take on either the Boston University Terriers or the Northeastern University Huskies at 7:30 pm in the Beanpot Championship.

You promised yourself you would save money this semester. But the constant self affirmations of “I am an academic weapon” and “they’re just busy, they’ll text me back later” weren’t enough.
