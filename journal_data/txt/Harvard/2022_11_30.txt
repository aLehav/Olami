After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard suffers from an ideological diversity problem — it’s a point I’ve made again and again in this column by looking at the student population, the faculty makeup, and the campus culture, all of which are overwhelmingly liberal. Yet the discourse on Harvard’s campus is no different from the many echo chambers that exist across the country, in which individuals hear their own beliefs repeated to them more frequently than they encounter new perspectives.
While people in general should make an effort to break out of their echo chambers in the hopes of developing their own beliefs while understanding those of others better, we Harvard students have a special obligation to escape our echo chambers and broaden the horizons of our discourse.
For starters, we’re students, and it is our job to learn. We came to college to immerse ourselves in a variety of subjects, and we chose Harvard because we sought a liberal arts education that would push us to study new ideas. If we are ever to gain an understanding of different ideologies, now is the time.
Secondly, we aspire to be the citizen-leaders of tomorrow. How are we to be leaders in American society when we don’t understand the feelings of conservative individuals — who constitute over one-third of American citizens? How are we to be innovators in the world when the only flavor of politics we understand is decidedly Western and decidedly liberal? Making the world a better place requires understanding our society, and that means seriously grappling with different ideologies.
Harvard’s mission to inspire citizen-leaders is not merely aspirational — it is also reality. President Joe Biden’s cabinet is stacked with Harvard alumni, and the Harvard pedigree is not limited to one side of the aisle. Members of Congress from both parties (although primarily Democrats) disproportionately tout Harvard degrees and attending an elite law school like Harvard or Yale has become almost a rite of passage for Supreme Court justices, both liberal and conservative.
Do we really want our future Democratic congressmen to have never befriended a Republican or truly considered conservative arguments? And do we want future Republican presidents to have been too intimidated in college to discuss their political beliefs with their liberal peers? The current atmosphere at Harvard — where liberal ideas dominate campus discourse and conservative voices are uncommon — could turn this hypothetical into a reality. Our nations’ political institutions are strongest when the politicians who fill them understand the perspectives of those with whom they disagree; Harvard can improve America’s democratic durability twenty years down the line by making improvements to our campus culture today.
The case for a more ideologically-representative discourse at Harvard is not only encouraged by our mission statement; it also is implied in our motto. Veritas requires looking at multiple beliefs before deciding on what you believe is the truth. It means being open to the possibility that reality is more nuanced than we thought. It requires frequent debate, considerable research, and perpetual contemplation. Are we really being intellectually honest if the only professors whose classes we have taken are liberal? Are we being true to ourselves if we haven’t seriously reconsidered any of our beliefs in recent years?
Improving discourse at Harvard is necessary both for our own intellectual growth and for our contribution to society. It is a cause that we should pursue not only in our own self-interest, but also for the sake of others. If we succeed in increasing Harvard’s intellectual diversity among its students and faculty, if we break our echo chamber to ensure that differing viewpoints are represented more evenly, then we can accomplish the dictum engraved on Dexter Gate: “Depart to serve better thy country and thy kind.”

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences set a timeline for the school’s full transition to previous-term course registration for the spring 2024 semester, FAS Registrar Erika McDonald announced in a Tuesday email to students.
Students will register for spring 2024 courses from Nov. 1 to 15, 2023, and all returning students will register for fall 2024 courses from April 3 to 17, 2024, according to McDonald's email. Incoming students will register for fall 2024 courses from Aug. 26 to 28, 2024.
McDonald’s announcement marks the next step in the FAS’s implementation of previous-term registration. The school announced it would implement previous-term registration after more than 60 percent of faculty voted in May 2022 to pass a proposal ending shopping week, a decades-old scheduling quirk that allowed students to sample classes for one week prior to enrollment.
A FAS committee on course registration, formed in 2019, recommended the previous-term registration system in December 2021, a move which garnered backlash from some students, faculty, and alumni.
“Prior term registration will provide Harvard College and GSAS students with an earlier period to register for courses, more flexibility to adjust class schedules, and the ability to set their class schedules ahead of time and therefore be more thoughtful in their planning,” McDonald wrote in Tuesday’s email announcement.
The new timeline will not affect spring 2023 or fall 2023 course registration, which will run from Jan. 11 to 19, 2023 and Aug. 21 to 31, 2023, respectively.
Under previous-term course registration, class meeting times, course descriptions, and any class notes must be finalized two weeks prior to registration period. Course syllabi and Canvas sites must be available to students on the first day of course registration.
Following the May faculty vote, the FAS formed a committee of faculty, students, and administrators in charge of implementing the new system.
Associate Dean of Undergraduate Education, Academic Programs, and Policy Gillian B. Pierce ’88, one of the co-chairs of the committee, wrote in an email that the implementation body will now hone tools related to course registration.
“The next step for the committee will be to focus on developing course discovery tools for students, such as the common course template mentioned in the report of the course registration committee and the legislation,” she wrote. “We also continue to work on the necessary technology upgrades to support previous term registration.”

Chanting “Free China” and “No more lockdowns,” more than a hundred people rallied in Harvard Yard on Tuesday afternoon in solidarity with demonstrators in China protesting the country’s strict Covid-19 restrictions.
Protests erupted across China against the country’s “zero-Covid” policy over the weekend after a deadly fire in an apartment building killed 10 people on Thursday. The blaze occurred in Urumqi, the capital of China’s Xinjiang region, where stringent lockdowns have kept many residents confined to their homes for several months. Many who took to the streets in China suspected the lockdown rules may have contributed to the deaths in the fire.
Protestors gathered in front of the John Harvard statue holding blank white sheets of paper — a symbol of defiance against the government’s crackdown on free speech — over their faces. Others laid flowers at the foot of the John Harvard statue in honor of the Urumqi fire victims.
Attendees sang “Do You Hear the People Sing?” from the musical “Les Misérables” and the Chinese national anthem in between chants of “We don’t want dictatorship, but elections” and “Hey hey, ho ho! ‘Zero Covid’ must go.”
George Yean, a Harvard graduate student studying government, said he attended the rally to support those protesting back home, saying “this is probably the only thing we can do” as students living outside of China.
“My basic reason is to show my solidarity with China’s freedom-seekers even though they probably don’t represent the majority of Chinese people,” Yean said. “But everything is starting from a tiny portion of the population, so that’s why I feel I am morally obligated to join them even though I’m staying overseas right now.”
China’s strict approach for containing Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic has kept the death rate in China relatively low. Over 30,000 people have died of Covid-19 in China since the start of the pandemic, according to data from the World Health Organization. By contrast, the United States’ Covid-19 death toll surpassed one million earlier this year.
But some protesters cast doubt on China’s reported Covid-19 death toll.
Tammy C.-T. Lan, a graduate student from Taiwan, said she attended the protest to support the relaxation of Covid-19 restrictions and to “stop the censorship of how many people are actually dying.”
“They won’t tell us what they’re actually doing,” Lan said. “They won’t tell us what the actual conditions are within the country.”
Cosette T.-H. Wu ’25 said she attended the protest to support Chinese citizens in their quest for freedom.
“I think it’s less like I have specific demands about the situation in China and more that I think that the Chinese people should be able to make the demands that they want and see the change that they want to see,” Wu said.
Western coverage of the unrest in China demonstrates the significance of the ongoing protests because “usually censorship is swift and censorship is ubiquitous” in China, according to Lan.
“The fact that the people are really risking their lives to express their dissent within a totalitarian regime suggests how dire the circumstances there must be,” Lan said. “For us to be out here — it’s anything we can do to really stand in solidarity.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge officials on Tuesday discussed the city’s efforts to address homelessness in Central Square, where overdoses and some types of crime have risen over the last four years.
Reports of overdoses, street robberies, and assaults in Central Square have all risen since 2018, according to a presentation given by city staff during a Tuesday afternoon meeting of the City Council’s Human Services and Veterans Committee.
During a public comment period in the meeting, some Central Square residents said they feared leaving their homes and described having to dispose of used needles and human waste left on their property.
Cambridge City Manager Yi-An Huang ’05 said “troubling activity” in Central Square has increased, though he said he personally feels safe in the area.
“We are seeing validation of some of what folks are feeling and expressing,” Huang said. “We know that this has been a challenge for many years, but that there is a sense in both the data and the emotion that we’re feeling that something is a little bit different.”
During the meeting, city leaders, including Police Commissioner Christine A. Elow, Assistant City Manager for Human Services Ellen M. Semonoff, and Chief Public Health Officer Derrick L. Neal, spoke about the city government’s efforts to provide services to unhoused people and curb unsafe behavior.
Elow, who took over as Cambridge Police Department chief in January, said the department has increased its presence by dispatching a “high-impact patrol” squad and a patrol car with flashing blue lights to provide “visibility to make people feel safe” and “identify quality-of-life issues” in the area.
Though the department also deploys undercover officers in Central Square, Elow said CPD’s first priority is to connect people to services, adding that arrests are one of its “last resorts.”
Neal described the Cambridge Public Health Department’s efforts to “intervene and prevent” fentanyl overdoses, which include overdose prevention training, distribution of fentanyl test strips and naloxone, and a pilot program with Harvard students to set up naloxone vending machines.
Semonoff said the city is working to expand housing and shelter opportunities for unhoused people, including funding housing navigation services at shelters and providing more affordable housing vouchers through the Cambridge Housing Authority. She highlighted the current renovation of an affordable housing development at 116 Norfolk St., which will add 25 single room occupancy units to the building for “existing residents and individuals transitioning out of homelessness,” according to the project’s website.
But this increase in housing may be offset by the upcoming closure of two Cambridge homeless shelters: the Salvation Army’s emergency shelter, which will close in the spring, and a shelter at the Spaulding Hospital, which will close at the end of 2023. With the closures, Cambridge’s total shelter capacity could drop from 323 beds to 230 beds by 2024.
City Councilor Dennis J. Carlone, who attended the meeting, said Cambridge should leverage its wealth to create affordable housing and human services centers of its own, rather than relying on third parties.
“We’re not looking at the real problems and realizing that we have to act,” Carlone said. “We have to buy facilities. We can’t rent facilities forever.”
In an interview, City Councilor Marc C. McGovern, who chairs the Human Services and Veterans Committee, said many who engage in unsafe or illegal behavior are not themselves unhoused, but rather “prey on the unhoused people” by selling drugs and stealing.
On Tuesday morning in City Hall, McGovern, a social worker, unveiled the Unhoused Neighbors Project, a series of posters highlighting the stories and lives of unhoused Cambridge residents.
“Because they fell into a situation, whether it was by choice or by circumstance, where they don’t have a roof over their head, doesn’t mean we should get to treat them like shit,” McGovern said. “Being homeless is not a crime.”

The Harvard Institute of Politics hosted a panel of political, business, and military experts on Tuesday to discuss the need for a new generation of young leaders in America.
Former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick ’78 moderated the panel, which featured Harvard Business School Senior Fellow William W. “Bill” George, Harvard Kennedy School professor of public service David R. Gergen, and U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Shoshana Chatfield.
During the event, George emphasized the importance of character in leadership.
“We need a real, authentic [leader] who lead with a moral compass,” George said.
“I can give you some examples of very, very wealthy, well-known business leaders right now who are leading without a moral compass and we see the harm they’re doing,” George said.
Gergen suggested current political leaders are falling short as well.
“Accountability means get beyond the empty promises and deliver,” he said. “We way overpromise, and now we’re under-delivering.”
The panelists recalled the country’s post-war generation of politicians as models of leadership by service, pointing to former U.S. Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, Class of 1904, and John F. Kennedy ’40 as examples.
Gergen added that current leaders — and recent presidents in particular — are simply too old.
“Both of them ought to step back,” Gergen said, referring to President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. “Coming into the White House at the age of 81 or 82 or 83 is just not good.”
“You have to be able to adapt, you have to be able to think clearly, and, by the way, you’re going to be the person with the finger on the button,” Gergen said.
George said it is time for the older generations to step aside and assume a mentorship role
“Our job is to mentor and teach and coach and encourage the next generations coming up,” he said.
Gergen added he hopes the next generation will "restore the idealism of the country," citing young leaders including climate activist Greta Thunberg, education activist Malala Yousafzai, and the March For Our Lives founders.
“To get a generation that’s demanding change is really helpful,” he said. “That goes back to the culture of creating the leader we deserve.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard scholars Catherine Dulac, Robert J. Sampson, and Arlene H. Sharpe ’75 will become University Professors, Harvard’s highest faculty distinction, next year.
Some of Harvard’s most prominent scholars serve as University Professors, a post that allows faculty members to pursue research and teach at any school across the University.
Dulac, Sampson, and Sharpe will join 22 other University Professors in the post, effective Jan. 1, 2023.
Sharpe, a Comparative Pathology professor and the chair of Harvard Medical School’s Immunology Department, will become the Kolokotrones University Professor, replacing medical anthropologist Paul Farmer, who died last spring. She studies T cells, a type of white blood cell that helps the body fight infection and may help defeat cancer. She is working to translate her research into new therapies for cancer and autoimmune diseases.
Sharpe is the co-leader of the Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness, which was established in March 2020 at Harvard Medical School to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic and prepare for emerging outbreaks.
“I’ve been at Harvard as an undergrad, M.D.-Ph.D. student, and my whole career — just the inspiration I got as an undergraduate as well as through my training and then my colleagues, are what have kept me here all of this time,” she said.
Sharpe said her new appointment is a recognition of her students and advisees, as well as her.
“I feel like I have two families. I have my personal family and my lab family,” she said. “For me, it’s all of their hard work and creativity that really I’ve benefited so much from.”
Sampson, a Social Sciences professor, studies crime, disorder, inequality, and urban areas. He is also an affiliated research professor at the American Bar Foundation and the founding director of the Boston Area Research Initiative, a cross-university center that uses data-driven research to advocate for social justice in Boston.
“I am extremely grateful to President Bacow for providing a unique opportunity to forge new ties with colleagues outside my normal orbit,” Sampson wrote in a statement. “That includes new possibilities for teaching in other units at Harvard and exposing my FAS students to intellectual opportunities beyond a standard disciplinary course.”
Dulac, a professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology, has been appointed the Samuel W. Morris University Professor, replacing economist Dale W. Jorgenson, who died this summer. She studies behavioral neuroscience, looking at mice to understand the molecular and neurological mechanisms behind innate social behaviors.
“Being a faculty member at Harvard has allowed me to follow my passion for scientific research and teaching in collaboration with many inspiring colleagues,” she said in a press release. “I am intrigued and excited to continue to build on my existing work and creating new collaborations across the various Schools here at Harvard, which this appointment will further help foster.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Nov. 26 matchup between Harvard (3-7-2, 2-4-2 ECAC) and the University of New Hampshire (5-13-0, 4-10-0 WHEA) at Bright-Landry Hockey Center featured two teams hoping to correct course after a subpar start to the season. Entering the game, both teams had lost their previous three contests — but it was the hosts who snapped their streak. A second-period short-handed goal was the difference as the Crimson scored a much-needed 1-0 win over the Wildcats.
"It was a gritty win," head coach Katey Stone said. "We needed to bounce back after a tough couple of games."
As teddy bears lined the stands for the second annual teddy bear toss, the play on the ice was anything but soft as both squads combined for five penalties in the first period. The first of these five came eight minutes into the game. Harvard went on the power play following a roughing call against UNH forward Shea Verrier. But despite generating some quality chances, the Crimson could not find an early score.
Two minutes later, Harvard got another chance to play with an advantage as Wildcats forward Gabby Jones was called for cross-checking following a hit on first-year forward Gwyn Lapp. Their defense again stood firm as goalie Nicky Harnett made several saves to keep the Crimson off the scoreboard. Seconds later, it was UNH's turn to go on the power play, as sophomore forward Paige Lester headed to the box for an interference penalty. The Wildcats could not find a goal either, though, as Harvard killed off the power play with a mixture of blocked shots and saves by sophomore goalie Alex Pellicci.
The Crimson went 0-3 on power plays in the first period after it was unable to convert on a UNH slashing penalty around the 17-minute mark. After being granted a power play following an elbowing call on junior forward Shannon Hollands, the Wildcats generated their best chance in the first frame. With 30 seconds left, forward Brianna Brooks slid a perfect pass across the goalie to the back post. Unfortunately for UNH, the puck was cleared before forward Emily Pinto could connect.
"We addressed that in the locker room," Stone said about Harvard’s penalties. "We have to continue to find that balance of playing hard-nosed hockey."
Repairing two holes in the Wildcats' net delayed the start of the second period. It only took 33 seconds for the strength of the net to be tested, as Lester scorched a shot past Harnett to give the Crimson a 1-0 lead. After receiving an outlet pass from sophomore defender Mia Biotti, Lester fired a shot from outside the right faceoff dot that slipped between the goalie's legs for the score. The goal matched her season total from last season and continued a stellar start to her sophomore season.
"She's a very talented player,” Stone said. “It is no surprise that she is getting better."
Following Lester’s goal, UNH began to dominate possession of the puck. The Wildcats' offense generated several quality chances, including one shot around the 10-minute mark that hit the pipe. Shortly after, the offense was given another boost, as Harvard first-year defender Kate Kasica was assessed a minor penalty for body checking. Despite only registering two shots in the second half of the period, the Crimson was mainly able to survive the offensive onslaught due to the stellar play of Pellicci. The sophomore kept the Wildcats scoreless by stopping 15 shots, including everything from shovel to slapshots.
Once again, Harvard was called for a penalty to end the period. Pellicci was given a minor for pushing UNH forward Nicole Kelly to the ice after she collided with Biotti on a breakaway. First-year forward Indi Wagner served the two-minute roughing penalty.
Missed opportunities characterized the Wildcats' comeback efforts in the third period. UNH defender Charli Kettyle could not capitalize on two quality chances at the 11-minute mark of the third. After picking up the puck in neutral ice, she took advantage of a late Crimson defensive rotation to send a backhand on goal. Following the initial Pellicci save, Kettyle skated the puck around the back of the net and sent another shot on goal.
Late in the third, the physical play of the first period returned. The sequence started with a shot on goal by Biotti. With Harnett unable to secure the puck, both teams piled onto the ice in front of the keeper until Harnett finally got her glove on the puck to make the save and stop play. After the whistle, Hollands shoved a Wildcats skater to the ice, and Kettyle responded by punching Hollands. The refs assessed Hollands a cross-checking penalty and Kettyle a roughing penalty. Again, UNH could not find an equalizer on the powerplay, as several offensive possessions were called back for offsides.
Continuing the trend of the first two periods, the Crimson gave the Wildcats a chance to tie up the game late in the third period as it was assessed yet another penalty, this time a slashing call against sophomore forward Gabi Davidson Adams. Despite pulling the goalie, UNH could not find a late score as Harvard's penalty kill went 6-6 on the night to seal the 1-0 victory.
The Crimson picked up its third win of the season with notable absences. Senior captains Anne Bloomer and Kyra Willougby were absent from the Saturday game. Their availability for Friday's game against ECAC foe Clarkson is still in the air.
"Hopefully, we'll get a couple of kids back in the lineup," Stone said. "Not sure about that yet."
Harvard will look to build upon the win as it travels to Potsdam, N.Y., on Dec. 2 for a matchup with Clarkson (14-5-1, 3-3-0 ECAC). The Crimson has not defeated the Golden Knights in Potsdam since 2013.

To be honest, this article has been a long time coming. It all started when my friend, an Architectural Digest subscribee and suburban mother-aspiree, sent me this article titled “The 17 Most Beautiful Brutalist Buildings in the World.” And truth is, to save you the trouble of looking, they’re all really ugly. Even the 17 most beautiful brutalist buildings in the entire world are butt-ugly.
Ever since I came to live in the concrete wonder of Mather House, I can’t help but wonder what happened in the ’70s to make people think that brutalist architecture was, in the words of Lady Gaga, “brilliant, incredible, amazing, show-stopping, spectacular, totally unique, completely not ever done before”? I mean, the last two are technically true, but clearly, there is a pretty good reason for that.
Before you call me a house traitor and hater, I LOVE MATHER HOUSE. I love my room in the tower, the beautiful view of the river, the big windows in the dining hall, the community 🥺— you get the idea. But if you ask me, I’ll agree that she’s pretty ugly from the outside. And Mather doesn’t appear in Harvard postcards, so clearly, Harvard agrees too. In fact, every time my parents visit and we walk by Dunster, they ask me, “So why couldn’t you live there?” And I have to explain that beauty is skin-deep and whatnot, and yes, the random housing lottery is actually random.
This is all a roundabout way of saying, Harvard is ~beautiful~, but it also has some ugly buildings. And that’s ok! These ugly buildings have character. They take the hate, shake it off, and still stand tall. They make the beautiful buildings look more beautiful (would Dunster really get so much love if Mather wasn’t always chilling beside it?). They’re a historical reminder of architectural mistakes choices that were made. So without further ado, here it is: Flyby’s round-up of the ugliest buildings on campus (in no particular order), and why we still love them:
Mather House: See above. Ugly building, really good house.
Lev Towers: For all the hate that Mather gets, the Lev towers are pretty ugly too. And what’s up with the weird triangles on top? Are they solar panels?? Alien communication device? Straight-up weird decor? But residents get the same perks as living in Mather — big rooms, good views, and (mostly) working elevators.
New Quincy: Same as the previous item. It’s practical, I get it. The duplexes are nice. The windows are big. But you have to agree — it’s not particularly nice to look at. At least it makes Stone Hall look prettier!
Currier House: Kinda square looking? Windows are pretty tiny. Dining hall food is >>> but seating area vibes give retirement home. Again, no Currier hate — after all, the house is named after some pretty badass women. But unfortunate they didn’t get a prettier building to be remembered by, no?
William James Hall: If you’re not a social science person, you’ve probably never had reason to set foot in this building. But you’ve definitely seen it because WJH sticks out from the Harvard skyline like a sore thumb. Granted, this is why there’s such a fabulous view of Cambridge from the 15th-floor deck, but the tradeoff is the ivory concrete tower you have to traverse to get up there.
The Carpenter Center: Is it insensitive to call (according to its website) “the only building in North America designed by Swiss-born architect Le Corbusier” ugly? Maybe* my taste isn’t refined enough to appreciate this building that is home to the AFVS department (because if the artists chose this building it has to be kind of pretty right? Or at least edgy in a cool way?). But having never been inside, I’ll say it: the Carpenter Center is pretty ugly.
Note from the editor: *Definitely 
Graduate School of Design: Like the Carpenter Center, since some of the best architects in the world study in this building, I’m sure there are many nuanced ways in which it is beautiful. But in the opinion of my ignorant self (also never having been inside), I just don’t see it.
QED. I have no more to say on this topic. Understanding and appreciating architecture is not my forte. But if someone can explain to me why any building on this list is somehow tastefully beautiful, I am very open to learning — @flybyblog’s dms are always open.

Founded in 1907, the Harvard Forest has served as a laboratory and classroom for the University for 115 years. The forest is 70 miles from Cambridge in Petersham, Massachusetts. Visitors enter the sprawling property via the Fisher Museum, a couple miles off Route 2. The museum is neighbored by houses for visitors and research facilities.
A handful of cows graze in a pasture at the entrance to the forest. One of them eagerly approached the fence as visitors walked by.
The forest is located on the land of the Nipmuc Nation. The University’s relationship with Indigenous people and its stewardship of the land was a focus of the October guided tour, which fell on Indigenous People’s Day. Above, the group sets out on a two-mile guided field walk.
The forest contains a vast diversity of trees. Regular measurements of them are taken in tree censuses spanning the scope of the forest to observe large scale changes.
There are currently dozens of ongoing research projects at the Harvard Forest. One of the longest running experiments on soil warming has been collecting data since 1991. The experiment offers a look at how global mean temperature increase due to climate change will affect forest ecosystems. Above is a plot for the soil warming experiment.
A small salamander crawls underneath a piece of bark and fallen leaves next to the research plots.
Harvard Forest maintains five research towers across the forest, two of which can be walked up. Above is the Hardwood Tower, which stands 92 feet high.
On top of the Hardwood Tower, visitors take in sights of the canopy below, balancing themselves as the platform sways lightly in the wind.
The research towers contain equipment to take a variety of measurements, from carbon dioxide and other atmospheric gas levels to solar radiation, temperature, humidity, and more. One of the devices interfaces with a NASA satellite, providing local data in conjunction with other research stations around the world.
The panoramic view from the top of the research tower puts the changing leaves on full display, and also allows viewers to see them up close. Below, oak leaves in the canopy slowly start to change color.
The Harvard Forest’s monthly tours pick back up in February.
