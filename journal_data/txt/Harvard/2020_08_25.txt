After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences has hired Sheree Ohen as its first Associate Dean of Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging, FAS Dean Claudine Gay announced Monday.
Ohen, who currently serves as Chief Officer of Diversity and Inclusion at Clark University in Worcester, Mass., will begin in her newly-created Harvard position Sept. 28.
“Declaring our values is an important step, but only through institutional action will we make progress in becoming the Harvard we aspire to be,” Gay wrote in an email to FAS affiliates. “I am eager for the benefit of Sheree’s leadership as we work at every level of the FAS to dismantle the cultural and structural barriers that have precluded that progress.”
Gay wrote that Ohen brings experience in breaking down such barriers from her role at Clark, where her work won the university the 2018 Higher Education Excellence in Diversity Award.
“A highly principled leader, Sheree is known for the trusted partnerships she builds with people across the university community,” Gay wrote. “Those strong relationships have been essential to her effectiveness in advancing institutional change.”
Ohen is a former criminal defense and civil rights attorney who has made diversity initiatives in higher education her “life’s work,” Gay wrote. She speaks to universities and companies across the country, advising their inclusion initiatives.
Ohen will report to directly to Gay and be the “lead FAS administrator responsible for conceiving, developing, and overseeing strategies to advance and support diversity, inclusion, and belonging for all constituencies in the FAS,” Gay wrote.
Gay announced the creation of Ohen’s new role in a message to FAS affiliates last week along with a number of other diversity and inclusion initiatives, such as resuming the FAS search for four faculty specializing in ethnic studies.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay placed Anthropology and African and African-American Studies professor John L. Comaroff on paid administrative leave Monday afternoon following allegations that he sexually harassed students and retaliated against those who spoke out against him.
The Crimson reported in May that at least three current female students were in contact with Harvard’s Title IX office regarding allegations against Comaroff and that the Anthropology department had asked him not to use his department office and teach a course in the spring.
Gay announced her decision to place Comaroff on leave in a Monday afternoon email to faculty and students in Anthropology and African and African-American Studies. She referred to the “public reports of allegations of sexual harassment and retaliation” against Comaroff, a world-renowned scholar of African civilizations.
“Due to the seriousness of these allegations, and in accordance with University and FAS policies, I write to announce that the FAS has placed Professor Comaroff on paid administrative leave, pending a full review of the facts and circumstances regarding the allegations that have been reported,” she wrote.
“I believe that sexual harassment constitutes a form of discrimination that is both personally damaging for those who experience it and is an assault on our faculty’s fundamental commitments to equity and academic excellence,” Gay added.
Comaroff wrote in an emailed statement that he "denies all allegations of sexual harassment and retaliation."
"Today's announcement is prejudicial to the fair determination of any claims against him, punitive without any factfinding, defamatory, and a violation of the Harvard University Sexual Harassment Policy and Proc[e]dure's confidentiality rules," he wrote.
Comaroff was scheduled to advise graduate students this fall and teach AFRAMER 209A: “Africa Rising? New African Economies/Cultures and Their Global Implications” with his wife Jean Comaroff, also a professor of Anthropology and African and African-American Studies. Jean Comaroff taught a course in the spring by herself after the Anthropology department asked her husband not to teach the course.
The Crimson’s investigation also revealed allegations of harassment against fellow Anthropology professors Theodore C. Bestor and Gary Urton. Gay placed Urton on leave five days after the story’s publication, and he announced his retirement in July, though an investigation is ongoing. The department also announced the establishment of a standing committee to address what it called “an environment in which abuses continue to manifest and go undetected.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Chasten Buttigieg, an author, BGLTQ advocate, and husband of former presidential candidate Pete P.M. Buttigieg ’04, will join the fall semester’s cohort of Institute of Politics fellows, along with five other public and political figures, the IOP announced Tuesday morning.
Civil rights activist and attorney Jorge L. Vazquez Jr. and New York Times foreign policy journalist Carol Giacomo will join the IOP alongside Buttigieg this fall. Rounding out the cohort are three fellows returning to the Institute’s program: former Philadelphia mayor Michael A. Nutter, activist and founder of Love & Power Works Brittany Packnett Cunningham, and CNN political commentator and Republican communications advisor Alice E. Stewart.
The COVID-19 outbreak led the IOP to transition many of its programs online — including this semester’s fellows program. The fellows will lead virtual study groups, mentor a group of undergraduate students, and hold office hours, according to a press release announcing the fellows.
Fellows are expected to address “pressing” topics like the “2020 election, the fight for social and racial justice, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,” per the release.
Buttigieg joins the IOP after his husband became the first openly gay person to run a high-profile campaign for president in 2019. After Pete Buttigieg’s campaign ended in March, Buttigieg, a former teacher, began promoting his memoir, “I Have Something To Tell You.”
Student co-chairs of the Fellows and Study Groups Program, Carine M. Hajjar ’21 and Eric K. Jjemba ’21, wrote in the release that the fellows will be a part of discussing this “critical moment” in the nation’s history.
“A global pandemic, economic uncertainty, and a racial injustice reckoning here in the U.S. have made 2020 nothing short of eventful,” they wrote. “This combination of new and familiar Fellows will be instrumental in inspiring students to involve themselves in politics and public service at this critical moment.”
IOP Director Mark D. Gearan ’78 also wrote that the IOP was “excited” for this cohort of fellows to join the program.
“They bring their accomplished life experiences in elected office, public service, activism, and journalism and we are grateful for their engagement,” Gearan wrote. “The Fellows Program is a pride point for the IOP and by sharing their perspectives with our students, they will inspire Harvard students to lead lives committed to public purpose.”
