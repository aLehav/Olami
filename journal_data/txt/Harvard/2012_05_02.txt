After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jon Huntsman Jr., the former Governor of Utah and presidential candidate for the Republican Party, recently visited campus to give a talk at the Harvard Kennedy School. Huntsman’s main message to his audience was that the political world suffers from a lack of genuine leadership, both at the party and the government level. Asserting that the Republican Party is “not in a good place right now,” Huntsman went on to lament that, “There is a leadership void in the world…and when you have a leadership void, mischief tends to play out in the void.”
While Huntsman’s words may seem wise at first, they disguise a genuine problem in the relationship between political leaders and Harvard. Whether by claiming that America’s political scene does not have adequate leaders, or by explicitly encouraging young people to enter politics, prominent political figures who visit Harvard far too often urge students to take up a career in this field. Rather than encouraging young minds to enter politics so as to fill some perceived “void,” Huntsman and others like him should address the fact that politics needs individuals who hold genuine convictions they wish to uphold. The main problem with our political system is the reason that people choose to enter it in the first place. We need leaders who passionately believe in their ideals, rather than individuals who are guided by the idea of leadership for its own sake.
The despondent tone of Huntsman’s talk belies the hope he claims to see in the future. By negatively contrasting the present generation of political leadership with future ones, the former governor merely finds an ingenious way to implicitly criticize his own peers on the current political spectrum. While he is correct to find fault with his peers and many of our current leaders, this smacks of resentment from someone who openly refers to himself as a “failed politician.” If he is really so jaded with the current political climate, why come to Harvard to convert the next generation of career politicians? Having recently served as ambassador to China, Huntsman more than many others should value experiences different from a retail political career.
Last Friday, appearing at an event on campus with former President Bill Clinton, Ambassador Gianna Angelopoulos of Greece asserted that, “we need to train and inspire emerging leaders.” Rather than having the leaders of tomorrow be trained or inspired by those of today, let them discover themselves. Why enter politics at age 21, with a lifetime of learning and discovery yet ahead? Running for office, or making a name for oneself in Washington should not exist as hermetically-sealed career paths. When our current crop of leaders encourage this, they run the danger only of perpetuating the  problematic paths to power that so many today have pursued.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
How many of the world’s languages can you name? No, seriously, try it out.  Take out a piece of paper and just write until your brain cannot produce another language. My guess is that you have about twenty or thirty languages, maximum, and most of those came from taking country names and adding the appropriate suffix. If you named thirty, then congratulations: That’s a staggering 0.4 percent of the world’s nearly 7,000 languages.
Human communication and language is a wondrous achievement. Unfortunately, many of these languages are dying out, due mainly to globalization and the worldwide reduction to fewer and fewer linguae francae. In fact, within a century, more than half of the world’s 7,000 languages are likely to be extinct, and once a language is gone, there is no way to bring it back completely. Language extinction poses a grave cultural threat to our species, and we should take far stronger stances and measures for ensuring their preservation.
Not many people may be aware of this, but there is a lot of scientific knowledge that is only available in certain languages. K. David Harrison, a professor of linguistics at Swarthmore College, summarizes the situation nicely: “80 percent of species have been undiscovered by science, but that doesn't mean they're unknown to humans, because the people who live in those ecosystems know the species intimately and they often have more sophisticated ways of classifying them than science does.” An ocean-fairing people, for instance, could possibly have encoded in their language very specific—and still unknown to science—knowledge that has allowed them to cross thousands of miles of ocean in ways we do not understand.
Or, on a more light-hearted note, consider Tshiluba, a language spoken in southeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Tshiluba speakers have a word some linguists have deemed most untranslatable: ilunga, meaning someone ready to forgive any transgression the first time, tolerate it the second, but neither forgive nor tolerate the third.
Language is also an intimate link to one’s culture, family, and religion. There is nothing quite like communicating in your native language, no matter how advanced you might be in two, four, or eight others. Imagine if, today, you suddenly had to switch to a new language for the rest of your life: How much would you miss out in terms of communicating and expression with your family? Or consider the religious ties language has. It is not uncommon for some Native American communities to use their ancestral tongues to pray and “speak” with their deceased family members. Once the language is gone, so, too, is their link to their ancestors.
The majority of the world’s languages are spoken by less than one thousand people now, and they are generally only the elderly members of their respective communities. The children, recognizing the usefulness of learning the dominant language of the greater community, feel no need to learn the language of their home, simultaneously alienating the older generation and helping one more language disappear. It is not the children’s fault—more often than not, societal pressures force young people to learn the more widely-spoken languages if they want a chance at success and wealth.
Scientifically, this is a lot of data to be lost for the linguistic community, as well because in general, the languages that are disappearing are precisely the languages that are also the most poorly documented. Every language contains a world of unique information and offers insight into the mechanisms that dictate language use and structure. And endangered languages are not only wildly different from more widely-spoken ones, but they also tend to be much more complex and are thus uniquely poised to provide valuable insights into human language and universal grammar. Perhaps the most direct link linguistics has to our culture is digital now—computational linguistics is a growing field (think Siri), and every language that is lost could potentially hold undiscovered keys to breakthroughs in improving technological language.
There is no reason that languages should die. There are almost seven billion people on earth, and every person has the capacity to learn any language. One method to save languages is to simply transport native speakers of an endangered language to a community with a lot of people. Teach children these languages (the younger, the better and, if possible, babies), and within a generation, the numbers will speak for themselves (pun intended). Linguists should be sent in large numbers to the communities where this is not an option so that they can write grammars and record the remaining speakers. Through this, at least, we will not lose everything.  Other research can wait until this task is achieved.
We have so much to gain by preserving the world’s linguistic diversity—and even more to lose with language extinction. Once a language no longer has native speakers, nuances in grammar, pronunciation, and semantics will disappear with no hope to recover them. The world must turn its attention to preserving such an essential aspect of humanity soon, or we will all lose something special.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I was elected to Phi Beta Kappa as a member of the “Junior 24.” Recently, The Crimson’s editorial “What does Junior 24 stand for?” and Mr. Mihir Chaudhary’s response commented on the selection process for Phi Beta Kappa in an uninformed way. Recognition of academic achievement, the process used to honor such achievement, and a fair understanding of the academically recognized themselves is crucial in the Harvard community, indeed in any university context.
Harvard students certainly do achieve outside of the classroom. However, the College has many honors for extracurricular achievement. We have Pforzheimer Fellowships for public service and Innovation Challenges with large cash prizes. Our Rhodes, Truman, Marshall, and Gates scholars are honored for their contributions inside as well as outside the classroom, particularly in the field of community and public service. Many of these scholars even receive personalized coverage in the Crimson and the Gazette. Harvard College dropouts like Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates have been invited back to the university and praised for their contributions to society.
But more importantly, Harvard is first and foremost an academic institution with a duty to honor academic achievement using standard metrics. If PBK students are more academically focused than other students, then so be it. This is an institution of higher learning. Were members of the community not immersed in academia, universities would cease to make research contributions that improve our world. Even though we are blessed with the opportunities to pursue extracurricular activities, probably more than other schools, we must realize that there are other forums to laud achievement in non-academic areas.
Lauding members of Phi Beta Kappa for displaying “academic passion” is not equivalent to “declar[ing] the PBK 24 as the most naturally intelligent,” as Chaudhary contends in his letter to the editor. To typecast the PBK 24 inductee as one consumed by academic self-interest defined by the attainment of high grades and nothing else is to confuse the award with the person receiving the award. Foundations for great scholarship are often laid in the classroom, and academic scholarship can often be good for the world as well. A great scientist who pours their efforts into science classes and finds a cure for a disease, at the neglect of attending protest marches and tutoring schoolkids from underprivileged neighborhoods, has still done good for the world.
Nonetheless, many of the PBK 24 inductees have made impressive contributions outside of the classroom. One Class of 2012 inductee spent his freshman summer working for the United Nations in Venezuela, his sophomore summer volunteering in an orphanage in Kenya, and his junior summer doing research on humanitarian crises, putting himself at great personal risk by traveling to the West Bank. Another student, also now a senior, rowed Crew for three years. He both worked on a farm in Europe and wrote a novel during his junior summer. Yet another spent his sophomore summer working to understand barriers to healthcare provision for the mentally ill in Bangladesh. The previous summer, he had interned at the Bear Necessities Pediatric Cancer Foundation. Among other PBK alumni, Henry Kissinger and Ben Bernanke’s election to Phi Beta Kappa and college activity did not preclude them from becoming distinguished public servants. Simply receiving an award determined largely by classroom performance does not imply that someone is a uni-dimensional automaton solely preoccupied with securing high marks. PBK only honors one component of the lives of these students.
Finally, some have accused PBK of rewarding students who have “gamed the system” by taking only easy classes. For the Junior 24 and the Senior 48 election processes, twice the numbers of students receive invitations to apply than are eventually inducted. So, it isn’t that just the top 24 Grade Point Averages across disciplines are given the award. Review of applicants is done by professor Logan S. McCarty '96 and students already in the society. The selectors make a point not to elect people whose transcripts do not show evidence of rigorous coursework. Indeed, this is why students in the committee weigh in with their opinions. Those elected do not recommend “schemers” who “gamed the system,” preferring to induct the curious and the hardworking students who challenged themselves. We elect PBK Marshals from different disciplines (social sciences, natural sciences, and humanities) so that the selection process can adjust for concentration-level difficulties. Over and above this, the committee looks at two recommendation letters. Our professors are able to distinguish between true scholars and trophy-collecting GPA nuts, and their recommendations reflect this.
The hallowed gates of Harvard Yard instruct us to “Enter to grow in wisdom, leave to better serve thy country.” By lauding those who have made effort to grow in wisdom, we are not diminishing the import of serving our country. It is possible to do both. There is no need to vilify the PBK inductee.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fifty years ago college was a luxury. Back then, you could still graduate from high school and get a good paying job that would guarantee you a place in the middle class. Those days are gone.
A postsecondary education is the ticket to economic success in America. We know that the jobs of the future will all require some kind of education or training after high school.
And while it’s never been more important to have a degree, a certificate or an industry recognized credential—it’s also never been more expensive.
Since 1995, college costs across the country have risen almost five times faster than median household income. As a result, students and their families are taking on more and more debt. Borrowing to pay for college used to be the exception; now it’s the rule.
Next month, millions of America’s newest college graduates will leave school to enter the job market. As they do, a new challenge awaits many of them: how to pay back the student debt they’ve accumulated over the last four years.
Two-thirds of students are borrowing to get their degree, and they’re graduating with more than $26,000 in debt. In an economy still recovering from the worst downturn since the Great Depression, paying off a sum that large can be a daunting.
To make matters worse, a policy change is coming that will make getting out of debt more expensive for over 7 million young Americans: Without Congressional action, the interest rate on subsidized Stafford loans is set to double from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent starting July 1, 2012.
Based on the average loan amount, doubling the subsidized Stafford loan interest rate will add more than $1,000 in total costs.  For students who borrow heavily to go to college, it could cost even more. Only Congress can keep these interest rates from doubling.
Last week, President Obama traveled to universities across the country to call on Congress do its part to keep college affordable by stopping student loan interest rates from doubling this July. With so many students struggling to both make ends meet and afford the skyrocketing price of a college degree, now is not the right time to heap more costs on top of them.
As we work to get the economy back on track, no one is suggesting it would be a good idea to double interest rates on credit cards or home mortgages. Why then do some believe it’s a good idea to double interest rates for students?
We all have a role to play—the President, Congress, parents, students and schools—in making college affordable and keeping the middle class dream alive. Our administration is continuing to do its part: Despite being in one of the most challenging budget environments in history and cutting almost all-domestic spending across the board, President Obama is increasing the investment in higher education.
The Obama Administration is providing billions of dollars a year in aid to needy students through Pell grants and helping students to better manage their debt after graduation with programs like income-based repayment and public service loan forgiveness. The President is also proposing a number of initiatives that would continue to make college more affordable, including doubling the number of work-study jobs within five years; making the American Opportunity Tax Credit permanent; and providing new incentives for states and institutions to keep college costs from escalating.
President Obama cannot—and should not—do this work alone. In 2007, a bipartisan majority in a Democrat-controlled Congress and a Republican president came together to lower interest rates on these loans because it was the right thing to do. This is not about politics. It’s about doing right for America’s students—and for our nation’s economy.
Now Congress has an important decision to make. Do they double interest rates for Stafford loans, adding more debt to students already struggling to make ends meet? Or do they invest in the future by helping to keep interest rates where they are? For me, the choice is clear. We have to educate our way to a better economy. And as President Obama has stepped up to meet the challenge, I hope leaders in Congress will step up as well.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The long-dormant organization Women in Computer Science returned to Harvard this spring.
The group aims to generate enthusiasm among women interested in computer science within and outside of Harvard.
Founders Anne W. Madoff ’15 and Amy M. Yin ’13 decided to revive the group after noticing a need for a female community within the computer science department.
Though the numbers of female concentrators have been generally rising within the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, where computer science is housed, the percentage of women in computer science fell this year, from 42 percent in the Class of 2013 to 22 percent in the Class of 2014, according to computer science professor Harry R. Lewis ’68.
“What happened is we lost one or two women and gained about 15 men,” Lewis said.
Yin said that she believes that the discrepancy can be attributed in part to the low visibility of women within the department.
“Harvard does a good job with classes like CS50 that make computer science accessible to everyone, including women. However, there aren’t many female role models,” she said.
Two of the four female computer science professors on staff are currently on sabbatical, Yin added.
Madoff said that the group hopes to provide a close-knit support system for women in the department. It plans to host speakers, social gatherings, and trips to summits such as the Grace Hopper Women in Computing Conference. Madoff and Yin said they also hope to get pre-college students excited about the field.
“When I was younger, computer science never even crossed my mind because it seemed like something people did alone in dark rooms at 4 in the morning and that didn’t really fit my lifestyle,” said Yin, “Coding will soon become the next typing. We want to emphasize that CS really is something that cool people do.”
Yifan Wu ’14 said that she joined the organization to get to know other women in computer science and benefit from the networking opportunities of an intimate organization
“I feel that I would be able to get a lot of synergy from this group,” Wu said.
Professors and administrators across SEAS have welcomed the revived group.
“This type of peer support is really helpful,” Lewis said. “It’s great that they’re doing this.”
The organization currently meets at the Women’s Center and plans to apply for official recognition from the Committee on Student Life next year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Diana G. Kimball ’09 was in her junior year at Harvard, she got a  phone call from her father. He had just read an article in the Wall  Street Journal announcing a new program at Harvard Business School that  he thought would be perfect for his daughter.
At her father’s recommendation, Kimball read about the 2+2 Program,  which invites students to apply to Harvard Business School in their  senior year of college. Admitted students are asked to spend two years  in the workforce before completing Harvard’s two-year MBA program, hence  the name.
Kimball, a history concentrator at the College, applied and got in.
She spent two years working at Microsoft’s Silicon Valley office and a  short time at a start-up company, but her plan to return to Harvard was  always at the back of her mind. “I entered a romantic relationship  early in my time in San Francisco, and on our first date, I had to  disclose that I was moving in two years. It made it difficult to settle  down in some ways.”
As the first class of students admitted to the 2+2 Program, including  Kimball, wraps up its first year at the Business School, the difficulty  of structuring one’s early post-college years around a two-year plan  has become apparent.
Some students have said they avoid disclosing their acceptance to 2+2  to their potential employers. And others, finding success in the  working world, are not ready to step away after just two years on the  job.
Out of the 106 students who were accepted in 2008 to the first class,  65 showed up at Harvard this year, 40 postponed matriculation, and one  dropped out. For the next class, which is scheduled to arrive on campus  in the fall, more than half have chosen not to come right away.
“The reality is it could be called the X+2 Program,” said Deirdre C.  Leopold, managing director of MBA admissions and financial aid.
“SAME PLACE, DIFFERENT STORY”
Harvard Business School requires most students to enter its MBA  program with at least two years of work experience. The 2+2 Program  opened the door to college-aged applicants.
“We want to get the MBA out there as something for smart and active and committed college students to consider,” Leopold said.
The program classifies admitted students based on their expected year  of graduation from the MBA program. The School is currently selecting  what it terms the 2016 cohort; Kimball’s cohort is 2013.
Harvard College has had a strong showing in the first three cohorts admitted to the program—22 out of 106 students in the 2013 cohort were Harvard undergraduates; 27 of 115 the next year; and about 20 of 100 the year after that.
After two years in San Francisco, Kimball said she has found it  comforting to return to the familiar environment of Harvard. “I think  that same place, different story is the main feeling,” she said.
Lilly Y. Deng ’09, who was accepted to 2+2 at the same time as  Kimball, noted that compared to Harvard College, the Business School  offers a more structured academic experience. She said her classes run  from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. and are almost fully attended—a stark change from  college life.
She also said that she finds the social environment at the Business School more focused on forging new connections.
“At the College, if they weren’t in my concentration, or they weren’t  in my House, or they didn’t live in my dorm as a freshman, it would be  very hard for me to walk up to someone and say, ‘Hey, I’d like to get to  know you better.’ But it’s really easy to start those conversations at  Harvard Business School,” Deng said.
Alexandra Dickson ’09 pointed out that Harvard Business School’s case  study method constitutes a “different type of learning” from what she  experienced at the College. She added that her two years of work  experience at a health care consulting firm assist her in the classroom.
“I think the two years have definitely been very, very valuable,”  Dickson said. “It helps in understanding the interpersonal relationship  piece in classes like leadership or ethics.”
Yet Deng, Dickson, and Kimball represent only a segment of the  population in the initial 2013 cohort. Many of their would-be classmates  told Harvard that they would put off coming back to school, and the  2014 cohort has made the choice to defer their matriculation in even  higher numbers than the first class.
“The majority of 2+2 admits [from the 2014 cohort] are electing to do  a third year of work,” Leopold said. “We’re very flexible [in saying],  ‘Tell us what you need and we’ll work with you.’”
OUT IN THE REAL WORLD
One of the students from the 2013 cohort who chose to postpone  matriculation was Sergio Prado ’09. Prado had joined the staff of a  gaming website called HeavenGames at age 13 and had quickly risen  through its ranks. He became a manager at 15, a board member at 17, the  owner at 18, and the CEO at 20.
Prado said he applied to 2+2 because it placed a focus on drawing  students with technical experience. According to Leopold, the Business  School aims to fill at least half of each cohort with students who have  backgrounds in STEM—Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math.
After graduating from Harvard, Prado worked for a year and a half as a  software engineer at Microsoft. He is currently developing a fitness  start-up that he founded with a friend.
Prado said that he is drawn to the idea of working on start-ups as a  long-term career, and he wanted to have a full experience working in  that arena before he entered Harvard Business School. He recently  decided to defer enrollment for a second year—meaning that for him, the  equation is at least 4+2.
“Based on my understanding, what you get out of business school is  only as much as the experiences you had coming in,” Prado said. “What it  came down to was I believed that the additional experience with a  start-up would be hugely beneficial.”
Leopold said that students like Prado can defer the classroom  component of the program at the Business School’s discretion. “We  evaluate on a case-by-case basis when it goes beyond the three years,”  she said.
If students forgo their admission offers, they forfeit a $1,000 deposit, according to Leopold.
Some admitted students might never make their way to the Business School.
“I think the benefit of being in the 2+2 Program for me was that it  was an option that I had,” said one 2009 Harvard College graduate. “I  put down a deposit, but for me...I didn’t feel that I necessarily had to  go.”
The Harvard alumna deferred matriculation for one year and will  enroll at the Business School in the fall. Like Prado, she said her  primary reason for deferring was to gain additional work experience.
“All I really had to do was send them [the admissions office] an  email telling them I wanted to defer, and I got an email back saying  okay,” she said.
She asked to remain anonymous in this article because she did not  tell her employer that she had been admitted to the 2+2 Program when she  sought one of the three jobs she has held during her three years off.
She was worried about seeming “presumptuous” to her prospective  employer by noting her Harvard Business School admission on her resume,  she said. Others have noted that 2+2 admission, while certainly a mark  of distinction, might also be a hindrance for students’ budding business  careers.
“For some companies, if you had put ‘HBS Admit, Class of 2013,’ they  actually would not have wanted to hire you because they wanted to keep  you for longer than 2 years,” Dickson said, although she said that she  told her employer—a health care consulting firm where she had previously  interned—about her admission.
Kimball noted that the turnover period for many first jobs is around  two to three years anyway and said she was glad she told her manager and  co-workers at Microsoft that she would be heading back to Harvard  eventually.
“If you believe that you’re likely leaving in two years, that’s going  to affect the way you approach your work,” Kimball said. “Your  manager’s going to be better able to help you...if they know that.”
FINE-TUNING THE PROGRAM
As the 2+2 Program enters its fourth year, students have learned how  to navigate the newly created gap between college and an anticipated  Business School start date. Harvard too has adapted the program during  its early experimental years.
In the first year of the program, the Business School offered students help finding employment through career counseling and a recruiting partner system that included companies such as Google, McKinsey & Co., and Teach for America.
Now, Leopold said, “We don’t get involved in that process. Students are required to get their own jobs.”
Harvard also offered summer programs for the first cohort of 2+2  students to practice case studies and network with each other on campus  for a few days. The program has since been discontinued. Leopold said,  “We found over time that they found ways of connecting without us being  involved at all.”
Furthermore, the Business School tweaked the admissions cycle for the program this year, breaking it into three rounds instead of one  application deadline to better match the regular Business School  admissions process.
As administrators fine-tune the infant program, they can only wait to  find out the answer to perhaps the biggest question of all. With no  strict limits on repeated deferrals, only time will tell whether  students selected for 2+2 will indeed eventually enroll or choose to  stay in the working world as their careers develop.
But however many students matriculate and however long it takes them  to get there, the program has succeeded at the goal that Leopold  identified—drawing bright college students to Harvard Business School,  two or more years down the line.
Sitting at the Business School, Kimball reflected on the pilot  program that took her from Harvard to the West Coast and back again.
“I’ve seen the 2+2 population stepping into leadership roles in many  ways, despite our young age,” Kimball said. “I think that HBS is better  for that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In preparation for finals, some students stock up on Red Bull. Others reload their Starbucks cards in anticipation of coffee-fueled nights. But for some students who sneak under the radar at Harvard, reading period entails a trip to the pharmacy or their entryway’s drug dealer.
Jessica, who asked that her name be changed for this article, takes an Adderall extended-release pill when she feels pressure to meet a deadline.
“I think of it as an escape route,” says the freshman. “If I get really desperate I have something that can save me.”
Jessica, who has not been diagnosed with an attention deficit disorder—the condition that Adderall is officially prescribed to treat—only uses the pills when she has a paper due the next day or a big exam to study for. Since she does not have a prescription, Jessica buys Adderall XR—usually at a cost of $5 per 20-milligram pill—from her peers.
Adderall XR came onto the market in 2001 and quickly passed Ritalin to become the most popular “study drug,” according to a 2006 study by Northeastern University professor Christian Teter.
As an amphetamine, the drug is classified alongside cocaine and opium as a Schedule II controlled substance by the Drug Enforcement Agency. But for harried students seeking improved concentration, alertness, and even a sense of euphoria, the threat of the law serves as little deterrent to taking the little orange pill.
A DARKER SHADE OF ORANGE
Bianca, another freshman whose name has been changed, reflects on her first experience taking Adderall soon after she started high school.
“It just felt so, so good,” she says. “Even though I couldn’t sleep, it felt awesome. After that I started taking it a lot. During the next two months, I took it every day.”
Bianca started using the drug to help her with her schoolwork, then came to rely on it more when she realized it doubled as a weight loss method. But she soon learned first-hand why Schedule II drugs including Adderall are considered to have a high potential for abuse.
She found herself hospitalized in ninth grade. Two months of daily use had taken their toll: her weight had plummeted from 130 to 94 pounds, and she had not had a full night of sleep in weeks.
“By the time I was actually hospitalized, I was kind of fucked up,” she admits with a slight laugh. “I wanted more weight loss—that was one reason for taking it—but I also had become psychologically dependent on it. I really loved it.”
Though she obtained her Adderall legally—she was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder after her parents divorced when she was ten—Bianca had saved her first bottle of pills, only turning to the drug in high school on the eve of a big paper deadline.
Before Bianca’s hospitalization, her concerned mother scheduled regular meetings for her daughter at an eating disorder clinic, but Bianca found ways to trick her doctors.
“I would stop taking the medicine two days before a meeting so that I would not have the amphetamine in my blood,” she recalls.
Bianca was able to quit Adderall after her stay in the hospital, but when college applications hit during her senior year she felt it was “really urgent” to finish everything in time. She returned to her doctor for a refill and was surprised by how easy it was to get the pills, given her history of abuse.
“He didn’t verify anything,” she says. “He gave me a ton of Adderall—over 90 capsules at a time. It was a really ridiculous amount, and I saved them all up.”
Soon Bianca found herself in a dangerous cycle: a pill in the morning would prevent her from sleeping at night, and she found the only way to avoid being tired the day after was to take more Adderall. When she came to Harvard, she brought a stash of more than 100 pills with her.
She stopped taking them after her boyfriend threatened to end their relationship if she continued.
“There are days when taking Adderall would be a smart choice for that day, when it really would make me so much more productive, but I think for me it has been a really good decision not to take it,” she says now.
Bianca sold her remaining pills for $250 to a fellow freshman—Jessica.
“It’s not something I use all the time, but it’s there for me to fall back on,” Jessica says.
SIDE EFFECTS MAY INCLUDE
“There is a prevailing notion that since doctors prescribe medications such as Adderall, that they must be safe,” University Health Services spokesperson Nanci Martin writes in an e-mailed statement. But despite this perception, Martin writes that stimulants like Adderall can cause cardiac problems.
Harvard Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors outline further risks of stimulants like Adderall on their website—including addiction, stroke, psychosis, and schizophrenia.
But labels and doctor warnings fail to prevent some students from popping pills. Though statistics on Adderall misuse vary widely, studies show that prescription drug abuse occurs on campuses across the country.
The 2009 National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that 6.4 percent of full-time college students age 18 to 22 misused Adderall that year. The number did not include students diagnosed with an attention deficit disorder, even though experts claim that some students fake symptoms in order to get study pills.
Closer to home, a 2011 survey by the Boston Globe found that among an “informal sampling” of students at four Boston-area colleges, 15 percent admitted to taking prescription drugs, most frequently Adderall, for stress relief, increased focus, and other unintended purposes.
Peter, a junior whose name has been changed, worries that doctors might discover long-term effects in the future, even though his occasional use of Adderall has not produced any immediate side effects.
“There is no way you can take a drug to make your brain work at twice the speed and intensity as normal without having some consequences,” he says.
THIS IS YOUR BRAIN ON ADDERALL
Despite concerns about Adderall abuse, Stanford law professor Henry Greely argues that using prescription drugs to boost studying should be as commonly accepted as drinking caffeine.
Greely and his six co-authors said in a 2008 article in Nature that study pills like Adderall have “much to offer individuals and society.”
The article counters critics of study pills who charge that they are “unnatural” by pointing out that nearly every aspect of modern life—food, shelter, clothing, medical care—bears “little relation to our species’ ‘natural’ state.”
These drugs “should be viewed in the same general category as education, good health habits, and information technology—ways that our uniquely innovative species tries to improve itself,” says the article.
Peter disagrees. Even though he uses study pills to increase concentration, he admits that their use on college campuses gives students unfair advantages.
“Adderall is absolutely cheating,” he says. “Coffee and other natural stimulants keep you awake, but Adderall keeps you focused. I read an entire course’s assigned reading in a five-hour period. That is not natural. That was cheating.”
Jessica has a different take. “I don’t think it’s cheating to take study drugs,” she says. “But I do admit that I sometimes get annoyed with people who fake a prescription. They get extra time on tests, and I think a lot of people get prescribed Adderall knowing full well they do not have ADD.”
As Jessica knows from first-hand experience, Adderall’s power to increase focus comes at a mental as well as physical cost. The drug is known to impair creativity and alter thought patterns.
“The papers I write on Adderall are nowhere near the same quality as the ones I write not on Adderall,” she says. “They are wordy and convoluted. It’s like I can’t step back and see the big picture, but at the time it feels like I’m writing smart stuff.”
Yet time-crunched students juggling competitive classes, leadership positions, job and graduate school applications, and social lives turn to study pills for an extra edge anyway.
As Jessica puts it, “desperate times call for desperate measures.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Robots playing soccer, medical device prototypes, and visualization demos were among dozens of projects on display at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Design Fair on Tuesday.
The fair, in its inaugural year, took place in Maxwell Dworkin, showcasing student creativity through project posters, exhibitions, and interactive demonstrations.
More than ten SEAS undergraduate design courses were represented, with projects focusing in applied mathematics, the engineering sciences, and computer science.
Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering assistant professor Conor J. Walsh said that the fair was a great opportunity for students to show off their work and raise awareness of the exciting opportunities that are available within SEAS.
“The faculty and staff in SEAS are really excited about incorporating more hands-on design projects into the various classes,” Walsh said, “I think that it will get students really excited about design and help create engineers that can work on real-world problems even before they graduate.”
Students drew upon lessons learned in a variety of classes to implement their projects, many of which spanned across disciplines.
“My project drew from many different classes I have taken throughout my time at Harvard,” said Jennifer A. Xia ’12, who showcased her thesis, an investigation into the factors that go into Facebook friendship creation at Harvard.
“Certainly a little bit of computer science for the programming aspect, a little bit of applied math for the modeling part, a little statistics and sociology,” Xia said.
The projects also allowed students such as Michaela S. Tracy ’13 to explore their personal interests from unconventional perspectives.
Tracy, a singer and composer, explored her love of music by modeling the movement of musical chords and recreating different melodies in Applied Mathematics 120: ”Applicable Linear Algebra.”
Though the fair focused on projects within SEAS courses, the participating students represented a variety of academic backgrounds outside the department.
Kayla M. Shelton ’13, an engineering sciences concentrator who built an LED cube with philosophy concentrator Aruna Gnanasekaran ’12, said that she benefited greatly from the diversityof students within Engineering Sciences 50: “Introduction to Electrical Engineering.”
“It’s incredible to meet and work with interesting people pursuing concentrations outside of the sciences,” Shelton said. “It really speaks to the importance of having design skill with respect to taking on the world.”
For many students, the fair represented the culmination of months of planning, testing their ideas, debugging, and rebuilding. Mubeen M. Tejani ’14, who built a laser harp for ES50, said that one of the greatest challenges was adapting his project to fit the hardware constraints.
“In computer science, you know your hardware’s going to work. It’s only a matter of software. In engineering, you can’t assume that,” Tejani said. Students echoed his sense of fulfillment gained from their projects.
“The biggest reward was seeing it finally work,” Luis F. Duarte ’13 said of the interactive mobile “Battleships” application that he designed for Computer Science 164: “Mobile Software Engineering.”
“You have this idea in your head and you spend time figuring out how to execute it. But once it’s actually there, you can have fun with it,” Duarte added. “That’s the reward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Starting Wednesday, students will be able to submit designs for the new face of my.harvard.edu to the Harvard Student Information Technology Advisory Committee, marking the first time that Harvard University will use student feedback to design the site.
The winner of the contest will receive a $200 prize and their name will be featured on the new site’s home page. HUIT hopes that the new design will be implemented this summer and be ready for student use by the start of the fall semester, according to Michael C. George ’14, a student on the Student IT Advisory Committeee who is also a Crimson editor.
The competition, which is the first step in a larger move towards a more effective my.harvard.edu, is part of an effort on the part of HUIT to incorporate student voices, George said.
“The redesign contest will help us improve the ‘look’ of my.harvard, and the underlying technology will remain the same for the time being,” Managing Director of Academic Technology for HUIT, Samantha Earp, wrote in an email to HUIT Communications Officer Nicholas L. Connors that was forwarded to The Crimson. “That said, we are in the initial stages of the larger undertaking of rethinking what an ideal student portal would look like.”
Committee member Shirley Zhou ’13 also emphasized that the competition is a revolutionary move.
“They have never taken student user feedback,” Zhou said. “This is a huge step for them.”
More in-depth changes, Zhou said, will likely include the introduction of a central page where links to important information like exam dates and the academic calendar will be located, as well the addition of student-generated content like event posters to the front page.
Many of Zhou’s friends, she said, use Google to find information like exam dates.
“For students, it’s often a challenge to navigate this Byzantine network,” George said.
My.harvard.edu was created nearly a decade ago, and the last overhaul of the site took place in 2004. A student-generated website meant to provide a more user-friendly substitute for my.harvard.edu was shut-down by Harvard in 2007 for legal reasons.
Students on the advisory committee proposed a design competition after about 160 students voted on 47 suggestions for changes to HUIT services. The most heavily supported initiative was a change to the Pre-Term Planning tool, closely followed by changes to my.harvard.edu.
“The technology landscape changes very quickly,” Earp wrote. “My.harvard, while an excellent technology, is several years old and could use an update in terms of look and feel.”
The competition, which opens Wednesday, will close on June 15. All students, whether they have technical knowledge or not, are encouraged to submit designs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 2, 2012, at 6:47 a.m.
A full house of faculty members nearly forced a motion to delay the elimination of the Financial Planning Group—announced in an email to faculty by Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 on Friday—by six months at Tuesday’s Faculty Meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
They also unanimously approved the passage of new concentrations in Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering, both to be offered by the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
The meeting, which is the last of the semester, also saw the approval of courses of instruction for 2012-2013 across the University and at the University Extension School. It concluded with an update by Garber and Senior Associate Provost for the Harvard Library Mary Lee Kennedy on the restructuring of the Harvard Library.
MONEY MANAGEMENT
Although the motion to delay the closing of the FPG, which required a four-fifths vote from the 167 faculty present to pass, was not approved, many faculty members were visibly upset that the office will be shut down effective June 30 of this year.
Four faculty members sent questions about the issue to University President Drew G. Faust in advance of the meeting, and four others raised new concerns at the meeting itself—in excess of the normal two extemporaneous questions allowed by the Faculty Meeting rules during Question Period.
Professors cited the critical role the FPG has played in helping faculty manage retirement funds and plan major investment decisions.
Jeffrey F. Hamburger, professor of German art and culture, added that the services offered by the FPG—which have, in the past, been explicitly offered to ladder faculty in their contracts—are often a critical recruiting tool when attracting new faculty to the University.
“I know many faculty who would not have been able to contemplate a move to this expensive part of the country without financial advice,” he said.
Faculty called for an explanation of how the University would maintain the services offered by the FPG—or provide alternatives.
“This is not a cost issue; it’s a liability issue,” Garber said. By paying for the service of financial advice to faculty members, he said, Harvard could be held accountable for investment mistakes made by faculty. “It’s a very exposed position for the University to be in,” he continued, adding that no other University in the Ivy Plus consortium has a similar service.
According to David I. Laibson, professor of economics, the University has negotiated with multiple retirement providers, including Vanguard, Fidelity, and TIAA–CREF to provide personalized services to faculty.
But some faculty expressed concern that advisors at these companies would be operating under conflicts of interest to maximize their sales, an issue that both Garber and Laibson agreed should be addressed.
As evidenced by German professor Peter J. Burgard’s motion to delay FPG’s end and establish a committee, including faculty, to discuss alternatives, faculty members were largely unsatisfied by the solutions proposed by Garber and Laibson. They also expressed frustration that the announcement was made so late in the year.
“Why was the faculty not consulted?” asked Burgard.
Garber admitted that the announcement could have been handled with greater tact.
“Our goal was to communicate the decision to discontinue this service and the reasons behind it, and we feel badly that this was not announced to you,” he said, citing a shrinking number of faculty members using the service as one reason why the news was delayed.
ENGINEERS REJOICE!
Along with approving the courses for instruction for the 2012-2013 academic year at the University and the Extension School, faculty members also unanimously voted to introduce two new undergraduate concentrations in electrical and mechanical engineering.
Both concentrations, which will be reviewed again in five years, will allow students to pursue Bachelors of Sciences degrees. The S.B. degrees each require 20 half-courses, a number mandated by the accrediting organization ABET. ABET accreditation will allow students to use their S.B. degrees to pursue licenseship and postgraduate study in their respective fields.
The motion to add the new undergraduate programs was first introduced in the last faculty meeting, during which a number of humanities professors raised concerns that the heavy course requirements of new degrees could potentially detract from the scope of a student’s “liberal arts” education.
In response to a request for statistics on the average number of electives S.B. concentrators currently take and the total number of S.B. concentrators who completed 9th and 10th terms at the school, Assistant Dean of Academic Programs Gu-Yeon Wei said concentrators take an average of 5-6 electives and that a number do take extra semesters.
Although professors who raised concerns emphasized that they would vote in favor of their new concentrations, they questioned the trend of students taking less electives outside of their fields.
“It tends to suggest that most of our students are overwhelmingly studying what they are already comfortable and familiar with,” said English professor James Engell, admitting that this trend affects students in all disciplines. “Their adventuresomeness in fields outside of their area is limited.”
“I think we all have a lot of soul-searching to do about how we advise students,” he said.
PORTAL TO A NEW LIBRARY
In an update to the faculty on the library restructuring process, Garber said the Library Board—which now meets biweekly—has not finalized which positions will be vacated.
Of 280 library staff eligible for the Voluntary Early Retirement Incentive Program announced in February, 64 opted to participate, according to Garber, although that number could still increase.
The Board is also working to improve the “public interface of the library” through the design of library portals for faculty and students. An introductory portal that was introduced last week for faculty to advise on the design process has already received comments from 60 faculty members, Garber said. A similar portal for students, Tellus, will also launch shortly.
However, professors at the meeting also stood up to reiterate concerns over staff demoralization in the face of future library staff layoffs.
“I’m worried about the bodies that are getting thrown under the wheels in the process,” Hamburger said. “The recent retirement plan does not sit well with a rationalized reform process.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Office of Student Life allocated approximately $30,000 to book artists for Yardfest this year, a sum that planners said limited their ability to attract big name perfomers, according to a number of students with knowledge of Yardfest planning.
Many students complained about this year’s artist lineup, which included The Cataracs, Das Racist, and 3LAU.
Students involved in the College Events Board and Harvard College Concert Commission, the two organizations responsible for planning Yardfest, said they were severely limited by their budget.
CEB Co-Chair Emily S. Rutter ’13, who is also a Crimson sports editor, spoke positively of the administration’s interactions with the CEB but said that their planning was hindered by a low budget.
“As a leader of the CEB, I feel that the budget we are given is not enough,” Rutter wrote in an email. “We allocate our budget to several college-wide events; but with Yardfest, an event that is arguably our biggest, I think that we should be given more money to put into it so we get an even better result.“
According to the website for Pretty Polly Productions, which several students said the College uses to book artists for Yardfest, the Cataracs charge between $15,000 and $25,000 and Das Racist between $7,500 and $10,000 per show. 3LAU was not listed on the Pretty Polly website.
While other schools allow the organizers of spring concerts to raise revenue by charging for tickets, students said that Harvard’s administration does not allow the CEB or HCC to do the same.
Students used to be charged for tickets to Springfest—the event that Yardfest replaced in 2006. According to Assistant Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich, lackluster attendence and sporadic ticket sales at Springfest were among the reasons why the College decided to stop charging admission.
“It is clear that no artist lineup will make everyone happy, but food, music, friends, and games in the Yard can bring the campus community together.” Friedrich wrote in an email. “The opportunity for every student to attend Yardfest without charge is an important value that informs how the event is planned for our community.”
Friedrich declined to comment on the size of Yardfest’s budget.
Students said that beyond being limited by money, many artists were unavailable because this year’s Yardfest overlapped with the weekend of the Coachella Music Festival. The administration determines the time and the location of Yardfest.
Other schools have different models for organizing their spring concerts. The University of Pennsylvania charges $35 general admission to its Spring Fling concert, which featured Passion Pit and Tiësto this year. The bulk of the funding for Yale University’s Spring Fling comes from a student activities fee of $75 that undergraduates can choose to opt out of. Yale’s 2012 concert included T-Pain, Passion Pit, and 3LAU.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Medical School professor emeritus C. Miller Fisher, whose commitment to clinical observation revolutionized the study of stroke while helping to raise a new generation of neurologists at Massachusetts General Hospital, died April 14 in Albany, New York. He was 98 years old.
Fisher’s death was confirmed by his daughter, Elizabeth Fisher ’63, on Tuesday, who said that her father died of the cumulative effects of old age.
“Arguably in the 20th century, he’s the finest physician that ever lived, both as a brilliant clinician, as a caregiver to his patients, and as an outstanding academician,” said neurology professor J. Phillip Kistler ’60, who worked closely with Fisher at MGH.
Beginning in the early 1950s, a string of successful research earned Fisher a reputation as the father of cardiovascular diagnosis and treatment. First at Montreal Memorial Hospital and then at MGH, Fisher studied and described the pathological details of each of the sub-types of ischemic stroke, building up an unprecedented body of knowledge.
“Over the course of 50 years, many of the essential thoughts and names given to the conditions of strokes came from his hand,” neurology professor Joseph B. Martin said.
Among his now-foundational findings, Fisher identified and named transient ischemic attacks—pre-stroke warning signs used to diagnose a stroke victim—and closely studied the links between strokes and arterial blockage, which allowed doctors to prevent subsequent strokes in patients.
“[His work has] allowed physicians to make sense of the causes of all varieties of stroke and neurological disease,” Kistler said, information that was not available before Fisher’s research.
Charles Miller Fisher was born Dec. 5, 1913 in Waterloo, Ontario. He graduated from the University of Toronto Medical School before serving as a surgical lieutenant in the British Royal and Canadian Navies. His ship, the HMS Voltaire, was sunk off the coast of Cape Verde in 1941, and Fisher was held in a Nazi prison camp for the next three and a half years.
After the war, Fisher returned to Canada and then to Boston and MGH, where he ultimately spent more than 50 years serving as both a teacher and clinician.
Fisher’s tireless curiosity and the long hours that he worked at MGH were legendary, former colleagues said. Dropped off by his wife around mid-morning each day, he often remained at the hospital well after midnight talking with students or observing stroke patients.
“He had an infinite sense of what it took, what it meant to understand, to learn,” said neurology professor Verne S. Caviness, who was a resident under Fisher. “He always said if you were to spend 48 hours at the bedside...you would see all of neurology flow before you.”
Fisher’s careful study, along with the work of MGH neurologist Raymond B. Adams, gave rise to a new, modern generation of neurological study.
“Not only did he create a legacy of his own work, but he created a whole generation of people who went on to do their own,” said Jay P. Mohr, one of Fisher’s former students.
Fisher’s awards were numerous and his reputation far-reaching. He received the Royal College of Physicians of Canada’s Prize in Medicine in 1952 and was inducted to the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame in 1998. Many conditions and tests bearing his name can be found in the field of neurology—a testament to the breadth of his impact.
Former colleagues remembered Fisher as a dedicated seeker of truth, loath of the “simple” answer, who gave his life to his patients and his work, sometimes at the expense of his personal life, but always with a sense of humor.
A dogged writer, Fisher was at work on the sixth volume of his memoirs when he died, friends said. In an essay in the journal Stroke in 2001, Fisher reflected on his prodigious run as a teacher and clinician.
“Is it a matter of striving? Not really, for in retrospect it seems to have been effortless,” Fisher wrote. “If there is a dictum, it would be that it is all a matter of being in the right place, at the right time, with the right mentor.”
Fisher was preceded in death by his wife of 68 years, Doris M. Fisher. He is also survived by two sons and a daughter.
A memorial service will be held at 11 a.m. on May 12 at the Winchester Unitarian Society.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time this year, Faculty of Arts and Science members cleaned up an entire tray of cookies before exiting University Hall after yesterday’s faculty meeting.
The semester’s last meeting drew the largest crowd since last December, when the courses of Harvard Summer School instructor Subramaniam Swamy were removed from the catalogue.
Late attendees lined up against the walls of the meeting room, and some professors even found themselves taking seats on the floor.
Some came to question the University’s recent decision to discontinue the University’s Financial Planning Group, while others came to discuss the administration’s handling of the ongoing library transition.
A contingent from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences was also present to support the passage of two new concentrations: Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering.
Still, others—including students, lecturers, and teaching fellows—were invited as recipients of a number of teaching, advising, and mentoring awards announced by Dean of FAS Michael D. Smith.
ORDER, ORDER
In addition to dealing with a packed hall and a packed agenda, the administrators present handled an intense introductory question period. University President Drew G. Faust even recognized more than the two “extemporaneous” questions normally permitted by parliamentary procedure.
“We have a very full docket, and we need to address academic issues that are relevant to summer school and next year,” she said.
Faust emphasized the need for faculty members to keep their questions brief, and had to interrupt multiple professors attempting to discuss the closure of the Financial Planning Group, which offers retirement and investment advice to Harvard employees.
“You are a brilliant literary scholar,” Faust said jokingly to one long-winded faculty member. “A question ends with a question mark.”
ITCHY FEET
By the time University Librarian Robert C. Darnton was poised to take the microphone and explain the Faculty Advisory Council’s opinion on open access, administrators at the head table were getting restless. It was 5:30 p.m., and in keeping with procedure, the Docket Committee would have to call a motion to extend the meeting another fifteen minutes—an unprecedented request this semester.
Only a few faculty members raised their hands in the traditional vote. Instead, more than half “voted with their feet,” as Faust described—leaving the Hall as Faust agreed to let the meeting continue.
While faculty members continued to debate the treatment of library employees and restructuring efforts by the administration, their discourse would not further exceed the afternoon’s allotted time.
The meeting was adjourned promptly at 5:45 p.m.

Approximately 70 Harvard affiliates arrived in Boston bright and early Friday morning to participate in Boston Shines, a city-wide clean-up and beautification initiative spanning every Boston neighborhood.
Harvard—which has been heavily involved in the project since it’s inception 10 years ago—produced volunteers from across a variety of schools and from the Allston businesses for which it currently serves as a landlord, including the environmentally focused non-profit Earth Watch.
Volunteers participated in a number of beautification activities, including raking leaves, painting dugouts and benches, and cleaning sidewalks.  Notable activities included clean-ups of Hooker-Sorrento Park, Smith Field, and Barry’s Corner, and the beautification and preparation of a learning garden for students at the Gardner Pilot Academy. Christine Heenan, Harvard Vice President for Communications and Public Affairs, emphasized the importance of Boston Shines as a way for Harvard to engage positively with the community, especially as they continue to develop and lease properties in Boston.
“We’re really proud to be making contributions to the community in a sustained and meaningful way,” Heenan said. “Since last year’s Boston Shines, we’ve celebrated the opening of the iLab, Stone Hearth Pizza, and Library Park. This is one more way for us to affirm our connection to the Boston community, and there’s even more to come next year.”
Harvard Business School employee and Allston Resident Paula M. Alexander, who participated in the event, said that she felt it was important for Harvard to continue to give back to the Boston community, especially in Allston, because of their continuing development in the area.
“Harvard has expanded so much into that area, that I think it’s not only great, but necessary that they continue to give back to the local community,” Alexander said.
Alexander added that she feels that the giving back allows many Boston residents to feel more comfortable with Harvard’s “immense” local presence.
“I think a lot of people feel a lot more comfortable with having Harvard in the area, or down the street, or next door when they see them out here, participating, and helping out in the community,” Alexander said.  “It really helps with their reputation among local residents.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A report released Tuesday by the Tellus Institute alleged that the Boards of Trustees of many of Massachusetts’s wealthiest colleges and universities, including Harvard, have conflicts of interests with companies with which the institutions do business. The report also stated that these institutions have failed to clearly report those relationships on documents required by the Internal Revenue Service and state attorney general.
The report, which sampled the 20 wealthiest colleges and universities in Massachusetts, named four “worst offenders,” including Harvard University, Boston University, Tufts University, and Williams College for providing “substantially problematic responses that raise major questions in both state and federal filings for 2009 and 2010.”
Acccording to the report, 70 percent of the schools sampled have at least one trustee affiliated with a company doing business with that same institution. Harvard, the report says, failed to disclose the names of board members who were involved with “related party transactions” with the University.
It found that only two of the universities sampled—Brandeis University and Northeastern University–gave “substantially clear responses” on the documents that they filed.
The report concludes that leading private colleges in Massachusetts interact with trustee-affiliated business far more than their counterparts nationwide, referencing a 2010 study by The Chronicle of Higher Education, which reported that a quarter of private colleges nationally did business with trustee-affiliated companies.
Richard J. Doherty ’76, president of the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities in Massachusetts, said that these percentages would likely have been much closer had more than 20 schools been included in the study.
The report also concluded that “the current transparency system is simply not working,” given that only a few of the schools in the study fully disclosed potential conflicts of interests.
Harvard’s Director of News and Media Relations Kevin Galvin wrote in an email to the Crimson that the policy of the Harvard Management Company is designed to prevent conflicts of interest.
“HMC has a robust and comprehensive conflict of interest policy, which specifically requires board members to be recused from any decisisions that may pose a conflict,” the email stated. “All tax filings and disclosure forms are completed in full accordance with all IRS and state requirements.”
Doherty said the report dealt only with potential, not actual, conflicts of interest, and that the IRS procedures had been recently updated before the time period that the report concerns. Furthermore, he said the procedures could have been interpreted in different ways.
“When you look at the institutions that we’re talking about, they have some of the finest accounting, financial, and legal professionals in the country,” Doherty said. “When somebody makes a chart that the disclosures are problematic, I would say, ‘problematic to who[m]?’”
The report was funded by Service Employees International Union Local 615, a union that represents workers at Harvard, according to Wayne M. Langley, the director of higher education for Local 615. Langley said that the union, along with about a dozen other groups, is currently sponsoring a state bill requiring more transparency about college finances.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the moments before the Harvard men’s rugby team’s final match, its coach, David Gonzales, made a big announcement to the team: The rugby program plans to raise money to build a new home for Harvard rugby.
“We were all freaking out and really excited when he told us,” player Willie J. Pirc ’15 said.
But stadiums are not built with excitement, so the team’s hope of a new place to play cannot be realized unless it lines up sufficient donations. While the plan is still in its infancy, captain Jaime A. Zobel de Ayala ’13 expressed excitement about the prospect of a new facility.
“This would be a substantial step towards what we want for the rugby program,” Zobel de Ayala said. “It’d be huge.”
The team is now taking its first steps on the long road to setting foot on a new field.
“At this point, we are just starting our fundraising campaign, with the field being one of the primary goals of it,” said Sarah E. L. Macvicar ’13, the president of the women’s rugby team. “It’s definitely one of those things that are going to take time.”
Pirc said that a new field would be a welcome improvement. “[Our current field] is not a very quality field,” he said. “Whenever it rains, it gets totally torn up. We usually play in the mud a lot.” He and Zobel de Ayala both noted that the men’s rugby team sometimes plays its games on another team’s field.
Zobel de Ayala added that a new stadium would bring upgrades beyond the playing surface. “We have a little shed for most of our supplies, and we take care of what we have, but we don’t have a lot,” he said.
Pirc said he also thought that a new stadium might bring more attention to the program. “We hope that with a new field, rugby will become a spectator sport. It’s been a tradition at Harvard for 140 years, and it’s a fun sport to watch, so I feel like it could become something the student body would come to.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: MAY 4, 2012, AT 3:56 A.M.
Come fall, anyone with an internet connection will have the opportunity to take classes from two of the world’s most prestigious universities.
Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced Wednesday that the two institutions will spend $30 million each to launch a joint online platform that makes lecture videos, class exercises, and quizzes available online to learners anywhere.
The digital courses will be free. But for a fee—which administrators said has not yet been determined—participants will have the option of receiving a certificate of mastery for completing a course.
Administrators said that these certificates will not count for credit toward a Harvard or MIT degree in the immediate future and that certificates will bear Harvardx and MITx monikers instead of the names of their parent institutions.
“There’s great excitement, on both sides, to have this impact not only what we’re doing on campus but to really change the way education is done across the world,” Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith said in a conference call with reporters.
Both institutions said that they plan to use the project—called edX in homage to MITx, the online learning portal that MIT launched this year—as a laboratory for their researchers to study how virtual learners interact with the system.
Researchers will be able to observe the amount of time students spend watching and rewinding videos and to examine correlations between students’ preferred learning methods and their performance on assessment.
“This is about experimentation; it’s about research; it’s about rethinking education,” said Harvard Provost Alan M. Garber ’76.
Steve Hargadon, founder of education website Classroom 2.0, said he believed that edX’s research function could improve learning for students taking courses both on campus and online.
“The truth is that a Harvard or MIT education is largely about the relationships and proximity that you have. How do you do this on the web? Well, we’re not sure.” said Hargadon, who is also the director of education project Web 2.0 Labs. “This [method] acknowledges that you can’t just put content online and have it make an impact.”
Administrators said that they hope that other universities will eventually join Harvard and MIT in offering courses on edX. As open source software, edX can be freely accessed and improved by other institutions.
MIT’s similar platform, which boasts instant feedback and modules that let students learn at their own pace, has had 120,000 students enroll since it debuted in February. Harvard currently offers courses online using a different platform through Harvard Extension School and Harvard Business School.
The new $60 million edX project will be managed by a nonprofit organization headed by Anant Agarwal, MIT’s director of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and overseen equally by the two schools.
Though most experts said they believed that the introduction of edX signals a dramatic development in virtual education, they agreed that the traditional model of campus-based learning is not going anywhere soon.
“I would imagine that the bricks-and-mortar model will always have a place,” said Martha Stone Wiske, a lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Education who researches technology and innovation. “There is something very beneficial in being able to exchange ideas face to face.”
David A. Wiley, associate professor of instructional psychology and technology at Brigham Young University, described the new offerings as another option in the “ecosystem” of higher education.
Despite the lofty aims of the new program, many practical aspects of its implementation still remain undecided.
“As you can detect, there’s a lot of questions that are unanswered as of today. That’s deliberate,” Garber said. “We need our faculty to be deeply engaged in the shaping of Harvardx.”
Administrators said that they will announce Harvardx’s fall course offerings over the summer. In a letter to Harvard faculty, Smith wrote that East Asian languages and civilizations professor Peter K. Bol, University Professor Gary King, and Computer Science Lecturer David J. Malan ’99 have agreed to consider how they may offer their courses through edX.
In the letter, Smith framed edX as a necessary adapation to Harvard maintaining its academic excellence.
“At every turning point, Harvard has always chosen to move forward,” Smith wrote. “By using these new technologies and the research they will make possible, we will be able to inform the conversation on technology-enabled teaching and at the same time provide virtual access to some of the best educational resources in the world.”
In a Crimson interview, University President Drew G. Faust spoke last week of higher education’s shift into the virtual realm.
“We are in a moment of transformation and we’re all sorting through the implications—how it will change what we’ll do in ways that expand what’s available to students enormously, but also expand the possibilities for higher education for people who have never had access to them before.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“If you ain’t first, you’re last.” –Ricky Bobby.
Eight of Harvard’s 41 varsity teams have waited more than 20 years since their last league title. Before men’s basketball’s triumphs these last two years, that number was nine.
Much has been written about what the athletic department and Friends of Harvard Basketball did to ignite Harvard’s previously moribund basketball program. But where is the similar movement for other struggling programs across the river?
Granted, the eight teams—men’s and women’s cross country, men’s and women’s lacrosse, men’s and women’s outdoor track and field, men’s indoor track and field, and men’s golf—are not as high profile as men’s basketball, but shouldn’t the goal of each program be the same? The first lesson that the Harvard athletic department’s mission statement highlights is “the pursuit of excellence.” Though it qualifies that “winning is not an end in itself,” the statement goes on to claim that “we believe that the efforts by our intercollegiate teams to be their best will lead them to succeed.”
In an eight-team conference, a 40 year gap between championships—which is what men’s cross country will have suffered if they do not conquer the ancient eight next fall—is, to put it bluntly, a failure in that pursuit. (If there’s any silver lining, Yale hasn’t won since 1960, and even then they shared the title with Army, which used to compete in the Ivy League in certain sports).
The very same thing could have been written about men’s basketball just a few years ago. The last 40 years of men’s cross country have been dominated by Princeton and Dartmouth, much the same way men’s basketball has traditionally been dominated by Princeton and Penn. Harvard’s coaches, athletes and alums should take inspiration from the basketball program as an example of what is possible when there is a concerted effort to break the status quo.
This is not to say I am an advocate of increasing athletic department spending or lowering admissions standards. Rather, I’m suggesting that coaches and athletes should have as much support as needed in attempting to actually put their best possible team on the field, track, or course.
Men’s volleyball had not beaten conference-rival Princeton since 1993 before defeating them last spring. This year, they were nationally ranked for the first time in program history en route to an 18-6 record—all of this happening despite, according to the Equity in Athletics program run by the Department of Education, Harvard’s spending on volleyball remaining virtually the same. Whether it was recruiting more heavily from the west coast—half of the team hails from California or Hawaii—or scheduling tougher competition—the team has traveled to California the past two spring breaks—there is clearly something that head Coach Brian Baise, now in his fourth season at the helm, is doing right.
Similar success stories abound across the athletic department, and yet some sports appear to remain content with their mediocrity. Athletics provide benefits to the campus community beyond the win-loss column, but as former NFL head coach Herm Edwards famously declared, “You play to win the game.”
Harvard’s sports are not competing against the Ohio States and Texas’s of the world, where it cannot match its opponents’ athletic spending or cultural relevance, in order to win the Ivy League. Triumph over similarly academically-oriented, relatively small, private universities in the northeast is a realistic and attainable goal. There is no universal formula for success, but if a course or program of study within an academic department were consistently underperforming for upwards of four decades, I’m guessing said department would do all that it could to assess its shortcomings and attempt to reverse the trend.
A prime example of this transition resides within what the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences has gone through in the past decade or so. While I allow that training highly capable engineers serves a greater social good than beating Penn on the golf course, the motivations behind it are the same. Harvard saw itself at a competitive disadvantage, assessed the reasons behind this, and made all necessary efforts to mitigate that.
What has worked for basketball, volleyball, and engineering can and should work for track and lacrosse. The athletic department claims to work towards the growth and self-betterment of all individuals associated with it. If part of that betterment involves winning, then the athletic department should truly get behind all of its programs in their pursuit of victory. Athletics are often cited as a virtue of a well-rounded individual. It should stand to reason that the athletic department should similarly aim to be well-rounded.

Coming into this year's NFL Draft, defensive tackle Josue Ortiz ’11 thought that a late-round selection was a possibility.
At the very least, the former Harvard standout expected to sign a free agent contract, even telling The Crimson last week that he would be “shocked” if he had not signed somewhere by May 1.
“Before the draft, I had been contacted by several teams just discussing potentially being drafted or being offered a free agent contract,” Ortiz said Tuesday afternoon. “During the draft, I got one phone call [from the Patriots] just seeing what my situation was.”
But things didn’t turn out as Ortiz had hoped.
Ultimately not taken in the draft, which ran from April 26-28, Ortiz failed to sign a free agent contract afterwards.
The 6’5”, 253-pound defensive tackle believed he wasn't signed in part because, based on player evaluations, “There was a high quantity of players who also have the same skill set that I do.”
But NFL teams are still interested in the reigning Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year. Ortiz will participate in rookie mini-camps with the New York Jets this coming weekend and with the Chicago Bears from May 10-12.
“They call it a tryout, so presumably if you do well enough, they’ll sign me afterwards,” Ortiz said.  “It’s just a competition, and I’m just focused on being as ready as I can be.”
Ortiz’s teammate, senior left tackle Kevin Murphy, signed a free agent contract with the San Francisco 49ers on Saturday and will partake in his team’s mini-camps starting either May 10 or 11.

Rapper  David Banner visited Harvard last weekend to speak at a conference entitled, "LA Riots: Twenty Year Later," a reflection on social  justice and inequality in America in  the aftermath of the Los Angeles riots in 1992. Flyby sat down to talk  with the successful rapper, producer, and social activist, who has worked  to raise awareness about the shooting of Trayvon Martin.
 
 
1. Flyby: What  do you feel is the most pressing or important problem in our society  now, and do you feel as though your experience as an artist has aided or  complicated your involvement in these issues?
 
David  Banner: Oh, it has definitely aided…because as much as we would  like to think people are interested because of the movement, sometimes  it's because of who we are, and that's fine with me because hopefully I  can put them in a situation or around something that will maybe spark  some level of involvement. In order to feed people, you have to get them  to the table first. And hopefully my being a rapper can help  bring certain people to the table so we can all sit down to eat. If you  really look at it from Sean Bell to Oscar Grant to Trayvon Martin, these  are things that have been happening to people in the United States  since, you know, Africans were brought over here on boats. This is  nothing new. And the sad part is America has the feeling that racism  doesn't exist anymore. In Boston today there were racial slurs coming  from all the Bruins fans. That in itself shows that we have a long way  to go.
 
2. Flyby: What is a celebrity's role or  responsibility—if any—for being a vehicle for social change?
 
DB: Well, what I will say, and what I can only say is what my  responsibility is. And my responsibility is not from an artist's  perspective but from a man's. As a man, it is my responsibility [to  promote social change], because hip hop has given so much to me...but you can't ask every artist to do something because they aren't built  like that. A lot of them don't have the expertise about the situation,  and if they don't feel it in their hearts, I don't feel like they should  speak.
 
3. Flyby: You have said that "hip hop is sick because America is sick." How do we find a cure for this?
 
DB: Well, one of the problems in America is that we don't admit that the  symptoms exist, so we never actually get to the disease. Racism, racial  profiling, and all of the things that go on in our community are things  we think are not true or don't happen, and that's a lie. I think racism  and discrimination are plowing through the underbelly of America. We  won't admit that they exist. First of all, we have to get what it is,  acknowledge it, talk about it, and find steps to make sure that it  doesn't happen again. We need to admit there is a problem.
 
4. Flyby: You  recently launched a new program called 2M1, which you have described as "a grassroots attempt to assert our collective independence by taking  control of our movies, our music and our creative content," and your new  mixtape will drop on May 22. How was this project inspired by  current rap music consumption and the way young adults are relating to  hip hop artists today?
 
DB: The point of 2M1 is first of all to continue [putting out material] and  get a group of [two million] people to donate at least one dollar. And  with that, they are going to get "Sex, Drugs, and Videogames," which is a  new album with Lil' Wayne, Chris Brown, Snoop Dogg, 2 Chainz. imagine  having access to two million people's emails. This is now a think tank  of people that can always come together and say, "Hey, we need to support  each other," if there is something that we need to boycott, if there is  something bad happening in our community, etc. And I think that there  needs to be collaboration between fans and artists. A problem in this  industry is that we have made fans feel like they aren't important, and  they are such an important part of the equation.
 
5. Flyby: Can you name one especially fun memory from production? Was anybody particularly great to work with?
 
DB: It was really cool to shoot the "Californication" video. It's with me,  Snoop, Game, Nipsey Hussle, K.R.I.T. It was just really cool to be with  some of the legends and some of the West Coast greats. And to be able to  say that I had something to do with it is a real cool opportunity. I  loved being able to be around and learn from Snoop. And to navigate  myself through those smoke clouds!
 
6. Flyby: Right now, who would you look up to? Who do you think is a real game-changer in the music industry?
 
DB: As far as hip hop is concerned, I would honestly say me. I think that  with the 2M1 movement and with what I am doing, you know it is really  changing how we approach our fans. We can approach our music and actually distribute our music by taking control of our finances, and I would say that it's me and the 2M1 movement and that's not being an ego-maniac.
 
7. Flyby: How would you define the hip hop generation and is it a static movement or something that is always changing?
 
DB: You know, I always say hip hop is a reflection of what is going on in the mirror. When the  era was more political, the music was more political. Now America is so  commercial, and I think that America cares a lot more about big  businesses and the corporations. I think music contributes to that.  People think more about what the record company thinks than what the  streets think, and I mean that's my own personal opinion, but is  reflected in the music. When America became more commercial and more  about reality TV shows and the race for president became more about  people's personal lives than their political affiliations or their  ability to actually run our country, rap became focused on radio  singing. Yes, we do need a radio singer, but it shouldn't just be about  the commercial aspect of it.
