After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Feb. 18, 2014, at 5:59 a.m.
In advance of their meeting with University President Drew G. Faust Thursday, leaders of the Undergraduate Council on Sunday outlined fundraising models and broke down the ways in which the would spend the additional $250,000 the organization is seeking from the University.
UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos '15, Vice President Sietse K. Goffard '15, and Student Relations Chair Ava Nasrollahzadeh '16 wrote in a press release to The Crimson Sunday that the requested increase, first announced Feb. 2, “stems from the rapid growth of student organizations and club sports.”
All three proposals that Mayopoulos and Goffard will present to Faust involve a term bill increase, they wrote.
The first would raise the student services free by $40 to a total of $115 per academic year, thereby increasing the UC’s annual budget by about $264,000, or more than 50 percent of its current budget of about $500,000.
A second method, which leaders dubbed the “sliding scales of justice” option, would raise the fee to $150, but students on financial aid would only pay a percentage of the total fee equal to the proportion of total tuition bill they pay.
The final option would peg the student activities charge to a percentage of the overall tuition, rather than increasing the fee by a specified amount, allowing for incremental scaled increases with inflation. According to the Council’s statement, that figure would ideally be .37 percent.
Harvard students currently pay $75 per academic year in the form of the student services fee that funds the Council and supports the grants it gives to student groups on campus.
As the number of student organizations has increased by 35 percent in the last 9 academic years, the UC leaders said that that fee, applied to each student’s term bill, has remained fixed.
“We are falling behind,” they wrote in the press release, noting that the average student activities fee at peer institutions is $169.
If they receive permission for the funding increase, the leaders said that the body would distribute 65 percent of the new funds to student groups and club sports. Fifteen percent of the funds would be set aside for House Committees and the Freshman Class Committee.
The remaining 20 percent would fund a broad variety of UC committee initiatives that subsidize events for students. Feedback from student surveys administered as part of Operation Ghost Protocol, the body’s new student outreach effort, would also play a part in the direction of this portion of the funds.
In a separate interview Sunday evening, Mayopoulos said that although he would prefer that additional UC funding come directly from the University, the prospects are historically low.
“We are trying to be as realistic as possible,” Mayopoulos said. “The only way the UC has ever been able to fund student co-curricular activities has been through the term bill.”
To that end, Mayopoulos said that the UC does not expect an immediate financial resolution from Thursday afternoon’s meeting.
“We are aware that we will not walk out of President Faust’s office with a check for a quarter of a million dollars,” Mayopoulos said, though he added, “I don’t think it is symbolic. I think that we genuinely do want to see that President Faust understands how important co-curricular activities are for undergrads and that she supports an increase in funding for those.”
After the meeting with Faust, Mayopoulos said that more talks with other Harvard officials such as Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith will be planned.
Mayopoulos said that the UC hopes it can receive an increase in funding for the next academic year.
Mayopoulos stressed the importance of student input in the process of acquiring the funding. In their press release, UC leaders requested that any student who participates in a campus organization gather near Massachusetts Hall at 4 p.m. Thursday in anticipation of their meeting with Faust. As an incentive, UC leaders said thicker toilet paper will be distributed to those present.
“I don’t think the UC can do this by itself, but the UC shouldn’t do it by itself—it should do it with the students backing it,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
UPDATED: Feb. 18, 2014, at 12:25 a.m.
Born out of the adaptation of the class for online education platform HarvardX, a new policy implemented in Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding 12: “Poetry in America” prevents students from asking questions in lectures and has prompted the course instructor, English professor Elisa New, to foster student-teacher interaction in new ways.
According to New, an English professor who has previously taught the class, the policy arose out of the technological difficulties of integrating student questions into lecture recordings, which will be presented in the virtual form of the class on HarvardX.
“The video team said, ‘No way, man. We’re not going to be able to [record student questions],’” she said.
In experimenting with the new format of question-free lectures, New said she has tried to maintain a high standard of accessibility, adding that the poetry course lent itself well to delaying questions to the conclusion of lecture. During the 90-minute lecture, the first hour is recorded without any student questions, while the last half hour is reserved for student discussion, she said.
“Over 30 years of teaching, sometimes students interrupt with [questions like], ‘what does that word mean?’ or ‘what is pentameter again?’ but it’s never felt like you’re going to miss anything,” New said. “This isn’t math class. It’s not a technical subject.”
In addition to normal office hours, the course includes off-camera discussions, informal activities, and question-and-answer sessions after lectures.
Students said the efforts made to cultivate interaction outside of lectures have sufficiently compensated for the initial frustration of being unable to ask questions.
“At first, it bothered me, but Professor New makes herself really available after class and has a lot of office hours,” said a freshman in the course who was granted anonymity by The Crimson because the student feared that his or her grade would be affected. “She stays around after class for 30 minutes to answer questions and talk. I think this setup may even be preferable.”
Viet D. Tran ’16, another student in the course, said that its experimental lecture format was a new experience for him.
“This is the first class I’ve taken where asking a question isn’t initially allowed,” Tran said. “However, questions in my other lectures are usually reserved for the end of class anyway.”
Still, New said she believes that the ideal classroom is an interactive one.
“I often leave a little lonely when I am not able to talk to students, and I’m very happy when they ask questions afterwards,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a weekend of competing against nationally ranked opponents, the Harvard track and field team returned to Ivy League competition Saturday as it faced Yale and Princeton in the annual HYP meet in New Haven.
“It’s a historic rivalry, so it’s always a good meet,” co-captain Maks Korolev said.
The women swept the meet, finishing with 69 points compared to the Tigers’ 48.5 and the Bulldogs’ 41.5. The Crimson won nine of 15 events on the day to clinch the victory. The win over Princeton is the first time the women have beaten their Ivy opponent since the 2008-2009 season.
“For our women to win for the first time in five years against Princeton is a great display of our depth, and really shows where we’re at with the program,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said.
Junior sprinter Danielle Barbian continued her strong 2013-2014 campaign, leading the pack in the 60-meter dash with a time of 7.50 seconds. Though she was just a tad slower than the school record time of 7.48 she ran last week, the sprinter set a new HYP meet record on Saturday. She had set the previous meet record of 7.59 last season when the three Ancient Eight foes met.
Freshman Nikki Okwelogu continued to shine in the shot put event. Okwelogu was the clear front-runner, as she threw .68 meters further than the runner up, teammate Adabelle Ekechukwu. The rookie’s distance of 15.02 meters was a personal best and the second-best throw in school history.
One of the most contested events of the day came in the women’s 4x400 meter relay. The Harvard ‘A’ relay team of freshman Haley Baker, senior Olivia Abbate, sophomore Christi Scott, and sophomore Madison Hansen beat out the Princeton ‘A’ relay team by only a hundredth of a second. The Crimson took the event with a time of 3 minutes, 52.96 seconds. The race was close the entire time, but Hansen, who ran the last leg, pushed to keep Harvard ahead.
In several events, Crimson runners’ top competition came from their own teammates. The women swept the top three spots in the 60-meter dash while also taking the top two spots in the 200-meter dash, the 60-meter hurdles, the high jump, and the shot put.
It was a split decision for the Harvard men, as Princeton held a commanding lead throughout the meet. The final scores had the Tigers on top with 89 points, the Crimson in the second position with 54, and Yale bringing up the rear with 26.
The main competition was between Harvard and the Tigers, as the Bulldogs were only able to capture one first place finish. Yale’s Marc-Andre Alexandre won the men’s 400-meter dash, setting a meet record with a time of 48.01 seconds.
Overall, the Crimson took five events compared to Princeton’s nine victories. The Tigers dominated the sprinting contests, while Korolev and senior James Leakos helped the Crimson in the middle and long distances.
“We had some outstanding individual performances and again showed some key strengths,” Saretsky said. “[There’s] a lot of excitement and momentum for the Ivy Championships.”
Korolev continued to excel as he captured victory in the 1-mile event, setting the meet record with a time of 4 minutes, 2.24 seconds. Leakos was first to cross the line in the 3000-meter run with a time of 8 minutes, 8.98 seconds.
“I had a pacer through the first 800,” Korolev said. “Then I just went. I knew I wanted the win.”
The Crimson struggled in the relays Saturday, as it came in third in both the 4x400 meter and 4x800 meter relays, with the Tigers earning first place points in both events and Yale seizing back-to-back second place finishes.
In the field, Harvard dominated the weight throw as it swept the top three spots. Junior Ben Glauser won the event with a distance of 19.33 meters while freshman Josh Whitener and senior Dustin Brode took second and third, respectively.
The meet brought the indoor regular season to a close, as the Crimson will compete next March 1st at Dartmouth for the Ivy League Championships. Some runners will continue to compete in the week off in order to stay fresh for the meet, while others will use the week to focus on training rather than the stress of racing.
“[The HYP meet] is a chance for us to focus on head to head competition,” Saretsky said. “It’s a perfect stepping stone as we get ready for the Ivy Championships in two weeks.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A career night for senior guard Jasmine Evans carried the Harvard women’s basketball team to an 84-69 victory over Cornell. Evans scored 21 points, a personal record, to help secure the Crimson’s win at Lavietes Pavilion.  Harvard’s victory over the Big Red makes it a three-team race for the conference title down the stretch as Princeton, Penn, and the Crimson all sit with only one Ivy League loss to date.
Harvard (17-5, 7-1 Ivy) was able to jump out to an early lead thanks in large part to junior Temi Fagbenle, who came out of the gates red-hot. The 6’4” forward went 4-for-5 from the field in the first 10 minutes of the game and imposed her will against a talented Cornell (12-10, 4-4) frontline of Allyson DiMagno and Nia Marshall.
Fagbenle’s strong start forced the Big Red guards to sag slightly towards the junior when defending the pick-and-roll. The adjustment, while successful in slowing Fagbenle’s inside presence, allowed the Crimson guards to find success on the perimeter.
“They were hedging on our ball screens, so our focus was to get a lot of inside-outside action,” Evans said. “With so much focus on our forwards, it opens up our guards for easy shots. I think we do a great job of seeing the floor, seeing each other, and finding the open player.”
Midway through the first half with Harvard up, 17-11, coach Kathy Delaney-Smith switched to a zone look on defense.  The Crimson stayed in the zone for roughly five minutes and was able to force two turnovers while extending its lead to 25-15.
Four straight points from Cornell’s senior leader DiMagno helped cut Harvard’s lead to five with only a couple minutes to go before half, but two strong plays from Evans and sophomore Kit Metoyer pushed the Crimson lead back to 10 as the teams headed into the locker rooms for halftime.
With a minute left, Evans swiped the ball from Big Red freshman Megan Ludic and took it coast-to-coast for a crafty transition lay-in.  On Harvard’s next possession, the Crimson had its inside-outside game on display as Fagbenle kicked the ball out to the sharpshooter Metoyer who pulled up well behind the arc to knock down a deep three as time expired.
Co-captain Christine Clark, coming off a 21-point performance against Columbia that saw her go 7-of-11 from the field, struggled through much of the first half as the Cornell defense continuously tried to force the ball out of her hand.  The senior ended the first half with 8 points on just 4-of-11 shooting.
Despite a difficult first half, Clark would finish the game with 20 points behind a strong second half that saw her get to the free-throw line eight times. The biggest story of the second half, however, was Evans taking over down the stretch.
The senior guard scored 15 of her 21 points in the second half and was one of only a few Harvard players that remained poised against a three-quarter-court press by Cornell that continuously bothered the Crimson offense down the stretch.
Quick buckets from Clark, Fagbenle, and senior Melissa Mullins pushed the Crimson lead to 20 early in the second half, but the lead would not last against the backcourt pressure from the Big Red.
Twelve Harvard turnovers in the second half, many while trying to get the ball over the half-court line, allowed Cornell back into the game. As the Big Red slowly tried to chip away at the Harvard lead, it was Evans that came up with big play after big play.
With the lead down to 15 with eight minutes left in the game, Evans sank a pull-up jumper off an assist from Mullins. After a Cornell turnover on the other end, junior guard Ali Curtis pushed the ball up the floor and found Evans in the corner for a transition three to give the Crimson a 64-44 edge.
After two quick Big Red scores, Evans found Fagbenle inside with an assist. Evans then generated another steal and pushed the ball up the floor, driving right at two Cornell players to earn a trip to the line. The two free throws made it nine-straight points for the senior guard.
Though the Big Red eventually cut the Crimson lead to 11, it was too little, too late for the visitors from Ithaca as Harvard hit its free throws to close the game out.
“I think Jasmine created a lot [for us tonight] by being really smart and being under control while pulling up off the dribble or driving off of a steal,” Delaney-Smith said. “I though Jasmine was a superstar tonight; she was a poised, talented senior.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 6/6 Harvard women’s hockey team needed a stop.
Early in the third period Saturday, the Crimson had watched a 2-0 lead over St. Lawrence disappear in less than 30 seconds. Now with less than six minutes to play, Harvard held a one-goal advantage, but the Saints threatened to tie the contest with a penalty shot after an interference call.
Harvard had lost third-period leads in crucial games before this season, and this was another big matchup. The Crimson had just surrendered its grip on first place in the ECAC with a 2-1 loss to No. 5/5 Clarkson Friday. Another defeat would have meant carrying the team’s first losing streak of the season into the schedule’s final weekend.
More than that, it would have meant a defeat in seniors Elizabeth Parker and Gina McDonald’s final regular season game at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center.
So as Saints forward Kayla Raniwsky wove towards the Crimson net, sophomore goalie Emerance Maschmeyer needed to make a stop. After Raniwsky deked right and then left, Maschmeyer did just that, stopping the puck with her stick before emphatically slapping it to the side boards for good measure.
“Obviously a lot of energy was going through me,” Maschmeyer said of her reaction. “I was super excited–it was a huge save for the team. You could just tell on the bench the team was pumped up about it, so I was excited too.”
Though Maschmeyer had not faced a penalty shot this year, Crimson interim head coach Maura Crowell expected nothing less than a save.
“Once they got the penalty shot, we felt pretty confident in Emerance,” she said. “We run a breakaway drill every day in practice, so we know what she is capable of. That obviously boosted the team and helped us win.”
It was only fitting that McDonald later put the game away with an empty-netter to give Harvard a 5-2 victory.
“That was unbelievable,” Crowell said. “It was not planned that way, but when Gina intercepted that pass and put it away, that was great.”
This year’s senior class was supposed to be bigger, but Kalley Armstrong and junior captain Marissa Gedman had to miss a year each with injury, and Lyndsey Fry got the call to play for Team USA in Sochi.
But for this year’s team, the two seniors have been enough, and Maschmeyer wanted to send them out right. Last year, the goalie was relieved a period into what would be a 3-1 senior day loss to Clarkson.
“Last year, senior day didn’t go so well, so this year it was great to have a great day for our seniors,” Maschmeyer said.  “It was a night they will remember for the rest of their lives.”
Junior Samantha Reber made the win possible with a power-play strike from the slot five minutes into the third, putting Harvard (20-4-3, 15-3-2 ECAC) up, 3-2. Previously, SLU (11-17-3, 10-7-3) had scored 1:30 into the third period and then again 28 seconds later to turn a 2-0 deficit into a tie game.
Before that Saints outburst, it looked like two early Crimson goals might stand up. Junior Sarah Edney got the scoring started with a power-play tally 12 minutes into the game, and two minutes later, classmate Hillary Crowe put Harvard up two. Crowe is now second on the team in goals, two behind sophomore Miye D’Oench.
But St. Lawrence made a game of it, and Maschmeyer was called upon in yet another late-game scenario. Stopping 47 of 49 shots, she now sits second in the country with a .950 save percentage, first among goalies who have played 12 or more games.
Sophomore Mary Parker, Elizabeth's sister, scored an empty-netter before McDonald's clincher. Saturday was the second time this season the Crimson has had five different skaters score a goal in a game.
With the win, Harvard reached the 20-win plateau for a third straight season and remained undefeated (16-0-2) when scoring first. The Crimson also stayed in a tie with Clarkson for second-place in the ECAC, one point behind Cornell. If those three teams win out next weekend, Harvard would host a quarterfinal matchup in the ECAC tournament before potentially traveling for the semifinals and finals.
“The third period was not the way we wanted it to go,” Crowell said. “But I’m happy we came up with the big goals when we needed them, and the saves.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Looking solidify its presence at the top of the ECAC, the No. 6/6 Harvard women’s ice hockey team took a step down to second in the league at the hand of No. 5/5 Clarkson.
In the final weekend of regular-season home play, the Crimson (20-4-3, 15-3-2 ECAC) stumbled against the top offense in the nation to drop Friday’s contest, 2-1, against the Golden Knights (23-4-5, 14-2-4) at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center.
Tied at 1-1 with just five minutes left in the third period, it was evident that a game involving two top-10 teams would be less a flashy battle of trick shots and more of a gritty contest that continuously went back-and-forth across the ice.
Finally, Clarkson defender Erin Ambrose, who leads in the nation in assists with 24 to the season, caught a crucial break from teammate Shannon MacAulay. Ambrose received MacAulay’s pass from the goal line up at the blueline and slapped the long-range shot into the net past Harvard sophomore goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer.
“In the second [Clarkson] possessed most of the puck in our D-zone, but I think we did a really good job of keeping things to the outside,” said interim Crimson head coach Maura Crowell. “Shots on net—you can analyze that all you want—but it was a 1-1 game until five minutes left.”
As the clock ticked down, the Crimson couldn’t convert on looks and had trouble obtaining possessions in order to pull Maschmeyer for the man-advantage. The goalie finished with 37 saves as the Golden Knights sent puck after puck her way. The leader in goals and points in the county, Clarkson forward Jamie Lee Rattray notched a game-high eight shots, while Ambrose trailed with seven of her own.
Ambrose wasn’t the only Clarkson skater to get past Maschmeyer, as MacAulay added her own tally 5:14 into the first period. Forward Christine Lambert found an open lane to her teammate and dashed off the biscuit to MacAuley who, waiting in front of the crease, connected with the back of the net.
Crease action was crucial for Harvard too. Sophomore Mary Parker took an assist from captain Marissa Gedman to overwhelm Clarkson goaltender Erica Howe and score a tying goal for the Crimson, 1-1, as Harvard junior Hillary Crowe and senior Gina McDonald crashed into the net.
“I think the timing of it was great...in a period where there was back and forth action,” Crowell said. “Mary got a nice shot off-angle on Erica and she kind of bobbled it…. Tons of pressure in the crease always causes good things for us.”
The goal was Parker’s fifth in six games and came just as the first frame was about to expire with 2.4 seconds left on the clock.
“I think things have been starting to click,” said Parker of her recent scores. “I’ve been working hard and trying to do little things all over the ice.”
Despite a number of good looks from a flurry of Crimson players during the second and third periods, not another Harvard goal would materialize. Instead, Crowell and her squad were forced to take the L, and to perch at the end of the regular season looking to win out for the league title.
“Every game’s huge,” Crowell said. “It has been for a long time, and we have to put this one behind us rather quickly.”

Whether you're strolling through the Yard or spending some quality time outside of your favorite final club, you’ve no doubt overheard some interesting conversations on campus. You’ve heard students complain about how busy they are, and lament about how attractive but unavailable their TF is. Sometimes you hear something so ridiculous that you wish someone else was there and you really want to tell your friends before you forget, but then they’re too busy in an Orgo lab. Well don't worry, because we've got you covered with a few gems recently overheard on campus.On the way to the science center, two girls walking behind me are talking:“I hope I can get thesis funding for the summer so that I can go to Cape Cod for two weeks.”Analysis: One of the nice things about Harvard is that there is funding to do almost any type of research. This particular Junior has an especially creative interpretation of what ‘research’ means. What’s her thesis topic, the architecture of sandcastles?Enjoying a coffee at Gato Rojo, three grad students next to me are talking:“When I get a few drinks in me I think slapping guys is one of the most fun things to do.”Analysis: The rest of the conversation didn’t clear this up in any way. I have no idea.Walking in front of Widener library, two guys next to me are talking:“Dude, maybe you should just split with your friends into another blocking group and then we can link.”Analysis: These two young freshman are experiencing blocking drama in their friend group, with one ‘dude’ trying too hard to bring in some outside buddies. In exasperation, the other friend has decided its not going to work out. Don’t worry though, the consolation prize of linkage is like really meaningful and they’ll totally stay friends.Doing some work in Lamont Cafe, and again some grad students are talking next to me:“I have a friend who goes to Georgia State and when she graduates she's going to have twice as many classes as me!”Analysis: Although you might be a worried and stressed out grad student, have no fear. Despite your degree in the history of Tibetan rug weaving, you still have just as bright a future as your good friend at Georgia.Walking through the yard and a blond eight year-old with earbuds in says to his older brother:“Creedence Clearwater Revival. Do you even know who that is?!”Analysis: This young and precocious 3rd grader has discovered an excellent and underrated folk rock band. If he can turn down the sass and speak more respectfully to his elders, he might one day write for The Crimson's art section.12:15 a.m. Thursday night, some guy walking down Mass Ave in front of my window singing:“This could be the end of everything, so why don't we go somewhere only we know.”Analysis: Quoting lyrics from popular (in 2004) song Somewhere Only We Know by Keane, this gentleman is either experiencing heartbreak or coming back after a few too many drinks from karaoke night. Probably both. Sorry buddy.
