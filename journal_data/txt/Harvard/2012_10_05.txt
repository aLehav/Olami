After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past May, Harvard University became the target of a wrongful death suit for the 2009 shooting of Justin D. C. D. Cosby, a Cambridge resident, in the basement of Kirkland House. The person eventually accused of the shooting, Jabrai Jordan Copney, had been living in Lowell House with his girlfriend, Brittany J. Smith, for most of the year before the shooting, despite Harvard’s prohibition against non-Harvard affiliated persons living in the dormitories. Harvard’s negligence in enforcing its own policy became the grounds upon which Cosby’s mother brought the suit, stating that there was a chance that her son’s death could have been prevented had the resident dean of Lowell and the two Lowell House Masters—all defendants in her suit—been more attentive.
Harvard recently filed a motion to have the suit dropped, claiming that there was not sufficient grounds to support it. In a memorandum, the University listed many reasons that Harvard should not be held accountable, with the underlying sentiment being that Harvard cannot be held legally responsible for the fates and for the actions of non-Harvard affiliates.
Though Lowell House administrators did show a marked neglect of Harvard’s policies in overlooking Copney’s presence in the House, Harvard cannot be held responsible for a crime upon which it had no proximate influence. It is true that Copney violated a Harvard rule by living in Lowell House and that the crime was largely a result of Cosby’s relationship with members of the Harvard community, but there is nothing to suggest that Cosby would not have been shot had Copney been staying elsewhere. Copney was sufficiently enmeshed in the Harvard community that had he been living somewhere in Greater Boston, chances are that he would still have spent a good deal of time on Harvard’s campus, would still have had swipe access to the dorms due to his relationship, and this crime still could have taken place. Though Harvard’s negligence in enforcing its dormitory policy did indeed facilitate the crime, it cannot be said to have contributed to the crime in a very meaningful way.
Furthermore, we cannot expect Harvard to be able to regulate everything that happens on campus. We are an urban campus that is not physically isolated from the larger community, and as such the administration has a lack of control over the campus that would not be true were the campus more contained and located further from a city center.
Of course Cosby’s death was tragic, and his mother has every reason for wanting to see justice achieved for her son. However, the three men charged for Cosby’s murder are already behind bars, and there is no reason to bring a lawsuit against a second party. As a result, ultimately the only sensible course of action that the judge can take is dismissal of the suit.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I once loved an insectivore. Not long after her adoption, Hedgie, as we called our family hedgehog, learned to relax her spines, unclench from her defensive ball, and share her love as well as any cat or dog. But in spite of how well we came to know her, nothing astounded my younger brother and me more than Hedgie’s feeding ritual. Every night after work, my father would scoop our furry friend out of her cage, open the PetSmart-brand tub, and call us over as Hedgie snapped up crickets or mealworms with animal relish.
Although we lost Hedgie in 2005, it would take me until January 2012 to understand truly what she was made of. Amidst the bustle of a night market off Beijing’s trendy Wangfujing Street, I made final communion with my late pet hedgehog: for about $3, I polished off two chili-sprinkled grasshoppers and four baby scorpions. I became an insectivore.
It was a long time in the making. Aside from Hedgie’s daily example, I grew up admiring “Strange Foods,” an artful coffee table book by Jerry Hopkins with features on the many ways to eat “grasshoppers,” “ants and termites,” “spiders and scorpions,” “beetles,” “crickets and cicadas,” “butterflies and moths,” and “flies.” Even then, I was struck by the moral clarity of Hopkins’ assertion: “while it is true that in some cases in undeveloped or still-emerging countries, people eat insects out of necessity, generally speaking it is the abundance, accessibility, nutritional value, and taste that makes insects popular as food, and not the threat of starvation.” In other words, it makes sense to eat bugs.
Compared to the world’s present-day animal agriculture industry, an entomophagous society would be both more efficient and ecologically sounder. High in protein and low in fat, insects could both save the poor from the brink of starvation and save the rich from diseases engendered by a high-fat diet. And for what it’s worth, not only can eating insects be efficient, nutritious, and delectable, but more profoundly, it can also be an impetus toward open-mindedness in a world stultified by routine.
It doesn’t take much more than a screening of Food, Inc. to know that the livestock-based meat industry is coursing quickly toward unsustainability. All the tenets of this standard vegetarian trope are essentially true: the livestock industry contributes handily to global warming, its appetite for pasture has felled millions of acres of forest, and its animals consume a majority of grain grown on the planet.
Fortunately, insects represent an efficient, environmentally sound alternative that can sate our naturally animal-craving palates. Requiring little space, insects take in a trivial amount of water compared to traditional livestock—while at the same time reproducing far more quickly and converting food into body mass far more efficiently. Moreover, an insect-based food economy would not only correct for the gross distortions that make starvation a daily prospect for many Third World peasants, but it would also restore plentiful, high-protein, mineral-rich locusts, beetles, and ants to the diets of peoples addicted into malnourishment by packaged Western foods. And among populations where obesity has outstripped starvation as a threat to public health, the low-fat, hormone-free character of insect meat would do much to overturn the excesses of a half-century of cow and pig consumption gone awry.
Lest you take your writer for a masochist, I promise that I would not be making this case if insects tasted bad. On the contrary, insects, like other animals, can prove delicious if done right—not an altogether difficult task, considering that entomophagous chefs need not deal with the blood, gristle, and leathery skin that typifies the business of cooking conventional meat. Not to speak of my no-frills skillet-to-skewer experience in Beijing, “Strange Foods” offers recipes for grasshopper spring rolls, scorpion and asparagus canapés, cricket tempura, and ant egg tamales.
Finally, the case for eating insects is a case for rebellion against arbitrary standards of disgust: a case for open-mindedness. Despite the illusion of unprecedented choice in our customization-happy age, most people in the developed world make very few interesting choices on a daily basis. And although it once made sense to be disgusted by bugs—absent quality control, our ancestors often had no way to trust that they were free of toxins—it now makes more sense to be disgusted by beef, pork, and chicken, shot up with hormones and torn apart on slaughterhouse floors. Not only will you be fitter for having chosen entomophagy, but you’ll also be a braver, more adventurous person for having resisted the evolutionary and social impulses to shun creepy crawlers.
So trendsetters, drop your bacon cupcakes: join me, my pet hedgehog, and the eager bug sellers of Donghuamen Night Market and crunch into something winged and sextipedal. The earth, your waistline, and your palate will thank you.

It is often said that politics is the oldest profession after prostitution. I simply put before you, dear reader, why the former prohibits the latter.
If a beautiful lady sells magazine subscriptions better than an ugly man, is she a prostitute? If a painter sells a painting of a naked woman, is he a pimp? Is a modeling agency guilty of sex trafficking? Should women who choose a date for materialistic reasons be put in jail? Surely, you’ll answer no. However, all these examples represent either the economic benefit of sexual advantage or the sexual benefit of economic advantage.
Of course, you’re not convinced. Sexual intercourse is different than mere sexual attraction. Yet consider this: an adult male approaches an adult female and offers to pay her for sex, she consents, and the transaction is completed. Is that prostitution? Most would readily say yes. But, wait, there’s more! Imagine if, in this hypothetical, a camera caught the whole exchange of fluids and finances on tape. Now it is simply pornography! Legal as a Puritan puppy on the Fourth of July!
In short, virtual voyeurism turns prostitution into pornography and punishment into profit. Most people do not favor prohibiting pornography but favor prohibiting prostitution. I find these two beliefs incompatible. The law essentially allows prostitution if the “John” is not paying the prostitute for his own sexual gratification but rather for economic profit in selling the sexual encounter to others. So how do you draw the line when sex is being sold to consumers on a daily basis and when paid sexual intercourse is legal so long as it is caught on tape?
Well, in short, you can’t draw that line. The best the law has come up with is essentially the discretion of the court. As former Supreme Court Justice, Potter Stewart, so adroitly put it when trying to define obscenity, “I know it when I see it.”
Some advocate decriminalizing prostitution on the grounds that it is a “victimless crime.” However, under most laws it is legally considered a “public order crime,” or a crime that disrupts the order of a community. In fact, it used to be considered a type of vagrancy. Street prostitution is illegal across the United States and only a couple counties in Nevada allow institutionalized or “brothel prostitution.” But prostitution, along with soliciting and facilitating prostitution, is illegal.
Oddly enough, laws prohibiting prostitution are fairly recent phenomena. Before the turn of the century, not only was prostitution legal, but there were also laws regulating it. Laws prohibiting prostitution are a product of the Progressive Era of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Prostitution laws largely came from a concern for the spread of venereal disease. There is, perhaps, no worse a way to stem the spread of venereal disease than by forcing those who have sexually transmitted diseases out of the public eye and encouraging its secrecy. Now, assured access to healthy prostitutes is nearly impossible, and prostitutes have less of an incentive to seek treatment (lest they be found out).
Some argue that prostitution isn’t a choice and that most women turn to prostitution out of desperation. I think this argument comes from the right place. It is important to note that the typical hooker is a far cry from the sympathetic Julia Roberts-type TV trope some may have in mind. For most gals, whoredom is probably not a first pick of profession. However, I do not think all prostitutes had no other option, and even if prostitution isn’t a choice, what good would outlawing it do? If they never had a choice to begin with, why would its legality matter?
I, like most people in this country, think sex for economic profit is immoral. But I, unlike many in this country , believe prostitution should be decriminalized. The law does not necessarily speak to morality. What is immoral is not always illegal, and what is illegal is not always immoral. For example, U.S. law does not prohibit cheating on your wife with her sister, giving an old lady the finger, denying the Holocaust, telling children in the street that Santa Claus isn’t real, or just generally being a jerk. If you need any proof, simply take a look at the moral caliber of the people in charge of passing laws.

The movie theater has always been a magical place. When the lights go down, the audience is treated to a two-hour vicarious journey through the eyes of a hero. A Sunday afternoon can turn into a shootout with outlaws, an alien invasion, drunken debauchery in Las Vegas, or a love affair with a ripped A-lister.
But recently, Hollywood has been defiled by another industry. Now, studios have transformed from merely the financial catalysts for works of art to massive firms operating with dreams of immense profits. Business has taken over the film industry and with this seizure, creativity and originality have been replaced with profitability and practicality.
In the “Golden Age of Film” classics like Citizen Kane and Casablanca pulled in moviegoers even as they broke new ground. Now the industry is bent on mass producing the cookie-cutter tales of spandex-clad superheroes.
Now, studio executives, many of them more versed in business than film, are more concerned with minimizing risk in production. This means that studios look toward previous successes as a means to achieve profits in the future, and so they favor sequel after sequel. This ideology gives rise to the Men in Blacks III’s of the world, the resurrection of Spiderman after a brief respite, and even a rehashing of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Total Recall.
Comparing the top grossing films in 1981 with 2011, the juxtaposition is glaringly apparent. The year 1981 saw the birth of Indiana Jones in Raiders of the Lost Ark and has seven original screenplays among the top 10 highest grossing of the year, including Chariots of Fire. The year 2011 saw nearly 10 billion dollars in revenue among its top 10 films and included absolutely no originals.
As rational individuals, studio executives are searching for means to maximize their respective studio’s profits. The trends point to the fact that moviegoers are drawn to the theater by familiarity. With the increase in ticket prices and ubiquitous availability of films via Netflix and Blockbuster, moviegoers are only willing to part with the $8.12 that constitutes the average price of a movie ticket, if they are familiar with the subject matter.
With the production of these sequels, the art of film is completely taken out of the equation. Studios are well aware that these hefty-budgeted, mainstream movies will reap lucrative returns regardless of how artfully the film is crafted. Production is sped up to bring about a hasty release. Elaborate effects are added. And during this blockbuster’s tenure in theaters, hundreds of millions of dollars are generated.
So while the sequel becomes more and more profitable, original ideas serve, in the eyes of studios, as tremendous risks. Why produce a script of a completely unorthodox nature when the studio can just pay a writer to craft a new version of Jurassic Park and make hundreds of millions of dollars in the process?
As an aspiring screenwriter myself, this sudden loss of art and creativity in film is particularly alarming. It makes breaking into the industry all the more difficult.
When I had my first meeting with an agent at William Morris Endeavor, a talent agency, as a sweating, nervous wreck of a teenager, I could not comprehend how entrenched this new “marketability” mindset has dug itself into the film industry. Being told directly that any spec script, the industry term for original screenplay, is nearly impossible to sell seems counter-intuitive for an industry bent on the creativity of storytellers.
The market for originality in Hollywood seems to have been relegated to the independent spectrum. The disparity between the major studios and these smaller productions has only been exacerbated in recent years. The fact of the matter is that these smaller pictures would actually benefit profusely from a larger budget, particularly with regard to acting talent and distribution. An independent picture, no matter how original it may be, goes through the film festival circuit without hardly ever branching out to national audiences.
And the sad part is, most of these films mirror the original artistic aspects that were native to the early film industry: an original script, an intricate array of shots and a human story without exemplary and extraordinary effects. These movies focus on aesthetics and attempts to salvage an industry plagued by a business mindset.
Now finding the next blockbuster entails making a stop at the comic book store and picking up the latest edition of a Marvel Comic or reproducing a movie made 30 years ago. No longer are the creative worlds of screenwriters coming alive in elaborate productions.
The harsh reality is unavoidable, but there are many aspiring screenwriters and actors hungry for original projects. Hollywood may not be the imaginative think tank it once was, but that doesn’t mean that it couldn’t be that again.

Chief Justice John G. Roberts ’76 cast a strategic vote in June’s Obamacare decision, Jeffrey R. Toobin ’82 said Thursday, in an effort to shield the Supreme Court from the partisanship that rules Washington politics.
“Chief Justice Roberts did not want the Court to be seen as just another place where party battles were held,” he said as part of the Robert C. Cobb, Sr. Memorial Lecture held in Sanders Theatre.
Toobin, a staff writer for The New Yorker and the senior legal analyst for CNN, is widely regarded as one of the country’s foremost Supreme Court experts.
The Court’s four liberal and five conservative Justices, he said, are key to understanding how it works.
“If you remember one thing from my talk, that’s it. This court is driven by precisely the same party divisions that Congress is,” Toobin, a former editorial chair of The Crimson, said.
At various points in history, different ratios of liberal to conservative Justices governed the Court’s rulings, he said.
Toobin’s latest book, “The Oath: The Obama White House and the Supreme Court,” centers on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act case. Roberts, a conservative appointed by President George W. Bush in 2005, was one of five votes that ruled the health-care law constitutional.
Describing the ruling in June as “the great drama of last spring,” he noted that the reason for Roberts’ vote was the question that “everyone wants to answer.”
According to Toobin, Roberts “views himself as the custodian” of public opinion on the Supreme Court.
Yet, this instance of crossing the party line does not rebrand Roberts as a liberal, Toobin said.
“I assure you that as we go forward in this term and more terms to come, John Roberts will be the conservative that President Bush wanted him to be,” he said. “It just so happens that in the Obamacare case Roberts voted with the Democrats. Don’t count on that happening very often.”
Following his lecture, Toobin answered questions from the audience on topics such as the two same-sex marriage cases that could go before the Supreme Court before the end of the year, and the relationship between the President and the Court.
Francesca Coltrera, an Arlington resident, heard about the event from a friend who works in the music department. Toobin was “irreverent but he knows his stuff,” she said.
Elizabeth W. Vorenberg, the former co-master of Dunster House, called Toobin’s speech “very clear and easy to follow.”
In an interview, Toobin said Roberts’ vote would not have a large effect on the coming election.
“The Court’s decision in Obamacare removed the Court as a major issue. Obama cannot complain about the Court that saved his bacon,” he said. “The Supreme Court may not be a top of the line issue for many voters, but when you look at a president’s legacy, few issues loom larger than Supreme Court appointees.”

Several retired Boston athletes became the latest group to endorse U.S. Senator Scott Brown in his reelection campaign for Massachusetts’ junior Senate seat in a new television advertisement released Wednesday. Calling Brown a team player in Washington, the former Celtics and Patriots stars argued Brown deserves another term.
“It seems to me, what we need are independent thinkers who will vote their consciousness, not their party,” former NBA Most Valuable Player Bob Cousy said in the advertisement. “That’s why on my 84th birthday, I am very pleased to endorse the return to Washington of Senator Scott Brown. He’s my most valuable player.”
Boston political consultants said the ad fits into a broader narrative that has emerged from Brown’s campaign. Running in a state as deeply blue as Massachusetts, the Republican senator has had to fashion himself as an independent common man to woo politically independent male voters and socially conservative Democrats, consultants said.
“This is a case where given the voter registration dominance by Democrats in Massachusetts, it’s hard to run an issues-oriented or an ideological campaign, so he’s trying to win with a personality campaign,” said Joseph D. Malone ’78, a Republican political strategist and former Massachusetts Congressional candidate.
The strategy worked for Brown during the special election he won in 2010, said former Boston City Councillor Lawrence S. DiCara ’71. During that campaign Brown caught the attention of dissatisfied Democratic voters with his easygoing persona, political independence, and pickup truck. Unlike then-opponent Mass. Attorney General Martha M. Coakley, who seemed stiff and out of touch, Brown promised likability and political independence.
After two years in Congress in which he built up a bipartisan reputation, DiCara said Brown is putting the strategy to work again, though the circumstances are different. Presidential election years historically drive up voter turnout, which in Massachusetts means more Democratic votes.
“My guess is he needs those voters who have been, through the years, known as Reagan Democrats—people who might vote their party in the presidential election, thus giving Obama a landslide victory in Massachusetts,” Malone said. “But at the same time saying he seems like the boy next door, like the guy I could have a beer with. The guy I can trust.”
Those Reagan Democrats, experts said, are often white, socially conservative males. With Brown’s Democratic opponent, Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren, polling well among women, the stakes are high.
“Some of the more macho ads with sports figures and trucks are the way to get the so-called Reagan Democrats,” DiCara said. “It is a swing demographic—middle American people, mostly white, mostly Catholic, who will vote either way and have no great loyalty to either party.”
Brown, who played basketball in school, has previously run advertisements showing him on the basketball court or in athletic attire.
Democratic political consultant Dan Payne said Brown’s “jock” reputation has all but secured the vote of that constituency.
“He’s probably got them. I don’t think he has to go find them. What he may want to do is just remind them that he is the guy who they supported two years ago in the special election,” Payne said.

Most of us who scribble offhand thoughts on the backs of envelopes expect those scraps to end up in a trashcan, not a library display.
But most of us aren’t Emily Dickinson.
The famed 19th century poet had a penchant for writing verses on envelopes—not just tidbits but elaborate creations that artfully turned the papers from mere letter-carriers to bearers of literature themselves. That literature was the subject of a presentation and exhibit at Houghton Library on Thursday evening.
Artist Jen Bervin and scholar Marta Werner gave a talk on the portfolio of prints they recently created of Dickinson’s envelope poetry. The two produced 60 limited-edition artist books with copies of their full-color and full-scale prints of Dickinson’s original manuscripts. The books, which include a guide and an essay by Werner, are sold by Granary Books for $3,500, but the audience at Houghton had the chance to handle the prints for free.
Woodberry Poetry Room curator Christina Davis, who organized the event, spoke to the significance of Bervin and Werner’s work.
“[Their portfolio] is going to be a seminal moment in Dickinson scholarship,” Davis said. “It is going to open up the possibilities for how to confront Dickinson’s work.”
Bervin talked about the visual nature of the manuscripts.
“A poet as visual as Dickinson has a lot of resonance with the way I think about the page visually,” said Bervin, who not only is a visual artist but also holds a master’s degree in poetry. She described her own work on her project with Werner, which is titled “The Gorgeous Nothings,” as a visual representation of Dickinson’s.
“It’s an opportunity to both read and see her manuscripts in the same space,” Bervin said. “And that’s important with her because her manuscripts are so strongly visual.”
Leslie A. Morris, curator of modern books and manuscripts at Houghton Library, said she appreciated the visual take on Dickinson in “The Gorgeous Nothings.”
“It’s always interesting to see a creative artist take something and turn it into something different,” Morris said. “That’s what poets do, really; they take ordinary words, and they turn it into something different. Jen has taken these different physical objects and makes you look at them in a different way, so it’s much of what a poet does, just in a different medium.”
Katherine Paras, an administrative director at Harvard Law School, said she was struck by the beauty of Dickinson’s envelopes more than a century after their creation.
“It was exquisite and really moving—the love of the art and being able to bridge the time between the creation of the art and the study of it,” Paras said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four faculty members who themselves were first-generation college students gathered in Boylston Hall Thursday to offer advice to current Harvard students. The event, sponsored by the Freshman Dean’s Office, covered topics including adjusting to freshman year and the stigma that first-generation college students face.
Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds introduced the panelists and the moderator, Anya Bernstein Bassett, the social studies director of undergraduate studies.
“This may be the first of many conversations we can have about this,” Hammonds said.
Tommie Shelby, a professor of philosophy and African and African American studies, said that “getting into college was a pretty big shock.”
“There was a language that I did not speak and they all spoke,” said Alexandra Shields, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School. “There were these little cultural references that everyone seemed to know and I had no idea what they were saying.”
Sue Brown, the resident dean of Elm Yard, echoed her colleagues’ sense of alienation.
“I was missing the map that a lot of my classmates had,” she said.
The panelists also offered advice to first-generation students.
“Put yourself out there,” said Matthew K. Nock, a psychology professor.
Shields encouraged students to look for role models.
“Extend yourself,” she said, mentioning that a close relationship with a professor “made a huge difference” for her.
Shields also addressed the stigma against first-generation students.
“There’s a kind of hidden assumption that maybe you’re not as smart,” she said.
Nock advised that “the best way to fight it is to just do the best you can.”
“It’s a stigma because we buy into the stigma,” said Brown. “I’m proud of the fact that I was the first [to attend college].”
Kevin B. Jennings ’85, the founder of the shared interest group First Generation Harvard Alumni and a former assistant deputy secretary of education for the Obama administration, said the small attendance at the event surprised him.
“I was a little disappointed more students didn’t come,” he said.
Despite this, Jennings added that “these kinds of things wouldn’t happen 30 years ago.”
Khadijah Williams ’13 said that the event gave her a “sense of pride” at having such visible role models.
“Being a first-generation student kind of colors your experience at a place like Harvard,” she said.

In an election marked by a close vote, a run-off, and a campaign finance controversy—many tropes Kennedy School graduates may encounter again in real-world politics—Harvard’s graduate school of government elected its new student body president.
Five candidates, including two international students and one former military serviceman, ran for president.
After the initial election, Rohit Malhotra, a second-year Masters in Public Policy student, held 37 percent of the vote. Behind him was Mariana Filgueira Risso, the only female candidate, with 32 percent.
Because no candidate won a majority, the two went head-to-head in a run-off election. Malhotra won, with 59 percent of the 631 votes cast in the run-off election, slightly fewer than the number of students who initially voted.
A minor scandal broke out when Filgueira Risso’s campaign spent more than the $100 allotted to each candidate for the election.
“In a voluntary disclosure form, which we had everyone fill out, she admitted to overspending her budget,” said Daniel J. Hatem, a Kennedy School student and chairman of the Electoral Politics Professional Interest Council that administered the election. “She admitted to $111, I think, but it had to have been more than that because she didn’t include her domain name. So it was in excess of $111, but it wasn’t a huge amount,” said Hatem.
Filgueira Risso said, “We spent a little more on the campaign. It was completely in good faith; we didn’t think that it would matter, that it was affecting our campaign or benefitting us, really. So we declared it very innocently.”
Hatem considered disqualifying Filgueira Risso for the violation. Instead, the election committee decided to take away everything she had bought while campaigning for the first vote and to strip her of the additional $50 she would have received for a run-off budget.
“I understood that I had to have a penalty, no matter how much good faith I had done this in. But I thought it was excessive. And I thought they should have given me more of an opportunity to speak with and have a meeting with the election committee,” Filgueira Risso said.
After Filgeira Risso’s penalty was announced, Malhotra decided not to use campaign materials as well.
“We weren’t in real world politics. We’re a small community. If our community experiences any sort of disruption, it will hurt the rest of the year. So my decision, which I’m proud of, was to also not use my old materials and also to forfeit my run-off budget,” Malhotra said. “I think it was the right thing to do. I did it not out of any sort of political intention.”
Both candidates said they thought Filgueira Risso’s overspending and her subsequent reprimand did not affect the outcome of the election.
Malhotra, who served as the vice president of student activities in his first year at the Kennedy School, already has experience holding the presidential position that he just won. Over the summer, he worked as interim president of the student body. While holding down a full-time job at the White House, he said, he worked on student government projects on his lunch hour.
“It’s not politics so much as it someone who is going to represent you and will be very real with you as to what the problems are,” he said. “From day one, I’ve decided not to put on a front and to be someone I’m not. I’ll be who I am and I’ll work very hard, and I think the students saw that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A settlement between Google and the Association of American Publishers reached Thursday will allow U.S. publishers to decide whether or not their books or journals are digitized by the Google Books Library Project—an online repository of nearly 15 million books and journals, nearly one million of which came from Harvard.
Thursday’s decision has been seven years in the making. The Authors Guild and the AAP, which represents more than 300 publishing houses, filed a lawsuit in 2005 claiming that Google had violated copyright laws by scanning copyrighted books without publisher permission. Although Google agreed three years later to pay $125 million to authors and publishers whose work they had already scanned, the settlement was nullified in 2011 by a federal court, which decided that the subscription and purchase costs proposed by Google for copyrighted work presented an unfair advantage to the company. Litigation with the Authors Guild remains ongoing.
Harvard was one of the first academic libraries to participate in the Library Project, joining along with Stanford, Oxford, Michigan, and the New York Public Library in 2004. At that time Google planned to digitize 40,000 books from Harvard’s collection, a project then-director of the Harvard University Library Sidney Verba ’53 welcomed as exciting progress for scholarship.
“[The project] has people go to Google and find references to books,” he told The Crimson in 2005. “That’s the reason I think it’s great.”
The Library Project ultimately scanned nearly 850,000 of Harvard’s out-of-copyright volumes, but as of now will get no closer to the rest of the University’s collection, which numbers almost 17 million. In 2008, following Google’s tenuous settlement with the AAP and the Author’s guild, Harvard expressed concern at the legal implications of scanning copyrighted material and stepped away from the partnership.
Instead, a group of open-access advocates from around the country’s libraries and universities have come together under the leadership of University Librarian Robert C. Darnton ’60 and former law professor John G. Palfrey ’94 to assemble the Digital Public Library of America, an effort much like Google’s to digitize all published books and open up the resources of America’s major research collections to scholars around the world. Unlike the Library Project, DPLA is a non-profit endeavor seen more as an online public library. It is slated to open in April 2013.
Google has long contended that the Library Project is an attempt to increase accessibility and exposure to published material. The project provides both full-text and limited viewing access. The company originally envisioned scanning every book in the world—an ambition that has been hindered by concerns from the publishing industry.
“Our goal is to improve access to books—not to replace them,” it writes in the online description of Google Books and the Library Project. “Copyright law is supposed to ensure that authors and publishers have an incentive to create new work, not stop people from finding out that the work exists. By helping people find books, we believe we can increase the incentive to publish them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Leaders of Harvard Library touted the successful integration of Harvard’s 73 libraries into a single University library in an interview with The Crimson Wednesday.
“This is unprecedented,” said Executive Director for the Harvard Library Helen Shenton. “We’ve never done this before. Harvard’s never done this before.”
But librarians interviewed by The Crimson said that from their perspective working within the system, the dust has far from settled.
On Aug. 1, the University officially completed a library reorganization that has been over two years in the making. Harvard has described the effort as a move to adjust the library’s resources to the needs of the 21st century by reducing inefficiencies in the system and investing in innovation and advancement.
In an email sent Thursday to Harvard faculty by University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, he described the restructured organization as “off to a promising start.”
Garber could not be reached for comment for this article.
A new online Harvard Library portal, which consolidates functions that were previously spread across a number of websites, is among the more visible changes. The restructuring also created several new departments whose employees serve the same function across the entire system, allowing library to minimize overlap and increase efficiency.
Despite administrators’ confidence in the effectiveness of the transition, librarians described Harvard Library as being in a state of limbo, with many of the potential benefits of the reorganization yet to be realized.
Under the new organization, jobs were renamed and positions reshuffled such that some workers now report to supervisors they had never interacted with in the past.
According to Shenton and Senior Associate Provost for the Harvard Library Mary Lee Kennedy, workers went through orientations over the summer to acclimate them to the new system.
Kennedy and Shenton said that helping workers adjust to the reorganized system is an ongoing process, one that will continue in the months to come.
The Crimson spoke to 23 librarians for this story, 14 of whom declined to comment on this article. Those who agreed to an interview were granted anonymity so that they could maintain relations with administrators.
“There are increasing amounts of chaos because things are still in transition,” said one librarian. “People have moved on or moved to different places and we haven’t had any communication about who’s in charge now for specific functions.”
The librarian acknowledged the need for changes to the library system, but said that the execution has made her job more difficult. She also said she believes that the current problems would eventually be fixed.
The reorganization left the library staff 12 percent smaller than it was last year. Sixty-five employees accepted early retirement packages as part of the Library’s Voluntary Early Retirement Incentive Program. In early July, Harvard Library laid off an additional six workers.
Administrators said streamlining and an emphasis on efficiency allow the new Harvard Library to operate with fewer employees. But librarians, who overwhelmingly characterized the system as “understaffed,” said that the reductions have detracted from quality of service.
“My work has not been negatively impacted yet, but I feel it will be as this understaffing continues,” said one librarian. “As there are fewer [library workers], trying to do the same amount of work as before, there’s bound to be delays, unanswered questions, and unhappiness from library patrons.”
Shenton said she recognizes that some difficulties were to be expected.
“I don’t underestimate the complexity of what we’ve done,” she said. “It’s early days, if you think that this has been probably the biggest change in the library ecosystem. It will take time for it all to work through and for us to look very closely at how we do things and how can we do things better and how can we do things differently.”
Kennedy said that while some confusion was to be expected when dealing with such a massive project, the very nature of the transition has left Harvard Library more unified than ever and capable of dealing with potential issues.
“We are going to make mistakes, everyone is going to make mistakes,” said Kennedy. “But the fact that we’re going to figure this out together in a way that wasn’t possible before is really quite phenomenal.”

Harvard students can look forward to Greek recipes in their dining halls after Thanksgiving break, when several concoctions created by Greek-American chef Diane Kochilas will be featured in the winter menu.
David P. Davidson, managing director of Harvard University Dining Services, invited Kochilas to dream up food for Harvard dining halls when he met her at a conference in California last year.
Many in the Harvard foodie crowd have had a chance to preview Kochilas’ offerings this week.
She dined with Food Literacy Project representatives on Wednesday, met with chefs on Thursday, and provided a cooking demonstration of Greek appetizers—called meze—in Pforzheimer House for students Thursday night.
“Meze is a kind of eating centered around a variety of small plates that are definitely meant to be shared,” Kochilas said during the demonstration in Pforzheimer.
The arrangement matters as much as the ingredients, she said, telling amateur chefs to pay attention to varieties in color, mixtures, spices, and texture. Calling her inclusion in the menu a “tremendous honor,” Kochilas said, “It’s also about sharing what is Greek food. Greek food is often misrepresented and still not very well known.”
Kochilas first ventured into cooking because of her family.
“[Food] was always the center of activity at the house,” Kochilas said. “It’s a conduit for emotion.”
As she demonstrated four different meze dishes, she spoke about Greek food.
“All of the dishes I chose tonight are meatless,” she said. “Professionals in the food world are trying to find ways to make vegetables more appealing.” Greek cuisine often features olive oil, vegetables as main courses, seasonal produce, and very little processed food, Kochilas said.
Kochilas’s recipes will bring a host of foreign words to HUDS menu cards: kalamata chicken, spetsofai, shrimp Mikrolimano, chicken pastitsada, pasta with Greek yogurt and caramelized onions, kakavia, classic spanakorizo, and kotopoulo yiouvetsi.
Alexia A. Zagouras ’16, who is Greek, said she and her family have cooked Kochilas’s recipes before. As she tried the food that Kochilas prepared at the demonstration, Zagourus opined that it tasted authentic.

Paul R. Q. Wolfson ’82, an attorney Harvard retained to defend affirmative action in higher education, outlined the dramatic stakes in the United States Supreme Court’s upcoming consideration of race-based affirmative action in a Thursday conference call with reporters.
This public statement follows Harvard’s reaffirmation in August of its long-time support for the consideration of race in college admissions. The University submitted an amicus brief to the Court defending the University of Texas’s admissions policies. The policies, which allow Texas’ admissions officers to consider race, are currently being challenged in the case of Fisher v. Texas.
“The stakes are very high,” Wolfson said. “It’s very important to the universities and to all the people that depend on them to maintain the ability to structure an incoming class and a student body that is as excellent and diverse as possible.”
The conference call marked a rare occasion in which an attorney retained by Harvard commented on the University’s legal strategy in a live interview. Harvard’s Office of the General Counsel has not granted interviews to The Crimson regarding these strategies in recent years.
Other participants on Thursday’s call largely avoided speculation on the justices’ potential views, opting instead to highlight the benefits of affirmative action and the potential negative outcomes that could arise from striking down the policy.
“If [Fisher] were to prevail, we could live in a very strange world in Texas and perhaps beyond where everything but race could be considered,” said Debo P. Adegbile, acting president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. “Some applicants would need to censor core aspects of their identity, express their identity in ways that don’t ring true with their experiences, or, failing that, have college admissions officers censor their personal stories for them.”
Wolfson, alongside former United States Solicitor General Seth P. Waxman ’73 and attorney Kelly P. Dunbar, authored the brief on behalf of Harvard and 13 peer institutions. The brief defends the consideration of race and ethnicity in admissions as “single factors among many”—a standard established by Harvard and affirmed by the Court as the optimal use of race in the college admissions process.
“Diversity encourages students to question their assumptions, to understand that wisdom and contributions to society may be found where not expected, and to gain an appreciation of the complexity of the modern world,” the brief reads.
The brief relies largely on constitutional precedent established by the Court’s decisions in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke in 1978 and Grutter v. Bollinger in 2003. In both those cases, the justices affirmed the legality of race as an admissions consideration.
The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in Fisher next week and is expected to issue a ruling in the spring.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twenty-six weeks have passed. One hundred and eighty three days have gone by. Four-thousand three-hundred and ninety-two hours have ticked off the clock, and the moment has finally arrived for Jeremy Lin ’10 to step onto the hardwood once more.
Six months after undergoing knee surgery to repair a torn meniscus, Lin has now officially begun practice without limitations. The jersey on his back has changed, though, as he started training camp last Tuesday with the Houston Rockets.
Though the NBA season doesn’t officially start for a little over three weeks, training camp marks the beginning of official team workouts that teach sets, stress conditioning, and build camaraderie. Lin seems to have had no problem with the last of these three, tweeting about his teammates throughout the week. On Monday, the Harvard alum wrote: “Finished up media day...headed to training camp! Excited for the new season to finally start…” It certainly seems from this picture that Lin is enjoying his first media-day since Linsanity began.
Meanwhile, the point guard’s former team, the New York Knicks, had to fend off a tirade of Lin-related questions from the media, mostly relating to the team’s unwillingness to match Houston’s offer of a four-year contract.
“Basically, it comes down to the fact that Houston made a commitment to him that we weren't prepared to make,” said New York General Manager Grunwald. “But I'm very happy for Jeremy that things worked out for him personally and for his family and I wish him the best.”
On the gridiron, Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 and his Buffalo Bills lost to the New England Patriots, 52-28. The loss showcased both the best and worst in Fitzpatrick, who threw for four touchdowns as well as four interceptions. He totaled 350 yards, however, 10 more than Patriot and three-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady collected. The loss dropped the Bills to 2-2, a record that they hope to improve this Sunday against the San Francisco 49ers.
Matt Birk ’98 made headlines this week for his work off the field. Birk wrote an op-ed in the Star Tribune pronouncing his stance against gay-marriage.
“Same-sex unions may not affect my marriage specifically, but it will affect my children -- the next generation,” Birk wrote. “Ideas have consequences, and laws shape culture. Marriage redefinition will affect the broader well-being of children and the welfare of society. As a Christian and a citizen, I am compelled to care about both. I am speaking out on this issue because it is far too important to remain silent.”
His piece has drawn criticism from across the nation.
Meanwhile, those formerly Crimson-clad players now in the professional hockey world are still awaiting the end of a stalemate between the NHL and the NHLPA. The lockout began almost three weeks ago, and it is looking increasingly likely that the start-date of the season will have to be pushed back. Many of the issues revolve around what can be classified as “Hockey Related Revenue,” and thus represent fiscal differences between the two sides.
With the likes of Louis LeBlanc, formerly ’13, and Alex Killorn ’12 waiting, Birk writing, Fitzpatrick wavering, and Lin waving to the cameras, the Harvard alums have shown that in even a relatively slow sports-week, Crimson players will always find a way to be in the headlines.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pinball fans will be in for a treat Saturday as the top two offenses in the Ivy League square off at Harvard Stadium. But the matchup between the Crimson football team and Cornell will offer more than a meaningless arcade-corner duel: it could decide who wins the Ancient Eight.
The Big Red team came closer than any other in the Ivy League to topping Harvard last year, keeping pace with the eventual league champion until the Crimson pulled away for a 41-31 win.
While Harvard was favored to win that game, then-sophomore quarterback Jeff Mathews kept Cornell in the contest with 322 passing yards and three touchdowns through the air. Mathews’ momentum only increased as the year went on, and the gunslinger threw for over 500 yards in each of the year’s final two matchups en route to an Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year nod.
Mathews, the full-time starter since his freshman year, returned this year as the odds-on favorite to win the award again and has not disappointed so far this season. Considered a legitimate NFL prospect, Mathews is currently averaging 369 yards per game through the air and has thrown seven touchdowns through three games.
“They have one of the best QB’s in the country at any level,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “He’s a very special player.”
Mathews could pose a problem for a Harvard secondary that has struggled to stop the pass in two of its first three games. After allowing over 350 passing yards for the first time in almost a decade against San Diego in Week One, Brown quarterback Patrick Donnelly threw for 336 against Harvard the following week.
But the Crimson secondary will receive a long-awaited boost on Saturday with the expected return of senior cornerback Brian Owusu, who sat out the first three games of the season with an injury but was a full participant in practice this week.
“We are excited to have him in this particular game,” Murphy said. “He adds a lot to our nickel package. If we can go with a nickel package of [sophomore] Norman Hayes, [senior] D.J. Monroe, Brian Owusu, maybe [junior] Chris Splinter, plus one of the safeties, that’s a step up.”
Even if Mathews is able to continue his run of success against a healthy Harvard D, the Crimson offensive attack is highly capable of keeping up, if not outpacing, Cornell. Thus far, the offense is averaging a league-high 41.7 points per game.
On the ground, senior running back Treavor Scales has had a career year thus far, averaging 130 yards per game despite only playing in the first half last week in a 52-3 blowout of Holy Cross. In the second half of that game, freshman Paul Stanton took the baton from Scales in stride, averaging nearly 10 yards per carry and foreshadowing the threat of a two-headed attack.
“The Rajun Cajun—he’s the man,” Scales said. “He’s a heck of a presence in the film room...and he’s one of the best ball players I’ve come across. It’s like we bring a couple every year that’ll just knock your socks off as soon as they touch the field.”
As a unit, Harvard leads the Ivy League, averaging 200 yards per game on the ground.
“It’s an attack-mode offense,” Scales said. “Everytime we get out there, we look to light up the scoreboard.”
Scales and co. are hard to stop on their own, but opposing defenses also have to worry about senior quarterback Colton Chapple, who showed flaws in Week One, but has been impressive since then. Last week, Chapple earned Ivy League Offensive Player of the Week honors for the third time after throwing for 260 yards and four touchdowns before being pulled at halftime.
Chapple will try to follow that performance with one reminiscent of what he did to the Big Red last year. In what was then his best performance yet, Chapple threw for 414 yards, the second highest total in program history, and four scores the last time these two teams met, including three timely scores in a seven-minute span when the Crimson was down 24-20.
To  keep up with the Big Red attack, Chapple may have to repeat that kind of a success against an improved Cornell defense. Last year, the Big Red surrendered 30 points in seven of its 10 contests. In the last two weeks, Cornell’s opponents have combined to tally just 16 points, though Fordham did score 34 in Week One.
“The thing that’s changed the most about their team is that all of a sudden they are playing strong defense,” Murphy said. “They are a lot better of a defensive football team then they were a year ago, and that makes them very dangerous.”
As a whole, the Big Red is a more well-rounded squad than it was last year and appear to be a threat to Harvard’s defense of the Ivy crown.
“It’s clearly a big game,” Murphy said. “We are probably not going to play a team on our schedule that is.as good on offense, good on special teams, and good on defense as this group.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a 1-1 tie against Boston College on Tuesday night, the Harvard men’s soccer team (1-5-3, 0-0-1 Ivy) extended its winless streak to six matches. With the team looking to build momentum, the road won’t be getting any easier this weekend as the Crimson takes on No. 18 Cornell (9-0-0, 1-0-0 Ivy) on Saturday afternoon at Soldiers Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium.
Harvard, which has not won since defeating Michigan State on Sept. 7, is eager to take on The Big Red in search of its first Ivy League win in two years.
“I think they’re going to come out flying and show us a full battle for 90 minutes, but I know we’re going to be ready to battle,” junior defender Ross Friedman said. “We know that’s what the Ivy League schedule is like—it’s a test of who can outlast the other team and who wants it more.”
In Tuesday’s tie with the Golden Eagles, the Crimson jumped out to an early lead, but was unable to hold off BC for the win. Harvard has scored just six goals in nine games on 11.9 shots per game.
“Although we’re not winning a lot [of] games, it’s not like we’ve been playing badly,” sophomore forward Hiroki Kobayashi said. “It’s all about our mentality and how much we want it—so it’s easy to fix.”
The Crimson knows that it needs to capitalize on opportunities in order to compete and put teams away.
“We’ve really shown up to a lot of games,” Friedman said. “We had a lot of scoring opportunities against Boston College. We put one away, but it really should’ve been 3-0.”
But while Harvard has struggled to finish off opponents, the Big Red has absolutely dominated its competition. Cornell is outscoring its opponents 26-7 so far this season.
Junior forward Daniel Haber has posted a whopping 14 goals and five assists for a total of 33 points.  He leads all NCAA D-I men’s soccer players with an average of 3.67 points per game and 1.56 goals per contest, and had a hat trick in a 4-0 win against Buffalo on Sept. 9th.
But, Haber is not Cornell’s only threat; sophomore midfielder Conor Goepel has four goals on the year, and senior Tyler Regan won Ivy League Player of the Week for his one goal, one assist performance against Penn last week. On the defensive end, goalkeeper Rick Pflasterer gives up an average of just 0.79 goals per match. The back end is anchored by a number of tall defenders, including 6-5 junior Patrick Slogic, who have helped Cornell allow just 12 shots on goal this season.
On paper, the Crimson may appear to be in trouble—a team that went winless in the Ivy League last year is now taking on an explosive offense and a nationally ranked opponent—but things may not be what they seem.
Harvard believes that its tough out-of-conference schedule, which included games against the Spartans, No. 2 UConn, No. 4 UCSB, and Boston College, has it well prepared to take on the top teams in the Ancient Eight.
“We have faced a much tougher schedule than they have, so we’re not reading too much into their being undefeated,” Friedman said. “We’ve gone against so many great players that I don’t think we’re going to be surprised by their quality.”
Coach Carl Junot scheduled a deliberately difficult non-conference slate in order to better prepare his team for the ultimate prize—the Ivy League.
“Our goal is to win Ivy League,” Kobayashi said. “So in all the games against the good teams we’ve played so far, winning really wasn’t our first priority. Our first priority was preparing ourselves for Ivy play, and I think we did a very good job.”
By comparison, Cornell has faced no ranked opponents, and has run over the likes of Wofford, Binghampton, and Hartwick.
The Crimson is relying on Kobayashi, who leads the team with two goals, and senior Zack Wolfenzon, who leads the team with 19 shots, to deliver offensively against the Big Red. The team will also look to rally behind a defense led by freshman goalkeeper Joe Festa, who has started the last four games and posted a save percentage of 77.4 percent, good for fourth in the Ivy League.
Harvard is confident that its team chemistry will help it as the season progresses.
“The rest of the season, we’re not going to see as good teams as we’ve faced thus far,” Friedman said. “Going forward, we’re not scared of anyone, we know that we can compete with the best, and that gives us a lot of confidence heading onto the pitch.”

With September in the books, Harvard men’s water polo team (12-6, 4-0) travels to California this weekend where the Crimson faces a slew of highly competitive water polo clubs in No. 10 Long Beach State (12-3), Pomona-Pitzer (1-11),  No. 9 Loyola Marymount (7-6), Claremont-Mudd-Scripps (2-12), and No. 2 UC Santa Barbara in the Gary Troyer Claremont Convergence.
Harvard, fresh off a loss on Sunday to Bucknell (6-8) that ended its first nine-game winning streak since 2002, will look to improve on its road record (2-3) and gain experience playing against several elite teams.
“We are pretty even-keeled right now,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “We realize that there are a lot of games left to play and that we have to take every chance to learn from our failures.”
The Crimson has rallied around the hot play of several of its stand-out freshman players including Ben Zepfel, Blake Lee, and Noah Harrison to race to its best 18-game start since 2002 and stay undefeated in conference play.
“At this point we are trying to get better as a team in every aspect,” Minnis said. “Three out of five of the teams we play [this weekend] are in the top 10. We are looking to improve in all aspects [of our game].”
Harvard begins its weekend in the Golden State with a match against Long Beach State. Ranked 10th in the country, the 49ers feature a stingy defense helmed by sophomore goalie Balint Meszaros. 
The 49ers won’t be the only top 10 team that the Crimson faces this weekend as Loyola Marymount and UC Santa Barbara are both similarly ranked.
Coming off an 11-10 upset win over former No. 2 UCLA, the No. 2 Gauchos will be the highest ranked team that Harvard will face this season. The No. 9 Lions also present a stiff challenge to the Crimson. In the only other matchup between the two teams, Loyola Marymount beat Harvard soundly,19-4, in 2008.
With the playoffs in sight, the Crimson will look to get some sunshine in October and prepare for the postseason.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Radcliffe crew opens its fall season this weekend at the Head of the Housatonic in Shelton, Conn., competing in eights, fours, and pairs. The heavyweight and lightweight boats will face off against crews such as UMass, Williams, Brown, and rival Yale, among others.
As the first regatta of the season, the race has a more relaxed atmosphere to it, according to Radcliffe coach Liz O’Leary. A 2.7-mile head race as opposed to the spring’s 2000-meter head to head, this weekend presents the Black and White with an opportunity for many boats—and as a result, many members of both teams—to  race.
“We are trying to get as much of our team as possible out on the race,” O’ Leary said.
The course on the Housatonic River, one of Yale’s home courses along with the Thames River, is situated between two dams in Indian Well State Park. This year marks the 18th annual race.
Both the light and heavyweight boats for Radcliffe finished last season very strongly and return major parts of their lineups.
To cap off its 2011-12 season, the lightweight first varsity eight earned a bronze at the Eastern Sprints, considered the championships for lightweight crew. In an exciting finish, the fourth-ranked Black and White edged out then top-ranked Wisconsin to medal in the prestigious event.
The success was not limited to the 1V alone. The second eight won the first gold for Radcliffe at the race in half a decade, and the novice boat earned bronze as well.
The Radcliffe lightweights return six rowers from last year’s first varsity boat and a majority of the girls returning to the second varsity boat as well.
The lightweight Black and White will send two eights, two fours, and two doubles to this weekend’s regatta. As the only lightweight team in the open regatta, the Black and White will face stiffer competition than it will for much of the remainder of the year.
“Hopefully we can get a top-10 finish with the [first varsity eight]. That would be a very good finish for us,” said Radcliffe lightweight coach Michael Bartman.
The race is one of the few times both Black and White crews can go head-to-head. Once the spring comes, the races are no longer open.
Like its lightweight counterpart, the Radcliffe heavyweight first varsity eight also finished last year on a high note with a victory in the first-ever Ivy Championships. Seeded fifth, the Black and White finished 2.6 seconds ahead of second-place Cornell and four seconds behind top-seeded Princeton.
The heavweights boast a large senior class, with 13 rowers in their final year. According to O’Leary, they have formed the core of a strong base this season.
“One notable thing [about our team is] a big, strong, dynamic senior class,” Coach O’leary fondly stated.  “I look to them for leadership and setting the tone.”
The large senior class will not prevent underclassmen from earning experience, though, as a number of seniors are currently studying abroad or nursing injuries.
Last year at the Housatonic, the Radcliffe Heavyweights split with Yale. While the Radcliffe 2V topped Yale’s second boat, the Black and White 1V finished behind the Bulldogs first eight before avenging that loss in the Ivy League Championships.
Two weekends later, both teams will compete in the Head of the Charles the major spectacle for rowing in the Boston area. The event attracts nearly 9,000 athletes and 300,000 spectators to the Charles River annually and is the largest two-day regatta in the world.
“Head of Housatonic is used to get into the racing rhythm for Head of the Charles,” Bartman said.
For both teams, the Housatonic serves as a starting block for the rest of the year. No matter the result, the teams will have ample to improve until the championships at year’s end.
“The [Head of the Housatonic] is in October, [and] the Ivy Championships are in May. That’s a long time,” O’Leary said, calling the Housatonic gentle introduction into “a long and strenuous season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After capturing its first conference win of the season against Penn last Saturday, the Harvard women’s volleyball team looks to pick up steam as it faces two more Ivy League opponents, Brown and Yale, this weekend at the Malkin Athletic Center.
Wins against the Bears and the first place Bulldogs would put the Crimson (4-10, 1-2 Ivy) at the center of the race for the Ivy League title. Harvard currently trails Yale (7-5, 3-0) and Princeton (6-7, 3-0) by two games.
The Crimson has had its share of close contests this season, as four of its last five matches have stretched into the fifth set. Following a 2-3 loss to Princeton the day earlier, Harvard was able to pull out a win in a back-and-forth match against the Quakers that also took five games to decide.
“[Beating Penn] was awesome, just because the team has worked hard consistently throughout the season,” Crimson coach Jennifer Weiss said. “Sometimes volleyball, because of momentum, goes one way or the other and sometimes it comes down to just a few points. That fifth set is really anybody’s ballgame, and you have to be prepared for the fifth set.”
Before the win against Penn (6-8, 1-2), Harvard had lost all four of its five-set matches this season. According to captain Taylor Docter, defeating the Quakers is proof that the Crimson has what it takes to pull out big victories in the closing points.
“I think that it was a really crucial win because it shows that we can win in that fifth game,” Docter said. “Hopefully we’ll do that in the future.”
Harvard will have two more chances to improve its conference record this weekend, as Brown (4-9, 0-3) comes to town on Friday before the Crimson faces Yale in a big matchup the next day.
Although the Bears have had their share of struggles this season, the team comes into Cambridge having pulled out a close, four-set victory against Rhode Island in its last game. Brown is led by sophomore outside hitter Maddie Lord, who has more than twice the number of kills of any of her teammates.
The Bears are winless in the Ivy League this season, but in a sport like volleyball, one momentum swing can decide a game.
“Every team [in the Ivy League] is so well matched and such a similar caliber that a lot of games go to five,” Docter said. “For a lot of them you feel like it could go one way or the other.”
The Bulldogs, Harvard’s Saturday night opponent, have proven to be a difficult matchup lately, as the team has won four straight games, only dropping a single set along the way.
Junior setter Kendall Polan, last year’s Ivy League Player of the Year, highlights the Yale offense. Polan leads the team with 290 assists, and ranks third with over 100 kills.
Although both Weiss and Docter noted the effectiveness of Yale’s attack, the Crimson has been working to come up with a strategy to counteract the strengths of the Bulldogs.
“They’re a very consistent team,” Weiss said. “They have a great right side attack, but there are some things that we’re going to capitalize on. Every opponent you try to find some of their weaknesses and try to capitalize on that, and I think we have our goals in line in practice yesterday and today.”
Harvard will need solid production from its regular contributors to be able to successfully execute its gameplan. Although Docter leads the team in kills, the win against Penn was characterized by a balanced Crimson attack.
Docter, freshman outside hitter Kathleen Wallace, and junior right side Erin Cooney each registered 14, 14, and 13 kills, respectively, in the win. Harvard’s two main setters, senior Beth Kinsella and freshman Hannah Schmidt, accounted for 25 and 24 assists.
“I think the other girls have been stepping up a lot, and that we have a really, really solid group of underclassmen right now,” Docter said. “I don’t even think about the fact that I lead in kills because I feel like every other game everyone has at least close to as many as I do.”
Weiss believes that the Crimson’s recent close matches have gone a long way toward preparing the team for its upcoming crucial conference showdowns as the team heads into the heart of the Ivy League season trailing Yale and Princeton by two games in the loss column.
“We want to stay where we are now in terms of our practice and really coming in and fighting every day,” Weiss said. “This is truly a group that is giving 100 percent effort in practice, and that’s going to be evident as we get to these emotional matches.”
Added Weiss, “I think when we have an opportunity to close it, we need to close it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the conclusion of a busy week of field hockey, where Harvard (3-7, 1-2 Ivy) will have played four games in eight days, the Crimson is set to face off against Bucknell (6-6, 1-0 Patriot) Sunday afternoon at Jordan Field.
Coming off of a 4-1 loss to No. 8 Northeastern on Wednesday, in which Harvard trailed 4-0 at the half but came back to outshoot the Huskies in the game overall with a strong second period, the Crimson will look to carry the second half’s momentum into the weekend.
“I think the second half should be a focus point for our game on Sunday,” Harvard coach Tjerk van Herwaarden said. “If we play like we did in the second half then we should be able to compete really well with Bucknell. We’ll keep the pace high, we’ll keep attacking very quickly and we’ll be able to make the adjustments for the competition in practice.”
Though the Crimson has been slow out of the gate recently, the Bison have also been prone to weak first halves, especially relative to their second half performances. Overall, Bucknell has outscored its competition just 12-10 in the first half but 20-12 in the second.
Bison junior goalie Erica Perrine has led Bucknell’s defense, coming up with most of the Bison’s 41 saves in second half—compared to just 28 in the first—alongside a 2.10 goals against average and .716 save percentage.
Looking to beat the Bucknell defense will be Harvard sophomores Noel Painter and Caitlin Rea, who lead the team in goals and assists, respectively. Painter also leads the team in points with 10 (four goals and two assists).
The Bison offense is led by senior Tayler Siegrist and junior Rachel Misko, who have seven and five goals each, respectively.
Co-captain Cynthia Tassopoulos has played the majority of games in net thus far for the Crimson, recording two shutouts and a 1.96 goals against average along with a .787 save percentage.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the Harvard football team hosting Cornell on Saturday afternoon, we caught up with The Cornell Daily Sun’s Quintin Schwab over email to get an inside look at Big Red football. Check out what Schwab had to say below:
The Harvard Crimson: What can Harvard expect from Cornell on Saturday night?
Quintin Schwab: Harvard can expect a Cornell team ready for the moment. For the last  several years (basically this century), Cornell football has been one of  the laughing stocks of the Ivy League, but in head coach Kent Austin's  second year (2011), things changed. They found an excellent quarterback;  they developed an athletic offensive line; they found playmakers at  wide receiver; they got speed on defense. Now in Austin's third year,  the Red looks like a real football team. And surprisingly, the defense  has outperformed the prolific offense so far. The offense has made  uncharacteristic mistakes through the first three games of the season,  but I wouldn't expect many on Saturday. Cornell may end up on the short  end, but it will not be due to a lack of effort or shying away from the  magnitude of the game.
THC: Just how good is Jeff Mathews, and how has his game changed from last season?
QS: Mathews is all he's made out to be and more. Like  Colton Chapple, he has near-lethal accuracy. He has a rocket arm. He's  big. He's tough. He's smart. But it's not even his precise mechanics and  fundamentals that make him an excellent quarterback; it's also his  leadership and humility. As Coach Austin always likes to say, Mathews  makes all the coaches better coaches. In terms of his growth from last  year, he's simply just adding more tricks to the bag (e.g., throwing on  the run and pocket awareness) and developing as the unquestioned leader  of the football team.
THC: Give us your prediction: How many passing yards will he finish the season with?
QS: Mathews, now with 1107 yards, will finish the season with around 3300 yards, actually fewer than last year.
THC: While the Cornell offense was obviously pretty sharp last year, the defense appears to be much improved. What do you attribute that to?
QS: The defense does indeed look much improved, but  it will be put to the ultimate test this weekend. Coordinator Kim  Dameron has put more athleticism on the field this year (e.g. two  freshman cornerbacks) and has simplified their defensive scheme. But we  all know it ultimately comes down to the players. They are sick of being  viewed as the unit that holds back a great offense, and they have trust  in each other. They are simply more active this year than in years  past. The defense's main issues last year came in between the 20's (they  actually had a good red zone defense), but this year they've cleaned up  their mistakes and have bent less in the middle of the field (don't  have statistics, but my hunch is that they've allowed fewer than 10  plays of 20 yards or more). The backups, which used to translate to end  of story when they were put in the game, are able to come up with huge  plays and contributions like they did last week against Bucknell. And  the offense has certainly helped out, putting together long drives and  giving the defense long rests (although they haven't executed in scoring  territory well).
THC: Cornell senior center and offensive co-captain Bob Bullington was out last week. What does he bring to the Big Red offense, and will we see him back in action on Saturday?
QS: Bullingon is huge, arguably the second most  important player on the team after Mathews, and we saw that last week  when the replacement repeatedly snapped low or rolling balls to Mathews.  Bullington is the vocal leader of the offensive line and an excellent  player. He is a warrior, as he actually played the first two weeks  snapping with his left hand because of his broken and casted right wrist  suffered in the offseason. I have a feeling the decision to hold him  out against Bucknell was precautionary and in preparation for the big  showdown against Harvard. So expect number No. 64 to be back and  delivering some fine snaps to Mathews, which will relieve the whole  offensive unit.
 THC: Final score prediction?
QS: Final score: Harvard 31, Cornell 26

Have you ever wanted to get some Jeremy Lin '10 apparel at the COOP? Bloomberg News suggests that your dream might soon become a reality. A recent article reported that Houston Rockets point guard Jeremy Lin may be talking with Nike and Harvard about a co-licensed merchandise deal.
According to Paul Swangard, managing director of the Warsaw Sports Marketing Center, this deal could potentially improve Harvard's brand image in China. "To millions of Chinese children, the NBA and Harvard are separately 'aspirational brands' and Lin is uniquely positioned to align their messages," Swangard was quoted as saying.
The contracts haven't been signed yet, but here's to hoping this leads to a clothing line as popular as CS50 apparel.
Here are a few items we'd most like to see:
Sweatpants – How else will you show your J-Lin support during reading period?
Socks – Because the inside of your feet should know which Houston Rockets player you support.
Leverett Housing Day shirts – Lin, who lived in Leverett as an undergraduate, is now one of the House's most famous alum. Newly dubbed Leverites couldn't have a better role model.
Cleats – So what if Lin plays basketball? It's much more important that you don't let a soccer game get in the way of your Lin fandom.

Every week, The Crimson publishes a selection of articles that were printed in our pages in years past.
October 4, 1918: Influenza Well in Hand
Cases of Spanish influenza, at the University and among the students in the S.A.T.C. have been kept well in hand throughout this week, and at present Stillman Infirmary, where the influenza cases are being treated, has the best record of any hospital in the vicinity. There are now about 60 cases of influenza at Stillman, but there have been no deaths from the disease. In the Boston hospitals there has been an average mortality of 20 percent of all influenza cases admitted. At Camp Devens, where there are some 48,000 men, there have been 15,000 cases and 590 deaths.
October 3, 1928: Former Crimson President in N.Y. Gubernatorial Race
F. D. Roosevelt '04 was yesterday nominated by the Democratic party to succeed Governor Smith as governor of New York state. It was with great difficulty that the Democrats finally secured Mr. Roosevelt's acceptance of the nomination.
September 30, 1955: No Wives for Gong Found in Hong Kong
A former Student Council representative and Yard proctor announced publicly this month that he is looking for a wife. At present, he is looking in Hong Kong, but he reports that he had much rather resume the search in Cambridge.

October 5, 1957: Russians Launch Artificial Satellite
Russia's announcement that she had successfully launched a space satellite sent University astronomers into a flurry of activity last night as they alerted observation posts throughout the world to be on the watch for the Soviet artificial moon.
The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory at 79 Garden St., in association with the Harvard College Observatory, is the national headquarters of "Operation Moonwatch," the network of observers set up to track the U.S. satellite when it is launched.
October 6, 1965: 'Mary Poppins' Creator Arrives at Whitman Hall
"I have the same feeling about rocking chairs as I do about merry-go-rounds. You can go places in both, you know."
P. L. Travers, author of the Mary Poppins books, dispensed no-nonsense advice (your favorite flavor) and tart opinions last night after her arrival in Cambridge to be Radcliffe's "writer-in-residence."
She saw Disney's version of Mary Poppins—"Oh, Lord yes, I did, I did"—but would say no more. She wouldn't tell, either, if she was planning another Mary Poppins book.
"As soon as you tell about something you're going to write, it evaporates," Miss Travers reprimanded an inquisitive reporter. "If you're going to have a baby, you can't pull it out after three months and say, 'What does it look like now.'"
October 6, 1973: Harvard Endorses 3 Women for Male-Restricted Rhodes
Harvard yesterday broke with a 71-year-old tradition by endorsing women applicants for the Rhodes Scholarship, restricted by law since its founding to candidates who exhibit "qualities of manhood."
