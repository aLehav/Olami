On December 25 at 11:56 p.m., I realize that it’s our last Christmas in this house.
I’m looking at my watch and thinking about how fast the holidays go—how repetition speeds time up—and it hits me that one year from now, in what will inevitably feel like less than that, my family won’t be celebrating Christmas here in this room.
My house (which has always felt natural to say, except maybe until now) was built over 100 years ago, at the end of the nineteenth century. I’ve never really thought about how there’s been something sturdy beyond its walls—in knowing how long this house has stood here, imagining everything it’s seen.
Tonight, my mom tells me that only three other families had lived in this house before we moved in. Four families, including us: It doesn’t seem like a lot, but it suddenly becomes so when I try to conjure up the mothers and grandfathers who’ve walked through these rooms, the children that might—or might not—have raced downstairs like my sister and I used to on Christmas Eve.
I’ve always said I’m not particularly attached to this place, but I’m starting to think more about how an empty space became something my family grew into, something more than a combination of wood and brick.
Sixteen years later, we’ve grown out of it. A year from now, our house will watch another recycling: What’s forgotten under a new coat of paint?
Does all this disappear: tables (that wooden one in the kitchen, the one I used to draw on with crayon), chairs (that stool with the uneven legs), bookshelves (with my mom’s favorite cookbooks, outside the kitchen), years?
It’s December 26 now, but in the living room our Christmas tree still glows, under lamps once lit by gas, beams and plaster put up over a century ago. “Don’t you ever wonder who was sitting in this same room, back in 1896?” my mom asks.
Some things, I’ll insist, don’t just vanish.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the launch of a College-approved BDSM club, an international controversy surrounding Harvard Kennedy School student Bo Guagua, and the Harvard baseball team’s wildly popular parody video of the hit song Call Me Maybe, Harvard grabbed headlines in 2012.
While some of those stories captivated the attention of people outside of Cambridge for a moment, others had a sustained and meaningful impact throughout the year on Harvard’s campus. On the last day of the year, The Crimson looks back at the 12 stories from 2012 that mattered the most at Harvard.
12. Harvard Releases a New Alcohol Policy
Capping off months of efforts to tighten its grip on student alcohol consumption, the College released a new set of guidelines in March regulating drinking on campus. The new rules loosened restrictions on hard liquor at formals, while simultaneously seeking to curb dangerous drinking games. Though the new policy was intended to standardize regulation of alcohol across Harvard’s 12 Houses, it drew criticism from the start for vague language that some said left enforcement up to the discretion of individual tutors and gave no clear indication about whether students were permitted to play beer pong. The new policy was approved by the faculty in the fall, but not before professors voiced reservations about whether it could actually be enforced.
Administrators sought to involve students as they drafted and finalized the policy—but undergraduates showed little interest in participating. Following a series of sparsely attended meetings last fall while the policy was being crafted, administrators held three more meetings in April to solicit feedback on the new regulations that drew a total of only five students.
Students started paying closer attention to the new policy when the perceived crackdown spread to the streets. When students returned to campus in the fall, rumors of a police crackdown on partying temporarily dampened the late-night weekend scene. Spokespeople for the Harvard University Police Department and the Cambridge Police Department later confirmed the increased weekend police presence, saying it was intended in part to keep students safe by keeping closer tabs on their alcohol consumption. But in a panel discussion several weeks later, HUPD Chief Francis “Bud” Riley told students that police had not arrested any students that year for alcohol violations and did not plan to start enforcing underage drinking laws any differently.
11. The Rise of a Harvard Basketball Standout Sparks Linsanity
A little over a year ago, professional basketball prospects for Jeremy Lin ’10 looked pretty bleak. After the Golden State Warriors waived him last December, he was signed by the Houston Rockets days later only to be released on Christmas Eve. After agreeing to a contract with the New York Knicks shortly thereafter, Lin received minimal playing time in his first few months and even spent time in the D-League.
But that all changed on Feb. 4. With the Knicks struggling, having lost 11 of their last 13 games, coach Mike D’Antoni turned to Lin, who was in jeopardy of being cut again. And the former Harvard standout delivered, earning 25 points and seven assists to give the Knicks a much-needed victory.
His success hardly stopped there. Behind Lin, the Knicks won nine of their next 12 games, highlighted by Lin's 38-point outburst in a 92-85 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers, and ultimately earned a playoff berth. In the process, Lin sparked a phenomenon later to be known as “Linsanity” that took Harvard by storm, surprising and exciting both students and former teammates and, according to long-time Knicks fan Spike Lee, “elevating the [Harvard] brand.”
A knee injury at the end of March sidelined Lin for the rest of the year, but by then he had already left a lasting mark. And despite the meteoric rise of Lin, named in Time Magazine's annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world, he nevertheless maintained his characteristic humility, according to close Harvard friends.
In July, Lin left the Knicks and moved back to the Rockets—the team that had released him just months before—after signing a three-year, $25.1 million dollar contract.
10. Harvard Turns an Eye Towards Mental Health
A year after an anonymous essay published in The Crimson entitled “I Am Fine” sparked a campus-wide discussion about mental health, the sensitive topic of suicide played into the continuing conversation about students' psychological and emotional well-being.
This year, the student body received three emails from Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds with the subject line “Sad News,” each announcing the death of an undergraduate, including one that said that the student had taken his own life. Days after one of the other emails was sent, several media outlets reported that that student had also died by suicide. As the campus community coped with the painful news, student groups continued to expand on previous efforts to address the sensitive topic, while administrators affirmed their commitment to supporting mental health on campus. Working towards a solution, Hammonds created a committee to examine sources of and solutions to student stress. For many, The Crimson served as an outlet to express opinions and share experiences in the response to tragedy.
 
The Crimson also examined the issue with features investigating the University’s handling of mental health. The three-part series found that students may be more depressed than the University would like to admit. Following the narratives of four current undergraduates who have attempted suicide while enrolled at Harvard, the series examined the difficult paths mentally ill students navigate once they enroll at Harvard, the ways University Health Services could better serve them, and the efforts of University officials and student activists to change the disheartening numbers.
9. University Prepares for the Capital Campaign
 
Conversations with senior University administrators and prominent donors revealed Harvard’s plans to launch a more than $6 billion University capital campaign in late 2013. The University continued its march towards the public launch date this past year as administrators began to reveal the campaign’s funding priorities and donors pulled out their checkbooks in support.
 
The University’s efforts to renew the College’s 12 residential Houses, which have an estimated price tag of more than a billion dollars, attracted millions from high-profile donors, including the Hutchins Family Foundation. This past year the University revealed that Dunster House would be the next to be renewed, following the completion of the renovations of Quincy and Leverett Houses.
 
In October, University President Drew G. Faust declared her intention to make the construction of a campus center in the Holyoke Center a campaign priority. For years, the campaign for a student center has been a top priority for student activists.
 
Administrators announced that the long-delayed construction of a science center in Allston would resume in 2014, an indication of what is sure to be one of the University’s top campaign priorities. The building will eventually house academic projects for stem cell science and the engineering and physical sciences. The University also announced plans to construct a new basketball arena to meet the increased demands that have resulted from the success of Harvard’s basketball program.
 
Other priorities, including teaching and learning, have been less clearly defined, but are sure to feature prominently in the campaign.
8. Harvard Sees Two Stranger Rapes in Five Days
The first was on an early August morning in Harvard Yard, reported by a woman who told police she was grabbed and dragged behind Massachusetts Hall. The second was just four days later, reported by a different woman who said she was raped near Oxford and Kirkland Streets. As the first stranger rapes to be reported on Harvard’s campus in more than 12 years, they raised the question: was the close proximity of the two attacks a disturbing coincidence or a sign of a more pervasive safety problem?
As they prepared to return to campus in the aftermath of the attacks, concerned students suspected it was the latter, calling for tightened security and more frequent shuttle service. But as the fall progressed, student activism to prevent campus rape turned towards Harvard’s sexual assault policy. Harvard administrators had said after Yale changed its policies over the summer that they had no plans to change their existing procedures, but students petitioned anyway, creating a referendum question on the issue to be voted on in the November Undergraduate Council presidential election. The ballot question called for Harvard to endorse the requirement for “affirmative consent” to sex, change the language of its assault policies to include additional BGLTQ-friendly language, and make its case review process more transparent. That student referendum passed with the support of 85 percent of students who cast ballots in the election. But administrators resisted the electorate’s call for change, saying that Harvard was nowhere close to reforming its procedures. They did, however, host a panel to clarify and answer student questions about the University’s existing sexual assault policies.
7. Harvard Opens the Office of BGLTQ Student Life and Picks Its First-Ever Director To Lead It
After nearly a year of anticipation, Harvard’s new Office of BGLTQ Student Life held its grand opening in a moment that some called a watershed for institutional support of the BGLTQ community at Harvard. Following student rallies and recommendations from a working group, Hammonds in April 2011 announced plans to create a more visible office in Boylston Hall that would replace the existing student-staffed Queer Resource Center in Thayer basement and to appoint a paid full-time director to lead the new office. But the plans got off to a rocky start when Lisa “Lee” Forest, who was appointed as the new director in September 2011, turned down the position just days before she was slated to start. It was not until summer 2012 that Vanidy “Van” Bailey was tapped as Harvard’s first permanent director of BGLTQ Student Life. Bailey began the position soon after.
With the new office open and Bailey at the helm, BGLTQ students said this fall that they felt more comfortable coming out at Harvard and asking others to use gender neutral pronouns. Administrators joined in, as staffers in the Office of Student Life shared their preferred gender pronouns as an icebreaker at a recent retreat. The Crimson published a scrutiny entitled “Can You Tell?” featuring seven BGLTQ varsity athletes who say that, in fact, one cannot tell the difference between a gay athlete and a straight one.
Despite these positive signs, some have pointed to lingering challenges facing the BGLTQ community at Harvard. In June, Harvard Kennedy School lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy ’93 posted a status update on Facebook voicing concern about the recent departures of seven of his BGLTQ colleagues in what he termed a “queer exodus” from Harvard. Several of those departed colleagues told The Crimson that despite the progress made in 2012, Harvard’s climate for the BGLTQ community and its academic support for BGLTQ studies have room for improvement.
6. Harvard Reorganizes Its Library System
By all measures, 2012 was a transformative year for libraries at Harvard. The system of more than 70 libraries officially became a unified Harvard Library in August. The process—a multi-year effort—was far from seamless.
 
The tumult began with the coming of the new year as senior library administrators announced in January that the reorganization would result in a smaller staff without explaining how cuts would be achieved. Upset about whether this change would include layoffs, library workers protested, wrote letters, and attended meetings while the University struggled to respond. In one instance, library workers were outraged over documents circulated online that suggested that University Provost Alan M. Garber '76 and Library Executive Director Helen Shenton had made light of the situation facing library employees. Throughout the reorganization, Harvard faculty and staff expressed confusion about the process and what it aimed to achieve. In the end, six employees lost their jobs involuntarily.
 
In the face of protest and anger, administrators agreed communication throughout the process could have been improved. “We could have done and plan to do a better job communicating in the future,” Garber told The Crimson. Still, the University explained that a smaller staff was necessary to achieve its larger goal of making the newly unified Harvard Library a model 21st century library.
 
Allowing increased access to Harvard’s collections played a crucial role in the modernization effort. In April, the University announced that it would make more than 12 million records available to the public. More than 17 million of the Library’s documents will be key to the collection of the Digital Public Library of America when it opens next year.
5. Students Advocate For Responsible Investment
Following a year in which “The Protester” made headlines and occupiers shut down Harvard Yard, in 2012 student advocates at Harvard found their stride. In fall 2011, students founded Responsible Investment, a group with the stated goal of “changing the way Harvard manages its money.” In April, Harvard Management Company—the organization tasked with investing the University’s more than $30 billion endowment—announced that it would not reinvest in HEI Hotels & Resorts, a hotel chain that had been criticized for repeated allegations of failure to comply with labor regulations. Students from Responsible Investment and across campus celebrated the announcement as a victory, although HMC President and CEO Jane L. Mendillo denied that the decision was a response to HEI’s labor practices.
 
Activists amped up their efforts late spring semester, calling for greater transparency in Harvard’s investment strategy from HMC. Responsible Investment founded the Fair Harvard Fund, a campaign for a social choice fund within Harvard’s endowment that would be invested with an eye toward social good. The Undergraduate Council endorsed the initiative, and within 10 weeks of its creation over 400 people had donated to the cause.
 
During the fall, students turned their attention to individual investments within Harvard’s portfolio. Divest Harvard, Harvard’s chapter of Students For a Just and Stable Future, called for HMC to divest from companies involved in the fossil fuel industry. That effort, coupled with continued calls for Harvard to create a social choice fund, resulted in two successful student referenda related to the University’s investment strategy.
 
Student activists celebrated the University’s decision in December to create a social choice fund. Contributions to the fund will be invested with an eye towards “social responsibility considerations.” But the fight over divestment remains stalled, as students continue to advocate for changes to the University’s investment strategy after Harvard said that it is is “not considering” divestment. Even so, University leaders have promised to meet with students in the new year to discuss divestment, ensuring that the conversation about Harvard’s investment strategy will continue.
4. Men’s Basketball Goes to March Madness
After a 66-year drought, the Harvard men's basketball team returned to college basketball's biggest stage. The Crimson claimed its first-ever outright Ivy title and in doing so earned a berth in the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1946.
Boasting a 26-4 overall record, the Crimson was tabbed a No. 12 seed and was slotted to face No. 5 Vanderbilt—which was coming off a victory over No. 1 Kentucky in the SEC Championship—in Albuquerque, N.M. In front of a contingent of Harvard fans that included a member of the Crimson's 1946 squad and the Harvard University Band, the Crimson met the Commodores on March 15.
Harvard came out slow, falling behind by double-digits by the end of the first period. But carried by the hot shooting of then-sophomore wing Laurent Rivard—who finished with a team-high 20 points—the Crimson managed to pull within five, 70-65, with 1:51 to go. It was all Vanderbilt from there, as the Commodores closed the game on a 9-5 run to secure a 79-70 victory, ending Harvard’s storybook season.
Although a postseason victory remained elusive, the Crimson’s appearance in the tournament cemented its rise as a force to be reckoned with after decades of mediocrity on the basketball court.
3. Elizabeth Warren Is Elected to the Senate
Just days after declaring her candidacy for the U.S. Senate in September 2011, Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren assured a crowd of supporters that "there's nobody in this country who got rich on his own." That comment, which went viral on YouTube and polarized much of the Massachusetts electorate, set the stage for one of the country's fiercest and most expensive U.S. Senate races in recent history—a race that pulled Harvard into the political spotlight.
Warren and incumbent Republican Scott Brown dueled over everything from taxes, to third-party advertising, to Warren's self-proclaimed Native American heritage, which Brown alleged was little more than a lie. Warren ascended as a national liberal cause célèbre, speaking at the Democratic National Convention and demonstrating close ties to President Obama. The candidates combined to shatter state fundraising records, together bringing in over $70 million. Closer to home, Warren found robust financial and intellectual support from Harvard colleagues, who time and time again stepped up to bat for her campaign.
Beneath the surface of each battle on the campaign trail lay stark differences between the candidates’ fiscal and social stances, with Warren pledging bigger government and a tighter tax code and Brown promising a return to bipartisanship. Brown, a moderate Republican with widespread support at home, was vying for the nearly impossible: reelection in one of the bluest states in the country. But ultimately it was Warren, a leader of the intellectual left and longtime consumer advocate, who successfully transitioned from professor to politician to become the first woman ever elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts.
2. Harvard Launches edX
The University made a Harvard education available to the masses in May when it announced the creation of edX—a free not-for-profit online learning venture founded in partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Diving into the the rapidly growing realm of virtual education, each institution invested $30 million in the program. Administrators touted edX as an opportunity to research the way that people learn as well as its potential to be integrated into the traditional classroom. “This is about experimentation; it’s about research; it’s about rethinking education,” Garber said at the time of the program’s launch.
 
By the time HarvardX—the University’s branch of the virtual learning platform—officially went live for its first day of school in October, over 100,000 people had registered to take Harvard courses online. The platform grew throughout the fall semester. The University of Texas, Wellesley College, and Georgetown University signed on to edX, joining Harvard, MIT, and the University of California, Berkeley, which had become a part of the program over the summer. Two local community colleges announced plans to offer a modified version of edX’s “Introduction to Computer Science and Programming,” an online class based on MIT’s introductory computer science course.
 
In December, edX announced an expanded roster of spring semester classes that includes its first courses in the humanities and social sciences. Still, the realm of virtual learning is new and relatively unexplored territory, and Harvard affiliates remain uncertain about what impact edX might have on the future of higher education.
1. Harvard Investigates an ‘Unprecedented’ Cheating Scandal
Five days before the start of the fall semester, Harvard administrators took the unusual step of calling in media outlets to make an announcement: they had a cheating scandal on their hands bigger than anyone could remember. After being tipped off by a professor who had spotted suspicious similarities in his students’ final take-home exams, the Administrative Board had launched an investigation that expanded to include 125 undergraduates in last spring’s Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress” course. The students were accused of plagiarizing or inappropriately collaborating on the exam, and if found guilty, faced a punishment that could be as severe as the requirement to withdraw from the College for a year.
It was a scandal that would rock Harvard’s campus. Within days, media outlets reported that Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry, the co-captains of the men’s basketball team, planned to withdraw from the College due to their involvement in the scandal. In the classrooms, professors included new guidelines about appropriate collaboration on their syllabi, while still defending take-home exams as a valuable method of assessment. In University Hall, administrators redrew their schedules and pushed aside longterm projects to cope with the fallout of the investigation, and a dean started work in a new position created to address academic integrity on campus.
Shockwaves from the scandal reverberated beyond Cambridge. At Yale, administrators discouraged their own professors from administering take-home exams in the wake of the scandal at Harvard. And on the national stage, the scandal sparked a debate among pundits and observers about academic integrity in the digital age, the proper limits of peer collaboration, and the intersection of athletics and academics on college campuses.
Since their first announcement, administrators have stayed tight-lipped about the ongoing investigation, ensuring that the conversation will continue into 2013.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its last game of 2012, the No. 20 Harvard men’s hockey team looked like it was still on break.
The Crimson’s touted penalty kill—ranked ninth nationally coming into Friday's contest—was nowhere to be found in the second period. After falling behind in the first, Northeastern (6-9-1, 3-8-1 Hockey East) came storming back in the opening minutes of the next period and didn’t slow down, beating Harvard (4-5-1, 3-3 ECAC), 5-1. It was the Crimson’s first loss to the Huskies at Bright Hockey Center since 1978.
“I thought there was a lot of energy in the first period, and we had some great scoring chances,” Harvard Coach Ted Donato said. “After they scored those goals…we had about four or five really good chances, and we either missed the opportunities or their goalie made some big saves.”
Northeastern gained a two-man advantage early in the second period and wasted no time in tying up the game at one apiece when sophomore forward Cody Ferriero—who scored 4 goals in the contest—powered a shot past Crimson junior goaltender Raphael Girard.
Even with senior defensemen Danny Beiga back on the ice after serving time for slashing, Harvard was hard pressed to hold off a rejuvenated Huskies offense. Northeastern pounded the Crimson goal with seven consecutive shots before Ferriero found the back of the net three minutes into the period. Ferriero perfected the Huskies’ second period power play conversion seven minutes later, adding his third goal of the period in the final seconds of a Biega tripping penalty.
“It’s tough when you have to kill them back-to-back like that, in a short period of time,” Donato said. “We had Biega in the box a couple times there and that hurt us. He’s one of our best penalty killers.”
While the team’s penalty kill performance was uncharacteristic, so was its starting lineup. Compounding the loss of freshman forward Kyle Criscuolo earlier this week, senior forward Alex Fallstrom was slated to start but saw no playing time. The two have combined to put up five goals and four assists so far this season.
The Crimson also went without freshman forward Jimmy Vesey, who leads the team with five goals and a .600 faceoff win percentage. Vesey was one of three ECAC players selected to represent the US in the IIHF World Junior Championship in Russia and will return to the squad when competition concludes on January 5th.
“We started the game with 11 forwards,” Donato said. “We started the game with [fewer] players than we can use, and we had everybody in.”
Short-sided from the start, Harvard’s woes continued in the third period, as Northeastern’s leading scorer, freshman forward Kevin Roy, put the Huskies up by three, and Ferriero added his fourth goal of the night to cement the 5-1 victory.
The Crimson’s only goal of the game came five minutes into the first period, when freshman forward Brian Hart received a pass from senior defender Brendan Rempel on the right side and snuck a shot past Northeastern goaltender Chris Rawlings on the Crimson’s first power play.
“[Hart] got the puck in the slot, spun around, and made a good shot,” Donato said. “He’s a guy who we think can really elevate his game for us in the second half, and we’ll need him to as we try to not only improve our power play but improve our overall offensive output.”
Harvard saw five more power play opportunities and failed to capitalize on a single one. The Crimson’s 6.1 percent power play percentage has come as a shock this season after they led the nation with a 27.3 percent success rate last year.
“You always have to work on special teams,” said freshman goaltender Peter Traber, who made his second appearance of the season. “Penalty kill is a huge part of the game, and so is power play. Usually we play a pretty defensive style, so it's low scoring... We can't give up three penalty kill goals.”
The Harvard squad was hard pressed to find its way past Huskies goaltender Chris Rawlings, who notched 34 saves in his 10th complete game of the season. Girard had 24 saves for the Crimson and was spelled by Traber, who added nine saves in the final 12 minutes.
“It's obviously great to get in the net, personally,” Traber said. “But the circumstances for the team weren't great. It's a really disappointing loss.”
With the loss, Harvard fell below .500 for the first time this season. Despite squandering a 1-0 first period lead and allowing five unanswered goals after the break, Donato sees potential in the team’s performance.
“For good parts of the game, we had a lot of good things,” Donato said. “We generated a lot of good scoring chances. The takeaway there is that we need to stay out of the box, especially given the circumstances last night with the number of bodies.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A key return and a collegiate debut highlighted the Harvard wrestling team’s 27th-place performance at the 50th annual Ken Kraft Midlands Championships in Evanston, Ill. this weekend. The Crimson’s six-man lineup posted a 12-12 record in one of the largest tournaments on the NCAA circuit.
After taking the first semester off to work, train, and study for the GMAT, co-captain Walter Peppelman was back on the mat for Harvard on Saturday. The two-time All American and No. 4 seed advanced to the quarterfinal of the 157 lb. division, defeating Blomsburg’s Bryce Busler, 6-1, and Eastern Michigan’s Aaron Sulzer, 7-3, before falling to Wisconsin’s Isaac Jordan, 3-1.
“This is a tough tournament for [Peppelman] to come back to, but he did well,” Crimson coach Jay Weiss said. “It should be interesting to see where he goes this year with the team. This is his last year, so he’s really got to make some adjustments.”
Peppelman sustained a minor knee injury in the second match. After losing in Saturday’s final session off a second-period takedown, he forfeited Sunday’s consolation match with 11th-seeded Ian Miller of Kent State.
“The coaches and I decided that the best decision was to forego today’s competition and look forward to being with the team and working toward the national championship in March,” Peppelman said.
Peppelman, who has finished eighth at each of the last two NCAA championships, has not left teammates and coaches guessing what his end-season goal is this year.
“The goal is to be a national champion,” Peppelman said. “A lot of it is mental and it’s physical…. It’s just training hard and training smart and working on those little areas I need to fix.”
As Peppelman looks to close out his collegiate career, freshman Devon Gobbo’s is just beginning. An ACL injury had kept Gobbo, the younger brother of junior Harvard wrestler Erik Gobbo, off the mat since October of his senior year of high school. In his first match in 14 months, the 165 lb. grappler defeated Northwestern’s Pierce Harger, the No. 6 seed and 11th-ranked wrestler in the country, in a 10-6 decision.
“What a tremendous way to start a college career,” Weiss said. “We were very slow with him. I didn’t want to bring him back too soon…. That [win] just shows the type of talent he has.”
Gobbo dropped his second match to Stanford’s Jim Wilson, 3-2, but rattled off three more wins in the consolation bracket. Gobbo won a major decision over Binghamton’s Vinni Grella, 9-1; defeated Maryland’s Josh Snook, 6-2; and won a close overtime decision over Oklahoma’s Clark Glass, 4-2, before losing to No. 17 Mark Lewandowski of Buffalo, 9-2.
“I think [Gobbo] proved to himself a lot of things, but the big thing is that he can beat and compete with the top guys in the country immediately, and that’s exciting,” Weiss said.
Two other freshmen also represented the Crimson this weekend. Heavyweight Nicholas Gajdzik posted a 2-2 record on the weekend while classmate Jeffrey Ott went 1-2 in the 125 lb. division.
“I think our freshmen had a great tournament,” Peppelman said. “We’ll be looking for bigger and better things in the future.”
Gajdzik defeated Pitt’s Mike Gregory in the first round with a second-period fall before losing to No. 1 seed Jarod Trice of Central Michigan, 11-2. Ott lost his first match to No. 6 seed Jarrod Patterson and recorded his sole win of the tournament through a forfeit from Wisconsin’s Matt Kelliher.
In the 174 lb. division, Junior Cameron Croy registered two wins in the championship bracket before falling in consecutive matches.
Sophomore Patrick Hogan registered a single win in the consolation bracket of the 141 lb. division with a major decision over Northwestern University’s Justin Meyers, 10-1. Hogan lost to Grand View’s Gustavo Martinez, 7-5, in the championship bracket and to Indiana’s Eric Roach, 3-2, in the wrestleback.
Weiss hopes that a weekend of grappling with some of the nation’s top wrestlers will inspire the Crimson as it heads into the dual-meet portion of its season.
“I think every one of them can take away a positive from this tournament,” Weiss said. “They have to raise their level; they have to match their opponents’ intensity and then some, and this tournament makes you do that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a quick Christmas break, Harvard winter athletes have returned to practices and competitions. Will any performances this month that rival these historic January feats?
January 17, 1933: Ian Baldwin Scores Six Goals vs. Brown
This January marks the 80th anniversary of the oldest Harvard men's hockey record on the books. Ian Baldwin '33 scored a single-game record six goals in a 15-3 shellacking of Brown way back when the Crimson practiced at the old Boston Garden. The record has been matched twice--once by Amory Hubbard '53 in 1951 vs. Williams and once by Bill Cleary '56 in 1954 vs. Providence. But given improved goaltending and increased parity since the 1950s, it is unlikely that a Harvard skater will break this record anytime soon.
January 2, 1994: Men's Swimming Upsets No. 5 Florida, 126-117
An unranked Crimson squad stunned the No. 5 Gators--a national swimming powerhouse that has more recently produced the likes of Ryan Lochte.  Florida apparently underestimated Harvard going into what was supposed to be a routine, midseason dual meet.
"They were expecting to roll over us," John Blaney '94 said of the Gator swimmers.
The Crimson, however, got the last jeah with a 126-117 win. Harvard swimmers have also produced some impressive January performances through the Iron Man challenge, a traditional men’s team honor in which one rookie swimmer who “best represents the ideals of Crimson swimming” must race in every event of a dual meet.
January 28, 2003: Harvard 17, Boston College 2
At the height of the Ruggiero-Botterill glory years, the Crimson set the record for the largest margin of victory in an NCAA women's hockey game by thumping the Eagles, 17-2. Jennifer Botterill '02-03 established single-game NCAA marks for points (10) and assists (7), and Julie Chu ’06-’07 recorded a hat trick with a game-high four goals. Perhaps more interestingly, fourth-liner Sarah Holbrook tallied her only three goals of the season (and more than half the goals that she would score in her four-year collegiate career) in the 60-minute romp. The win was the Crimson’s 12th in a 27-game unbeaten streak that ended in the 2003 ECAC final versus Dartmouth.
January 15, 2004: Hana Peljto Puts up 39 vs. Lafayette
In a 73-52 win over Lafayette, Hana Peljto '04 tied the Harvard women's basketball single-game points record set by Allison Feaster '98 with extraordinary ease. In the first half, Peljto attempted one more shot than the entire Leopards squad combined. After Peljto helped put the game well out of reach in the second half with one of her 16 field goals, Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith decided to rest Peljto with about a quarter of the game left to play.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
MORAGA, Calif.— Trailing the Harvard men’s basketball team, 69-68, with 1.1 seconds remaining in Monday night’s contest, St. Mary’s forward Mitchell Young found himself at the free throw line shooting one-and-one. And the senior—whose team closed the second half on a 12-1 run—came through in the clutch for the Gaels, knocking down both attempts to give his team its first lead of the contest.
After a Crimson timeout, sophomore Steve Moundou-Missi launched a desperation pass toward the other end of the court but Harvard—which led by as many as 18 points on New Year’s Eve—didn’t connect in the final second, falling to the heavily favored St. Mary’s squad, 70-69, at McKeon Pavilion.
“[I’m] incredibly disappointed,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We felt we outplayed them for the majority of the game.”
With 3:56 to play, sophomore Jonah Travis—who ended the contest with a game-high 19 points—dunked the ball to push Harvard’s then-dwindling lead to 10. But from there, it was all St. Mary’s. The Crimson (7-5) added just one more point to its total—a single free throw with 1:30 to play from co-captain Christian Webster—as the Gaels (11-3) closed the gap.
“It was one of those dream stories, and fortunately we were on the positive end of it,” said St. Mary’s coach Randy Bennett.
Young converted a layup and four free throws in the final 3:36 of the game to end the contest with a team-high 16 points. On the other end, Harvard turned the ball over three times and missed two free throws during that final stretch.
“We made too many critical mistakes with handling the basketball, not making foul shots,” Amaker said. “We couldn’t come up with a defensive rebound, a critical one, to see if we could seal this game.”
St. Mary’s earned a total of 16 offensive boards to Harvard’s six over the course of the game, though both teams ended the contest with 21 rebounds on defense.
“I’m really disappointed for our kids because I thought we played incredibly well,” Amaker said. “We gave up too many offensive rebounds and that’s a formula for disaster.”
Despite entering the second game of its West Coast swing as 12-point underdogs, Harvard held a commanding 35-21 lead over St. Mary’s at halftime.
But the Gaels crawled back into the contest, thanks in part to an impressive second-half effort from deep. After shooting just over 11 percent from three-point range in the first half, the Gaels knocked down their first five attempts in the second, pulling within 10 points of the Crimson with 16:40 remaining.
“We got a little too comfortable after halftime,” Travis said. “That gave them the perfect opportunity to hang in there and get the W. That just shows [that] it’s not how you start, it’s how you finish.”
But sharpshooting from the Harvard guards—Chambers and Rivard were a combined 8 for 9 from three-point range on the game—helped the Crimson maintain a lead for all but one second of the second half.
Harvard came out strong at the start of the contest, claiming a 9-3 advantage in less than four minutes of play—headed by a six-point effort from Travis—and did not relinquish the advantage at any point in the opening frame.
“It was amazing,” said Amaker of Travis’ performance Monday night. “I thought he played his butt off. We missed not having him in there with foul trouble and then we fouled out at the end.”
St. Mary’s cut the Crimson lead to two points at 11:56, as Gaels’ forward Brad Waldow knocked down one-of-two free throws to make it 14-12. But an 18-2 Harvard run in the ensuing 8:51 pushed the Crimson to an 18-point lead with 2:35 remaining in the contest.
Moundou-Missi and freshman point guard Siyani Chambers led the way for the Crimson during that stretch, with six points apiece. Moundou-Missi converted an and-one layup and followed up with his first three pointer of the season, while the rookie knocked down back-to-back threes.
With 51.9 seconds to play in the period, St. Mary’s guard and leading scorer Matthew Dellavedova scored his only two points of the half on a pair of free throws, and he finished the game with a season-low four points. Sophomore Wesley Saunders was tasked with defending the guard for a majority of Monday night’s contest.
“That’s a lot to ask of person but he’s definitely stepped up to the challenge,” said Travis of Saunders’ defensive effort. “He’s definitely a big reason why we’ve had the success that we’ve had.”
Though the Gaels struggled from the field in the first frame, shooting just 22.6 percent from the field and one of nine from three-point range, St. Mary’s staged a comeback with an impressive 17 for 26 shooting effort in the second.
“They made all the plays necessary down the stretch to win it, and I think to steal it, to be very honest,” Amaker said.

Every December, past and present Harvard affiliates come together at gatherings and parties across the country to make merry and recognize their holiday traditions. For one group of alumni in Atlanta, Ga., this means a Kwanzaa celebration.
On Thursday evening, the Harvard Club of Georgia and the Harvard Black Alumni Society hosted the Kwanzaa Party, an annual alumni event that organizers say is unique to Atlanta.
"Kwanzaa is about making everyone here part of the Harvard family," said Avarita L. Hanson '75, who opened up her home for the event. Hanson said that she sees Kwanzaa as an opportunity to celebrate ancestors and the past, to give thanks, and to enjoy food and fellowship.
Xavier A. Cunningham, president of the Atlanta Chapter of the Harvard Black Alumni Society said that while most other chapters of the Harvard Black Alumni Society host holiday events, he was proud that his chapter had chosen to label its celebration specifically as a Kwanzaa party.
"Every other celebration during the holidays goes back to a European, Christian, or Jewish tradition," Cunningham said. "Kwanzaa is something African Americans own and claim as part of their culture, and we want to maintain this tradition for this subgroup of people within the Harvard alumni community."
Spanning from Dec. 26 to Jan. 1 each year, Kwanzaa devotes each night to one of its seven core principles: unity, self-determination, collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity, and faith. Daily Kwanzaa rituals involve lighting red, green, and black candles in a specific progression and sharing food, drink, and sentiments.
The first Kwanzaa celebrations emerged in 1966 in the wake of the civil rights movement to give Americans of African descent a chance to reflect on their heritage. Scholar and activist Maulana Karenga, the holiday's creator, modeled Kwanzaa after the tradition of African first fruit festivals that celebrated the beginning of each new harvest.
The holiday has a history on campus as well. In 1994, the Black Students Association held its first Kwanzaa celebration, marking the first time the holiday was sponsored by a Harvard undergraduate organization, according to organizers.
