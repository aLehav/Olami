After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mark E. Zuckerberg is working feverishly at his computer—as he often does in “The Social Network,” the much-hyped Facebook origin story—when a website becomes briefly visible on his monitor which at its top reads “Tyler Durden’s Photos.”
An allusion to the iconic antihero that sprang from one of director David Fincher’s other films, 1999’s brilliant “Fight Club,” this fleeting reference is more than just a clever easter egg included for the amusement of eagle-eyed audiences. Rather, it serves as a subtle reminder of exactly who is behind what was once deridingly referred to as “the Facebook movie.”
Fincher has made a career of capturing the intricacies and passions of the human mind in a stylistically captivating, typically bleak manner. A penetrating portrait of the brains behind Facebook, “The Social Network” fits into this oeuvre with one notable—and welcome—addition: hyper-literate screenwriter Aaron Sorkin. Together, Fincher and Sorkin have crafted a stunning modern epic—an electric and incisive film that is a timeless depiction of old against new and one man’s single-minded climb to the top, and yet remains deeply relevant to contemporary society.
Fincher and Sorkin are perhaps not the most obvious pair to tackle the story of Zuckerberg’s rise to Internet ascendancy; but as a rapid-fire conversation about final clubs in a bar gives way to a darkly melancholic sequence of Zuckerberg traveling back to his Kirkland House dorm room, it becomes clear that here is an ideal creative union.
Fate, coincidence, luck—whatever prompted this meeting of artistic minds behind the movie also drives the story of the film itself. Socially awkward, technologically savvy, and profoundly lonely Harvard sophomore Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) sparks a cultural sensation in 2004 when he creates social networking website Facebook after three fellow students—Cameron S.H. Winklevoss ’04, Tyler O.H. Winklevoss ’04, and Divya K. Narendra ’04—ask for his help with a similar project.
While Facebook becomes the phenomenon it is today, Zuckerberg breaks ties with his close friend and business manager Eduardo L. Saverin ’05 (Andrew Garfield), as Saverin can no longer keep up with the company’s growth. In the present day, the Winklevoss twins (both played by Armie Hammer, with body double Josh Pence) and Narendra (Max Minghella) press charges against Zuckerberg for copyright infringement and fraud, while Saverin sues for his role in Facebook being unfairly diminished.
Although the film follows Zuckerberg most closely, he is neither its hero nor its villain. Refreshingly, heroes and villains are nowhere to be found in “The Social Network,” where everyone is at least a little wrong even as they resolutely think they are right. Narendra and the Winklevi, as Zuckerberg refers to the brothers, carelessly engage in the world of excess and exclusivity that so enraptures and yet excludes Zuckerberg. Saverin almost holds back Facebook’s success because of his lack of vision. Zuckerberg himself, of course, allegedly betrays all the rest. Yet, all five individuals stay wholly convinced that their ends are honorable.
These Facebook five are brought to life vividly onscreen. Saverin is ostensibly the most virtuous of the group, but Garfield at times makes him unexpectedly—and fittingly—dark, further clouding the moral lines. Similarly, Hammer and Minghella never let their characters become the rich-kid antagonists a lesser movie might make them out to be. Hammer in particular infuses his depictions with humor and likability, which serves as a biting contrast to the twins’ later embitterment.
Yet above all, this movie belongs to Eisenberg, and his nuanced portrayal of the man behind Facebook stuns. His fast-talking and anxious teenaged Zuckerberg at the beginning of the film believably and subtly turns into the impertinent and nonchalant businessman later shown at the depositions. However, Eisenberg never descends into pure malice; his Zuckerberg might be a pitiful person, but he remains pitiable.
What results from these carefully shaded renderings is an illustration of the nature of truth—specifically, how any one event can yield numerous individual accounts of “what really happened.” The film’s engaging structure, which effortlessly shifts between Facebook’s creation and the later depositions, reinforces these fractured perspectives that touch on everything from loyalty and jealousy to power and status; while grounded in a battle over technology, the film explores countless universal concepts.
The genius of “The Social Network,” though, lies in its specific execution of these weighty ideas. Fincher and Sorkin elevate an already compelling and sensational tale to a grand scale. The techno-operatic score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross forebodingly pulses throughout the movie like a synthesized heartbeat. Sorkin’s writing is characteristically sharp and witty—“I think they want to sell me a Brooks Brothers franchise,” former University President Lawrence H. Summers says of the Winklevi—but also smartly presents the disputes of these college students as epic struggles on the magnitude of a Greek tragedy. Even though anyone with an Internet connection knows roughly how the story ends, Fincher maintains the film’s tension and sense of exhilaration throughout; its continuous momentum mirrors the meteoric rise of Facebook itself.
As for the place where Facebook started that ascent, Harvard fares well with an authentic onscreen representation that captures the general tone of the campus. Sorkin nails Harvard’s unique vernacular, convincingly incorporating references to House life and the broader campus experience, and the actors sound natural using these Harvardisms. Small details, like the advertisement for Drag Night on the Adams House website, help to realistically evoke the world Zuckerberg inhabited. While the door Zuckerberg swipes into to enter Kirkland might not accurately reflect the House’s actual arched brick entrance, his dorm room feels appropriately cramped and seems to be a walk-through in true Kirkland style. Although it is sometimes clear that this is not the real Harvard, it certainly feels like it.
Not quite as credibly portrayed are the final clubs, Harvard’s semi-secret all-male social organizations to which Zuckerberg strives to belong—and which are suggested as a possible reason he starts Facebook. While the groups are indeed exclusive and often throw impressive parties, the pictured debauchery borders on excessive. However, when these scenes are viewed as Zuckerberg’s projections of what he misses out on by not belonging to a club, the film’s veracity stays intact. After all, final clubs are hardly presented as the objective pinnacles of Harvard’s social life; more accurately, only the Zuckerberg of the movie sees them that way.
This obsession—with final clubs, then Facebook, and always status—earns Zuckerberg his place among Fincher’s motley crew of fascinating and manic antiheroes. Tyler Durden is going to have to make room for the new addition to the club—one that Zuckerberg is more than welcome to join.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Harvard University President and current University Professor Lawrence H. Summers will soon return to Harvard from his influential position as Director of the National Economic Council. Weathering criticism of Harvard’s tenure policy, which may have played a role in Summers’s return, the University ought to be applauded for the demonstration of its steadfastness to its policy: Any professors who are away from the University for more than two years must give up their tenure and later reapply for it upon their return, if they wish. By setting strict limits on who is considered tenured faculty, Harvard is simply affirming the academic truth that professors’ foremost obligations are to teach students and be active within the research community.
Harvard’s tenure policy has been under criticism since President Obama emphasized the integral role of Summers’s counsel in avoiding a deeper recession. That Summers may be returning to Harvard in order to keep his tenure, instead of serving the country at a high level, could lead some to believe the policy deserves reexamination.
However, it would be disingenuous for an academic institution devoted to teaching and research to employ a professor who is involved in neither for a significant period of time. Making an exception for Summers would not only create a poor precedent, but would also contradict Harvard’s guiding principles of quality teaching and expansive research.
As such, any speculation on the myriad possible reasons for Summers’s return ought to matter little when one considers that Harvard will benefit enormously from his presence on campus—it has been hinted that Summers will teach at the Harvard Kennedy School.
Harvard is blessed with many former public servants, whose practical backgrounds elevate Harvard from simply an intellectual environment to one that acts in the world. Summers’ influence as a public figure can hardly be overstated, as he helped frame the $787 billion stimulus package and oversaw the bailout of the auto industry. Therefore, it is perhaps equally difficult to overstate Harvard’s gain at retrieving a person of Summers’ experience and expertise.
Nonetheless, there are circumstances in which tenured professors serving a higher cause are unable or unwilling to return within two years. In the hope that public service is not discouraged, the administrators and faculty who reevaluate these professors for tenure upon their return should take into account professors’ contribution to the common welfare.
Furthermore, any recommendations for lengthening the number of years of permissible absence are likely misinterpreting the point of tenure. Tenure is not meant to provide permanent job security for those no longer active at Harvard. It exists to ensure professors of their job security so they can freely speak and conduct research.
With the reasons for his departure from the capital still unclear, Professor Summers extends his reputation for controversy into the new decade. Regardless, what ought to remain decidedly uncontroversial is the University’s laudable tenure policy.

Student uproar reached fever pitch last year when the administration decided to cut hot breakfast from house dining halls. Yet, ask one of the many undergrads en route to their House d-halls for dinner, and few will be able to tell you that over one billion people—one out of every six humans—go hungry every day. Sixty percent of total global mortality is due to malnutrition, and the World Health Organization calls malnutrition the gravest single threat to the world’s public health.
Certainly, mass hunger is hardly a new phenomenon. However, the horrifying reality is that desperate hunger persists despite the tremendous technological advances that have made food cheaper and more readily accessible than ever before. The crisis of the modern era is not one of lack but rather of excess—a crisis of overabundance.
The volcanic ash that temporarily shut down Europe earlier this year brought this supreme irony into painful relief. With flights in and out of the continent grounded, substantial amounts of produce and goods sat in warehouses across Africa and Asia. But because food spoils quickly, companies could not wait to sell overflow inventory when European airspace re-opened. No, the food would be trashed. This juxtaposition of starvation with inordinate amounts of food, not only in the developing world but also in affluent urban metropolises, begs immediate action.
Upending the status quo is, however, hardly as easy as simply shipping food to the poor. First, direct provision of food is only a temporary solution: It is neither sustainable in the long-run nor addresses any of the root causes of the lack of food. Food aid today fails on both of these counts. The U.S. has been criticized by a growing number of advocates who see our policies on food aid as not much more than corporate marketing. Under the current system, the federal government buys the surplus from American agribusiness, ships it overseas on mostly American-flagged carriers, and then donates it to aid groups, who in turn sell on local markets. The E.U. and Japan are similarly guilty, beholden to the politically powerful, multibillion dollar industry lobbies.
Food aid also fails on a second front. The sudden influx of food in developing markets artificially lowers prices—what trade economists call “dumping.” Already struggling farmers, often using agricultural practices that date back millennia, can provide no competition for American taxpayer-subsidized crops and are subsequently driven deeper into poverty. Earlier this year, news outlets reported what developing government officials have been bitterly arguing for years: Haiti wanted food aid to stop, citing the international outpouring of support after the devastating earthquake as interfering with its economy. This information was quietly swept under by donor-sensitive aid agencies.
Finally, food aid is politically corrosive, perpetuating undemocratic regimes, incentivizing corruption, and institutionalizing inefficiency. The brouhaha over aid to Zimbabwe and North Korea, after all, was predicated on preventing the dictatorial Mugabe and Kim regimes from using food as political currency for supporters. Earlier this year, a leaked United Nations Security Council report claimed as much as half of the food aid to Somalia was channeled not to the country’s roughly three million hungry, but to a “web of corrupt contractors, radical Islamist militants, and local United Nations staff members.”
But this is an opportunity for meaningful change. In 2007, the global charity CARE declared it would reject government funding for food aid, citing many of these same problems. Last year, the Obama administration pledged $408 million to a $22 billion fund by wealthy donor countries to boost food production in the developing world. It is past due to reshape and transform the prevailing consensus. Instead of dumping subsidized produce, why not export best practices in farming and technologies for improving crop yields? The new generation of food aid should be contingent on efficacy for the recipient, not reward to the donor—sustainability, not convenience. Next time you place your tray on the dining-hall conveyor belt, don’t just think about how much food you are wasting, but imagine a world where that luxury would be shared by all.

When I tell people I spent the summer teaching in Namibia, their reaction usually is: “Uh, where is that again?”
Since Namibia celebrated 20 years of independence this past March—and has a population of only two million—it is understandable that not too many people know much about it. At times, it was unthinkable being in a country so young that I would have been one year old when it broke free from South Africa’s rule and became a new democratic nation under its first president, Sam Nujoma. Although Namibia is a seemingly inconsequential and often forgotten African nation, many countries have something to learn from its impressive and quick success, and something to gain from its people.
All Namibians know someone who fought in the war for its independence. The fighters, members of the South West Africa People’s Organisation, were known for guerrilla warfare tactics and would ambush South Africa’s soldiers then retreat into bordering Angola. When SWAPO members were exiled, many went abroad to study and then came back to Namibia to help shape the new government, now ruled by the majority SWAPO party. My host mother’s brother went abroad to study architecture in Europe, and he now designs shrines commemorating the freedom struggle in Namibia. One of his shrines is in Eenhana, the town that I taught in for two months.
The shrine, built in 2007 after a mass grave of SWAPO supporters was discovered nearby, commemorates the bodies with two marble slabs and displays a huge statue of a woman fighter. I asked a local man about the significance behind it. He explained that women played a vital role in Namibia’s quest for independence. Women risked their lives to house, feed, and care for soldiers, and some even joined the battles themselves. This fact compliments and perhaps partially explains the progress Namibia is making in gender equality. Gender equity is protected by the constitution, and gender equity laws also promote women’s rights. The minimum legal age for marriage—for both men and women—is 18. The Namibian government actively promotes the equal treatment of women, and it is very common for women to be the breadwinner in many households. My host mother, for instance, is a teacher and supports her husband, seven kids, and three grandchildren while her spouse resides at their village home in the bush. The mayor of Eenhana is a woman, as is the principal at the school where I worked.
Before independence, Namibians were a group of many different tribes, separated by language barriers. The language Namibians were required to learn was Afrikaans (which is now considered a language of status). When Southwest Africa became Namibia, the official language changed to English, and the country made sweeping efforts to ensure its citizens had a command of the language. My host mother, who has been a teacher in Namibia since 1975, went back to university so she could learn English properly and would be able to teach in English.
While the towns below the red line—a line that separates domestic from wild cattle—are more developed and very Western, towns in the north are working toward development. Many northern towns were formed after independence, and the government sets aside a large amount of money toward improvement in education—more than 20 percent of the national budget—in addition to funds for infrastructure and development in these cities. The government also pays for food programs and housing for some of the bushmen, known as the San people.
What impressed me most about this newly formed nation was the strong sense of national pride, uniting all Namibians, black and white, Damara and Herero, Caprivians and Oshiwambos. At every morning assembly, the students at Eenhana Senior Secondary School sang the national anthem with pride as they faced the Namibian flag. Namibians from all parts boast about the safety and friendliness of their country. They asked me if I had seen the beauty of their sand dunes in the south, their popular and massive national park, Etosha, in the north, or their huge waterfall, Ruacana, by the Angola border. They talked about how many Angolans and Zimbabweans come to Namibia in hopes of a more stable future and secure jobs. They wanted to know whether their national celebrities, white pop singer Stefan Ludik and the Oshiwambo rapper, Gazza, are popular in the U.S. as well.
Although I only lived in the country for two short months, I felt its pride and knew I would take a piece of Namibia back with me to the U.S.—in the form of greeting everyone with a smile, making the best out of bad situations, and giving to others what you cannot afford for yourself. In spite of its young age and modest population, those who would argue that the situation of Africa is hopeless need only look as far as Namibia as a model for hope. Although it still has a ways to go before recognizing its full potential, Namibia has made great strides since independence, and is one of the most prosperous and safest countries in Africa today.

To the editors:
Thank you for your timely Sept. 21, 2010 editorial “Beat the Meat.” According to Aramark (a leading food service provider to schools nationwide), one in four college students is actively seeking vegan options when they sit down to eat, and according to Jonathan Safran Foer (a best-selling author who spoke at Harvard last week), 18 percent of college students now identify as vegetarian.
Your article also comes at a point when the American Dietetic Association (the world’s largest organization of food and nutrition professionals) has announced that vegetarian diets are associated with a lower risk of cancer, diabetes, and obesity; at a point when a United Nations report has concluded that a global shift toward a vegan diet is necessary to combat the worst effects of climate change; and at a point when billions of animals are being abused on factory farms in ways that would be illegal if dogs and cats were the victims—such as pigs having their testicles cut off and birds having their sensitive beaks seared off, all without painkiller.
Your thesis that Harvard University Hospitality and Dining Services should educate students about the harmful effects of meat-eating, provide more vegetarian options, and reduce the amount of meat served makes a good deal of sense. But students don’t need to wait for HUHDS to make changes in order to start helping animals, the environment, and themselves. During my time at Harvard, I had fun exploring the creative vegan options HUHDS already serves, like delicious tofu fajitas; hearty black beans, rice, and fried plantains; and the trusty vegan chick’n patties always available at the grill.

To the editors:
Avishai D. Don’s Sept. 23 column, “The Settlers of Canaan,” is morally troubling and belies a deep misunderstanding of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Don argues that if only Israel and the United States were to make the distinction between fundamentalist settlers and non-ideological settlers, then this would go a long way toward resolving the dispute, because it would enable the harnessing of non-ideological settlers in favor of the two-state solution. Further, Don’s solution is that Israel can make the two state solution more palatable to these settlers by granting the Palestinians a state in stages, “over decades,” gradually dismantling settlements.
Contrary to Don’s opinion, the problem is not with the settlers so much as with the settlements themselves. Does it really matter whether the person who is illegally living on Palestinian land is an extreme right-winger or only a moderate right-winger? The mere existence of a settlement impacts the life of the average Palestinian. Palestinians cannot enter settlements without permission. They have to wait hours at checkpoints that surround settlements. They can only travel on some roads in the West Bank, even if these roads were built on expropriated private Palestinian land. Would a Palestinian, waiting in the scorching heat for hours simply for the purpose of getting from her village to a medical clinic, care that the checkpoint is there to secure a non-ideological settlement?
Further, Don writes: “Whether the best way to isolate extremism among Palestinians is to build on the land that they desire for a state is obviously debatable.” One must wonder how the entrenchment and reinforcement of the settlement enterprise, the strongest and most visible symbol of the 43-year-old Israeli occupation, can isolate extremism. The existence and development of the settlements is making the two-state solution less and less of a viable option. Settlements not only gut the West Bank, but pose a significant hardship on the lives of Palestinians. Increasing these hardships and continuing the human rights violations will not isolate extremism, it will only exacerbate it.
And the icing on the cake: Not only have the Palestinians been denied their rights for decades, Don suggests extending that by a few more decades. The Palestinians want, and deserve, their right to self-determination. Continuing Israeli occupation, while simultaneously extending the settlement enterprise, stands in the way of justice both for Palestinians and Israelis. As an Israeli, I reject Don’s suggestion that we wait a few more decades. The conflict has been going on long enough. It is time to end it, not prolong it.

This 50s-style restaurant near the Kendall Square Cinema—whose waiters are less Beat than hipster and whose soundtrack is more OK Go than Elvis—doesn’t just do standard diner fare. The menu spans from Pumpkin Pancakes that taste like Thanksgiving ($5.75 for one), to Sklarmaggedon—eggs with three kinds of meat ($11.75)—to Mr. Haeger, a grilled cheddar sandwich with pickles, tomatoes, and horseradish mayo ($9.25). Make sure to choose the delicious anadama bread to go with your eggs. Finally, complete your order with a Mojito Milkshake ($5.25), Raspberry Cocoa (free whip and marshmallows) ($2.75), or a drink from the dizzying cocktail and beer list. Not only are they open on Sunday mornings to take care of your aching head and bruised dignity, but they also serve until 1 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. And if you need further convincing, The Friendly Toast was named one of the best breakfast places in America by Esquire in 2009.

The Bhangra beats bubbling out onto the street, the spicy olfactory haze that wafts around the shopfront, the huge Boston Globe excerpt stuck to the window that proclaims, “Inman Square Indian Imports Authenticity”—something about this place just screams “legit.” Inside you’ll find a mosh of People’s Republicans scrambling to order one of the 113 offerings on the board—numbered, thankfully, for those of us with a culinary sense of adventure but not a linguistic one. Among the old favorites of (pseudo-) subcontinental cuisine, you’ll meet countless dishes you’ve never heard of and make your pick under the watchful gaze of ten gurus, two elephants, and one of the seven dwarves. For $10.95 plus tax, a special will get you a generous meat or veggie dish with naan, rice, and all the appropriate condiments. Sides and light dishes are around $5, and for $2.50, you can have a traditional lassi, flavored anything from guava to mango to the temptingly vague “salty.” If you can’t finish it, just take it home. Trust us—it beats brain break.

If you’re looking for a new way to satisfy that sweet tooth, head to Sofra for some Eastern Mediterranean delicacies. Inside, ornate fabrics and throw pillows adorn wooden benches where customers sit and drink their coffee at a leisurely pace. According to employee Laura E. Brooks, the customer base “kind of runs the gamut,” and includes many locals from the Eastern Mediterranean. “We have a ton of regulars,” she adds.
Like the décor, the food is exotic and varied, drawing on flavors from throughout the region. For those who don’t know their ma’amoul from their kunefe, the friendly staff is happy to help.
The chocolate hazelnut baklava, a tasty twist on a Turkish classic, is a customer favorite. The delicately spiced pumpkin jam turnover is another good pick, especially for the season. FM also recommends the crunchy sesame cashew bar and the rich, sugar coated earthquake cookie. Together, the four pastries cost $12.50 before tax. In addition to deserts, Sofra also offers an extensive menu that includes breakfast fare, salads, flatbreads, and mezzes.

A national chain that just opened its Boston location in August, Howl at the Moon features a unique entertainment experience: a rock ’n’ roll dueling piano bar. Every Wednesday through Saturday, Howl hosts this piano-off, with the bar’s entertainers taking the stage two at a time and playing the greatest rock ’n’ roll hits from the 70s to today. Players bang the keys for an hour-long set before giving the stage up to the next pair, with performances culminating in a four-way jam session featuring guitar, saxophones, and drums. What’s more, at the end of each hour’s duel, the entire Howl at the Moon staff joins in the show and leads the audience through the “Showtime” routine, which is choreographed to animated versions of popular show tunes (think “The Donkey Show” plus piano, sans Shakespeare). And the best part—it’s free before 9 pm, and for a modest cover of $5 to $10, you can keep on going into the night.

Sometimes the Saturday night Mt. Auburn rat race grows tiresome. Or maybe you’re blacklisted from that rat race. Either way, Central Square’s Enormous Room is a short walk away (or T ride for the morbidly lazy) and offers an entirely new scene. Located above Central Kitchen, the only sign of the club’s existence is a red elephant above the door and the occasional queue leading to it. Flash that ID, pay the $5 cover charge (unpredictably enforced), and climb the stairs to the Enormous Room’s ironically named space. Though intimate, the brick-walled club exudes an eclectic vibe that feels a little West Village. The crowd dancing on the club’s pillow-lined platforms is mixed—not as ancient as many Harvard Square venues, but certainly not as puerile as the Pudding. The inventive mixed drinks pack a punch, but are a tad pricey (most are $10), so consider sticking with the $4 beers if you’re trying to catch up with your fellow patrons. Walk back instead of cabbing it and you can squander the rest of your cash at the Kong.

Located in the somewhat unknown Fort Point neighborhood of Boston’s waterfront, Drink is well worth the trek, but don’t come with a cocktail in mind. Instead, the bartenders will ask what alcohol, flavor, or even ingredient that you’re in the mood for. Whether you’re craving black rum, something spicy, or a cherry, the crafty mixologists shake up a surprise and then explain the concoction as they serve it. The expertise doesn’t come for free—expect to pay about $12 a drink. Bring a group of friends whose germs you don’t mind sharing in order to sample the work of Drink’s master bartenders. And given that this is a Barbara Lynch establishment, pool your extra change to order a couple of the bar’s canapés, such as the steak tartare ($15) or the french fries with malt vinegar aioli ($7).

I knew things were going badly when I began squeezing the blood out of the pancreas glands. I’d bought them for my offal-themed dinner featuring less traditional cuts of animals. Several friends were late—or never ended up showing—but I was still defrosting the beef tripe and manning a pot of braised pork belly.
“I’m failing so hard,” I said to my better half who was obediently stirring the green beans. He said something about being confident in my abilities.
This was all in the name of competition. A food blogger competition sponsored by Foodbuzz. My blog, LingboLi.com, had been cruelly abandoned in the wake of schoolwork and jobs, so I was happy to be coerced into blogging. The third challenge in the competition was to host a “Luxurious Dinner Party” to introduce guests to “new and exotic flavors.” I wasn’t sure how luxurious offal was, but it was surely new and exotic to some of my friends.
“I like offal more than it’s healthy,” my friend Sam admitted. He arrived first, bearing a box of Turkish delight, along with a gift of bacon marmalade. The latter was never going to pass his kosher lips. While he waited, I fed him dry-fried green beans made with ground chicken rather than the traditional pork. Hostess with the mostess—that was me.
The issue happened to be one of planning. Cooking offal, it turned out, is no quick task. These are not naturally delicious cuts of flesh; they have difficult textures and excess bloodiness that lends an irony flavor. They often require a full day of cooking. It wasn’t until 7 p.m. that I realized the tripe was going to need four to five hours in the pot. The guests were arriving soon. I was paying the awful, tripe-scented price of no planning whatsoever. And it smelled nauseating, wafting in a half-frozen chunk in the microwave. I tried to move the plate, but ended up splashing more tripe juice across my dress. The scent rose up again, raw and insistent. The sweetbreads similarly needed a full 24 hours of soaking to remove blood, a poaching, then a pressing to remove more blood. The idea was to turn a pinkish, slippery pancreatic blob into a white blob with a soft, creamy texture. But I had two hours. I ended up abbreviating the soak and pressing. My roommate Felice didn’t know any better and declared it the “best pancreas ever.” I had given it a dip in flour then fried it in butter.
“That was awful,” I corrected her. “It tasted all irony. I didn’t get all the blood out.”
“Well, I’ve never eaten pancreas before,” she said. “So it’s still the best ever.”
I have kind friends.
It wasn’t all bad. The pork belly came out luxuriantly fatty, humming with sweetness and imminent heart attack. I also made risotto croquettes, cheesy with fresh mozzarella and Parmesan, browned in butter and served on a bed of slivered greens. And the jasmine rice stood white and fluffy in its bowl with a sprinkling of sesame seeds. Another friend brought a cabernet sauvignon. Sam broke out his camera and let me take photos. I played some indie rock on Pandora. Magically—and I do mean magically—everyone managed to sit down at the same time with a full table of dishes. It was 9:30 p.m., over an hour late.
So I never defrosted that beef heart in the fridge. And the tripe was still bubbling away on the stove, smelling as offensive as ever. But I was touched at how supportive my friends had been in helping me plate and photograph the offal. Thanks to them, what could’ve just been a life lesson in preparedness when entering competitions also turned out to be a pleasant dinner of pancreas, pork belly, and red wine.

At just $5 to $12 for a student ticket, a show at ImprovBoston is often cheaper than a movie. And you can either choose between one stop on the T, a few stops on the bus, and several minutes on foot, so distance is no object. One of the area’s leading improv theaters, ImprovBoston features different shows every Wednesday through Sunday. Wednesday brings “The Comedy Lab,” Saturdays offer more wholesome fare with “The Family Show,” and once a month you’ll even get the “Naked Comedy Showcase.”  Those who are obsessed with “The Breakfast Club” or just synth-pop and blue eye shadow should check out “John Hughes High” with its ’80s high school theme. Meanwhile, Stewart and Colbert fans might enjoy “MOSAIC,” a political and pop cultural musical featuring such heart wrenching laments as the ballad of the “Republican in Cambridge.” If you feel the performers aren’t doing the material justice (and are willing to spend over $15), the theater also offers classes.

Unimpressed with the five movie options presented at our local AMC Loews theater? Want to escape “The Social Network” for a little while this weekend? Just 20 minutes from the Square you’ll find the Coolidge Corner Theater, Boston’s “Not-For-Profit Independent Theater.” The theater shows a variety of documentaries and classics, as well as foreign and independent films. Originally built as a church in 1906, the building has evolved into an Art Deco temple for film and the arts. Even a movie-goer with the most particular of tastes will find something to love among their offerings, from the “After Midnite” late-night horror flicks to the “Sounds of Silents” program that screens rare silent films. The $9.95 ticket gives you access to a plush red chair inside a massive hall adorned in gold, and the thrill of watching those red velvet curtains slide open.

Most students miss it—the sign outside on the sidewalk outside of the Kong indicating that there’s a nationally-renowned comedy club upstairs, featuring everything from stand-up to improv to professional magicians (and even a few Harvard undergrads in the mix). Thanks to their emphasis on lesser-known (but promising) talent, you very well might be watching tomorrow’s stars for $10 or less. The idea is to stroll in on any of the six nights that they’re open each week (Monday is apparently comedy Sabbath in the Square) and see for yourself what the Studio has lined up. And if you want to be that jerk—you know, the one who heckles the poor new guy trying out some fresh material—you can still order booze and food from downstairs.

If you’re sick of slurred serenades at the Queen’s Head on Thursday nights, but you and your friends still crave some time in the limelight, DoReMi might just be your answer. Hidden away in the Korean district of Allston, DoReMi is the secret gem of Boston’s karaoke enthusiasts. For $7.50 per person per hour, a group of four can rent out an entire private room, furnished with leather couches, a big-screen TV, and a deafening sound system designed to drown out the wailing from adjacent rooms. Though selecting songs can get a little complicated with the Korean remote controls, there is an extensive selection of popular English-language tunes. The establishment also attempts to remain current, so look out for the latest Top 40 updates if you’re in the mood to bust out some Beiber.
Because videos are shadily imported from Asia, many of their Western counterparts may not include 100 percent spot-on lyrics or a corresponding background video. But then again, the whole beauty of karaoke is that if you yell loudly enough into the microphone, no one will ever notice.

Recently, I discovered that I’m allergic to running. Literally. If you’ve ever had a meal with me, you probably know that I’m allergic to some foods, which, for the record, include milk, peanuts, tree nuts (little known fact: coconuts are nuts), soy milk, shellfish, and lotus root.
I also recently found out that I’m not allergic to eggs. This was life-changing. The world of baked goods suddenly was mine. I finally discovered that the hard-boiled eggs I’d been content to peel and poke tasted as delightfully squishy as they felt.
In a lot of ways, it’s like being a little kid—there’s just so much out there to experience! I remember telling my mom right after I found out in ninth grade that I had outgrown my wheat allergy: “I am never, ever going to do drugs. I’m just going to eat fish sticks.”
The other day, I ordered my first HUHDS egg from the grill. I was nervous. It felt like I’d just turned 21, and the bartender was going to confiscate my ID if I messed up the name of a cocktail, revoking the access I’d waited so long to gain. Better stick with something simple but sophisticated–the breakfast food equivalent of a cosmo.
“Over easy,” I hastily scribbled on the form. I knew that was definitely a method of cooking eggs, but I wasn’t quite sure what would end up on my plate.
Of course, if the best part of having allergies is growing out of them, the worst part is gaining new ones.
A few weeks ago I found out that I was allergic to running during the Fast Tracks for Africa 5K. About halfway through, I noticed my skin was really, really warm. And it was kind of hard to breathe.
Then my right eye started watering, which I figured was my body’s bizarre way of telling me I was more out of shape than I thought. When my arms started to itch and my scalp started tingling, I knew I’d hit the last allergic frontier: exercise-induced anaphylaxis, or EIA to those in the know.
Anaphylaxis is a systemic reaction characterized by itching, facial swelling, metallic taste in the mouth, swelling of fingers, hair standing on end, death, prickly sensation on the scalp, difficulty breathing, drop in blood pressure, and finally, shock. Incidentally, symptoms also include “feeling of doom” or “sense that something bad is going to happen.”
No one at school had ever seen me have an allergic reaction, except the blockmate I met when she accompanied me to the hospital on the first day of Dorm Crew after I accidentally ate some cheese-contaminated rice at Felipe’s. My eyes were so puffy that someone asked me if I could still see. I wore my roommate’s super-light prescription glasses for a day and a half to disguise the residual swelling that made my eyes look like they were radically different sizes.
I’ve had my share of severe and often extremely inconvenient allergic reactions. The first time I used an EpiPen—the shot of adrenaline I carry in my purse—I was in Beijing, and I had no idea how to say in Chinese, “No, I’m not dying. Yes, I need to go to a hospital.” A reaction in high school all but sidelined me from a quiz bowl tournament—I stayed in the match, sleepy and incoherent from anti-histamines. I can even have a reaction if I kiss someone who has eaten something I’m allergic to, which adds a whole new dimension of awkward.
But the good thing about being allergic to food is that, the kissing issue aside, I’m not too worried about sneak attacks. I’d always been grateful that I wielded more control over my allergens than did people who were allergic to, say, bees. And who knows? What you think of as the allergy you don’t have, I think of as the allergy you could develop later in life.
Well, I guess bees could happen to me.
One really great thing about life-threatening allergies, though, is that they make everything else a lot less scary by comparison. I’m not afraid of bears, or lightning, or government conspiracies, because a cute little cup of yogurt holds the potential to be just as deadly.
And now, apparently, so does a trip to the gym.

It might’ve been the Puritans thinking that rotund bowling pins and massive balls would promote sloth and excess, but candlepin bowling is just one of those “New England things” that you should try out during your time in Massachusetts. There’s food, beer, and even billiards for those whose competitive spirit can’t be contained to just one game. The atmosphere is charmingly old school, paper-and-pencil scoring and all, but it’s good to keep in mind that the place only has ten lanes. And don’t forget to go easy on the drinks; the families, senior citizens, and Jumbos that frequent Sacco’s are probably just itching to complain about obnoxious Harvard kids. Lanes go for $20 an hour, shoes are $1.50, and strings (the indigenous word for games) are $2.75 during the day and a quarter more in the evenings—a pretty good deal if you have friends willing to try this mutation of a classic American activity.

Cambridge offers a lot, but natural scenery is low on its list of credentials. If you need a change of pace from the bustle of Harvard Square, head to Hammond Pond Reservation. Just under an hour from campus, the reservation is open from sunrise to sunset year-round and accessible to all for no charge. Once there, you can wander the 114 acres—although you’ll need to swim to cover all of them—and explore the miles of pathways through the woods. The sound of wind rustling through the trees and ducks crunching fallen leaves under their feet make for an idyllic escape. In addition to walking and jogging, the reservation is also good for those interested in fishing, hiking, geology, bird watching, and perhaps most notably, superb climbing thanks to some of the most accessible outdoor rock faces around. All you need is your own gear. In the winter, the reservation’s trails can be used for cross-country skiing, which also requires you to bring your own equipment.

Ditch the foreigners, fake Boston accents, and Nikon cameras that are typical of most local tours and head out on your own (partially) self-guided sightseeing: cheap tours of famous local breweries. At the Samuel Adams Brewery, the tours cost nothing and include samplings of freshly brewed beer. When your new best friend behind the tasting counter finally cuts you off, head back to the T and go to South Station, where you can get on the Silver Line 2 bus and slur out a request to be dropped off at Harbor Street, right across from the Harpoon Brewery. Here, $5 will get you a guided tour, a sampling of Harpoon and UFO beers, and your own souvenir glass. When finished, stumble back to the T, ride back to Harvard Square, and step directly into C’est Bon, where you can use the remaining $4.90 of your $15 budget. Remember, it’s not alcoholism if it’s for a tour.

If you’re looking for a quick study break in Boston between the three p-sets that are due tomorrow, the five clubs you chair, and the four classes you attend sporadically, then make a trip to the Mary Baker Eddy Library’s Mapparium. Open Tuesdays through Sundays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., admission with a student ID is only $4, with an additional $1 discount if you present your Charlie Card when purchasing tickets. Although a visit to the library is shorter and less expensive than the ride to and from, the three-story, to-scale glass globe is well-worth the trip. After a brief, patriotic, democracy-promoting audio/visual presentation, you are left to take in the globe yourself, as well as experiment with its acoustics. Stand in the middle of the walkway that passes through the southern hemisphere of vibrant-colored countries, and your voice resonates as if it were being projected in surround-sound. Whisper to friends from the other side of the world and they will hear you perfectly. A visit to this lesser-known Boston destination may only last 20 minutes, but it’s an experience that you are unlikely to find anywhere else.

Boston wouldn’t be Boston without Yastrzemski, Bird, Bobby Orr, and an intense hatred of the Yankees. Considering that more New Englanders could probably tell you who made the final out of the 2004 World Series than what year the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock, the Sports Museum should be seen as Boston’s equivalent of the Louvre in Paris. Located above TD Banknorth Garden—home of the Celtics and Bruins—the exhibits run for a half-mile, highlighting the Sox, Bruins, Celtics, and the Pats. Some more obscure elements of the New England Sports scene are also featured, from high school teams to candlepin bowling, boxing, and bicycle races. Boston sports fans will enjoy some of the museum’s unusual memorabilia, including uniforms, the original Bruin bear cub, Ted Williams’ locker, chairs from the original Boston Garden, and the Beanpot trophy. Check it out and assess the claim that this truly is “the Greatest Sports City in America.” Or think of it this way: $10 for a ticket here is a hell of a lot cheaper than one of the Garden’s premium luxury boxes.

While you may not be able to get fried mayonnaise or meat glue pasta from HUHDS, “Science and Cooking” guest lecturer Wylie Dufresne counts them among his avant-garde culinary repertoire. The chef and owner of wd~50 in New York City talked to FM about his journey from philosophy student to top chef, and why you shouldn’t call him a “molecular gastronomist.”
1. Fifteen Minutes: What similarities do you see between the kitchen and the classroom?
Wylie Dufresne: I think the classroom comes into the kitchen insofar as it takes research and experimentation to understand what happens to food as it’s cooked. There’s been a relationship between the scientific or academic community and the culinary community for a long, long time. We’re trying to exploit that relationship...in the hopes of being better cooks.
2. FM: You’ve spoken out against the term “molecular gastronomy” to describe your cuisine. How would you choose to describe it?
WD: I think that it’s an unfair term, because it’s a term that refers to the work that scientists do. It also doesn’t sound delicious. The term has been so widely used at this point that I think it might be time to just stop fighting it. I don’t think it’s a term that I like—I mean, “modern cuisine,” “contemporary cuisine,” “modern American cuisine” [are] better. The fact that the term is associated with us, and it does bring to mind a certain type of cooking—it serves a purpose. I just think it’s an unfair term.
3. FM:  You mentioned the term “modern American cuisine.” Do you think that this more scientific method of cooking will become the norm?
WD: The method is about education, and I don’t think that education will ever disappear. I think that it’s entirely possible that some of the things that people associate with this type of cooking may come and may go—the foams, the gels, the what have you—those are sort of the sidebar, but what’s behind that is a search for information.
4. FM: You’ve built a reputation on several hard-to-replicate signature dishes, such as fried mayonnaise, slow-poached eggs and meat glue pasta. Did these get you interested in science-based cooking?
WD: I would like to stay away from the term “signature dish”, because it sort of implies that you’re stuck somewhere and you’ve stopped moving forward. We have a dish that’s been on the menu since the day we opened, and it doesn’t mean any less to me than the dish that’s going to go on the menu tomorrow. I like to think that the sum is more than the parts.
5. FM: You have a bachelor’s from Colby. How did that translate into becoming a chef?
WD: Sixteen years of formal education certainly gave me an appreciation for an approach to learning that’s probably not typical of the average kitchen, but more than anything I learned how to learn. I learned how to take information and process it and get the most out of it, and once I found a subject that really spoke to me—I mean, I enjoyed being a philosophy student, but cooking speaks to me more—I had the tools necessary to dive headfirst into it and begin to extract information very effectively.
6. FM: Do you have any advice for students looking to eat better in the dining halls?
WD:  I haven’t been in a college dining hall since I graduated in 1992—that’s a while ago. I think that you can probably still eat pretty well if memory serves. I think it’s just about making good choices. I’m not ready to get up on my soapbox and start talking about meal reform in institutions, but I would imagine that there’s good food to be had. But I’ve never eaten in any of the dining halls at Harvard.
7. FM: When did you decide to become a chef?
WD: I was working a summer job before my senior year of college in Providence, Rhode Island. I was working at Al Forno’s. That summer is a time in one’s life when you’re supposed to decide what you want to be, and I had never really done anything that spoke to me the way that summer experience did. In a perfect world, if I were bigger, faster, stronger, I would have liked to have been a professional athlete. But that was never in the cards, so I gave up that dream. But I realized that there were a lot of similarities between a kitchen and a team. That summer really solidified that for me and that’s when I said, I haven’t felt as excited about anything since I played sports, so I decided that I would give it a shot. And then after I finished my year of college I went to cooking school and never looked back.
8. FM: You’ve worked in several of Jean Georges Vongerichten’s restaurants. Would you count him as a mentor?
WD: Yes, definitely. Early on, Jean Georges had a very deep influence on my style of cooking, and I spent my formative years with him. So he was a mentor, and is a friend to this day.
9. FM: How has your cooking changed since then?
WD: I think I’ve learned more. A lot. I’ve begun to understand the process more, and I think I’ve just begun to find my style and to find the voice of the restaurant. The individual has come out more over the years. Early on all you do is replicate what you know because you’re still in the process of defining who you are. I’ve hopefully moved past that at some point and begun to find my own style.
10. FM: You’ve also participated in a number of extracurricular activities outside of your kitchen—“Top Chef,” “Iron Chef,” “Top Chef Masters”—which of these experiences has been the most rewarding?
WD: I think that they’re all fun. “Iron Chef” is fun because it’s a competition and I like competition. “Top Chef” is fun because it’s also a competition. I’ve been on both sides—both a contestant and a judge, and they’re all good opportunities to expose yourself, to open yourself up to a wider market, to drive people to the restaurant, and that’s good. They allow us to reach people in ways that we wouldn’t be able to reach on our own.
11. FM: How much of your time do you spend actually in the kitchen?
WD:  I spend most of my time in the kitchen; I try to do the administrative stuff in the kitchen as much as possible so I can stay there. I work a 12-hour day here, and I try to be in the kitchen for as much of that as possible.
12. FM: How do you go about creating a new menu item?
WD: Out of a lot of trial and error—which is mostly error or failures—comes a lot of learning and a lot of knowledge. In the process of trying to create something we may never get to that dish on the menu, but we’ll learn a lot along the way, and maybe even a new dish will come out of it. It’s a very organic process where there’s a lot of discussion, a lot of sharing of ideas, and a lot of trial and error. Creativity is not linear; you can’t just sit down and say, “Today I’m going to be creative.”
13. FM: Has this trial-and-error method ever led to any major kitchen calamities?
WD: I don’t know how much you cook, but there are always calamities in the kitchen. There’s lots of high stress, sharp knives, boiling oil. There’s a low-level constant state of calamity—look at the average cook’s hands and arms, and you can see that calamity is around every corner.
14. FM: What’s in your refrigerator at home?
WD: I don’t cook too much at home. It would be nice if I cooked more. I’m sure my wife and child would appreciate that, but as it stands, most of what’s in my refrigerator was put there by my wife.
15. FM: What do you eat on your off days?
WD: It’s more about who I eat with than what I eat. As long as I can eat with my family I can eat just about anything. If I can spend my days off with my wife and daughter, I’ll eat cardboard if I have to.

In the past, learning to navigate without the crutch of modern electronics was essential. This skill has not been lost on the students of Science of the Physical Universe 27: “Primitive Navigation.” For their first assignment, students were asked to walk from the John Harvard statue due West (without a compass) for 20 minutes (without a watch). But the class is no walk in the park. Next week, students will locate the astrophysics building by measuring the angle between themselves and the steeple of Memorial Church. Johnny M. Bassett ’12 described the course as “less classically academic, but more practical” than other classes he has taken.
While "Primitive Navigation" demonstrates how much can be learned by steering physics away from modern technology, Professor Peter D. Manuelian ’81 takes the opposite approach, pairing some of mankind’s earliest great innovations with its recent inventions. Students in Societies of the World 38: “Pyramid Schemes, the Archaeological History of Ancient Egypt” will complete two short iMovies. While Manuelian stresses that the assignment can be as simple as a series of still images, he hopes student will be more daring, and encourages them to submit to the Harvard Shorts Film Festival (which he is running). “Ancient Egypt displays above all things a visual culture: the hieroglyphs, the decorated walls in tombs and temples,” said Manuelian. “I wanted to give the students a chance to dive into that visually rich world, and an iMovie assignment seemed like a great way to begin.”
Professors Doris Sommer and Francesco Erspamer prove that the relationship between art and social action can be as symbiotic as the pairing of ancient and modern. Each week, guest speakers guide students to incorporate art and humanism into professions like law, business, and medicine. Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding 13: “Cultural Agents” guides students to design an “Art Intervention” centered around a social dilemma. In the past, students have designed interventions ranging from perceived residual racism in the classroom to establishing creative writing programs in local homeless shelters. Sommer’s former students have told her that the course “changed their lives” and the way they understood their career paths. “We are all artists,” said Sommer. “We can’t help it, we’re human beings. We make it up as we go along. And if we take that seriously, we’re more passionately engaged in our professional lives.”

Last Thursday, couples boogied on the dance floor to a jazz adaptation of Katy Perry’s “California Gurls” at a restaurant decorated with Rococo-inspired glass chandeliers. The scene was September’s dinner-dance at Upstairs on the Square. One Thursday every month at 9 p.m., the Bo and Bill Winiker Orchestra performs everything from Nat King Cole to the Black Eyed Peas for restaurant-goers.
The Winiker band has been playing at Upstairs on the Square for over three years, ever since Bo Winiker came to the restaurant and fell in love with the place. “It’s just like walking into ‘Alice in Wonderland,’” Bo Winiker said of Upstairs on the Square.
At any given point during the evening, a handful of couples could be seen gliding arm-in-arm across the restaurant’s red floors, spinning past the bar and fellow diners. While most of the dancers were in the older age range, there were a couple of twenty-something-year-old couples, including one that recently got engaged. “I was about 16 when my parents started bringing me here,” said Michelle M. Hogle, the bride-to-be. “I love that they’ve made the time to have live music.”
On each dinner-dance night, the Winiker Orchestra’s music selection is slightly different. “We try to look out and see who’s in the restaurant and play music they grew up with,” explained Bill Winiker.
While many of Thursday’s customers showed up unaware that there would be live music and dancing, a few attend Upstairs’ dinner-dances religiously. “Dancing frees the soul, soothes the soul,” said Larry R. Smith, a dance-night regular. “Plus, it’s very good aerobic exercise.”
Perhaps the most notable aspect of the event was its cheery, whimsical atmosphere. During one of the musical numbers, Jenny Cheng, a customer, leaned over and said with a smile, “I think I caught the chefs dancing in the kitchen.”
The next dance will take place on Oct. 28.

Boston Consulting Group recently claimed the Kendall Square area to be the most innovative square mile in the country. Thus, it was the perfect place for something as techy and adorably nerdy as last Thursday’s Quest for Innovation—a mobile based scavenger hunt. The Quest was done through SCVNGR, a location-based gaming platform that allows users to complete challenges and earn rewards through collecting points. The application currently works only on iPhones and Droids, sidelining those with crackberries.
The event is the brainchild of SCVNGR’s founder and CEO (aka “Chief Ninja”) Seth Priebatsch, a 21-year-old Princeton dropout, and Michael Gaiss, of Highland Capital Partners. Participants included teams from a variety of local businesses and a whole lot of startups scavenging more for networking than points. Strategies varied. Peter Chapin, a member of the hard-hat-wearing, fake-mustache-attired team from Communispace, explained their goal: “Get the most points, and make as few decisions as possible.”
A team from RaceMenu was on the prowl for different kinds of digits. “I personally plan on introducing myself to as many girls as possible. That way, if we don’t win, I’ll have met lots of girls,” explained founder J. Alain Ferry to his team’s dismay. When pressed, he added, “We’re quite active runners, so what we lack in brains, we’ll make up in speed.” Said runners were spotted five minutes into the race casually strolling to their next destination.
As participants trooped to offices and labs, Rob McFeeley, SCVNGR’s Game Genie, revealed his insider advice: “Have fun, keep your head up, and a fake mustache always helps.” Indeed, it did: the mustachioed team from Communispace came in second place, preceded by a team from Babson College. FM, due only of course to some technical difficulties, did not take home the title.

Vast geographical distances may separate Lowell and Pforzheimer, but one thing above all seems to bridge this gap: a shared love of shirtless dudes on calendars.
“I wanted to do something ridiculous, to give the House some ‘exposure,’” said Alex L. G. Hugon ’11, the mastermind behind a plan to raise Lowell’s status on campus with a swimsuit calendar featuring 12 male Lowellians that will be sold for five to ten dollars. He calls his 12-man pack of models the “Belltower Boyz,” after the famed Lowell bells.
What’s in a name? A lot, it turns out. The “Belltower” brand has traditionally been associated with Pforzheimer House’s Moors 410, a notorious party suite located underneath the House’s bell tower. Its 12 senior residents, who had allegedly pondered posing for a calendar way before the Lowellians did, were aghast to find that not only had a group beaten them to the punch, but they had also stolen the “Belltower Boys” moniker, albeit with a “z.”
“Lowell has a bell tower? I thought they only have rats,” said Parker L. Wright ’11, a member of the rival calendar gang.“Lowell is best known for stealing Russian bells and then returning them,” said Adam J. Clark ’11, another swimsuit model and Moors resident.Despite the competitive tensions running high, members of both groups say that their ultimate aim is to help people with the calendars. The Lowell boys intend to donate the proceeds to a local charity, and the Pfoho boys intend to use their calendars to promote safe drinking practices. They also believe that there will be other benefits as well.
“It will make a really good Christmas gift for your mom and grandma,” said Scott M. Elfenbein ’11, another calendar boy from Pfoho.Two groups of 12 dudes, two higher purposes, one name. Can you spell war?
Not so, insisted Hugon. “There is no rivalry. I’ve never even stepped foot in Pfoho!” However, when asked who would emerge victorious in a “calendar pose-off,” he laughed, and perhaps flexed his abdominals a bit. “Is that a serious question?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two Harvard professors and a broadcast journalist explored the impact of uncertainty in science research on public opinion and policy decisions in a panel discussion at the Geological Museum last night.
Moderated by Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean Allan M. Brandt, the panel—comprised of Harvard Kennedy School professor Sheila Jasanoff, biological oceanographer James J. McCarthy, and National Public Radio producer Bruce Gellerman—presented varying perspectives on the amount of scientific evidence necessary as backing for laws and regulations. These issues, they noted, arise in fields ranging from HIV and the public blood supply to observations of ongoing climate change.
“The questions before us tonight are among the most important in global science and policy,” Brandt said.
Jasanoff explained to a packed lecture hall of Harvard students, high school students, and community members that science is moving away from pure observation and describing “how it is” and turning toward the more difficult and uncertain challenges that come with predicting “how it will be.”
As an example, McCarthy described public opinion on climate change as “skeptical,” despite the numerous and renowned scientific organizations that have spoken out about the issue.
Gellerman acknowledged that what he views as a fast-paced, financially motivated news cycle has contributed to the public’s misinformed viewpoints on scientific issues. Describing the media as “guilty as charged” for conveying inaccurate or distorted messages, he criticized the “one and a half line stories that encapsulate a life’s work” as insufficient to adequately inform public opinion.
One attendee, who said he was a chemist, Business School graduate, and climate activist, expressed his own concerns about conflicting opinions between scientists and the public.
“What’s wrong with this situation?” he said, referring to dissenting views on the severity of climate change. “Because when you listen to the scientists, we’re headed for big trouble, and when you talk to the people on the street, it’s just another day.”
The discussion continued after the panel at a reception on the third floor of the Geological Museum, where attendees had the chance to speak with the panelists in a more intimate setting.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Harvard Graduate School of Education alumnus David A. Ticchi reached into his mailbox one day earlier this fall, his fingers brushed over familiar raised dots on an unusual surface.
While it is rare for book or magazine covers to be printed in Braille, the cover of the fall issue of the Ed School magazine, “Ed.,” was specially embossed in the cells of raised dots.
Ticchi—a faculty member at Newton North High School and supervisor of the School-to-Career Program—was featured in the magazine’s cover story, which described the evolution of education for individuals with disabilities in the United States.
Ticchi, who was born legally blind, received his masters and doctoral degrees from the Ed School at a time when accommodations for students with disabilities were still new to the University.
“‘We haven’t had many blind students here, but you let us know what your needs are,’” Ticchi recalled being told by the deans.
Although he grew up two decades before disabled students were protected under the law, Ticchi said he was able to receive an education through the public school system. An economics major in college, Ticchi said he had not planned on becoming a teacher until his former roommate invited him to teach speech and English at a Native American school in Santa Fe.
“I just felt I enjoyed very much teaching and being around young people—just the satisfaction of working with kids and seeing them improve,” Ticchi said.
Forgoing his acceptances to business and law schools, Ticchi then applied to the Ed School—a decision that gave him “opportunity.”
“I just felt totally welcome and supported,” Ticchi said.
Although Ticchi said he “wasn’t out to change the world,” he eventually became one of the first legally blind teachers to be certified in the country.
Earlier this year, when an update from the Ed School that included a discussion on diversity left out the disabled population, Ticchi spoke with Ed School Dean Kathleen McCartney about offering “something constructive” about remembering the disabled.
Months later, Ticchi’s conversation with the dean inspired the “Ed.” magazine story and Braille cover.
The issue’s cover and accompanying story sought not only to capture the changing conversation about diversity in education, but also to debunk the belief that Braille is difficult to learn.
A simple chart inside the magazine helped those who were not literate in Braille to read the word on the cover.
According to Ticchi, as a result of innovations in technologies that facilitate reading—such as audio books—only 10 percent of blind youth are learning Braille.
“If there was one thing that I could change in my education ... I wish I had learned [Braille] earlier,” Ticchi said.
Improving education is ultimately contingent on changing attitudes, he added.
“I just had a lot of self confidence,” Ticchi said. “I just always got what I needed done.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Radcliffe Union of Students teamed up with Quincy Conversations last night to host History Professor Nancy F. Cott to discuss her research on the changing role of marriage as a public institution and her experience as an expert witness in Perry v. Schwarzenegger.
The case treated the legal challenge to Proposition 8, the amendment restricting the definition of marriage to opposite-sex couples in California.
“Cott’s research is important from a feminist perspective because it dismantles the perceptions we have of marriage as a partnership of two people with distinct roles,” said co-president of RUS Shanti S. Kris ’12. “Her research demonstrates that, even in heterosexual marriages, those roles have become much less distinct than they used to be.”
In addition to noting shifts in gender roles, Cott tied the evolving character of marriage to other ongoing social developments such as divorce laws, race relations, and changing definitions of marriage itself.
“These institutions that we so often think are as old as time do change,” said History and Literature Lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy ’93, who moderated the discussion. “The idea that things do and can change goes to the root of the logic, or illogic, of the opposition’s argument that marriage is a timeless institution that has never changed and must continue to never change.”
Cott emphasized the significant changes in the legal and institutional meaning of marriage over the years. She cited changes in legislation around divorce grounds, relative gender roles of men and women within marriage, and the removal of racial restrictions as watershed changes in conceptions of marriage.
“Legislatures over time have changed all these things, so the potential for the change of allowing same-sex couples to marry is certainly within the power of legislatures,” she said.
Relating to her role as an expert witness in the Proposition 8 trial, Cott said that the defending side’s argument was “monotone,” resting its justification of Proposition 8 on the idea that marriage is about procreation and that having one male and one female parent constitutes the best setting for a child to be raised.
“There are lots of ways to poke holes in this argument,” said Cott, noting that there has never been a law requiring couples to be able to reproduce to marry, and that a range of studies have shown that children’s wellbeing is dependent on the quality of care given by parents, not their sexual identities.
She added that above and beyond these arguments, marriage functions as an economic support system and a contract between individuals and the state. With the state’s investment in the institution of marriage, she argued, unmarried people are disfavored no matter who their choice of partner is.
“In the end, the reason I’ve been involved in these cases is that I believe the right to marry the person you love is a civil right,” Cott said.
McCarthy said that Cott’s historical perspective is significant in the trajectory of a pressing social issue.
“This historical context allows activists and those of us involved in the struggle for equality to see we can change these laws and re-imagine them in a way that is more equitable and just,” he said. “It allows us to make stronger arguments, to see the past as constantly changing, and to hope that change can come about in the future.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the heels of an abysmal year for money managers in 2009, university endowment results released in recent weeks show strong investment returns for the year ending June 30, 2010, although different forms of asset allocation have led to significant variations in performance between different schools.
Endowments that invested more heavily in publicly traded assets tended to see stronger returns than those that remained heavily involved in less liquid assets.
Columbia reported the strongest growth among the Ivy League members that have reported results. The school posted a 17.3 percent return that beat internal and market benchmarks and was bolstered by an asset allocation that favored stocks and bonds.
Harvard’s endowment, the largest in higher education, grew by 11.4 percent to $27.4 billion.
“Funds that had more exposure to public equities, to public fixed income have done very well over the last 18 months,” said Michael C. Schlachter, a managing director of Wilshire Associates, a consulting firm that tracks endowment performance. “Those funds that had more allocation to real estate and commodities have done less well.”
Yale, whose 8.9 percent endowment return was the lowest of Ivy League schools that have released figures, has remained committed to real estate and private equity investments that have not recovered as quickly as other sectors of the economy, most notably publicly traded equities.
Only Brown and Princeton have yet to release their financial results.
Since universities’ investment horizons are more long-term than other investors in the market, they have tended to invest more heavily in illiquid assets than other large funds. But during the financial crisis, it became evident that several institutions overloaded their portfolios with such assets, leading to huge losses during the market crash of 2008.
Universities have since begun to restructure their portfolios. Harvard, for example, has moved to increase its cash allocation and has sold portions of its real estate portfolio.
Given the University’s reliance on the endowment, which supplies 38 percent of its operating budget, money managers must provide $1.5 billion in cash each year, according to University President Drew G. Faust. That means Harvard Management Company can not take an entirely long-term view, she said in an interview earlier this month in reference to whether Harvard would consider retooling its investment strategy in the aftermath of the economic downturn.
In her annual report released earlier this month, HMC President and CEO Jane L. Mendillo said that while the University has decreased some of its capital commitments to private equity funds, she had also strengthened relationships with certain managers in the sector.
According to Schlachter, private equity markets represent an opportunity for large institutional investors with connections to top fund managers. After the private equity markets cratered, many large funds have retreated from the asset class and opportunities for good deals—and access to the best managers—abound.
“In 10 or 12 years, people may look back and say those vintage years of 2010 were a fantastic time because there was so much opportunity for skilled managers,” said William F. Jarvis, managing director of the Commonfund Institute, which researches endowments and investment management.

William “Ned” Friedman, an evolutionary biologist from the University of Colorado, will take charge of the Harvard-administered Arnold Arboretum at the end of the semester as the University continues efforts to consolidate its disparate research programs.
Friedman will assume a tenured professorship in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology alongside his role as director of the oldest public North American arboretum—essentially a park used for research in plant sciences.
Provost Steven E. Hyman, who has overseen the University’s concerted effort to build cross-disciplinary and cross-school collaboration, said Friedman’s dual roles will establish a stronger tie between the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the Arboretum.
“Ned’s appointment underscores Harvard’s commitment to integrating the incredible resources and opportunities presented by the Arboretum with the important work of our scientists here in Cambridge,” Hyman wrote in a public statement.
Friedman said that he wants to expand the presence of the Arboretum in undergraduates’ lives, noting that his experience working in a botany lab as an undergraduate at Oberlin College awakened his life-long passion for all things green.
“I had never been that happy,” he said of his experience, adding that working in a lab is “another avenue to discovering what you’re born to do.”
Friedman also said he plans to expand the Arboretum’s programming aimed at local residents.
“We are opening our doors, and we are very eager to welcome people to the arboretum,” said Friedman, adding that he plans to launch a Director’s Lecture Series to make cutting-edge research by leading scientists from Harvard and around the world accessible to the public.
Designed in the 1870s by Frederick Law Olmsted—who also laid out New York City’s Central Park—the Arboretum is part of Boston’s Emerald Necklace along the city’s western edge.
In addition to serving as a center for plant and tree research, the park is also open to the public.
The 265-acre facility, one of several nature reserves in the region administered by the University, has not had a permanent director since Robert E. Cook stepped down in December after 21 years of service.
Friedman will arrive to the state-of-the-art Weld Hill Research and Administration Building, a new facility that will enhance the Arboretum’s botanical research capabilities.
“I’m about as excited as any human being can be about this,” said the botanist. “It really is a dream come true to be placed in an environment where I am surrounded by a world of plants.”
OEB Assistant Professor Charles C. Davis said he is looking forward to Friedman’s arrival.
“He is a dynamic speaker, a gifted teacher, and a very well respected scientist,” Davis said. “He’s the complete package.”

Harvard School of Public Health Professors Norman Daniels and Meredith Rosenthal made light of the partisan debate that preceded last spring’s controversial health care overhaul in a discussion on universal health care last night.
“I support death panels,” Rosenthal said.
“So do I,” Daniels replied.
The discussion, which focused on the health care bill’s structural issues and its ethical implications, was the Harvard College Health Policy Society’s inaugural event this year.
While the conversation—which took place in a half-vacant room in Emerson Hall—was advertised as an opportunity to discuss the bill’s ramifications for students, it evolved into a discussion on its problems.
Rosenthal, who researches the economics of health policy, described how a heated political process inhibited the health care bill’s scope and effectiveness.
She said that one of the bill’s main flaws is its failure to address how health care providers are paid and how health care is delivered. She added that while the legislation builds a foundation for universal health insurance, it still leaves large gaps in coverage.
“This bill is really a beginning and not an end,” Rosenthal said.
Daniels, whose research focuses on the ethical issues of health policy, spoke about the need for universal health care coverage in the United States.
“We live in a very unequal society” that “owes people universal access” to health care, Daniels said.
Though the event was hosted by a College organization, Harvard School of Public Health student Craig White dominated Daniels and Rosenthal’s question-and-answer session with the audience.
White said he was interested in the misinformation among voters on universal health care, which he said fueled anger in the electorate.
“People didn’t know what they were angry about,” he said. “[The bill] really should have gone further.”
The event was especially pertinent at this time because portions of the health care bill went into effect last week, said Vernon Wu ’12, co-executive director of the Health Policy Society.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Harvard Medical School community gathered yesterday to honor the winners of a multidisciplinary competition that challenged participants to solve one of the most pressing questions in the medical field.
“The Challenge,” which had been two years in the making by two Harvard faculty members, asked participants in February to answer the question, “What do we not know to cure type 1 Diabetes?” Harvard students, experts in the field, and even individuals with little to no medical experience submitted answers.
The 12 contest winners included one Harvard undergraduate, six affiliates of the Medical School, a doctoral student at the School of Public Health, and a student from the Harvard-MIT Health Sciences and Technology Program.
The winning responses ranged in focus from type 1 diabetes patient maintenance and care to different approaches to insulin therapy.
Successful contestants, who hailed from diverse professional backgrounds, said that they appreciated the opportunity to have input on a problem outside of their usual areas of focus.
“The fantastic thing about this challenge is that it lowers the barriers to entry so all you really need is an idea and internet access,” said Megan M. Blewett ’11, a winner of the contest. “I think that is quintessentially American.”
The competition based its structure upon crowdsourcing, the concept of opening discussion to a large group rather than restricting it to individual experts.
Robynn Sturm, assistant deputy chief technology officer for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, was in attendance at the Medical School celebration event. She observed that the competition mirrored recent White House efforts to outsource solutions to some of Washington’s most pressing issues.
“{President Obama] called for all hands on deck, recognizing that Washington doesn’t have a monopoly on the best ideas,” Sturm said. “He called for agencies to tap the top talent and expertise wherever they may be.”
The project began two years ago under the direction of co-leaders Eva C. Guinan, HMS associate professor of pediatrics, and Karim R. Lakhani, Harvard Business School assistant professor. The initiative received funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and was supported by research company InnoCentive and Harvard Catalyst, a University-wide enterprise dedicated to tackling health issues.
The competition was designed to test whether the crowdsourcing strategy that had been used in the private sphere could be applied to the academic health care community.
“This is the first time [it] has been in an academic setting,” Lakhani said of crowdsourcing. “Instead of asking for solutions, let’s think of new research hypotheses. Instead of looking for answers, we’re asking more questions.”
Although the competition has ended, the exploration of these questions will continue through significant research grants, including a million dollar grant that has been funded by the Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust. Harvard Catalyst also hopes to solicit research proposals from the academic community after further review of the winning ideas.

Starting this semester, undergraduates and some graduate students will be required to tentatively declare their course schedules for the following semester months before shopping period begins.
Seniors, who have the earliest deadline, will be required to submit their course plan for spring semester classes by Nov. 3 this year. Juniors must submit their tentative schedules by Nov. 10, while freshmen and sophomores submit their course plans Nov. 17.
The schedules, which are completely non-binding, are meant to offer College administrators some guidance in hiring teaching fellows before the semester begins.
“It’s not registration. You’re not in a class," said Stephanie H. Kenen, the associate dean of undergraduate education. "It’s information for planning purposes. We’re not giving faculty the names of the students."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every fall, the media has its annual love affair with football, and action on the gridiron dominates coverage from coast to coast. With men’s soccer opening the year as the highest-ranked fall team, finding gender balance in our sports coverage can be even more difficult. But the women of the Ivy League are fighting back, notching noteworthy accomplishments from the pitch to the track. So gather ’round the water cooler folks, and let’s take a look at what’s happening in the Ivy League this week.
Harvard’s highest honor this week did not go to an athlete at all, but rather to an administrator for a lifetime of devotion to sports. The Crimson’s Patricia Henry, the athletic department’s senior associate director and founder of the Harvard Radcliffe Foundation for Women’s Athletics, received the ECAC Katherine Lay award yesterday for her work over the past 30 years. The award is reserved for “someone of demonstrated leadership ability, a proponent of women's issues, and a role model for women coaches and administrators.” Henry’s inspirational work has paved the way for many of Harvard’s female athletes and those all across the country.
And perhaps this effect is best demonstrated by the number of up-and-coming programs in the Ivy League, like the women’s golf team at Dartmouth. Although the young squad has a ways to go before it finds itself among the Ancient Eight elite on the links, the team did post its lowest round ever en route to a team-record 979 over the weekend at the Yale Invitational. Freshman Sarah Knapp led the way for the Big Green with a 26th-place finish, but Dartmouth finished ninth overall and last among the four Ivy schools in attendance.
Rookies have made an impact on a few more successful teams as well, including freshman Hannah Balleza of the Cornell field hockey team. The first-year attack powered the Big Red to a 3-2 double-overtime victory over Columbia last Friday, keeping Cornell undefeated in conference play. Balleza tallied a goal and an assist against the Lions, placing her second on the team in both categories. Her four goals have come on just 10 shots this season, and this efficient style of play is a big reason why the squad is 5-2 to start the season.
Columbia shouldn’t feel too bad about dropping the overtime heartbreaker, though. After all, one of the Lion’s alumnae just earned a chance to perform on a much bigger stage: the 2012 Olympics. Lisa Stublic, a 2005 Columbia graduate, placed ninth in her first-ever marathon, crossing the line in Berlin with a time of 2:33.42. Stublic, who will represent Croatia at the games, eclipsed the Olympic “A” cut by three seconds while shattering her country’s mark by nearly six minutes. While Stublic is new to the marathon distance, she was no stranger to dominance in the Ivy League, where she recorded one of the 10 fastest times ever (17:10) at the Heptagonal Cross-Country Championships during her senior season with the Lions.

Winning football games is undoubtedly a product of practice, discipline, scouting, and skill, but after traveling to Brown for the game last weekend, I have a new appreciation for another powerful contributor to strong play: fandom.  Under the temporary lights of Brown Stadium, 17,360 fans filled the seats, creating an atmosphere that felt very collegiatea—a rare feat in Ivy League athletics.
“I can’t tell you what it meant to have so many people in the stands,” Bears coach Phil Estes said. “To turn around and see what we saw...[It] really got the adrenaline going, and I think the team fed off of that.”
Brown certainly responded to the enthusiasm of its fan base, which, besides heckling Harvard, stood behind its own for touchdowns, for sacks, and for mistakes. The 29-14 drubbing came not only from the athletes, but also from their extended team in the stadium seats.
Perhaps this should be a wakeup call to the Harvard community to do our part in helping our own teams to victory. The impact is perceptible if not profound, and when the Crimson wins, we all win.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Once, at a party a few years back, I polished off a drink and began searching for a beverage to replenish my Solo. I didn’t have to look very far as, across the room, I spotted a glowing bottle of vodka. It was radiating a Pikachu-yellow, and (like the Double Rainbow Guy) I wondered, “What does this mean?” Pulled into its vodka tractor beam, I walked over to the magical liquid and examined it more closely. It appeared to be a high-quality brand of alcohol which, when exposed to a black light, shone like a jar of fireflies.
“Must have some tasty vitamins,” I figured, pouring myself a splash. I went bottoms-up with my Solo.
Immediately, before I even knew what evil had deflowered my taste buds, I spit the whole mouthful out in a fluorescent cloud. Forensics revealed it was a mix of highlighter fluid and rubbing alcohol which, when combined with a black light at a party, makes a very tasteful, though poor-tasting, decoration.
This story has everything to do with Harvard football. In Week 1, the Crimson looked like the 1920 Rose Bowl champions. Harvard dominated Holy Cross in every phase of the game—offense, defense, special teams, and even crowd attendance. The Crimson sparkled like the luminous potion in that crowded dorm room.
But in Week 2, once we got a taste of Ivy League football, Harvard proved to be demonstrably worse than its first impression. Brown, which was picked to finish below Harvard in the preseason, thoroughly dismantled the Crimson, running up a 23-0 lead to start the game and winning easily, 29-14. This stunning turnaround left many people scratching their heads, and more than a few times I’ve been asked, “So does that mean Harvard’s championship dreams are over?”
The answer is, “No.”
To go back to my little allegory: after I spit out the highlighter cocktail, I raced to the bathroom sink and tongued the innocence out of the faucet. A few minutes later, I was back on the dance floor as if the whole thing had never happened.
The Crimson has a similar chance to right the ship. This weekend, it travels to Easton, Pa., to face Lafayette in a non-conference matchup. The Leopards are winless so far this year with losses (albeit narrow ones) to both Penn and Princeton. This game gives Harvard exactly what it needs: an opportunity to work out the kinks before rejoining the chase for the Ivy League title. One loss has not put the crown out of the Crimson’s reach, but two certainly might.
ALBANY (1-2, 0-1 NEC) at YALE (2-0, 1-0 Ivy)
After lighting up Georgetown to the tune of 45 points in its first game, the Bulldog offense continued to roll last weekend in a 21-7 win over Cornell. Junior running back Alex Thomas’ 107.0 yards per game average is best in the league by almost 30 yards, and junior quarterback Patrick Witt is tops among Ivy signal-callers in passing yards per game with 319.5.
Since its 3-0 pillow-fight against Maine, Albany has dropped two straight and been outscored, 87-31. Yale should roll over the Great Danes before facing Dartmouth next week.
Pick: Yale 30, Albany 13.
BROWN (2-0, 1-0 Ivy) at RHODE ISLAND (1-2, 1-0 CAA)
The Bears defense was beyond impressive last weekend as it held Harvard’s offense to -16 rushing yards and 112 total yards. Yet, its offense struggled at times. Brown settled for six field goals of which freshman kicker Alexander Norocea hit five. The Bears can’t rely on a young kicker for scoring for very long before it catches up to them.
Though URI dropped its first two games, it rallied hard last week in its conference-opener against then-No. 8 UNH. With the Rams trailing, 25-21, late in the fourth quarter, senior defensive end Victor Adesanya sacked Wildcat quarterback R.J. Toman, forcing a fumble that was scooped up by freshman defensive lineman James Timmins and returned 39 yards for the winning score.
Although both teams are coming off emotional victories, Brown will not be able to feed of the energy of a sell-out crowd as it did last week. I’m penciling in URI for the win.
Pick: URI 20, Brown 10.
CORNELL (0-2, 0-1 Ivy) at BUCKNELL (0-3, 0-0 Patriot)
The battle of the ’nells, at least one of which will earn its first, and perhaps only, win of the season. Who will it be?
Cornell, the least productive offense in the Ivies, has put up only 14 points in its two games and allowed 62. Bucknell, which led Dartmouth, 20-9, at the half before allowing 34 unanswered points, has at least been competitive in each game. I’ll give the edge to the home team.
Pick: Bucknell 17, Cornell 7.
DARTMOUTH (2-0, 0-0 Ivy) at PENN (1-1, 0-0 Ivy)
When I saw the Big Green’s record, I asked out loud, “When did Dartmouth get good?” But after a little research, I found out they beat down Sucknell and barely survived Sacred Fart. I’m not impressed.
The Quakers, on the other hand, have beaten Lafayette and, last week, took No. 1 Villanova down to the wire before falling, 22-10. Penn is knocking at the doorstep of the Top-25 and should climb into the rankings next week after it takes care of the Big Green.
Pick: Penn 24, Dartmouth 10.
PRINCETON (1-1, 0-0 Ivy) at COLUMBIA (1-1, 0-0 Ivy)
In the animal kingdom, I’m inclined to believe that a lion would beat a tiger, but not on the gridiron.
Columbia beat a not-very-talented Towson team last week after falling to Fordham in the opener.  The Lions, which sit in the middle of the league in almost every statistical category, are remarkably average.
Princeton could very well be 0-2. Last week, it took the Tigers two overtimes to dispose of Lafayette and escape with a 36-33 win. But Princeton has the most prolific quarterback-wide receiver combo in the league with junior passer Tommy Wornham and senior wide out Trey Peacock. I expect the duo will carve up the Columbia defense and lead the Tigers to victory.
Pick: Princeton 28, Columbia 17.
HARVARD (1-1, 0-1 Ivy) at LAFAYETTE (0-3, 0-1 Patriot)
Last year, the Leopards destroyed the Crimson, 35-18, in Harvard’s most lopsided loss. This year, Lafayette finds itself in dire circumstances; another defeat and the season might spiral out of control. Already, the Leopards lost 19-14 to a very good Penn team and 36-33 (2 OT) to Princeton, so this game will provide a good barometer for the Crimson’s position in the Ivy League hierarchy.
Harvard needs this game to recover some of its swagger. The game has no direct bearing on the Ivy League race, but it could determine the direction of the team for the rest of the Crimson’s season. Harvard has won eight of the last nine meetings, so I’m giving them a slim edge.
Pick: Harvard 14, Lafayette 10.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the final buzzer sounded, Brian Rogers lay on the field, frustrated and cramped.
The sophomore’s postgame reaction said all that needed to be said of his struggling team’s performance in a 2-1 loss to Providence (5-2-1) last night at Soldiers Field Soccer Stadium.
Rogers did all that he could to try to push the Crimson–winless in six straight contests as it heads into conference play–over the hump.  He took eight shots, three directly on goal.  But each time his attempts were denied, leaving him and his teammates wondering where the team that was No. 6 in the national rankings as recently as 10 days ago had gone.
“This game is a true disappointment in the sense that I thought we had better soccer players on the field than our opponent,” Harvard coach Carl Junot said.
The first half of the game was filled with great looks but missed opportunities for the Crimson (2-3-3).
First, at the 6:41 mark of the opening period, junior midfielder Ben Tsuda had an opportunity on a one-on-one with Friar defender David Datilus, who blocked the ball before Tsuda could get a shot on net.
At 7:21, Rogers had a great chance off a rebound on a corner kick, but Providence goalie Jhojan Obando made a diving stop to his left to knock it away.
At 21:33, sophomore defender Richard Smith hit Rogers with a long pass that Rogers windmill-kicked right on goal, but Obando made another impressive save, diving to his left.
Eight minutes later, Rogers once again had a scoring opportunity off a cross, but his attempt was blocked.  Smith had a chance on a header with four minutes remaining in the half that Obando caught with a leaping save, and senior defenseman Jaren LaGreca had an open shot from inside the box that Obando dove the wrong way on, but the ball sailed high and wide.
“I thought that we were starting to do well in the first half,” Rogers said. “It was encouraging.”
Though the Friars were outshot in the period, 12-4, the team took advantage of the chances that they did have.
At 35:11, after a scrum inside Harvard’s 18-yard box, the Crimson had the chance to pick the ball up and clear but couldn’t. Providence midfielder Keith Jecewiz took advantage, gaining possession and rolling the ball past Harvard junior goalie Austin Harms from 15 yards out to give his team a 1-0 lead.
“Off the clearance the ball was bouncing around, and [sophomore midfielder] Scotty Prozeller managed to get control of the ball,” Junot said. “Generally he’s rock solid on decisions, but the ball got caught under his foot, and he turned it over.”
Later, Jecewiz took a pass and sent a cross to teammate Matt Marcin, who from 12 yards out blasted the ball into the roof of the net with just two seconds remaining in the half, putting the Friars up 2-0 at the midpoint.
“[Harms] made some important mistakes,” Junot said. “I thought both goals that beat him were legitimate, quality goals...But that being said, when your defense gives up goals consistently then potentially as the goalkeeper you can ask yourself, can you provide more leadership and can you organize your defense a little bit better.”
The Crimson struck right back under two minutes into the second half when, after a free kick, junior midfielder Jamie Rees took a rebound of a Rogers shot in front of the net and put it past Obando for his first goal of the season.
“We talked about our set pieces where someone just tries to get it across goal,” Rogers said. “So I took it down off my set and hit it as hard as I could across goal, and Rees was there to tap it in.”
But unlike in the first half, Harvard was unable to generate many quality chances the rest of the way.  With 3:52 remaining in the game, Rogers had a shot attempt off a cross that sailed high. It was the Crimson’s best opportunity to tie the score.
“It was a disappointment,” said Rogers, who fought through a quad strain suffered in the second half that limited his performance. “I thought we had a lot of momentum after the goal at the beginning of the second half, but we weren’t able to get that second one.”
Obando finished with five saves on the contest, and Harms tallied two. The loss ended Harvard’s seven-game winning streak against Providence, despite marking just the second time in the team’s last six contests that it outshot its opponent.
“In the second half we came out, made some adjustments from the back which shored up our line and looking at the stats, we only allowed four shots,” Junot said. “[But] it’s not the number of shots. It’s the quality opportunities, and they took care of theirs.”

An earlier verison of the Sept. 20 sports article "Crimson Drops Game to Friars" incorrectly referred to Harvard goalie Austin Harms as a sophomore. In fact, he is a junior.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For some teams, changing leadership in the middle of the year could rock the boat. But for Harvard, it’s been only smooth sailing.
In the spring, both sailing programs witnessed a change in captaincy—junior Emily Lambert took over along with senior Teddy Himler as Liz Powers ’10 and current senior Alan Palmer stepped down.
“Teddy’s great. I mean it’s interesting, because I figured I could do leadership and organization without the title of captain,” Palmer said. “Teddy is pretty good at doing motivational speeches. It’s a great quality of his. In terms of sailing, he’s also exceptional as well. He understands the sport.”
Himler was quick to compliment the leadership of the senior class.
“Our top three male skippers, Palmer, [senior John] Stokes, and me called ourselves the Mighty Ducks when we came in,” he said. “We were these young guns freshman and sophomore year, and we took control as juniors. We’ve also been helped by the other seniors on the team, Quincy Bock and Meghan Wareham. That group of five has really helped and led by example. While, yes, I’m captain, those other four have provided an incredible example for the rest of the team. They made the transition easy for me.”
Similarly, Lambert has felt the change to be smooth.
“It’s been a bit of a transition, but it hasn’t been too much of a challenge,” she said. “The biggest thing is just making sure I set a good example. I really have to discipline myself to be early to practice and make sure I get out on the water early.”
The changes have not bothered the Crimson a bit as the squad continues to roll, aiming to further improve the prestige of Harvard sailing. In 2003, the Crimson won the Intercollegiate Sailing Association National Championships, a coed competition, and in 2005, the women’s team captured the national title. The coed squad placed second in last spring’s national regatta, with the women taking seventh.
Harvard is led by long-established head coach Michael O’Connor, who has been at the helm of the program since 1997. The team’s two new captains have high hopes of repeating the successes which O’Connor has enjoyed with his past teams, as Lambert and Himler look to return the Crimson to the top of the national heap.
“Teddy and I have been really working to try and lead the team by example, whether that’s coming early to practice and being the first boat on the water, making sure all the boats are put away, or trying something new in practice,” Lambert said.
“We’re off to a really good start. We’re at the top of the performance rankings—how you do in the top regatta each weekend,” Palmer added. “Those are important for scheduling.”
While its championship hopes are ambitious, the team’s performance in winning the Hood Trophy last weekend shows this goal could be in reach.
“The competition will be tough to beat,” Palmer said. “But we can do it.”
The coed team defeated 19 schools, including host Tufts, with Palmer and Bock finishing second in the A division. The women also performed well, finishing ninth overall at the Women’s Regis Bowl at Boston University.
With multiple regattas every weekend through both the fall and spring, the competitive sailing season is longer than almost any other sport.
“It’s definitely a grind,” Himler said. “We practice three days a week for about four hours a day. That type of repetition really helps us hone our skills. This gives the team a great sense of camaraderie. The kind of schedule we have wears away at us after a while, but our team is pretty supportive of each other, so it makes us pretty close.”
This year’s squad features many freshmen, with six new men and a whopping 17 new women.
“We have a lot of good freshmen on the team,” Palmer said. “Some of them don’t have great experience, but we’ve had All-Americans on the team before who have never even sailed [prior to] college. People learn pretty quickly if they’re working hard.”
So far, the new captains have provided strong leadership and first-place finishes. Now that they’ve gotten their feet wet, they can set their sights higher—on bringing a national title back to Cambridge.

There are some types balls that benefit from being kicked, and some that don’t. The sOccket is an example of a ball that profits from all that knocking around.
Not your usual ball, the sOccket is a soccer ball that, after only fifteen minutes of play, can provide up to three hours of LED light. Simply put, the balls are fitted with a mechanism that allows kinetic energy to be turned into electricity.
This new invention is the brainchild of four Harvard graduates who came up with the idea while taking an engineering class together as undergraduates. All four women, Jessica O. Matthews `10, Jessica S. Lin `09, Hemali A. Thakkar `11, and Julia C. Silverman `10, had spent time in Africa and became connected through their common desire to make a difference, according to Popular Mechanics.
The magazine recently named the invention one of their Breakthrough 2010 winners, awarding it the “Next generation” distinction.
In most African countries 95 percent of the population lives without access to electricity, according to sOccket's website.
The hope is that these soccer balls, which are only five ounces heavier than regular balls, will help lower that percentage.
On Oct. 7, from 8:30 to 11:30 p.m., you’ll have a chance to see these balls in action. The Laboratory at Harvard is putting on an event in the Northwest Building that will feature the sOccket, along with other attractions, including the tasting of gaseous hors d’oeuvres.
The Lab at Harvard website advises that guests come “prepared to play soccer,” so find some balls to practice on, channel your inner Beckham, and perfect your kick.

Looking for a new (and productive) hobby? Although Harvard students may find they come few and far between, a campus knitting club is allowing some to pursue a new pastime while simultaneously helping charitable causes.
A Stitch in Time—which was recently revitalized by co-presidents Yvette Ramirez '12 and Lily E. Higgins '12—teaches and fosters knitting among students by providing supplies and instructions to club members. ASIT also connects club members with charity organizations in need of hand-knit donations. Currently, the club works with Friends of Boston’s Homeless, Cradles to Crayons, the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, and the Blum Cancer Resource Room at MGH, and is working to expand its donation network, according to Ramirez.
Although ASIT still emphases the charity aspect of knitting, the club has changed its focus somewhat. "Initially...knitters went to women’s shelters and taught them how to knit, but eventually directors there established their own programs," Ramirez said. She added that she "had to change the mission of the group" in order to increase appeal for new members.
"Now we’re trying to encourage more students to learn how to knit, in the hopes that they will contribute some of their hand-knit items to local charities," Ramirez said.
Charitable causes aside, the act of knitting has also proved to be a worthy diversion for some students. "It's just very relaxing to knit," said Shaliesha K. Hinds '13, who has completed more than 10 projects since joining last semester. "It rejuvenates me."
The club meets every other Saturday from 3-4 p.m. in the Women’s Center. But the setting is not intended to deter any craft-minded males from attending. "Guys shouldn’t ever feel intimidated to come join us," said Ramirez. "Everyone's welcome."

For some of you (especially those from the Northeast), that  marshmallow substance called "fluff" is nothing unusual.  If you're  partial to the stuff, you may have even heard of the "What the Fluff" festival, which takes place every year in Somerville's Union Square—birthplace of the famous fluff. 
If you (like a few of our own correspondents) have no idea what we're talking about, read up on fluff here.  Then check out our photos of this year's festival from last Saturday.

According to an e-mail sent by House administrators today, all 13 dining halls, including Dudley House, will remain open over Columbus Day weekend.
The notice sent to House administrators was the following:
“After receiving indications that more students than originally believed will remain in residence during the Columbus Day holiday weekend, today Harvard College asked Harvard University Hospitality & Dining Services (HUHDS) to maintain full service, in all 13 dining halls during that period. This decision will also help provide both the College and HUHDS with two years of data, under the new academic calendar, which will offer a better indication of student participation during this time. Decisions regarding reduced service over future holiday periods will take these data into account.”
Originally, HUHDS had decided to close Currier, Dunster, Kirkland, and Winthrop, but disgruntled students made their voices heard by signing a petition. 88 students signed the petition online, and 90 signed it in print.
