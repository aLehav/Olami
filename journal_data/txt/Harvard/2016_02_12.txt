After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lilliet Berne is a mysteriously gorgeous soprano opera singer. Her vocal range is described as a Falcon—deceptively disguised as a mezzo, but unexpectedly hiding the ability to reach the highest notes with delicate tragic beauty. Like its protagonist, Alexander Chee’s novel “The Queen of the Night” contains endless hidden heights of intrigue and surprise. What initially seem like clichés set the scene for the novel, and yet every turn twists unexpectedly to yield a satisfying unforeseen development or result. Indeed, Satisfying is perhaps the one word that can best describe Chee’s novel. Chee composes an indulgent world of music and magic, prostitutes and nobles, in a novel that is not so much a novel as it is an immersive performance that lingers in the imagination even after it has ended.
Envied by all, swathed in luxury and worshipped by innumerable masses of fans and suitors, Lilliet Berne is at her height of fame and wealth in high Parisian society when the sudden uncovering of her secret past ambushes her. The premise of the plot may seem predictable: A beautiful and famous female celebrity, surrounded by persistent suitors and the glamor of ball gowns and dances, harbors a mysterious past. However, each time the plot seems to fall comfortably into a foreseeable outcome, Chee brings in a surprise that raises the suspense ever higher. Chee seems to know and give exactly what the reader really wants to see even if they may not even know it yet.
Thematically, the performance never ends. Lilliet plays a role both onstage and off, and the book itself, about opera and show, presents a staged spectacle. The blurred lines of performance and reality draw the reader into the same complicated and suspenseful world of truth and lies that Lilliet inhabits. “I was their creature, Lilliet Berne…the Falcon soprano whose voice was so delicate it was rumored she endangered it even by speaking…, said to turn arias into spells, hymns into love songs, simple requests into commands.…The details of my roles had become the only details of my life,” she muses of her exaggerated public image. Lilliet has had to perform in all aspects of her life in order to survive—and as such, the book is essentially one long, mesmerizing show by Lilliet for the reader.
Chee also does not fail to address the role of gender in Lilliet’s sink-or-swim society. Although a dazzling spectacle after she achieves her success, Lilliet’s life is far from glamorous for most of her journey to the top. Her gender disadvantages her in many ways and forces her to learn to be soft and submissive on the outside while remaining tough and resilient within. She learns to gain whatever control a woman can in a world dominated by men. “Men often complain of the wickedness of women. Of how we delight in what power we have over their hearts. But they reign over everything else, so of course, they grudge us this, should we ever come to rule over this thing the size of their fist,” she later notes. Chee achieves a satisfying balance in his characterization of Lilliet, portraying her strength as a woman and her use of her sexuality without demonizing her as a femme fatale.
If the thrill of the plot and the themes of performance and gender were not already stunning enough, the sheer beauty of Chee’s language is surely ample reason to enjoy his novel. Chee creates an almost dreamlike quality, drawing the reader into Lilliet’s head, seeing the world through her eyes. He omits quotation marks for dialogue, so the text feels like a stream of thought or observation. The story flows along at an engaging pace, occasionally slowing, but the action never stops. Chee’s prose itself is often poetic. On grief, he writes, “Why is it so loud when you cry from grief? Because it must be loud enough for the missing one to hear, though it never can be. Loud enough to scale the sky and the backs of angels, or to fall through the earth to where they come to rest.” Chee precisely captures nuances of feeling that bring his text to life: After Lilliet encounters a former lover she longs to escape, she “looked down at his naked body and the unexpected, even extraordinary beauty of it. Why was I not used to it? But, of course, each time I saw it, I sought to forget it, and so each time it was new.”
The experience of reading “The Queen of the Night” is like watching a movie or play, as the story is smoothly laid before the reader’s eyes. The novel flows effortlessly, integrating history just enough for the setting the feel real and grounded, but involving so much fantasy that it sweeps the reader into a world of excitement, wonder, and artistic beauty at every turn. Five hundred plus pages fly by in an immersive flurry. The spectacle of “The Queen of the Night” is magical and indulgent and never fails to satisfy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sixty-two minutes. That’s how long it takes to get to Flint from my affluently ordinary suburb. 
Flint is far away, a place no one from my town would drive to or through willingly. I’ve never even been there, the same way many of my metro-Detroit friends have never been to Detroit. The only story I have is my high school English teacher’s distressed retelling of how she got lost in its empty streets, late at night, crying to her Dad through the phone. The story focused on her. The wasting city, crimes, angels, and graffiti were only a backdrop. They would remain that way.
So when Flint appeared in little blue letters on Facebook’s “trending” section, my cursor sprinted over to see what was wrong. For something to have successfully bubbled out of Flint’s deep pit of problems meant disaster. But... water? My Great Lakes State had messed up water? The situation was so awfully absurd, I almost laughed about lead poisoning.
I suppose it isn’t surprising that my first reaction was inhuman. I had been trained to draw chasms of disregard for the “problem areas” to be “stay away”ed from all my life. Stories of murder, joblessness, gang violence, homelessness, and robbery were perfectly acceptable—as long as they came from the Eight Mile side. But water. This was something basic enough for us suburbians to actually care about. Maybe.
In the following weeks, it was strange, almost uncomfortable to witness a rupture of national concern over this 22-month old “Flint thing.” Nonprofits, Icelandic Water, Walmart, Hillary Clinton, senators, Cher, Eminem, Beyonce, and even Canada stepped in, lending their resources, energy, money, and publicity to bandage the cracks of what felt eerily like my area’s crisis. Despite how obviously criminal the situation was and my own clear relationship, I couldn’t process concern into my concept of Flint, the place normalcy tells me and my family to ignore. When I mentioned the situation to my dad over the phone, he gave a simple “Yes, it’s very awful over there,” and moved on. My mom didn’t even know.
But we are not unique. Abstraction is an expensive game that many suburban Detroiters have long played to prevent moral guilt from upsetting our unequal coexistences. Governor Richard D. Snyder, the overseer undoubtedly responsible for this prioritization of financial plans over basic safety, is simply one of us. The complaints from as early as May 2014 didn’t register because Flint’s existence didn’t register. Even the Environmental Protection Agency failed to comprehend the consequences of the high lead levels it found, letting us take our time with making amends while the poisonous water remained.
Come the next morning, I am once again eating my Annenberg breakfast empty-minded. Three weeks have passed since the media spike, and Flint is already in the far, dark corner of my mind. I smile when my friend sits down and tell her about how I had just lost my tenth water bottle (typical morning conversations). She lights up: “Come buy a water bottle from my club next week! We’re selling them to raise money for Flint, because water bottles, you know, water’s important.”
What? Flint? A long moment of logical silence ensued. Finally, the continued depravity of the situation registers, but it takes far too long, giving time for guilt’s cold hands to latch on. How? How is everyone everywhere so fixated on Flint’s lead-filled water when we—the people surrounding it—continue to make choices for Flint’s damnation? I have no trouble visualizing police brutality or Syrian refugees or lack of clean water in South Asia. Why then, am I unable to imagine a crisis that should be close and dear to me? What does this say about who I am? What does this mean for the suburbanites who don’t care?
I’ll buy one of the water bottles. But when I do, I don’t know if it will be in the name of Michigan or Harvard. When Flint is 11 hours away, I am far enough away to see the atrocity. I become irresponsible enough to want to correct their (our) mistake. And I will help because it is obvious that Flint’s neighbors won’t. I wish I could say this ability to heal, rally, fundraise, and care is something my neighbors uniquely lack. Yet it isn’t. Even here, on this liberal campus, we are comfortable with letting neighborhoods like Dorchester or Roxbury suffer high levels of poverty and crime. They are our Flint. They are our normal, our unfixable. And like any superior neighbor, we try "our best" before covering the complicated depths with shadows and cloaks.
The truth is, we have crises not because they are unavoidable, but because when we are too close and too influential, we are also too tired and entangled. We don’t want to recognize all the ways we are responsible. We see no point in devoting our busy lives to news so old and cold. In the micro, we see the nuances that make things impossible. So we ignore, and don’t let ourselves know just how wrong we are.

Freshman seminars are an integral part of many Harvard students’ first years, and the enrollment levels continue to reflect as much. Last week, Director of Freshman Seminars Ofrit Liviatan said that freshman seminars have received “unprecedented demand” this academic year, with the total number of applications rising to 43 percent and more than 2,100 freshmen applying.
This is a promising trend. The range of seminar choices allows students entering the College to explore their academic passions and curiosities in an environment that encourages academic exploration between freshmen and a professor. A seminar's 12-student cap allows for ample personal interaction with sought-after professors. Law School professor Richard H. Fallon, for example, teaches a freshman seminar about the Supreme Court's history in addition to his popular and significantly larger "American Constitutional Law" course. The satisfactory-unsatisfactory grading system lets students learn for purely the sake of intellectual growth, while the low-stress environment helps ease their transition into college academics.
Other introductory classes that freshman and sophomores take to satisfy prerequisites, conversely, often involve large lectures with the professor and more intimate interaction with graduate student teaching fellows. Office hours are generally more of an afterthought than a priority, making for a less personal experience than students receive from a freshman seminar. The comparative value of a freshman seminar is often not clear until students begin taking more of these classes where developing the kind of relationships that come naturally from a smaller seminar is much rarer.
The College has thus facilitated the freshman seminar program’s growth in recent years. It has pushed for offerings from a wider range of departments—cementing permanent offerings in fields like statistics and sociology—and continued to aggressively advertise the program. As students seek to determine their eventual field of concentration, a freshman seminar is quite valuable.
“As a result of active recruitment, collaborative efforts on the part of the entire administration, and partnership with department chairs, we have managed to reconfigure the program in 2015-2016,” Liviatan said. “We have really made wonderful strides in our partnerships with departments and with the higher administration.”
The College should look to continue this progress by investing more in the program. Of course, this investment does not have to be entirely financial. Encouraging advisors to recommend the seminars to students and ensuring that professors from across the University consider teaching a freshman seminar is critical. The administration should continue to grow the program by attracting new professors and offering a larger array of courses. Students often look back on freshman seminars as a highlight of their college careers, and the College should carry on in facilitating this experience. In Liviatan's words, “this is the best experience we can offer a College student.”

To the editor:
I am writing to object to The Crimson’s repeatedly labeling me "conservative" in articles mentioning my candidacy for the Board of Overseers in alliance with Ron K. Unz ’83, Ralph Nader, Lee C. Cheng ’93, and Stephen D. Hsu.
You have never asked me whether I call myself a conservative. I do not. I never have. I have never been a Republican. I have long called myself a politically independent moderate.
Of course, you are entitled to call me whatever you infer from my writings. And it would be fair to say that they show me to be more conservative on many issues than Harvard's current leadership and most academics and mainstream journalists.
But it would also be fair to say that my views on issues including the freedom of speech, civil liberties for college students (and many others), long-term imprisonment of minor drug offenders, and the estate tax are probably more liberal—as that word was generally understood at least through the turn of the century—than those of Harvard's leadership.
More importantly, I estimate my views are also more liberal than those of the vast majority of the American people. That is true on issues including racial preferences, gay rights, religious liberty, the death penalty, abortion, taxes, early education, voting rights, war powers, and many other issues.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Suddenly and as if on cue, as tends to happen with campaign surrogates days before an election, supporters of Hillary Clinton collectively advanced a curious argument. Madeline Albright, the former secretary of state, declared “There’s a special place in hell for women who don’t help each other” at a Saturday rally in New Hampshire. (It might not have helped much; Clinton would go on to lose lopsidedly.)
On Bill Maher’s show the night before, Gloria Steinem made that shaky premise even more dubious, offering that women supporting Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders were too busy chasing men to form their own opinions. “And when you’re young, you’re thinking ‘Where are the boys?’ The boys are with Bernie,” she said, apparently endorsing the same sexist, estrogen-emphasizing arguments of her past opponents.
Steinem has since retracted, Albright has doubled down, and Clinton played the “Good grief, we’re getting offended by everything these days” card, though one prominent partisan of hers—husband Bill Clinton—continued the campaign’s practice of accusing Sanders of sexism by way of insinuation and associative guilt just this weekend.
Hillary Clinton gave a neither-here-nor-there endorsement of Albright’s comment, calling it a “light-hearted but very pointed remark.” Pointed, yes, toward the conclusion that all women should unthinkingly support a women candidate and that the politics of identity eclipse policy. My condolences to the whole of womankind condemned to the fire for being unable to simultaneously support Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.
That the Clinton campaign is in a bad way among millennials is not news. Sanders took 84 percent of the Iowan millennials—and took the female millennial vote by similarly lopsided margins—understandably embarrassing for the former secretary of state. Though her campaign has enlisted the support of Lena Dunham, Kim Kardashian, and Katy Perry, nothing appears to have curried female millennial favor.
Clinton’s lazy appeals to womankind to rally behind her will be deservedly derided before dissipating in a few news cycles. But out of the particular emerges the general, and Clinton seems to be drifting into a familiar panicky pattern that forebodes future setbacks: her fondness for employing family consiglieri to do the dirty work, as if none of the stink will ever make its way back to her.
Chelsea Clinton stated, falsely, that Bernie Sanders would “dismantle” Obamacare and the Child Health Insurance Program. Bill Clinton speaks of “anger” and “resentment” toward his wife. Family bulldog David Brock peddles attacks on Sanders’s health, following the same track of Republican critics who committed themselves to a shameless campaign of shaming the secretary into releasing her medical records.
In her last try at the contest, Clinton also went wrong when surrogates ran amok. Bill stepped in it when he compared Obama’s South Carolina primary win to Jesse Jackson’s, channeling the same women-must-vote-for-women-or-go-to-hell attitude embraced heartily (or light-heartedly!) by her campaign today.
Clinton has accomplished the remarkable task of appearing the unenergetic, establishment candidate in two contests where, as the first female nominated to head a major presidential ticket, she would make history.
Campaigning has never been the strength of the former first lady—her greatest quality has always been her encyclopedic policy knowledge. As the awkward, wonky scion helming the political machine of a dynasty that has already exhausted its current eligible stock of presidential candidates, Hillary most resembles Jeb Bush, and she would probably be doing as poorly as star-crossed Jeb were the Democratic electorate as committed to self-immolation as their Republican counterparts.
Worse, less than a third of voters say they trust Clinton, who is now draping herself tightly in the progressive politics of the Obama era, and can appear a bit of a political chameleon after more than two decades of national prominence. Some of that may be the result of unfair attacks, but not all of it. Witness her recent about-face on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or her long history of opposing gay rights before LGBT rights became a campaign platform.
Populism still holds sway among Democrats, but another upstart who seemed far-fetched a few months ago now poses a serious threat to Clinton’s presidential prospects. In frightening moments like these, her campaign tends to fall back on disingenuous attacks that only further its decline.
By tarring male opponents as sexist and condemning dissatisfied woman to perdition, Clinton’s friends turn on its head what seems to be the basic point of feminism—that women be judged equally among men, not preferentially. There are good reasons to support Hillary, and there are good reasons to not. But not letting reason trump baser factionalist impulses is the central point of our democracy.

The South Asian Studies department, which replaced Sanskrit and Indian studies in 2010, is in the process of finalizing a list of candidates for its second ever tenure-track position.
The fledgling department welcomed its first tenured professor, Sunil Amrith, in the fall, and hopes that the recipient of the new post will join him in the fall of 2016.
“When you create a new department you need to build, and the idea is to build in a way that is consistent with the vision of the department and in a way that complements the people who are already here,” said South Asian Studies Department Chair Parimal G. Patil.
The department includes professors with appointments in fields including music, philosophy, anthropology, religion, and history, among others. While Patil said he does not have a particular field in mind for the new professor, the scholar will need to work in contemporary South Asian Studies, an area that he said is currently lacking.
“There’s a lot of olden times, Sanskrit, that type of interest,” South Asian Studies joint concentrator Madhavi L. Narayanan ’17 said.
Narayanan is taking Amrith’s class South Asian Studies 131: "South Asia: A Global History,” and working with him outside of class in preparation for a thesis. Amrith was hired to fill a need for a specialist in modern South Asian Studies.
Narayanan, who is one of only three students currently concentrating in the field, said Amrith’s class has more students than she’s ever seen in a South Asian Studies course.
“I think it would be cool to have more cross-listed courses especially so people aren’t just looking at South Asian Studies courses as electives, but would be able to get credit for it,” Narayanan said.
According to Amrith, while Harvard has long had strong researchers in the field of East Asian Studies, offerings in South Asian Studies fall behind many other North American universities.
“I would certainly like to see this program expand,” Amrith said. “ I think it’s a rather fruitful place for interdisciplinary study.”
Narayanan, who is joint concentrating in Government, said she would like to see the expansion include a professor who works with politics or international relations. Fellow concentrator Aliya G. Itzkowitz ’16 said she has also found the department lacking in the subject.
“I think originally I had a more ambitious [thesis] idea focusing on contemporary politics,” Itzkowitz said, adding that if she had pursued the topic, then she would have had to turn to someone in another department or school.
Regardless of their field, the new hire must be a good fit for the small department, Patil said.
“The idea is not to create islands, but to create and bring in people who can really help broaden what we’re trying to do,” Patil said. “ I guess the idea is to have a really vibrant ecosystem of people who study South Asia who are all interconnected in various ways.”

Data and science are king—or president, rather—in Carlos E. Díaz Rosillo’s class on American presidential elections, Government 1359: “The Road to the White House.”
The course, which is offered every four years to coincide with presidential elections, has seen record enrollment this semester. With more than 514 students enrolled as of Thursday night, the Road to the White House is the second largest course at the College this semester.
Gov 1359 is not your typical government course. While the class has a syllabus, its curriculum closely follows the events of each presidential election, which now in 2016 is  heating up as the field narrows. As a result, no two iterations of the course are exactly alike.
“It was really cool because we studied what a primary is, what a caucus is, exactly a week after the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucus, and exactly a day before the first-in-the-nation New Hampshire primary,” Díaz Rosillo, a Government lecturer and resident dean of Dunster House, said.
But the course does not merely cover the ins and outs of the campaign news cycle; rather, it is a rigorous application of scientific theory to the reality of the current election, Díaz Rosillo said.
“The class is not a political class; it’s a political science class,” he said. “What we try to do in class is study cutting edge political science theory on campaigns and elections, and then we use the current campaigns as a lab in which students can explore whether the theories they’re learning in class actually apply to real life campaigns.”
Recently, students studied the different models by which political scientists predict election outcomes, along with the advantages and shortcomings of each of the systems. Students saw the limitations of how polling played out in Iowa, where early projections did not accurately predict results.
The course’s emphasis on data analysis stems in part from Díaz Rosillo’s background as a civil engineer. Trained at Tufts University, Díaz Rosillo says he sees political science as a kind of engineering, in which one can use data to explain political trends.
“I like to understand processes and how things work, and why they work the way they do,” Díaz Rosillo said. “Even though the two fields, engineering and social science, seem so different, they’re really not because they’re both about using data to analyze things; they’re about using data to make decisions.”
Decision-making quickly became the focus of Díaz Rosillo’s work when he chose to study public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School. In addition to teaching the Road to the White House, Díaz Rosillo also researches and teaches about executive power at all levels of government. Government 94fg: “Presidents, Governors, and Mayors: Chief Executive Power in Comparative Perspective” was offered in the fall.
Díaz Rosillo’s current research emphasizes the use of data to inform presidential campaigns at the local and precinct levels, a project he hopes will soon yield positive results and “help somebody run a better and more effective campaign.”
In the meantime, students en masse are enrolling in the Road to the White House, although the course counts only as an elective, even for Government concentrators.
“I’m pretty confident that people are taking the class not because they can check off a box but because they’re really interested in the material,” Díaz Rosillo said.
Miranda L. Ryshawy ’18, who described herself as someone who generally does not follow elections closely, said that a desire to understand this year’s election on a more scientific level, along with encouragement from her roommate, prompted her interest in the class.
“This is the first election I’m going to be able to vote in,” she said. “I think I will definitely look back on it as my baptism into being an active citizen.”
Edgar A. Carrero ’19 has also enjoyed the course.
“It’s interesting to analyze a bit deeper than what you read about online,” he said.
As the election season progresses, students will continue to apply their skills of analysis in real time. Applying his own analytical skills, Díaz Rosillo offered predictions for the Republican and Democratic nominees. Based on current data, he said he was confident the Democratic nomination would go to former Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton. The Republican nominee, however, is not as clear cut.
“I think based on the data and based on what we know right now, I’d say it’s going to be Donald Trump or Marco Rubio,” Díaz Rosillo said.

Having missed the start to cuffing season and looking for alternatives to Tinder, 3,300 of Harvard’s lovelorn students are taking their quest for a Valentine digital this year by enrolling in Datamatch.
The survey has already attracted roughly half of the undergraduate student body, with 500 more female than male students signing up thus far. Quincy House leads the registrations as of publication with 258 potential matches, and Pforzheimer is in last with 185, according to Raynor J. Kuang ’17, the leader of the development team.
Now in its 21st year, the most recent rendition of the Harvard Computer Society’s annual online matchmaking service features a number of changes from previous editions.
Most noticeably, this year’s survey was developed in collaboration with campus humor magazine Satire V and included consulting from Psychology professor Steven A. Pinker.
Satire V. said they prioritized humor above the search for true love.
“I think we upped the ante,” Daniel J. Kenny ’18, an editor of Satire V, said. “We didn’t write the questions with personality traits in mind, we just wrote whatever questions that we thought were funny.”
One question, for example, asked potential matches which class they identified with in bed. Risqué responses included Harvard’s mandatory freshman writing class; “everyone’s been in me at some point,” the large introductory economics course; “700 people are involved,” and the notoriously difficult CS50; “stay up until 4AM and end up leaving with a new t-shirt.”
Another question prompted students to fill in the blank: “If I had to have a romantic tryst with an author I would pick…,” to which respondents were offered options such as “Leo Tolstoy–length matters,” “Dr. Seuss–I would do it here, I would do it there, I would do it anywhere,” “George R.R. Martin–I just hope I don’t get killed off,” and “Gabriel Garcia Marquez–One Hundred Years of Solitude.”
In improving the survey’s sense of humor, however, the HCS development team did not forget to also keep in mind an ultimate goal of the service: to match compatible people with one another. To this end, the team consulted Pinker, a noted behavioral scientist, on the psychology of human attraction.
Kuang said HCS tried to use their conversation with Pinker to inform this year’s matching process.
“We tried to use that to help the algorithm,” he said, “but the basic principle remains: obviously, the more similar you are, the more likely we are to match you.”
And Datamatch has so far proven itself a capable matcher, if not cupid. Kuang recalled anecdotal evidence of numerous couples who emailed him and said Datamatch had paired them together years earlier.
Still, Kuang emphasized that real romance was not the purpose of the service.
“Datamatch is completely casual,” he said. “If you’re not looking for a relationship, if you’re in a relationship already and you’re just looking to do it for fun, it’s not something where you feel like you have to reach out to people.”
“And it doesn’t hurt that there’s free food,” Kuang added.
Indeed, for many students, perhaps the most enticing aspect is the promise of a potential date with free food. With some funding from the Undergraduate Council, this year the computer society is partnering with local eateries Zinneken’s, El Jefe’s, Clover, and Pinkberry to pay for the meals of matched couples on their first “date.”
So far, the promise of free food has swayed at least one student to participate.
“At first, I was waffling between doing it or not,” said Ryan K. Sim ‘19. “But then I decided—hey, I’ll do it for Zinneken’s.”
The survey doesn’t close until just before Valentine’s day, so students still have plenty of time to register.

The pungent odor that greeted students in Adams House dining hall since late last week was eradicated Tuesday following a sequence of repairs over the weekend. 
The smell, which was detectable throughout the dining hall, Adams’ Gold Room common space, the library, and at least one of the undergraduate entryways, stemmed from a pipe that broke in the dining hall dish room last Friday, Harvard University Dining Services spokesperson Crista Martin wrote in an emailed statement.
The dining hall remained open during repairs, although the dish room was closed and students used disposable plates and cutlery in the meantime.
“Because of its location, we had to close the dining hall dish room while the break was excavated, the pipe repaired, and the floor and tiling replaced,” Martin wrote.
Co-social chair of Adams House Committee Anna T. Wechsler ’18 said the source of the odor, which she described as smelling like trash, initially was a mystery.
“People were a little taken aback and confused by why there was this awful smell hanging about,” Wechsler said. “It persisted for a few days before anyone really knew what was going on.”
Adams House resident Mike Skerrett ’18 said he chose to eat elsewhere on campus until the smell was removed.
“I think I had one meal in the dining hall when it was smelling badly and then I decided to eat in Quincy the rest of the time,” he said.
Some students expressed frustration over the Adams House email list at what they said was a lack of updates from House administrators.
Adams House Committee secretary Ajay Singh ’18 sent an email to the House administrators and House masters requesting an official statement regarding the odor and voicing student concerns about potential health risks.
“Most people had an idea it was being worked on, they just didn’t know exactly what was going on,” Singh said. “That’s what initiated my email, to see if they could inform us a bit more.”
Co-master of Adams House Sean Palfrey responded to Singh’s email confirming that the odor posed no health risk. Administrators continued to send updates over the weekend on the repair progress and suggested alternate study spaces.
Singh noted that some students were not as bothered by the odor as others.
“Most people were okay. They kind of got used to it,” Singh said. “It’s kind of based on people’s tolerance levels. I heard people complain about it and a lot of the time it was mainly jokes.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Student organizations requesting high levels of Undergraduate Council funding will be required to send executive board members to sexual assault prevention training under a new ordinance passed by the UC’s Finance Committee.
Seven members of the committee voted unanimously Wednesday to pass the legislation, entitled “The Finance Committee Sexual Assault Prevention Ordinance of 2016.” William A. Greenlaw ’17, the chair of the committee that allocates more than $300,000 to student organizations each year, said he proposed the legislation in response to growing concerns over Harvard’s sexual assault climate. 
“The issue of sexual assault has captivated the student body on campus,” Greenlaw said. “We’re definitely interested in getting more and more people trained.”
Under the ordinance, recognized student organizations that receive UC funding above a “high value” threshold must send a certain proportion of executive board members to a one-hour long bystander intervention training session each semester.
Some details of  the program have yet to be determined, including the specific monetary threshold at which bystander intervention training will be mandatory and the exact proportion of executive board members who will be required to complete training. The Finance Committee will analyze previous allocations to determine the attendance requirement and funding threshold, and could vote on the matter as early as next week, Greenlaw said.
Representatives from the Office for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response and the Consent Advocates and Relationship Educators will provide free training for student groups that fall within the new requirements. Organizations that already have existing partnerships with and have received training from OSAPR, such as the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club, will be exempt from the new requirements, according to Greenlaw.
The aim of the legislation, according to the Finance Committee’s vice chair of policy Olu Oisaghie ’19, is to provide financial incentive to student groups that agree to help combat sexual assault on campus.
“One of the main ways that we interact with the student body is through student organizations and especially through student leaders,” UC Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17 said. “This reform on Ficom would ensure that the student leaders at this school are fully equipped to host safe events and start cultural change within their organizations.”
The policy will run on a one-semester pilot program, and the Finance Committee will eventually reasses the program’s effectiveness to decide whether to continue the initiative, Greenlaw said.
Fran F. Swanson ’17, an OSAPR intern and co-director of CARE, praised the program in an email, writing that “programming that empowers students to challenge harmful behaviors and attitudes is essential to creating lasting cultural change on campus.”
“And this change begins in the smaller communities that we work with and socialize in,” she added.
Although all members of the Finance Committee who were in attendance supported the policy, some raised concerns over the logistic feasibility of the new requirements. Finance Committee member Jullian A. Duran ’18, who is training to become a CARE representative, questioned whether CARE had the resources and personnel to handle the volume of new training sessions under the legislation.
“My understanding of CARE’s membership is that they have a lot of people as CARE reps, but it’s very volunteer based,” Duran said.
In response, the legislation includes a clause that gives the Finance Committee permission to waive the training requirement if training sessions “cannot be conducted in a logistically feasible manner.”
The policy is projected to take effect within two weeks after UC representatives notify student organizations of the new requirements. According to the legislation, the Finance Committee will enlist the support of the Office of Student Life, who will provide the UC with rosters of club officers.
Rules Committee Chair Daniel R. Levine ’17, an inactive Crimson editor, confirmed that the program is consistent with the UC’s constitution and bylaws.
While the new legislation would prevent the Finance Committee from distributing high-value grants to organizations that have not met the training requirements, the UC as a general body has the authority to overrule the Finance Committee’s funding allocations during general meetings. The UC has generally approved the committee’s recommended grant packages without amendments or objections.
“It’s an opportunity for [representatives] to ask questions about the Finance Committee’s policy, and dissent if they wish,” Levine said.
Greenlaw, who campaigned for the UC presidency on a platform that would incentivize student organizations to conduct sexual assault training, said the new requirements may widely spread bystander intervention training among undergraduates.
“If we do it right, we’ll train a significant portion of this campus,” Greenlaw said.

In light of his recent departure from the Office of Student Life, Mather House Masters have awarded former Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde a new “Rampant Lion Award” award to commemorate his commitment to House life.
The award, named after the lions on Mather’s House crest, serves to honor Lassonde’s contributions to Mather, where he and his wife currently live. Lassonde left his former position as one of the College’s top administrators on Feb. 1, but will continue to work and live at the College  until the end of the spring semester. At the semester’s close, Lassonde said he will leave Harvard. 
Earlier this semester Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced that Lassonde would be leaving his post at the Office of Student Life. Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 shuffled into the College’s Interim Dean of Student Life post, and Sheila C. Thimba, Dean for Administration at the College, will lead the committee to search for a replacement for Lassonde.
“I was really flattered to get it,” Lassonde said, referring to the award. “I’ve been at Mather House for three years and loved every minute of it.”
Mather’s students and staff alike have lauded Lassonde’s what they called his strong presence in the House.
“He eats in the dining hall all the time, he talks to students all the time,”  Mather House co-Master Michael D. Rosengarten said. “He has been a pillar and a really great person.”
Avni Nahar ’17, co-chair of Mather’s House Committee, said last week that Lassonde is “always a friendly face.”
Rosengarten praised Lassonde in a speech on Tuesday, saying that “Mather is proud to announce the creation of the Mather Rampant lion award for extraordinary Mather Fellows,” according to a transcript he provided to The Crimson. He said Lassonde purposely chose to live in Mather House, where he has helped make the residence a more welcoming environment for students.
In a post on a Mather House's public Facebook group, Rosengarten explained the symbolism of a rampant lion: “the rampant position is when a lion balances on one hind leg and uses the three others to defend itself. In fact looking back to the crest of the Mather family indeed the lions were rampant, so rampant lions are the symbols of Mather, and the defense for our house, our community and our people.”
At the OSL, Dingman has begun shuffling between his two deanships and plans to propose no "spanking-new" initiatives as he delegates work to other administrators.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard detailed two updates to its Allston plans Thursday at a mostly conflict-free Harvard-Allston Task Force meeting.
Interim task force chair John A. Bruno opened the meeting with the display of his new gavel, a gift from an Allston resident.
“You may regret it,” said Bruno, brandishing the gavel towards the audience.
Bruno characterized his last consultation with Kevin Casey, Harvard’s associate vice president for public affairs and communications, as “spirited,” and said he hoped for accord and civility in the meeting to follow.
Casey led the discussion and gave an overview of the University’s first and second amendments to its Institutional Master Plan for development in Allston. The Boston Redevelopment Authority, Boston’s urban planning agency, had published both amendments online in the last two weeks.
In particular, Casey discussed Harvard’s decision to relocate the energy facility intended to service the University’s proposed $1 billion complex for the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
Casey also detailed Harvard’s plans to renovate Harvard Business School student housing along the Charles River and to temporarily realign Western Avenue to reduce traffic congestion caused by SEAS complex construction, slated to begin in 2016 and continue through 2020.
“Over the course of the four years of this project there will be continuous service and we won’t be disrupting the flow of cars, bikers, and walkers,” Casey said.
Harvard will file its official plans to renovate Business School housing with the BRA next month, Casey said. He added that the renovations will take place over a four-year period so that the school can continue to provide housing to students during construction.
In response to community feedback on preliminary designs, Casey presented an update to the design of Harvard’s Life Lab, a biotechnology research and enterprise facility scheduled to open in fall of 2016. The new design features an improved front on Western Ave., more windows, and enhanced landscaping around the building.
Casey highlighted the community benefits Harvard has proposed in connection with the Life Lab. Along with ice cream socials held at the i-Lab, the Business School will provide access to Chromebook laptops for every K-12 public school student in Allston and Brighton.
Near the close of the meeting, Thomas M. Lally, an Allston resident and regular meeting attendee, questioned the task force’s process for nominating and selecting the body’s members. Invoking the Bill of Rights, Lally called for direct community involvement in the election of task force representatives.
“The community has a concern that we aren’t comfortable with the BRA and Harvard sitting down and deciding how they’re going to represent us,” said Lally.
Bruno, who has in the past expressed frustration with what he called the inefficiency of task force meetings, had a different take on member selection.
“The substance of what we need to do and read about is significantly more important than the folks that are going to represent you. Really,” Bruno said.

In an effort to encourage students to eat less red meat this February, Harvard’s Environmental Action Committee is bringing a national campaign called the "Veguary Challenge" to Harvard’s dining halls.
The committee, a student group centered on campus issues of sustainability, has focused on reducing meat consumption this year. In an email, EAC co-Chair Naomi G. Asimow ’18 linked animal agriculture to increased methane emissions and Amazonian rainforest destruction.
As part of the challenge to reduce the amount of meat students eat, Asimow said EAC has been working with Harvard University Dining Services to increase students’ understanding of their typical meat consumption.
The Veguary challenge, to eat less meat this month than usual, aims to excite students about the group’s broader campaign, Asimow said.
“We thought it could be a cool culmination of this meat project we’ve been working on,” Asimow said. “We’d like to raise enough awareness of the issue that students will continue to be conscious of their meat consumption beyond the month of February.”
Frank B. Hu, a professor at the School of Public Health specializing in nutrition and epidemiology, said eating red meat is most detrimental to personal health when it reaches over-consumption. Processed red meat has been linked to adverse health outcomes such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and even some cancers, so cutting back, especially in high consumption, is a good idea, he said.
Still, Hu cautioned students against cutting red meat without considering protein alternatives. “It’s very important not just to recommend people cut back on red meat, but also recommend healthy alternatives,” he said.
According to assistant professor Gary Adamkiewicz, who is an environmental health researcher at HSPH, the current global diet is not ideal. Particularly, he said, beef production in excess is an inefficient way to feed the planet due to its larger footprint, which requires a disproportionate amount of carbon, water, feed grain, and land.
“Dietary changes are certainly among the most promising leverage we have as individuals to reduce our environmental footprints,” he said.
Adamkiewicz said personal diet is becoming a growing part of the discussion about sustainability, environment, and health.
While 'Veguary' lasts for only a month, Asimow said her ultimate goal is to reduce the overall amount of meat or have “more sustainable meat” served in undergraduate dining halls.
“We don’t have control over the type of meat we eat because we all eat in the dining hall, so for us the best thing we could do is to eat less meat,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
South Korean activist and musician Hyung Joon Won discussed his efforts to promote the reunification of North Korea and South Korea through classical music on Wednesday evening as part of the Conversations with Kirkland speaker series.
Won, a Juilliard-trained violinist, has worked for more than eight years to create an ensemble that allows young musicians from North Korea and South Korea to interact through music rather than politics. 
Won said Maestro Daniel Barenboim inspired him to establish an orchestra comprising musicians from both nations. Barenboim co-founded the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, which brings Israeli, Palestinian, and Arab musicians together in spite of political tensions.
Won emphasized his discontent and frustration with the political systems in North Korea and South Korea. He has attempted on multiple occasions to bring young musicians together to perform in peace concerts in places ranging from Germany to the Korean Demilitarized Zone, but policy agreements fell through each time, he said.
“This...joint orchestra program between North and South. It’s not like a dream. It’s a must for us,” Won said.
Won explained his theory of utilizing the unifying nature of music and the structure of an orchestra to create peace and unity between North Korea and South Korea.
“So many instruments with different sounds, but they produce harmony. That’s amazing,” Won said. “And I wish those leaders in big positions can be touched [by the music].”
Won expressed his desire to make the intentions of his project known to the international community and government officials in particular.
“We must convince politicians, especially North and South Koreans,” he said. “But just convincing those politicians is difficult because they don’t play music.”
Although he has faced logistical and political difficulties when organizing performances, Won proposed using technology to bring together the musicians separated by the border.
“I’m sure Bill Gates or [Mark] Zuckerberg can help,” he said.
During his talk, Won performed Chaconne by Johann Sebastian Bach on his violin. Won selected this piece because it is a “tragic dance” that he believes depicts the tensions between North Korea and South Korea.
The event was co-hosted by the student organization Harvard Human Rights in North Korea.
Following the event, co-president of HRiNK  Joseph L. Choe ’17 said his group’s stance on the reunification of North Korea and South Korea is “pretty neutral.”
“Our focus is mainly on human rights and making sure that these people are not being deprived of these basic rights,” he added.
Some students in attendance appreciated Won’s musical activism.
“It is nice to know that there are people who actually do things like this,” said Austin Shin ’19.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming into this season, the No. 9/9 Harvard men’s hockey team’s offense had the look of one that could make a push towards a national championship. Returning all three members of a potent first line that combined for 61 goals last season—as well as adding freshman forward Ryan Donato to the mix—the Crimson attack looked poised to challenge the nation’s best defenses.
There was, however, one caveat to these national title aspirations: whether Harvard’s defense could bolster up enough to allow for a legitimate run through ECAC play.
As Harvard (13-7-3, 9-4-3 ECAC) readies for a weekend home slate against Rensselaer (14-10-6, 6-4-6) and Union (10-10-8, 3-8-5), the defense has almost certainly held up its half of the bargain.
Even after losing former defensemen Patrick McNally and Max Everson and goaltender Steve Michalek to graduation, the defense has not dropped off from its performance last season. The unit is still middle of the pack in the conference but has actually dropped its goals-per-game-allowed total from 2.34 to 2.09 in league play--all this despite an overall increase in scoring in ECAC games.
Some of the credit goes to sophomore goaltender Merrick Madsen as well.
“Merrick has done a great job on the back end,” junior defenseman Clay Anderson said. “I think we just came in from the beginning of the year and worked hard. We knew we could score goals at a high rate and it was a question if we could keep them out of the net. And I think so far we’ve done a decent job.”
A big part of the defense’s success this year lies with senior defenseman Desmond Bergin and Anderson. The two upperclassmen lead a relatively young unit, with both players posting above six in the plus-minus category during conference play.
Senior Brayden Jaw’s return from injury after the overtime loss against No. 1/1 Quinnipiac  helped strengthen the defense’s core. The team allowed an average of 3.75 goals per game in his absence over the first half of January.
The defense will look to keep RPI in a scoring slump this Friday. The team has only scored two goals in its last three games—all of which were losing efforts. But the Engineers boast junior forward Riley Bourbonnais, who has 13 goals on the entire season, good for sixth in the ECAC.
The Crimson offense may face a stiff challenge of its own going up against netminder Jason Kasdorf. The senior has played in 79 games over his career and boasts a .934 save percentage on the season.
“I think [we need to be] better in the neutral zone, being better on the forecheck,” junior Tyler Moy said. “Those are a lot of things we’ve been trying to apply in practice this week.”
Despite the team’s three-game winless skid, RPI still sits in fourth place in the conference standings, which would guarantee the team a first-round bye in the ECAC Tournament.
The same cannot be said about Union, however, as the team inhabits ninth place in the standings. The team has failed to find its stride ever since the New Year, having won only one game since January 3rd. But in a league where second place and seventh place are separated by four points, no team is easily defeated.
“These are two big games,” Anderson said. “We’re really looking forward to two exciting home games and hopefully get four points.”
The Dutchmen are less than two season removed from a NCAA National Championship, but they have quickly fallen through the ranks of the conference. Union does not rank in the top five in either goals per game or goals allowed per contest. Sophomores Spencer Foo and and Ryan Scarfo are the two bright spots on the Dutchmen offense, both having notched 12 thus far on the year.
With only three weekends left, the Crimson is tied for second in the league with Yale; only three points separate the squad from losing its grasp on a first-round bye.
“We know where we stand as of right now,” Anderson said. “We definitely an eye on the standings.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the last few weekends have been historic for the Harvard men’s basketball team, the record books have been dusted off for all the wrong reasons.
After dropping both ends of an Ivy League weekend doubleheader at Lavietes for the first time since 2009, the Crimson (9-13, 1-5 Ivy League) followed up the performance with back-to-back duds against Princeton and Penn. The 21-point loss to Princeton was the team’s worst in league play since 2010, while the five-game conference losing streak is the worst since 2008.
“Obviously, it hasn’t been ideal,” junior forward Zena Edosomwan said. “It’s a position we’ve never been in. It’s been tough, we’ve had some heartbreakers and things that haven’t gone our way in our league unfortunately. We’re in a tough position, but the older guys, their spirits are really good, knowing that we don’t give up.”
With four weekends of basketball left to be played, Harvard finds itself in the basement of the Ivy League standings, sharing the space with Dartmouth. The Crimson will have a chance to right the ship on Friday when it plays host to Brown (7-13, 2-4), a team to which Tommy Amaker’s squad has not fallen since 2009. Yale (15-5, 6-0), the hottest team in the Ivy League and the favorite to claim the Crimson’s spot in the Ancient Eight penthouse, will visit Lavietes the next night.
Harvard will be aided on both ends of the floor by the return of Edosomwan, who missed the Crimson’s last two games with a thigh injury. The team’s leading scorer and rebounder confirmed on Wednesday that he will play this weekend. Against Princeton and Penn, Harvard was outrebounded 88-59 and allowed 88 points in the paint. Meanwhile forwards Evan Cummins, Weisner Perez, and Chris Egi combined for just 21 points and 19 rebounds.
“That was tough,” Edosomwan said. “I told the trainer, not in a bad way, but I never want to be in this position again, in street clothes…. It’s always fun to play in front of the home crowd and I’m excited for it. I’m honestly just excited to be back. I’m really hungry and hopefully I can let the play do the talking.”
The front end of the twin bill will feature a Bears team that has had an uncharacteristically average start to its conference slate. Following a split against the Gentleman’s C’s, Brown finds itself tied for fifth place in the Ivy League. The Bears have not finished in the conference’s top three since 2008.
The Bears will be met by a Crimson team that has the dubious distinction of being last in the Ivy League in points per game despite allowing the second-fewest points per game. Unlike the NBA’s All-Stars, Harvard can ill afford to leave its defense behind this weekend as all-Ivy forward Cedric Kuakumensah and junior guard Tavon Blackmon provide a formidable inside-out offensive punch for Brown. The duo is one of just two Ivy League duos that average over 12 points per game and shoot over 45 percent from the field.
Going to toe-to-toe with Blackmon will be freshman point guard Tommy McCarthy, who adopted more of an offensive role last weekend. The first-year starter averaged 12 points and 3.5 assists in the two games without his favorite target in the lineup.
The contest will also take on special meaning for another Harvard starter. Senior forward Agunwa Okolie will be squaring off with his younger brother, Obi, a freshman guard for the Bears. The younger Okolie is averaging 6.9 points per game in 11 contests. The brothers’ parents will be making the trip from Ajax, Ontario for Friday’s showdown.
“It’s an unbelievable opportunity,” the elder Okolie said. “Not many people can say that they are playing against their sibling at a fellow Ivy League school, so it’s a wonderful opportunity to cherish the moment, especially with my brother. My family is going to be there as well so we are pretty excited about this.”
The weekend headliner will come on Saturday evening when the Bulldogs come sauntering into Cambridge. Yale is riding a 10-game win streak and leads the Ivy League in field goal percentage, rebounds per game, and opponents’ points per game.
The Elis have consistently played the role of Harvard’s little brother during the Crimson’s recent Ivy League dominance. Amaker’s team defeated the Bulldogs in a one-game playoff for a spot in the NCAA Tournament last season, and Yale has finished second or third in the Ivy four of the past five seasons.
But James Jones’ squad has dominated conference play thus far and appears poised to make its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 1962  The Bulldogs are averaging an 18-point margin of victory, which would set an Ivy League record if it holds.
Yale is one of the most balanced teams Harvard has faced this season, with all five starters averaging at least seven points a contest, including reigning Ivy League Player of the Year Justin Sears and forward Brandon Sherrod, who made NCAA history earlier this season after hitting 30 consecutive field goals. Sherrod missed last season while singing with the Whiffenpoofs. Okolie, who has guarded the likes of Kansas guard Frank Mason III and Providence star Kris Dunn, will be tasked with neutralizing the versatile 6’8” Sears.
“They’re very challenging,” Okolie said. “We just have to make sure that everybody on our team on the floor is locked in on their own man, with help side defense and on the ball defense and make sure that our rotations are as quick as possible.”
While the Crimson has struggled overall, the team has saved some of its best performances for its top opponents. Harvard has led at halftime against three of the top five teams it has faced this season (according to kenpom.com) and fell to No. 6 Kansas by just six points on the road.
The Crimson will need more consistency from sharpshooters sophomore Corey Johnson and junior Corbin Miller if it wants to keep pace with the high-scoring Bulldog attack. The duo has shot just 25 percent from three in conference play, well below the 42 percent they shot during nonconference play.
“When things don’t go our way, we don’t turn away, we’re still going to face it head-on and continue to battle and grind it out and see what happens,” Edosomwan said. “At this point, you take care of what you can take care of and that’s going out there every weekend and battling, hopefully coming out with wins and the rest of it is out of our control.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As we near the midpoint of the Ivy League season, preseason narratives are beginning to take shape. After losing Siyani Chambers ’16 to an ACL injury before the year started, Harvard was projected a distant fourth in the standings behind the league’s academic middle class—Yale, Princeton, and Columbia. Narrow losses to Providence and Kansas and a run to the finals of the Diamond Head Classic changed the story on the Crimson temporarily, but injuries and defensive lapses have induced a market correction. After five straight losses, Harvard carries the worst point differential in the Ancient Eight.
The three preseason favorites, by contrast, have gone 13-0 against the rest of the league. Yet calling it a three-team race is a bit misleading. Through six games, Yale is on pace to be one of the most dominant teams in the last two decades. The Bulldogs have six of their remaining eight games on the road—including trips to Morningside Heights and Jadwin Gymnasium—but have aced their first exams. After some early-season struggles, Yale is knocking on the door of Ken Pomeroy’s top 50. That plateau hasn’t been crossed since the Harvard teams of 2012 and 2014, statistically the two best league champions of the 21st century.
The battle for second between the league’s welterweights, Columbia and Princeton, highlights the third full weekend of play. Despite starting 5-1, Columbia has been less than impressive—barely surviving a Harvard team without junior forward Zena Edosomwan and needing a late run to get past Brown. Princeton, by contrast, put up a much better fight against Yale and ran Harvard out of the gym. Tiger forward Henry Caruso is a matchup nightmare at the four and gives Princeton a lot of lineup flexibility. Of all the teams in the league, only the Tigers can ably punish Yale for going big with seniors Justin Sears and noted Whiffenpoof Brandon Sherrod. While Yale is the definite favorite heading down the stretch, Princeton has the best shot at knocking it off.
For the remainder of the league, the future is much rosier than the present. Lost in Yale’s dominance has been the emergence of one of the most productive freshman classes in recent memory. Cornell’s Matt Morgan ranks second the league in scoring, performing with decent efficiency for the league’s highest-volume shooter. Just behind him is Dartmouth’s Evan Bourdeaux, who in his first year on campus has been better than 2015 graduate Gabas Maldunas—arguably the best Big Green player of the last five years.
Beyond the cream of the crop is a deep pool of contributors. Both Penn and Harvard boast freshmen backcourts with tough-nosed point guards and excellent spot-up shooters. Princeton’s Devin Cannady is knocking on the door of the starting lineup with stellar backcourt contributions—ranking among the league’s top 20 in scoring while approaching the rarified 50-40-90 air of efficiency. Rounding out the impressive group is quality talents Troy Whiteside, Weisner Perez, and Max Rotschil—all of whom have shown All-Ivy flashes in small samples.
On the backs of this freshman class comes a group of high school seniors whose next four years will do a lot to determine the league’s future. Harvard brings in a pair of ESPN Top-100 recruits in Chris Lewis and Robert Baker Jr. in a class ranked an absurd 10th in the nation. However, the league’s incoming talent runs deeper than that—both Penn and Yale bring in three-star recruits in deep classes.
Lewis and Baker Jr. are crucial quintessential components of the vision Harvard coach Tommy Amaker sells to recruits—a Top 25 basketball program paired with the world’s best education. Amaker isn’t the first, nor the only, Ivy League coach to pitch this on the recruiting trail, but he’s by far the most successful. It isn’t surprising that Amaker can recruit (after all, the same man brought the nation’s no. 1 recruiting class to New Jersey, a feat more impressive than taking a Valentine to Qdoba); what’s unexpected is that the demand exists for the pitch.
After all, it runs contrary to jock stereotypes to expect the nation’s best athletes to choose to challenge themselves academically—especially with UNC offering the degree equivalent of Natural Disasters and Kentucky hosting freshmen on a glorified seven-month training camp. Harvard’s ability to establish proof of concept could be a huge boon for the league’s elite. James Jones, Mitch Henderson, and Kyle Smith can all pitch roughly the same academic credentials at Harvard and ascendant basketball programs. With expanded financial aid eliminating a historical recruiting barrier, a deep run by an Ivy League team could close the gap further.
For now, a wild three-team race begins. On to the picks:
PRINCETON AT CORNELL
Cornell is the league’s biggest wild card. Morgan and backcourt mate Robert Hatter rank one-two in the league in scoring but are high-volume chuckers whose efficiency is hard to predict. When they are on, the Big Red are hard to stop. When they aren’t, it gets ugly quick. Against Princeton, who has the guard play to break the Cornell press with ease, it won’t be pretty.
Pick: Cornell
PENN AT COLUMBIA
After sweeping a home Ivy weekend, Penn has restored some faith to a Palestra that has seen a young team endure significant growing pains this weekend. Senior Darien Nelson-Henry gives the team one of the league’s most reliable deep post threats and helps bail out freshmen Jake Silpe and Jackson Donahue from the burden of having to create their own shot late in the shot clock. Penn doesn’t have nearly enough three-point shooting to win here, but it will be competitive down the stretch.
Pick: Columbia
YALE AT DARTMOUTH
The last time Yale went to Hanover, it let the Ivy title slip through its grasp. On a four-game slide, Dartmouth doesn’t look capable of repeating the feat.
Pick: Yale
BROWN AT HARVARD
Brown has long been the league’s backstop. Losing streaks die at home against the Bears, and Friday night—with Harvard getting Edosomwan back from injury—looks to be no different.
Pick: Harvard
PENN AT CORNELL
Even Captain Morgan might not make it out to this one.
Pick: Cornell
BROWN AT DARTMOUTH
After the poise they displayed in two games against a full-strength Crimson, Dartmouth’s recent play has to be considered disappointing. This is a young team whose two best players (sophomore Miles Wright and Boudreaux) are underclassmen that doesn’t excel in any particular area, but is well balanced in most. Wright in particular hasn’t scored in double digits in the last four games and if his team is going to rebound, it needs him to take a major leap.
Pick: Dartmouth
PRINCETON AT COLUMBIA
This game carries heavy importance for Columbia, who still has to travel to Princeton and host Yale at home. The Lions are dependent on when their shaky defense shows up. Against both Yale and Harvard, it stayed close when it was able to force turnovers and fell behind when its opponents hit its shots. Against the league’s second-best shooting team, that’s a recipe for disaster.
Pick: Princeton
YALE AT HARVARD
This rivalry has historically been the cream of the league. I wrote twice last year about the barbs fired at Harvard by Yale coach James Jones, whose obsession with knocking Harvard off its perch is thinly veiled at best. Yale has a rare two-game winning streak at Lavietes, scoring the league’s only win against the 2014 Crimson and winning what looked to be a league-deciding Friday night contest a year ago.
That story ended in the most heartbreaking of fashions—after an epic collapse against Dartmouth and a final-minute defeat in the playoff, Yale was not selected for a postseason tournament. With Sherrod providing a perfect frontcourt fit to reigning Ivy League Player of the Year Justin Sears, Yale has a scary combination of excellent interior defense and spot-up shooting. Sherrod, whose record-setting streak of 30 consecutive makes came almost entirely within five feet of the basket, gives Yale a safety valve that each coach in the league would take in a heartbeat.
On the other side of the floor, the Crimson will be better with a rejuvenated Edosomwan, but asking Johnson and McCarthy to handle Yale guards Jack Montague and Makai Mason will be too much.
