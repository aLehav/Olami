After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“How’s freshman year going?”
This question, though innocent enough in years past, has developed a whole new meaning in the era of COVID, quarantine, and Zoom classes. Most of the people asking me this question — family, friends from home, and, in particular, upperclassmen — want to know exactly that: how I feel with the exigent fear of COVID hanging over me, existing in a state of perpetual quarantine, and taking all of my classes online, where, wonderfully, I get to stare at blank gray squares for hours on end instead of seeing my classmates’ faces.
These facts of student life, though, are not what come to mind when I’m asked this question. When I hear those four words, the answer my brain immediately drums together is not necessarily a coherent response filled with thoughtful reflections or understandable frustrations. When I’m asked this question, I think of a noise.
A very specific noise. A wrinkly, raucous noise. A noise only the class of 2024 will truly understand.
This noise is the sound of a brown paper bag wrinkling. To be more precise, the sound of a comically oversized, somehow extremely feeble takeout bag. As we freshmen scurried across the Science Center Plaza, anxious to reheat our plastic cartons of chili, we gawked and buried our heads — the awkwardness of Annenberg’s traditional musical chairs displaced onto the cacophony of a paper bag. How, in fact, did our paper bags create an entire orchestra at the merest rustle of wind or knock against the knee? I may never know.
What I do know, though, is what our paper bags represent: Though we might be in Annenberg, we would never have the classic Annenberg experience many Harvard students keep so fondly in their memories. Before quarantine began in March, when I imagined myself at Harvard, I pictured a future me seated around a glossy wooden table in a Harry Potter-looking dining hall, laughing with friends while eating Veritas-stamped waffles. But instead of delving into existential discussions with classmates or pressing gossip with friends over trays of hot food, I selected from an assortment of plastic-encased dishes and hurried back to my dorm.
Throughout the fall, as I climbed four flights of stairs with my takeout bag, the noise created by the wrinkling of paper left me wondering what might have been: What would my life have been like if we were able to eat inside Annenberg? Would I know different people? Would I know the same people, but somehow know them better?
These questions are, unfortunately, unanswerable — and they are exactly what I think of when I’m asked how my freshman year is going. I’ve tried convincing myself there may be something poignant in the sound of a takeout bag, but I’m only reminded of what I’m missing. I try to imagine that our class is stronger because of our unique, shared experience in the era of Annenberg takeout, but I keep resorting to the belief that our “Berg bags” have fundamentally robbed us of a quintessential Harvard experience.
But, as these thoughts all circulate after being asked how freshman year is going, I start feeling guilty: We were lucky to be on campus. We were lucky to even have our paper takeout bags. We were lucky to feel embarrassed at that awful, ubiquitous wrinkling. I shouldn’t feel anything but grateful.
I don’t explain my Annenberg-takeout woes to the posers of this question; I know they really only care to hear that I’m grateful, if not a bit annoyed with Zoom breakout rooms. I also think people may expect me to have more extensive complaints beyond the sound of a paper bag: Aren’t I lonely? Am I not tired of virtual social events? Isn’t it annoying not being able to recognize people with their masks on?
I offer them the answers I think they want to hear only because it makes everyone’s day easier. But, in reality, taking courses in the era of COVID isn’t just my new normal — it’s my only normal. I don’t know any different; I don’t know what it’s like to have an in-person seminar discussing Kierkegaard or an in-person comp meeting. I only know what I’ve experienced, and much of this experience was filled with the wrinkling of a paper bag.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the past few weeks, I’ve been reflecting on questions of ethical and religious significance, predominantly in the context of South Asian literature and Hindu perspectives. My hope is that in some way or another, whether or not the topics of this column are in any way resonant with readers, they normalize further discussion about growth and discovery in the context of religion and ethical life. As I near the midpoint of my final undergraduate year, this final column is a cursory glance at a discovery I made in college, and the ways in which it has grown me.
The summer before I started college, I went on a road trip with my best friend from high school. What initially began as a plan to traverse the country, driving from St. Louis to Atlanta to Chicago to Toronto to San Jose, was eventually curtailed to St. Louis, Atlanta, and Chicago by our helicoptering parents, who were concerned about safety and our blustering youthfulness. In the end, we drove only from St. Louis to Atlanta and back to St. Louis; nothing was really as romantic as it seemed in the music videos.
This was partly because the road trip was for a specific purpose: to travel not simply in pursuit of freedom and friendship, but to see the guru of the particular Hindu sect to which our families belong. The guru, who was visiting from India, was stopping at temples in all the cities we had originally planned to visit, and we were going in tow of the celebrations and the religious services that would ensue. These services began as early as 5:30 a.m., and to really have a view of the stage where the morning prayers took place, you had to arrive around 4:30 a.m. In Atlanta, as it turned out, we were staying with my friend’s generous relatives in a house full of people who were also trying to make it to the temple early. So my friend and I would rise from our comforters on the floor around 2:30 a.m. to beat the traffic in the bathroom, breeze through our own prayers, and drive with scratchy eyes through the cool summer dawn to the temple, where we stayed until late night. The calendar exuberantly projected the end of this trip around my college move-in date, almost a month and a half later. We came home in a week, our zeal wrung clean out of us.
My friend and road trip companion had once written and mailed me an essay about why, after several teenage years flitting in and out of the religious community, she would go to college with a newly consecrated faith in God. She concluded by inviting readers to ask her more about it. “I’m not afraid to tell you,” she had written, a bold declaration at the end of a long essay with narrow margins and abundant exclamation marks. Despite a certain evanescence falling off the pages, it was one of the ripest modern understandings of God that I had ever read. I was thoroughly enamored by her and her spitfire, fiercely noble personality; I molded my relationship with religion after hers.
But college extended, in a way, the exhaustion I felt in Atlanta. It’s hard to pinpoint what changed and when in the coming months. I rarely saw her, and something about our convictions felt distant and inapplicable in the college world, where people believed so differently and so strongly that to insist on the truth of anything at all was to use shimmering cobwebs to hold back a ship. I called my friend less often and stopped leaving long messages in her voicemail. The tight twine of religion that held our friendship together finally let loose. I think she felt that too, because we never talked about that essay.
In college I began to study religion. I made my closest friends in Dharma, Harvard’s Hindu students’ organization, with whom I often discussed religion. To every one of these encounters, I brought with me a bit of her and the faith we shared: Seeing the best in people. Acceptance. Curiosity. Experiencing a living, loving God. A love of nature, of indie, folksy pop, of Christian worship music.
But from every single one of my encounters I also took something away: a realization that my tiredness was of waking up for a straight week at 2:30 a.m., and not of religion in general, which had always been, and continued to be, filling for me. A contempt for doing things for the optics. A discipline, a manner of practice that gave my days some structure. A reverence for the potency of a dissenting opinion. Most importantly, perhaps, a glimpse of a future where I can teach my children something of both worlds — of the unbridled impulse to road trip, the warmth and fellowship of a temple and its rituals, in addition to the quiet introspection, strident individualism, and courage required to assert belief.
My years in college have tempered those insular exclamations and universalizing flourishes, which felt so young and impractical. The mechanism by which this has happened: the power of discernment. I know now that I can take everything I have — from my beloved friend and our symbolically failed road tripping to my growing appreciation of Hindu literature and art, from my new close friends and daily practices to the wealth of my everyday experiences — and sift for joy and truth without doing away with any of it. I can know what makes me tired about religion without jumping on the bandwagon criticisms that are often levied against religious communities; I can know what and whom I would drive across the country to see without worrying about whether the front row will have filled up. The sifting isn’t just a fancy way of talking about convenient choices. It’s a way of making meaning even when the convictions don’t fit the context, because there is a commitment to shaping the context and not the conviction. It’s not a small thing to know what you want.
I have a photo of the two of us on the last day of our road trip, the day we drove back to St. Louis from Atlanta. I’m holding my phone, perhaps I’m setting up the navigation or getting ready to play some acoustic song. I don’t know what either of us expected of the future; all I know is that both of us were looking forward to getting some sleep. As a semester unlike any I have known coughs and sputters in its final moments, I, too, am looking forward to some rest.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We have spilled plenty of ink on how and when Harvard should engage in politics on a national scale, arguing that some statements which appear political in the context of our troubled times are really deeper moral stances, and we’ve encouraged Harvard to look past the political to consistently embrace the moral. A recent open letter, which calls on Harvard to develop accountability guidelines for inviting former members of President Donald J. Trump’s administration to campus, offers one model of this engagement. And though we appreciate that the letter calls attention to vitally important questions, we do not believe that a set of guidelines tailored narrowly to the Trump administration addresses the full scope of the issue. Furthermore, we are unconvinced that singling out a particular administration, even one we have criticized as regularly as this one, is the most productive approach for the long term.
First, to clarify some popular misconceptions: the open letter does not say that all Trump officials should be completely barred from becoming affiliated with Harvard, and pearl-clutching, dramatic attempts to garner pity, outrage, or even just attention by claiming otherwise and decrying the wild, unthinking, unnuanced illiberalism of Harvard’s progressive wing are hogwash, plain and simple. On planet reality, the letter calls for the development of accountability guidelines for high-level Trump appointees. But even so, the letter’s apparent intent to create a unique set of guidelines for former Trump administration officials feels improper. To be sure, among White Houses, this administration is unprecedented in its attempts to undermine and overturn the recent presidential election, and over the past four years, many of its policies have negatively impacted students — however, the Trump administration certainly doesn’t have a monopoly on immorality.
The letter does, however, raise an important point about the need for the University to vet all potential affiliates. Creating standards for who Harvard should hire or invite — regardless of who they are or who they support — would safeguard against impropriety among those who are allowed to distribute knowledge under the banner of “Veritas.” To be clear, this is not a partisan issue. In Harvard’s long history, it has welcomed some respectable conservative professors and speakers in the past, and some not-so-wonderful liberal ones as well. The Psychology Department visiting fellowship of convicted sex offender and charged sex trafficker Jeffrey E. Epstein is a prime example of what may happen when the University fails to do this. But, to the best of our knowledge, it is not written anywhere that immorality like this disqualifies someone from an invitation.
With this framework in mind, when the University considers Trump affiliates, it should not bar them, but nor should it grant them impunity. It seems obvious to us that officials involved in Trump’s attempt to overturn the results of the presidential election should be scrutinized carefully for their actions — but that doesn’t mean they should be entirely prohibited from invitations either.
When inviting speakers, the choices should be explicitly linked to what the Harvard community can gain from hearing the individual speak — the University or a given department should be able to clearly articulate what the speaker adds to the conversation. Further, this person must be committed to good-faith and open-minded discourse. That means tolerating and listening to conservative opinions, but it also means treating profound moral challenges raised by committed progressives as serious considerations, not the all-consuming din of an incoherent mob.
We’ll admit that establishing these “moral guidelines” is easier said than done. It would require us all to agree on what is egregious enough to disqualify a potential affiliate, and that’s tricky. But when we’re talking about who gets to disseminate knowledge on a stage as large as Harvard’s, these discussions are certainly worth having. Ensuring that professors, fellows, and speakers at Harvard will contribute positively to our community is an admirable goal, but it will not be achieved by creating a unique set of guidelines to apply a single administration.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In March, on the eve of leaving Cambridge, I asked a particularly wise friend of mine if he had any book recommendations for quarantine. Without missing a beat, he responded: “The Dialogues of Plato.” Plato, he told me, is a philosopher for times of crisis: a thinker who puts chaos in the context of the eternal. Later philosophers may have gotten more right, but few were better at sensing the underlying transcendence of reality.
Plato, of course, lived in his own time of upheaval: born in the wake of a plague that killed a quarter of Athens, he would live to see his city conquered by Sparta, and was himself later sold into slavery. But my friend was referring to the Dialogues’ content, not their historical context. In the world of the Dialogues, the physical universe is a mere shadow, a pitiful dilution of ultimate reality. Behind the chaos we encounter in everyday life, Plato maintains there subsists a timeless world of Forms — a heaven of unchanging objects corresponding to the changeable objects we observe below.
Among the most important of these Forms are the numbers. Each time we engage in mathematics, argues Plato, we rise up to the realm of Forms, where we encounter the Forms of numbers underlying their particular instantiations. When we recognize that two cats and two dogs each exemplify the number “two”, we do so by engaging with the Form of Two, an abstract, immaterial object present in each set of animals. And in communicating with this realm, we come to realize that we, too, are immaterial — immortal, eternal beings who will outlive our earthly shells.
Nowadays, many of us find it hard to take this kind of talk seriously. Prescientific generations had their excuse for fantastic theories, but we know better. In the palm of our hand, our smartphones have access to more information than history’s greatest libraries. Neuroscientists have mapped the brain and correlated parts of its activity to consciousness. Our best science references matter in motion, not minds or Platonic Forms. From this perspective, there’s simply no room for the transcendent in the modern world, no lacuna in our theories for the immaterial to slip in.
The assumption in this view is that modern science has made it difficult, even impossible to hold to ancient understandings of the transcendent. What’s fascinating is that nearly the opposite is true. In the last 100 years, developments in physics have reaffirmed the fundamentality of mathematics to the universe — and in a subtle way, pointed towards the centrality of consciousness.
When Plato argued that a hidden realm of numbers undergirded reality, he did so with thin empirical corroboration. Nowadays, the supporting evidence is overwhelming. Our physical theories plumb the depths of mathematics, relying crucially on group theory, complex analysis, and differential geometry in their formulations. Quantum field theorists plow through infinites to obtain predictions accurate to a part in a trillion. So great is our reliance on mathematics that Nobel Prize-winning physicist Eugene P. Wigner once termed its effectiveness “unreasonable,” while MIT physicist Max E. Tegmark deems it evidence that, despite appearances, the universe is really an abstract, mathematical structure — a Platonic view if there ever was one.
Nor has the advance of science crowded out an immaterial understanding of the mind. The orthodox formulation of quantum mechanics relies on the notion of a conscious observer to such a degree that several of its formulators, including Wigner, Erwin Schrödinger, and John von Neumann, simply concluded that consciousness was non-physical. And in recent writings, Christof Koch has arrived at the same conclusion on neuroscientific grounds, postulating that consciousness is a fundamental constituent of the universe. This view, known as “panpsychism,” has gained significant traction in the philosophical community, most notably through the writings of David Chalmers and Galen Strawson.
None of this is to argue we should be Platonists, or even that the views I’ve listed here are correct. In their details, most strike me as pretty implausible. But in our age of reflexive materialism, the trends implicit in these views should give us pause. If not developments in science, what accounts for our reluctance in appealing to the transcendent? What makes it so difficult to believe in what many of the ancients took for granted, when the evidence for their conclusions is stronger than ever?
In the rush of online classes, I never got to the Dialogues. But when I do, I’m hoping I’ll take them a little more seriously than before. It’s a chaotic world, and we could all use a little transcendence.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the world in the throes of a pandemic and a lockdown altering everyday methods of communication, students find themselves increasingly hooked on social media and grappling with the effects of hyperconnectivity.
The result is a boon for social media platforms. TikTok, a platform for sharing “personalized short videos” — as described by its website — has thrived during the COVID-19 pandemic. The app experienced a 27 percent increase in growth during the first 23 days of March compared to February. More than 25 U.S. states and territories had closed schools by mid-March.
Data for the daily use of six social media platforms — Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram TikTok, and YouTube — from The Crimson’s Class of 2024 freshman survey showed TikTok had the fewest number of users: 412 out of 840 respondents had an account. However, out of those who did have an account on a given platform, TikTok boasted the highest proportion— 43 percent — who reported spending on average more than one hour each day on it, followed by YouTube with 37 percent; and Instagram, with 27.4 percent.
Social media creators and users at Harvard said their social media consumption patterns have drastically increased under pandemic lockdown restrictions and impacted their well-being in a variety of ways.
In Apple’s list of most-downloaded apps for 2020, TikTok sits in second place, overshadowed only by Zoom.
Aurelia E. Balkanski ’23 said she found herself spending more time on TikTok once lockdown began, whereas she spent less time on Instagram, a change she said was motivated by the different content on the two platforms. Part of TikTok’s draw, she said, came from the videos all being less than one minute long, providing her with what she described as “quick, little, funny entertainment."
“I guess Instagram has their explore page, but it’s half ads and such — but with TikTok, it’s like watching TV, but there’s never a boring part of your show, you know,” Balkanski said. “The continuous access to videos makes it appealing. You never see the same thing twice – you’ll always be exposed to new people and new things and new stimuli.”
And the sheer breadth of content on TikTok ensures that users can find videos of interest no matter what they’re searching for. TikTok’s algorithm also creates a specially-curated, never-ending feed for users — and makes it possible for any video to go viral.
Yasmine Omri ’24 said she spends her time on niche genres of TikTok content that offer advice. She is not an active user of the platform, rather choosing to watch entertaining or “valuable” videos that were shared to other platforms in the form of YouTube compilations or Instagram posts.
“I’ve seen some TikToks of college YouTubers just explaining financial applications in really short TikToks, and some were explaining the Common App, and I was like, ‘Oh, that's super cool’,” Omri said.
Claira Janover ’20 made an account in April for her personal use. On June 5, her account suddenly took off after she posted a video supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, leading to "a little bit of a national scandal." As of Dec. 2, she had more than 460,000 followers on the platform.
“When COVID first broke out, I didn’t really think about TikTok at all — I made fun of people on it. And when more and more people started to do it, and send videos, was when I finally indulged,” Janover said. “It was something that I used mainly for fun — just had a blast with it.”
After being thrust into the limelight, she was forced to consider “social media behavior and psychology of engagement,” she said.
Similar to Balkanski, Janover noted that users are drawn to TikTok due to its algorithm and entertainment value.
“TikTok is randomized in a way that Instagram is not,” Janover said. “Growth on it is just so anyone can build, right? Just have a viral video. Versus Instagram, for example, where there’s no such thing as a viral post.”
The unpredictable nature of the TikTok feed has contributed to its success as an entertainment platform — in just four years, the platform has grown to reach an estimated value of $50 billion — and at the center is its prized algorithm, which keeps the user hooked on a never-ending stream of videos.
Any user’s feed can contain content from a wide variety of creators — regardless of whether or not the user follows those creators — that does not necessarily have to be recent. Unlike many other platforms, TikTok does not show when a video was posted, and the algorithm draws on content from further back.
Some students said they are convinced that TikTok has “gotten a little out of hand in how much cultural stake it has in our generation," said Karina L. Cowperthwaite ’23.
“Everyone’s on TikTok, everyone’s doing TikTok trends, everyone’s getting their news on TikTok,” she said. “I don’t know if I would cite TikTok as a reputable news source — but I do know people who do.”
For Tommaso Serafin ’24, joining TikTok and subsequently spending more time on social media was off the table.
“It seems that it would be a no-brainer to say that social media was helpful during a time in which people are locked in and everything, but I just feel it’s not that straightforward,” he said.
Despite TikTok’s ever-growing popularity, Serafin cited concerns about the addictive nature of TikTok’s notorious algorithm — adding that TikTok was “much worse” in terms of getting users addicted than its competitors — on top of data privacy issues. The app has garnered concern from some Americans about its data collection practices. President Donald J. Trump released an executive order in August that designated TikTok a national security concern because of its parent company's connections to China, setting in motion a ban that never came to fruition.
Beyond these concerns, some students have reported that social media is a depressing influence on their lives.
Serafin is an international first-year student living off-campus, which he believes exacerbated the “demoralizing” effect of seeing posts of people going out and possibly shirking COVID-19 restrictions.
“Once you contextualize stuff, it’s better. But in the moment, seeing that, it’s not really nice,” he said. “And that’s why I tried to cut back and not look at it.”
Some students, like Cowperthwaite, said that the “double-edged sword” of hyperconnectivity exacted by quarantine and lockdown measures has amplified the effect of social media on their self-image.
“You see people starting these cool projects over quarantine, or doing these remote internships, and I think there’s definitely a higher level of anxiety — at least for me personally — that ‘Oh my gosh, I’m not doing enough because I’m not physically out there doing anything’,” she said.
She added that young people are not just being subjected to greater pressure in this form from their peers during isolation, but that this was all still in the context of the “constant conversation” revolving around the presentation of beauty and lifestyle standards on social media.
“You’re more vulnerable to that persuasion when you’re sort of sitting at home on your phone,” Cowperthwaite said. “I personally find that detrimental to my mental health, because quarantine can be a dark hole where you feel very isolated and in your own head.”
Social media can create difficulty for people on both sides of the screen. John A. Fish ’21, who has been making YouTube videos for the past six years, attested to the strains creators feel.
“Quarantine’s been really difficult for a lot of people. And I’ve been really lucky that it hasn’t been horrible for me as it has been [for others]. But it’s been a hard time. And it’s kind of hard to make videos when, like, you’re not doing great,” Fish said.
He added, “The content that I make kind of relies on me, like, being curious and exploring ideas and, like, exercising that part of my brain for a while, at the start of the pandemic, I wasn’t doing that really. And I broke out of that a little bit. It’s gotten better, but it’s definitely affected [me].”
The creative block has come with its upsides. Fish said that because he puts out content less frequently, he is able to spend more time reflecting on his own life.
“I think it allowed me to be a little bit more introspective with what I want to be doing with my life, my career and who I want to be involving in that," he said.
While some students said they needed a break from these apps, others found social media to be an integral part of their communication with friends amid pandemic lockdown measures.
Fish said that because he lives in Canada, but his college friends live in the U.S., being on social media is a must “in order to get any semblance of a social life.”
Still, Fish said he tries to find the right balance for his social media use, ensuring that it is intentional and that he’s “actually connecting with my friends and family and not just scrolling infinitely through, you know, Trump’s Twitter or whatever.”
Time Magazine reported in May that 75 percent of Generation Z survey respondents said they “always or often” or “sometimes” felt more lonely because of the pandemic.
Some Harvard students said they used social media to fill this void.
Balkanski found that spending time on social media helped her fill the gaps left by face-to-face social interactions, saying that it “brings [her] joy to see those other people are having fun as long as they’re distancing”.
Akhila S. Yalvigi ’23 agreed and said that she appreciated “the feeling of being connected with people, even if it’s just in a superficial way”.
“Just knowing that people are on the other side of the screen was helpful for me, and I personally never really had any huge problems with the negative impacts of social media,” Yalvigi said. “Mostly, I tend to follow people that I know and follow my friends and everything, not necessarily buying into like influencer culture and engaging with that a lot.”
Cowperthwaite emphasized that for her, there was a distinction between using “social media” and “staying connected digitally."
“Calling your friends or doing Netflix Party or playing Among Us, or doing some kind of online activity, that has been really beneficial in terms of connecting with people online,” she said. “But in terms of social media, I did find myself deleting Instagram.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Student organizations hosted virtual panels and discussion groups to honor Native American Heritage Month throughout November.
Programming for Native American Heritage Month at the Institute of Politics began in October, forming part of a year-long initiative to mark a host of heritage months including Asian American Heritage Month, Black Heritage Month, and Latinx Heritage Month.
The IOP invited guest speakers — first delegate of a tribal nation to Congress Kimberly Teehee and Andrew Lee, who serves on the Board of Governors of the Honoring Nations awards at the Harvard Kennedy School — to its Nov. 18 panel “Fulfilling the Promise of a Treaty: Native Americans Claiming their Rights in the 21st Century.”
Teehee and Lee discussed Native American involvement in public service, self-governance, and the importance of alliance in alleviating issues facing Native American groups in the 21st century.
The Institute also hosted U.S. Rep. Debra A. Haaland (D-N.M.) Monday evening, who addressed issues of climate change, the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Native Americans, and her experience as one of the first two Native American women serving in Congress.
IOP Director of Diversity and Outreach Araoluwa Omotowa ’22 said organizers intended for the event to broaden representation in the Institute.
“Something that a lot of people have always felt was that they don't really see themselves reflected in the programming, or they’re like, ‘what about information about my community?’” Omotowa said. “So, in a lot of ways that kind of validation through representation has been one of the biggest objectives of this, and showing people again that who you are matters in this discussion as well.”
Alongside these events — each of which had roughly 200 attendees — the IOP also released email statements each Sunday last month to recognize land sovereignty and distribute resources on how people can help.
“We want to show people at the very basics like, ‘these people still exist, they still deserve to be heard, and they still deserve to have their problems cared about as much as anybody else’s, if not more because they’re suffering even more than others,” Omotowa said. “That draws back to the theme that this democracy is a project we all have to pitch into if we really care about equality in America.”
Jaidyn J. Probst ’23, Vice President of Natives at Harvard College, a student group on campus, said the Month marked a chance to underscore the importance of listening to Native voices, as well as individuals’ responsibility to educate themselves.
“Nobody should be forced to educate people on their historical trauma and past genocide,” Probst said. “In November, and all year round, you should be willing to listen to Native folks if they're willing to offer up information, but also take it into your own hands.”
The primary event for members of Natives at Harvard College was the “Indigenous Inspires Panel,” held on November 23. The group co-hosted the event with the College Events Board, Harvard University’s Native American Program, and the Harvard Political Union. It featured Native American advocates who spoke about Thanksgiving history and other contemporary issues in Indigenous communities.
Probst said events like these constitute an opportunity for non-Native people to learn about Native history.
“It's important for non-Native folks to recognize the history of Thanksgiving. It wasn't what many people are taught in school — it's a weighted holiday for a lot of Native folks,” Probst said.
Probst also noted her view that Harvard has unfinished work with regard to these issues. Citing the College’s acknowledgment of both Columbus Day and Indigenous Peoples’ Day, she said the College should “make racial diversity visible, but also not in a way that seems performative, and also in a way that's not being counteracted with a colonial structure.”
Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an email that as a federal research institution, the University recognizes both the “Federal and City and State calendar.”
“The Federal government recognizes Columbus Day, which is why our calendar reflects both,” wrote Dane.
Probst, Omotowa, and IOP President Maria L. “Mari” Jones ‘21 all said they hope the University will establish an Indigenous Studies or Ethnic Studies Program.
“Especially for undergrad, I think what’s important is just expanding our understanding of what it means to incorporate race, race theory, and race relations into academic study, where it's not something that has to be tokenized,” Jones said. “I think Harvard should really lead the charge in kind of reconciling what that looks like in an academic space.”
Dane referenced the Ethnic Studies cluster hire in response, noting the emphasis that Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay has “placed on the importance of this issue.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana discussed the administration’s planning process for next spring at a town hall for College affiliates Wednesday evening alongside other College administrators.
Harvard administrators announced yesterday afternoon that the College will aim to use all available bedrooms on campus next semester. Administrators will prioritize seniors, currently enrolled juniors, and students requiring special accommodations when inviting students back to campus.
The roughly hour-long town hall hosted over Zoom featured a panel consisting of Khurana, Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh, Dean of Students Katherine G. O'Dair, and Interim Cabot House Resident Dean Meghan Lockwood. Reaching just over 900 attendees at its peak, Wednesday’s town hall saw a significant reduction in attendance from June’s town hall on plans for the fall semester, which 2,000 affiliates attended.
Panelists took turns explaining different elements of the rationale behind the decisions outlined in Tuesday’s email announcement.
Khurana began the town hall by explaining the College’s decision to prioritize seniors and enrolled upperclassmen in inviting students back to on-campus housing.
“We were guided by our commitment to maintaining student academic progress,” Khurana said. “With many engaged in senior thesis projects or other capstone projects, the academic priority of seniors has always been clear, and consultation with our faculty during the fall revealed just how vital the junior year is in setting the stage for these activities.”
He acknowledged that the College’s prioritization of certain groups may have been poorly received by sophomores.
“I especially know how deeply disappointing this news must be for our sophomores, and their families,” Khurana said. “I share your disappointment. We share your disappointment.”
After Khurana’s introductory remarks, Claybaugh addressed the virtual experience enrolled students have had this semester and fielded questions from Khurana. Calling feedback from remote instruction “surprisingly good,” Claybaugh praised instructors and students alike for managing a semester of virtual learning.
“Our instructors and TFs have made heroic efforts to adapt their courses for this new mode of teaching, and our students, to say they have risen to the occasion would be to understate their accomplishment,” she said.
O’Dair then addressed testing procedures for next semester, as well as what students returning to campus could expect on-campus life to look like.
“For upper-class students who are returning, it's going to feel very different than when you were on campus last,” O’Dair said. “One of the changes we have made for the spring for students and residents is our plan to use a color-coded system for phases of campus reopening that provide either more or less access to facilities and programming based on public health conditions.”
O’Dair said campus dining halls would remain grab-and-go. She added that administrators intend to be more transparent and straightforward with affiliates about decisions and restrictions.
“I think we're really trying to be a little more clear with students about what the stages are and what they can expect,” O’Dair said. “We don't want surprises.”
Lockwood then addressed viral testing on campus and encouraged strict adherence to the community compact among returning students, adding that failure to do so could result in loss of housing eligibility.
During the panel discussion, Claybaugh conceded that many of the College’s plans remain subject to change due to the evolving nature of the ongoing health crisis.
“We will not know what is sensible to do, and we won't know even what we’re legally allowed to do until the semester starts,” Claybaugh said. “So, I can tell you that we are full of plans and hopes, but we cannot make any promises — this will all be dependent on what seems sensible from a public health point-of-view."

Center for Policing Equity co-founder Tracie L. Keesee spoke about using scientific methods to advance police reform at a Harvard Kennedy School event Wednesday.
Moderated by Kennedy School criminal justice professor Sandra Susan Smith and sociology professor Christopher Winship, the event was the latest in an ongoing speaker series on reimagining community safety organized by the Program in Criminal Justice Policy and Management, which Smith leads as faculty director.
Wednesday’s event focused on the Center for Policing Equity’s core mission of achieving “justice through science.” The Center — for which Keesee currently serves as Senior Vice President of Justice Initiatives — spearheads research collaborations between law enforcement and social scientists to better serve local communities.
Drawing from her 25 years of law enforcement experience in the Denver Police Department, Keesee emphasized the idea of co-production — the practice of community members collaborating in the creation of public policy — as a tool for more equitable policing.
“If you bring people with their lived experiences into these spaces, including the police, including experts that do the work that police shouldn’t be doing, it helps to produce a different knowledge, a different perspective, a different way to do this work,” Keesee said, referencing late political economist Elinor C. Ostrom who coined the term co-production.
“It is one in which the power is really moved away from police,” she added.
Keesee cited activist Erica Ford’s work as the co-founder of LIFE Camp, an organization dedicated to violence intervention programs in the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens, New York, as a successful example of co-production. LIFE Camp is the first responder to violent crises in the area, a system made possible not only by its relationship to the community, but also to the police department.
“You have to be able to have that recognition that the community preference is to have a community response,” she said. “And those folks that are there are part of the community, they understand what’s going on, they understand what trauma looks like.”
Keesee spoke about the unique nature of the status quo, in which widespread protests for police reform in 2020 have briefly disrupted forms of centralized power. Despite the opportunity, she said these authority structures have already begun regaining power.
“One of the bigger concerns I have is that it feels as if there will only be a window — and a short window — to try to get something done,” she said. “And at that point, you will start to see those who typically hold the power begin to pull that back.”
In light of the short time frame, Keesee highlighted the importance of prioritizing sustainable and long-lasting change.
“There is a tremendous amount of concern not only about what can we do to make sure that these things stay centered the way they should be,” she said, “But how do you sustain it?”
Keesee also discussed the potential implications of defunding or abolishing the police, and questioned how the large number of individuals employed at the police force would find jobs or use their skills elsewhere.
“If there’s not a role for police, what are you going to do with all of these folks?” she asked. “Do you retrain them and move them into something different?”
One way to reach a consensus about policing reform, Keesee argued, is to advocate that equitable and reduced policing is not only advantageous for a specific population, but for everybody involved and that co-production is not the only method of achieving police reform.
“With co-production, it’s not meant to be the only solution, nor is it the ultimate solution,” Keesee said. “But it is one along that way if we’re trying to get to a space where that power does shift permanently.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui said the city is in the process of determining the most efficient strategies to disseminate coronavirus vaccines, as the country prepares to embark on a mass vaccination campaign unseen in decades.
A vaccine developed by Moderna Therapeutics — a Cambridge-based biotechnology company — as well as another by Pfizer, Inc. and BioNTech await approval from the Food and Drug Administration, after initial data showed both are roughly 95 percent effective in preventing COVID-19.
“We've been thinking ahead on a lot of this as a city about, you know, we're doing a flu clinic and COVID drive-thru clinic — when the vaccine is available, how do we utilize existing structures?” Siddiqui said.
Though the city of Cambridge has begun ideating on vaccine distribution, Siddiqui said it is still too early for cities to begin playing a key role in the coordination of vaccine circulation.
“It's a federal issue, and it’s a state issue,” Siddiqui said. “I think where municipalities ultimately play a role will be after these guidelines are made about who should be getting the vaccine first and so forth. The city and others will then take a look at these recommendations and then go from there.”
Siddiqui added that she made a request to the Cambridge Department of Public Health to inquire about the appointment of a vaccine task force to help with vaccine distribution.
“I asked the Health Department to appoint a vaccine task force, in addition to what the state has,” she said. “I think it's important that the municipality also has one, as we figure out these plans.”
Since the first doses of a coronavirus vaccine are slated to be released later this month, the Cambridge City Council will have to solidify its vaccine distribution plans quickly.
The unprecedented speed at which Moderna — along with the Pfizer and BioNTech collaboration — was able to develop its vaccine can largely be attributed to a new vaccine technology that uses messenger RNA. Unlike traditional vaccines which typically use weakened or inactivated versions of a live virus, mRNA vaccines instruct cells to produce a harmless protein unique to the targeted virus that the body can then recognize.
Willy C. Shih, a Harvard Business School professor who researches manufacturing operations in science-based businesses, said this mRNA technology has significantly streamlined the process of manufacturing mass quantities of the vaccine.
“What Moderna has to do is they have to manufacture large quantities of the mRNA, but they don't have to put them inside another viral vector,” Shih said. “Rather they just deliver the mRNA, so the manufacturing overhead or the efforts to manufacture is much simpler because you're handling much smaller amounts of material.”
Moderna expects to have 20 million doses of its vaccine available in the United States by the end of 2020, and 500 million to one billion doses globally in 2021, according to the company’s website.
“They've already received a lot of money from Operation Warp Speed to help them with their clinical trials, helping them scale up manufacturing,” Shih said. “There are a lot of what are called contract manufacturing organizations who are already at work, and most of the vaccine manufacturers will combine their own facilities as well as go out to contract manufacturers.”
The Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee of the FDA will meet on Dec. 17 to discuss Moderna’s request for emergency use authorization — one week after its discussion of the same request made by Pfizer and BioNTech.

The vast majority of us will be spending reading period off campus this year. Without the neurotic ambiance of Lamont Library or the 3 a.m. review grind in the dhall, how can we still tap into our peak potential and pull off effective cramming during an important time? Here are some Flyby-approved tips to successfully recreate the reading period environment at home.
Enclose yourself
Contained spaces and cubicle desks can be very conducive for effective study sessions, and you don’t have to be in a library to have such trappings. Simply maneuver your desk so that it faces a blank wall, and put up dividers (i.e. cardboard and tape) to limit your peripheral vision. Finally, stick a lamp in front of you, and you’re good to go.
Follow along a “study with me” YouTube video
Some YouTubers get subscribers from gaming, others rake up followers with study videos. These concentration gods often make multi-hour videos in which they film themselves working in an appropriate environment, usually with suitable music playing in the background. With built-in “study pauses” meant to boost brain stamina, you could truly belt out some deadly efficient study sessions.
Space out the mental boosters
While Flyby does not encourage consumption of copious amounts of caffeine, these substances are sometimes necessary to pull off last-minute cramming before crucial final exams. One of the worst things you could do is drinking multiple caffeinated beverages on an empty stomach. Instead, drink your servings over a longer period of time, eat decent meals while consuming caffeine, and try to avoid the sugary energy drinks.
Stay connected with your friends online
Isolating oneself during a rather stressful time doesn’t always pan out well. Remember to check in with your buddies and hit them up when there’s a lull in the cramming process. And depending on your study preferences, set up Zoom sessions where you can engage in the re-learning together! Sure, it’s going to be lame compared to actually being together on campus, but at least you’ll have virtual camaraderie.
A reading period without the safety net of SAT/UNSAT grades is definitely going to be a challenge, but remember to take care of yourself and good luck!
