After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The discovery that $2,000 was spent on the tab of the Republican National Committee at Voyeur West Hollywood, an exclusive lesbian-bondage-themed nightclub in Los Angeles, is only the latest in a long line of ridiculous scandals that have broken out under the questionable leadership of RNC Chair Michael Steele. While Steele was not personally responsible for this particularly embarrassing expenditure, his tenure has been generally characterized by childish extravagance and gaffes that put even Vice President Biden to shame.
Some may remember that Steele, the first African American party chair, was elected by members of the RNC over paler selections like South Carolina RNC Chair Katon Dawson or Michigan RNC Chair Saul Anuzis, for what some considered to be racial reasons. Many believed that the party’s logic was as follows: The pick of an African American like Steele or former Ohio Secretary of State Kenneth Blackwell, in the wake of President Obama’s historic election, could mitigate the growing perception of the Republican Party as composed of Southern white males. This alleged belief that appointing a black spokesperson could resolve minority qualms with the party—as if the only reason why minorities are not receptive to the Republican brand is poor messaging, rather than fundamental policy differences—was highly misguided. It is only just, therefore, that the RNC has suffered so much unintentional humiliation at the hands of the man they appointed out of what seem to be ulterior motives.
Almost immediately upon his selection, Steele proceeded to put his foot in his mouth, selling his vision of a more pluralistic GOP in offensively stereotypical racial terminology. His greatest hits include boasting of his “off the hook” plan to reach out to “urban-suburban hip-hop settings,” offering to woo blacks into the party with “fried chicken and potato salad,” and saying President Obama’s stimulus program “is just a wish list from a lot of people who have been on the sidelines for years…to get a little bling, bling.”
But even when not invoking ethnic stereotypes, Steele’s uncontrollable logorrhea has never failed to undermine the Republican message. For example, during the debate of the Democrats’ stimulus plan, Steele audaciously proclaimed that “You and I know that in the history of mankind and womankind, government—federal, state, local, or otherwise—has never created one job. It’s destroyed a lot of them. It’s hampered a lot of them.” This is a curious statement considering that the very job that Steele ran for in 2006—United States senator from Maryland—was a government job.
But if Steele’s gaffes were his only failings, perhaps there would be a lot less talk about removing him from his position as RNC chair. Under Steele’s chairmanship, spending on frivolities like limousines, catering, and even flowers for extravagant events at pricy hotels has doubled, and, in a much-criticized move, the annual winter meeting of the RNC was relocated from Washington to a resort in Hawaii. “Bondage-gate” may be more colorful than these other misallocations of donor funds, but it is far from being the first or even the most wasteful example of recent RNC profligacy.
But, there is a uniquely hypocritical aspect of this latest scandal. As the self-proclaimed party of the traditional family, and with many Republican office-holders owing their positions in large part to the RNC, it is duplicitous for Republicans to campaign on moral values while taking funds from a committee guilty of such exotic debauchery. And in the wake of the sex scandals of Nevada Senator John Ensign and South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford, it appears doubly hypocritical. This behavior does not exemplify the values of the Republican base.
While the Democratic Party is also guilty of similar behavior, including the Democratic National Committee’s own, milder profligacy and the groping scandal of former New York Congressman Eric Massa, the Democrats do not profess to be the vanguard of traditional values and fiscal responsibility. For their own good, therefore, Republicans ought to urge the RNC to remove Michael Steele and replace him with someone better able to exemplify the qualities they wish to sell to voters.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A few weeks ago, I saw someone naked.
Accidentally.
I was standing in the Eliot courtyard, and a friend was pointing out his room to me when I happened to see someone standing right smack dab in a dorm window—100 percent in the nude. Now, to be clear, I didn’t intend in the slightest to see any of this, but once you have seen something like that it’s hard to pretend it never happened. Unfortunately, incidents like these are far too common at Harvard, because much of the student body seems not to realize that their actions inside their rooms leak into and affect the outside world.
Although keeping the shades up during the day is a nice way to enjoy the scenery that Harvard has to offer, at night it might be best to keep the shades drawn. For all those non-physics majors out there, it is in fact much easier for someone to see into a bright room at night than it is for you to see out of it. Think about Taylor Swift and the guy next door checking each other out every night in her music video, “You Belong With Me.” It’s nice that it worked out for them, but it could have been very different if Taylor was creeped out by the guy next door. And remember, just because you can’t see someone doesn’t mean they can’t see you.
And we Harvard students affect more than just our peers here; we affect the general public. What about the tourists? I don’t know about you, but nothing wakes me up more than seeing a tourist peer into my window at 10 in the morning when I’m half dressed. In their innocent quest to get the “inside scoop” on Harvard, tourists often get much more than they bargained for.
Besides disturbing images, noise also escapes dorm rooms. Walk down past the River Houses on a weekend night and you can tell where the parties are. Just listen. When big parties get all hot and muggy and people start throwing open every window they can find to get some air in there, they seem to forget that things can go out the window too—like sound. I went to a party in Leverett House last week, and without knowing the exact room number, I knew where I was headed because Lady Gaga and Sean Kingston had announced the party to me a block down the road. For the vast majority of passer-bys—who were not trawling for a random party that night—the music would have been a significant disturbance.
For those of us lucky enough to have our own bathrooms, check out those walls. Yeah, they’re thinner than a Gov course pack. The next time you start hearing voices while you’re doing your thing in the bathroom, don’t worry, it’s not in your head. To some people, talking through bathroom walls might be a nice way of getting to know the people next door, but I know I like some privacy in there. Oh, and to the girl in the dorm next door, if you’re going to sing in the shower, please pick something good! If I hear “Party in the USA” while I’m shaving one more time I might nick myself, and it would be your fault.
So Harvard, next time you decide to do something embarrassing in your room, like jumping around at 2 a.m., blasting music, or wearing your old pajamas, remember that you should be respectful of your potential audience. Being a Harvard student already feels like you’re on display whenever you walk through the Yard; don’t let that continue in your dorm room. Unless you want to put on a show, though; it’s your choice. Tonight however, I’ll be pulling down my shades.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Harvard Square station, the printed motto of the United Services Organizations, the “bridge” between the American public and its military overseas, demands attention with its simple message: “USO: Until Every One Comes Home.” For decades and for the foreseeable future, this motto will remain. In today’s political reality, if you serve a world power, you can’t go home again.
The “War on Terror” marches on—and so do American soldiers. The United States has currently transported only a small amount of the 30,000 troops reassigned to Afghanistan from duty in Iraq. While one may find comfort in the simple fact that the situation in Iraq remains stable enough that American withdrawal can continue, the situation in Afghanistan provides no such cause for even cautious optimism. With President Hamid Karzai, the United States has likely created a monster it can neither easily control nor destroy. One cannot reasonably expect a day without U.S. troops in Afghan territory to come soon. As a global superpower, the U.S. will also continue to maintain personnel in Europe, Central America, and East Asia.
Yet, the United States has company in its overseas efforts. Scan the U.N. Security Council and one will find that the leaders of global security are also the leaders of messy military operations outside their borders and violence at home. The usual suspects are the Security Council’s permanent members: the United States, Russia, China, France, and the United Kingdom. Each nation has troops serving as occupying forces outside its borders, and each has faced internal violence.
A week ago, Moscow was rocked by two suicide bombings—one, at least, carried out by a militant’s widow only 17 years old.  The reactions of Russian citizens to these bombings remind me of the conflicted emotions New Yorkers like myself experienced in 2001. Unlike 9/11, however, these recent attacks appear to have been carried out by rebels in an ongoing war. For long, bloody years, Russia has deployed troops and fought Muslim insurgents in Chechnya and the other states of the north Caucasus region (the southernmost part of Russia). In the fallout of last Monday’s attacks, Russians spoke bitterly of the state propaganda that had informed the Russian public that fighting in the Caucasus was lessening and confined to that territory alone. Instead, bombings returned to Moscow, and the situation in the southern republics was exposed as less stable than claimed.
Russia is only the latest in a string of Security Council members facing such bombings. France, mocked at Harvard for its impotence in geopolitical debate and rugby practices, actually maintains a strong and active military—which perhaps flies under the radar because its main activities occur in Africa. France remains heavily involved in peacekeeping in Africa, as well as in shocking activities such as possible rapes by French soldiers during the Rwanda genocide. Within France’s borders, an African terrorist bombed the Paris Metro 15 years ago.
The United Kingdom supports NATO operations and the United States’ war on terror, with its military operating throughout the world, albeit on a smaller scale than its American allies. In 2005, the bombings ,known to British citizens as “7/7,” rocked London’s underground transport system and one bus, injuring hundreds.
China has not experienced underground bombings, but its troops maintain an active, violently opposed occupation in Tibet. Of the current non-permanent members, only one nation, Gabon, does not have a legacy of external and internal violence. Notably, Nigeria has played an active role in military operations throughout Africa, even sending troops to the Balkans, while Bosnia and Herzegovina and Lebanon have faced crippling internal violence. India, arguably the most powerful non-Security Council state, experienced the horror of the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks. South Korea remains locked in its military faceoff with its northern neighbor, and it appears North Korean forces sank a South Korean ship with a torpedo two weeks ago.
Right down the line, the nations of the U.N. Security Council seem bound by a commonality of violence. Include India and South Korea, and one must face a grim realization: Global power does not come peacefully. Once could attempt to explain such a disturbing pattern by arguing that power inherently causes, or resolves, conflict. Yet, a Security Council to maintain global peace could perhaps serve its mission better if its members did not actively occupy and carry out military actions outside their borders.
One cannot reasonably expect Russia to surrender its stake in the Caucasus, or American and Chinese troops to simply walk away from Afghanistan and Tibet. But, the accounts of the survivors of the Moscow bombings serve as a stark warning for we the citizens of the Security Council powers: As long as the militaries of the security powers fight outside their borders, their homelands cannot be safe from retribution within.

Make no mistake about it: Change has come to America. When President Obama signed the health-care bill into law, our country came one step closer to a more perfect union—one step closer to the ideals of equal opportunity and social justice. This bill is our victory—not as Democrats, but as students. When our campus voted overwhelmingly for Barack Obama in November of 2008, we voted for hope, and we voted for change. Now, more than ever, there is cause for both.
Talking to voters in the last election cycle, our members heard tragic stories about the damage caused by a broken system. From New Hampshire to Florida, from Pennsylvania to Colorado, we met Americans of all ages who didn’t have health insurance, or who couldn’t afford the coverage they had. There were too many mothers who feared that their child’s medical condition would force them into bankruptcy. There were too many fathers who worried about what would happen to their coverage when they lost their job in a failing economy. And there were too many students who were concerned about their future—who did not know if they would be able to afford health insurance once they graduated. The health-care bill was a victory for all of the above.
Without a doubt, the bill’s immediate effects are especially significant for young Americans. Last week, in compliance with the new law, insurance companies announced their intention to eliminate restrictions on children 18 and under with pre-existing health conditions, such as asthma. In addition, coverage for more than seven million children in low-income families who receive health-care from the Children’s Health Insurance Program will be shielded until 2019 from the fiscal pressures facing state governments.
And what if you, your siblings, parents, or friends fall ill? Before this reform, parents’ insurance plans could deny coverage to dependent children after their 18th birthday. Now, parental plans cover children until they turn 26. Before this reform, some healthcare policies allowed insurance companies to discontinue coverage for sick patients. Some plans even capped the amount companies would pay for your medical expenses. Two weeks ago, these practices were effectively brought to an end. Under this bill, even adults with pre-existing conditions will be eligible to join a high-risk coverage pool funded by the government. Considering that 45,000 Americans die every year because they lack affordable health care, it is hard to overstate the significance of this bill for millions of families across this country. This bill will quite literally save lives.
Yet the bill that President Obama signed into law has implications for you beyond the health sector. The Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act—an addition to the healthcare bill—enables students to receive loans directly from the federal government. This will cut out the middleman, providing a savings of $61 billion over 10 years and vastly improving student life. These provisions will allocate more resources to students eligible for Pell Grant scholarships and to universities nationwide. In short, higher education has become more accessible and more affordable for millions of Americans.
Taken together, reform of the healthcare system and the expansion of student aid are two major strides towards establishing a more equitable society. For students especially, this bill will grant new opportunities and eliminate unjust barriers to success. All Americans should be able to afford a college education; all Americans should be protected against medical catastrophe. It’s just that simple.
Of course, we’re not there yet. In terms of health care specifically, the passage of this bill represents not the conclusion, but the beginning of a lengthy process to provide high quality care and eliminate wasteful spending. Yet after decades of failed attempts to fix this critical institution, our political system has proven itself capable of contending with complex issues—even in the face of diverging interests. Now, we must bring that system to bear on the next big issue of our time—whether it be financial reform, immigration, or climate change. It is our responsibility as students to continue to elect motivated representatives who are passionate about progressive change—who will fight for our values and our ideals in our nation’s capital.  While the march toward progress is often slow and frustrating, the American government—with the active participation of its constituents—can and will create a better tomorrow.

Though the University’s chief fundraiser reported an adverse effect on gift receipts compared to last year, University donors said last week that the current dip in numbers may not necessarily indicate weakened support for Harvard’s upcoming capital campaign.
“I would say that the economic downturn has had an effect of increased caution in the fundraising environment, and that would be true  of our peers as well,” said Vice President for Alumni Affairs and Development Tamara E. Rogers ’74. “But while it has been a more challenging year thus far than last year, alumni continue to be tremendously loyal.”
Rogers declined to release any figures in an interview last week.
University President Drew G. Faust said last month that Harvard is currently soliciting feedback from its constituents for possible fundraising priorities and themes in preparation for a long-delayed capital campaign—a type of sustained fundraising drive that the University has not engaged in since 1999.
Faust added that highlighting certain themes that resonate with donors would be key to a successful campaign.
One prominent donor said that institutions like Harvard have a special staying power—unlike many non-profit organizations that have struggled this past year in raising funds—a factor that bodes well for a coming campaign.
“People love these institutions. They want to support them—they almost want an excuse to support them,” said Gifford Combs ’80, who has in the past solicited donations for the Harvard University Library. “You just have to have a story to tell them, and they’ll sign up.”
The precipitous $11 billion drop in Harvard’s endowment in the fiscal year ending 2009—and perceptions of financial of financial mismanagement—has not severely shaken the confidence of the University’s prominent donor base.
“The donor community that I know, they believe in Harvard—they’ve been up, and they’ve been down,” said John A. Armstrong ’56, who has endowed a professorship in engineering and applied sciences. “I think it’s highly unlikely that their commitment to Harvard has been affected.”
A tough economic climate may also present particularly wealthy donors with opportunities for giving. Low interest rates during a recession make an investment vehicle known as a charitable annuity trust particularly attractive because it allows donors to pass on money to their heirs and the University at low tax rates, according to one prominent donor who asked to remain anonymous to preserve his relationship with the University.
University fundraisers have encouraged this option as a means to support Harvard as well as secure retirement and lower tax burdens in their spring 2009 publication.
But Combs cautioned against overestimating donations and emphasized the importance of a strong message from the University as it seeks to bring in gifts in a weak economy.
“I think one should not underestimate the effect of the economy on donors,” he said. “No matter how much you may love your alma mater, the economy is the reality you have to deal with when you’re writing a check.”

Almost three months after the 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck Port-au-Prince, Haiti, the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative is asking for more donations.
In an e-mail sent on Thursday to its partners and affiliates, HHI warned that the Fond Parisien Disaster Recovery Center, a field hospital on Haiti’s side of the border with the Dominican Republic, is at risk of closing.
HHI—the University-wide academic and research organization for response to humanitarian crises—has been coordinating efforts with other Harvard organizations since the earthquake’s onset. Now, the University’s initial wave of response to on-site relief seeks renewed financial interest.
“It’s gotten to the point [where] we can’t rely on donated time for the life of the rehabilitation center that we’re running,” said Vincenzo Bollettino, director of programs and administration at HHI.
All the Harvard doctors who have flown to the island to help the relief effort have paid for their own flights, Bollettino said.
And though the Disaster Recovery Center has already treated over 1200 patients, more funds are needed to pay staff—over 100 local employees—as well as to procure pharmaceuticals and other medical supplies.
“It’s the monetary [donations] that we really need,” Bollettino said. “But those won’t last forever either.”
Aside from receiving personal and corporate gifts, HHI has also applied for grants from the United Nations crisis relief fund and the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance, Bollettino said. Although the foundations have been encouraging, no grants have yet been formally given.
In the meantime, the actual relief effort at the Disaster Recovery Center—the largest field hospital in Haiti—has been cited by the media as the best run of its kind, Bollettino said.
Surgical work has been aided by the U.S. Navy Ship Comfort, for example, which has performed many surgeries offshore before the patients are sent to the Disaster Recovery Center for rehabilitation.
Still, HHI needs more money “so that we can at least bridge the cost of running this facility until a larger donor comes in,” Bollettino said.
All donations are tax deductible, and any donation amount will be “immediately useful on the ground,” the e-mail stated.

The Harvard Faculty Club closed last Tuesday due to several reports of possible norovirus infections from its patrons, despite earlier signs of possible norovirus contamination.
After the Club closed, the University and Cambridge Public Health Department took over investigations.
“If they knew that something was amiss as early as Saturday, why did they keep serving food? I think that’s the real issue,” wrote Phoebe Kosman, a publicist for Harvard University Press in an e-mail to The Crimson.
Crista Martin, Harvard University Dining Services director for marketing and communications, said that several guests first reported feeling ill on March 27, according to an article in The Boston Globe.
But these viral outbreaks were not limited to Harvard’s campus. Emerson College had reported 75 cases of similar symptoms up until last Thursday, a Globe article said.
Terry Stackhouse, a student at Emerson College, said in an e-mail to The Crimson that he felt sick when he was on live radio and had to leave his show to vomit during one of the breaks.
At the peak of the norovirus outbreak at Emerson late last month, about 10 to 13 students per day went to the medical center for symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, said Andrew Tiedemann, Emerson’s vice president for communications and marketing, in an interview with The Globe.
Norovirus infects the small intestines, causing stomach pain, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting.
Inspectors from the Boston Public Health Commission’s Infectious Disease Bureau recommended measures to contain the spread of the disease including urging students and faculty members to wash their hands and not share food utensils.

In an unconventional twist on final exams, students in this semester’s English 156, “Crime and Horror in Victorian Literature and Culture” will find themselves conveying their academic insights not only through their word processors, but also face-to-face with teaching staff in an oral final exam.
The recently announced oral exam  will require students to choose one text from a list of supplementary readings to discuss aloud with a member of the teaching staff. According to English Professor Matthew B. Kaiser, who teaches the course, the oral format of the test is meant to exercise some “neglected intellectual muscles;” namely, students’ ability to engage in scholarly dialogue.
“Students who have read little or attended lecture sporadically will have a lot less to say and will not be able to produce compelling conversation,” Kaiser wrote in an e-mail.
Though some concentrations, such as Social Studies and History and Literature, already include oral examinations as part of their degree requirements, Kaiser’s decision is likely part of a larger trend in the College aiming to expand students’ communication skills beyond the traditional focus on writing.
The recent approval of the course into the General Education curriculum was one such motivating factor for this change, Kaiser said.
According to Gen Ed Committee member and Psychology Professor Mahzarin R. Banaji, one of the goals of the Gen Ed committee is encouraging faculty to think about “non-traditional” methods of teaching.
Banaji said it is important to “push the boundaries” in order to find the most effective pedagogical methods.
Concurrently, the English department is trying to make public speaking a “more central component” of undergraduate education, according to Kaiser.
“Students often complain that they don’t acquire interviewing skills during their time in college,” Kaiser wrote in an e-mail. “We’re trying to address that problem.”
Unconventional forms of assessment, though still uncommon, are being seen in other Harvard classes as well.
Culture and Belief 11, “Medicine and the Body in East Asia and in Europe” is another Gen Ed course that has traded traditional writing assignments in favor of weekly, student-produced podcasts or short videos relating to the assigned readings.
Head teaching fellow Robert Joseph “R.J.” Jenkins wrote in an e-mail that he hopes courses continue to help students develop a more diverse set of skills beyond academic writing.
“Helping students improve their ability to express themselves verbally is a goal shared by faculty and teaching fellows, academic departments and College administrators,” he said.

Law students, legal rights activists, government officials, and interested individuals from around the globe gathered at Harvard Law School for the fifth annual Harvard Lambda Legal Advocacy Conference, “Diverse Sexualities/Disparate Laws: Sexual Minorities, the State, and International Law.”
The conference featured panels examining a range of issues on how the law can help or hinder sexual minorities. Panelists discussed issues such as sodomy criminalization, same-sex marriage, asylum for sexual minorities under refugee law, and perspectives on lesbians’ rights, women’s rights, and sexual rights.
“There have been great developments for sexual minorities around the globe, but there is much work to be done,” said Mina E. Khalil, co-chair of the conference and political co-chair of HLS Lambda. “We’re bringing together people from all over the world with the aim of collaboration across national and disciplinary boundaries.”
The panel entitled “Transnational Perspectives on Transgender Movements” particularly emphasized this goal of collaboration.
“Transgender identity is often artificially separated from gay identity,” said Shannon P. Minter, Legal Director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, who spoke at the panel. “The bifurcation of those two movements is a significant problem for trans legal activism internationally.”
Lohana Berkins, founder of the Fight for Transvestite and Transsexual Identity Association in Argentina, said that she has observed similar divisions, which are often intensified by the low visibility of transgender people in Latin America.
“There are two or three well-known activists and no one else,” she said. “The priority is gaining visibility, getting together and finding a common agenda.”
But transgender issues are even less visible in East Africa, according to Victor J. Mukasa, a Program Associate at the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission.
“Our stories as transgender people have gotten mixed up with gay and lesbian stories,” Mukasa said. “In Uganda, where I’m from, they only know sexual orientation, and if anyone biologically female presents themselves as male, then they are definitely a lesbian.”
Mukasa said that groups such as IGLHRC are making connections with gender activist groups in Africa to define an African trans movement.
“We are all human beings and we all deserve to have our human rights respected,” Mukasa said. “The issues affecting us are too much for us alone, and we have to work in collaboration with one another.”
The panelists agreed that while there has been increasing visibility and new venues for collaboration between various LGBT activist groups in recent years, the fight for more legal rights must continue.
“It’s difficult to talk about transgender identity without having to talk about violence, discrimination, and a lot of other hardships,” Berkins said. “We want to change that.”

Eight undergraduates presented lectures on eight topics ranging from modern-day slavery to Renaissance architecture before an audience that filled the Adams House Pool Theater last Friday.
This second event in the Harvard Student Lecture Series was organized by the Harvard Diggers Society, a group that promotes student expression and ideas. The Society contests what founding member Talia B. Levin ’12 describes as a “culture of intellectual exclusivity” at Harvard.
Alexandra A. Petri ’10 opened the event with a comedic burst, asking the audience to pick the side of a coin to determine whether she would deliver a lecture on fan fiction or salmon, ultimately lapsing into quips about high school prom.
Kristin N. Rose ’12 delivered a lecture entitled “Feminists Have Better Sex,” touching on issues ranging from contraceptives to the definitions and misconceptions of feminism.
Lange P. Luntao ’12 presented his thoughts on multiracial social communities, sharing about his own half-Asian identity and identifying the event as a space “to get light bulbs set off in our heads.”
Peter D. Davis ’12, another Diggers founding member, said that the group provides opportunities for students to communicate their different passions in an encouraging environment.
“We knew we were onto something with the concept of finding things that could bring Harvard students together, bring us out of our little segmented, compartmentalized, Harvard subcultures together into a unified intellectual community,” he said.
Davis and Levin were part of a group of friends who gathered this past fall to organize an undergraduate-led lecture series, best described as a student reincarnation of Harvard Thinks Big. Levin emphasized that people of all backgrounds
are welcome to join the Harvard Diggers Society, which has been advertised as a group requiring “NO comp. NO application. NO ticket charge.”
Levin said the Diggers Society started planning the second of the Harvard Student Lecture Series before January Term, envisioning an event that would promote self-definition and spark student dialogue free from “intellectual intimidation.”
After pulling in a larger crowd with their second lecture event last Friday, Davis said he hopes the Diggers Society can become an institution that experiments with events ranging from student lectures to cultural exchanges.
“We’re just interested working together on community-building and expression-enabling projects for Harvard—and having a good time while doing it,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Thirty-four of the 100 most influential figures in corporate governance are affiliated with Harvard Law School, according to a review by Directorship Magazine.
The Directorship 100 List, published annually, compiles “the who’s who of the corporate governance community” and the “most influential people in the boardroom,” according to the magazine, a publication aimed at the directors of public companies.
Directorship’s 2009 list includes President Barack Obama, a 1991 graduate of the Law School, Congressman Barney Frank ’61 (D-Mass.), a 1977 Law School graduate, and Senator Charles E. Schumer ’71 (D–N.Y.), a 1974 Law School graduate.
The majority of Harvard’s affiliates on the list are part of the Law School’s Forum on Corporate Governance.
“The work that the forum has done is very thoughtful and makes you reconsider your own views,” said H. Rodgin Cohen ’65, a 1968 Law School graduatewho was included in list.
Cohen, former chairmen of the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, has advised the boards of many financial institutions on risk management this past year. Cohen was called the “trauma surgeon of Wall Street” by The New York Times in November.
“The forum is probably the premier forum for discussion about corporate governance issues,” said Robert J. Giuffra, a partner at Sullivan & Cromwell, who was also recognized.
Giuffra said he became involved in the forum after working on a corporate governance case with Law School professor Lucian A. Bebchuk, who was also on the list. Bebchuk attended the Law School for both his doctorate and master’s degrees.
As a non-partisan institution, the board of the Law School’s corporate governance forum does not take positions on current issues.
“I think this decision facilitates the objective of the forum,” Cohen said. “It should be a place to debate and for people to learn. It is far more about educating than proselytizing.”
Holly J. Gregory, also included on the list, is a regular contributor to the forum and a corporate partner at the Weil, Gotshal & Manges law firm.
“The forum has been an excellent collection point for writing in the field,” Gregory said. Gregory said she reads the forum’s blog frequently.
Gregory said the forum’s neutral stance allows it to draw on people in the field with very different viewpoints.
“If it took a position on something, it would no longer be a broad-based group,” Giuffra said. “When a group is narrow and has an agenda, then people will not want to be a part of it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
MIT Professor Paula T. Hammond was honored as Scientist of the Year at the Harvard Foundation’s Albert Einstein Science Conference last Friday.
On Saturday, Hammond discussed her materials science research with hundreds of elementary school students for the second part of the two-day annual conference.
In the past 20 years, the conference, which focuses on advancing women and minorities in science, has honored notables such as Mario Molina, 1995 Nobel prizewinner in chemistry, and mathematics teacher Jaime Escalante, the inspiration for the film “Stand and Deliver.”
Hammond, a chemical engineer, said the conference was particularly significant to her because of the time she spent at Harvard as a postdoctoral researcher and as a Radcliffe Institute Fellow.
Hammond spoke to the elementary school students about the many potential applications of her research on directed assembly of polymers, including fabricating remotely-controlled drug chips to treat diseases.
Along with Hammond, student volunteers gave scientific demonstrations and helped organize the event.
“A lot of volunteers really got into it, and I think some of them formed friendships with a lot of the kids,” said Justin K. Banerdt ’11, an intern at the Foundation.
Away from the hubbub of the conference, Hammond commented on how being both a minority and a woman scientist has affected her work.
“This is one of those things that you carry with you, and you really just make it a point not to [let it] be a barrier,” she said.
She spoke about the importance of mentors and positive guidance, citing how her parents instilled in her a can-do attitude.
She added that despite her best efforts to ignore how others perceived her as a minority scientist, at times she had to face the reality that as a minority or a woman scientist she might be held to different standards.
“You have to really achieve at an extremely high level to receive the level of notice that some of your colleagues might achieve,” she said.
Hammond also said her progression through science was guided largely by the mentors she found, from her high school chemistry teacher to some of her college professors.
Hammond said she is glad to both have an impact on the children she met, as well as to be a role model for them.
Professor of Neurology S. Allen Counter, director of the conference, said the event has a lasting impact on the children.
According to Counter, some of the participants in the program have later enrolled in Harvard College.
Hammond agreed that such programs are helpful for a young child’s scientific exploration.
“You need someone to light that spark,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard earned a narrow split during its first day of Ivy League play at Princeton on Saturday, losing a heartbreaker in extra innings in the first game of the doubleheader before bouncing back to take the nightcap. The Crimson benefited from solid pitching performances in both games, and could easily have emerged with two victories, but the Tigers (6-14, 1-1 Ivy) managed to squeak out a win on a walk-off single in the 12th.
“I was real happy with the pitching overall,” Harvard coach Joe Walsh said. “I thought everyone came in and did a nice job.”
The split to open Ivy League play was a clear improvement over last year’s opening weekend, when the Crimson was swept by Columbia.
“We did a great job coming out with intensity, coming out with the mindset that we were going to win games,” said sophomore pitcher and outfielder Brent Suter.
“We could have easily won both games, we could have easily dropped both games—it’s just how baseball is,” Walsh added.
HARVARD 4, PRINCETON 2
Only an hour removed from its extra-inning loss, the Crimson stepped back onto the field for the second game of the day.
“I was proud of the way the guys bounced back after losing a tough game,” Walsh said. “It was an emotional game.”
“We really let that one go and came out with a good mindset the next game,” Suter said. “We came out and just responded.”
Junior Eric Eadington pitched a gem, giving up two runs and striking out five in eight innings to earn his second win of the season.
“Eric did a great job today. He didn’t make too many bad pitches,” Walsh said. “He did a nice job of holding runners—not that there were too many runners.”
Junior Sean O’Hara hit a two-run home run in the 4th inning to give Harvard a lead it would never surrender.
After Princeton narrowed the gap with a run in the bottom of the 4th, freshman Kyle Larrow’s RBI double in the 6th extended the lead to 3-1.
Tigers senior Jon Broscious hit one off of Eadington into the bleachers in left field in the home half of the sixth, but the Crimson responded with another run on Larrow’s suicide squeeze for his second RBI of the contest.
“We squared a lot of balls up today,” Walsh said. “Even though we scored four runs, I was real happy with our at-bats.”
Senior Dan Zailskas came in and pitched a perfect ninth inning to pick up the save and secure Harvard’s first Ivy win of the season.
Walsh was also pleased with his team’s effort against one of the league’s best pitchers, Princeton junior David Palms, who has given the Crimson trouble in the past with his low-to-mid-90’s fastball and slider.
“[Palms] is a pretty good pitcher, that’s for sure,” Walsh said. “He shut us down last year.”
PRINCETON 4, HARVARD 3 (12 INN.)
Tigers senior Noel Gonzales-Luna hit a walk-off single in the bottom of the 12th inning, bringing home freshmen Alex Flink and John Mishu to capture the first game of the doubleheader for Princeton.
“It was kind of a bummer,” Suter said. “You’ve worked so hard, played so many innings, but they got the big hit.”
The Crimson took a 3-2 lead in the top of the 12th inning when junior captain Tyler Albright reached on a fielder’s choice, scoring sophomore Jeff Reynolds.
“After we scored a run, we felt pretty good about things,” Walsh said.
But the optimism didn’t last long. In the home half of the frame, Mishu singled and reached second on a sacrifice bunt, prompting Walsh to bring in freshman Joey Novak to close it out.
“It was a tough situation to bring a freshman in,” Walsh said.
Novak walked Flink and freshman Matt Bowman to load the bases before junior Dan Berardo surrendered the winning hit, a bouncing grounder between shortstop O’Hara and third baseman Reynolds.
“It took the air out of the balloon a little bit,” Walsh said.
The Tigers had taken a 2-0 lead in the fourth inning after consecutive run-scoring extra base hits by Mishu and junior Brandon Englert. Harvard responded immediately, evening the score at 2-2 in the top half of the fifth.
With men on second and third, Larrow grounded out to third, scoring a run. Junior Dillon O’Neill followed with a double to right-center, plating another.
Starter Connor Hulse went 4.2 innings for the Crimson, allowing two runs on four hits and striking out three. Sophomore Will Keuper pitched five no-hit innings in relief and struck out six.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Easter Sunday brought a plethora of offensive production to Ithaca, N.Y., as Harvard and Cornell (6-9, 2-2 Ivy) split a pair of games. In the first, the Crimson was the kid at the egg hunt with all the candy, but the Big Red bounced back in the nightcap, as Harvard (8-14, 2-2) found itself with a nearly-empty basket.
CORNELL 11, HARVARD 2
When pitcher Max Perlman envisioned his first game back, it likely included a scoreless first inning, which the junior was able to engineer.
But Perlman probably didn’t imagine that the scoreless first would be his only inning on the mound in a nine-run loss—although Crimson coach Joe Walsh noted that the one-inning limit was pre-planned.
Perlman’s replacement, junior Dan Berardo, didn’t have quite the same success as the injury-prone star.
“Cornell kind of got hot,” junior captain Tyler Albright said.
Had the Crimson been able to match its offensive productive from the first game, it would have been able to pull off a one-run win.
Unfortunately for Harvard, its bats cooled down just as the Big Red’s started to heat up.
Berardo appeared to be cruising, as the junior opened the bottom of the second with two quick outs, but Cornell racked up two singles and a walk before second baseman Matt Langseth plated the game’s first run with a single. Berardo then walked in a second run to stake the Crimson to a 2-0 deficit. With Big Red starter Tony Bertucci pitching lights-out, Harvard would never have a chance to climb back.
“They got ahead with the curveball,” sophomore pitcher Brent Suter said. “Their starter was pretty effective.”
After Berardo had struggled against Cornell’s starters, Walsh replaced him with sophomore Marcus Way and then rookie Andrew Ferreira. The freshman rallied for a solid finish, yielding two earned runs in 3.2 innings of relief.
“Ferreira finished the game,” Walsh said. “He played really well. We felt pretty good about his performance.”
But a few strong innings couldn’t make up for Harvard’s second-game struggles, as the Big Red crossed the plate twice in the fourth and four times in the fifth to put the game out of reach.
HARVARD 12, CORNELL 6
While it was a weekend to forget for some Crimson pitchers, it was a weekend to remember for freshman second baseman Kyle Larrow, who had 5 RBI in the morning contest—including a two-run homer and a triple.
It wasn’t a bad weekend for Suter, either. The sophomore pitcher was able to get the win against against a foreboding Big Red lineup.
“That was the best-hitting lineup that Cornell has had since I’ve been here,” Walsh said. “1, 2, 3, 4, 5, they were impressive.”
The home team got the upper hand on Suter early, taking a 2-0 lead in the first inning.
“I had a bad error,” said Suter in reference to a wild throw on a bunt attempt.
But the sophomore pitcher hit his stride in the second.
“Suter really found his fastball,” Walsh said.
With Suter in control on the mound, Harvard’s batters took care of the rest. Larrow got things going for the Crimson with a two-run bomb in the second that sparked a five-run inning.
“He’s kind of a little guy,” Albright said. “He takes really quality at-bats. He’s a tough out.”
Larrow was far from the only Harvard player to be successful at the plate. Every hitter reached safely at least once, and the Crimson followed up its solid second frame with three runs in the third to take a commanding lead.
“We’ve always had [balance],” Albright said. “At the bottom of our lineup, we have attackers. There’s not a weak link in our lineup.”
And while the Big Red was able to string together hits late in the game—mounting a last-inning comeback with four runs in the seventh—it proved too little, too late against a solid Harvard showing.
“[Beating Cornell] means a lot,” Suter said. “They made it far last year...They could hit. They’re a good team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Presumably, the Harvard men’s golf team doesn’t have Tiger Woods’s infidelity problems, but, unfortunately, neither did it have his sweet stroke this weekend.
The Crimson finished in third place at the Yale Spring Opener at Yale’s world-famous golf course on Saturday, ending the day a slim 10 strokes behind the Bulldogs and nine strokes behind Central Connecticut.
“This is the first tournament of the [spring] for us,” sophomore Tony Grillo said. “So it’s one to get the wheels moving. After the winter, it definitely takes a tournament or two to get back into it and prepare for the Ivy League Championship.”
Harvard was paired with the Bulldogs for the day, and the Crimson posted a total score of 592 in the 36-hole tournament.
On the first half of the course, Yale jumped out to an early lead from which the Crimson was unable to recover. The Bulldogs led by nine strokes at the midway point of the competition, but Harvard kept the match close.
A high point of the day was sophomore Mark Pollak’s strong performance and seventh-place overall finish.
Senior Greg Shuman, Grillo, and sophomore Connor Wentzell finished in the top 20 as well, with Shuman taking 16th and the sophomores tying for 19th.
Captain Danny Mayer rounded off the scoring for Harvard, finishing the day ranked 30th.
“We really just need to get ourselves [into] the game mindset,” Pollak said. “We’re all playing fine, we just don’t have the right attitude yet. We just need to get focused.”
Yale’s course, the top-ranked college golf course in the nation and the 71st-most difficult golf course nationally, proved to be very challenging for the Crimson. Though no golfer finished under par, Central Connecticut junior Justin Hughes won the tournament with an individual score of 141—a high score on most courses.
“It’s a very difficult course,” Grillo said. “[Yale] had it set up much harder than they normally do for this event, possibly because the weather was so nice. Nobody really took it very well...I don’t think any of us were really thrilled with how we played.”
Yale, enjoying a home-course advantage, was able to pull through and get the win, posting a final score of 582. Despite difficulties for Harvard, the beautiful 70-degree, sunny day provided great conditions for all of the golfers.
“We really lucked out with the weather,” Grillo said. “We normally actually have horrendous weather for this event, whether it’s raining or just really cold.”
Of the 11 teams present at the Yale Invitational on Saturday, three were Ivy League competitors—Harvard, Yale, and Dartmouth. The Big Green finished the tournament two places behind the Crimson, earning fifth on the day with a score of 600.
In some ways, Saturday’s matchup serves as a preview for the upcoming Ivy League Championship that ends the golfing season in three weeks.
“As disappointing as it is [to] play poorly, it’s definitely a good thing to know that we’re right there,” Grillo said. “Luckily we get to play not only against Yale, but against most of the Ivy League teams for our final two tournaments.”
“[These upcoming tournaments] will really give us a good sense of who’s playing best and allow us to get a good look at the competition,” he added.
Prior to Saturday’s third-place finish, the Crimson had won the Yale Invitational for the past two years. Although the spring season did not start off as smoothly for Harvard this year, the team remains optimistic.
“It was our first event of the spring,” Pollak said. “We struggled to really feel like we were at a tournament today.”
The Crimson is looking forward to continuing its spring season with its last three tournaments. Luckily, there is still plenty of time for Harvard to improve its game in practice and ready itself for a chance at an Ivy League title.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although the season is already nearly halfway over, the games that count have just begun. With Friday’s opening of the Ivy League season, the Harvard softball team knew how important it was to get a strong start in conference play.
The Crimson was able to accomplish just that, riding strong pitching to its first sweep of Princeton (6-21, 0-4 Ivy) since 2007.
Sophomore Rachel Brown hurled a no-hitter in the opening game, staking Harvard to a 4-0 win at the Class of 1895 field. A late-game rally in the nightcap gave the Crimson a 3-1 victory to complete the road sweep.
HARVARD 3, PRINCETON 1
The Tigers got out to an early 1-0 lead when Jamie Lettire knocked an RBI double to center in the bottom of the first. The Crimson would threaten in each inning but couldn’t plate any runs—despite leaving seven players on base in the first five innings.
Harvard would get all the offense it needed in the sixth, beginning with a one-out single from sophomore Jane Alexander. After Alexander stole second, senior Jess Pledger’s double brought the shortstop home to even the ledger at 1-1.
Freshman pitcher Jess Ferri followed with her third double of the season to give her team a 2-1 edge, and freshman Ashley Heritage came in to pinch-run for Ferri, scoring after Princeton’s Ellen Scott dropped a fly ball in left field.
Co-captain Margaux Black had a strong start for the Crimson, limiting the Tigers to only one run and six hits in four innings of work.
Black pitched into a bit of a jam when she allowed three-consecutive singles after retiring the first two batters in the top of the fourth, but a Scott groundout ended the threat.
“It was a very strong weekend for us,” Black said. “We had a game plan [for Princeton]—we knew going in how we would pitch against them, and we just had a little more confidence than they did. We came out strong knowing that we would dominate them.”
Sophomore Julia Moore was credited with her second victory of the season after pitching a hitless fifth inning, while Brown pitched a scoreless sixth and seventh to earn her first save of the year.
HARVARD 4, PRINCETON 0
Brown pitched the first no-hitter of her collegiate career to take the first game from the Tigers in dominating fashion. The sophomore hurler walked nobody and struck out seven for her sixth win and seventh complete game of the season.
The performance lowered Brown’s ERA to a team-best 2.14.
“This was huge,” she said. “[Princeton is] a really tough opponent, and we knew it was going to be a really tough weekend, not only because the teams are tough, but also because it’s a long weekend away from home.”
The only baserunners Brown allowed both reached in the sixth inning. After Princeton’s Kelsey VandeBergh reached on an error by junior Ellen Macadam, Candace Button reached on a fielder’s choice. The mild threat to Brown’s no-hitter ended when Brown forced Scott to ground out and Nicole Ontiveros struck out swinging.
Despite getting runners on base in every inning but the first, the Crimson was slow to secure the victory behind Brown’s strong performance. Senior Stephanie Krysiak brought junior Emily Henderson home on an RBI single in the third and would eventually come around to score on a passed ball.
It was almost the same story for Harvard in the top of the seventh, when Krysiak used an RBI double to plate Henderson for a 3-0 advantage. Krysiak scored the fourth run for the Crimson when senior Jennifer Francis reached on a fielding error by the shortstop. Sophomore Whitney Shaw was hit by a pitch to load the bases with only one out, but Macadam was tagged out at home after Alexander hit into a fielder’s choice. Pledger lined out to shortstop to end the inning.
Three Tiger errors accounted for all four Crimson runs, as Princeton’s Alex Peyton pitched a complete game, surrendering nine hits and the four unearned runs.
“It felt great,” Brown said. “The team did a great job behind me, making every play. The middle infielders had great range, the outfielders made all the catches, and we had to score, so we got contagious hitting and scored the runs. It was a huge team win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every team works for the thrill of victory. But with victory comes defeat, and this weekend, the Harvard men’s tennis team was left empty-handed.
In its opening weekend of league play, the Crimson (9-10, 0-2 Ivy) traveled to the Empire State to take on two Ivy League opponents, falling to Columbia (13-3, 3-0 Ivy), 5-2, on Friday afternoon, and to Cornell (15-6, 2-1 Ivy), 5-2, the following day.
“It’s disappointing because I think the world of this team, and it’s very hard for them to have it not go their way,” said Harvard coach Dave Fish ’72. “Everybody wants to win, and Columbia and Cornell are no different. They are thrilled...[and] you never like to make someone else’s day.”
Despite its best efforts, the Crimson found it difficult to muster momentum after losing the doubles point in both matches.
“We’ve been able to win most of our doubles points this year against even really strong teams, so it hurts to have that little bit of uncertainty,” Fish said.
CORNELL 5, HARVARD 2
The Crimson finished the weekend with a 5-2 loss to the Big Red on Saturday.
When wind speeds prior to the match wavered around the cusp of the legal limit, the coaches were faced with the choice of playing inside or outside. By remaining outside, they chose to make the wind a significant part of the game.
“The wind was a pretty big factor,” freshman Joshua Tchan said. “It was a drastic change from playing in near perfect conditions indoors [the previous day] to going outdoors.”
“It was a hard choice to make,” Fish said. “The wind just got worse and worse, and they responded better.”
To start things off, Harvard sophomore Alistair Felton and freshman Andy Nguyen defeated Cornell juniors Jonathan Jaklitsch and Mirza Klis in No. 2 doubles with an 8-3 score.
Yet two narrow 8-6 defeats earned the Big Red the doubles point and the match’s momentum, with junior Aba Omodele-Lucien and freshman Christo Schultz falling on the first court and junior Alexei Chijoff-Evans and Tchan losing on the third.
The Crimson’s two points came when No. 1 Chijoff-Evans won in straight sets, 6-4, 6-4, and when Tchan pulled through at third singles in a tight second set to win 6-4, 7-6.
But Harvard’s singles lineup was hindered by the absences of Nguyen and senior Michael Hayes due to injury recovery and illness, respectively, and Cornell followed with four more victories to clinch. Omodele-Lucien lost 6-1, 7-6, at No. 2, and No. 5 Schultz fell 6-3, 6-4. The Crimson’s two remaining players, Felton and sophomore Davis Mangham, lost their matches in the third set.
“It was very discouraging,” Fish said. “It wasn’t for lack of trying. We went indoors [Friday], and then outdoors [Saturday] in very adverse conditions. I think they were just big hills that they weren’t quite ready to climb.”
COLUMBIA 5, HARVARD 2
Both teams went into the league opener with high expectations, but the Lions succeeded in avenging their February loss to Harvard.
“A team with really strong players like that just uses that [loss] as a target,” Fish said. “They were completely ready yesterday for a great match.”
With the sting of defeat as an extra incentive, Columbia came out strong to get the early lead in the doubles contest by winning the No. 2 match, but the Crimson’s Chijoff-Evans and Tchan responded by evening the tally with an 8-4 win at No. 3.
The Lions secured the doubles point when seniors Jonathan Wong and Mihai Nichifor defeated Omodele-Lucien and Schultz, 8-6, on the first court.
“The doubles point was very close,” Fish said. “Their No. 1 team got a little bit of edge.”
Columbia took the momentum it gained from doubles and never looked back.
“Once they felt they had an edge, they...poured it on,” Fish said. “Our guys were trying as hard as they could, but there wasn’t much they could do to stop it.”
An injury to Nguyen added to the challenge, as several players had to move up in the lineup.
Schultz earned Harvard’s first victory by defeating sophomore Rajeev Deb-Sen in straight sets at No. 5 singles. Tchan added to the scoreboard for the Crimson when he overcame freshman Cyril Bucher in a third-set supertiebreaker, 7-5, 0-6, 10-3, at No. 4.
But Chijoff-Evans fell to Wong at No. 1, 6-4, 2-6, 12-10, and his teammates Omodele-Lucien, Felton, and Hayes each lost in straight sets to give Columbia the victory.
“Columbia is a terrific team, so I give them credit,” Fish said. “It was just a disappointing loss.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Opening its Ivy League season, the Harvard women’s tennis team handily defeated Columbia (9-10, 0-3 Ivy), 7-0, on Friday and Cornell (11-7, 1-2), 5-2, on Saturday at the Beren Tennis Center.
With the two wins, the Crimson (10-6, 2-0) now has a four-game winning streak, dating back to March 18. No. 52 Harvard also improved to 6-1 at home.
The Crimson cruised through the weekend, dropping only one singles match in the two days of competition. The team was forced to a third set in singles just three times.
“We stuck to our guns and got the job done,” Harvard coach Traci Green said.
HARVARD 5, CORNELL 2
The Crimson controlled singles all afternoon, as the five top-seeded players earned the win in their matches.
Of these wins, only junior Agnes Sibilski at No. 5 was forced to a third set, but Harvard had already clinched the victory by the time her match ended, 4-6, 7-5, 10-6, in Sibilski’s favor.
For Sibilski, who has been battling an injury, the match was her first since January.
“It’s tough for her—she hasn’t been playing a lot of matches,” sophomore Holly Cao said. “She lost the first set, but she found a way to win.”
Junior captain Samantha Rosekrans put together her second dominant performance of the weekend, dropping only one game in a 6-1, 6-0 win over Natalia Sanchez at No. 4.
“Sam, once again, played lights-out tennis,” Green said. “She showed what she has to offer to the team and really stepped up for us.”
No. 56 Cao defeated Christine Ordway, 6-2, 6-1, at No. 1. Cao took four consecutive games to win the first set and had little trouble in the second to complete the sweep.
When the two previously met on February 12 in the ECAC Tournament at Harvard, Cao won, 6-3, 6-0.
Harvard started the day with a loss, dropping all three doubles contests to fall behind, 1-0, early. The team of Cao and Rosekrans lost, 8-4, freshmen Hideko Tachibana and Kristin Norton fell by the score of 8-6, and sophomores Samantha Gridley and Caroline Davis could not keep it close in their 8-2 defeat.
“Cornell played really well in the doubles,” Green said. “We had a little bit of a slow start and just couldn’t really get out of the hole.”
The four Crimson players who also participated in singles all rebounded, as each swept her match.
At No. 3, Norton won, 6-3, 6-3, for her 11th win of the season. Tachibana picked up her 10th win of the season at No. 2 with a score of 6-3, 6-4.
HARVARD 7, COLUMBIA 0
Harvard had little trouble defeating the Lions for its first Ancient Eight win of the season.
After taking two of the three matches in doubles—the only loss coming in a tiebreaker—the Crimson dropped only two sets combined in the six singles matches.
Still, there were some competitive sets. Cao, Tachibana, and Norton were all forced into tiebreakers, but each managed to win.
After losing her first set on the top court, Cao won the first four games of the second. After dropping four of the next six games, she was forced to a tiebreaker, which she won, 7-5. She held on to win the third set and the match.
“Holly Cao totally found a way to win,” Green said. “She’s been doing that all season for us.”
At No. 3, Norton won her first set in a tiebreaker after falling behind, 5-4 and 6-5. She also expressed her frustration with the calls of her opponent, Chelsea Davis.
“It really gets into my head, because I’m really emotional on the court, and I feel like they’re stealing the point away,” Norton said. “I try not to think about it too much—I get angry, and then I forget about it.”
She won the second set more easily, 6-2, to sweep the match.
At No. 4, Rosekrans put together a strong performance against Columbia, winning, 6-3, 6-1. The captain’s contest was the fastest of the afternoon.
“Sam Rosekrans really led the way for us,” Green said. “She finished first, really quickly. She was really focused, and got the job done.”
Tachibana, freshman Alex Lehman, and Gridley won their matches at No. 2, No 5., and No. 6, respectively.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hoping to earn a spot in the four-team Ivy League tournament at season’s end, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team took a step in the wrong direction Saturday morning, falling into the fifth spot in the conference standings.
Squaring off against conference-rival Yale (4-6, 1-2 Ivy) at Reese Stadium, the Crimson (4-4, 1-2 Ivy) was unable to recover from a nine-goal halftime deficit despite a late comeback, dropping the contest, 17-13.
“It’s kind of becoming a trend with the rough starts we have had the past couple of games,” sophomore Melanie Baskind said. “We got the first couple draws and then had trouble responding when they started scoring.”
Freshmen Jennifer VanderMeulen and Danielle Tetreault helped narrow the gap to three with less than three minutes to go, netting a combined seven second-half tallies. But the Bulldogs kept the Crimson off the scoreboard over the final 2:51, preserving the win.
After failing to force a turnover in the first half of play, the Harvard defense came alive in the final period, forcing the Bulldogs to cough up the ball five times. The Crimson offense capitalized on the extra possessions, netting 11 of its 13 tallies over just 20 minutes of play.
“We started playing with more heart and intensity,” Tetreault said. “We became more aggressive.”
Tetreault sparked the comeback, using a free position shot seven minutes into the second half to end a 9-0 Yale run.
Just over a minute later, Tetreault found co-captain Sara Flood open for a goal, putting the score at 13-4. VanderMeulen followed with her second of five tallies in the contest, going unassisted to the cage.
“[VanderMeulen’s] one of our most consistent players,” Tetreault said. “The Ivy teams are looking out for her, but she’s still able to capitalize on the opportunities she gets.”
Tetreault brought the deficit to seven with an unassisted score 1:03 later.
But Harvard’s offense went cold, failing to light up the scoreboard over nearly 10 minutes of play. To make matters worse for the visitors, Yale freshman Devon Rhodes notched three of her game-high eight goals over the next five minutes, putting her team up, 16-9, with 4:39 left.
The Crimson rattled off four straight scores to get within three, but its initial deficit was too much to overcome, as the score stood at 17-13 when the final buzzer sounded.
“The first half was a little weak,” Tetreault said. “I think we built off of it in the second, but we had already dug ourselves too deep of a hole to get out of.”
The Bulldogs got off to a hot start, striking first off a free position shot from Jenna Block 2:39 into the contest. Harvard’s Baskind answered minutes later to even it at one.
But Yale went on a 3-0 run behind a free position shot from Kaitlyn Flatley and two assists from Block to take control, 4-1.
VanderMeulen kept the game from getting out of hand, adding a free position shot. But it was all Bulldogs for the rest of the half.
Caroline Crow’s goal with 16:45 remaining ignited a 7-0 Yale run to close out the half. Yale got out of the gates quickly to start the second, as Rhodes notched two scores to put her team up by 11.
“I think we had a hard time covering their cutters,” Baskind said. “They’re a much more passing-oriented team than we expected. In the past we’ve faced teams that are much more direct in their attack.”
With the loss, the Crimson moves into the fifth spot in the conference standings. If Harvard hopes to earn one of the four berths in the Ivy League tournament, the Crimson will likely need to come away with wins in tough contests against No. 9 Dartmouth and No. 17 Princeton.
“We’re not in the position that we’d like to be in,” Baskind said. “I think we’re going to need a little a bit of help from this point on.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The scene outside Harvard Stadium before Friday night’s Harvard-Duke lacrosse game was something that Crimson lacrosse had never seen before.
Free food, tailgating, and thousands of UC-purchased shirts littered the outskirts of the field, all part of an effort to act on the hype that had surrounded this matchup since Harvard upset the Blue Devils in its 2009 season opener, 9-6.
But while the Crimson (5-3, 1-1 Ivy) was enjoying the sensation surrounding the pregame festivities, Duke was all business, all night, leading it to a 14-5 win.
The Blue Devils (8-3, 0-2 ACC) scored five goals in less than five minutes to open the contest, making sure the game was over before the lingering tailgaters even found a place to sit. Duke added three more goals before the first quarter ended, leaving a Harvard crowd of more than 13,000 in shock that the Blue Devils had more goals—eight—than the Crimson had shots—five—in the first quarter alone.
The first quarter was all she wrote for Harvard, as Duke would dominate ball control throughout the night.
“[Duke’s] execution was great, and they came out ready to play,” Crimson coach John Tillman said. “I didn’t want us to play the scoreboard, and I think our guys really came together and rallied around the fact that it wasn’t going well, which is a good sign for the future.”
Despite the Blue Devils’ dominating first quarter, Harvard refused to cave in and simply hand over an easy victory. After freshman Peter Schwartz rifled one past Duke’s Dan Wigrizer for the first goal of his career, junior Dean Gibbons spun right around defenseman Jason Orlando and bounced a shot into the bottom left corner of the goal to bring the deficit to 9-2.
Flashes of the Crimson’s incredible comeback from six down against Dartmouth last weekend were smothered when the Blue Devils scored the next three goals to take a 12-2 lead. Sophomore Jeff Cohen found co-captain Travis Burr from behind the net for an easy goal to give Harvard a little bit of momentum, but the squad headed into halftime down, 12-3.
Duke was in complete command of the second half, content to work the ball slowly and rely on its defense to prevent the Crimson from developing any momentum.
For the Blue Devils, it was one of their most complete games of the season. Three players had multiple goals by the end of the first quarter, and as a team, Duke outshot Harvard, 49-32. Throughout the game, the Blue Devils handily dominated possession, due in large part to winning 14 of the 21 faceoffs. The Crimson lacked many opportunities to create turnovers, as Duke was an astounding 15-for-15 on clear attempts.
“It wasn’t really anything we could put our finger on,” junior midfielder Andrew Parchman said. “On this day, Duke was just better than us. It was a disappointment that we lost, but it’s nothing to bow our heads about. We just have to come out next time and play 60 minutes.”
Although the eight goals allowed in the first quarter makes it hard to believe, Harvard’s most valuable player in the game was arguably freshman goalie Harry Krieger.
A week after allowing 11 goals and saving only three shots against Dartmouth, Krieger settled after the first and recorded a career-high 17 saves in the contest.
“Harry could’ve easily folded his tent, but that’s not Harry...he’s a competitor,” Tillman said. “If things aren’t going well, he’s going to fight to turn things around. Once he started making some saves, I really think he inspired the guys around him to play.”
While the loss certainly comes as a disappointment to the Crimson, it doesn’t affect the conference standings that will ultimately determine Harvard’s tournament chances. After Ivy League favorite Cornell was upset by Dartmouth over the weekend, the team is aware that anything can happen the rest of the way.
“The most important thing for us right now is to keep coaching our guys, keep trying to make them better, and making sure they know we improve as a team,” Tillman said. “I know they’ll stay together, and I’m sure we’ll come out ready to play much better next week.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past weekend, the Radcliffe Lightweight and Heavyweight crew teams took to the water to challenge two of the nation’s top rowing teams—Georgetown and Brown.
The lightweight team raised its first trophy of the season, decisively blanking the Hoyas, but the heavyweight squad emerged from its dual season’s first regatta on a less auspicious note, losing to Brown.
NO. 4 RADCLIFFE LIGHTWEIGHTS VS. NO. 5 GEORGETOWN
Last season was a virtual tug-of-war on water for the then-No. 4 Radcliffe and then-No. 5 Georgetown women’s lightweight crews. After the Black and White prevailed at the Class of 2004 Cup, the Hoyas responded by robbing Radcliffe of a bronze medal at the EAWRC Sprints. But the Black and White had the final say of the season, closing out the IRA National Championships one position ahead of Georgetown.
Understandably, Radcliffe was careful not to overlook its opponent going into this past Saturday’s race against the Hoyas, in which the crews boasted the same rankings as a year ago. A victory on the water in this year’s Class of 2004 Cup would be key to setting the tone of competition between the two rivals for the remainder of the season.
The Black and White accomplished just that with a sweep of the Hoyas on the Charles, as both the first and second varsity eight improved to 2-0 on the season. The victory gave Radcliffe its first win against a ranked opponent this season.
At the outset of Saturday’s varsity eight race, the Hoyas matched the Black and White stroke-for-stroke, building an early lead. But Radcliffe eventually established its rhythm on the water, enabling it to come back to seize victory with a 7:24.5 finish. Georgetown clocked in five seconds behind at 7:29.9.
“We worked really hard all winter, and it was nice to come into the spring season and see that work pay off,” said junior 1V rower Lizzy Bates.
The 2V squad pulled off a more decisive victory, cruising steadily along the open water to cross the finish line at 7:46.7—nearly 11 seconds ahead of the Hoyas.
Strong performances from both boats at headwind gave Radcliffe its second consecutive Class of 2004 Cup win and its fourth overall in the Cup’s history. The Cup was established by a donation from the seniors in the class of 2004 at both Harvard and Georgetown.
“We really respect Georgetown, and we regard ourselves as being really close to them,” Radcliffe coach Heather Cartwright said. “Both programs knew how much work each had to do to win. The race was a good barometer to see that we have put in some solid work throughout the winter.”
NO. 19 RADCLIFFE HEAVYWEIGHTS VS. NO. 5 BROWN
The sunny Saturday morning skies did not bode as well for No. 19 Radcliffe heavyweight crew, as the Black and White surrendered four of five races to No. 5 Brown (3-1) on the Seekonk River.
Despite an initially close contest between the varsity eight teams, the Bears outlasted the Black and White for the rest of the race, crossing the finish line at 6:50.2, well ahead of Radcliffe’s 7:05.5.
The Black and White also dropped races in the second and third varsity eight, with times of 7:19.6 and 7:52.3, respectively.  In the Varsity Four B/C race, the Radcliffe B team finished behind both Brown’s B and C teams, coming in at 8:42.4.
The regatta indicated that the Black and White has what it takes to compete among the nation’s best heavyweight teams.
The Radcliffe Varsity Four A team—comprised of junior coxswain Rachel Rauh, senior Jennie Peterson, freshman Jess Mealia, sophomore Kirsten Van Fossen, and freshman Scout Moran—posted the sole victory, edging out Brown by exactly one second at 7:56.1.
“[Four A] got called back to the starting line,” Radcliffe co-captain Christine Baugh said.  “Their second start off breakage was actually not as good as the first, so they really had to bite into it. In that race, it was all about willpower. They never once gave up, and it really showed at the end.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A record number of lacrosse fans turned out Friday night for the men’s lacrosse game against the Duke Blue Devils. Unfortunately, anyone who stayed an extra five or 10 minutes at the tailgate before coming in to watch the game missed the bulk of the action.
Duke began a stunning 8-0 scoring run less than a minute into the first quarter with Blue Devil Zach Howell putting one past Crimson rookie goalkeeper Harry Krieger with 14:13 to go. Just over a minute later, Harvard’s defense turned the ball over, and Duke’s Max Quizinari picked up a ground ball. The Blue Devils’ offense settled into its set—as it would do continually through the first quarter—undisturbed by the Crimson defense. At 12:51, Duke’s Steve Schoeffel tallied his 10th goal of the season on an unassisted shot, putting the Blue Devils up 2-0 just over two minutes into the half.
Duke picked up an unstoppable rhythm early in the first quarter—win the face-off, grab the ground ball, run the set, and capitalize on shot opportunities. Harvard gave up eight of nine face-offs in the first quarter alone and won only six of 20 ground balls. The Crimson never possessed the ball long enough to push up field and run its own sets. The Blue Devils controlled the momentum from the first face-off.
“We came out flat and a little too hesitant,” senior defenseman Ben Smith said. “We weren’t getting the tough ground balls and getting the 50/50 plays, and those 50/50 plays can make a big difference, especially in the beginning. [Duke] got some series off of that, and lacrosse is a game about getting runs. They went on a big run, the biggest run we’ve seen.”
Looking to the scoreboard in the first quarter and finding itself behind is not a new phenomenon for Harvard. In the Crimson’s first Ivy League game against Brown two weekends ago, the Bears opened up a 5-1 lead in the first quarter and had a 7-4 advantage going into the half. Last weekend against Dartmouth, Harvard was down, 4-3, after the first, but the Big Green extended that lead to 7-3 by the half.
Despite continually falling behind in the first half, Harvard has fought back in the second half to either win or play evenly with each opponent. Against Brown, the Crimson won the second half, 7-6. Against Dartmouth, it held a huge margin in the last two quarters, 10-4. And against Duke, Harvard played with the Blue Devils in the last half of the game, matching Duke’s goals, 2-2.
Harvard was able to come within one goal of Brown by the end of the game, and against Dartmouth, it rallied to a victory. The 8-0 deficit to the Blue Devils proved too much to recover from on Friday.
“Dartmouth went on a run and we got down, 9-3, but we were able to overcome the adversity and come back,” Smith said. “But in this one, I guess we didn’t make the big changes soon enough in our mentality. We just weren’t as organized as we should have been on defense.”
The Crimson repeatedly rallies by returning to the fundamentals of the game—focusing on winning faceoffs and 50/50 ground ball opportunities.
Harvard posts a young roster this year that continues to improve with experience. The rookie goalie, Krieger, played one of his best games against Duke. He recorded a career-high 17 saves and was successful on 17 of 21 clear attempts.
Now, with the potential loss of co-captain Billy Geist—who went down with an injury early in the first half against Duke—younger guys are going to have to step up.
“We have been able to rotate some guys down to where we need them,” senior midfielder Jason Duboe said. “And all those guys are definitely capable, because this system right now is more important than the individual. [Assistant coach Kevin] Warne has put in a system [where] you can basically plug people into the equation, and the results are still the same.”
In the coming weeks, Harvard must work on putting on the pressure earlier in the game, working within the system it has set up, and executing the plan on defense and offense.
“We have to work,” junior midfielder Andrew Parchman said. “We know we’re a great team—we just have to act like it. Unfortunately, it’s taken us a little longer than just the first quarter to buckle down and show what we’ve really got. But that can change.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Perhaps there was something in the water this weekend.
Both the Charles River and Ithaca’s Cayuga Lake bore witness to dominant showings by the Harvard men’s lightweight and heavyweight crews. In their first races of the season, both squads saw their Crimson blades carry the teams’ boats to first-place finishes in every race.
On Saturday, the No. 4 heavyweight team made the long trek to Ithaca to face No. 11 Cornell for the teams’ first head-to-head race since 1961.
“We went in anticipating that they’d be fast and highly motivated,” assistant coach Wayne Berger said. “We weren’t disappointed in that regard, but we were ready to race hard and challenge them.”
Berger, an alum of the very Ivy League school his team was facing, combined forces with head coach Harry Parker to conquer the Big Red in all five races. In the first race of the day, the third varsity eight appeared to come up short as Cornell’s boat crossed the finish line two seconds ahead. But the win was awarded to Harvard.
“Cornell crossed first, but they were disqualified for a lane violation,” Berger said. “They came into Harvard’s lane and impeded our boat.”
In the next race, a young varsity eight crew came from behind to capture a solid victory over its Big Red competition with a time of 5:36.9. The top boat took to the water with five new sophomore rowers joining captain Blake Pucsek and juniors Anthony Locke and David Wakulich.
“They really like to race, and they’re not inhibited by that or intimidated,” Berger said. “Even though the boats have only been selected for about a week, [the sophomores] raced with poise...They had great control of the race.”
In the next three races, the second varsity, freshman eight, and second freshman eight crews beat Cornell’s boats to the finish line. With that, the Crimson sealed its victory, and Berger ended the day having defeated his former school and classmate, Big Red head coach Todd Kennett.
“It was a fantastic day,” Berger summarized. “Everyone raced really well—it was a great way to open the season.”
NO. 2 LIGHTWEIGHTS VS. DELAWARE
Back in Cambridge, the No. 2 Harvard lightweight team opened its season against the University of Delaware.
Like Cornell’s team, the Fightin’ Blue Hens arrived at the race with a regatta under its belt. But this did little to slow the efforts of the Crimson as the home squad swept Delaware in all four races.
“We won all the races by open water—a good margin,” assistant coach Linda Muri explained. “The way the races unfolded gives me confidence as a coach going forward. None of the crews were flustered in the early parts of the race where it’s [typically] going to be close.”
From the start, Harvard’s varsity boats were poised to perform well because of the many experienced athletes on the roster. From the varsity eight returned senior coxswain Dexter Louie and five rowers, including captain Martin Eiermann. All eight rowers from the 3V team retained their seats, and the second varsity eight had eight athletes return—junior coxswain Lizzy Maybank and seven rowers.
Considering the success of these boats last season—winning the Jope Cup as Eastern Sprints Champions—the pressure was on to row to impress.
“It does put pressure on them,” Muri admitted. “[But] most guys respond well to pressure. They enjoy the competition against the other schools, and in our league it’s very tight.”
At 9:24 a.m. the varsity eight took to the water. The race was tied through the first 500 meters, but by the third 500, the Crimson had the lead to carry it to a nine-second win in 6:16.2.
In the third race of the day, the 2V and 3V boats were pitted against the Blue Hens’ second varsity eight. Harvard’s second varsity eight finished first, and, after trailing early on, the third varsity eight came from behind to capture second place.
In the freshman races, the Crimson continued to race well.
The freshman crew won its event by almost seven seconds, and in the freshman fours race Harvard’s A boat thrashed its competition, winning by a 32-second margin. Delaware captured second place in front of the Crimson’s three other fours.
Muri noted that, despite the strong performance by the team, Harvard must keep in mind that there will be kinks to smooth out as the season progresses.
“Until you get a couple of races under your belt, you’re not quite sure how things are going,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After weeks of traveling to the far corners of the country, the Crimson track team finally got a preview of its Ivy League competition a bit closer to home. Harvard traveled to Princeton, N.J. for the Sam Howell Invitational on Friday and Saturday, taking on a field that included Yale, Princeton, and many other New England schools.
“It was a good [meet] for this point in the season,” said men’s co-captain Justin Grinstead. “We were able to have some teams that we’ll see later on and some lighter competition, so it was not too intense, but enough to work on the competitive mindset.”
The Crimson showed plenty of intensity on the track, though, capturing three events as part of a solid team effort.
“A number of performances were really outstanding—it’s hard to narrow it down,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “Overall, I thought it was a great meet.”
The track team appeared particularly impressive as a large squad due to its success in the relays—demonstrating the program’s emphasis on team effort. The women’s 4x400-meter team of sophomores Magda Robak and Shannon Conway and freshmen Melissa Bellin and Jasmine Cho blazed past their opponents, crossing the line first in 3:48.29.
“The women’s 4x400 ran really well with a lot of really good legs,” Grinstead said. “The relays are always a really fun event to get together and get more of the team involved. It starts off the meet and gets everyone charged up.”
The men’s 4x100-meter team of sophomores Stephen Gelonek, John Dingus, and Jonathan Meminger and junior John Fahnenstiel also fared well, taking third with a time of 42.35 in a competitive field. But Gelonek noted that the squad has room for improvement.
“We have some good runners, but right now, we’re still trying to get in sync with each other,” he said. “It was a decent race...We’re trying to get into the low-41 [second range] instead of mid-42’s.”
Still, Saretsky noted progress for the young relay team. And while these group efforts demonstrated the depth of the Crimson’s runners, a few individuals continued to stand out.
Rookie Ashtynn Baltimore claimed one of two individual titles on the day, winning the women’s long jump in decisive fashion with a leap of 5.84 meters. The other winner was Bellin, who added to a “monster leg,” according to Saretsky, in the 4x400 with a victory in the 400-meter hurdles. The rookie’s time of 1:02.43 represented a significant drop from just two weeks ago.
“[Bellin] has been great—she took quite a bit of time off what she ran in Houston [at the Texas Southern Relays],” Saretsky said. “She’s put in the work and she’s in great shape, so it was great to see her go out and do well.”
Freshmen Olivia Weeks and Meghan Ferreira rounded out a strong weekend for the first-year women, as Weeks took third in the triple jump with an mark of 11.95 meters while Ferreira crossed the line in second in the 100-meter hurdles.
“I’m excited that our freshmen have done pretty well so far,” Gelonek said of the standout effort from rookies, but there was plenty of success to go around.
Gelonek and classmate Robbie Paris had strong showings in the 100-meter dash and 400-meter hurdles, respectively. Gelonek took second despite a nagging hamstring injury, while Paris notched a significant personal best in 55.0 seconds, good enough for sixth.
“Last year, [Paris] had a bit of an injury-plagued freshman year,” Saretsky said. “This year, he’s doing a much better job of managing the aches and pains. He took a big step in the 400 hurdles [this weekend], and there’s much more to come there.”
Cho and junior Hilary May also enjoyed good weekends, placing fourth in the women’s 400-meter and 800-meter races, respectively, while a pair of Crimson competitors—junior Dina Emde and rookie Mary Hirst—tied for fourth in the high jump after clearing the 1.65-meter mark.
With such success across a wide range of events, Harvard was able to take encouragement from its performance in Weaver Track & Field Stadium—the venue that will play host to the Heptagonal Championships in just over a month.
“It’s great to be able to get onto the facility [before Heps],” Saretsky said. “We were able to get the lay of the land and [a feel] for how we match up with other Ivy League schools...The meet boded well for what’s to come.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Not even halfway through her Harvard career, sophomore pitcher Rachel Brown has already made her way into Crimson softball history.
A year after setting the program single-season strikeout record, Brown added another accomplishment to her already-lengthy resumé on Friday—her first career no-hitter.
Brown’s stat line was flawless in Harvard’s Ivy opener, as the hurler allowed no hits and no walks while ringing up seven. The only thing between the sophomore and perfection was a sixth-inning fielding error from junior second baseman Ellen Macadam.
The Crimson summoned enough offense to come away with the 4-0 win.
Brown’s gem was the first no-hitter thrown by a Harvard pitcher since May 5, 2007, when Shelly Madick ’08 allowed just one walk in Game 1 of the Ivy League Championship series against Penn. Coincidentally, the Crimson also won that game by a 4-0 count, and Madick also recorded seven strikeouts—and Madick came on to save the second game of the doubleheader, just as Brown did against Princeton on Friday.
Madick’s heroics brought her team its fourth-ever Ivy title. While Brown’s no-hitter didn’t have the same implications, it did get Harvard’s conference season started on the right foot. Through the first weekend of play, the Crimson leads the North Division with a 3-1 record.

Do your summer plans involve an extended stay in beautiful Cambridge? Are you still working to find a roommate for that enviable summer pad? A new Web site is trying to solve this by hooking up students (for housing) at DeWolfe and other residences around Harvard.
On the Harvard College Undergraduate Research Association’s site, you can register and then either browse the ads put up by other students or post your own. HCURA developed the site two or three years ago because “a lot of people, especially those doing research, are looking for housing,” said Carol Y. J. Suh ’11, a former HCURA president.
“Since then, a lot of people have been able to find roommates and places over the summer,” she said.
The site concentrates on DeWolfe housing with separate categories for gender, but it also has a place to post ads to find roommates who want to live in other areas. It’s open to anyone, not just Harvard students or summer researchers, according to Suh.
It may take a few minutes to figure out how to use the tool. To post an ad, you have to click “Roommate search” on the left, choose the category, and then click the “Submit ad” link that shows up at the top. There are only a few listings on right now, but it can’t hurt to browse and possibly put up your own listing if you’re sticking around for the summer.
Beyond the HCURA’s Web site, Crimsonlist offers a section on housing, but it doesn’t have a way to search for specific locations or for a particular roommate gender. Right now, there’s only one post for a sublet across the River—hardly a critical mass—but as people finalize summer plans, this may change.
In the search for a roommate, watch out for deadlines: for those hoping to sign up for DeWolfe housing, applications are accepted on a rolling basis until April 19, according to the Office of Student Life Web site.

After five grueling months of winter and/or torrential rain, the sun has finally peeked its head out, bringing with it an 80 percent increase in the amount of bare skin shown by Harvard students.
Though we don't endorse excessive amounts of UV exposure (sunburns and melanoma anyone?), a little sun never hurt anyone. So here are your best bets if you are looking to catch up on your Vitamin D.
1. The Dunster and Winthrop courtyards
What's the point of a River House if you can't see the River? Dunster has one of the most beautiful courtyards, which opens up onto the glittering Charles River. Winthrop's courtyard is also picturesque, complete with a dedicated patio area and a tire swing, though the trees may create more shade than is desired by sun-starved students.
Honorable Mention: The courtyard alongside the Leverett Towers
2. The Radcliffe Quadrangle
Though the Quad may be far, it does have plenty of open space. The expansive Quadrangle is the perfect place to spread a towel and soak up some sun. The terrace above Cabot dining hall is another convenient space to relax with friends.
3. The Yard
If you don't mind the heavy foot traffic (and the smelly lawn aeration process that is currently going on), the Yard is nice place to enjoy the temperate weather and relive your carefree freshman days. Who knows, maybe they will bring the colorful lawn chairs back! Your best bet for shade-free sun exposure is probably the often neglected patches of grass near Lamont.
Wherever you decide to simulate your spring break, tan while you can! Rain looms on the weekend forecast.

I'm going to be in the Quad next year. I've heard that Porter Square has some awesome ethnic restaurants? Is this true? Which are the best?
Is hipster an ethnicity? If so, you might want to try Zing! Pizza. They have a divine "Blue October" which pairs a thin, crunchy crust with dreamy swirls of caramelized onion, blue cheese, and mozzarella with a butternut squash sauce. They also stock gluten-free crusts for the wheat-wary.
But to answer your question more directly, you'll find the most joy comes from Porter Exchange Mall, inexplicably housed in a Lesley University building, a hop and a skip from the Porter Square T stop. There, you'll find a Asian food court brimming with goodies like steaming bowls of ramen at Tampopo; warm, luscious pieces of unagi nigiri at Blue Fin; satisfying bowls of Japanese curry and rice bowls at Cafe Mami; and for dessert, don't miss out on the decadence of cream and azuki-stuffed buns at Japonaise Bakery. The deliciousness of all of these meals is compounded by the fact they're really wallet-friendly.
If you're looking for a stone bowl bi bim bap, Seoul Food (clever!) down the street does a perfectly acceptable version. I like to supercharge mine with a few buckets of gochujang—the hot pepper paste that comes with it.
So get fat, and enjoy.
