After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eminem, along with rock band The Killers and musician Jack White, will headline this year’s Boston Calling music festival at the Harvard Athletic Complex from May 25 to 27, its organizers announced Thursday.
The concert marks Eminem’s first time performing in New England since 2005.
This year’s iteration of Boston Calling will feature more than 50 performances from musicians and comedians like rapper Tyler, The Creator, rock band Portugal The Man, and comedian Jenny Slate. The event will also include two podcasts: Pod Save America and Lovett or Leave It.
Natalie Portman ’03 is also expected to “curate and host a series of special programming,” according to the event’s organizers.
This will be the second year Boston Calling is hosted at Harvard’s athletic complex. In May 2016, the event organizers announced the festival would be held at Harvard instead of Boston City Hall plaza, which housed the concert since its debut in 2013.
Festival designer Russ Bennett, who organized the layout and visuals of the 2017 Boston Calling festival, will return to design the concert this year. But this year’s event will bring several new additions. According to a press release, the 2018 iteration of the concert will feature a new sound system, stronger wi-fi, a designated VIP lounge, larger video screens, and added entrance lanes.
The sound system is meant to reduce the noise level generated by the festival, whose location places it near the homes of some Allston residents. Last year, Allstonians said they were concerned the concert’s move to Harvard facilities would bring heavy foot traffic and potential safety issues.
The festival’s organizers said they are excited about this year’s lineup.
“Each year we continue to push ourselves to bring fans the very best festival experience,” said Brian Appel, co-founder and chief executive officer of Boston Calling Events, in a press release. “With some new changes and features already announced for this year’s festival, and many more on the way, we are ready and excited to treat our fans to an incredible weekend of performances from some of the world’s most iconic music acts.”
Last year’s event featured performances from Chance the Rapper, indie pop band Tegan and Sara, and electronic music group Major Lazer, among other artists. The event drew nearly 40,000 attendees.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 8, 2018 at 4:55 p.m.
Harvard announced a slate of candidates vying for spots on the Board of Overseers—the University’s second highest governing board—and elected directorships in the Harvard Alumni Association on Friday.
All Harvard degree holders, barring those in University governance positions and Harvard Corporation members, are eligible to vote in the election via mail-in ballot. Alumni will elect five of the eight nominees put forward by an Alumni Association nominating committee to serve six-year terms. Additional candidates can also be nominated through a petition process.
Members of the Board of Overseers are tasked with weighing in on the direction of the University, advising top Harvard administrators, and approving certain actions by the University’s highest governing body, the Harvard Corporation. Three current Overseers are now serving as members of Harvard’s presidential search committee, which is working to find a successor for University President Drew G. Faust, who will step down in June.
Though the nominees are all Harvard alums, they hail from a range of backgrounds and geographical locations. This year’s eight Overseers nominees comprise president of the Sunshine Care Foundation Geraldine Acuna-Sunshine ’92, retired U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Philip Hart Cullom, finance director Catherine A. Gellert ’93, Boston Ballet Executive Director Meredith L. Hodges ’03, law partner Marilyn Holifield, retired pharmaceutical company CEO John C. Lechleiter, tech executive Diego A. Rodriguez, and National Congress of American Indians policy research director Yvette Roubideaux ’85.
Those elected will replace outgoing members Scott A. Abell ’72, James E. Johnson, Tracy P. Palandjian ’93, Swati A. Piramal, and Kathryn A. Taylor.
Candidates for Harvard Alumni Association elected directors will serve as representatives of the general alumni community on the HAA board of directors. The nominees are: oil technology company CEO Eric R. Calderon, Brown University architect Collette Creppell ’82, Microsoft executive Sid Espinosa, pastor and Habitat for Humanity lawyer Natosha Reid Rice ’93, physician Krishnan Namboodiri Subrahmanian ’03, Hong Kong investment firm co-founder Rita Pang ’96, Northwestern University administrator Matthew Temple ’86, Mass. high school principal Bella T. Wong ’82, and Vanderbilt Ph.D. student Rashid Muhammed Yasin.
University administrators will mail ballots to eligible voters by April 1, and alumni must complete and return their ballots by May 15.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: January 8, 2018
A previous version of this story incorrectly indicated that certain United States government officials with Harvard degrees are barred from voting in the Board of Overseers elections. In fact, it is those in University governance positions with Harvard degrees who are barred from voting in the Board of Overseers elections.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a disappointing performance in nonconference play, the Harvard men's basketball team shook off a test from visiting Dartmouth, 61-51, in its Ivy League opener on Saturday afternoon. The win snapped a three-game losing streak for the Crimson (6-9, 1-0 Ivy League) and was the team's third consecutive victory over the Big Green (4-8, 0-1).
Sophomore forward Seth Towns was the leading scorer for Harvard on a day when both teams struggled to hold onto the basketball—the teams combined for 36 giveaways. The Crimson jumped out to a 19-9 lead to begin the contest but its guests fought back after the intermission. Dartmouth took the lead with just over seven minutes to play in the second half but Harvard ended the game on a 19-6 run.
“We all know basketball is a game of runs,” sophomore guard Justin Bassey said. “They had their run and we knew we were bound to have ours. We just got to dig in, get stops, and really come together as a unit. We finished the second half really strong as a team.”
As has been the case this season, the Crimson relied on its shooting from deep. The hosts shot a scalding 48 percent from the long range, converting 12 three-pointers in the process. Towns, Bassey, and junior Corey Johnson each hit three triples.
Accuracy from long range was also a critical facet in Harvard’s late-game run. The Crimson scored 12 of their final 19 points from beyond the three-point line. Of the four triples down the stretch, three were essentially from the exact same location—the left corner baseline directly in front of the Crimson bench.
“I do think we have been better [this season] than how we have shot the ball,” coach Tommy Amaker said. “Certainly we were fortunate and happy that we made some big ones here this afternoon.”
Sophomore forward Chris Lewis had a relatively quiet day from the field, shooting three-for-six from the field for six points to go along with four rebounds. However, the Alpharetta, Ga., native had a standout performance on defense. Lewis swatted away four Big Green shot attempts and did not commit a single personal foul in 24 minutes of play.
“When Chris is just killing it on the inside and dominating in the paint and the glass, that enables us to get really good looks at the basket.” Bassey said.
Sophomore point guard Bryce Aiken played four minutes in the first half after missing Harvard's last four contests with a knee injury. Sophomore guard Christian Juzang, Aiken's replacement in the starting lineup, set a career high in points (12) in a team-leading 35 minutes but turned the ball over five times.
“[Bryce] needs some time to practice I think to build himself up and get his feet wet in the game, like he did today, and get ready for practice,” Amaker said. “I think that’s what he needs more than anything.”
The Crimson held a 15-point lead at the 17:50 mark of the second half, but the advantage was squandered after a scoreless stretch of over six minutes. In that span, Dartmouth scored 15 unanswered points and found itself leading by three with 5:59 to play.
Senior guard Miles Wright paced the Big Green with 23 points on a day in which his team struggled mightily from the field. While Wright shot 8-of-13 from the field, his teammates went a combined 9-of 32.
Freshman forward Chris Knight, who scored in double figures in nine of 11 games entering Saturday, played in limited minutes and logged just two points. Sophomore guard Brendan Barry, Dartmouth’s leading three-point scorer, was also largely ineffective and converted just one triple in the contest.
Overall, the Crimson had a strong day on defense. Limiting the Big Green offense largely to Wright played into Amaker’s gameplan and showed important development in practice for Harvard over the winter break.
“We worked on some fundamental things [on defense] like our stance and denial of passes,” Amaker said. “I thought it really paid big dividends for us to give us that cushion in the first half. We really worked on [defense] and it was really good to see that the work paid off.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s basketball team dropped Saturday’s Ivy League season-opener to Dartmouth by a 63-56 mark at Leede Arena in a frustrating game that forced the Crimson to chase the hosts all evening.
Although Harvard (7-6, 0-1 Ivy) narrowed the deficit to 51-46 in the fourth quarter, eight unanswered points by the Big Green (9-5, 1-0), six of which came from junior guard Cy Lippold, put to rest any hopes of a late comeback for the Crimson.
Harvard entered Saturday’s road contest riding a two-game win streak with history on the team’s side. The Crimson beat Dartmouth in both contests last season, and since 2010, was 12-3 against the Big Green.
Saturday told a different story, with Dartmouth leading for almost the entirety of the game. After taking a 9-8 first-quarter lead, the Big Green never trailed. Harvard didn’t help its own cause, either—the Crimson was plagued by poor shooting and careless ball-handling, committing 21 turnovers, tying its season-high.
Turnovers proved to be a familiar and costly issue for Harvard. Earlier in non-conference play, the Crimson committed 20 turnovers in each of losses to Florida Gulf Coast and Virginia.
“We’ve been trying to control the turnovers,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “But when we play tight, we go too fast…close to half of their points came from our turnovers.”
The Crimson fell behind in the first quarter and struggled mightily in a second quarter that saw Dartmouth extend its lead, outscoring the visitors by a 17-9 tally.
Further compounding Harvard’s problems was early foul trouble for starting sophomore forward Jeannie Boehm. The second-year was whistled for two fouls in the first three minutes of the game, forcing her to sit out most of the first half.
While Harvard dominated the glass early and often, snaring 21 offensive rebounds, the team was ice cold from the field, shooting a mere 27 percent and converting just 1-11 three-point attempts entering halftime.
“Nothing was falling for us,” Delaney-Smith said. “Then we started to take bad shots, and we started to rush. Instead of reacting with more poise and toughness, we didn’t, we were frenetic.”
The twelve-point halftime deficit proved to be insurmountable, despite a heroic effort from senior guard Taylor Rooks, who delivered a career-high 23-point, 11-rebound, double-double for the Crimson.
Rooks, the game’s leading scorer, was the only Harvard player to score more than 10 points on an evening when the Crimson shot under 20 percent from three-point territory, and converted just 50 percent of its free-throws. The Warren, N.J., native converted nine of her 19 field goals and played for all but two of the game’s minutes.
“Taylor was very consistent, she was very poised, I didn’t even get to rest her,” Delaney-Smith explained. “I thought she played a really good game, but it’s never about just one person.”
Lippold led Dartmouth with 19 points and four steals, providing steady guard play while converting on all four of her free throw opportunities. The East Stroudsburg, Penn., native shot an impressive three of four from beyond the arc and was instrumental in helping the hosts weather Harvard’s late surge.
The Crimson had more success from the field in the second half, but ultimately fell short, finishing the game at 35 percent on field goals and 6-31 from three-point territory.
“Tonight, we just all happened to be cold,” sophomore guard Katie Benzan said. “We just have to move on and think about the next game and get back to work.”
Saturday’s loss dropped the Crimson to 1-5 in true road games, a trend the team will have to fix if it hopes to qualify for the Ivy League tournament in March.
Although a mid-week tilt with out of conference La Salle looms on Wednesday, Harvard will also be looking forward to its next Ivy League matchup. That game will come in the form of a rematch against the Big Green, a chance to avenge Saturday’s defeat, at Lavietes Pavilion on the 20th.
“We’re very frustrated, angry, and disappointed about how we played tonight,” Benzan said. “We all want it to be January 20th, playing Dartmouth again. We’re so hungry for a win, and to prove that tonight was a fluke, and that how we played isn’t who we are.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seeing its first action in the rink in 2018, the Harvard women’s ice hockey team (8-5-1, 6-3-1 ECACH) split the weekend in New York, edging out Rensselaer (7-10-4, 4-4-1) on Friday and then falling to Union (6-13-3, 4-6) on Saturday.
UNION 3, HARVARD 1
In its second showdown of the weekend, the Crimson fell to the Dutchwomen 3-1 in Schenectady, N.Y., in a game in which sophomore goalkeeper Beth Larcom recorded the 500th save of her career. The mark came in the game’s scoreless first period.
After a defensive battle in the first, Union notched the game’s first goal off a wrist shot from junior defensemen Arianna Kosakowski six minutes into the second period. A little over four minutes later, the Dutchwomen added another goal past Larcom on the power play, this time from sophomore forward Cheyenne Harris cleaning up a loose puck in front of the net. Taking a 2-0 lead into the final period was enough for Union to hold on, as freshman goalie Coco Francis came up big for the Dutchwomen, stopping 29 of Harvard’s 30 shots on the game.
The Crimson countered in the third period with a goal from senior captain and forward Haley Mullins. However, with time expiring in the game and Harvard down 2-1, Union padded its lead as Harris collected her second goal of the game when she sent a shot through the the Crimson’s empty net.
Union converted one of three of its power play opportunities, while Harvard was unable to capitalize on any of its three chances.
“Tonight didn’t go as expected, but I think we started the game off really well tonight and unfortunately couldn’t keep it for an entire 60 minutes,” junior captain and forward Kate Hallett said. “But like our coach always says, we’re going to lick our wounds and get ready for the next battle.”
Hallett said she is looking forward to what the rest of the season will offer for the team.
“We’re a young team, but we’re a really close-knit group, and I think that with that, the possibilities are endless,” Hallett said. “It’s just going to be about showing up to play at the rink every single day, whether it be a practice or a game, so I’m excited to see where this team can take our talent and our camaraderie, and if we put our minds to it, we’re going to see a lot of success.”
HARVARD 2, RENSSELAER 1
In the first weekend matchup of the weekend, the Crimson emerged victorious in a gritty comeback win over the Engineers, 2-1, in Troy, N.Y.
Rensselaer recorded the first goal of the game after Harvard was penalized for hooking minutes into the contest. RPI junior forward Jaimie Grigsby cleaned up a rebound to give the Engineers the 1-0 advantage. The goal gave Grigsby her fifth power play goal of the season.
However, the Crimson bounced back before the first intermission on a goal off the stick of freshman forward Becca Gilmore, assisted by a quick pass from sophomore forward Kat Hughes.
“The play started with Katherine Hughes making an all-out effort on backcheck,” Gilmore said. “We had a lot of good opportunities throughout that period, so just a good hustle play and a heads up look gave me a pretty good opportunity to get on the board with a 1-on-1 with the goalie.”
Harvard tallied another goal with less than a minute to go in the second period, this one off a power play when freshman forward Keely Moy cleaned up a loose puck in front of the crease. This turned out to be the winning goal, as goalkeeper Larcom would stop 25 Rensselaer shots en route to her third straight win.
“We got a lot of chances and generated a lot of opportunities we wanted and played Harvard hockey,” Gilmore said. “So we were pretty happy with how the team performed especially after the first period, getting the rust off.”
Besides the team’s rigorous winter training, Gilmore said that she attributes the success of the team to strong camaraderie.
“Just to keep the competitiveness up between all of us and to play a full 60,” Gilmore said. “We have a lot of great opponents coming up, and we’re going to have to show up for every minute of every shift. That’s going to be huge for our team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fresh off a winter training trip to Hawaii and in its first meet of the new year, the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team (4-0, 3-0 Ivy) maintained its perfect dual meet record with a close 155-143 upset victory at No. 10 Arizona State (2-2, 1-1 Pac-12).
“We knew that ASU was ranked top 10 in the nation,” junior Logan Houck said. “We are a top 25 team, ranked about 25th, and we were obviously a little nervous, but optimistic because we were coming off a great training trip in Hawaii, so we knew we were in really good shape and we knew we had a really good chance to give these guys a good meet and to really race hard.”
The Crimson swam strongly from the outset, edging out the Sun Devils in the 200-yard medley relay. Harvard’s unit of sophomore Dean Harris, junior Sebastian Lutz, senior Steven Tan, and graduated senior Paul O’Hara finished in a time of 1:28.64, beating out Arizona State’s A relay, which finished in 1:29.12.
Juniors Brennan Novak and Houck continued the Crimson’s momentum with first and second place finishes in the 1000-yard freestyle. Novak maintained 50s in the low 27s on his way to a 9:03.25 finish; Houck touched the wall in 9:10.66.
“We have a really strong distance group here at Harvard and a really great training group,” Novak said. “We’re all pretty dog-tired, and we knew it was going to be tough to race through the pain, but we knew that we wanted this win, and we knew we had to edge out some of their swimmers. After a really tough 10 days of training, we have a lot confidence and a lot of faith in the process.”
Sophomore Dean Farris took first in the 200-yard freestyle by almost two seconds with a time of 1:36.72. However, the Sun Devils took the next two events, the 100-yard backstroke and 100-yard breaststroke, both with first and second place finishes. Sophomore Zach Poti finished in 47.82 for the 100-yard backstroke and senior Christian Lorenz finished in 54.94 in the 100-yard breaststroke.
Harvard rebounded in the 200-yard fly; freshman Michael Zarian finished almost 2 seconds in front of Arizona State freshman Dylan Boyd in a time of 1:50.15. The Crimson then dominated the 50-yard freestyle with a sweep of the top three places. Tan emerged victorious with a time of 20.26, and senior Ed Kim and O’Hara finished with times of 20.58 and 20.64 respectively.
Farris continued his winning ways in the 100-yard freestyle, finishing with a time of 43.96 to beat Arizona State sophomore Cameron Craig’s 44.34 mark. Poti of the Sun Devils added another victory himself in the 200-yard backstroke, in which he touched the wall in 1:45.29, more than two seconds faster than the rest of the field. Arizona State sophomore Ben Olszewski won the 500-yard freestyle in 4:26.68, while Tan went on to win the 100-yard fly in 47.64. Sun Devils freshman Grant House countered with his own win in the 200-yard individual medley, finishing in 1:47.97.
In diving, Sun Devils Youssef Selim won both the one meter and three meter diving events, with scores of 389.25 and 394.05, respectively.
In an exciting culmination of the meet, Harvard’s 400-yard freestyle relay of Kim, freshman Mahlon Reihman, Tan, and Farris edged out Arizona State by half a second in 2:58.20; Farris anchored the relay with a fast 42.91.
“When it came down to it, we were able to have enough in the tank to barely edge them out; it was only a 12-point win,” Houck said. “But we were extremely excited with that, and it means a lot for us and our confidence, I think, going into the last couple meets of the season and, of course, Ivy League Championships.”
Senior captain Bobby Ross expressed that the team’s rigorous two-a-day practice schedule in Hawaii paid dividends in terms of the team’s work ethic.
“Our coach said it pretty well before and after the meet,” Ross said. “He said, ‘You control your effort and you can control your attitude,’ and that’s basically what we did a really good job of. We really maintained a high attitude and really just maintained high effort.”
Ross added that the team should be confident but not too comfortable with their success.
“Momentum-wise, we’re trying to take this win and not make us complacent, but [make us more] confident moving forward through the season, so just [believing] in ourselves as a team that can beat a top-10 team in the country,” Ross said.
