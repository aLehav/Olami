KAZAN, Russia—“Katie Ledecky? Sister?”
A 10-year-old Russian boy raises his eyebrows into a disbelieving grin and points at me.
“Sister, Katie Ledecky!”
He turns to his young friend and speaks in excited tones, repeating my surname with its original Slavic pronunciation. He turns back to me again, tapping his cheek.
“I want kiss Katie Ledecky.”
“Hey, you better watch it,” I shoot back with a smile.
His friend pipes up.
“Number One fan, Katie Ledecky!” he proclaims slowly, gesturing at himself with his right arm, which is wrapped in a gauze cast. He then quickly revises his statement.
“Wait—not Number One fan; Number One fan, family.”
It’s my penultimate day at Kazan Arena, and my 18-year-old sister is in line to make history. With a win tonight, Katie Ledecky will become the first woman to win four individual gold medals in a single World Swimming Championships, completing a unique sweep of all freestyle events 200 meters and over. She’s seeded first in the 800-meter freestyle, an event she hasn’t lost since she was at least 13.
“You can be Number Two fan,” I tell the boy. “Cheer hard for her in the 800!”
As I exit the concourse and rejoin my parents and uncle in the prefabricated stands overlooking the competition pool, I replay the brief exchange in my head and laugh to myself. Just five days earlier, the home crowd did not seem particularly interested in watching Katie swim. There were no Russian entries for the prelims of the women’s 1500-meter freestyle, so most local spectators vacated the future World Cup soccer stadium before the final heat. Yet the thousand or so who stayed found a swimmer from a different country to support. As Katie maintained contact with her pace, the voice of the arena’s Russian public address announcer grew faster and higher. A section at the far end of the pool got behind her with thunder sticks and the air began to buzz. As she climbed out of the pool with a new world record in tow, several local fans approached me for photos.
Three years have passed since Katie has won her Olympic gold medal, but I’m still getting used to the idea of her as an international sports star. In most ways, she’s the same person who joined the neighborhood swim team with me just over 12 years ago. She approaches life with a humble and happy personality and attacks her craft with a single-minded focus. She has a natural love for the water that can come out during meet warm-ups, in which she might briefly roll onto her back and perform some synchronized swimming-like sculls as she tries to wave to her family members in the stands.
At about 7 p.m. Moscow Time, Katie steps onto her starting block for the 800. She calmly runs through her pre-start routine—three short handclaps followed by three shoulder nudges into her goggle sockets as she crouches down into her mark. From the start, she’s the quickest off the blocks and establishes a body-length lead by 100 meters. She rides high in the water with a distinctive gallop as her legs create minimal resistance. By 400 meters, I know that she’s on the way to her 10th career world record.
It’s hard to describe how I feel when I watch Katie set a global mark. I lose a little sense of awareness and yell in a voice that sounds like a dying dog when it’s played back to me. If you’re a hockey fan, think about how you feel when your favorite team scores a Game 7 overtime goal, stretch that feeling over four to 15 minutes, and then multiply that feeling by 10. Despite all the yards I have logged in the pool, I can only imagine how Katie feels. After lowering her 1500 mark for a second time this week, she looked skyward and pointed upwards. She told reporters afterwards that she “dug deep” after her mind drifted to our deceased grandfathers during the race.
After 6,150 meters of racing on the week (over 67 football fields, according to the good folks at NBC), Katie can finally leave it all in the pool. At the final turn, she whips out six underwater dolphin kicks into a furious whitewater sprint to the finish. The wake between her and the red line superimposed on the arena video board grows visibly larger. I clumsily try to capture her final strokes with my camera before I swing my head around to the results board. When I see her time, I can muster only two words.
“Holy crap.”
I will always be my sister’s Number One fan.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the beginning of my semester abroad in Delhi, I entered the Metro station for the first time and I saw to my right a hot pink sign, decorated in flowers and displaying a stick figure woman. She was wearing that public bathroom classic, the triangle skirt, a style that few American or Indian women actually sport. I laughed, reading this "Women Only" sign, and snapped a photo to send home. I thought, “What a hilarious collection of stereotypes! What a silly, paternalistic notion to have a separate train car for females!”
Shortly afterwards, I rode the train. I got on the women's car, close to the accordion-like connector, and felt ten pairs of male eyes on me from the next car. I quickly deployed my tried and tested strategy for getting rid of creeps: A stern look. It seems silly in retrospect, but on the streets of Boston, it's all I've ever needed. However, on this occasion, my glare fell flat, and if anything, I was just met with more curiosity, more stares, and more examination from the men in the car next door. I moved down the train and internally thanked the Delhi Metro for that pink sign and this car.
The pink, flowery sign made clear to foreigners and illiterate metro riders what I quickly learned—that the women's car was an oasis, a refuge from the rest of Delhi, where some men felt no shame in staring at me, following me, or even trying to grab me while I walked down the street.
In Cambridge, it's safe to say we have no need for a women-only car on the T. Women are very safe moving around the Boston area the vast majority of the time. However, there are places where women aren't always safe: A final club or frat house, a bar, or a city street after midnight.
Activists rightly assert that rape is never the victim’s fault, that we should focus on teaching men not to rape rather than outlining preventative strategies for women. And there is clear evidence showing that prevention programs that educate men are definitely the best solution. However, it’s also important to be realistic about the world we live in today. Rape prevention strategies for women can be empowering, and it is urgent that we use them when they prove effective.
The New York Times recently published a story about a very useful rape prevention program in Canada. The program trained female freshman university students in specific and practical strategies to avoid rape. The training focused on role-playing and awareness about the use of alcohol and roofies; it also included physical defense tactics suitable to acquaintance rape situations.
The risk of attempted rape was lowered from 10 percent in a control group to 5 percent for those women who completed the training. While the fact that 5 percent of trained women experienced an attempted rape their freshman year is a harrowing reality, a program that might cut the rate of sexual assault in half is certainly worth pursuing.
A lifeguard is more prepared to respond to an emergency situation on the beach because they've practiced how to react: They can remember a series of steps and implement them in a crisis. Similarly, rape prevention training for women can help women escape dangerous situations because they've already practiced doing so. Personally, I've attended CARE workshops about recognizing dangerous situations and bystander intervention; I’ve also been practicing with Harvard Krav Maga since my sophomore year, and both have helped me feel much safer.
