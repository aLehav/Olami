After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With words like clay and a teflon personality, the social networker is out there, lurking around Harvard Yard. They’re seen at every major event, they give you a wave and shout your name from across the street, they talk about the weather and classes but never anything deeper. They skim the surface of every topic expertly, leaving a trail of ice-breakers and platitudes in their wake. They know you, but they don’t know you, and that doesn’t really matter.  Your name and a smile—swift, undirected—is the gate ticket to anything and everything they need. Anything else is merely decorative, a lozenge to make these actions tasteless, medicinal, and bleached—but even still, when you walk away, something doesn’t feel right. You feel a coat hanger at once peeling your mouth open and wiring your shoulders stiff, the cold metal rippling through your back like bubble wrap. You dismiss the feeling altogether, you tell yourself you’re overreacting. They’re just being nice. Their business card burns a hole in your back pocket.
But can we blame the master networker?
Coming into Harvard, the wow-factor and potential of future greatness never seem to lose their glimmer. The mansplainer in your math class could very well be the next start-up genius or a Nobel Laureate (just not today, because he’s busy today reiterating Green’s Theorem to you in tandem with the TF). The girl across from you in the dining hall could be winning a Fulbright unknowingly as she follows the motions of yet another working dinner. It is, frankly, awe-inspiring that the people who surround you on a daily basis are without a doubt going to change the world in the future. Subconscious consumer behavior propels us into action since, to get the most “bang out of our buck” of our time here, so to speak, we must align ourselves with said fellow students in order to fully reap the benefits of our education.
Yet, these hollow attempts to string together human capital as objects and use them for personal gain amount to nothing but little more than loose interactions too thin to grasp. The truly menacing nature of the networker is not that he or she endeavors to remember every name in the room, but that this endeavor is overall unfruitful and comes across as disingenuous, working against the networker’s original intention. In the end, the efforts of the social networker are not only futile, but are rather obvious and parasitic to the other party involved.
If anything, the idea of networking could have an adverse effect on the way in which you perceive yourself and how others perceive you. Two studies conducted in 2014 showed that participants found a causal relationship between networking events, dirtiness, and the need to be cleaned. Although networking can be marginally beneficial in organization, other studies have shown that a meritocratic system and recognizing organizational achievements are not only useful but are a more effective way to find success in your field. There’s even a sociological theory termed “The Matthew Effect” that connects achievement to cumulative advantages irrespective of networking.
Friendships hold meaning. Real connections are what merit the worthiness of lending an opportunity to someone else, not the memorization of the rote facts of you muddled together in a shallow, haphazard attempt to chain yourself to someone else’s success. A string of aimless conversations and interactions leads nowhere, holds no weight to the development of actual relationships with others around you that lead to mutual gain.
This is not a tirade against small talk, nor an attack attempting to clip the wings of the social butterfly. Friendships have to begin somewhere, and the chitchat and blather aforementioned can be one’s needle and thread to tie people together. If these friendships lead to job opportunities and advancements in a certain field, then that’s great. However, if the intentions are merely to use another person for their capacity to “make it big” in the future without any regard to the person whom is being used, then the actions of the networker are absolutely superficial and leech-like.
Nonetheless, the social networker will continue to exist in their niche here on campus. The smog of competition and ruthless efforts to be on top clogs the arteries just sufficiently so that rationality fails to reach the brain, and students suffocate on this need to use others. Despite the perseverance of the social networker, this mentality does not have to insert doubt into every one of your Harvard friendships. If the LinkedIn request doesn’t come within the first twenty-four hours of meeting them, chances are you’ve dodged the bullet this time.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This is part four in a series of op-eds by members of Harvard student groups welcoming the Class of 2021 to campus.
To the Class of 2021:
Though we would sometimes prefer for it to happen suddenly, change is more often gradual. The process of making Harvard College more inclusive is a prime example.
Harvard College admitted its first students in 1636. It did not admit a black undergraduate until it admitted Beverly Garnett Williams in 1847. Williams, however, never matriculated here: He died just before the 1847-48 school year. After Williams’s death, the College didn’t accept another black student until Richard Theodore Greener was admitted; Greener became the first African American to graduate from Harvard College in 1870. Of course, no African American women attended Harvard until Harvard and Radcliffe merged in 1977, though Alberta V. Scott was the first black woman to graduate from Radcliffe (in 1898). Until the 1970s, Harvard College admitted fewer than 12 black undergraduates each year; only in recent years has the percentage of black undergraduates enrolled approached the percentage of black Americans.
According to demographic data, black people have finally reached equality at Harvard: the admitted Class of 2021 is 14.6 percent black whereas the U.S. population is 13.3 percent black. For that, the University should pat itself on the back. But numbers are not all there is to inclusion. To be included as part of an institution such as Harvard would mean having full access to everything it has to offer. That includes knowing how to access those resources, whether it’s knowing how to network or how to impress a professor or TF so they’ll write you a glowing recommendation letter upon request.
Inclusion also means not being subject to prejudice. This means not being accused of taking a spot from another applicant, as if black students are gifted spots through affirmative action. It means not being asked if you can read. It means not being asked if you speak African when you state your heritage—never mind that Africa is a continent with over 1,000 spoken languages. It means not being asked to speak for the experiences of all black people in section.  It also means not having to hear that one kid in section defend the free speech rights of people literally opposed to your existence as their equals—namely, white supremacists and neo-Nazis—as if hate speech should fall under free speech and deserve protection.
The toll navigating Harvard without a road map takes isn’t always visible, nor is the toll taken by dealing with microaggressions daily. They are felt all the same. If you’re a black Harvard student, you will likely at some point feel like Harvard isn’t meant for you—that you would have been happier somewhere else. Such feelings arise in students of all races, but as a black student, you will have to deal with the feeling that your discontent is because you are black, and Harvard was never meant for black people.
But when those feelings emerge, remember these three things. First, you deserve your spot here. Second, given that you deserve to be here, you are entitled to feel that you belong here. And third, there are other students here who can sympathize with those feelings.
That’s more or less why black student organizations exist here. The dozen or so active black student organizations were all created at least in part so black students could find homes in them. Kuumba, BlackCAST, and KeyChange were also created with the goal of giving voice to black voices and creativity. Harvard Society of Black Scientists and Engineers and Black Pre-Law Association were chartered as pre-professional organizations. Some black organizations were created to serve specific groups: black men, black women, Africans, Nigerians, West Indians. Regardless of the target communities of each of these groups, they were created in hopes that anyone who wanted to be part of their community would feel welcomed, accepted, and supported.
Sometimes we approach that ideal. Too often, however, we fall short in various ways. Our communities sometimes inadvertently promote narrow constructions of masculinity and femininity. They also don’t do enough to support international students in their transition to the United States and a different academic system. Once we accidentally scheduled major events for two black organizations at the same time, making people feel like they had to choose between two parts of themselves. Each year, we have events that cost a lot of money or require formal clothes that community members might not have or be able to afford. Sometimes, much like Harvard, we unintentionally exclude the very students we aim to include.
Missteps, however, have never been reason to stop pursuing a goal. We write as presidents and a vice president of black organizations to say that just as this school is yours, so is this community. This remains true no matter how many or how few meetings you attend, and no matter how many black students you block with. One of the hardest parts of Harvard is finding your place; we hope you find yours, whether it’s in a black student group or somewhere else.

Matthew Moore ’19, president of the Black Men’s Forum, is a Government concentrator in Mather House.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a classic case of Godwin’s Law, free speech absolutists are often asked if they would they would let Nazis demonstrate in public. No one, of course, wants to defend Nazis, but free speech is important because the clash of ideas across the political spectrum helps us determine the best ones. To censor any one group is to give the means to censor any.
The far-right Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va. this August, for example, illustrates how that sentiment can be twisted. The alt-right had already risen to prominence with its stridently anti-political correctness stance, framing so-called PC culture as the opposite of free speech. White nationalists at the event lamented that their free speech rights are being disrespected, further highlighting the tradition of white supremacists “[relying] on liberal democratic ideas about opposition to tyranny” in order to enter the political mainstream.
It is in this political climate that the Harvard College Open Campus Initiative hosted the second of the two speakers previewed last April, Charles A. Murray ’65. As expected, Murray’s controversial book “The Bell Curve” caused students to protest the event held this past Tuesday.
This isn’t to say that Charles A. Murray ’65 or the members of the Open Campus Institute are white supremacists. Rather, the reaction to the Murray talk highlights the difficulty of discerning the motives of those who defend their position by invoking their right to speak. Although we have commented on past instances of this defense and its relation to the principle of free speech, discussions about freedom of speech are made even murkier and more pressing with Nazis demonstrating in public.
While the OCI represents an opportunity to broaden campus discourse, they are squandering their potential to be the forum for free speech by exclusively acting as a conservative platform. Both of the guests have been right-wing speakers criticized on college campuses for their positions on marginalized communities, and an upcoming panel on freedom of speech looks to focus on college campuses given the speaker selection.
Given these events and OCI’s stated goal of testing the limits of the Harvard community’s free speech values, it seems that OCI is primarily interested in the challenging the liberal campus orthodoxy and campus leftism more generally. Though we stand by our assertion that OCI has “potential value” in creating campus discourse, they must change course in their selection of speakers if they are to truly promote free speech ideals on campus. OCI can bill themselves as a conservative speakers club or club testing the limits of speech, but not both.
While the former has its benefits, it would truly be a shame if we lost the latter. OCI clearly has the right to invite whomever they wish, just as the rest of the community has the right to criticize them accordingly. However, to shrug off the concerns of the marginalized in the name of freedom of speech while continuing to invite offensive, right-wing speakers is to polarize the principle rather than convince the community of its value. Casting the liberal student body as against free speech for its “political correctness” will only incite further cynicism towards free speech proponents.
Moreover, OCI remains myopic in its concerns regarding freedom of speech as the issue extends beyond college campuses and matters of political correctness. For example, can privately-owned websites deny services on the basis of their patrons’ views? If OCI seeks to spark dialogue, it should look to invite provocative speakers across the political spectrum, such as those who have been harassed by conservatives. Perhaps Lisa Durden, the professor who was fired for making left-wing comments on a Fox News appearance, would be worth inviting.
If OCI seeks to foster debate, it should look to host debates between opposing speakers and give more time for Q&A. If OCI seeks to champion free speech, it should be more than just a right-wing voice. They have the potential to do so, but until they begin inviting individuals from both sides of the political spectrum, OCI should be careful in waving the banner of free speech.

UPDATED: September 11, 2017 at 7:28 p.m.
Six months after Harvard Law School announced it would begin to accept the Graduate Record Examination in addition to the traditional Law School Acceptance Test, two other elite law schools have followed suit even as some question whether the two exams are in fact interchangeable.
Harvard was only the second law school in the country to begin accepting the GRE, a test traditionally taken for admission to non-professional graduate school programs. In August, Northwestern and Georgetown’s law schools announced that they would also begin to allow applicants to submit the GRE. All three schools said the move was intended to make the law school application process more accessible to a diverse group of prospective students.
“I’ve heard people chatter about this for some time now. This is sort of emerging as a more visible issue, but it’s been on the table, and I think it takes courage to break herd,” said Peter F. Lake ’81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who specializes in higher education law. “When someone does it who’s recognized as a peer institution it does incentivize others to say ‘we can do it too.’”
Jessica L. Soban ’02, the Law School’s Associate Dean for Strategic Initiatives and Admissions, said Harvard Law has been in contact with other law schools since announcing the policy change.
“We’ve definitely talked with law schools that have been interested in our approach, and we’ve had conversations with them about that,” she said.
In 2016, Harvard conducted a study to to determine whether the GRE served as a similar predictor of first-year law student success as the LSAT. The American Bar Association, which accredits law schools, currently requires that schools wishing to accept a test besides the LSAT must prove that the alternative test is comparably valid.
But with more schools moving to accept the GRE, the ABA is now considering a policy change that would require the ABA, not individual schools, to certify the validity of an LSAT alternative. At a public hearing in July, the ABA received statements on both sides, with some law school deans urging more flexibility in admissions and the administrators of the LSAT supporting greater ABA oversight.
In the meantime, Lake said, for some schools, the GRE’s potential to predict bar exam scores will also be a major factor in choosing whether or not to adopt these testing policies.
“I think people will be looking at that to see if the GRE is equally predictive of bar examination success as the LSAT,” Lake said. “I know people are looking for the magic bullet of improving the number of applicants and the quality of applicants, but they’re also looking for licensing outcomes.”
Beyond the GRE, the Law School has in recent years taken steps to increase its applicant pool in the face of declining law school applications nationwide, including expanding its Junior Deferral Program to all schools and conducting interviews via Skype.

CORRECTION: September 11, 2017
A previous version of this article indicated that Harvard Law School consulted with the University of Arizona before announcing they would accept the GRE. In fact, the consultations took place after the announcement.

Renovations in Lowell House have forced two peer counseling groups, Eating Concerns Hotline and Outreach as well as Response, to seek new spaces on campus for the next two years.
ECHO, a group specializing in body image and eating concerns, and Response, which counsels students on relationship issues, both moved from their old spaces in Lowell basement after ground broke on the House’s renovations this summer.
ECHO is now located in the basement of Eliot House’s L entryway, while Response now joins other peer counseling groups, like Contact and Room 13, in Thayer basement.
Lowell House is undergoing construction as part of an ongoing project to renew and modernize Harvard’s upperclassmen Houses.  Renovations started in June and are set to continue through August 2019, marking the longest construction time on a House so far.
Cassandra S. Hastie ’18, co-director of ECHO, said it was challenging to secure the new Eliot location.
“It was stressful until we were able to nail down a spot,” Hastie said. “However now, it’s pretty smooth at this point.”
Hastie added that her biggest concern was to make sure people knew about the location change.
“I think that really falls on us on pubbing it and making sure people know where to go and putting enough signs and including the information in our posters,” Hastie said.
The groups are hoping to remain accessible to students despite the move. ECHO, located in a House somewhat removed from the center of campus, said they are open to suggestions on how to be most accessible. While ECHO opened its doors Sunday, Response is planning to open next week
Hastie said that the Eliot location will be just as much of a “very welcoming, well-decorated, comfortable space” as the Lowell location was.

Once again, "Economics 10a: Principles of Economics" is the most popular fall course among Harvard undergraduates.
Keeping in line with last fall’s enrollment numbers, Ec10 edged out Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I” as the College's most sought-after class.
According to data released by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences registrar’s office, Ec10a’s 627 undergraduate enrollment surpassed CS50’s 606 undergraduates by 21 students. Last year, the margin was far more narrow; only 6 more students enrolled in Ec10a than CS50.
But in terms of total enrollment, CS50 remains a more popular course than Ec10a. Including graduate students, non-degree students, cross-registered students, visiting undergraduates, and Harvard employees, 697 are currently enrolled in the College’s flagship Computer Science course. Meanwhile, 633 are enrolled in Ec10a.
CS50 rolled out a number of changes this year. By default, the course is now graded on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis by default, and Harvard administrators and CS50 instructors have repeatedly stressed the importance of academic integrity in lectures so far this semester. More than 60 students in the course last year faced academic dishonesty charges.
The College’s third largest course is the perennially popular Statistics 110: “Introduction to Probability,” with 524 undergraduate enrollees. Shortly following in enrollment numbers are Ethical Reasoning 18: “Classical Chinese Ethical and Political Reasoning” and Science of Living Systems 20: “Psychological Science” with 508 and 443 undergraduate enrollees, respectively.
Statistics professor Joseph K. Blitzstein, who teaches Stat110, attributed the course’s popularity to what he described as a growing recognition of the importance of probability.
“I try my best to show that probability is both very interesting and very useful,” Blitzstein wrote in an emailed statement. “Everywhere that there is data, uncertainty, or randomness, we need probability.”
East Asian Languages and Civilizations professor Michael J. Puett, who teaches ER18,  said he believes the General Education course is so popular because it encourages students to confront “big” philosophical questions.
“I think [the course’s materials] really challenge our assumptions: how we can grow as people, how we can become better people,” Puett said. “I think students like to be in an environment where they ask these questions.”
Science of Living Systems 20: Psychological Science saw a huge leap in an enrollment this semester, with 376 more enrollees this semester than in the spring.  The course is taught in the Fall semester by Psychology professor Daniel Gilbert, who said that he could not explain why the course’s enrollment was particularly high this term.
“Professors regard enrollment like weather, we just take it as it comes,” he said.

More than 100 Harvard students declared their candidacy for 44 available seats on the Undergraduate Council ahead of this week’s voting period, according to Matthew C. Estes ’18, who chairs the Council’s Election Commission.
The number of candidates this year—103—marks a one-person uptick from last year’s 102 candidates.
Freshmen comprise most of this year’s candidates with 60 students vying for only 12 spots. The most competitive race will take place in Crimson Yard, where 21 students will compete for three spots. Sixteen students are seeking three spots in Ivy Yard.
In the Houses, the most competitive races will happen in Cabot, Currier, Eliot, and Kirkland Houses, where five students in each of the Houses are seeking three spots. Additionally, in Pforzheimer House, four students are running for two spots.
Meanwhile, non-competitive races will take place in Dudley House, Dunster House, Quincy House, Lowell House, Adams House, Winthrop House, and Mather House.
UC President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 said she thinks the current political climate in the world and on campus makes it important for people to get involved in student government.
“Especially in times like now, where there’s so many things going on in our world and on Harvard’s campus...we should speaking up and representing our peers,” she said.
The election period begins on Monday at 12 p.m. and ends on Friday at 12 p.m. Winners will be announced Friday afternoon. The new Council will first convene on Sept. 24, when they will likely pass an annual budget.

As students put the finishing touches on their dorms, the Harvard Art Museums are offering an opportunity to supplement posters and string lights with notable artwork.
Run by the art museums, the Student Print Rental Program allows students staying in campus housing to rent a print for the academic year. Students may select from a collection of over 250 works of art that include well-known artists such as Pablo Picasso, Joan Miró, and Andy Warhol.
According to Associate Curator of Prints Elizabeth M. Rudy, the curatorial staff evaluates the program’s existing collection every summer, choosing “interesting” pieces in good condition.
“We’re also looking for prints that are very fresh—that is to say, very contemporary—that we think would be inspiring for students to live with for a year,“ Rudy said.
New this year is a discounted rental price: citing a desire to increase the program’s accessibility, overseer of the program Jessica M. Diedalis lowered the rental price from $50 to $30. Students unable to afford the price saw their fee waived.
“We hoped this adjustment would reach a broader audience in the Harvard community so that more people could enjoy art in their living spaces and really make it a part of their everyday lives,” Diedalis said.
According to Diedalis, the program saw a “really great, positive response” this year and ran out of prints by 2:30 p.m. on the second day of the rental period. The museums offered last-minute rentals during the Harvard Student Late Night at the art museums Thursday, when dozens more students showed up.
Several attendees said that they were hoping to take advantage of Harvard’s resources by participating in the program.
“We thought it would add a nice touch to our room and also make good use of Harvard’s resources,” said Nazeli I. Hagen ’21, who attended the Late Night event with her roommates. “How often can you say you have an actual piece of art in your room for only 30 dollars?”
Justin J. Hancock ’21, who also attended Late Night, said that he was looking to add some decoration to his Thayer dorm room.
“I think it’s really important to create an atmosphere of having a room be some place that you want to live in, and so having this amazing art in your room really provides life to the room,” Hancock said.

University President Drew G. Faust called for a legislative replacement for an imperiled  program protecting undocumented young people in a televised interview Friday.
Speaking on CBS This Morning, Faust described a time early in her presidency when a group of undocumented students came to meet with her. She said the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program gave them a “measure of relief” from fear and uncertainty.
"I do hope there will be an act that will protect these students, but in the meantime they're now cast back into tremendous uncertainty and anxiety,” Faust said, citing the DREAM Act as one piece of legislation that would “solve this problem.”
Last week, Faust denounced President Donald Trump’s decision to repeal DACA in six months as “cruel” in an email to Harvard affiliates, and outraged students and faculty have protested the move. Thirty-one professors from Harvard and area universities were arrested Thursday in a planned act of civil disobedience against the decision.
Faust also fielded questions about Title IX and campus sexual assault. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos announced last week that the Department of Education would review Title IX guidelines that previously led Harvard and other schools to alter their policies, a move that concerned anti-sexual assault activists at Harvard.
Calling Harvard’s sexual assault and harassment policy “really robust,” Faust said, “Sexual assault is an issue that we’ve attended to very carefully, especially in recent years, because we’ve realized the dimensions of the problem on our campus.”
A 2015 campus sexual conduct climate survey found that 31 percent of senior undergraduate females in the College had experienced some form of sexual assault in their time at Harvard, findings Faust at the time called “deeply disturbing.”
“A lot of individuals were not even seeking help. We want people to seek help, at a minimum, if they feel they have experienced this,” Faust said on CBS. “We need a policy that supports that, and also is a policy that operates in a just way.”x
In 2014, the Law School was found to be in violation of Title IX after a Department of Education review found it had “failed to comply with Title IX's requirements for prompt and equitable response” in two student cases. The College is currently under investigation for its handling of sexual assault cases.

On Friday, the No. 7 Harvard Radcliffe Women’s Rugby club opened its season with a 61-0 blowout win against No. 9 West Chester University in West Chester, Penn. The victory gives the Crimson a 6-0 series history, a 2-0 series history at West Chester, as well as a season opening win for the second consecutive year.
“We were feeling pretty good walking in,” sophomore Dominique Cantave said. “We had been working on a new attack plan, and we were really excited about testing it out against a team in our league. I was personally excited to see the team chemistry at work, because we have a couple of new players that have integrated seamlessly into our dynamic.”
The game began with a tense and scoreless first ten minutes before Harvard broke to open scoring with junior tighthead Akweley “Q” Okine earning her first try of the season, bringing the Crimson to 5-0. Sophomore flyhalf Delia Hellander then converted to bring the score to 7-0.
“First 10 or 15 minutes were definitely hard fought,” sophomore Emily Prentice said. “We were pretty evenly matched. Our prop Akweley Okine made a great 50m break by working off the ball and receiving a good offload which turned the pace of the game offensively. And two of our freshmen on the wing, Sabrina [Kim] and Milan [Roberts] had great speed on defense and some big hits in the first few minutes that set the pace for defense.”
With the Crimson rolling on all cylinders, the team didn’t look back as the scoring continued when sophomore Dominique Cantave maneuvered to earn a try, her first of two during the match. The team unsuccessfully attempted a conversion, keeping the score at 12-0 Harvard. As the Crimson continued to add to its lead, its offense was able to expand along with strong defensive support, opening up the opportunity for more players to begin scoring.
Junior flanker Ginny Miller fought out of a lineout maul to score a try to bring another five points for the Crimson, 17-0. Hellander secured a try heading into the half, but Harvard was not done scoring before the break as freshman wing Roberts opened her Crimson scoring sheet with a score before the whistle.
With four different players scoring in the first half, Harvard headed into the halftime break with a 27-0 advantage over the Rams.
“In rugby each phase is like starting over,” senior captain Learned said. “Each phase is a new opportunity to test what we have been practicing. Focusing on that aspect of rugby keeps us all very focused throughout the game.”
After halftime, the Crimson maintained that focus from the first half to continue dominating the game. Cantave scored her second try of the game to bring the score to 32-0, leading the Crimson’s scoring with ten points.
With the flood gates open in the second half, Learned earned a try, and was followed by junior Caitlin Weigel scoring a successful conversion to bring Harvard to 39-0. Weigel then added to the Harvard tally with a score and a conversion for 46-0 Harvard. The Crimson continued to find holes in the West Chester defense as Okine scored from an offload without a successful conversion for 51-0. T
he final score of the game was capped off by freshman wing Kim to give Harvard a 61-0 victory over the Rams.
The Crimson defense ended the match with a blank sheet after the strong display against West Chester prevented even a single score against the Crimson. By the end of the game, ten different Harvard players contributed to the scoring effort with six different players scoring in the second half alone
“It gives us a good platform to build off of this season,” sophomore Camille Bean said, “and it's a great confidence-booster for the team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
No. 10 Harvard Men’s water polo (5-2, 0-0 Ivy League) went three for three on the weekend, defeating east coast opponents No. 17 George Washington (4-3, 0-0 Atlantic-10) and Chapman (1-3, 0-0 Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference)on Saturday, and No. 16 Bucknell (1-6, 0-0 Patriot League) on Sunday at the annual Princeton Invite. The Crimson had a dominating Saturday performance, outscoring George Washington and Chapman by a combined total of 13 goals. Competition was tighter on Sunday as Harvard edged out Bucknell by only one goal.
“I thought we did a good job of taking steps forward,” head coach Ted Minnis said. “I thought this weekend and the way the schedule was set up and having Bucknell as our third game was tough. The last time we played Bucknell was a sudden death victory for us. We had to focus on a very good GW team and a very good Chapman team and stay composed and get through those games so that we could really battle with Bucknell.”
HARVARD 10, BUCKNELL 9
Harvard opened up the game against Bucknell with a goal from junior Nathan Ondracek. The score was close the entirety of the game, and sophomore Austin Sechrest scored late in the final hour to clinch the victory. Sechrest had an impressive offensive performance against the Bison as his game winning goal was his fourth of the game.
“We played Bucknell last year in NCAA so it’s kind of turned into a rivalry game,” co-captain Harry Tafur said. “They have a lot of great players and a good coach so it was really a team win.”
At the beginning of the fourth quarter the game was tied 8-8. Freshman and reigning Northeast Water Polo Conference Rookie of the Week Dennis Blyashov scored the Crimson’s ninth goal ahead of Sechrest’s game-winner to ensure a Harvard victory. Freshman Bruno Snow led the team defensively with five steals, and Blyashov added two of his own. Overall, Harvard recorded twelve steals spread amongst seven players to hold Bucknell and seal the win 10-9.
HARVARD 14, GEORGE WASHINGTON 8
The first half of the match was neck-and-neck with both the Crimson and the Colonials entering halftime with four one the board. Harvard pulled away in the second half scoring ten goals to George Washington’s four.
The second half offensive surge was led by Sechrest. Sechrest scored three times across the last two quarters. Co-captain Colin Chiapello also scored a hat trick of his own to contribute to the Crimson victory.
The strong offensive performance was only made possible due to a stronger defense. Ondracek, Snow, and freshman Jackson Enright all collected three steals a piece. Ondracek three steals all came in the fourth quarter and each of them resulted in a Harvard goal. Between the posts junior Anthony Ridgley had a solid performance, recording 11 saves for the Crimson.
HARVARD 17, CHAPMAN 10
The second game of the day against Chapman felt a lot like the morning’s. The Crimson again tacked on ten goals in the last two quarters to secure their victory by seven goals.
“We had a really good season last year and teams are showing up to play us,” Minnis said. “At the beginning of games people are fresh. They are playing well and they have adrenaline. I think we know that we have to settle down and get into the flow of the game and start to try and dictate the tempo and pace and it takes a little time to do that. Our conditioning really comes into effect then.”
Harvard’s offense was hot in the first quarter, propelling the team to a 6-4 early lead. The offense was unable to find its footing in the second and Chapman was able to close the gap to 7-6 Harvard before halftime.
The Crimson regrouped in the break and came back in the third quarter with five goals while allowing Chapman only one. Harvard banged out five more goals in the fourth to secure the win.
Blyashov had another standout performance scoring five goals against Chapman to make it seven on the day. Sophomore Nikhil Suri played the entire game in the net and recorded 11 saves.
“All three games were pretty good,” Tafur said. “It’s good to have three wins after going 2-2 last weekend. So we are pretty happy about that. We just need to get back to work starting tomorrow.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Returning home after its West Coast trip, the No. 18 Harvard field hockey team (2-2) faced off against No. 2 Connecticut (5-0) in the team’s home opener on Sunday at Berylson Field. The Huskies proved too tough a challenge to overcome, and the Crimson dropped the contest, 3-1.
Coming off a 2-1 record in its opening weekend, the Harvard squad was hoping to build on that momentum as it faced off against a notoriously tough opponent. As a program, Connecticut has a history of sustained success. After winning the NCAA Division I title in 2013 and 2014, the Huskies have maintained strong success in the playoffs, most recently making the semifinals in 2016.
“I think last week showed us we can compete with the top teams in the country,” Harvard coach Tjerk van Herwaarden said. “Today was just another test to see if last week was a one game wonder or if we have the potential to be a top team. We wanted to use this weekend to see where our true potential lay.”
This season, No. 2 Connecticut came into the matchup undefeated. Furthermore, in its last three games, the Huskies won their matchups by a 15-3 goal differential, and the matchup between Harvard and the Huskies resulted in the 4-0 loss for Harvard last year. As a team with NCAA Playoff aspirations, however, the Crimson would need to compete with exactly this kind of competition to succeed.
“We compared this game to last year’s when we played UConn,” van Herwaarden said, “In that matchup, we allowed them to dictate the game. From the first moment today, we wanted to get out there and show them what we were capable of.”
Harvard’s attacking mindset paid almost immediate dividends, as the team controlled the flow play early on. This strategy culminated in an early goal for the Crimson, as junior forward Kathleen Young slotted home the game’s first goal at the four minute mark. Following a scramble near the net, Young managed to control a loose ball and fire off a low shot past the Connecticut goalkeeper.
Following the goal, Harvard managed to control the momentum of the game for a brief period. Small mistakes, however, proved to be the team’s undoing. The Crimson gave away eight penalty corners in the first half, and Connecticut took advantage by scoring three of them in just over ten minutes. Van Heerwarden noted the importance of making mistakes against strong opponents.
“Against these types of teams, the top teams in the country, small mistakes do make a difference,” van Herwaarden said. “These games show us where our room to grow is. We need to be able to guide ourselves towards those finer details against opponents. That’s the next step for us to take.”
The Huskies first goal came in the 20th minute, as Connecticut junior forward Amanda Collins managed to score off of a deflection. Two minutes later off of a penalty corner, the Huskies’ sophomore midfielder Barbara van den Hoogen deflected a shot into the net. Finally, in the 34th minute, Connecticut senior forward Charlotte Veitner tapped in Connecticut’s third goal of the half.
In the second half, both teams played an even game, with neither side able to score. Despite the result, the team was pleased with its efforts and managed to learn from the contest.
“We played a very respected opponent and held our own the entire game,” senior midfielder Hannah Wellington said. “There were mistakes we made that cost us the game. However, they are little mistakes that can be fixed and learned from so that we can succeed in our remaining games.”
Following today’s game, Harvard will face Northeastern and New Hampshire next weekend before kicking off Ivy league play on September 23 againt Yale. In next weekend’s matchups, the team looks to use this matchup against Connecticut to better itself before conference play begins.
“Eventually, all of these games should prepare us in the best way possible for Ivy league play,” van Heerwarden said. “I think we’ve done really well these past few games. New Hampshire and Northeastern are both tough opponents. But we need to prepare and we need to get a result. I think next weekend should be a good final test before we go into Ivy League play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a tense affair Saturday night at Providence College, Crimson freshman Paolo Belloni-Urso trickled a deflected shot past Friars goalkeeper Colin Miller in the 85th minute as the Harvard men's soccer team notched its first win of the season, winning 2-1.
After the teams traded a pair of goals in the first 20 minutes, a chippy game featuring four cautions took over as the teams hunted for the advantage. Providence (2-3-0) fell to ten men in the 42nd minute after midfielder/forward Belloni-Urso went in for a tackle and Friars sophomore defender/midfielder Joao Serrano reacted by kicking the US U-18 national team member, subsequently receiving a straight red card.
Harvard (1-2-0) went into halftime hoping to capitalize on the man advantage by controlling the pace of the game and picking its moments. Providence’ junior goalie Colin Miller stood tough in the face of pressure, tipping away chances from Crimson sophomore forward Phillip Hausen and senior midfielder Christian Sady.
“We were able to play with the ball more and the last couple minutes we were really attacking a lot until we found an opening and we were able to score,” Belloni-Urso said.
As time dwindled down, Belloni-Urso took a feed from Hausen at the top of the penalty book and turned on goal. The shot was deflected by Providence sophomore defender Liam Wilson and went to the right of Miller into the net. The lucky bounce gave the Crimson’s shot leader his first career collegiate goal and stopped the team’s recent skid.
Harvard went into the game hoping not to match the start of its 2014 season, which marked the last time the Crimson went on a three-game losing streak. As an Elite Eight contender last year, Providence served as a formidable opponent, buoyed by a strong offense led by senior forward Mac Steeves.
Harvard scored early in the 8th minute when sophomore midfielder Matthew Glass buried home a deflected header to take the advantage early. But the home team quickly regrouped and challenged with a series of early chances.
The pressure started with a controversial disallowed goal by Providence sophomore midfielder Braden Kline, whose header in the 13th minute was partially blocked by Harvard senior goalie Kyle Parks before bouncing off the bottom left post and safely into Parks’ grasp.
Video evidence suggested the ball may have crossed the plane of the goal, but the referee waved off the play. In any case, Providence became emboldened and continued to push offensively.
Soon after, Steeves headed a cross just wide of frame. But less than two minutes later, the Needham, Mass. native slotted home a deflected cross from six yards out to knot the game at one goal apiece.
“One of our game points was to get pressure to him early and make sure that every header that he gets is contested,” captain defender Justin Crichlow said. “We didn’t do that at all time and that’s when they broke us down, but our coaches did a great job of instructing us on how to play against him.”
Steeves was credited with all three of Providence’s shots on goal, but Harvard’s strategy to challenge the 6’4” striker aerially throughout the game paid dividends and limited the damage to only one goal.
After the early goal, Harvard handled the pressure well, playing it out until the tide turned in the form of the Providence red card. From then on, Harvard looked to run its system and let their newer players rise to the challenge.
“The freshmen, the sophomores, everyone did a fantastic job staying composed, keeping the ball, and just playing Harvard soccer,” Crichlow said. “We really battled last night and I was really impressed by the freshmen and sophomores who really stepped up yesterday.”
Underclassmen including Belloni-Urso, Glass and Hausen provided a youthful spark on offense and moved action to the offense side of the field. This play took pressure off the defense, while creating chances for a winning result that was finally realized in the last ten minutes of play.
“One of our mottos as a team is that we are a team of leaders, so we don’t care if a freshman is the one leading the team,” Crichlow said.
This style of team management helped create a more dynamic environment and welcome the new members of the team.
“We all can give our input and I think that has helped,” Belloni-Urso said. “People with different experiences and people that played in different places have been able to share their part and make the team better.”
The hope is that this mutual leadership culture will translate into a culture of winning, with this win marking the first major step of success this season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s volleyball team put a difficult first weekend on the back burner as it captured its first two wins of the season in its second tournament of the campaign.
At the Holiday Inn Invitational in Ohio this weekend, the Crimson (2-4) defeated Wright State and Tennessee Tech but fell to West Virginia. Although still in the process of making adjustments as it readies itself for Ivy League play in two weeks, Harvard took this weekend as an important morale-booster.
“We played against some really competitive teams this weekend and rose to the occasion,” sophomore setter Erin McCarthy said, “We learned a lot about our team and felt like we played in a cohesive unit. We definitely played in a new and positive way compared to last weekend.”
HARVARD 3, TENNESSEE TECH 0
After splitting the two Friday matchups, Harvard ended the weekend off on the win column through another tight three-set victory.
Although the Golden Eagles (2-7) ended up dropping all three of its games this weekend, this match nevertheless was no walk in the park.
The Crimson and Tennessee Tech were evenly matched in the second set, with the Golden Eagles jumping out to a quick early lead. An impressive comeback led by the offense of Meyer allowed the Crimson to claw back into the set before ultimately emerging victorious at 25-23.
In set three, Harvard fell early on in the set before recovering and capitalizing on multiple errors by the Golden Eagle. Set three finished 25-21 in favor of the Crimson.
“We smoothed out some of our kinks and were just playing a lot more consistently,” McCarthy said. “We felt more comfortable on the court and made some important adjustments to help us end the weekend on a strong note.”
McCarthy, who has established herself as the team’s primary setter this season, notched 36 assists. The Manhattan Beach, Calif. Native looks to continue her role as an important offensive and defensive player for the Crimson, as she finished second in assists and second in digs her freshman season.
Capping off the weekend’s positive play was also impressive individual performances by some of the younger members of the team. Freshman hitter Mindie Mabry appeared in her second game of the season, scoring twelve points for the Crimson.
In addition, sophomore blocker Maclaine Fields won all-Tournament honors through an impressive 23 kills over the course of three games. The 6’3 anchor at the front of the Crimson line also contributed eight blocks in the tournament, bringing her season total up to 12.
WEST VIRGINIA 3, HARVARD 0
Against a tough Big 12 opponent in the Mountaineers, Harvard fell in straight sets and split Friday’s doubleheader. West Virginia (6-2) broke away offensively on all three sets, benefiting from 12 aces.
Six of those aces came in the first set, in which the Mountaineers mounted a 7-0 run at the start of the contest and a 5-0 to cap off the frame at 25-13.
The second set was a much more competitive back-and-forth battle, with the Crimson staying within arm’s reach of the lead before falling 25-21.
Harvard’s offensive output against West Virginia came largely in the hands of two players: sophomore hitter Grace Roberts Burbank and junior co-captain Christina Cornelius, who each finished with seven kills.
Set three saw a more lopsided performance in favor of the victors, as the Mountaineers took advantage of a 11-3 run to start the final set before finishing off the game 25-16.
In contrast to West Virginia’s high kill percentage of 0.304, the Crimson could only capitalize on less than 12 percent of their spikes. This made it difficult not only to put points on the board, but pressure against a Mountaineer backline that finished with 38 digs.
HARVARD 3, WRIGHT STATE 0
Capturing its first win of the season, Harvard shut out the Raiders (3-7) in the tournament’s first game.
All three sets were tight duels, as the Crimson narrowly edged out Wright State 25-23 in the first set, 25-21 in the second set, and 25-23 in the concluding set.
“We were super excited for our second weekend of play, especially with all the improvements we were making,” junior blocker Jocelyn Meyer said, “Key areas we focused on this tournament were on our defense and outside hitting. We were able to mesh more and quicken our offense.”
Meyer, a native of nearby Springboro, Ohio, was able to play in front of a small homecoming crowd in Akron. Against Wright State, Meyer finished with a .500 hitting percentage and 11 kills, both season highs.
Other strong performances came from Cornelius, who notched her first double-double of the season with 10 kills and 11 digs, as well as McCarthy, who had 41 assists, matching her career high.
The Crimson will stay home for its third week, taking on Massachusetts neighbors Boston College, Northeastern, and UMass Lowell in the New England Challenge. This will be the team’s final pre-Ivy League tournament before hosting Dartmouth on Sept. 22.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s soccer team (4-2-0) kicked off its most travel-intensive week of the season this past weekend, heading to central New York to face off against ACC foe Syracuse (5-2-1). Combined with its trip to Pennsylvania this coming Friday, the Crimson will have traveled over 1,200 miles round-trip in just over a week.
Despite the demanding schedule, Harvard featured a lineup in its Sunday afternoon match against the Orange that was nearly identical to the one it sent out onto the field against Boston College on Thursday. The consistency paid off to an extent as the Crimson played one of its best games offensively thus far in the season.
Unlike on Thursday, however, when Harvard scored once off four total shots to secure a 1-0 victory, getting the ball past the opposing goalkeeper proved to be a much more difficult task this time around. Syracuse senior netminder Courtney Brosnan saved all six shots on goal to shutout the Crimson. On the other side of the field, Harvard put the ball into its own net for the deciding own goal.
Just like that, the Crimson saw its three-game win streak snapped at the hands of the Orange, 1-0.  Syracuse improved to 3-1-0 on its current seven-game homestand, while Harvard will have to bounce back quickly with three games in five days later this week.
“We obviously weren’t pleased with the result,” said Crimson captain and midfielder Caroline Chagares. “But I think there’s a lot to like about how we played today, especially against a very good opponent, and we’ll take care of the not-so-good things when we sit down and watch the film.”
The contest started out with chances for both sides, as the teams combined for six corner kick opportunities in the first 15 minutes. Neither got very close to finding the back of the net, however, and Brosnan and Harvard junior goalkeeper Danielle Etzel made clean, routine saves when called upon to do so.
This pattern continued for most of the first half as the teams found shooting space but no clear-cut chances on goal. At intermission, the Orange had tallied seven shots to the Crimson’s five, but the scoreline still stood at 0-0.
Syracuse came out of the break with more attacking intent, putting pressure on Harvard’s defenders and disrupting their back-passes. Ultimately, it was this pressure that produced the only goal of the game, as sophomore goalkeeper Kat Hess mishandled a routine back-pass from Becker.
“It was an unfortunate goal to give up, and unfortunate it ended up being the difference,” Crimson coach Chris Hamblin said. “But we understand that mistakes happen, and I’m glad with how the team responded to come right back and knock on their door at the end of the game.”
Besides this misplay, Harvard’s defense was solid throughout the game, as it has been all season. The unit entered the matchup as the 23rd ranked scoring defense in the country, on a goals per minute basis, and showed why by shutting down the Orange’s potent offense. Despite conceding nine corners, the Crimson closed down on opposing forwards and allowed only four shots on goal.
On the other side of the ball, the Harvard offense displayed a level of chemistry and flow that had been absent in previous games. With the freshman pairing at forward finding their footing six games into the season, the Crimson was able to sustain attacking movements and create quality chances. The result on the scoresheet was a season-high 11 shots over the course of the contest. Six of those were on frame, also a season-high for the team.
“We knew we wanted to come out and get after them on offense,” Chagares said. “And that’s what we did, especially when we had to later in the game - create chances and pressure their goalie.”
Junior midfielder Leah Mohammadi was once again the engine of the offense, accounting for seven of the 11 shots. Mohammadi, who has scored three of Harvard’s four goals thus far in 2017, came closest for her team when she hit the crossbar from a free kick in the 88th minute.
Freshman forward Lauren Raimondo also had a great chance at goal late in the game, in the 86th minute, but her blast from the left side of the box was tipped over the bar by Brosnan.
“Once we went down by a goal, I think the players naturally started to pick up their play and gain some momentum,” Hamblin said. “We sat deep for some parts of the game, but we knew we had to go forward in the last 15 minutes or so. It was just unfortunate that we weren’t able to convert any of the chances we had.”
Though the Crimson did not find the back of the net on Sunday, the team will have plenty of chances to build on the offensive rhythm it developed, particularly towards the end of the game, in the three matchups it has this week.
