After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Apparently, “the best boyband since One Direction” is a genreless hip-hop collective out of San Marcos, Texas. At least that’s what BROCKHAMPTON — a 13-man conglomerate that bridges steely rap and crooning R&B — wanted to convince the audience at this year’s Governors Ball music festival.
A sea of young people camped in front of the venue’s biggest stage, BROCKHAMPTON’s crowd seemed to understand they were about to witness something unique. The audience on Saturday held plenty of rapt, die-hard fans, screaming every word to each song and waiting restlessly for the band to unveil the giant black tarp covering a lump in the center of the stage. But right along with them were people who had no idea what they were getting themselves into, eyes wide with excitement as the band unveiled another trick or launched into another of their strange, dense, and infectious songs.
The very beginning of the set gave little away about what was yet to come. Bearface, the pseudonym of Irish-born vocalist Ciarán McDonald, climbed out solo onto a giant crane. As it lifted above the stage, he sang the soulful intro to “SUMMER,” a closer for the second of their four studio albums.
Bearface kept his eyes mostly closed, his long bangs hanging over an empty expression. A cross between Drake and a more sullen Ed Sheeran, he sings with a unique kind of privacy. Even towering above the crowd, he seems to be performing for just one person. Singing the refrain, “In the heat of the summer, you know that you should be my boy,” he inflected the sparse lines with emotion, clearing the stage for the energy to come.
As Bearface climbed back onstage — to the audience’s wild delight — the tarp finally lifted to reveal a gigantic, metallic gold spaceship. Likely signaling a “new era” in their meticulously-curated branding universe, the spaceship held each of the night’s remaining performers clad in identical silver space suits.
The groupmates sauntered out onstage coyly, until group leader Kevin Abstract grabbed the spotlight and yelled out the first lines of the dance-worthy hit “BOOGIE” off of SATURATION III. Leaping several feet in the air, he grabbed full control of the audience from his first note as they jumped up and down on his command.
The energy was almost exact for the entire hour and 15 minute set. They managed to maintain the all-caps, always-on intensity of their discography by leaning on each other, switching focus to ensure no single member wore out. Variety came not from modulating tone, but, as they moved the spotlight around, from showcasing each member’s individual energy. This variety was on prime display as they used their biggest hit, “BLEACH” to transition to their more contemplative songs about two-thirds of the way into the set. As each member performed a verse about their specific areas of vulnerability, they ricocheted from Matt Chamberlain’s made-for-pop choruses to Merlyn Wood's impromptu, dance-heavy verses, to defiantly-weird, sour raps out of Joba.
Kevin Abstract doesn’t hog the spotlight, but he’s still an inevitable standout, and not just because it was his infamous post on a Kanye West Reddit thread that first brought the group together. Perhaps he’s impossible to look away from because he never stops moving, wrapped up in a world-on-his-shoulders kind of pensive frustration as he sprints or paces around the stage. His smiles never seemed quite comfortable, and occasionally his exaggerated facial expressions recalled Childish Gambino’s performance choices in his “This is America” music video.
In a rare — perhaps singular — moment of quiet, as the band wound down to their finale, Kevin stepped out on stage with nothing backing him but a bit of piano. Alone in the spotlight, he sang a verse off of “WEIGHT” from their newest album crooning, “and she was mad ‘cause I never wanna show her off / and every time she took her bra off my dick would get soft / I thought I had a problem, kept my head inside a pillow screaming.” Kevin was not quiet about his sexuality — “I’m more like Troye Sivan / with a whole lot of mela-nahn,” he rapped on “JESUS.” Surrounded by the 13-man family he created, he seemed bolstered in his decision to come out as gay in the often-homophobic rap world by the brothers who stood all around him. As he wanted it, BROCKHAMPTON is for everyone, and Kevin wouldn’t let stigma against homosexuality in the rap community keep him and his new family from going stratospheric.
It’s fitting that a band that’s managed to capture the millennial ethos like few others — indifference, ambiguity, variety, and vulnerability — formed around an innocuous Reddit post. There’s something so distinctly “young” amount them, a Billie Eilish kind of stylized nonchalance. But don’t let their gimmicky origin story deceive you — Brockhampton may be fresh-faced, but they’re here to stay. They’re not just some Soundcloud one-hit-wonder, but out for mainstream dominance. They like to call themselves “the best boyband since One Direction.” “Boyband” would seem a bit of an odd moniker for a group that’s more rap-heavy and hard-hitting that any of their preteen-favorite predecessors. But to BROCKHAMPTON, it’s all part of the brand. Amid all the weirdness and supposed indifference, there’s an inescapable competitive edge. They’re out to be the best, to “redefine the word ‘boy band,’” and to take on any limited definitions of masculinity the world tries to force on them.

Fresh off the release of his album “IGOR,” which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 Albums Chart, Tyler, the Creator headlined the first night of The Governors Ball with great charm and skill.
The rapper emerged to the sinister tones of “IGOR’S THEME,” the opening track of his new album. Bedecked in a brightly-colored suit and blonde bowl cut wig, of the type seen in the music video for new single “EARFQUAKE,” Tyler easily enthralled the audience, who joyfully sang along from the opening song. Tyler seemed genuinely moved that the new album, his first number one hit, had been so warmly received by the audience. He talked about not being sure that people would like the new album, which he described as being about heartbreak. This album, like its predecessor “Flower Boy,” marked a change from Tyler’s previous sound: a mellowing of harsher notes and a maturation of subject matter. Both Tyler’s new and older work were well received — he didn’t shy away from performing some early, more provocative and offensive tracks, as well as his newer, more vulnerable material.
Tyler began with his newest songs and worked backwards and then forwards again, his oldest material sandwiched in the middle. After beginning his set with an excellent run of tracks from “IGOR,” Tyler changed costumes, and re-emerged in a more casual look to perform some choice cuts from “Flower Boy.” Highlights from his most recent albums included the brooding “NEW MAGIC WAND” from “Igor” and “911 / Mr. Lonely” from “Flower Boy.” Tyler then performed a version of “BIKING,” a Frank Ocean track he’s featured on, and the heavy-hitting “OKRA,” which worked as a way to transition back to his harsher material.
Older tracks he performed included his attention-getting “Yonkers” from “Goblin,” the love-hate number “IFHY” from “Wolf,” and the love song from the perspective of a murderous stalker “She” from “Goblin.” Tyler confessed to, or claimed to forget lyrics from these older songs, and skipped delivering portions of them, which softened their effect. He said that he didn’t often perform these songs, and certainly performing rarely-delivered tracks the better part of a decade old is a feat. It was almost no matter: Audience members easily rapped along with the words he had forgotten.
After running through these older tracks, Tyler returned to his newer material, launching into the heavy-hitting “Who Dat Boy” from “Flower Boy.” He concluded with his pop-esque hits, “EARFQUAKE” from “IGOR” and “See You Again” from “Flower Boy.” These are beautiful tracks — loving, lovelorn, open, and big-hearted.
By slotting his older material in the middle of his set, Tyler effectively reframed some of the older pieces. His new work is marked by new openness about matters of the heart. Granted, Tyler has never shied away from talking about what’s on his mind, or his darker thoughts and emotions. But by rapping more about love, and being more open about who he loves (in terms of his sexual orientation), Tyler has created music that is newly and bravely open. Where his music has previously been marked by a proliferation of personae, his newer work seems finally, movingly, about himself. He concluded the set by talking about how he was worried that “IGOR” would be hated. His set and its reception proved that, far from being hated or hateful, this music is strong and loved.

Injury Reserve, a talented, up-and-coming Arizona hip-hop group, impressed on the first day of the 2019 Governors Ball Music Festival. The trio, rappers Stepa J. Groggs and Ritchie with a T and producer Parker Corey, performed tracks from their recent self-titled debut album, as well as from older projects. Highlights of the set included singles from their new album, the inventive “Jailbreak the Tesla,” an ode to hacking the electric vehicle, and the offbeat and imaginative “Koruna & Lime.” Throughout the set, Stepa and Ritchie mostly traded verses, alternating between more laidback delivery and high-energy, heavy-hitting spitting. The latter got the audience energized, at one point encouraging a veritable mosh pit. Injury Reserve concluded with “Oh Shit!!!” from their 2016 sophomore project, “Floss.” The track, which featured Stepa and Ritchie’s lively, high-spirited rapping over a looping melancholic piano sample — emblematic of Corey’s creative production — concluded the compelling set.
Another standout performer of the first day was Njomza, one of the opening acts of the festival, who performed a more intimate set at the fest’s Bud Light-sponsored, dive-themed stage. The singer and songwriter, who recently had a hand in Ariana Grande’s “7 Rings,” performed an array of dreamy, pop-R&B tracks. Highlights from the set included songs off of the artist’s 2018 EP “Vacation” like “Lonely Nights” and older material like “Sad For You” from her 2017 project of the same name. The standout song of the set was “Me & You” from “Vacation.” While in the recorded version she sings with an airy, dream-like quality, she performed the track in an earthier style, with a warm, full sound. From her singing to her establishment of an easy rapport with the audience through personable stage banter, Njomza performed with charm to spare.
Canadian singer-songwriter Jessie Reyez was another highlight from Friday afternoon. Reyez performed music released under her name, as well as a cover of “One Kiss,” the hit Dua Lipa and Calvin Harris single, that Reyez co-wrote. With her wonderfully expressive voice and a charismatic stage presence, Reyez put on an easy-to-love set. Particularly impressive were songs “Imported,” a charmingly blue pop ballad (“You’re in love with somebody else … Get over them by getting under me”), “Body Count,” featuring the unforgettable line, “I dodge dick on the daily” (accompanied by a visual featuring eggplant emojis to illustrate), and the deeply moving “Gatekeeper,” a song imagined from the perspective of a male music industry gatekeeper, based on her experience of being sexually harassed by a producer. In between songs, Reyez candidly discussed topics such as the importance of the #MeToo movement and her experiences with depression. She concluded her set with the moving “Figures,” a track that she described as having been written during a difficult time in her life. A soulful ballad about a bad breakup, it demonstrated Reyez’s vocal power, and illustrated a broader point about creating art in the midst of or as a response to pain. For these reasons, Reyez’s performance felt refreshingly real and honest.
Critically acclaimed artist Mitski performed an enthralling set of bruising and beautiful indie rock. With a full backing band rendering her crushing compositions, Mitski was free to focus on singing and choreography. The latter alternated between more abstract movement, which projected a cool, enigmatic charm and emotive, symbolic gestures, which were quite affecting. As evidenced by her expressive, highly stylized dancing, her performance was both open to and removed from the audience. She mostly forwent stage banter, focusing instead on conveying her ideas through poetic lyrics which, in the characteristic style of her set, seemed simultaneously confessional, invented, and aestheticized. She focused on tracks from her most recent three albums, including her widely acclaimed fifth album “Be the Cowboy,” as well as her breakthrough third and fourth albums, “Bury Me at Makeout Creek” and “Puberty 2.” Highlights from the set included “Townie,” a spiky, driving track about desire of the body and the heart, growing up or not, and horrible house parties. “Your Best American Girl,” about reckoning with cultural identity in the context of a relationship, featured a standout vocal performance. Finally, the set conclusion “Happy,” proved to be a characteristically “Mitski” take on the emotion. In “Happy,” the feeling is portrayed as a capricious lover, who comes and then leaves, with garbage to clean in his wake. As Mitski sang with a sort of abandon to a departing partner, “And when you go, take this heart / I'll make no more use of it when there's no more you,” she danced with wild joy. The wonderful complexity of this moment and this rich working of a seeming dichotomy emblematized what made her set so compelling to watch.

The New York based rock group Sunflower Bean showcased their punky verve and knack for good, old-Fashioned rock and roll in a strong Saturday set at the 2019 Governors Ball Music Festival. Frontwoman Julia Cumming, the band’s lead vocalist and bassist, demonstrated particularly strong stage presence from her varied vocals — ranging from decidedly husky to something sweeter to a lovely, growly shout — to her rollicking bass playing. The latter was perfectly complemented by lead guitarist Nick Kivlin’s equally rocking performance. The band as a whole — rounded out by Jacob Faber on the drums and Danny Ayala mostly on keys — had excellent chemistry and launched into extended jams and riffs with ease. The standout song of the set was the wonderfully unrestrained “Come For Me” from the band’s most recent EP, “King Of The Dudes.” Dad rock may be out of style, but the sharply dressed group (Cumming modeled for fashion house Yves Saint Laurent), made the old sound feel fresh.
Clairo’s charmingly un-showy set was another highlight from Saturday afternoon. The artist, who writes dreamy sounding, slightly drifty indie pop, played a mix of old tracks and new music from her upcoming debut album. The songs were decidedly unhurried and understated, but with a full backing band, they sounded fully realized and richly layered. Highlights from the set included “Drown,” a duet she released with Cuco, “Bags,” the lead single from her upcoming album, and the lightly existential disco track “4EVER.” With her first full length on the way, Clairo is one to watch.
King Princess, the queer pop sensation, performed a delightful Saturday afternoon set. Sporting carpenter pants, a glittering belly chain, and a cropped baseball jersey with “KP” in the style of the New York Yankees’ logo on the front and “King Princess 69” on the back, King Princess looked the part of the gay, genderqueer teen heartthrob that she is. The Brooklyn-born artist played a collection of hit singles, songs from her 2018 EP “Make My Bed,” and music from her upcoming debut album. Highlights from her set included unreleased material on which she showed off her guitar chops, the delightful “Pussy is God” (which features the bold declaration, for queer culture circa 2019: “I think star signs mean nothing”), and the wonderful downer-bop “Talia,” a song about drinking to deal with heartbreak that proved to be an unexpected banger and audience hit. Like Clairo, King Princess is decidedly one to watch. If this performance was any indication, her forthcoming debut album promises more sad, yet sublimely danceable pop.

Due to a whirlwind of weather-induced scheduling changes, only 11 of the planned 27 acts in Governors Ball’s Sunday lineup ended up being able to perform. Co-Headliners the Strokes and SZA were among the many anticipated acts forced to cancel on either the front or back ends of the concert.
One of the lucky artists to just make the cut was up and coming pop singer Chelsea Cutler, who hails from Westport, Connecticut. Opening things up at her rescheduled evening set, Chelsea walked on stage looking like a character out of Taylor Swift’s You Belong With Me music video. Wearing cut-out cowgirl pants and a soccer jersey — a nod to the college team she quit just last year to play music full time — she opened with her new single “You’re Not Missing Me.” The audience was on the smaller size, though not terrible for an artist who doesn’t even have a Wikipedia page yet. It was clear; however, that Chelsea has a particularly strong bond with these fans. They chanted her name even before she walked on stage, and she wandered to the front of the stage like she was trying to get as up-close and personal as possible. She cycled through a few more of her hits, a blend of EDM and off-brand pop, with a looping pedal to pull off longer instrumental sections. It’s not quite clear what her brand is, perhaps soccer player turned pop star girl next door? It’s unfortunate her singing voice is a bit slurred, because her lyrics — especially on tracks like “Your Shirt” and “Not OK” are often unexpectedly clever and thought-provoking. According to her twitter page, Chelsea’s got “soooooo much new music” in the near future; here’s hoping it’s just as earnest, and a little less bland.
Following Chelsea, old-school British pop queen Lily Allen set out to prove that, ten years and three kids later, she’s still got it. Allen’s Sunday afternoon performance seemed engineered as an extended answer to the question: What if her hit “Fuck You” was a 40 minute live set? From cynical satire like “Who’d Have Known” to the outright diss track “Not Fair,” Allen proved her fiery streak hasn’t gone anywhere. No stranger to talking to a crowd, the pop veteran drew laughs when she quipped about her uncomfortable shoes, her sweaty pink suit jacket, and Americans being wimps about rainy weather. A new song called “Party Line” — which Allen claimed will likely “never be released,” also ended up being an unexpected highlight. With a sing-song, reggae-style rhythm, it showed Allen letting her guard down and being a little more honest than unusual as she crooned the chorus “Every single time / I cross my line.” With her girlish smile, tongue-in-cheek hair clips, and penchant for wise-cracking, Allen proved she’s just as much fun as she’s always been. At the end of the set, she got a few extra cheers after yelling “Donald Trump no one wants your fucking opinion!” before pulling out a fitting closer — “Fuck You.”

The last of the night before an emergency weather evacuation, Nas’s performance was one of the day’s standouts. To an audience a bit older and more male than the fest’s average crowds, Nas ran through a victory lap of his biggest hits, to a surprising amount of fans who could sing every word. Nas didn’t waste any time complaining about his shortened set, but dove straight into a performance that was fast-paced and high-intensity from start to finish. He stole the show with an effortlessly self-assured showcase of classic lyrical rap. Highlights of the night were the instantly catchy “Got Ur Self a Gun,” the infectious confidence of “I Can,” and his signature swagger in “If I Ruled the World.” However, arguably the most memorable moment was near the end of the night, when he pulled out his ultimate diss track “Hate Me Now.” Right in the middle of the song, the weather went from a light drizzle to a near-downpour, and surprisingly enthusiastic audience members let loose, undid their hair to whip it around, and just generally went crazy. Sauntering off stage, Nas closed out his set with a classy “Governors ball, this was a fucking blast!”— and he was right.

Harvard College rescinded its offer of admission to Parkland, Fla. school shooting survivor and gun rights activist Kyle Kashuv earlier this month for racist comments he made in high school, according to an announcement he made on Twitter Monday.
Kashuv’s announcement included embedded emails he exchanged with administrators and a letter from Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 informing him of Harvard’s decision to rescind his place in the Class of 2023.
“As you know, the Committee takes seriously the qualities of maturity and moral character,” Fitzsimmons wrote in a letter dated June 3. “We are sorry about the circumstances that have led us to withdraw your admission.”
Kashuv, a recent graduate of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., became involved in gun rights advocacy in the wake of a mass shooting at the school that killed 17. He served as the high school outreach director for Turning Point USA, a nonprofit conservative advocacy group.
Earlier this year, Kashuv drew criticism from former classmates for a series of racist comments he made as a 16-year-old. Kashuv apologized on Twitter in May for his remarks, which included the repeated use of racial slurs in text messages and a Google Doc shared with classmates.
On May 24, Fitzsimmons sent Kashuv a letter reminding him of Harvard’s right to withdraw offers of admission and asked him to submit a written explanation about his conduct.
Kashuv responded with an explanation and an apology for his comments.
“Let me first state that I apologize unequivocally for my comments, which were made two years ago in private among equally immature high school students,” Kashuv wrote in his letter to the admissions office. “I said them, I regret them, and by explaining the context and my subsequent experiences I am not trying to excuse them.”
After Fitzsimmons informed Kashuv of the Admissions Committee’s decision to rescind his offer of admission, Kashuv responded asking to meet with him to discuss the matter. Fitzsimmons declined, writing that the committee’s decision was final.
Kashuv criticized the College’s decision on Monday, writing that he believes the admissions committee demonstrated that they do not recognize students’ ability to change their behavior. He added that he has not yet decided what he will do moving forward.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on the case, citing the College’s policies. She noted that Harvard makes accepted students aware of its right to withdraw admissions offers in a variety of circumstances, including “if an admitted student engages or has engaged in behavior that brings into question their honesty, maturity or moral character.”
Kashuv did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Other students who graduated alongside Kashuv have become prominent advocates for gun control, some visiting the Harvard Kennedy School last year calling for reform of gun laws. At least one of those students, David M. Hogg ’23, also earned admission to Harvard.
Kashuv’s case is not the first time Harvard’s decision to rescind admissions offers has become the focus of public debate. In 2017, the College rescinded offers of admission for at least 10 incoming freshmen who were involved in the exchange of racist and sexually explicit memes in a private Facebook group chat.

Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay will hire three to four senior faculty to specialize in Asian American, Latinx, and Muslim American studies during the upcoming academic year, the University announced Monday.
The hiring push could be the first step towards establishing a new concentration in ethnicity and migration, Gay told the Harvard Gazette, a University-run publication. Students and alumni staged a demonstration and sent multiple letters to University administrators earlier this year calling for an ethnic studies program at the University, marking the latest push in a decades-long effort.
Dean of Arts and Humanities Robin Kelsey and Dean of Social Science Lawrence D. Bobo are overseeing the hiring effort alongside Gay. The two deans are currently forming a faculty search committee, which will be led by Sociology Professor Mary C. Waters and by Mayra Rivera, the chair of FAS’s standing committee on Ethnicity, Migration, Rights.
Currently, the College offers an EMR secondary as well as an Ethnic Studies track within the History and Literature concentration. Activists, however, have called these insufficient, pointing to ethnic studies programs at peer institutions such as Yale.
Administrators previously have not outright rejected demands to create a formalized ethnic studies program but also have not committed to doing so. Gay’s comments Monday represent the furthest administrators have gone in recent years to acknowledge the possibility of creating such a program.
The University’s announcement Monday came after a year marked by student outcry over tenure decisions for faculty across the University whose scholarship includes work in ethnic studies.
In February, students and alumni protested the departure of two tenure-track faculty who specialize in Asian American studies, Associate Professor of Education Natasha K. Warikoo at the Graduate School of Education and Assistant Professor of History Genevieve A. Clutario in FAS. The University decided in November 2018 not to put Warikoo up for tenure, and Clutario accepted a tenured position at Wellesley College.
And in April, students and alumni of FAS and Harvard Divinity School circulated petitions decrying the Divinity School’s decision not to grant tenure to Ahmed Ragab. One letter specifically cited Ragab’s research in the field of Muslim studies, arguing that his work fills a “crucial gap” in scholarship on the topic at Harvard.
In an interview soon after taking office, Gay said she planned to concentrate on hiring faculty who focus on race and ethnicity before considering the establishment of a formal program. And in a March interview, Gay announced FAS has recruited three early-career scholars in Social Studies and Sociology who focus on ethnicity, migration, and indigeneity. The new recruits will join the faculty this fall.

A fire broke out Monday morning at OTTO Pizza in Harvard Square and was extinguished within an hour after an “aggressive attack,” the Cambridge Fire Department tweeted at approximately 8:30 a.m.
Gerard E. Mahoney — the acting chief of the department — wrote in an emailed statement that firefighters received a 911 call at 7:32 a.m. to respond to a fire in the restaurant’s pizza hood. The fire caused no injuries, Mahoney said.
The department deployed a 33-person response team consisting of four engine companies, three ladder companies, one rescue company, two paramedic squad companies, and two division chiefs to respond to the fire, according to Mahoney.
The Cambridge Police Department also diverted traffic to go in one direction on Massachusetts Ave Monday morning outside the 1432 Massachusetts Avenue restaurant, the police department tweeted at approximately 7:50 a.m.
Mahoney said firefighters discovered the fire in the ductwork of OTTO’s exhaust system after encountering a “smoke condition” in C’est Bon Market and Liquors — a shop located next to OTTO.
An investigation unit from the Cambridge Fire Department is examining the cause of the fire and the Cambridge Inspectional Services Department was requested to the scene, according to Mahoney.
“The Inspectional Services Department was requested to the scene because of the nature of the fire and because this is a food establishment,” he said.
OTTO spokesperson Eric Shepherd wrote in an emailed statement that the Cambridge restaurant was undergoing “routine maintenance” on its exhaust system Monday morning when workers saw smoke.
“Sub-contractors doing the work noticed smoke while they were working and reported the fire immediately to the authorities,” Shepherd said.
OTTO, which suffered “water-related” damage, closed for the day as a result of the fire, according to Shepherd. He added it is “unclear at this point” when the restaurant will reopen.
“We are in the process of analyzing the extent of the damage,” Shepherd said. “We plan on updating our customers and the community when we have a timeline.”
George Sarkis — the manager and owner of C’est Bon — said Tuesday that smoke had come into the store Monday morning, which triggered one of the sprinkler systems. C’est Bon closed Monday and will likely remain closed for the next few days, according to Sarkis.
“There was water in store. We dried it out last night,” Sarkis said. “Now we’re just trying to put the pieces back together and get back and reopen as soon as possible.”
