After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Over 230 years ago, a young woman named Deborah Samson fled her role as an indentured servant in Massachusetts, disguised herself as a man, and enlisted in the Continental Army under the name of Robert Shurtliff. She served for a year and a half of the Revolutionary War before she was wounded and honorably discharged. About two centuries later, her descendent Alex S. Myers ’00 came out as a transgendered man and was the first openly transgender person to attend Harvard. Inspired by Samson's story, Myers penned a historical novel about her life called “Revolutionary,” which has just been released; he will be reading from the novel at the Harvard Book Store today. Informed by his own personal experiences, Myers uses the story of Samson’s journey and self-discovery to grapple with the complexities surrounding gender and identity.
 In Revolutionary, Myers uses a few basic facts about Samson’s life, such as her enlistment in the army and some of her letters, and employs his imagination to fill in the gaps in her story. Myers says he found the task of recreating the mind of his ancestor to be an intriguing and challenging process. “I wanted to keep the point of view accurate while representing the psychology,” he says. “I had to ask myself, ‘What would she have wanted? What would she have felt was respectable and reasonable? What would she have found normal?’” 
 As the novel progresses, Samson’s identity becomes increasingly blurred and the gender barrier starts to break down to the point that she says at the novel’s conclusion: “I am Robert Shurtliff…but I am also Deborah Samson.” Indeed, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of who is speaking or thinking—Myers shifts between masculine and feminine pronouns in a single scene, and uses the names Robert and Deborah interchangeably, until it is unclear whether the novel’s protagonist is a hero or a heroine. 
 Samson’s journey mirrors Myers’ own beliefs that labeling gender and sexual identities is not a black and white process. “Deborah outperformed many of her male peers and got honors on the battlefield,” Myers says. “Our understanding of gender is completely constructed. If you treat a woman like a delicate flower, that’s how she will be. If you let people live to their full capacities, they can totally outdo [their] potentials.”
 Samson’s path to become a man is, however, radically different from Myers’s own story. According to him,  “Deborah more than anything wanted to be free, and it was only by becoming a man that she was able to achieve the liberty she desired.” Myers doubts that, if she lived today, Deborah would be transgender. “She would be able to do what she wanted today and wouldn’t have to be a man to do it. Maybe she would be transgender or queer, but largely she would just want more freedom.” Myers, on the other hand, has always wanted to be a boy. In 1995, in his final year at Philips Exeter Academy, he became the first openly transgender student in the school’s history and changed his name from Alice to Alex. At Harvard, Myers chose to identify as transgender instead of simply male and became an outspoken advocate. “As the only out trans person [at Harvard], people were understandably ignorant in the beginning,” he says. Overall, however, he found Harvard to be a very supportive place where his fellow peers were eager to learn about his identity and transgender rights. 
 His story differs from Samson’s, but Myers did draw on his own experiences while writing “Revolutionary.” Myers says he can relate to Samson’s feelings of frustration with her gender role on a smaller scale. “When I was younger, I had an older brother, and I always felt it was so unfair that he could do things that I couldn’t just because I was a girl,” he says. “I had to wear a dress while he got to wear pants.” 
 Myers describes modern America’s struggles with gender as minor compared to Samson’s, but he does feel that there is work to be done in breaking down the restrictions that women still face on a daily basis, particularly in the military. He hopes that “Revolutionary” inspires readers to continue to think about the complexity of gender to consider its ambiguity as well as the discrimination that many modern women face. In “Revolutionary,” Samson strikes down the barriers that face her with breeches and bullets; today, Myers is doing the same with his words.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Senior forward Kyle Casey may not have led the Harvard men’s basketball team on paper, but for one minute in the second half he owned Lavietes Pavilion.
With 11 minutes to play against Ancient Eight rival Princeton (12-4, 0-2 Ivy), junior forward Wesley Saunders was held up at the top of the key. He leapt into the air and fed a pass over the defense to an open Casey under the basket. Casey slammed the ball home, igniting the biggest home crowd that the Crimson (16-3, 3-0) has drawn all season.
On the other end, Casey came down with the defensive rebound—one of his five boards on the night—and fed co-captain Laurent Rivard in front of the Harvard bench. Rivard sunk his fifth three of the game, but Casey wasn’t done.
On Harvard’s next possession, Casey delivered his second straight dunk in traffic. Though Casey would foul out with six seconds remaining in the contest, one minute of work was all it took for the senior to help his squad open up a 15-point lead—Harvard’s biggest advantage of the night. With the Crimson frontcourt depleted as a result of injuries, Casey’s physicality proved crucial down the stretch as Harvard fought to overcome a sudden dry spell from the free-throw line that reenergized the Tigers.
“Kyle gives us a dimension that is invaluable to our team, with his athleticism,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “Kyle’s going to do some really good things for us and we need him to be out on the floor and not be in foul trouble.”
DOWN AND OUT
Though Harvard regained Casey and co-captain Brandyn Curry since the last time it took on the Tigers in 2012-2013, an unexpected missing piece shook up the Crimson’s game plan coming into the weekend.
Junior center Kenyatta Smith—who broke out against Princeton at home last year and was a key factor in the team’s title run—did not suit up for Friday’s contest. Smith had played his first minutes of the season against Dartmouth last weekend after being sidelined with a foot injury that occurred before the start of nonconference play. Though the center was expected to make his return this weekend, a re-injury at Monday’s practice put Smith out for the remainder of the season.
“[It’s v]ery disappointing for him, first of all, and then very disappointing for our team, knowing that he was going to be an integral part of the season—of whatever success we were going to have—and now we don’t have him,” Amaker said. “It was a very tough game for us to figure out, with not having a full compliment of players that we have had here recently.”
Also unexpectedly absent from the lineup were junior forward Jonah Travis—out indefinitely with a concussion—and sophomore wing Agunwa Okolie—a versatile shooter who has had knee trouble of late. Without Travis or Okolie to step in, the style of play exhibited by Amaker’s squad was reminiscent of the 2012-2013 team’s brand of small-ball, with Rivard clocking in close to 40 minutes alongside Saunders and sophomore point guard Siyani Chambers.
“Coach Amaker always says, ‘Play ready so you don’t have to get ready,’” Rivard said. “Whether we have these guys or not, we just stay true to our identity…. We have to play some more minutes but a lot of us are used to it, especially from last year.”
ALONE AT THE TOP
After a wild night around the league, Harvard emerged as the sole undefeated team in the Ancient Eight, moving into first place in conference standings. Princeton—who finished second last year in the Ivy League—has now dropped back-to-back Ancient Eight contests, and is winless in the conference thus far. Penn suffered its first loss at Dartmouth on Friday night, and Columbia and Brown fell, as well.
Though early in the season, Friday night was a statement win for the Crimson, which will need to win the Ivy League outright in order to guarantee a third consecutive NCAA tournament bid. Harvard forfeited any chance it may have had at an at-large bid with its losses against Colorado and Connecticut, as well as a more surprising upset at Florida Atlantic to close out its nonconference season.
Though the Crimson has separated itself for now, its position is anything but comfortable. This weekend marks the start of back-to-back conference play for Harvard, in which the team plays two games in as many days for the next six weeks. Unique to the Ivy League, the schedule—often referred to as the “14-game tournament”—makes for volatile conference standings. For now, the Crimson has positioned itself well by avoiding an early loss in what was expected to be its toughest league matchup of the season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The hosts found themselves in an unfamiliar position Friday night at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center: hanging on for dear life. They’ll take it over trying to crawl back from the dead.
Three goals in the first 10 minutes were just enough for the Harvard men’s hockey team (6-11-3, 3-9-3 ECAC) to snap a four-game losing streak and sweep its season series with Princeton (4-16-0, 3-10-0). Despite two extra-man goals from Tiger senior defenseman Alex Rush in the final seven minutes, the Crimson escaped the ice with a 3-2 win.
“I think we’ve found, and proven to ourselves, that it’s a lot easier to hold on than it is to try to come back,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said.
Weighed down by first period deficits in its last home stand against Cornell and Colgate, the Crimson got the quick start it had been waiting for all season with goals from sophomore Greg Gozzo, freshman center Alexander Kerfoot, and sophomore forward Jimmy Vesey in the opening minutes. Senior goaltender Raphael Girard was perfect for 53 minutes before surrendering goals on 5-on-3 and 6-on-5 Princeton advantages.
“We’ve been harping on having a good start for the past couple of weeks,” Vesey said. “It seemed like for awhile we were going down two [or] three goals every game, and it’s tough to come back from that kind of deficit.”
Harvard entered Friday’s game looking for its first ECAC win since beating Princeton, 5-3, at Hobey Baker Rink on Nov. 16. After challenging No. 3 Union in a close 4-3 loss last Saturday, the Crimson took the chance to jump on an unranked opponent who has also struggled to collect conference points this year.
Harvard came out with an aggressive forecheck, and Gozzo got the team rolling with a strike two minutes into the first period. The sophomore led an initial rush up the left wing before beating Princeton freshman goaltender Colton Phinney left-side off a rebound from freshman linemate Tyler Moy.
Kerfoot also found success on Phinney’s left moments later. The freshman skated around the Princeton goaltender and scored glove-side at 4:24 after a behind-the-net feed from sophomore forward Kyle Criscuolo.
Vesey redirected a crossing pass from sophomore defenseman Desmond Bergin at 9:40 to give the Crimson its largest first period lead of the season. Working from the right point, Bergin found Vesey streaking down the left side of the slot for the forward’s team-leading 11th goal of the season.
“[Bergin] faked the shot, [and] then hit me backdoors,” Vesey said. “It was a really great pass from Desmond.”
Princeton received new life with eight minutes left in regulation after junior defenseman Max Everson and freshman forward Sean Malone were whistled for minor penalties 13 seconds apart. Rush found the back of the net from the left point on the ensuing 5-on-3 at 13:20. After Princeton pulled Phinney for the extra attacker three minutes later, Rush scored again through traffic from the right point with just over three minutes left in regulation.
Phinney, who finished the game with 30 saves, turned away a number of Harvard opportunities for a fourth goal, including a breakaway from sophomore forward Kyle Criscuolo with just over two minutes to play. The Crimson did not have to stave off another 6-on-5 Princeton attack after Tigers junior forward Tucker Brockett was whistled for tripping.
In the second period, Princeton turned up the pressure on Girard, who was starting in his first game since receiving an early hook from Donato during the Crimson’s 5-1 loss to Yale in the Rivalry On Ice game at Madison Square Garden. On Friday, the senior goaltender turned away good chances from senior forwards Andrew Ammon and Andrew Calof before senior defenseman Jeremy Goodwin rang a shot off the outside of Harvard’s right post late in the frame. The Crimson entered the second intermission with its three-goal lead intact, and Girard finished the night with 26 saves.
In Harvard’s last tune-up before the Beanpot, the win provided some breathing room near the bottom of the ECAC standings. The Tigers currently sit three points behind the 10th-place Crimson, who will face Northeastern on Monday. Donato said that Harvard will have to be less complacent at TD Garden for the program to advance to its first Beanpot championship game since 2008.
“We had chances to bury [the game tonight]. We weren’t trying to get the fourth and the fifth goal,” Donato said. “Hopefully, we learn a little bit of [a] lesson that the game can turn in a hurry and that we really…need to keep the foot on the gas pedal.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first time that the Harvard and Princeton women’s ice hockey teams met this season, the Crimson dealt the Tigers a 4-0 defeat, handily pitching its first shutout of the year.
Friday night’s rematch at Hobey Baker Rink was a much different story.
This time, Princeton (10-9-3, 6-7-1 ECAC) went toe-to-toe with No. 3/5 Harvard (17-2-2, 13-2-1), but a late power-play goal from sophomore forward Mary Parker propelled the Crimson to a 3-2 victory.
“At this point in the season, everybody is eager to get conference points,” Harvard coach Maura Crowell said. “We’re trying to hang on to first place, and they’re trying to climb up the playoff ladder. They were chomping [at the] bit ready to go, and we were too, so it was an evenly matched game and a hard fought 60 minutes.”
After a hooking call against the Tigers put the Crimson on the man-advantage midway through the third period, Harvard capitalized. In the latter stages of the power play, junior defenseman Sarah Edney fired a shot on net, which was pushed aside by Princeton goaltender Kimberly Newell. Parker quickly seized the rebound and beat Newell for what proved to be the game-winner with 6:35 remaining in the contest.
Crowell had one word to describe the performance of the junior: “clutch.”
“[Mary’s] got a nose for the net,” Crowell said. “If there are loose pucks in the slot, she’s definitely one that can put them away.”
The Tigers had evened the score early in the final frame on a power-play goal of their own from junior forward Brianna Leahy. Crimson goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer made a save on the initial shot from defenseman Rose Alleva but could not corral the rebound, allowing the forward to connect for the equalizer.
But once Harvard regained the lead late in the third, Princeton could not find a way to level the score once again. The Crimson defense held the Tigers to two shots following Parker’s go-ahead goal, and Maschmeyer, who recorded 22 saves on the night, stopped both.
“Going down and playing at Princeton is always difficult,” Parker said. “Princeton always is a tough team to play against. They always come out ready to go, working really hard.”
The victory extends Harvard’s winning streak to five games. It also marks the fourth time this season that the Crimson has come from behind to win a contest. Nonetheless, it was the team’s first such effort in quite a while.
Not having trailed for over 200 consecutive minutes, Harvard finally fell behind for the first time in two weeks in the opening minute of the second period. After having her first shot stopped by Maschmeyer, Tiger forward Jaimie McDonell poked the puck past the Crimson goaltender in the middle of a crowded crease to put Princeton on top.
However, it did not take long for Harvard to offer a response. The Crimson carried the puck into the Tiger zone after winning the ensuing faceoff, and Parker found freshman forward Sydney Daniels whose one-timer beat Newell just 15 seconds after Princeton had earned its first lead.
“We came right back at them, and that was huge,” Crowell said. “[There was] a big momentum shift once we scored that goal. We’ve done that several times this season, so I just think it speaks to the resiliency of the group and their confidence in each other.”
Momentum certainly did swing in Harvard’s favor following Daniels’ seventh tally of the season, as the Crimson struck again less than three minutes later.
Coming from the blue line, Edney carried the puck behind the goal where she saw junior forward Samantha Reber crash to the net. Edney fired a pass toward the darting forward, who lit the lamp for the second time against the Tigers this season.
With two goals on four shots in the opening 3:21 of the second frame, Harvard had already surpassed its first-period shot total of three.
“We started out a little slow…but then we started getting back to the basics and what we do best—playing fast and just playing as a team,” Parker said. “Then we started clicking and putting some pucks to the net.”
With Friday’s win, the Crimson maintains its three-point advantage over Clarkson atop the ECAC.
“In order to continue our success, we want to just stick with the simple things,” Parker said. “[That means] off the ice getting enough rest and being healthy, and then being ready to go every time we’re on the ice and just working hard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a tense six-point victory against rival Princeton on Friday, there was little drama in the Harvard men’s basketball team’s 80-50 victory over Penn (4-13, 1-2 Ivy) on Saturday night. Harvard (17-3, 4-0) was down by one after ten minutes of play but up by 21 at halftime. The margin never dropped below 20 the rest of the way, growing to 32 late in the second half. The 30-point victory was the largest win over Penn in Harvard history.
“The big sell here was to come and do things that haven’t been done [in Harvard history],” senior forward Kyle Casey said. “It’s hard to think of things that haven’t been done before at Harvard.”
For the second straight night, co-captain Laurent Rivard registered a season high, leading all scorers with 22 points. The senior, whose green light to shoot is brighter than any Nick Carraway ever saw, at one point hit three straight threes in a 56-second span.
“He had a hell of a night,” Casey said. “They kept losing him and we kept finding him.… On any given night, anyone [on this team] can explode. It was definitely his night.”
As a group, the three seniors in the rotation—Rivard, fellow co-captain Brandyn Curry, and Casey—had 46 points and shot 11-of-14 from behind the arc. The Crimson did not score a two-point basket for the first 16 minutes of the second half, earning its first 30 points of the period on threes or free throws. The team made 12 treys and 26 free throws on the night—both season highs.
“Being seniors, sometimes I don’t give those guys enough [credit] because you expect certain things out of them,” Amaker said. “I am very pleased with their production and how they are leading our team.”
On the defensive end, the Crimson held the Quakers to their lowest scoring output of the season. Penn shot just 41 percent from the field, missing its final six three-pointers after senior Miles Cartwright made one with 18:49 left in the first half.
“We have preached and talked about [defense] since day one,” Amaker said. “This has not been one year, two years in the making. It has been seven years that it has been the staple of our program. We think it is the best way to build teamwork and camaraderie…all the components that you need to build a first-rate program."
For the first nine minutes of the game, Harvard was unable to summon the intensity of the previous evening. The Quakers made six of its first 11 shots from the floor en route to an 18-15 lead, looking more like the team that took down Princeton at home than the one which lost to 7-14 George Mason.
Then one side of the scoreboard stopped working.
A Saunders reverse layup in the lane was the first of 11 consecutive Harvard points. The 11-0 run quickly became a 19-2 run, and by halftime the Crimson had scored 29 of the final 34 points. Rivard, who hit two threes and was fouled on another, scored nine points in the spurt.
Harvard clamped down on the defensive end during the run, forcing turnovers on three of five possessions after Saunders’ jumper. The Quakers made just four of their final 16 field goals of the period, missing all three three-pointers attempted.
Penn coach Jerome Allen’s game plan was evident early. The Quakers began the game by feeding the ball relentlessly to sophomore center Darien Nelson-Henry. With Harvard’s frontcourt weakened by the injuries to juniors Kenyatta Smith (foot) and Jonah Travis (concussion), Nelson-Henry made four early field goals before picking up his second foul.
“He’s a big boy,” Casey said. “He got us a few times on the angle post-up and when he rides you up the lane, it is hard to help [and] hard to guard.”
Without Smith, who guarded Nelson-Henry when the teams played last year, Amaker turned to freshman Zena Edosomwan. Edosomwan, who had 11 points and a career-high nine rebounds a week ago against Florida Atlantic, had 10 points in his 12 minutes on the floor.
“You can see him growing,” Amaker said. “We have seen flashes, a little bit here and there. He has been practicing well and it is nice to see that translate into minutes and production for him on the court. Now he can go back and recognize the work is paying off.”
