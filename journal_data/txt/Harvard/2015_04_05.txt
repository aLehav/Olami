Remember earlier this year when Humans of New York's (HONY) photo of a boy from Mott Hall Bridges Academy talking about his principal turned into a kickstarter to raise money towards the school's visit to Harvard? Well around 200 students and members of MBHA and Brandon Stanton, the creator of HONY, made the visit to Cambridge this past Thursday!
Project TEACH, an early college-awareness program at Harvard, and Harvard College Admissions and Financial Aid worked in conjunction to provide students with a sense of what college life was like. They participated in hands-on activities at various places throughout campus, such as the American Repertory Theater to the Harvard Museum of Natural History. President Faust, Dean Khurana, and Dean Fitzsimmons spoke before the students as well.
As for Stanton's kickstarter, it actually ended up making close to $1.5 million, though the original goal was $100,00! With the extra funds, the school plans to start a scholarship fund for graduates of MBHA. Talk about inspiration!

What food comes to mind when you think of Rice Krispies, Fruit Roll-Ups, and Swedish fish? Probably not sushi, unless you're Lynette G. Bye '16. Known amongst her friends as an April Fool's aficionado, she decided to make sushi out of candy for her friends after some online searching.
Are you motivated to step up your April Fool's Day game for next year now? We certainly are.
