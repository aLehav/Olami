After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The recent and highly publicized series of alleged suicides among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender students has attracted media attention to a previously underpublicized problem facing many American teenagers: bullying on the basis of sexual orientation. As if middle school and high school were not challenging enough, the extra burden placed upon some individuals of coming to terms with their sexuality in an unfriendly and intolerant environment can be too much to face. These recent tragedies emphasize the importance of creating safe educational institutions for students of all races, socioeconomic statuses, and sexual orientations. In particular, we strongly encourage colleges, high schools, and middle schools to provide adequate resources for LGBT students, as they need welcoming communities to help stave off latent and overt bullying that makes them especially susceptible to harmful behavior and suicide.
Indeed, LGBT teens represent a particularly at-risk community among all students. A national “school climate survey” of middle and high schools in 2009 found that almost nine out of 10 LGBT teens experienced harassment at their school, and the majority reported feeling “unsafe” because of their sexual orientations. Furthermore, queer teens’ suicide rates are almost four times those of their straight classmates—a shocking an unacceptable statistic.
All people should have the right to feel safe in their schools. More money must be allocated to establish better institutionalized LGBT resources—such as LGBT coordinators or counselors—in middle and high schools. In addition, as issues of sexual orientation and gender identity often arise at an early age, it is imperative that middle school guidance counselors and teachers receive special training for dealing with these issues when they begin. As several of these recent suicides have been the result of bullying based upon the mere perception of homosexuality, it is crucial to teach tolerance, particularly of LGBT identities, to students at a very early age. Finally, it is imperative to educate children about cyberbullying and internet privacy, particularly as members of the current school-age generation seem to feel entitled to act differently and with fewer qualms when they are behind the protection of a computer screen than in real life.
Yet reforms must extend beyond the classroom. Although it is crucial for students to learn to appreciate diversity, teachers cannot prevent all the damage done to LGBT students who live in a nation filled with politicians and religious leaders who constantly employ vitriolic language when discussing homosexuality. Indeed, these public figures’ hateful rhetoric can influence children from an early age. Moreover, as of June 2010, only 17 states have laws that address discrimination or harassment based on sexual orientation in schools. There is, accordingly, much room for legal reforms.
Providing a safe space for all students is of the utmost importance for policy makers, educators, and school officials. As the tragic incidents of the past few weeks demonstrate, there is certainly room for improvement in schools across the country. On a local level, we hope that Harvard and its students will strive to continue to provide an open and safe space for all students while more widespread reform and teaching occurs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twelve years ago, the Ibrahim family made a trip up to a beautiful town in northern Pakistan. It was the peak of winter, there was snow everywhere, and they were staying in a small and very poorly heated inn reminiscent of Wuthering Heights. Appropriately enough, the enterprising innkeepers had named it “Walnut Heights.” The nights were bitingly cold, so they had to save buckets of hot water and pile on the blankets before they slept. The early mornings were blindingly white, and someone had made a little snow Buddha just outside the window with twigs for hair. They recalled the beautiful bare trees and trout fishing in the treacherous Indus River, just a few miles away. They left that place knowing that someday they would return. That town was located in Swat Valley.
Ten years later, the same valley was overrun by the Taliban.  And barely two years after they were driven out, the Indus continued the cycle of destruction against the people of that valley that the Taliban began. What the Taliban left behind, the floods have taken away. There are many similar, tragic stories being played out all across Pakistan. Many of us South Asians here at Harvard have felt the pinch as we read the news and wonder what we can do about it from here. It is indeed a tragedy that the world media has gradually shifted attention from the flood crisis toward other controversies. For every Islamophobic statement made, one more family is forced to drink unsafe water. For every argument made back and forth about the mosque at Ground Zero, one more disease is reported among the refugees who are waiting for the world to decide what should be done. Even with celebrities like Angelina Jolie coming to Pakistan and speaking out in support of the flood victims, the issue still requires more attention from prestigious institutions like Harvard.
While politicians have already turned the other cheek to what is happening, perhaps we can rectify these crimes with the resources we possess, an institution that has fostered idealism within us from our first day of freshman year.
Here at Harvard, a number of initiatives are making headway. Spiced, the annual intercollegiate charity dance hosted by the South Asian Association this weekend at The Estate club in Boston, is donating part of its proceeds to the International Rescue Committee, an organization working in Pakistan since the influx of Afghan refugees in the 1980s. The Woodbridge Society for International Students is planning a panel discussion in October followed by a raffle for prizes, the proceeds will be donated towards flood relief. In addition to this a cultural event focusing on Pakistan is in the works. The Harvard Humanitarian Initiative is launching a webpage with information and links on how to donate as well as current statistics on the situation. Meanwhile, Harvard Pakistan Student Group comprising of concerned graduate and undergraduate students is working with various organizations to launch a long-term awareness campaign that aims primarily to foster an interest in this affected region while raising funds on a smaller scale. The response from students and awareness on their part is needed most for an issue of this magnitude as apathy and media boredom with the issue have hindered humanitarian efforts thus far.
At the moment, with a looming threat of epidemics in refugee camps, immediate relief is crucial. Ten million people are in need of meals immediately, but in the long run, the need to rebuild hospitals, provide medicines, and rebuild homes and schools is a more daunting challenge.
Harvard alums are currently working in areas that have been ignored by the world media. Samad Khurram ’10 was recently in Baluchistan with Khushaal Pakistan, a social work organization he founded. Baluchistan province is the center of a separatist movement and has traditionally been the poorest in Pakistan. Along with a group of volunteers, Samad distributed medical supplies and food rations and identified far-flung affected areas that were unlikely to be visited again by major relief organizations. In an interview he told us how he came to realize the grave consequences if timely relief and reconstruction are not carried out.  According to him, “Rightwing Islamist groups are filling the vacuum of immediate relief, and this will have political consequences in years to come”. Another fear that he expressed to us was how “rebuilding educational institutions will be neglected in the wake of this disaster and this will have long-term social implications for a country already battling extremism, poverty, and lack of resources.” Yet his accounts were also inspiring. One member of the National Assembly of Pakistan with whom he stayed for a few days was living in the Baluch camps belonging to his constituency and was working tirelessly to meet the needs of all the people, despite the shortage of supplies. Day in and day out, he would be swarmed by women with concerns over a child’s ill health, shortage of medicines, shortage of water and the list went on. Yet his presence and resolve has in Samad’s words “prevented chaos in the camp” and it is these kinds of individuals who are really keeping the people afloat.
Swat is now just a memory, kept afloat by a vision. The place where some of us grew up or visited, where we planned to bring our children, is now nothing more than a remnant of the past that you see only with closed eyes. These days, moments, and places are lost—but their sights are retained in the minds of those who live on to educate others of their subtle beauties. We serve a mission here at Harvard to bring our knowledge and our past with us to share with others. The new crisis in Pakistan acts as a reminder for us to preserve and mend, to pick up the pieces of a memory and put them back together again.

The news headlines that every fan wants to go away just keep coming. Last week, three-time Tour de France champion Alberto Contador was reported as having failed a second drug test that was taken during last summer’s Tour de France. As disappointing as it is for this news to come out, it is far from surprising. Cycling as a sport is used to dealing with these issues. Almost every one of its stars, including Lance Armstrong, has come under allegations of doping—the practice of having a blood transfusion done to increase your body’s level of red blood cells, which can increase aerobic capacity and endurance. Doping is in part so pervasive because, along with its efficacy, autologous transfusions (transfusions of your own previously withdrawn blood) make detection extremely challenging. The technology aimed at catching these violators is improving—Contador himself was caught by a new test—but so too is the market for evading each method. And the steroids crisis is not confined to cycling. Over the last decade the list of users of banned and illegal substances has been robust and notable, from would-be hall of famers to former gold medal winners, like Alex Rodriguez, and Marion Jones.
Performance-enhancing drug usage among top players irks us because a doping player skews both present competition and the history of that game. When Barry Bonds broke Hank Aaron’s lifetime home-run record, most fans demanded an asterisk be put next to his name in the record books, so as not to allow an alleged cheater have such an honor. Therefore, the consequence of positive tests should not just modify a feat, like in Bonds’’ case; rather, doping should erase any accomplishments that were attached to the violation. In a similar way that Reggie Bush gave back his Heisman Trophy in the aftermath of allegations about recruitment practices at the University of Southern California, athletes guilty of use of anabolic steroids and other banned substances should have any records, statistics, or honors removed that occurred during the season of the positive test.
It is fair to say that taking a trophy back does not accomplish any real change, but the public awareness of these historical corrections will disincentivize using these drugs. Erasure should not only include any awards from that season of competition but also the salary or prize-money in the case of a championship should also be returned. The strictest part of this type of protocol, which could easily be specifically adapted to the majority of professional sports leagues, is that entrance to any sort of Hall of Fame, honor roll, or all-star team should be forbidden. While players who have doped should still be allowed to compete in the future, (banning them for life allows no chance to make amends for their mistakes), they should not be able to use their past, tainted records to achieve any sort of distinction.
This reaction will likely not end steroid use in baseball or doping in cycling, but removal of accolades and compensation and barring from each sport’s honor system will send the message that their substance-tainted performances counted for nothing. Most professional athletes exhibit the strong desire to be remembered and to have their numbers and skills revered. Losing that opportunity entirely eliminates of the motivation for enhanced performance. With the prospect of prohibition from being remembered for skill and accomplishments, more drugs will be left at the counter and trophies rightly in their cases.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My predilection for irony began innocently enough, with the occasional air quote and misanthropic remark. This occurred around the same time that Britney began conspicuously consuming Cheetos and Christina transitioned from blonde to black. My childhood icons flabby and fallen, general snark progressed to full-blown cynicism. Ironic comments evolved from a sporadic indulgence to a conversational a priori, while imagined acts of ironic consumption—monogrammed sweatpants, Lunchables, fresh-frozen anything—offered daily diversions. I lost the ability to communicate with the overly-literal. I cringed when others failed to grasp the incongruity of their actions. Eventually, even my choice of emoticons inclined toward the ironic, the wink always seeming more apt than either smile or frown.  
After attempting to ironically watch “Jersey Shore,” I knew that I had hit bottom. The “so bad, it’s good” mantra could only excuse so much. This was the apogee of cultural awfulness—a show so brazenly self-parodying that it begged to taken in jest. Yet, unlike Samuel Jackson’s clenched stare in “Snakes on a Plane,” this concentrated camp was decidedly not fun. Fist-pumps, spray-tans, hair-poufs: The fruit was absurdly low-hanging. The joke was too obvious to admit irony; condescension, too easy to be worthwhile.
This realization—that ironic detachment could not compensate for the stalest of kitsch—proved problematic. Irony was fun, but it hardly served a higher purpose. Did I really want to pass my days studying Guidos in hopes of the chance to ironize later? Routinely taking a hatchet to a fly felt like overkill; what’s more, it smacked of elitism. Weren’t there more productive things to do than hate on the Snooki-ilk? If so, could I quit irony wholesale? Or would recession-induced cynicism only tighten irony’s hold on my worldview?
A post-ironic self, writer Michael Hirschorn surmised, can come in one of two varieties. One can submit to the lowbrow without recourse to cynical commentary. If executed properly, a fully sincere individual will emerge—one who derives nonironic pleasure from staid cultural clichés like strip malls and Baconators. Alternatively, one can force his or her irony underground. This entails going through the motions without appending ironic justifications: making air quotes in earnest, for example, or speaking pseudo-Italian at Starbucks sans snark. The first rang of corporate brainwashing; the second reeked of “ignorance is bliss” naiveté. A post-ironic self may have been palatable in the abstract, but its reality was far less so.
The irony wars began raging in the early 90s, when the market was up and malaise was in. Expert ironist David Foster Wallace likened irony to tyranny: the root cause of what he saw as pervasive cultural despair and stagnancy. Harvard alumnus Jedidiah S. Purdy ’97 continued the onslaught with his topical monograph, “For Common Things.” Branding political apathy, civic disengagement, and general dejection as part-and-parcel of the ironic posture, Purdy aimed his polemic at those whom he deemed hardest hit: young, Ivy League types made smug and soft by easy A’s and on-campus recruiting. Pro-irony forces fired back, lambasting Purdy as a sanctimonious simpleton who had confused irony with, well, something else. Defending irony non-ironically, however, proved a thorny endeavor. The media soon tired of its new buzzword, and the once heated back-and-forth ended at an impasse.
Three years into the Great Recession, Americans have ample reason to be ironic. Yet, even with Congressional approval ratings skirting 25 percent, this rhetorical-strategy-cum-cultural-scapegoat hardly makes the news. This, I believe, is too bad. Lest we forget, irony is an invaluable strategy of subversion: a subtle, intelligent way to criticize the conformist and the asinine. Far from apolitical, irony offers a potent mode of political intervention. As film critic Jeffrey Sconce noted, irony is not the refusal to believe in anything, but the refusal to buy into “something else’s something”—whether the latter be Dicky Cheney or Double-Quarter-Pounders. The ultimate inside gag, it provides way to laugh at the Man without him being in on the joke.
In the end, my ironic inclinations proved no cause for identity crisis. As my short-lived attempt at abstinence revealed, living un-ironically is distinctly un-fun. A world without irony, it seems, would be the true cause for despair.

The Nathan I. Huggins Lecture Series concluded yesterday with a talk by Harold Holzer, the senior vice president for external affairs at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, on the iconography of Abraham Lincoln after the Emancipation Proclamation.
According to Holzer, there has been an evolution in artistic representations of the Emancipation Proclamation since 1863, when the Proclamation was issued. Holzer noted, for example, that in early representations, calligraphers would darken certain words of the Proclamation to make an image of Lincoln out of the text,
Holzer suggested that this early emphasis on printing the text of the Proclamation stemmed from the difficulty of dealing with emancipation during the Civil War.
“Representations of the Emancipation Proclamation started with words because it invited artists to suppress imagination and focus on the literal,” Holzer said.
Just as there were positive portrayals of Lincoln following the Emancipation Proclamation, there were also caricatures deriding him for the decision.
The New York World, a publication that catered to Confederate sensibilities, portrayed Lincoln as an African king on the front cover, and ran a feature on “Abraham Africanus I—His Secret Life”.
The most famous portrayal of Lincoln is arguably the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. Holzer commented on the segregated crowd at the memorial’s dedication in 1922, describing the way in which the memorial has since served as a backdrop for diverse events ranging from Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech to Glenn Beck’s recent “Restoring Honor” rally.
Holzer also discussed the 2003 dedication of a statue commemorating Lincoln’s visit to Richmond, Virginia, on April 4, 1865.
“What is remarkable is how benign a statue this is—it shows Lincoln sitting with his son Tad on a bench—and how much controversy the statue elicited,” Holzer said. “There were rebel yells and anti-Lincoln banters, and all this in front of the historic Tredegar Iron Works, now a Civil War museum, where munitions were manufactured for the South with slave labor.”
Holzer said that he thinks the statue is inappropriate since it does not portray the recently emancipated African Americans who saw Lincoln that day.
But it is often most important for modern public sculptures to provide a good photo opportunity, according to Holzer.
Audience members included Professor Henry Louis “Skip” Gates Jr, who chairs of the Du Bois Institute—the organization sponsoring the Nathan I. Huggins Lecture Series.
“This is the most prestigious lecture series on African American studies in the country, and Holzer is the leading commentator on Abraham Lincoln,” Gates said. “This series is particularly relevant because changing representations of Lincoln are a way of indicating how Americans feel about race relations.”

Six Teach for America alumni discussed the impact of the program on the current education system and the widening achievement gap during a panel held in Quincy House last night.
The panelists—four of whom are Harvard University graduate students—spoke about the challenges in the American education system, which include teacher tenure policies and the disparity between public and charter schools.
But all agreed that Teach for America can play in role in improving some of the flaws the system.
“Getting talented, hard-working people who genuinely care and want to make a difference into a classroom where they can solve real problems” is the most direct way to address the achievement gap, said Anasstassia Baichorova, a senior recruitment director for TFA.
The panelists also answered the audience’s questions on their experiences in the TFA program.
“Students here have a great opportunity to really make some changes that they can’t make if they’re in a classroom,” said C.J. Crowder, a TFA alumnus and Quincy House resident affiliate. “That can’t happen unless they’re in a program like Teach for America.”
Several students who attended the program said the panel influenced their decision to apply for TFA.
Though she said she had not felt persuaded to apply in the past, Emily M. Orlins ’11 said the panel helped change her mind.
“I feel like I’ve been going to info sessions for TFA for the last four years, but I think this panel was the first one that said, ‘This was really worth it and this is why,’” Orlins said.
Even though Lam Pham ’11 has already applied to the program, he said hearing about the experiences of the panelists reinforced his desire to participate.
“It didn’t feel to me that anyone was trying to brainwash me into one way of thinking about social justice or education or closing the achievement gap,” Pham said.
Crowder said he hopes to host more events about TFA in the future to encourage students to apply.
“I’d like to do dinners where we could have some more folks sit down,” Crowder said. “Instead of having people talk for 30 minutes, you could just have those one-on-one conversations so people could really learn about the experience.”

Applications to Harvard Law School have increased in the wake of the financial crisis, and incoming students have reported the most work experience before matriculating since World War II.
According to Assistant Dean and Chief Admissions Officer Joshua Rubenstein, the number of applicants rose from 7,168 in 2008 to 7,610 in 2010.
The number of applicants tends to correlate with fluctuations in gross domestic product, Rubenstein added. In other words, as the economy worsens, more people pursue advanced degrees.
For the first time in decades, 72 percent of students in the Law School’s Class of 2013 took time off after graduating from college, and more than half of the class took two or more years off to work or pursue other interests before enrolling at the Law School.
Rubenstein attributed the trend in part to the Law School’s new leadership, which he said has placed “a renewed emphasis on experience.”
This year marks Rubenstein’s second year heading the admissions office and Martha L. Minow’s second year as Dean of the Law School.
The New York Times reported last January that despite rising LSAT scores, Mexican-American and African-American students are being accepted to law schools at lower rates nationally. But students of color comprise 37 percent of the Law School’s student body this year—a higher percentage than ever before, Rubenstein said.
According to Rubenstein, the overall increase in applicants has made the pool of prospective students more competitive.
“Experience is something we look for in the admissions process,” Rubenstein said. “People with work experience typically have strong leadership skills and bring good perspectives to the community. They have a strong idea of what they want to get out of law school.”
Benny Belvin II, an assistant director at the Office of Career Services, said he has recommended that students take time off before applying to law school to gain a competitive edge in the application process.
Deferrals—which the Law School doesn’t consider in admissions decisions—likely account for the reported increase in applicants with job experience.
OCS Director Robin Mount said she has seen an increase in the number of students applying to law school and deferring enrollment.
Mount said she believes many students feel that their Harvard degree will shield them from the poor economy.
“Harvard students tend to think there’s going to be a job for me,” Mount said. “Unfortunately, when the economy is bad, law schools don’t add 100 more spots.”
Job security is on the mind of many applicants.
“My mother emphasizes having a career with a stable salary and a degree so that my kids won’t starve,” said a junior at a recent law school info session. The student requested to remain anonymous because of concerns about privacy in the admissions process.
“Law school is a good door to everything,” the junior added.

Researchers could be closer to more effectively preventing and treating Parkinson’s disease after a Harvard-led study discovered that defects in cellular energetics may lead to the disease.
The study—which was published Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine—analyzed gene sets in 410 samples from patients with symptomatic Parkinson’s disease. Researchers found 10 gene sets that pinpointed defects in cellular processes that produce energy, including processes in the mitochondria, an energy-making organelle in human cells. The researchers identified a gene that could serve as a “switch” to increase cellular energetics.
“We found that this energy-producing machinery was controlled by a regulator switch, which pointed us toward a mechanism to how we could reverse this reduced activity,” said Clemens R. Scherzer, an assistant professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and senior author of the study.
This “regulator switch” is a gene named proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha). Reactivating the PGC-1 alpha gene could lead to proper modulation of cellular energetics that would then help patients at risk for or suffering from Parkinson’s disease, Scherzer said.
Patients with Parkinson’s disease lose a specific type of brain cell called dopaminergic neurons, which play a role in controlling voluntary movement. An activated PGC-1 alpha gene blocks the toxic effects of Parkinson’s disease, protecting these neurons.
“I thought that [the study] really convincingly shows that there are mitochondrial defects in Parkinson’s disease that occur very early and are not just located in the cells that degenerate,” said J. Timothy Greenamyre, a University of Pittsburgh neurology professor who directs the Pittsburgh Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease.
“There have been hints of this for probably a good 20 years, but this really pins it down definitively,” he added.
Drugs that can turn on the PGC-1 alpha gene have already been designed for patients with diabetes. Pharmaceutical companies can now test similar medications for patients with Parkinson’s.
The researchers added that further work is still needed.
“We’re still a long way from the cure, but it’s exciting because it restores hope for the patient population,” said Marcia A. McCall, a research coordinator at the University of Southern Florida.

Harvard Business School Professor Stephen A. Greyser ’56 recently received the 2010 Sports Marketing Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Marketing Association for his “distinguished career contributions to the scientific understanding of sports business.”
Greyser, an emeritus professor of business administration at the Business School, co-developed and taught the first sports business course offered at the Business School 30 years ago.
“To me, this award is a culmination of, but not the end of, my career,” said Greyser, who earned both his MBA and doctorate at the Business School. “My dual involvement with sports, in terms of the sport of spots and the business of sports, comes together in this award.”
Greyser—who began his research in sports business in the 1970s, when he wrote a case study on the marketing of the Boston Celtics—has written numerous cases and authored several books on management and marketing.
“The business of sports has grown to be so huge,” Greyser said, adding that sports business is “one of the fields I’ve put in a good deal of my intellectual activity.”
Greyser, who can recite sports statistics from memory, said that he has been a sports fan since he was a child, when he and his father attended numerous professional sporting events together. A Boston native, he has been a longtime Celtics and Red Sox season-ticket holder.
“I have been able to make my passion into my work,” Greyser wrote in a Business School press release.
He added that his work in sports began early. He was a sports color commentator for WHRB, the Harvard College radio station, during his undergraduate years.
He is known by his students and colleagues as the Cal Ripken of the Business School for having never missed his class during his 42-year tenure.
Cal Ripken, a former Major League Baseball player, currently holds the record for the greatest number of games played consecutively.
Greyser teaches courses at both the Business School and the Harvard Extension School, and is a Trustee of WHRB, a Winthrop House Faculty Associate, and the faculty advisor of the Business School’s Business of Sports Club. He also supervises MBA field studies.
Greyser said that he will continue his work in the field of sports management and marketing with a special interest in global sports business.

Credit Suisse CEO Brady W. Dougan delivered candid remarks on the future of financial markets, the effects of the economic crisis on finance, and the current hiring season in the financial industry to an audience of nearly 200 at the Charles Hotel last night.
Dougan cited the dynamic, fast-paced nature of the industry when explaining why he believes students should pursue a career in financial services.
“If you’re smart, hardworking, and take initiative, finance is one of the best businesses to get into,” Dougan said.
But he had a more cautious outlook on the future of financial markets.
“The impact of the financial crisis will be far-reaching,” he said. “People and firms are rethinking who they do business with.”
When asked where he sees potential for growth, Dougan pointed to alternative energy, private banking, and emerging markets such as Indonesia and Brazil.
According to Dougan, about 20 percent of hiring for financial firms has historically been entry-level hires, while 80 percent has comprised lateral hiring from other firms.
Dougan said Credit Suisse aims to reverse this ratio and increase the percentage of hires from historically underrepresented groups in the industry, including women and minorities.
About 30 percent of the firm’s incoming employees are women, which is approximately the percentage of women students at Harvard Business School, Dougan said.
Betsy Covitt, Credit Suisse’s Campus Relations Manager for Harvard, said that while the firm’s hiring has been fairly consistent in past years, the economic downturn has affected all industries, including finance.
Jeffrey D. Homer ’13, treasurer of the Harvard Investment Association, said that bringing a CEO to Harvard was indicative of the larger financial industry’s greater focus on hiring currently.
“Job prospects seem to be improving compared to two or three years ago,” Homer said.
Mary C. Szpak ’11, who will be joining the Credit Suisse team after graduation as a full time analyst on the institutional sales desk, balanced the public’s view of the industry with her own experiences.
“Bankers are considered the bad guys by the public,” she said. “But this is a business that is resilient and is not going away anytime soon.”

Save Our Skyline—a civilian coalition that accused the Cambridge City Council of allowing the city to be “‘corporatized’ by a proliferation of large illuminated signs”—has continued to garner support in their petition drive despite accusations of misinformation and personal revenge.
The petition opposes an amendment the council passed last Monday that includes provisions to increase the building sign height limit in Cambridge and to repeal the “variance process.”
The process is a legal procedure of granting exemption to business owners when they want to put up a sign larger than the legal limit.
Coalition spokeswoman Karen Schwartzman called the amendment “detrimental” to the Cambridge skyline.
“These are not signs that help people identify places they need to find,” she said. “These are corporate advertising.”
Schwartzman added that the petition collected thousands of signatures as of yesterday afternoon, though she declined to disclose the specific number.
Meanwhile, critics have denounced the coalition as a misleading campaign motivated by a personal vendetta.
Critics point out that the amendment could potentially allow Microsoft—a competitor of Phillip T. Ragon’s multimillion dollar software company Intersystems Corp.—to place a large sign atop One Memorial Drive, where the two companies share office space.
In a letter posted on the website of Save Our Skyline, Ragon said that as a Cambridge citizen for more than 30 years, he supports the petition because he the amendment would “fundamentally alter the visual character of Cambridge.”
Though Schwartzman did not deny funding from Ragon, she said that Ragon only supported the campaign as a concerned Cambridge citizen.
But James J. Rafferty, an attorney familiar with zoning law in Cambridge, called Schwartzman’s claim “ridiculous,” citing the long history of rivalry between Ragon’s company and Microsoft.
According to the Boston Globe, Ragon’s company sued Microsoft and the owner of One Memorial Drive when Microsoft tried to move into the building in 2008, arguing that “we want to stay in our building [because] it’s very much our home.”
Ragon also claimed in his letter that without the variance process, it becomes easier for business owners to obtain special permission for large signs.
In the variance process, the council grants exemptions to regulations on sign size if the council decides that not doing so would constitute a “hardship” for the business owner—a test that Schwartzman and Ragon said is a stringent limitation on multinational corporations.
However, according to Councilor Leland Cheung, the present amendment puts strict rules on paper, as opposed to the more subjective judgments made in the variance process.
“I respectfully disagree with Councilor Cheung,” Schwartzman said, because “variance is far less subjective than a special permit process.”

Former Florida Governor John E. “Jeb” Bush will serve as a Visiting Fellow at the Institute of Politics from Nov. 15 to 19, the IOP announced yesterday.
The IOP approached Bush near the end of last semester, according to IOP Fellows and Study Groups Coordinator Eric R. Andersen.
According to Andersen, Bush—the younger brother of former President George W. Bush and the son of former President George H.W. Bush—has always been “a name of interest” in responses to the surveys the IOP sends to students and affiliated campus organizations.
“I think he is somebody who has been on our radar screen for a while as someone who is interesting and who has been a big player both in Florida and on the national stage,” IOP President P. Kenzie Bok ’11 said.
Harvard Republican Club President Mark A. Isaacson ’11 said he was “thrilled” to hear of Bush’s upcoming visit.
“I’m sure our club will be excited to have the opportunity to interact and learn from him,” Isaacson said.
Bush was the first Republican governor of Florida to have served two full four-year terms. As governor from 1999 to 2007, Bush focused on education reform in the state.
His “A+ Plan” made standardized testing mandatory, implemented a stricter class advancement policy, and funded schools based on the statewide Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test grading system.
“He was very dedicated to education reform in Florida, and he certainly has a great mind for policy,” Isaacson said.
Although the schedule for his week-long visit is still tentative, like all IOP Visiting Fellows, Bush is slated to participate in off-the-record discussions with student groups and meet with several students, Andersen said.
According to Andersen, Bush has expressed interest in discussing an array of subjects, though education reform is a topic of interest.
“He has a great deal to offer the student body, to everyone—not just our club,” Isaacson said.

Slated to feature the presentations of more than 30 papers on a variety of subjects within the field of Celtic studies, the 30th annual Harvard Celtic Colloquium began last night and will continue throughout the weekend.
The colloquium, which students in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences’ Department of Celtic Languages and Literatures have organized every year since 1980, is one of three major Celtic conferences in the United States.
This year’s paper topics range from the medieval to the modern, from the “Wise Women and Wanton Warriors in Early Irish Literature” to the manipulation of Welsh public opinion in the 1980s and 1990s.
According to Catherine McKenna, chair of the Celtic languages and literatures department, the colloquium “is the central event of what [the department] does publicly.
“it’s our major interface with a larger scholarly world,” she said.
A defining aspect of Harvard’s colloquium is that it is run entirely by graduate students, McKenna said.
Each year, two third-year graduate students run the conference with the assistance of two second-year graduate students.
This year, third-year students Margaret A. Harrison ’05 and Erin D. Boon organized the colloquium with the assistance of Albert Joseph “Joey” McMullen III and Natasha Sumner.
Harrison, who concentrated in folklore and mythology as an undergraduate at the College, said that the colloquium raises the profile of Harvard’s graduate program in Celtic studies.
Currently, undergraduates can earn a secondary field in the subject.
“[The conference] certainly does showcase the breadth of interests that exist in Celtic studies,” she said.
Harrison added that the graduate program in Celtic studies is the only one of its kind in the United States.
“It’s wonderful that the department exists at all,” she said. “It’s hard to look at a tiny department that’s holding on by its fingernails in this economy.”
Matthieu W. Boyd—a doctoral student in Celtic studies who has organized the colloquium in the past—said he hopes that the 30th anniversary of the colloquium will help draw the link between Celtic studies and other disciplines.
“My hope is that this will happen sooner rather than later—that people in the English department get in a dialogue with Celtic studies,” he said.

Facing an already high student-to-faculty ratio, the department of psychology is anxious to resume hiring.
The size of its faculty has shrunk to 24—a four-decade low. The number of professors had hovered around 27 over the past four decades.
Space and budgetary constraints have prevented the department from replacing departing professors.
“We can’t run our department on what we’ve got,” said Department Chair Susan E. Carey ’64.
While many departments in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences grew during the more financially stable years in the early 2000s—during this time, the Faculty expanded from 589 to 712 members—the psychology department’s size remained static because the department could not find physical space for incoming professors.
By the time rooms and laboratory space in the new Northwest Science Building were available for the department, FAS had imposed heavy limitations on faculty hires in response to the 30-percent drop in the University’s endowment in 2009.
But as the financial situation of FAS improves, members of the department said they are hoping FAS Dean Michael D. Smith will authorize the faculty searches the department needs to bring it back to its typical size.
Department members said that while they understand that other FAS departments are also in need of new professors after nearly two years of reduced hiring, they are making their voices heard in the FAS administration.
“We are an opinionated department,” said Psychology Professor Mahzarin R. Banaji, the head tutor in the department.
“We have on multiple occasions sent word that we hope that we will not be penalized for having been good citizens in the past,” she said, referring to the years of FAS expansion when the department held off on hiring.
Psychology Professor Marc D. Hauser’s unexpected year-long leave of absence in the wake of allegations of misconduct this summer has only further reduced the size of the department’s faculty for the year.
The psychology department, which had consisted of around 27 faculty members in total since the 1960s, is currently conducting two searches for junior members, according to Carey.
But with 24 faculty members and 192 junior and senior concentrators, the department is facing one of the largest student to faculty ratios in the College, said Banaji.
Psychology ranks as the fourth largest undergraduate concentration at the College.
By contrast, the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology has more than 30 professors for 121 declared concentrators.
“This is something that I’m hoping the administration really takes a hard look at,” Banaji said, referencing the psychology department’s need for a larger faculty.
“I am very worried that our competitor schools will grab some amazing candidates, and that we will not be able to maintain our absolutely incredible position,” Banaji added.
Undergraduate Advising Administrator Laura L. Chivers said the department was forced last spring to offer fewer courses because of its limited resources.
As a result of the reduction in course offerings, she said, some courses that were planned for 20 students saw more than 100 students shop the course.
“At that point in time, we worked very hard to try to make sure that students who needed classes to graduate at least got in to those,” Chivers said.
For the current academic year, the FAS administration has provided additional funding for temporary teaching positions such as guest lecturers—professors who come to temporarily teach in FAS—and Harvard graduate students.
Added manpower has enabled the department to offer smaller seminar courses, some of which were postponed last year. Chivers said students have benefitted from the staff additions.
“Having some flexibility about the courses at the upper level can only help the undergraduate experience,” Chivers said.

Colorful clouds of scented air and test tubes filled with food and drinks were among the experimental exhibits on display last night at the second annual opening celebration for The Laboratory at Harvard.
The Lab, a three-year pilot project, aims to foster innovation by integrating the arts and the sciences. Its reach extends beyond its exhibition space at the Northwest Science Building, with projects that have taken students around the world—from Paris to Cape Town.
The opening event, which featured music, cocktails, and interactive exhibits, was itself an experiment and a “performative, socially interactive way” to present student ideas, according to David A. Edwards, faculty director of The Lab and a professor at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
“Education is evolving at the University,” Edwards said.
The event showcased two primary exhibits. The Project on Spatial Sciences—an interdisciplinary effort at the Graduate School of Design developed by bioengineers, artists, and gastronomists—explored the idea of space through smell and taste. Attendees, who walked through scented smoke while sampling food and drinks, were able to experience space through alternate senses.
Korey “Nate” Tucker ’14 said that the experience was like “tasting the air.”
And according to David R. Palmer ’14, some scents were more “oppressive” and “powerful” than others.
Attendees also experimented with Soccket, a soccer ball that generates and stores energy when kicked.
Jessica S. Lin ’09, a former Crimson photo editor and current fellow at The Lab, was one of four Harvard students who designed the project.
“It highlights one of the artistic and scientific purposes of The Lab—to learn by doing,” Lin said.
The Lab serves as a forum for interdisciplinary experimentation and exhibiting the thinking process without fear of failure, according to Suelin Chen, director of The Lab.
“There are not a lot of platforms for that at Harvard,” Chen said. “But sharing your ideas is a way everyone can learn.”
Sharing ideas—or “cultural exhibitionism”—was the topic of a panel discussion that preceded last night’s celebration.
Four scholars from different fields addressed a packed audience on how art and science can be driving forces for communication, emphasizing that exhibits like those found at the Lab have the ability to change how people think.
“Tonight is just a perfect example of how people want to see cool, collaborative things at Harvard,” Lin said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s not often that someone cracks a joke at a tense meeting between Allston community members and Harvard administrators. But yesterday morning, at Allston Work Team Co-chair Bill Purcell’s monthly coffee hour, resident John McQueen did exactly that.
“How many psychiatrists does it take to change a light bulb?” McQueen asked Purcell.
Purcell said he didn’t know.
“One,” McQueen answered, smiling. “But it has to really want to change.”
Purcell laughed.
McQueen was referring to what he calls Harvard’s consistency in keeping Allston residents out of the loop on the status of its expansion into the neighborhood—especially since last December, when construction on Harvard’s $1 billion Allston Science Complex was indefinitely suspended.
McQueen said that Harvard is an institution accustomed to making decisions behind closed doors, but its expansion into Allston requires that it involve the community in the planning process.
The coffee hour took place inside the green, periwinkle, red, and orange walls of the Harvard Allston Education Portal, where Harvard administrators and Allston residents sat in a circle in brightly colored chairs, eating Dunkin’ Donuts and sipping coffee.
Much of the discussion at the coffee hour focused on the University’s recent hiring of two real estate consulting firms, Leggat McCall and McCall & Almy, to help draft a blueprint for Harvard’s future development in Allston.
Allston Resident and Harvard employee Robert Breslin, who said that he normally agrees with the University “95 percent of the time,” characterized Harvard’s hiring of consultants without consulting the Allson community first as “backroom dealing.”
Echoing these sentiments, community members said that they wanted an opportunity to speak with the consultants about their ideas for how Harvard could develop its real estate holdings in the neighborhood in a mutually beneficial way.
“We’d like a chance to learn things from sitting down with these people, too,” Allston resident Harry Mattison said. “Throw us a bone. Bring these folks into a community meeting.”
Purcell said that the University would make use of its consultants for “internal” planning purposes—specifically to help Harvard conceive of ways of potentially co-developing property in Allston with other private institutions, Purcell added.
“The first thing is to understand ... [how] to use the private people who know this market best, right now, this moment,” Purcell said.
He added that he discusses all the concerns community members air during his monthly coffee hours with the rest of the Allston Work Team and Harvard’s consultants.
After the meeting, University Spokesperson Lauren Marshall wrote in an e-mail that Purcell plans to invite the consultants to attend a future coffee hour.
In the past, Purcell has invited other experts to speak to the community, including Chief University Planner Kathy Spiegelman.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every week, our Around the Ivies team comes up with some witty way to present the state of Ancient Eight football. So as I sat in Logan Airport yesterday morning, I thought of all the comparisons I could make between my experience in the Southwest terminal and Ivy League sports.
Perhaps I could talk about the fact that, just like my sister and I were waiting for our delayed flight, pretty much every Ivy football team is biding its time this week. With the exception of the Dartmouth-Yale matchup, every game should either be a lopsided result, a meaningless non-conference tilt, or both. By this time next week, we’ll probably have no better idea of how the title race will play out.
Or maybe I could talk about how some of the conference’s best teams get to take a little bit of a vacation this weekend. After Bucknell and Cornell battled it out in a suckfest last weekend, they’re now playing last year’s Ivy champion and runner-up, respectively. Penn and Harvard should be able to really enjoy this three-day weekend.
But who am I kidding? I’m not that funny. And I’m writing this column on an airplane. Let’s just get to the picks.
BROWN (2-1, 1-0 Ivy)                                  at HOLY CROSS (2-3, 0-1 Patriot)
This matchup between the Crimson’s Week 1 and Week 2 opponents should be a whole lot more interesting than one may have thought two weeks ago. Holy Cross got back on track last weekend with a win over Fordham, a team that’s already beaten both Columbia and URI, the team Brown lost to in overtime last weekend.
Two of the Bears’ games have already gone past regulation, and the only time they’ve looked really good was in their win over Harvard. But in that game, they looked really, really good. Kyle Newhall-Caballero, who threw for 325 yards last week in his first start after breaking his throwing hand, is just a much better quarterback than Crusader signal-caller Ryan Taggart, and he’s only going to get better as he gets used to his new receivers.
Prediction: Brown 21, Holy Cross 10.
PRINCETON (1-2, 0-1)                                  at COLGATE (2-2, 1-0 Patriot)
Colgate boasts the best running back in the Patriot League in Nate Eachus, who is averaging a gaudy 160 yards per game—nearly 90 yards per game more than the second-best back—and scored four touchdowns last week. But that’s all the Raiders have got on offense. Meanwhile, Princeton standout tailback Jordan Culbreath—the best running back in the Ivy League in 2008, his last full season—is only averaging 55 yards per game with a single touchdown, but that TD was a double-overtime game-winner.
The Tigers have the advantage of a balanced attack, with quarterback Tommy Wornham averaging 286 yards per game. But neither Colgate nor Princeton has lost at home this season, and neither has won on the road. I’m betting Eachus will run over the Tiger defense on his way to securing another home win for the Raiders.
Prediction: Colgate 24, Princeton 17.
BUCKNELL (0-4, 0-0 Patriot)                                 at PENN (2-1, 1-0 Ivy)
Penn fans probably got a little anxious when former Ivy doormat Dartmouth pushed the Quakers to overtime at Franklin Field last weekend. Well, not to worry, Pennsylvania faithful—current Patriot League doormat Bucknell is on the docket this weekend. The Bison lost to Cornell last weekend (Cornell!). I’m pretty sure the Quakers wouldn’t be overmatched if they put their JV squad out there. But they won’t, so I’m going to be so bold as to call this one a shutout.
Prediction: Penn 27, Bucknell 0.
LAFAYETTE (0-4, 0-1 Patriot)                                at COLUMBIA (2-1, 1-0)
As Lafayette coach Frank Tavani said after the Leopards’ loss to Harvard last week, “It doesn’t get any easier, because Columbia is absolutely blowing Princeton off the field right now.”
Lafayette heads to New York to take on a Lions team that—on the strength of five Sean Brackett touchdowns—did in fact annihilate the Tigers last Saturday. Yes, that same Princeton team that beat the Leopards in double overtime two weeks ago. Columbia > Princeton > Lafayette. Easy math.
Prediction: Columbia 28, Lafayette 17.
YALE (2-1, 1-0 Ivy)                                              at DARTMOUTH (2-1, 0-1 Ivy)
Last year, we mercilessly mocked Dartmouth for its seeming inability to play a decent game of football. When the Big Green started the season 2-0, it won over some believers (including me, who boldly picked the squad to finish fourth in the conference in our preseason supplement). But after taking the Quakers to overtime last week, the message should be pretty clear: Dartmouth is officially on the rise.
The Big Green matches up pretty well with Yale. Both teams feature a balanced offense spearheaded by a pair of juniors. Dartmouth has the slight edge on the ground with junior tailback Nick Schwieger (tops in the Ivy League at 144 yards per game), while Bulldog quarterback Patrick Witt has the advantage in the air (averaging 290 yards per game).
This one could be close, but the Big Green is a second-half team—it’s outscored its opponents, 62-14, after halftime this season—and Yale’s only two wins came against teams that went a combined 2-19 in 2009. Look for Dartmouth to cement its place as a team to watch in the Ancient Eight.
Prediction: Dartmouth 27, Yale 21.
CORNELL (1-2, 0-1 Ivy)                                                 at HARVARD (2-1, 0-1 Ivy)
Cornell is this year’s Dartmouth—a football team that most Texas high school squads could probably take down. A meeting with the hapless Big Red is exactly what Harvard needs to even its Ivy record. In Ithaca last year, senior Gino Gordon and sophomore Treavor Scales ran right through the Cornell defense, spearheading a 251-yard, four-touchdown Crimson rushing performance.
With Gordon coming off a monster 170-yard, two-TD game at Lafayette last week, all signs point to Harvard demolishing the Big Red once again. The most interesting question at this point is whether or not the senior can top that 74-yard run to the endzone.
Prediction: Harvard 31, Cornell 7.

Tomorrow at noon, the Harvard football team will look build on its success against non-conference opponents and notch its first Ivy League win of the season when it takes on Cornell (1-2, 0-1 Ivy) at Harvard Stadium.
Last Saturday, the Crimson (2-1, 0-1) had a bounce-back victory against Lafayette, 35-10, after dropping its Ivy League opener to Brown the previous weekend. The team hopes to capitalize on that momentum as it resumes conference play against the Big Red.
“This [game] has some extra importance obviously because we have to get back into the Ivy League race, which is a situation we haven’t been in for a long time,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “We’re usually not winless in the Ivy League, so it’s a big game.”
The preseason favorites to capture a fourth Ancient Eight crown in the last five years, Harvard fell behind early in the conference standings with the Week 2 loss to the Bears. The Crimson will try to even out its Ivy League record at 1-1 with a win against Cornell.
“[Preparing for the Big Red] isn’t any different, that’s for sure,” Murphy said. “Obviously, each game plan is a little bit different depending on the opponent, the scheme, the personnel, and the tendencies. Obviously, there are some subtleties there that we’re focusing on.”
When Harvard took on the Leopards last weekend, it played without senior quarterback Andrew Hatch, inactive after suffering a concussion. In his place, sophomore Colton Chapple completed six of 11 passes for 82 yards and a touchdown on his way to becoming the eighth Crimson quarterback of the last nine to win his collegiate debut.
But the inexperienced arm of Chapple at the helm meant that Harvard had to rely on its running backs more than it had earlier in the season. The proven tandem of senior Gino Gordon and sophomore Treavor Scales as well as the play of sophomore Rich Zajeski stepped up to the tune of 311 yards on the ground and a combined total of four touchdowns.
“We’re definitely going to try to refind [the balance between the pass and the run],” Murphy said. “For us to reach our goals, for us to keep winning football games, we’re not going to be able to throw the ball 11 times a game. It’s that simple.”
“We’ve got to take what [the opponent] gives us,” added senior wide receiver Marco Iannuzzi. “Running gives us ball security, and as long as we continue to have success with that and until we find that offensive balance, we’ll stick with what works.”
The Crimson defense, meanwhile, has held its opponents to 10 or fewer points in two of its three games. Against the Leopards, senior defensive tackle Josue Ortiz recorded his third sack in as many games this season.
“Our defense has played amazing this season,” Iannuzzi said. “As a member of the offense, I speak for everyone when I say we have to get them off the field and take advantage of all the opportunities they give us.”
“We’ve got a bend-but-don’t-break defense,” Murphy said. “We’ve allowed some teams to move the ball, but we’ve done a good job keeping them from scoring...Even against Brown, I thought we did a good job. We just put ourselves in too many bad situations.”
Cornell, meanwhile, is fresh off of its first victory under new head coach Kent Austin. The Big Red defeated Bucknell, 21-12, despite posting fewer yards than the Bison—303 to Bucknell’s 372—and turning the ball over four times.
An intriguing subplot to watch out for is the matchup between the Harvard ground game and Cornell’s run defense. The Big Red defense was able to limit the Bison to just 105 yards on the ground on 28 attempts. Cornell will have to deal with a Crimson rushing attack that gained 6.6 yards per carry in its last time out.
On top of this matchup, the Big Red is facing a number of questions regarding its personnel due to a string of injuries to its offensive linemen, the loss of two of its top tailbacks, and the inexperience of its rookie quarterback, Jeff Mathews.
“Cornell is a team that we certainly respect,” Murphy said, “but they’ve struggled moving the football and scoring points with their freshman quarterback.”
The Big Red is on a six-game winless streak against conference opponents and has not won against Harvard since 2005.  But this game is a must-win for both teams if they wish to continue to pursue the Ivy League title. If history proves true, a loss for either team could prove insurmountable. It has been 28 years since a team with two conference losses has claimed even share of the Ivy League title.

The Harvard women’s field hockey team has a tough schedule this weekend as it travels to the west coast to face No. 17 Stanford today in Palo Alto, Calif., and California on Sunday in Berkley, Calif.
The Crimson (3-7, 1-2 Ivy) looks to rebound from back-to-back losses last weekend against Brown and Bucknell, but the nationally ranked Cardinal (7-3, 3-1 NorPac) and the conference-leading Golden Bears (5-6, 4-0 NorPac) will be a formidable test. Both teams have proven that they can compete with the best, as Stanford beat No. 9 Wake Forest in late September and California upset the Cardinal during the same month.
“We are excited to play in California,” sophomore forward Emma Keller said. “We are definitely looking forward to putting a couple of new points in our game. We had a couple of losses lately, and after analyzing the game, we’ve come up with some things to work on before traveling [out west].”
The road trip will be a true test for the Harvard defense as it tries to slow down two high-octane offenses, which average 2.9 and 2.5 goals per game, for Stanford and the Golden Bears respectively. Sophomore goalie Cynthia Tassopoulos, who has racked up 59 saves throughout the season with a .747 save percentage, will be the Crimson’s last line of defense. She will need to stop the likes of Cardinal junior Stephanie Byrne, who leads her team with 5 goals and 11 points, and California sophomore Claire Dougherty, who boasts a team-high 7 goals and 15 points.
“Our defense is definitely one of our strongest points,” sophomore back Kim Goh said. “I think our greatest asset is our composure. That’s really the best you can do against teams with skilled forwards and quick players—to not get caught watching, to hold and be patient until you are ready to take advantage of the situation.”
Stanford comes into the match riding the momentum of a two-game winning streak, having defeated UC Davis, 2-1, in overtime last weekend. The Cardinal likes to turn it on in the second half, as it has outshoot, 72-38, and outscored its opponents, 11-5, while racking up 76 penalty corners in the second period so far this season. Byrne is established as the go-to player late in the game, tallying four game-winners, the last of which came against the Aggies last Saturday. The trio of Byne, sophomore Becky Dru, and senior Xanthe Travlos have combined for more than half of Stanford’s shots.
Harvard will have to match the intensity of the Cardinal, especially on offense. Stanford has limited its opponents to just 7.6 shots and 1.4 goals per game. Given that the Crimson has failed to score in three of its last four losses, Harvard will need to make every opportunity count.
“We are definitely looking to make some attacking changes,” Goh said. “As a team, we are just working on getting an attacking mindset—the idea that when we get the ball we have to throw everything we have [to get] the goal.”
“We are working on our offensive third,” Keller said. “When we penetrate the circle, we are putting a huge emphasis on holding the ball in our offensive circle, getting a penalty corner, getting a shot on net, really getting a solid return on our penetration.”
The Crimson’s opponent on Sunday, California, has won three of its last five but is looking to rebound from tough losses to the No. 9 Demon Deacons and No. 2 North Carolina. The Golden Bears rank fourth in the nation in defensive saves with 6, and 15th in assists per game with 2.5.
Although California has earned 75 penalty corners so far this season, it has given up 78. If Harvard is given an opportunity to score, it will have a chance to beat either junior Maddie Hand or sophomore Haleh Nourani in goal. The Golden Bears’ duo, which has a combined 67 saves, will face challenges from Chloe Keating, who leads the Crimson with 14 points on five goals and four assists, and junior captain Carly Dickson, who has tallied four assists on the season as well.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s water polo is about to go coast-to-coast.
After an impressive 10-8 win over Cambridge-rival MIT at Blodgett Pool last Saturday, the Crimson will head west for five games against a host of California opponents.
This weekend, the Harvard team will play in Claremont, Calif., as a part of the Claremont Convergence. The tournament has become an annual part of the Crimson’s schedule and usually includes some of the country’s toughest competition.
This year Harvard will go up against Occidental, No. 18 Pomona-Pitzer, Caltech, and Claremont-M-S in tournament play, and then face No. 5 UC Santa Barbara in a regular non-conference game.
The Crimson went into the tournament last year with an undefeated conference record but ended up dropping all four of its matches.
Harvard has struggled to get on track at some points early this season. It holds a 4-8 overall record and has yet to get a conference win.
While some of the Crimson’s weekend opponents have had similarly slow starts to the season, others have proven their talent against high-ranked teams.
UC Santa Barbara is a part of the West Coast’s elite group of collegiate water polo squads and will present a challenge for Harvard as it has seven wins so far, six of which have come over teams ranked in the top 20 nationally.
Although Pomona-Pitzer has a losing record, it has faced some of the nation’s best teams in other California invitationals.
But considering Occidental and Caltech are a combined 1-15, the Crimson has a good chance to improve its season record before coming home for a stretch of conference matchups.

Each Friday, The Crimson will compile a series of unique statistics about Harvard's sports scene. Welcome to the Magic of Numbers—without the problem sets. We'll do the math for you.
SHADES OF RED
0 — Turnovers committed by the Harvard football team last week in its 35-10 win over Lafayette.
4 — Turnovers that Cornell gave up–three of which came on fumbles–in its lackluster 21-12 win over Bucknell last week. The Crimson will host the Big Red this Saturday at noon.
3 — Number of different starting quarterback for Harvard in the last four games dating back to last season: senior Collier Winters, senior Andrew Hatch, and sophomore Colton Chapple.
170 — Yards senior tailback Gino Gordon gained on the ground against Lafayette last week.
CALIFORNIA DREAMIN’
3135 — Miles the Harvard field hockey team will travel this weekend to play No. 17 Stanford and Cal.
1.87 — Goals-against average for sophomore goalkeeper Cynthia Tassopoulos, second-best in the Ivy League.
78 — Degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature forecast for Palo Alto, Calif., this Saturday when the Crimson take on the Cardinal.
LOOKING TO GET ON A ROLL
1 — Number of goals freshman Connor McCarthy scored in men’s soccer’s win over Holy Cross yesterday. It was McCarthy’s first collegiate goal.
11 — Number of goals the Crimson has allowed so far this season. Harvard has, in fact, shut out its last two opponents.
11 — Number of goals Harvard has scored so far this season. Scoring goals has been a concern for the Crimson this season as Harvard continues to look for a way to increase offensive output.

This weekend, Harvard takes on Cornell in multiple matches at home, giving students and Crimson fans plenty of conference matches to watch.
The football team faces off against Cornell tomorrow at noon, returning home after two games on the road at Brown and Lafayette. Currently, the squad stands at 2-1, with the only loss coming in its sole conference game against Brown. Harvard crushed the Big Red last season, 28-10, and holds an overall series record of 40-32-2.
Also on deck for tomorrow afternoon is the men’s soccer match at Ohiri Field versus Cornell. The team’s overall record is 4-3-3 and the men have won two of their three home games so far this season, the opening game against Stanford and the 1-0 victory last weekend over Yale. The Crimson is 3-0-1 in its last four matches with its conference rival, the last match with the Big Red ending in a 1-1 tie.
Just before the men take the field, the women’s soccer team will have its shot at Cornell. The women are currently 4-4-1 for the season, winning the last two matches against Massachusetts and Yale. They also have a 1-1-0 Ivy record. And, the women’s squad has history on its side: the Crimson has not lost to the Big Red since 1993 and has not lost a home match against Cornell since 1988.
Moving indoors to the Malkin Athletic Center, the women’s volleyball team plays against Cornell in the Crimson-Big Red faceoff weekend. After breaking a seven-game losing steak two weeks ago, the women dropped their second match of the season to Dartmouth. Currently, the squad stands at 3-11 and plays against Columbia tomorrow and Cornell on Sunday evening. Even though the Crimson does not have a great record this year, the women’s squad has defeated the Lions in the last eight matches and captured two matches against the Big Red last season.
While all of these teams are playing at home, the men’s water polo squad gets as far away as possible in the US and travels across the country for five matches. The men face Occidental and Pomona-Pitzer today, Caltech and Claremont tomorrow and UC Santa Barbara on Sunday. The men just defeated MIT, 10-8, last weekend and have the opportunity to go over .500 with these matches during the weekend. The team currently stands at 4-8.
The field hockey team also joins the men in California, taking on Stanford tonight and California on Sunday afternoon. The squad has had a rough season so far and dropped its past two matches against Brown and Bucknell. This will be Harvard’s first time playing on the West Coast.
In other sports events, the women’s tennis team heads to Flushing Meadows, N.Y. for the Billie Jean Invitational taking place tomorrow. Also, the men’s lacrosse team has an exhibition match against the U.S. National Team on Sunday at noon and the women have a match against the US National Team tomorrow night.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earlier this year The Crimson profiled two freshmen on Harvard golf, Bonnie Hu of the women’s team and Seiji Liu of the men’s. While Hu and Liu are off to fast starts, another freshman—one we overlooked—has been dominating on the links and playing his way to the top of the leader board.
After losing his match in the Harvard-Yale-Princeton meet (8 and 7) the first week of the season, men’s golfer Theo Lederhausen has been playing better than anyone on the team. At the McLaughlin, Lederhausen tied with junior Mark Pollak for a team-best +3 on the tournament, including a round of -1. At the MacDonald Cup last weekend, the freshman showed further improvement. Lederhausen shot even par on the event, including a round of -1 on the opening day. His finish tied for fifth place in the tournament.
“He definitely picked it up after our first match when we were a little disappointed in his performance,” junior captain Tony Grillo said. “We’re excited to see that he’s playing well.”
Last Sunday, in the final round of the MacDonald, Lederhausen teed off on the par-three fifth hole due to a shotgun start. From 145 yards away, the freshman knocked in a hole-in-one. He went on to shoot a 71 and lead the team in scoring for the second straight week.
“I think the most important part [of his success] is [he’s] feeling comfortable now—with the team, with the tournament set up, and with the differences of being on a college team,” Grillo said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It may be Columbus Day Weekend, but at Harvard, it sure feels a lot like the Fourth of July.
The Crimson plays host to the US Lacrosse Stars and Stripes event this weekend, in which the U.S. men’s and women’s national teams will square off with the Harvard lacrosse squads as well as a host of others.
The highlights of the action will include a match between the U.S. women’s senior national team and the Harvard women’s lacrosse squad tomorrow night at 7 p.m. at Soldiers Field Soccer Stadium, while the U.S. men’s national team will take on the Crimson men’s squad Sunday at noon at Harvard Stadium.
“It’s a big challenge since they’re a) older and b) some of the most accomplished players in the world,” sophomore attack Jeff Cohen said. “But we’re going to go into the game and compete and hopefully come out with the win.”
Nearly every player on the men’s national roster is a member of a Major League Lacrosse team. Six play for the local Boston Cannons, including 2009 MLL MVP Paul Rabil. They come from a large range of some of the best lacrosse schools in the country, including Crimson rivals Princeton and Cornell.
The team is coming off a gold medal in the Federation of International Lacrosse World Championships in July, knocking off Canada, 12-10, in a thrilling championship game.
The Harvard men, for their part, are looking to bounce back from a disappointing 2010 season in which they finished 6-6 and failed to make the NCAA Tournament. The team is highlighted by attacks Dean Gibbons and Cohen–who led the team with 29 and 27 goals respectively last season–and features junior Harry Krieger in net.
Despite the disappointing season, the Crimson hopes the exhibition can be a sign of good things to come. That was certainly the case for the 2010 Duke lacrosse team, which defeated the national team in January before going on to win a collegiate national championship four months later.
“It’s a really good opportunity for us to test how far we’ve come with [first-year] coach [Chris] Wojcik,” Cohen said.
Cohen added that playing the national team would be good preparation for someone like himself, who aspires to be a member of that team one day.
After the men's game on Sunday, the women's senior national team will partake in contests against Boston College and Boston University's women's lacrosse squads, while the women's U-19 team will take on high school lacrosse clubs.  The event will also feature two youth clinics given by the national teams.
The women’s senior national team won a gold medal at the 2009 Federation of International Lacrosse Women’s Lacrosse World Cup, in which it defeated Australia, 8-7, to take the title. Its roster contains recent graduates of and current players on Brown, Dartmouth, and Princeton, among others.
The Harvard women’s squad finished 6-10 in 2010.  It is led by sophomore attack Jen VanderMeulen, who scored a team-high 56 goals last season, and junior midfielder Melanie Baskind, who had 32 scores. Junior Kerry Clark takes over in net for departed senior Katherine Martino
"I think that we're all really excited for the opportunity to play the U.S. team," VanderMeulen said. "Coach [Lisa] Miller told us you usually only get to play the U.S. team once in your career...we've been practicing and practicing; we'll see how we come out against the best team in the world."

While we're on the topic of Final Clubs, here's a little tidbit of news. Tonight, Harvard undergraduates found fliers with the following text under their doors, reminiscent of Final Club punch invitations:
“You’re Invited to Join Us in…
NOT joining a Final Club
NOT attending Final Club parties
Taking a stand and demanding changes in Harvard’s social space”
The fliers advertise a meeting scheduled for next Friday, Oct. 15, in the Dunster JCR. The only other identifying information included is this e-mail address, finalclubcampaign@gmail.com. Intrigued? Watch us for updates.

The quick and dirty about what's been going on around theAncient Eight (and some other schools too).
After the police raid of a Yale undergraduate party last week at a New Haven nightclub, students attended a press conference this past Tuesday to respond to the police raid. Even though the police department has defended its actions, New Haven’s mayor,  John DeStefano Jr. said in an interview with the New York Times that the presence of officers in riot gear and SWAT team was “excessive and inappropriate” and “should not have been part” of the inspection.”
“We undertook 16 inspections over the past two weeks, and most went fine and accomplished our mission of enforcing under-age drinking,” DeStefano told The Times. “Clearly, there were some things that could have been better handled Friday night, and this department needs to look at that.”
At Brown, Professor Tricia Rose advocated in a Thursday night lecture the imperative to question the idea of a colorblind society. According to the Brown Daily Herald, Rose argued that “the ideology of color blindness has resulted in a ‘new racism’ that suppresses the study and research of race-specific topics.”
In New York City, Columbia launched on Thursday what the Columbia Daily Spectator calls the “first-ever” Center for Palestine Studies in the United States. Although the University’s Middle East initiative is over 50 years old, the center, created in the honor of former Columbia professor and prominent public intellectual Edward W. Said (who received a Ph.d from Harvard in English literature) is intended to promote Palestine studies in a diverse array of subjects that, according to the Daily Spectator, range from politics to the arts.
In North Carolina, Duke is back in the national spotlight for something related to the sexual practices of its students. This time, however, a 42-slide PowerPoint presentation created by Karen Owen ’10 that details the sexual performances of 13 Duke athletes went viral.

HerCampus, a national online women’s magazine created by four current and former Harvard students, has active readerships at Northwestern and the University of Illinois, but the site’s readership on Harvard’s campus has been comparatively lower.
Even though the site has roughly 500,000 page views per month and recently experienced a server malfunction due to high traffic, the publication is not universally recognized here at Harvard. The first seven females we asked about HerCampus all looked confused and slightly skeptical. Finally, the eighth, Tatiana Peralta ’11, said, “Maybe I’ve seen the logo.”
Further investigation led us to Kim Y. Warnick ’13 and Kellie P. Desrochers ’13, who both said they had heard of the online magazine over an e-mail list. But when asked if she would read the publication regularly, Desrochers replied in the negative.
“I don’t really know. It’s a really busy environment here. Maybe HerCampus would be another venue for procrastination.”
Last week, Harvard was not among HerCampus’ top 10 most active branches, according to Stephanie M. Kaplan ’10, one of the founders of HerCampus. She added that she isn’t sure where Harvard ranks among the site’s 60 branches in terms of readership.
“Traffic to the different branches varies a lot week to week depending on what events the branch is doing that week, that school's calendar, etc.,” wrote Kaplan in an e-mail to the Crimson, referring to the oscillation in rankings.
The two most visited branches last week were Northwestern and the University of Illinois, where sites had just been launched. The site has also been a hit at DePauw, a private liberal arts college with a 2,400 student population.
“Our overarching goal is to really make HerCampus an online hub for college women and a site that every college girl really feels like she should check everyday—after she looks at Facebook,” Kaplan said.

You can now own a piece of Facebook history for the low, low starting price of $19,000.
The domain name for Mark Zuckerberg’s website, facemash.com, is on sale on an online auction site. Facemash, created in 2003, “used photos compiled from the online facebooks of nine Houses, placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the ‘hotter’ person” according to an article in The Crimson after the site was taken down after about 22,000 page views.
“Were we let in for our looks? No. Will we be judged on them? Yes,” was the headline of the site when it was first put up.
The website was highly controversial and sparked contention around campus. Two of the most outspoken of the dissenters were student groups Fuerza Latina and the Association of Harvard Black Women.
But Zuckerberg’s intentions seem not to have been as malicious as The Social Network portrays them to be.
“It was basically a mistake. I thought the site was interesting mathematically, theoretically…” said Zuckerberg in an interview with The Crimson in 2003. “I didn’t mean for it to be released so quickly because I wanted to control peoples’ being offended by it.”
Zuckerberg issued apologizes to the offended groups, saying that his intention was to show the website to only a few of his friends. Zuckerberg’s website was also brought in front of the Administrative Board.
The website was picked after Zuckerberg let his ownership of the domain name expire. After being featured in the opening scenes of The Social Network, traffic for the site has “skyrocketed to 1,000 hits a day” according to the seller of the domain name.
The auction ends on October 25th, so if you are in the market for an expensive collectors item, better act now!
