After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

The Kennedy School announced this past week that it will merge two of its research centers. Beginning July 1, the Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations will be renamed the Hauser Institute for Civil Society and operate within the Center for Public Leadership, bringing together the research and leadership development efforts of the two bodies.
“The integration of the Hauser Institute within the Center for Public Leadership will ensure the continuation of successful programs and initiatives focused on leadership, as well as the advancement of scholarship and teaching related to the well-being of citizens and communities,” University President Drew G. Faust said in a press release Wednesday announcing the merger.
Max H. Bazerman and David R. Gergen, co-directors of the Center for Public Leadership, will lead the new combined effort. Current Hauser Center initiatives—such as research and programming for nonprofit leaders—will continue under the merger, and the Center for Public Leadership will also maintain its current leadership development programming. Christine W. Letts, a lecturer at the Kennedy School who is currently acting director of the Hauser Center, will serve as a senior adviser with a focus on integrating Hauser into the Center for Public Leadership.
In a phone interview, Gergen said the hope is that the merger “will advance the goals of not only the Kennedy School, but of the University itself,” calling the move “a very constructive marriage of strengths on the part of the two centers.” He noted that the merger will bring together the Hauser Center’s research tradition and the Center for Public Leadership’s focus on students.
Gergen added that, going forward, the expanded Center hopes to “engage more undergraduates” and would like to explore opportunities for students to participate in activities such as research to make the Center and the Kennedy School a welcome place for undergraduates.
Gergen said that the merger may face some logistical challenges. Because the two centers’ offices are housed in separate buildings at the Kennedy School, there are plans to bring faculty members together with a summer retreat for the two sets of staff members. A second retreat may be held in the fall.
"We're going to need to build personal ties to transcend the geographic separation," Gergen said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Speaking at a ribbon-cutting ceremony Friday celebrating the opening of the new Charlesview Residences apartment complex in Allston-Brighton, government and Harvard officials praised what they described as a successful collaboration between the community, several partners, and the City of Boston.
The 240 new mixed-income apartments are built on land that the University relinquished in 2007 in exchange for nearby property adjacent to Harvard Business School. The latter site, now owned by the University, has been home to the old Charlesview Apartments complex for 40 years.
Residents, many of whom will relocate from the old Charlesview Apartments, are beginning to move into the new complex on Monday, months ahead of a previous October target date. All residents of the old Charlesview Apartments will move to the new location.
“Thank you [to developers and funders] for [ful]filling the hope of a lot of these folks—that hope of living in decent living and sanitary conditions,” Boston mayor Thomas M. Menino said in remarks before the ribbon-cutting. “Today we have it, and it’s because the community said, ‘Enough’s enough, let’s work together,’ and a university...stepped up and said, ‘We want to be part of this success.’”
The new complex is part of the first phase of a development project in the neighborhood that will eventually grow to house 340 housing units. That first phase also includes the creation of a community center set to have its grand opening later this summer.
The new residences were co-developed by Charlesview, Inc., a nonprofit founded by several religious organizations that developed and managed the old apartments, and The Community Builders, Inc., a nonprofit developer of mixed-income housing. Among other funding sources, developers used money from the University given in the 2007 land swap to finance construction.
Menino was joined at the ceremony by a number of other speakers, including U.S. Rep. Michael E. Capuano, officials with several of the project’s partners, and former and current residents of the Charlesview apartments. In their remarks, most speakers hailed the opening of the complex as the product of a cooperative effort.
Thomas R. Gleason, the executive director of MassHousing, thanked Harvard and the AFL-CIO Housing Investment Trust, among others, for taking part in the project.
“This didn’t happen without you, and especially thanks for your money,” Gleason said.
Harvard was represented by Christine M. Heenan, vice president for public affairs and communications, who said in her remarks that perseverance and feedback from the community made the project possible.
“I really believe this project was strengthened by the critical input of residents, the critical input of neighbors,” Heenan said.
In the past, neighborhood residents have expressed mixed opinions of the land swap and criticized Harvard’s development plans for the site of the old apartments. Yet in an interview after the ceremony, Heenan said she believes the complex’s opening is a sign that the University’s relationship with the neighborhood is continuing to improve.
“This [project] is going to create a great deal of vibrancy and stitching together [of] Brighton and Allston,” Heenan said. “I think increased vibrancy for the neighborhood is very supportive of Harvard’s own plans to bring greater vibrancy to Barry’s Corner and North Harvard [Street] and Western Avenue.”
Tim McHale, a member of the Harvard-Allston Task Force, said in an interview after the ribbon-cutting that he is “very hopeful” and “very optimistic” about moving forward in discussions with Harvard about neighborhood issues, including a community benefits package to be included in Harvard’s new Institutional Master Plan for Allston development.
“I personally feel like everybody can be reasonable and open, and negotiations are negotiations,” said McHale, a Brighton resident who lives within close proximity of the new apartments.
