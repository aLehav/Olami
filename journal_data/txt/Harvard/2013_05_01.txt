After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earlier this month, President Drew G. Faust announced that the University would enlist Boston lawyer Michael B. Keating to prepare an independent, external review of the administration’s conduct throughout the Gov 1310 cheating scandal. Following several months of embarrassing blunders on the part of various administrators, this was a welcome development. Even more auspicious, however, was the recent announcement by William F. Lee, ’72, chair of the Harvard Corporation subcommittee that oversees the external review, that Keating’s findings will be made public to the Harvard community once completed.
This decision reflects a welcome change in the administration’s handling of the fiasco in that it may suggest a newfound commitment to transparency. Lack of transparency, of course, has been a key issue throughout the entire process, with perhaps the most notable example being Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds’ admission that she broke university policy and authorized two email searches without the requisite permission of Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Michael D. Smith. In general, the administration’s tight-lipped reaction to the email-search scandal has left students unsatisfied, and this lack of communication has led to confusion and distrust in an environment where trust is of vital importance.
It is for exactly these reasons that we commend Harvard for deciding to make Keating’s report public to the student body. We believe that doing so is a major step toward rebuilding an environment in which students can reasonably trust that the University will be honest and transparent in its operations. Having called for greater transparency in the past, we appreciate that the administration has listened to student demands for improved communication. We hope that this decision will set the tone for the administration’s future dealings, and that the legacy of these clandestine email searches will soon become a thing of the past.
On a less auspicious note, however, we remain disappointed that Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds has neither resigned nor apologized directly to the students of the College. Though the University is taking a step in the right direction in releasing Keating’s report, undergraduates have still not received sufficient indication from administrators that the release of the Keating report will be part of a larger effort to rebuild the trust that was lost in the debacle. At the very least, Hammonds should directly apologize to all members of the Harvard community, including the students of the College. We do recognize that she has worked to make amends with members of the faculty, but that ought to be a beginning to the process, not an end.
This has been a hard year for the Harvard community, with incessant, disappointing revelations about the cheating scandal and its investigation causing much concern on campus. With the release of this independent report, we hope that the University will begin the process of closure on the scandal. After a year of so much disheartening news, we hope that the community as a whole can begin the next school year having learned some valuable lessons about honesty, trust, and transparency.
Correction: May 1, 2013 
A previous version of this editorial stated that Dean Hammonds had not formally apologized to Harvard students. In fact, students were included in Hammonds' formal apology to the Harvard community.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Venezuela, the death of Hugo Chavez has caused the deterioration of a “sultanistic” regime, one in which state institutions become conflated with a single authoritarian leader. When this person on whom the state depends leaves power, the absence of sociopolitical norms independent of him become problematic as the political imperative based on the cult of his personality can no longer guide people. This is why Nicolás Maduro, Chavez’s handpicked successor, has tried so hard to legitimize himself as the new president of Venezuela and frequently renders himself a rebirth of his predecessor. But it isn't really carrying out Chavismo that Maduro is interested in so much as his own power, which is hard to hold on to in a society where power and Chavez had become inseparable. In the process of trying to legitimize himself as the proper president of Venezuela, Maduro has further damaged the country's already weak democratic norms and institutions. He must put an end to his counterproductive campaign for legitimacy for the sake of peace and democracy in Venezuela.
Maduro's disregard for democratic norms and institutions comes at time when Venezuelans need them respected and strengthened. As a first example, according to Article 233 of the Venezuelan Constitution, the President of the national assembly—in this case, Diasdado Cabello—is to become the interim president when the incumbent leaves office. Instead of respecting this clear-cut clause, Maduro decided to just become interim president anyway, and, with the backing of the country's foreign minister, ascended to the position, setting the precedent of unconstitutionality before his term even began.
This overt example of Maduro disrespecting Venezuelan democracy is accompanied by less explicit examples found in his public announcements. In a public broadcast April 16, Maduro had this message for TV station networks: “Decide who you are with: with the country and peace and the people, or are you going to go back to be with fascism?” The first problem with this provocative question posed to the media is that it implies that peace and backing Maduro are two sides of the same coin. He is effectively saying that not to politically support him is by nature subversive to peace. In addition to being plainly untrue, this assertion goes against the ideals of democracy in which people civilly disagree, negotiate, and compromise. Furthermore, reducing those who disagree with him to fascists amounts to nothing more than an ad hominem attack that turns reasoned political debate into a mudslinging contest.
But Maduro doesn't just rhetorically portray dissidents as subversive to peace; he also explicitly threatens to use violence against their peaceful demonstrations. The irony! For example, supporters of opposition candidate Henrique Capriles had planned a march to the National Electoral Council to protest the election results, and Maduro threatened to violently squash it. He specifically stated, “The march to the center of Caracas will not be permitted. I will use a hard hand against fascism and intolerance. I declare it. If they want to overthrow me, come and get me. Here I am, with the people and the armed forces.” His violent intolerance for people disagreeing with him shows he has no vested interest in peace. By prohibiting dissidence in his paranoia to keep the presidency, he's implied to the Venezuelan people that armed insurrection is the only effective way to disagree with him.
Moreover, by portraying and using the armed forces as a weapon against opposition, Maduro is again sacrificing one of the most necessary parts not just of democracy, but of any peaceful society by compromising the impartiality and non-interventionist stance the armed forces should have. Once a country's military starts taking sides in political conflicts, hope is lost for peaceful civil dissent.
In addition to undermining constructive conflict that accompanies democracy, these quotes demonstrate how Maduro is trying to strip political opponents of their humanity. He explicitly separates political dissidents from “the people” in his rhetoric. In this way, he parallels the conservative armed forces in many Latin American countries that dehumanizedtheir own citizens throughout the Cold War by rendering them “subversives” or “communists.” This justified the execution of hundreds of thousands of people who weren't directly supportive of the conservative military governments. In using similar tactics, Maduro proves no better than the military generals who left behind so much trauma in much of Latin America.
Maduro's assertion that he'll use a hard hand against “intolerance” is ironic beyond words and speaks volumes about his ability to reason through the hard decisions he'll have to make as president. It he fails to see that obviously fallacious logic, how can Venezuelans trust him to make reasoned decisions in the future? And more importantly, now that he is the president, he should use his huge base of vocal support to re-institutionalize the Venezuelan state. He must realize that compromising with people who disagree with him is the best way to keep his own presidency intact and establish stronger democratic norms in the country.

For a show filled with fire-breathing dragons and Machiavellian politics, Game of Thrones is surprisingly rich with economic metaphors that resemble the world we live in.
To start, although the Seven Kingdoms of the Westoros continent, where the saga unfolds, have the social and technological characteristics of medieval Europe, its economy ebbs and flows like the modern business cycle. Seasons on the continent lasts years. For an agrarian society, summer is like an economic boom and winter is like an economic depression. The grumpy old characters often deride the young ones as “summer children,” who have not experienced the hardship of a prolonged winter. The wise Northmen’s motto? Winter is coming.
And just like the fictional long winter, everyone knows that the economic depression is coming—but no one knows when. Prediction of seasons falls unto the shoulders of the “Maesters,” who literally live in high towers and study subjects like alchemy and history. This is not unlike modern economists, whose skills lie in concocting incentives in markets, but are given the task of predicting the unpredictable.
The economy of the Seven Kingdoms reached a sorry state during the show. A massive civil war broke out. The cost of standing armies and economic sanctions between warring kingdoms destroyed the feudal economy, leading to starvation and even more political unrest. The central government had to borrow large sums to cover its lost tax revenue and war expenses.
But the fate of the Seven Kingdoms was perhaps sealed before the show’s start. The continent was at the end of a long nine-year summer that followed an earlier civil war. Instead of ruling frugally, like his wise Northman friend Ned Stark suggested, King Robert lavished gold on dueling tournaments and hunting trips.
This is a narrative that Americans can relate to. From 1980 to 2005, technological advances and economic liberation around the globe made this era an incredible time for growth, a true “long summer” if there was one. However, just like the lavish king, the American federal government did not contain its spending problem, highlighted by costly programs such as expansion of Medicare with no long term feasibility. Local governments also piled up frivolous spending programs such as the 3 billion dollar sewer in Birmingham, Alabama and the 24 billion dollar tunnel in Boston.
In the show, King Robert ran a deficit every year when the time was good—because he could. His “Master of Coin,” Littlefinger, was a resourceful man who found a way to borrow gold at a good rate whenever the king wished. Real life politicians, whose re-election odds depend on the amount of favors they can pass out to constituents and donors, are also always pushing to spend more. Financial deregulation and globalization, combined with seemingly good credit ratings, make such borrowing incredibly cheap and easy for national and local governments. It should not be a surprise, then, that these very governments end up borrowing and spending more than they should in good times.
When wars broke out in the Seven Kingdoms, the king’s advisors faced the fiscal reality of owing a huge debt to a nepotic family, the Lannisters. The crown’s debt to the Lannisters forced it to concede political power by appointing Lannisters in important government posts. When a company faces bankruptcy, it often offers its creditor to swap debt for equity, giving them control in the company for delayed payment. When the Seven Kingdoms faces bankruptcy, the equivalent action is to cede political will to keep the interest rate low. As episodes in European debt-ridden countries, especially Cyprus, show, the large creditors of sovereign states already have political demands that could undermine the cause of democracy and good governance.
So what should the Seven Kingdoms have done? First, they should have cut back on projects that boost local economy in the short run, but do not lead to sustainable growth. Littlefinger, for example, encouraged King Robert to host more tournaments—pork barrel spending that keep his own brothel occupied during the event, but makes little economic sense for the kingdom. Instead, government spending should focus on common goods that are undersupplied by private markets. National defense programs such as The Wall, which guards all Seven Kingdoms against pillaging barbarians and ice zombies, were underfunded during King Robert’s rule. King Robert should also have made his spending counter-cyclical. He should be frugal in the good years to make sure that his kingdom can spend when he needs the money the most—during economic downturns.
But the roots of the Seven Kingdom’s problems are its myriad unchecked political and economic incentives. A politician like Littlefinger will make fiscal decisions to pamper to his sole constituent, King Robert, and to bring business to his brothel, at the cost of the economy. In real life, career politicianswill respond to special interests and their loudest constituents much more frequently than they do to the common good. When things take a bad turn, governments may lose fiscal autonomy as creditors like the Lannisters would start making fiscal decisions. Their rent-seeking behavior is disastrous for future good governance. The ideal fiscal decision maker should not spend to please, nor lend to gain power.
Perhaps there is a place for high tower alchemists and high-minded economists after all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“My dad said I didn’t have mental health, because I was smart.”
I listened as Bai continued to explain how her father had forbade her from seeking healthcare for mental illness. Bai was one of my interviewees for my thesis, which focused on Hmong-American young adults’ health views and healthcare decisions. As a pre-medical student, I was stunned to read about past conflicts between American clinicians and first-generation Hmong-American patients. My best friend in high school was Hmong-American, and I was concerned that she and others in the second generation might still face barriers to accessing healthcare. Considering Bai’s experience, I sought to disentangle what was specific to Hmong Americans from what might have much broader significance.
In the Hmong language, there is no medical word or phrase that means “mental illness.” Indeed, there is a general dearth of medical terminology. Before arriving in the U.S. as refugees from the Vietnam War, the Hmong lived agrarian lifestyles in the mountains of Laos. The Hmong understood health, illness, and healing in the context of a world inhabited and animated by spirits and believed that most illnesses and diseases were caused by the departure of a soul from one’s body. In these cases, a soul-calling ceremony would remedy the problem.
For Hmong-American young adults, “mental illness” is a new concept that can be alternately devastating and empowering. Without a direct translation in the Hmong language, “mental illness” is often explained in terms synonymous with “stupid.” Sometimes it’s described as “broken brain.”
Clearly, a diagnosis of mental illness can damage one’s self-concept. But as a label, “mental illness” also bears positive potential. A diagnosis can create hope for relief from symptoms and suffering, for the diagnosis constructs a disease that can be intellectually understood and medically treated. Bai sought care that helped her to recover, care that was not accessible or available in societies where “mental illness” was not recognized as a legitimate condition.
Yet, during my research I was troubled to recognize that most of my interviewees used “mental health” as synonymous with “mental illness.” Viewing these as synonyms prevents us from recognizing a central part of our health and wellbeing. With this view, we refrain from thinking of our own mental health unless we perceive a mental “problem.” We neglect to consider how declines in mental health lead to mental illness, which means that any one of us could be potentially affected.
The tragic suicides in 2012 forced me to confront these thoughts. I believed that increasing access to mental healthcare services on campus could help to alleviate suffering and prevent suicide.
I considered what it would take for me to access existing services. I would need to go to a room or building with peer supporters or healthcare providers, which would require that I first acknowledge or self-diagnose a problem; then research where to go, for what, when; and then make my way to a place I had never been before, where my very entrance would mark me as someone seeking help. I compared this to my typical “therapy”—text messaging a parent or a friend. I then considered the positive impact that simple pump-up text messages have on my own mental health, and I envisioned a new project: Crimson Community.
During the fall and winter, I met with Dr. Paul Barreira of University Health Services and past and present student leaders of the UC, Room 13, and Student Mental Health Liaisons in order to ensure that this app would serve students effectively and integrate with existing services. Over the J-term, I sent a proposal for the app to developer email lists at Harvard. My request outlined how Crimson Community would work, and what it aimed to do: strengthen the campus community and reduce barriers to accessing mental healthcare services. I wholly expected that I would get close to zero responses, since requests for developers are frequent and typically offer compensation. Still, within a day, seven developers had written back.
Since January 2013, I have been working with developers Ruth Fong ’15, Victoria Gu ’15, Stella Pantela ’15, and J. N. Fang ’16 to create the Crimson Community app. The web app will send a pump-up text message or email to each person enrolled in the Crimson Community once per week. Students enroll by texting or emailing the app. A different student group on campus writes the message each week, helping to build a unified and supportive community on campus.
Then, when a student seeks to access mental healthcare services, he or she can text back the app—the number is already stored on his or her phone—to get information about available services. A text with the words “eating disorder” will receive a text with information about how to access Eating Concerns Hotline and Outreach (ECHO), for instance. Other keywords are similarly matched to information about available services, often with a reference to a webpage on which to find information about additional resources.
With the app in its final stage of development, our team today remains small, but we hope that the app will soon help to build a Crimson Community on campus that crosses all barriers—including an often-imagined distinct line between general wellness and mental illness. We all have mental health. We are stronger when we listen to ourselves enough to recognize it. Together with our peers, let’s build a supportive campus community for all.

BOSTON—Campaign volunteers across the Commonwealth made thousands of last-minute phone calls on Tuesday afternoon, urging registered voters to turn out for the special election primary before the polls close at 8 p.m. Voters are choosing the two candidates who will face off in a June 25 special election to fill the U.S. Senate seat vacated when Secretary of State John F. Kerry was appointed to the Cabinet.
In the Republican race, public polls have showed former Navy SEAL Gabriel E. Gomez and former U.S. Attorney Michael J. Sullivan contending for the party’s nomination, with State Rep. Daniel B. Winslow in third. On Monday, though, officials with the Winslow campaign said that their internal polling showed the three men in a dead heat.
At Winslow’s downtown Boston headquarters on Tuesday afternoon, volunteers dialed frantically and kept receivers pressed to their ears, reminding supporters to make it to the polls and attempting to coax those on the fence to vote for Winslow.
“I was calling to see if you had a chance to vote today,” the refrain went, followed shortly by variations of “Any chance you voted for Dan Winslow?”
The frenzied phone drive was hardly a new scene at the campaign’s Milk Street headquarters, according to Winslow.
“The phones have been my campaign,” Winslow said in an interview on Tuesday afternoon. “We knew from the beginning that we weren’t going to be able to raise money like [Gomez], so we engaged in asymmetrical political warfare.... We targeted a very narrow bandwidth of people, Republicans and Independents, that we think will vote.”
The Gomez campaign took in more than three times as much money as the Winslow campaign, the Boston Globe reported. In this environment, Winslow Political Director Matthew Cocciardi said, the Winslow campaign had concentrated its limited resources on talking to likely voters either over the phone or in person, rather than on costly television advertising, which is harder to target.
“Essentially, we did a live touch of every voter who is going to be voting today and talked to them about Dan, where he stands on issues, and why they should support him,” Cocciardi said. “Gabriel Gomez went about it in a different way, with large ad buys, trying to target everybody and then trying to make sure they went and voted. We went right to the voters.”
Late Tuesday afternoon, Cocciardi said the strategy looked to be working. Though he predicted that turnout across the Commonwealth would come up short of expectations—Cocciardi estimated that only about 115,000 would vote in the Republican primary, while on Monday Massachusetts Secretary of State William F. Galvin anticipated as many as 200,000 voters—he said that reports from Winslow’s hometown of Norfolk, as well as surrounding areas, were encouraging.
“If you look at the numbers for us, Dan’s home district is coming out and voting,” Cocciardi said. adding that turnout also looked strong in Gomez’s hometown of Cohasset. In Plymouth, where Sullivan once served as district attorney, Cocciardi said it had been a slow morning, but that turnout had picked up in the afternoon.
“Right now, I think it’s anybody’s game,” Cocciardi said, noting that the Republican victor may not be known for hours after the polls close.

Part Three of a five-part series on Harvard's approaching capital campaign. Part One was published on April 29, Part Two on April 30, Part Four on May 2, and Part Five on May 3.
When Harvard’s capital campaign goes public later this year, the University is expected to formally unveil a handful of ambitious—and abstract—goals for which they will solicit billions of dollars in gifts.
But before there are publicized goals, there are private wishes, and every department, center, division, and school in Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences has them. From endowed professorships to new office space, the requests of each sub-group of the University’s flagship faculty are as diverse as the fields they study. Some needs, like financial aid, are obvious. Others are more obscure.
Yet as the campaign’s preparatory stages reach their conclusion after nearly a decade of off-and-on planning, campaign leaders are using the “quiet phase” to find the common threads that will weave specific wants into a more condensed list of objectives. Though those objectives should ultimately fit together seamlessly, faculty members involved in the planning process said the public vision of the campaign is the product of an arduous vetting process that aligns hundreds of potential priorities with prospective donors.
A broad initiative like teaching and learning, for example, is composed of hundreds of distinct pieces, such as endowed professorships, research grants, and scholarships for graduate students—and each requires financial support.
“Campaign planning should be in some sense a real extension of rigorous academic planning,” said William C. Kirby, the director of the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies and former Dean of FAS. The ideas that raise the most money, he added, start at the ground level and work their way up.
The process of filtering ideas from bottom to top varies slightly across FAS’ sub-groups.
At institutes and regional centers, directors work with faculty members and other affiliates to determine a center’s top priorities, which are presented as a “wish list” to current FAS Dean Michael D. Smith.
Ideas coming out of academic departments face a longer road. After being passed from faculty members to department chairs to one of three divisional deans, they finally make their way to Smith, who is responsible for synthesizing them into a holistic vision of FAS’ main priorities.
“[C]ampaign planning—particularly planning for academic priorities—occurs most fundamentally at the level of the three divisions, which have the best insight into departmental needs,” FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in a statement.
Once wish lists are submitted, however, the quiet phase becomes all but silent for departments and centers.
Although Neal said that Smith holds periodic meetings with department chairs from each academic division, as well as with center and institute heads, most sub-groups are now waiting for their proposals to be evaluated, said Andrew D. Gordon, history professor and a former director of the Edwin O. Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies.
Indeed, at this point much of the action has shifted behind closed doors as requests are shopped around to potential donors.
“Each center, either singularly or in conjunction, has put forward to the dean ideas, plans, things that we’d love to do that range from buildings to programs,” said Gordon. “And we’re sort of waiting to get green-lighted on them or not.”
Tamara E. Rogers ’74, vice president for alumni affairs and development, said that the quiet phase of any campaign is a period of “testing and marketing and analyzing results” to figure out what will be feasible when the campaign goes public.
“The quiet phase allows time to work with potential donors, see how they react to what we’re trying to do in the campaign,” Rogers said in an interview in mid-April. “If we get very affirmative reactions, and we’re able to raise money in this quiet phase up front, then it gives you a sense of how appealing the campaign is going to be.”
This shopping period can be one of the campaign’s most difficult aspects, according to regional center directors, but also one of its most important. With hundreds of ideas and deep-pocketed donors, trying to pair one with the other is a high-stakes game that ultimately helps campaign leaders outline broader themes and initiatives.
“You never want to raise money for things you don’t want to do,” Kirby said. More problematic can be naming priorities that donors will not support. Ideally such priorities are tweaked or eliminated during the vetting process, Gordon said.
Still, the vision developed through the vetting process is not set in stone.
As the campaign unfolds in real time, requests and expectations—particularly for smaller initiatives—can fluctuate a great deal. Rogers said that the current campaign will try to build in “unrestricted” funds to deal with that fluctuation. Those funds will not be tied to a specific initiative, allowing administrators the freedom to pursue new ideas not already articulated in the campaign.
“They’ve made a very good case for unrestricted giving,” Rogers said. “So that if you think of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Dean Smith has flexibility to try new things and to undertake initiatives or to fill in financial aid, for instance.”
While the planning process encourages campaign leaders to think ambitiously, it also gives departments and centers an opportunity to reframe their academic needs in terms of the bigger picture, Kirby explained.
“What are the needs of Harvard going ahead in the next 30 years?” he said. “Some of them are obvious—if you have a dorm falling apart and you need house renovations, then it’s an obvious thing to do. But what will be the next revolution of the life sciences? How do we have the capacity to invest in that?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the field of humanities seeks to assert its educational value and revive dwindling student interest, faculty and administrators from several universities gathered at the Knafel Gymnasium, formerly known as the Radcliffe Gymnasium, Tuesday afternoon to discuss the future of the humanities at Harvard and beyond.
The forum, entitled “The Humanities and the Future of the University,” featured panelists from the University of Cambridge, the University of California, Los Angeles, Columbia University, and Tufts University. The discussion was open to the public and streamed live on the Mahindra Humanities Center website.
Homi K. Bhabha, director of the Mahindra Humanities Center, opened the discussion by emphasizing that the forum was meant to foster dialogue rather than take a defensive position on the humanities.
“When I became the director of the Humanities Center, I vowed that we would never hold an event in which the word ‘crisis’ appeared alongside ‘the humanities’ in the title,” he said.
Bhabha did, however, acknowledge the difficulties facing the humanities today. According to Bhabha, the amount of money dedicated to humanities research in 2011 amounted to less than half of one percent of the amount dedicated to science and engineering research and development in the United States. This trend is consistent with other patterns in other countries, he added.
“The crisis is real, and it is global,” Bhabha said.
Following Bhabha’s remarks, each panelist discussed a series of pertinent themes and issues in the humanities disciplines, covering issues such as global communication, interdisciplinary collaboration, and the increasing influence of pre-professionalism.
According to Sheldon I. Pollock, a professor of South Asian Studies at Columbia, universities have endured a major shift in the past 15 years from “knowledge-producing to problem-solving.”
“For humanists, who don’t solve problems in the same way—in fact, we sometimes see our job as making problems by asking primary ontological questions—this context makes for a very steep uphill battle,” Pollock said.
Acknowledging the “tectonic shifts” that have been affecting the landscape of the humanities, Dean of Arts and Humanities Diana Sorensen turned the discussion to the state of the humanities at Harvard and introduced “The Humanities Project,” a report that analyzed trends in the liberal arts over the past several decades.
The product of a year-and-a-half long collaboration among Harvard humanities faculty, “The Humanities Project” will offer solutions on how to enrich and expand the community of humanities disciplines at Harvard when it is finally released.
University President Drew G. Faust offered closing remarks, explaining that she had commissioned this event in part so she could better understand the problems facing the humanities.
Faust said that the humanities are a vital foundation for any career path, but also stressing the value of pursuing the field “for non-instrumental reasons.”
“We must defend knowledge for its own sake,” said Faust.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Six years after embarking on a year-long roadtrip across America, Shane M. and Amy E. Bugbee set out on another—this time, to Harvard.
Partially funded by strangers on crowdsourced fundraising website www.gofundme.com, the married couple drove from Oregon to Cambridge in April to participate in several events at the Graduate School of Education this week.
Speaking before a small audience in Larsen Hall Tuesday evening, the Bugbees recounted how their first low-budget roadtrip across America helped turn their cynicism into optimism.
They said they decided to leave Ely, Minn. in 2007, after receiving death threats and anonymous letters falsely claiming they were satanists. Packing only $180, a dog, a turtle, a laptop, and a camera in their car, the disillusioned Bugbees embarked on their journey.
While on the road, the couple filmed a series of video interviews mostly with strangers they met in their travels. In those interviews, the Bugbees asked their subjects questions about politics, art, religion, and revolution, and also queried their subjects about what they believed to be the best and worst things about America. In keeping with his cynical outlook at that time, Shane said he had originally intended to only use footage about the worst elements of American life. But by the end of the journey, he decided to use both.
“[After leaving Ely] we saw people and humanity as horrible, and when we went on our trip we found out that people are very decent,” Shane said.
That footage was ultimately turned into a full-length movie and e-book entitled “The Suffering and Celebration of Life in America,” which The Bugbees said capture Shane’s journey to rediscovering the kindness of humanity.
One night, the Bugbees recalled, strangers at a gas station in a crime-ridden area worked together to point a disoriented Shane in the right direction.
In their talk Tuesday, the Bugbees also showed clips of footage from their film that ranged from the shocking to the profound. In one clip, a man says to the camera, “No one’s got the balls to set off a dirty bomb in the Mall of America, so what do you do? You kidnap people, cut their heads off, videotape it, and put it up on YouTube. That’s the new form of protest.”
In another, an interviewee draws an analogy between athletics and art to suggest that every person can be an artist.
Just as all people can be athletes in the right sport for them, he says, “anyone can be an artist provided they find the right art form.”
The Bugbees were invited to the School of Education by the newly formed Cultural Studies Club.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood addressed student concerns Tuesday night about the possible cancellation of a popular adaptive leadership course, but did not commit to maintaining practical leadership training in the Kennedy School’s curriculum.
Speaking to a crowd of students at a Kennedy School Student Government meeting, Ellwood did not comply with demands from the KSSG that he and other Kennedy School administrators pledge their commitment to two courses—Management, Leadership, and Decision Sciences 201: “Exercising Leadership: The Politics of Change” and MLD 202: “Exercising Leadership: A Cross-Cultural & International Perspective.” Students said they fear that a Kennedy School faculty committee’s recent decision not to promote one of two adaptive leadership lecturers, Dean Williams, to the post of senior lecturer may spell the end of MLD 202.
Ellwood acknowledged this potential outcome, saying “There is a possibility that [MLD] 202 will not be taught.”
Ellwood attended the meeting in response to an email sent by the KSSG to the Kennedy School community last Friday laying out demands and requesting his presence on Tuesday.
Attendees cited other pieces of evidence to support their perception of a decline of institutional support for adaptive leadership at the Kennedy School. In the past, one adaptive leadership module—a half-semester introductory course—was mandatory for Kennedy School students, said Stephen J. Frost, a Kennedy School alumnnus and current visiting fellow. This requirement has since been dropped.
When asked about this change, Ellwood said, “I don’t remember what the core was back [then].”
Ellwood said that experiential learning was a “huge priority” for the school, but offered no specific plan to ease student concerns about the curriculum.
Currently, there are two lecturers in adaptive leadership at the Kennedy School. Both teach one section each of MLD 201, which is consistently rated by alumni as the most influential course at the Kennedy School. Williams is currently the sole teacher of MLD 202, the school’s only other adaptive leadership course.
Although he did not receive promotion, Williams was granted a one-year part-time contract to remain at the Kennedy School for the coming academic year. This is an extension to a two-time, three-year lecturer contract which is part of a system Ellwood characterized as “up or out.” Under this policy, lecturers typically leave the school after three or six years or, if they are promoted, stay on board as a senior lecturer.
As part of his new part-time contract, Williams can only teach one course next year. Administrators have yet to determine whether Williams will continue to teach 201—effecting an end to 202—or continue to teach 202 while lecturer Ronald Heifetz carries on with the only section of 201.
Ellwood said he will meet with Heifetz to discuss the prospect of replacing Williams, a conversation which KSSG President Rohit Malhotra said must be followed by another discussion with students.
The decision not to promote Williams, Ellwood said, does not reflect a financial constraint, but instead a confidential faculty opinion about personnel.
When students urged Ellwood to name an action they could take to retroactively influence the decision, Ellwood said, “there’s really very little you can do.”
When the KSSG met last week, they agreed to send the open email and discussed the possibility of targeting capital campaign fundraising and bringing the issue to the national media. There was no discussion of these tactics at Tuesday’s meeting.

In an indication that the student-led movement to reform mental health resources may be losing steam, Harvard University Health Services postponed the release of mental health survey results after zero students showed up to either of its two public presentations in the last week.
“The goal will be to hold the event in the fall when a larger community conversation can be held,” Director of Harvard University Health Services Paul J. Barreira said Tuesday night in front of an empty Emerson lecture hall.
Invitations to both events were sent to Resident Deans, House email lists, and peer counseling groups, according to Barreira.
The cancellation of Tuesday night’s mental health-focused event comes just four days after UHS announced the rescheduling of a Friday afternoon presentation on alcohol and sexual health given that no student attended.
According to UC President Tara Raghuveer ’14, the Council plans to continue the undergraduate mental health discussion on its own by reviewing and discussing the survey results with Barreira.
“I do not believe that movement to reform mental health has lost energy,” Raghuveer wrote in an email. “Students are still confused about the intersection of College policies...and mental health.”
Despite the poor turnout, Barreira said UHS plans to make recent mental health survey results available online once the community has had a chance to discuss the results and ask questions in an open forum.
UHS’s decision to host Tuesday’s panel comes at the end of a semester in which Harvard’s mental health services have come under increased scrutiny.
The group that originally led that charge, the Coalition to Reform Mental Health Services at Harvard, is an activist group that aims to “bring together those on Harvard’s campus who support improving mental health response in the Harvard community,” according to the group’s Facebook description.
Formed in response to an anonymous Crimson op-ed that prompted more than 150 students and members of the Undergraduate Council to rally outside Massachusetts Hall, the Coalition quickly amassed over 300 members. In late February, the UC unanimously passed a bill pledging to listen to the Coalition’s concerns and provide it with “opportunities to engage with administrators.” Toward the middle of the semester, students and members of the UC said they felt undergraduates had finally produced a sustainable dialogue on the College’s handling of mental health cases.
Despite initial enthusiasm, however, no public activism efforts have occurred since February’s rally, and emails from The Crimson to Coalition organizers requesting information about recent activism efforts have gone unanswered.

Eight members of the Harvard community received recognition for their commitment to teaching and mentorship at the annual Teaching and Advising Awards Dinner held Tuesday evening in Kirkland Dining Hall.
Co-hosted by the Undergraduate Council and the Advising Programs Office, the event was filled with emotion as the small group of award recipients was announced from a pool of 133 nominations from undergraduates.
“We worked with the entire UC to publicize the nomination process over house lists,” said UC Education Committee Vice-Chair Florence Y. Chen ’15. “We wanted to get as many nominations as we could for people who inspired students—changing their academic trajectories and changing their lives.”
The John R. Marquand Awards for Exceptional Advising and Counseling of Harvard Students were granted to Kirkland House Tutor Scott Poulson-Bryant, Expository Writing Preceptor Jane Unrue, and Assistant Director of Undergraduate Studies in Human Evolutionary Biology Carole K. Hooven.
“Shout-out to the students who nominated their advisors,” said APO Program Manager Brooks B. Lambert-Sluder ’05. “It’s one thing to appreciate what advisors have done for you, and another thing entirely to sit down and take the time to share those stories with others.”
Peer Advising Fellow Megan B. Prasad ’15, a Crimson magazine writer, was nominated for an award by six students, several of whom named their blocking group TheMeganPrasadFanClub in her honor.
“If the [PAF] Program was designed to provide students with nurturing mentors and to create an awesome and supportive environment, then Megan is definitely one of the reasons why the program is such a massive success,” said James D. Dana ’16, one of Prasad’s mentees.
Theodore D. Lederhausen ’14, the other PAF who was honored with an award, also received multiple nominations.
“One of the students who nominated him said she wanted to become a PAF because of him, and that if one day, she could make a fraction of the impact that he made on her on a freshman, then she would consider herself successful,” said Lambert-Sluder before handing Lederhausen his award.
The Joseph R. Levenson Memorial Teaching Prizes for exceptional undergraduate teaching were awarded to Statistics professor David P. Harrington, History and Literature lecturer Suzanne E. Smith, and Mathematics teaching fellow Gabriel Bujokas.
“Sometimes faculty members—advisors in particular—are underappreciated,” said UC Education Committee Chair Darragh Nolan ’15. “It’s nice to show that we care.”

Sending text messages and making phone calls, a handful Harvard students sought to get out the vote for a U.S. Senate primary election that generated relatively little enthusiasm among political activists on campus.
Fifteen student members of the Harvard College Democrats gathered in the sparsely decorated Canaday Common Room Tuesday morning to canvass for U.S. Rep. Edward J. Markey, who ultimately defeated Rep. Stephen F. Lynch in the Democratic Senate primary. Working the phones from 9 a.m. until 1:30 p.m., they urged College students registered to vote in Massachusetts to head to the polls.
Despite their enthusiasm, it was a remarkably different scene than similar efforts last fall, when Harvard students mobilized to support former Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren in her successful bid for the U.S. Senate.
“A lot of people have election fatigue. It’s been lower excitement in general,” said Daniel E. Backman ’15, one of the Canaday canvassers.
Originally, Backman said, the Dems’ Harvard for Ed Markey group reached out to more than 100 students to help with the campaign after the Dems endorsed Markey in February. But only a few responded.
Even with enthusiasm low among both activists and voters, Backman said the Dems still saw the election as an important one.
“With the whole country looking at this race as a judgment on Obama’s term so far and the Democrats in Congress as well,” said Backman. “We decided that we couldn’t let a Republican win again.”
In addition to their efforts on the morning of election day, the Harvard for Ed Markey group also went door-to-door last weekend to remind registered students to vote and assisted Markey’s campaign office in Central Square on Tuesday afternoon. The group was also aided by students affiliated with Divest Harvard in phonebanking and registration efforts. The Dems also co-hosted a voter registration event with the Institute of Politics, the Harvard Republican Club, and the Undergraduate Council Monday night.
For its part, the Republican Club held no organized events on election day. Following the organization’s tradition, it did not endorse any of the three Republican candidates in the primary, instead encouraging individuals or sub-groups to devote their efforts to the campaign of their choice.
According to Republican Club publicist Aaron I. Henricks ’16, some club members supported eventual Republican primary winner Gabriel E. Gomez “by word-of-mouth and emails.”
One Republican Club member, Sarah R. Siskind ’14, campaigned extensively for losing candidate and State Rep. Daniel B. Winslow.
“Normally I’m not very active in local elections, but I’ve been really active in this one,” she said.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: May 7, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the number of students who gathered in Canaday Common Room on the morning of the primary election to make phone calls and send text messages for U.S. Rep. Edward J. Markey, the eventual victor of the election. In fact, 15 students, not four, made calls and sent text messages in Canaday that day.

Despite low voter turnout across the state, participation at the polls in Quincy House was higher than expected Tuesday, as undergraduates and other members of the community cast their ballots in the first step towards filling the congressional seat vacated by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry.
Despite the low profile of the primaries for the Senate special election, nearly 40 people had come to cast their vote by mid-afternoon—an unusually high turnout, according to poll worker Dawn M. Adolphe.
Nancy R. Aiguier, who has staffed the polls at Quincy House in the past, indicated surprise over the number of voters.
“I wasn’t expecting it to be like this,” Aiguier said. “I thought it was going to be very quiet, and I didn’t see it as a big election.”
The strong turnout at Quincy was lack of publicity surrounding the election. While the Warren-Brown race this past fall drew over 3 million voters to the polls, approximately 550,000 and 200,000 voted in the Democratic and Republican primaries, respectively.
Still, many students told The Crimson they were enthusiastic about participating in the electoral process.
Elena F. Hoffenberg ’16, who said she “definitely” would be voting, cited the lack of attention surrounding the election as her primary reason to participate.
“Sometimes a vote cast in a smaller election can be more decisive than one cast in a presidential election or in an off-year,” Hoffenberg said. “It gives me a special opportunity for me to really have a voice in politics.”
Other students who voted had cited more obvious reasons for their excitement. “I enjoy being a part of the democratic process,” Chad J. Benoit ’16 said.
Not all students approached by The Crimson were as enthusiastic, however—in fact, many were unaware of Tuesday’s primary elections, or were unsure of where they could vote.
Even upon learning of the polling location, Lauren B. Feldman ’13 said she was still uncertain about voting.
“I’d feel better about myself if I did,” she said.
Although recent media coverage of the Boston bombings has diverted attention from the ongoing Senate race, the Quincy poll workers suggested that the tragedy could actually have inspired increased voter participation on campus.
“Maybe that’s causing them to say no matter what’s going on, I’m gonna come out and vote,” said Alguier, who added that political participation in the wake of the crisis could be an empowering action.
Adolphe echoed the idea that the bombings could be a rallying call.
“[People] want to feel like they have more control over what’s going on,” she said. “Voting is a part of that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The following is play-by-play from the Harvard baseball team's April 29 game against Boston College at Fenway Park. The contest was the last of the Crimson's 2013 spring campaign, a number of Red Sox players "joined in" on the action (see the third inning), and all three Harvard seniors saw playing time.
It's a beautiful day for baseball here at Fenway Park at the Beanpot consolation game. The Harvard baseball team takes on Boston College, with the Crimson (10-31, 7-13 Ivy) representing the home team in the first base dugout. The two squads met earlier this season in Chestnut Hill on April 3, and the Eagles (9-35, 2-21 ACC) stole a tight 8-6 victory.
1st Inning:
After both teams line up for the national anthem, Harvard runs out into the field, with sophomore Matt Timoney on the bump. On a 2-2 pitch, Timoney strikes out the first batter of the game on the outside corner. After an HBP, the Boston College three hitter lines a single into left. With runners on first and third and no outs, Timoney gets the cleanup hitter to go down swinging on a curveball in the dirt. An unearned run crosses the plate as sophomore Tanner Anderson cannot handle a bouncing ball at second base. With two outs and a full count, Timoney walks the batter to load the bases. After falling behind 2-0, Timoney gets to two strikes and forces a pop out to first base in foul territory.
Junior LHP Steve Green takes the mound for Boston College. Junior left fielder Carlton Bailey leads off for the Crimson and rips a line drive right at the shortstop for the first out. Sophomore Mike Martin follows him up with a soft line drive to second base for out number two. Sophomore right fielder Brandon Kregel grounds out to shortstop for the third out of the inning.
After 1: BC 1, Harvard 0
In the top of the second, Timoney bounds off the mound to field a weak tapper and fires to first for the first out. After a Joe Cronin single and a hit batter, Blake Butera flies out to freshman Matt Sanders in center. With two outs, the Boston College third hitter lines a ball to first base, and sophomore Nick Saathoff makes a nice leaping grab to retire the side.
Anderson strikes out looking to begin the top of the second on a borderline pitch on the outside part of the plate. Freshman Mitch Klug makes the second out on a hard ground ball right at the third baseman. Saathoff gives Harvard its first baserunner of the game by drawing a walk on a 3-1 count. Freshman Dj Link hits a Texas leaguer into right center and the BC center fielder makes a shoestring catch.
After 2: BC 1, Harvard 0
The weather could not be any more perfect, with sunshine and a light breeze contributing to an awesome day for baseball. Timoney returns to the mound for the top of the third. After a walk, a pop out, and a groundout, Dowdell lines an RBI single to left before a groundout to Anderson at second ends the threat.
During the top of the third, as live play was going on, several members of the Red Sox ventured into right field and began tossing back and forth on the warning track. A few Harvard players turned around to briefly watch the action, which expanded to as many as five players and at one point included Boston outfielder Shane Victorino.The Crimson later learned that Red Sox officials had asked both coaches before the game whether this would be alright with their respective teams.
Sanders begins the inning with a groundout to shortstop. Ranging to his left, the BC second baseman makes a nifty pickup to retire the second batter. Bailey gets the Crimson its first hit of the game with a bounder back up the middle. Martin follows him up with a single to right, and Bailey advances to third on the play. But Green forces Kregel to pop out to third base to end the two-out rally.
After 3: BC 2, Harvard 0
Cronin lines a base hit to center for his second knock of the game to start of the fourth. Martin makes a beautiful, leaping over-the-shoulder catch on a blooper into left field for the first out. After a hit puts runners on first and second, Timoney throws the ball into center field as no one covers second on a pickoff attempt and the runner advances to third. John Hennesey hits a single through the hole on the right side to score a run. With runners on first and third, Timoney forces a ground ball for a 6-4-3 double play, aided by a nice scoop by Saathoff at first base to help hold off the BC rally.
Anderson goes down looking on a curveball that scrapes the black on the outside. Klug notches the first extra base hit of the game, ripping the first pitch he sees over the head of the left fielder, and scooting into second base as the ball takes a one-hop of the monster. Saathoff flies out to center field for the second out. Link rips a single back through the box, and the throw from center field is off as fellow freshman Klug races home to score Harvard's first run of the game. Sanders softy lines out to second base to end the inning.
After 4: BC 3, Harvard 1
Junior Peter Kaplan replaces Timoney to start of the fifth. Kaplan forces a groundout, and Sanders makes a nice running catch on a ball that nearly takes him back to the triangle in deep right center field. Kaplan temporarily loses his control, walking three straight batters to load the bases, but he maintains his composure and gets a strikeout to escape with zero runs allowed.
Freshman Sean O'Neill strikes out swinging, and Bailey makes the second out by popping out in foul territory. Martin legs out an infield single on a grounder to shortstop to bring Kregel to the plate. Martin swipes second base to move into scoring position, but the umpire rings up Kregel on a 3-2 pitch to end the inning.
After 5: BC 3, Harvard 1
Kaplan plunks the first batter, forces a fly ball, and then hits one more. A called third strike records the second out of the inning. But a fly ball down the right field line falls as Kregel has trouble around the right field foul line, and two runs score on the play (the foul line runs up against the wall in right field at Fenway). Kaplan strikes out the next batter for the third out.
John Nicklas in to pitch for the Eagles. With Harvard down four runs entering the bottom of the sixth, Anderson can't get the inning started and strikes out swinging. Klug hits the ball hard for the third time, but the BC third baseman makes a leaping catch on a live drive, robbing the freshman of a hit down the line. Saathoff draws a two out walk, but Link lines out to left field.
After 6: BC 5, Harvard 1
The Eagles catcher rips a double down the left field line off Kaplan to begin the seventh. Cronin fails to lay down a sacrifice bunt and strikes out looking. After a walk, Harvard head coach Bill Decker opts for freshman Sean Poppen from the bullpen to replace Kaplan. Poppen throws his first pitch into the dirt as the runners move up to second and third, and a sacrifice fly to Kregel in right brings home BC's sixth run of the game. With two outs, Dj Link makes a beautiful throw to second base to backpick the runner who was too aggressive in his secondary lead.
The shadows have crept up above home plate, likely making offense much more difficult to come by in the later innings. Sanders grounds out to third base, and O'Neill flies out to right. Carlton Bailey dribbles a tapper down the third base line, as good as a bunt, for an infield single. Martin rips another line drive, but it goes directly to the left fielder to end the inning.
After 7: BC 6, Harvard 1
Senior Jordan Haviland enters the game for Harvard in the top of the eighth. An error by Klug at third base allows Hennessy to reach base, and he takes second on a steal. Haviland fans the next batter on a full count, and Link guns down Hennessy at third on a stolen base attempt. A flyout to right field ends the top of the frame.
Harvard gets off to a fast start in the bottom of the eighth after Kregel draws a walk and Anderson is hit by a pitch. Klug hits another ball hard, but it goes to the left fielder for an out. Saathoff pops up to shortstop for the second out, and Link grounds into a fielder's choice to second base.
After 8: BC 6, Harvard 1
Senior Matt Doyle, who has been coping with a leg injury for the majority of the season, enters the game to pitch the final defensive half inning of the season for the Crimson. Doyle walks the first batter on four straight pitches, and a steal followed by a groundout puts a runner on third with one out. Doyle throws a wild pitch, plating the Eagles' seventh run of the game. Doyle gets two of the next three hitters to strike out, both on 1-2 counts, to prevent further damage.
Nate Bayuk enters to pitch for BC. To begin the bottom of the ninth, freshman Michael Loughlin pinch hit for Sanders but struck out after falling behind, 0-2. Freshman T.J. Laurisch also enters as a pinch hitter and gets himself on base with a single up the middle. At this point, senior Rob Wineski, having suffered a broken jaw during batting practice just over a week ago, enters to pinch run for Laurisch. Wineski is on the field for one pitch before he is replaced by another pinch runner in junior Sam Dodge, and the senior exits to the applause of his teammates and the fans behind the dugout. Bailey lines a single to right center field to put men on first and second with one out, and Martin walks to load the bases. Kregel falls behind 0-2 before he lifts a fly ball to center field for the RBI. Down to its last out of the season, Anderson hits a ground ball to the shortstop who throws to first to end the game.
Final score: BC 7, Harvard 2. Both teams amass eight hits, but the Crimson commit four errors to BC's zero.

The Harvard men’s tennis team is officially going dancing. On Tuesday evening, the 2013 NCAA Men’s Tournament bracket was finalized, and the Ivy League champion Crimson was selected to face No. 75 Samford in the first round.
No. 21 Harvard (18-5, 6-1 Ivy) will travel to Starkville, Miss. to the campus of Mississippi State University to take on the Bulldogs (15-9, 7-3 Southern Conference) on May 10. The Crimson qualified for the tournament for the second straight season after compiling a 6-1 conference record en route to its second consecutive Ivy title.
The Crimson officially earned its 21st overall appearance in the tournament on Saturday, when it claimed the Ivy title outright with a 6-1 win over Dartmouth in Hanover.
Last year, Harvard advanced to the second round of the NCAA tournament, falling to Florida after defeating Virginia Tech in the first round.
Although the Crimson and the Bulldogs have never faced each other before, they do have one common opponent this season: Alabama. Harvard fell to the Crimson Tide, 4-1, on Feb. 1st, but Samford squeezed by them, 4-3, less than a week later.
The Crimson knows that it cannot take the Bulldogs lightly, despite their lower ranking, according to head coach Dave Fish.
“Their national ranking is lower because they haven’t played as tough a schedule as we have, but they are formidable,” he said. “Our impression of them is very strong. Alabama’s top two players beat our guys, but the Samford guys beat them. So it’ll be a very close match.”
The team thinks that its experience from last year will help it prepare for tournament play.
“Fortunately, four of our starters have gone through this before,” Fish said. “This is nothing we haven’t faced before. Our guys will be focused both to get work done for their upcoming exams and to prepare for our matches.”
Harvard’s holds a 14-21 overall record in tournament matches, and its best finish is its quarterfinal appearance in 1997. But the Crimson is not thinking that far ahead, and instead has a more focused set of goals.
“Everyone has the goal of getting to the first round matches and seeing if they can win two,” Fish said. “If we can do that, we make it to the Round of 16 at the University of Illinois, which is the big show.”
To get to Illinois, Harvard will first have to make it past the Bulldogs and then the host Mississippi State Bulldogs, whom it would face on May 11th.
“It’ll be tough, but very exciting and a nice championship experience,” Fish said. “But it’s a zero sum game. If you lose in the first round, you go home.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 2013 Harvard men’s lacrosse team seemed to finish right where it had started.
A year ago, the Crimson concluded its 2012 season just outside the Ivy League postseason picture with a 10-8 loss to Yale and a 6-8 overall, 2-4 in-conference record. This Saturday, the 2013 Crimson finished in similar fashion, losing to Yale, 11-10, to leave the field with an identical 6-8 overall, 2-4 in-conference record. The results suggest that the Crimson maintained the status quo this season after a disappointing 2012 campaign.
But a closer look reveals the opposite. While last year’s Harvard men’s lacrosse team may have underachieved, this year’s squad almost overachieved. The Crimson came within a goal or two of breaking through in big ways this year, despite internal challenges and external obstacles.
In 2012, Harvard returned 10 of 11 starters to enter February as Inside Lacrosse Magazine’s preseason No. 11. The 2013 Crimson, in contrast, had to meet the challenge of several big-name departures, both expected and unexpected. Most notably, Harvard lost all-time career scoring leader Jeff Cohen to graduation, and the team had to adjust to the absence of its second-highest scorer, junior attackman Danny Eipp, who suffered a torn ACL midway through the season.
Yet Sophomore midfielder Murphy Vandervelde and junior attackman Peter Schwartz elevated their games in Eipp’s absence, and highly-touted freshman Devin Dwyer commanded the attack from the X with Siyani Chambers-esque maturity. With the impending return of Eipp and others, Harvard should be optimistic about its offensive prospects next year.
The Crimson also had to jockey for position in an enhanced Ivy League. The conference finally lived up to the hype of its recruiting classes this year. At the end of the regular season, the Ivy League still placed four teams in the national top-20, and Harvard would have likely joined them with a win over the Bulldogs on Saturday. There were four games this season that Harvard would probably like to have back: an 11-9 loss at Brown on Mar. 16, a 12-11 loss versus No. 12/10 Duke on Mar. 30, a 14-12 loss versus No. 2 Cornell on Apr. 6, and the 11-10 loss to No. 15 Yale on Saturday.
In each of those games, the Crimson outplayed its opponent for long stretches. In the first three of these games, Harvard led by multiple goals in the second half. Against Yale, the Crimson forced Bulldog goalkeeper Eric Natale to make two saves in the final half minute to prevent overtime.
Trade a hit pipe for a goal and an unforced turnover for a caught ball in any one of these games and Harvard’s year changes dramatically. The brevity of the Crimson’s 14-game season magnified each missed shot and misplayed ball in these close games. I know that it can be foolish to play the “what if” game when evaluating a season, but the Harvard-Yale game in particular leant itself to such speculation.
What if Dwyer had buried that shot at the top of the crease? What if Schwartz had caught that ball? What if Natale’s leg hadn’t blocked Mumford’s shot? What if the Crimson hadn’t taken six penalties?
I’m sure that at least a couple of these questions entered the minds of Harvard players as they walked off the field Saturday.
Lacrosse is a game of details. In the end, those details sunk a Crimson squad that struggled to put together a perfect game. But Harvard’s performances against Cornell, Yale, and Duke were arguably better than the performances of its supposedly stronger 2012 roster.
Despite the graduations of leading goal-scorer Alex White, captain Jason Gonos, and starting goalkeeper Harry Krieger, Harvard’s young core will come back next year more experienced and better prepared to challenge for an Ivy League title. That experience will come in handy in the tight, late-game situations that were often the Crimson’s undoing this season.
The Harvard men’s lacrosse team may have finished its season on a losing streak, but it nevertheless proved that it could compete with the nation’s best on a consistent basis. The weakened squad was expected to take a step back this year. Instead, the Crimson just may have taken a step forward.
In interviews before and after Harvard-Yale, Gonos emphasized that the team’s work ethic and chemistry separated itself from past years’ squads.
“This is the closest team I’ve been on,” Gonos said after the game. “We consider ourselves a family. And you get that by how hard we worked, and we worked harder than we ever have before.”
Add those elements to an increased level of talent and experience next year, and you’ve got a winning combination.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard baseball team had a number of strikes against it before the season even started.
The team was coming off a 12-30 record in a 2012 campaign in which it won only one of its first 17 games. In late July, beloved head coach Joe Walsh passed away and the squad was leaderless for the first time since 1996.
Perhaps most significantly, the Crimson essentially started from the bottom of the pack as it lost most of its top talent in the offseason. Six of the team’s top nine hitters were absent from its roster, and the players that remained accounted for less than 30 percent of last year’s hit total. The losses extended over to the pitching side as well, as two of the squad’s top hurlers departed.
As of late February, it looked as if the season might have been worse than a rebuilding year, as the majority of players were relatively unproven.
But the Crimson must have thought differently. Looking back on the season, there is little doubt that the team exceeded expectations—things are certainly looking up for the Harvard baseball program.
The Crimson won ten times on the year, a one game improvement from the 2011 season and just two fewer wins than last year. It posted a 7-13 record in Ivy League play, only dropping two of its seven series. Seven of those 13 losses were decided by three runs or fewer.
It is true that Harvard lost 14 straight games after winning its first contest of the season. But in the duration of that losing streak, the squad faced off against some of the best talent in the country. In addition, eight of those losses came in a relentless Texas spring break trip in which the team played 10 games in as many days.
At times, the offense came alive and was tough to stop, including in a 20-19 victory over Princeton and a 12-10 win over Brown. The Crimson repeatedly demonstrated its grit, most notably by winning twice in extra innings, first in walk off fashion against Bucknell and later in a 4-2 nail biter over the Bears.
But most importantly, players banded together in the face of adversity and attempted to make the best of their circumstances. According to coach Bill Decker, this is what matters most—especially considering the tumultuous state of the program he inherited in October.
“I’ve been doing this a long time, and this group of kids gave a pretty good darn effort day in and day out,” Decker said. “We certainly had a few bumps in the road, but I don’t think that this year should be measured by wins and losses alone…. What makes it special is that you have guys that can give to one another and understand that I’m working for you and you’re working for him. That’s what it’s all about.”
Decker understands that the team in its current condition was not built to win an Ivy League title. Indeed, what will ultimately be the season’s greatest takeaway was the chance for many underclassmen to get extensive playing time.
This year, the Crimson had only three seniors. Co-captain Rob Wineski ranked ninth on the squad in batting average, fellow co-captain Jordan Haviland pitched fewer innings than six other hurlers, and senior Matt Doyle dealt with a leg injury that sidelined him for most of the second half of the season.
While the seniors provided invaluable leadership, it was the younger guys who carried the majority of the weight throughout the year. In the final game of the season, eight of the nine starters were either freshmen or sophomores. The remaining starter was a junior.
Three of the ball club’s key players this season were sophomores. Outfielder Brandon Kregel led the team with a .288 batting average and 14 RBIs. Utility man Mike Martin overcame an early season injury to hit .287 with 12 extra base hits. Tanner Anderson was a workhorse all year, ranking third in innings pitched and fourth with a .261 average at the plate.
The freshman class demonstrated similar promise. Sean Poppen became a reliable weekend starter, DJ Link caught every game down the stretch and ranked third on the team in hits, and infielder Mitch Klug finished right behind him with 33 knocks. Each will undoubtedly make large contributions going forward.
In a normal season, many of these players would not have seen nearly as much action. But the team will have a very good idea of its identity going into next year, which could not have been further from the case this season.
Decker was right. Don’t judge this year’s Harvard baseball team by its record. The Crimson will come back a good deal stronger next year, and even more so the year after that. You might be surprised by the results.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students are innately busy people. Whether it is involvement in research or drama or a varsity sport, students at the College invariably have numerous commitments. Many students play varsity sports, committing seasons or years to one game or race they love.
For a few Harvard students, though, one sport is not enough. A select few multi-sport athletes, like senior Aisha Price, who plays water polo and soccer, and junior Damani Wilson, who plays football and runs track, have chosen to juggle their time and extend their talents to two arenas.
They would have it no other way.
“It is all I have ever known,” Wilson says. “From the time I was nine years old, track season was football’s offseason and vice versa.”
Even though Harvard sports can fly under the national radar, every sport competes at or near the highest level, often playing the top schools across the country.
Most sports require commitments on six, even seven days a week throughout their seasons. In addition, athletes train multiple times per week through the offseason, with some days requiring multiple training sessions.
“Sometimes I end up making three trips across the river in a single day,” Wilson says. “During the week things can get really hectic sometimes when you combine two sports with my academic responsibilities. ”
In order to compete in two sports, these athletes must give up on the offseason time, sometimes jumping right into the next season.
“Soccer is in the fall and water polo is in the spring,” Price says. “I have that winter season to train for water polo again. Then in the summer I prepare for soccer.”
Certain sports, such as girl’s lacrosse and field hockey, are conducive to dual athletes. Junior Jen Hatfield currently plays goalie on both squads.
Track and field, a year-round sport, has multiple dual-sport athletes other than Wilson. Junior Andrew Ezekoye is also a member of the track and football teams.  One of their teammates, junior Connor McCarthy, is also a forward on the soccer team.
While players like Price enjoy a few months of offseason prep, other two-sporters have no lag time at all. Wilson, for example, jumps right from football into track, a year-long commitment.
Conflicts sometimes arise when the sports are training simultaneously, as athletes must decide where to devote their limited time.
“I committed to Harvard to be a football player only, so when there is a conflict between the two I make sure to be at all football events,” Wilson says. “The coaches of both programs are clear and understanding about this.”
Wilson’s decision to join the track team did not come until his sophomore year.
“[Coming out of high school] I was open to doing either sport or even both in college but I assumed that at one point I would specialize in only one sport,” Wilson says. “When I committed to Harvard, I had only been in contact with the football program so I came in as a football player only. But after my sophomore football season, I had a few conversations with different coaches and it was eventually decided that participating in track was an opportunity I would be able to pursue. Shortly after that I decided to join the track team.”
The journey to being a two-sport athlete at Harvard is different for each athlete. While Wilson came to Harvard exclusively as a football player, Price arrived on campus with the intention of playing both water polo and soccer.
“Soccer recruiting begins early, so I got a likely to Harvard for that,” Price says. “Then I talked to the water polo coach and she wanted me as well. It’s only at Ivy League schools that you have the potential to do both.”
Both athletes pointed to their coaches as integral parts of their success.
“It was only having great coaches here at Harvard that allowed me to do this,”  Price says.
For all the challenges, both Price and Wilson seem to agree that the crowded schedules have been well worth it. Price, who is in the midst of her final season as a Crimson athlete, fondly talks of the overlapping friendships on both teams.
“I think one thing that is nice is that the soccer team will support the water polo events and (vice versa),” Price says. “It is nice that both of them have been able to become friends.”
“The only time I ever was hesitant or skeptical about my decision to play two sports was during the decision-making process,” Wilson says. “Once I decided to join the track team, I never looked back. I would never give up the friendships Harvard football has afforded me.”
Not only are the student-athletes happy, but they have also succeeded at both sports. Price was a contributor throughout her career for the women’s soccer team. This spring, she is a co-captain for the water polo team.
Wilson has had an illustrious career of his own. Last year, he won two Ivy League championships in the span of three months. The football team took the Ivy League title, and Wilson individually won the 60-meter dash Ivy League Championship.
“That was very exciting, given all the work that went into it,” he says.

Harvard University is number… eight? Yes, that's right. Eight—at least according to a new matrix entitled "The Sexiest, Smartest Colleges In The Country" that was published on BuzzFeed  yesterday. The BuzzFeed graph plots Forbes' rankings of America's Top Colleges against DateMySchool's entirely scientific and not at all subjective or opinion-based hotness index, and features pictures of the most prominent, gorgeous brainiac alums from each university alongside a list of the Top 10 Sexy/Smart schools.
Harvard—represented by Rashida Jones (and not Natalie Portman?)—was beat out by seven schools, including two others in the Boston area—Boston University (#7) and Boston College (#6). The top five contenders are Harvard's Ivy League neighbors—Columbia in 5th, University of Pennsylvania in fourth, Princeton in third, and Dartmouth in second. Brown University is number one, complete with a snapshot of Emma Watson—proof that you still can't beat Hermione Granger.
 While this curious new ranking system places Harvard below a handful of its fellow Ivies, we at Flyby are pleased to report that Yale University does not even make Buzzfeed's Top Ten Sexiest, Smartest Colleges list, let alone come anywhere close to touching Harvard's number eight ranking. At least they got something right!
