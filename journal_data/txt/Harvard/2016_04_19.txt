99 Poems: March 1, 2016
Poetry can sometimes be daunting even for seasoned literary connoisseurs, but Dana Gioia’s book wants to be accessible to everyone on the literary spectrum, from book-burners to college students. (Given that you may need to have read a book to decide that you hate it enough to burn it, you all can decide which end of the spectrum is which.) For the perhaps more mathematically-challenged bibliophiles, the number of poems, “99,” is subtly yet distinctly re-printed in a large, opaque font for easy comprehension. For those less familiar with complex diction and allusive devices, Gioia kindly opts out of a self-referential literary title and spares us the task of analyzing images. Sometimes two plus two equals four, a cigar is just a cigar, and there are probably just 99 poems in a book titled “99 Poems.” The only potential points of confusion for any reader are the metaphorical meanings of the alternating black and white font and that particular shade of blue. Black and white, perhaps, to symbolize the ever-metamorphosizing, sometimes drastically changing nature of a genre? Was “poetry” the same art form when Gioia published the first of these poems as when he published the last? How did the masses receive poetry? What is poetry, really? The background periwinkle color might give us more insight into these themes of temporality and popular culture: Crayola added periwinkle to its official palette in 1949, just one year before Gioia’s birth. This analytical task stretches us a little but still leave us energy to read the volume cover to cover as fast as possible, as all collections—and especially poems—are supposed to be read. It’s an all-around winner.

The Throwback Special: March 14, 2016
The bold and mysterious cover of “The Throwback Special” stays true to its themes of the American male psyche. The novel centers around (American) football, but its cover lacks both the familiar soul- and phallus-stirring oblong shape and its charming coyote-and-cream color scheme. Instead it provides us a brilliant, subtle reference to femininity—so subtle, in fact, that it is literally the background—in the choice of a stunning, fertile green color. Hasty interpreters might think the shade mirrors that of Astroturf; we must note, however, that the font itself comprises loops reminiscent of shapes prevalent in female fashion and anatomy. In this context, the green can refer only to the Earth and fertility, presenting a strong female subtext to serve as a foil for the novel’s content. Or perhaps it foreshadows revolutionary psychological insights into the feminizing effects of American football. Intrepid readers will simply have to meet Bachelder’s publishers halfway and open the cover flap to find out, just as we will have to meet Bachelder halfway in the story, working past our stereotypes through the simple yet shockingly refreshing and never-before-done juxtaposition of American males and sports.

Imagine Me Gone: May 3, 2016
This one sounds a bit like a potential Adele track title, and like Adele album covers, it shuns color. The cover features the black text “Imagine/Me/Gone,” written “IMAGI E/ME/G NE,” on a bleak, soulless white background. The missing letters spell NO. NO, we can’t imagine you gone? NO, we won’t imagine you gone? NO, you aren’t gone? N(ever mind I’ll find s)O(meone like you)? The slightly depressing—-if not downright morbid—-possibilities are endless. You’ll be singing sadly and seeing the world in sepia before you read a single word of this highly-acclaimed and anticipated novel.

Rich and Pretty: June 7, 2016
“Rich and Pretty” is about two girls, Sarah and Lauren, who are, respectively, rich and pretty. The cover features two girls in its background, thin calves bared mid-stride and faces turned away from our prying eyes. What it doesn’t tell us: Who’s the rich one, and who’s the pretty one? One has a bob and another a lob; one wears pink, the other navy. Which hairstyle and color palette should we emulate if we aspire to be considered “pretty”? Do all rich people dress like that? These are important questions that most of us care about, so most of us will probably read the book after seeing its cover.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Turkish television can best be described as a mix between Greek tragedy and “Gossip Girl.” Unabashedly luxurious interiors mix with haute couture, and all throughout, the visual and emotional melodrama is grounded in strong, multifaceted characters. It is upon this tradition that “Game of Silence” enters. An NBC series based on the Turkish soap opera “Suskanlar” (which was in turn based off of the 1996 film “Sleepers”), “Game of Silence” explores themes of lost innocence, friendship, and justice. While the series offers fertile ground for arresting psychological portrayals and a good dose of intrigue, the writers eschew character development for a plot that can best be described as a Frankenblend of legal drama, telenovela, and revenge play. Less-than-stellar performances and often clumsy writing further plunge a promising drama into the realm of the insipid.
“Game of Silence” begins with Jackson (David Lyons) reminiscing about his childhood. He and his five friends are on an endless romp through small-town idyll, but after a rescue attempt nearly kills a woman, four of them are sent to juvenile prison. There, they suffer physical and psychological torture at the hands of the guards. It is at this point that Jackson delivers the kind of blundering comment that mars the promise of the plot: “We were like lambs to the slaughter.” This brand of ill-written wordplay proliferates in “Game of SIlence.” Other pithy sayings include “Fate, like life, is unpredictable” and “There are lies we tell ourselves to make us feel better about who we are.”
As uncreative as these lines are, they remain salvageable. Unfortunately, the cast of “Game of Silence” can barely handle dialogue, much less pick up the rubble left behind by a perfect storm of cliches. In an unplanned reunion, Jackson and Jessie (Bre Blair) try to convey chemistry, only to lapse into an unconvincing concoction of sideways looks and forced laughter. The other actors seem equally uncomfortable with each other, and without this engagement, the “let the good times roll” atmosphere feels more like an Applebee’s commercial than an old gang reunion. Unlike an Applebee’s commercial, however, the show lasts an entire painful hour. While the writing and actors provide no respite, the plot at this point is tantalizing enough to warrant the commitment.
Yet even this promising aspect is overdone, as it turns out that the prison warden who oversaw the boys’ abuse is now using drug dealing to finance a run for the Senate. The writers would have done better to leave the narco drama for the narco dramas, as this revelation marks the point at which the “Game of Silence” morphs into a jack-of-all-trades. The class contrasts inherent in this revelation are emblematic of those in the rest of the film: Jackson’s comfortable lifestyle seems almost decadent when compared to the working-class existences of his friends. But like the show’s other promising elements, this thread is not pursued.
Due to its disparate elements, “Game of Silence” misses the opportunity to connect with some of today’s most relevant themes, such as prison conditions, child abuse, and the justice system’s failure of rape victims. While viewers will certainly leave the show with goosebumps, they will not be caused by anything the show does right: instead, they will most likely be caused by cringeworthy metaphors and a plot so disparate that it calls to mind the grotesque more than the thrilling.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coachella is ostensibly one of the most popular and profitable music festivals in the world—so much so that they livestreamed the entire weekend. Consequently, it seemed almost inevitable that one would see on stage singer-songwriter Sufjan Stevens in a gaudily-patterned jumpsuit and a pair of feathery angel wings. The nearly hour-long set he performed the evening of April 15 was stocked with your typical festival fare, including airdancers, laser light guns, and balloons. But this performance wasn’t just glamour. First of all, this was a revival. And second of all, for the past year, Stevens has been performing show after show of songs about death. This performance was a way to dial back that mourning and to push forward toward ecstatic living.
The wings he wore? They’re the same pair that he donned back in 2011 on a world tour for “Age of Adz,” an experimental electronic pop album about heartbreak and illness. The banjo he smashed on stage? That was an echo of similar acts of 2011-era banjotastic violence. It’s the symbol of a jagged transition toward more chaotic sonic territory. In his performance, Stevens certainly did move on from the soft-edged “Carrie & Lowell,” a shimmering collection of tracks that commemorate his mother’s life and death. From the trio choreography of sinuous dance moves during the joyous yet fatalistic “Too Much” to the soft iterations of the eponymous lyric from “I Want To Be Well,” Stevens seemed intent on delivering an experience that was both old and new, both electric and intimate. Even though the choreography was at times half-hearted and the audience strangely quiet, Stevens was undoubtedly having fun, bantering in between songs and grinning wildly, despite his widespread reputation for being entirely too sad to listen to sometimes, with such favored tracks as “Casimir Pulaski Day” or “To Be Alone With You.”
The most Coachella aspect of the performance was Stevens’ chaotic, ebullient, absolutely nuts performance of the 25-minute epic track “Impossible Soul.” If you’ve never listened to the song before, it’s helpful to divide it into sections. Stevens’ outfits changed with each new movement, from a sleeveless disco ball-patterned onesie and glittery cap to a shimmering tinsel-fringed get-up with a postmodern hula hoop halo to the enormous balloon robe that was a staple of his 2011 tour. As he danced about the stage, singing of how things aren’t so impossible when you work together, the crowd at Coachella must have been possessed with a certain feeling of abundance. Does it makes sense that a man who has been lauded for writing such tender ballads about an absent mother could also gallivant across stage in metallic splendor? Stevens says yes. The sentiment of possibility, like many of Stevens’ ideas, can seem at times quaint and naive; his own self-deprecatory comments during the show made clear his awareness of such criticism. But this performance was what Coachella honestly needed, more than any spectacle or sound: a testament to wonder and growth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Dance Project’s “What Moves You,” a collaboration between choreographers Jill Johnson, Francesca Harper, and Mario Zambrano, incorporated writing, sound, and the experiences of its dancers into its creation and performance. Highly interdisciplinary and introspective, the production ran in Farkas Hall from April 14-17.
Jill E. Johnson, who serves as Harvard’s director of dance and senior lecturer in the Department of Music and Theater, Dance, and Media, traces the original inspiration for the show to a reflection upon larger cultural movements. “We were thinking a lot about what was happening in the greater culture—issues of discrimination, cultural identity, how that touched on dance and environments that we’d been in, and in particular how those things are affecting students,” she says. “We weren’t sure where that was going to lead.… We wanted to make sure there was enough time to really talk through things that people were thinking about, and so we kept coming back to the question that seemed to be particularly rich terrain for us, which is: What moves you?”
During the show’s formative process, the dancers were asked to write a response to this foundational question. Their answers found their way into the final production as moments of spoken word, comprising both recognizable sentences in the form of letters to the dancer’s future selves or younger siblings and grammarless phrases that could be more accurately categorized as word associations. Students spoke to their hopes and fears: concerns about how society takes control of bodies and identities, how race and gender seem to restrict art, preoccupation with time, and fear of failure. Certain phrases that the dancers generated recurred throughout the show along with their corresponding dance motifs. Dancers tapped their chests twice with an open palm in homage to the more organic practice of keeping time in heartbeats rather than ticked-away seconds or days.
For performer La’Toya Princess Jackson, the process of generating and perfecting such an intimate and multifaceted work was quite challenging and extremely rewarding. “We had to explore movement from a deeply personal place,” she says. “Interweaving and connecting our experiences to one another, we had to find ways to share what moves us through words and translate those words into movement phrases. It was a deeply moving and enriching experience for all the dancers involved.”
Johnson notes that the show’s structure differs from what many of the dancers might have been accustomed to. “We’re exposing a way of making that’s very iterative, generating a ton of things, practicing things, and it’s not necessarily linear,” she says. “The sounds, too, spoke to this form of creation, varying from live singing to excerpted instrumental melodies and soft recorded street noises. [They are] dialing in and out of focus with the lights and bodies’ motions.”
The internal monologue of “What Moves You” extended clearly to many of its audience. “What I love about this show is just that it’s so iterative,” says audience member Sofia A. Escudero ‘16. “You recognize things and see things repeat and change and evolve. That’s always moving to me, to see dancers just having this communication that’s palpable in the air.”
To build upon the show’s more outwardly directed, social aspect, audience members had the option of writing their thoughts down on Post-It notes as a form of off-the-grid Twitter. “There’s a discovery energy that’s very compelling to watch in real time…. An audience member might not be able to put their fingers on it, but they’ve had the experience being in consort with the cast, because it’s such an intimate piece.” Johnson say.
Jackson echoes this sentiment. “The beauty in the way each dancer revealed their inner soul created a dynamic force,” she says. “I hope the audience was moved by our words and our movement. I hope they experienced the raw emotion from each dancer. I hope they were inspired to think of art as a transformative tool. I hope they were inspired to truly think about the world differently.”

Exactly one year ago this past Friday, “OSCAR at The Crown and the love that dare not speak its name,” created by Mark J. Mauriello ’15, opened at OBERON, a dance club-cum-theater venue just east of Harvard Square. While the play served as Mauriello’s senior thesis for his special concentration in Theater Arts and Performance, it traces its roots back not to a Harvard classroom but to OBERON itself. “I created the show and dreamed up the show my sophomore year for OBERON,” Mauriello says. “It was never not going to be there. [The] influence of having experienced work and been a part of work in that space, which was so exciting for me, made me want to make work for that space.”
Although Harvard did not have a theater concentration before Theater, Dance and Media began accepting concentrators this year—a lacuna that required students passionate about theater like Mauriello to craft a special concentration or limit their engagement with theater to the extracurricular sphere—Harvard’s campus has been home to a professional theater since the American Repertory Theater, of which OBERON is a part, was founded in 1980. Primarily located in the Loeb Drama Center, which also hosts a number of Harvard-Radcliffe Drama Club shows, the A.R.T. has become one of the best-known and most successful theaters in the United States, particularly since Diane Paulus took over as artistic director in 2008. In the past four years, the A.R.T. has sent seven shows to Broadway; four of them have won Tony Awards.
While it is possible to spend four years at Harvard and never interact with the A.R.T. directly, there are several theatrically inclined students every year who, like Mauriello, center a great deal of their Harvard experience on the A.R.T. For these students, almost all of whom came to Harvard with the knowledge that the school offered no established theater program at the time, the A.R.T. can become just as important—if not more important—than their academic lives. “I can’t imagine my time at Harvard or even just my own artistic growth without the A.R.T.,” Mauriello says.
With the advent of TDM, however, this relationship is set to evolve. By design, TDM and the A.R.T. are intimately linked—In addition to Paulus, A.R.T. producer Diane Borger, dramaturge Ryan McKittrick, and associate director Marcus Stern all serve on the Standing Committee on Theater, Dance & Media. The entrance of TDM onto the Harvard stage seems to demand an examination and redefinition of Harvard’s relationship to the A.R.T. and to the Boston theater community as a whole.
While not every Harvard student involved in theater has such a close relationship to the A.R.T. as Mauriello did, some degree of interaction is difficult to avoid. “If you’re a part of HRDC and you go to Common Casting at the Loeb…that’s the most minimal amount you’re going to have a relationship with the A.R.T., because of that shared building,” says Mauriello. “That overlap of space is huge.”
Emily E. Bergquist ’18, a government concentrator who is nevertheless heavily involved with the A.R.T., agrees, saying she sees salient benefits from that proximity. “We literally share a building and a shop and a stage with [the A.R.T.],” she says. “So even if I’m not actively seeking out people to help [me], there are just people around who want to teach and help.”
For Bergquist, the simple awareness of this shared space has proven profoundly inspirational. “‘Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812’ [a musical that went up in the A.R.T. last year and is currently in the process of moving to Broadway] is one of [the best]—if not the best—shows I have ever seen,” she says. “Especially because we share the physical stage with [the A.R.T.], it’s really powerful to go watch the ‘Great Comet of 1812’ and be like, ‘Oh, I also did a show here, a month prior. What they do in their show I can use in my show.’”
 
Beyond this basic level of interaction and inspiration ensured by the HRDC and the A.R.T. putting up shows on the same stages, members of Harvard’s theater community have manifold opportunities to deepen their connections to the A.R.T. The A.R.T. offers a summer internship that, according to Bergquist, usually takes between eight and 10 Harvard students each year. It is also entirely possible to work there during the school year, although such situations are comparatively less codified. “After I did ‘Comet,’ because I want to be a producer…I asked if I could be an intern in the…Artistic Office, where the producers and the company manager work, just to…be a fly on the wall with them,” Bergquist says. She has found that internship to be profoundly valuable. “Several of the people that work here are now good friends of mine,” she says. “I really go to them a lot and am constantly asking them questions about what to do with my show and how to be a person who works in professional theater.”
Mauriello similarly benefited from seeking out greater interaction with the A.R.T. During his time at Harvard, he was in the cast of A.R.T. shows “The Lily’s Revenge” and “The Donkey Show,” and he also worked in the marketing office. For Mauriello, his high level of involvement is easily explicable. “I showed up and said ‘yes,’” he says.
Though its productions are in general less well known than those put on at the Loeb Mainstage—as a crude indicator, only shows from the Mainstage have gone to Broadway—OBERON often has an apparently disproportionate role in Harvard students’ interactions with the A.R.T. This phenomenon is no random chance. “Generally, once a semester they’ll let students do a show there,” says Bergquist, who was involved in three productions at OBERON during her freshman year alone. “I really started to form relationships with the [professionals] at OBERON…and to establish more of a mentor-mentee relationship there.”
OBERON is a space uniquely conducive to such relationships. The Loeb Mainstage and the Loeb Ex frequently host student productions, but those productions are entirely student-run and do not involve A.R.T. staff in any major capacity. Putting on a student show at the Mainstage is therefore a significant undertaking. “The Mainstage…is just so big, and as a student you’re kind of on your own, and so you just have to [get] to the finish line of finishing your set and getting it done and doing your lights,” Bergquist says.
OBERON, on the other hand, provides student productions with its in-house professional lighting designer, sound designer, and production manager. “So because I’m not worried about live mixing microphones and doing lighting design, I can focus on how…I want to make this prop just right, and [on] the scenic design,” Bergquist says. “I always say OBERON is my personal playground.” Perhaps unsurprisingly, Bergquist is considering completing a project at OBERON next semester.
Mauriello, who put up his senior thesis at OBERON, feels similarly tied to the space. “After having worked at OBERON for a long time, it truly even still does feel like home,” he says. “And I miss my home at OBERON, and I miss the staff and artists there who I remember.”

Both the Loeb and OBERON, then, have facilitated connections between the Harvard theater community and the A.R.T., a core part of the Boston theater community. With the advent of TDM, however, those sorts of connections are now possible in Farkas Hall, TDM’s stage.
“The relationship between TDM and A.R.T. in a way is very simple to describe, namely that it’s super close,” says Martin Puchner, chair of Theater, Dance & Media. “The A.R.T. is really right now, I would say, the main pillar on which TDM stands…. And I think the relationship will be even closer—if that’s imaginable—in the future, because I think more opportunities for working together will emerge.”

This connection between TDM and the outside theater community does provide salient benefit to concentrators in several ways. “I took this class with Yale School of Drama professor David Chambers, and it was the best class I ever took,” says Sam A. Hagen ’18, a TDM concentrator. Hagen also appreciates that the concentration seeks to expose its students to Boston theater, as when his sophomore tutorial took the entire class to see “An Octoroon” at ArtsEmerson. “Giving us access to the outside community through resources—bulk ticket buying and the financial comfort of the TDM department…is great, because, what, was I going to check boston-theater.com to check what shows were playing this weekend?” he says.

At one point during my conversation with Bergquist, a woman with straight, silvered hair walked by and greeted her warmly. It took me a moment to realize that woman was Diane Paulus. According to Bergquist, such interactions are a regular part of her A.R.T. experience, although they are by no means humdrum. “Sometimes it’s crazy to me that I sit at my desk and Tony Award-winning director Diane Paulus walks by and is like, ‘Good morning, Emily, how was your test?’” she says. “That’s super surreal sometimes.”
Mauriello developed numerous close relationships within the A.R.T. and the Boston theater community while at Harvard—relationships that he views as particular to the A.R.T.’s role on Harvard’s campus and ability to place famous performers and student interns in a single space. “I was able to form a great relationship with Courtney Love, who I worked with, and that was amazing,” Mauriello says. “I admired her and thought she was brilliant for so long, and then we had a great relationship and we worked together,” he says. “It’s not only incredibly special but I think incredibly unique to the partnership of A.R.T. and Harvard.”

In Hagen’s case, his relationship with MIT professor and theater designer Sara Brown elevated his experience on “The Man Who” beyond the sphere of the conventional internship. “What was really valuable about working under Sara was not only is she a professional designer, but she’s a theater educator at her heart,” Hagen says. “Not only did she know how to design a set and design a set well…but she also knew how to do so while showing me and telling me what she was doing and guiding me about how to have the eye for good set design.”
Puchner sees a great deal of value in the sort of relationship Hagen and Brown had while working on “The Man Who,” and he hopes to encourage them further in TDM, in part borrowing from the A.R.T. model. “One of the things that both the A.R.T. and our big TDM shows [do] is that we bring in a lot of professionals—professional designers, sound designers, lighting designers, and so on and so forth—and students work with them, and you’re part of a professional theater experience,” he says. “And I think that’s really necessary, if you want to [pursue professional theater]. I think it’s a great learning opportunity.”
Through these sorts of opportunities, the A.R.T. and TDM train the next generation of actors, directors, playwrights, producers, and designers. In some cases, this idea of succession feels quite literal. Paulus was herself a student at Harvard, and so Mauriello feels a deep connection to the stories she tells about her A.R.T. experience and the famous artists she saw there as a student. “Whenever I hear her tell that story, I always think it’s just the same thing [with me],” he says. “It’s kind of funny now that she’s the artistic director and she, along with Diane Borger and the rest of the staff, are now bringing all these even more new and exciting and remarkable artists, and I feel so lucky having had this mirrored experience.... It’s like that theater and that stage is vibrating with history of insane greatness…. And then every once in awhile they let us 20-somethings run amok on the stage…. It’s pure insanity, and I’m so grateful for it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“What does ‘taking up space’ mean to you? How do you take up space? Your response might be included in tonight’s performance,” read one of several slips of paper resting on a table covered in red cloth at Oberon, the American Repertory Theatre’s sister space on the fringes of Harvard Square.
That prompt—answers to which did become part of the performance—aptly describes “SHE,” an original musical revue that ran from April 14 to 15. With music and lyrics by Liz P. Kantor ’18 and short scenes written by Rachel C. Talamo ’18, the production traced how the cast of young women navigate friendship and hardship, learn, change, and grow, unapologetically asserting their presence. Despite neck-craning staging and oftentimes stilted transitions between scenes, “SHE” ultimately derived its strength from combining Kantor’s amazing songs with a fabulous five-piece orchestra and a cast of members who truly internalized the mission of the show. “Although we cannot share every woman’s story in 90 minutes, or even begin to capture the beautiful kaleidoscope comprised of women’s experiences, we hope this show will encourage more people to share and embrace these stories,” director Karen Chee ’17 wrote in her program note. “We hope that some of them will resonate with you.”
Both passionate and catchy, Kantor’s music filled the space throughout the evening. Indeed, the production would have benefitted from more breathing room in between those beautiful songs, rather than moving quickly from musical number to monologue to scene. In the opening number, “Dear Daughter,”  Kiki M. Albanese ’19, Ali Astin ’19, Lindsey C. Ruggles ’19, Emma S. Schwartz ’18, and the company broke the fourth wall between stage and audience, inviting viewers conversationally into the space. From their separate marks around Oberon’s second-floor catwalk, the performers sang best when they sang all together. Their message rang out clear: Seek out experiences, learn from them, and hold your own (“Don’t be afraid of cuts, ’cause Bandaids are cheap,” one performer sang). Strong vocals by Albanese and Julia E. Belanoff ’18 in “Take Up Space,” by Meghan Onserio ’19 and Nora A. Sagal ’18 in “Friendship,” and by Madison E. Deming ’18 and the entire company in “Here I Am” anchored the production.
The monologues and scenes, which punctuated these musical numbers, effectively blended cast members’ personal stories and fictional takes on real-life experiences. The show took painstaking care to bring the audience into conversations about menstruation, pregnancy scares, and sexual assault on campus. And though some scenes were a bit too long or rough around the edges, that the show verged on unstreamlined both conveyed the cast’s dedication to the material and made their performances more real. Onserio’s incredibly thoughtful humor as a bathroom confidante and Deming’s reading of a personal text message, in particular, struck a chord.
At the end of the night, the group shone, singing in harmony under Oberon’s characteristic disco ball. The points they had raised in the previous hour and a half lingered with the music.

The Charles
He remembered how Virginia had done it. Rather, he remembered how Nicole Kidman had done it in that movie with her ridiculous prosthetic nose. He remembered how her shoes had sunk into the mud and how her eyes had remained straight ahead. He remembered her pale hands. He remembered how natural it all felt.
The pavement moved beneath his feet. Bow Street curved and became Dewolfe. His body shot forward, blowing the lapels of his peacoat back. Larger and larger stones slipped from the ground to his palms and into the pockets of the coat his father had bought him. The thick fabric pulled heavier on his shoulders, but he only moved faster.
Peter had broken another person’s heart. He had sinned. It lay shattered on the carpeted floor of his Canaday common room. Other Noah never wanted to speak to him again.  And maybe that was a stupid reason to want to die, but in his own heart he felt like a murderer. He was murderer of Love, which was worth more to him than life.
He was no angel. His murder had shattered his humanity.  This place—this school, this world—was so preoccupied with the brain.  It didn’t appreciate the value of a person’s heart. He hated that this place had turned him into someone who could murder a piece of another person. And he was only a freshman—what would three more years in this world do to him? People jumped off the Weeks Footbridge to prove something, but he had nothing to prove. He imagined the cold water swallowing him, rushing around him, pulling him down until he escaped that artificial world with its synthetic priorities. It would feel so natural, finally.
He was standing on the bridge. His leather boots hung just over the edge of the stone railing. The water flowed and the trees shook. The world moved around him, out of his realm of control. Then the world stopped. All was still.
Hang on.
The Charles was frozen.
Yes, it was technically spring, but Snowmaggedon was keeping the Charles securely sealed in a thick layer of ice. He was so stupid. He thought more clearly, it seemed, than his mind ever had before. If he were to jump, he would not be enveloped by the water. Yes, the stones and the boots and the peacoat and momentum might pull him through, but he’d still hit the layer of ice. He’d splat. It wouldn’t feel natural. It would be clunky.
His body was shaking. He couldn’t tell whether he was crying or laughing. How could he have been so stupid? What beautiful, rapturous idiocy! The spell was broken, and Dewolfe Street and St. Paul and Mass Ave and Widener Gate blew past him once again. The stones jumped out of his pockets, and he soared back through Tercentenary Theater.
He stopped in front of the tree that Delilah had shown him—the small, beautiful tree beside Memorial Church that had kept its leaves long past when the others had relinquished theirs to the winter months. Peter climbed high into the branches of the tree. He sat in the tree for hours, gripping onto the branches. He basked in the nature that surrounded him.  The twigs and bark hugged his body.  He watched people pass beneath him. He observed as the rest of the world continued to move around him, blind to the boy in the tree. He began to shiver in the cold. He wouldn’t have minded freezing solid, attached to this tree for eons, removed from the thawing, ebbing, and flowing world. The cold clawed into his bones. His heartbeat slowed.
“Peter?”
“Wha—whoa!”
“Are you surprising someone?!”
“You got me—”
“Who are we spooking?”
Peter hopped down from the tree and stood with the ArchAngels, Samson and Delilah. They were headed back from a midnight Market run. They would have invited him, but they thought he’d had a p-set. The glow from their halos warmed Peter. They all continued on to Canaday and, just like that, the events of the night blew into the past. No one questioned him. What was now had been. The angels walked him home and chilled in his room for a few hours.

The Sophomore
The Sophomore is a fool. The Sophomore thinks he knows much more than he knows. The Sophomore has seen things. He has felt things. He has learned. He is one year older. He lives life by his heart. The Sophomore is wise.
The Sophomore stands on the Weeks Footbridge, heartbroken. Murderers tend to return to the scene of their crime, and he is no exception. He feels it gives him strength. The Charles beats beneath him, past the Low-Rise and the Tower and behind him into the glowing future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I tell people how much I like “Bojack Horseman,” they ask a lot of questions. “It’s so sad,” they always tell me. When discussing it with others, the most frequent comment is how the show would hardly be classed as a comedy if not for the animation and the intermingling of humans and animals as main and supporting characters.
The rawness of Bojack springs from its strains of monotony and failure. Though it is never explicitly stated, Bojack’s struggles with alcoholism and his existential grappling with meaninglessness point to his suffering from depression. I notice this because I find it all too relatable.
Throughout the latter half of my high school career, I often found myself in much the same state of hopelessness Bojack regularly encounters. I forced myself past it, throwing myself into schoolwork and neglecting to maintain friendships or relationships. I had my own methods of self-medicating. Like Bojack, I tried to convince myself that my depression was rooted in the fear of being unloved and that if I could win the affections of someone, I would be cured. This never was the case.
Portraying mental illness on television takes a deft hand. The fact is, mental illness hides easily. It can disappear entirely in polite company, if only as a means of protection for the sufferer. Addiction, an illness in itself, is easier to show. A person’s downward spiral is visible, and witnessing that spiral is, in many ways, a voyeuristic act. It is far harder, on the other hand, to make the daily realities of mental illness interesting and observable.
Netflix’s “Jessica Jones,” much like Bojack, is about dark sides and hidden facets. Though on the surface it seems like any other superficial superhero show, it looks far more deeply into the complexities of Jessica’s psyche than into the lurid excitement of action and fight scenes. Jessica, like Bojack, self-medicates with alcohol. But this coping mechanism takes a secondary role to her struggles with PTSD and the pain of fighting the forces that caused it.
“Jessica Jones” handles far more elegantly than most the realities of triggers and anxiety that come with surviving trauma. It also puts a face to abuse—an attractive face, the face of one who gaslights and manipulates rather than using his fists. Abusers don’t always leave bruises. Victims spend time convincing themselves that it wasn’t what the abuser said, that the abuser’s words and blame and manipulation are just part of the abuser’s identity or somehow not the abuser’s fault. I know I did.
The true villains of these shows are not television rivals or criminal masterminds. They are the demons of the mind, wearing you down until you forget whether you’re person or illness, or if there’s still a person inside of that pain. The very real and very evil manifestation of Jessica’s demons can be vanquished, can have his neck snapped by her hand. All I could do was block mine on Facebook.
What I see as the most important part of both these shows is that they don’t blame the victim. Certainly, both Jessica Jones and Bojack Horseman make mistakes. They hurt people around them and make harmful decisions motivated by their illnesses—but they are still, in some ways, sympathetic. The viewer can love them for the good still in them rather than for the things that hurt them.
At one point, in a dream, Bojack is made to recite the line, “This is all I am and all I’ll ever be.” That simple line gets to the heart of the fear that goes along with depression, as with much mental illness. There is no magic cure, no tumor to be cut out and no infection to be eradicated. It sits with you; it dies down and flares up and tells you lies to make you think things won’t change. But they always do. My demons are far away now. I still cringe when I hear their names, but I don’t cry as much anymore. This isn’t all I am, and it’s not all I’ll ever be. There is so, so much more beyond this.

To the Editor:
Having received a ballot for the election of new Overseers for Harvard University, I note that five nominees ("by petition") are running under the banner of "Free Harvard, Fair Harvard." I am disappointed to see that only two of them graduated from Harvard College, and two of them graduated from Harvard Law School.  And yet the free tuition they espouse appears to be directed at the College;  I can't imagine they are campaigning for free tuition to the Law School.
And yet they act as if the entire endowment is available for tuition at Harvard College. Such a false argument may be more applicable to Princeton, from which two of them graduated and which, I understand, has the highest ratio of endowment funds to  undergraduates.
I am also disappointed to see that one of the petition candidates characterizes Harvard University as "a tax-exempt hedge fund." Most of us assume that Harvard's tax-exempt status is related to education. But I suppose, if one is a hammer, everything else looks like a nail.

Upon reading former Porcellian graduate board president Charles Storey’s comments in The Crimson, I was tempted to bang out a bitingly snide response. Apparently, so were many others, sparking a social media firestorm that prompted a hasty, profit-minded apology and ultimately culminated in Storey's resignation. But while Storey has fallen on his sword, this personnel change does little to challenge the views to which he gave voice. These views—while unpopular in many circles—are nonetheless pervasive among members and alumni of Harvard's male final clubs. Storey did not pen his remarks in a vacuum; I hope this op-ed will foster the kind of rational discourse that changes not only figureheads, but also underlying points of view.   
The traditions Storey and others ardently defend have hardly been static across centuries. While the history of his organization is notoriously—and deliberately—opaque, its composition has presumably evolved along with that of Harvard’s student body, albeit at times with significant delays. This would inevitably involve radical shifts in response to changes occurring within the university itself—changes many considered cataclysmic.
Harvard College awarded the first degree to a black candidate in 1870 to Richard Greener. Let us suppose that the Porcellian’s membership clamored to welcome Greener to campus via initiation into the club. If so, he must have declined this esteemed invitation, helping explain reports that the Porcellian did not admit a black member until 1983. This century-long delay suggests that the admission of the Porcellian’s first African-American member caused its fair share of debate and strife. There was similarly an era before Jewish or openly gay members were welcomed through the club’s hogshead-topped doorframe.
Such unilateral discrimination against these demographics would—we trust—seem unthinkable today. Why, then, is reflexive, illogical prejudice towards women more palatable?
The Porcellian hardly stands alone in perpetuating on-campus discrimination. The College fought for decades to exclude women. Even once de facto coeducation began as a wartime concession, women were excluded from numerous academic buildings until the 1964 integration of Lamont Library. In 1970, the first (male) student to move into Mather House, my undergraduate home, unabashedly told The Crimson that Lowell House’s decision to go coed had been “an impetus to get out early.” Despite completing identical coursework, men and women did not receive identical diplomas until 1999.
True, men and women have been socialized separately for centuries. Yet might I suggest that this system, rather than reflecting innate difference, instead developed to reinforce differentiated expectations? Women were encouraged to form separate organizations for the same reason they were required to sit through home economics lessons on the fine art of removing your husband's shoes when he returned home from a long day of performing work closed to women.
I will not do Storey or the Porcellian’s membership the injustice of implying they long to return to this bygone era. Instead, I would urge them to consider whether their organization is, unwittingly perhaps, an anachronistic vestige of a time most American women are relieved to feel safely behind them.
Those who desperately cling to a “separate but equal” vision of socialization must concede that while Harvard’s single-gender clubs are certainly separate, the disparate distribution of real estate amongst single-gender clubs categorically precludes parity in the College’s social scene. Even female clubs who rent prime Harvard Square real estate are beholden to their landlords—male clubs. If—despite all evidence—one assumed equality in these spaces, longstanding legal precedents reflecting broader societal values acknowledge that separate spaces inherently reflect and reinforce inferior status.
To address concerns about sexual assault: The claim that introducing women into a traditionally male space would open the floodgates to sexual violence attempts to cast commingling itself as the root cause of sexual assault—a wholly indefensible and irresponsible suggestion that would absolve perpetrators of sexual violence of responsibility.
Taking a more empirical approach, we might consider the US military, a male-dominated body with disproportionate rates of sexual violence. While integrating combat units initially sparked fears—typically voiced by men—of increased assault, comprehensive studies released by news outlets and members of Congress fail to find evidence that gender integration increases the risk of sexual assault. None suggest gender segregation as a remedy to sexual violence. Concern for this important issue makes for a sympathetic public-relations soundbite, but the data fail to support a single-gender solution to the question of sexual violence in Harvard’s clubs.
As an American history teacher, Storey’s comparison between a policy of parity and McCarthyism struck me as particularly misguided. I might offer a more relevant analogy: When George Wallace stood on the steps of the University of Alabama vowing to uphold “segregation today, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever,” he almost certainly failed to realize that he was on the wrong side of history. Like many who socialize in an insular community—whether the rolling hills of Alabama or the cooler climes of an Ivory Tower—he was tone-deaf to the changing realities around him.
I am not naïve (or narcissistic) enough to believe that changes in Harvard’s social scene will revolutionize gender relations nationwide. But integration is a meaningful, long-overdue step towards dismantling pervasive campus prejudices that inform the conduct of alumni long after graduation. Surely a club which stakes its prestige on the national leaders it counts among its alumni should leap at the chance to position itself among leaders of the twenty-first century. As The Crimson editorialized following the integration of Lamont, "Down with separate-but-equal. Up with together-but-different.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
No memory burns itself into the front of your brain like your first time. Every detail gains folkloric significance and becomes a permanent component of an origin story that helps define who you are. Mine took place during a fun-filled weekend getaway with friends at one of their universities. The memory of the cool October night will stay with me forever, for better or worse.
After only starting college a month prior, for some reason, I felt it necessary to plan a summit of some of my friends at one of our colleges. Throughout high school, we made plans to have regular reunions to make sure we did not drift apart. The weekend promised mild debauchery and a heavy dose of reminiscing. Noticing that my style of dress had drifted towards preppy during the beginning of freshman year, I made a conscious decision: no polos, no collars, and a snapback for every night.
Without a doubt, clothing matters. This does not mean that it should, but that does not reduce the impact it has on others’ perception. On some level, we choose what we wear, and thus, we can use it as a means to signal something. What you wear is a function of how much disposable income you have, among other things.
For the weekend, my choice was clear. I did not want to spend my time with my buddies wearing the boat shoes and button downs of the Harvard prep student I tried to emulate. Black high-top Nikes, black American flag t-shirt, and a black Mitchell and Ness Brooklyn Nets snapback: the clothing that made me feel most at home with my friends.
From the second I hopped off the bus, the weekend went as well as I could have hoped. We ate food that drastically endangered our health, we made jokes we would not want our parents to hear, and we talked about old times as we got ready to go out for the night. For a brief, brilliant moment, we felt free of the world of pressures quietly crushing us from without. All that mattered was right in front of us.
We met up with a group of friends on campus to start strategizing the night to come. Walking and talking, I began to fall behind from the group somewhat. As we reached a security checkpoint, everyone flashed their ID with implacable casualty and went on their way. Except me.
The officer stopped me, asked my name, who was I with, where was I from, whether I was in school, and to empty my pockets. In the grand scheme of things, this is a relatively mild interaction. I was not hurt or arrested, and flashing my Harvard ID brought silence quickly. I would even argue that I have been lucky in my interactions with law enforcement, since this was one of the worst incidences I’ve experienced. But these thoughts miss the point.
This is not an article about the racial profiling done by police, an issue far too large to properly depict in a short column. It’s about the sometimes difficult-to-define but nonetheless expansive differences in the college experience for people of color.
Everything in my life filters through race in one way or another. My own personal attitudes towards the world have been shaped through a history of racialized experience, and I fear others have gone through the same process from the other side. When I sit in class, I worry about both becoming the voice of the black public and not speaking up enough to counteract stereotypes of black people. I never feel comfortable running through campus at night, but also worry about not allowing myself the freedom I deserve.
Safe spaces and vocabulary cannot single-handedly solve the numerous problems that POCs face everyday on campus. While these are central tenets of an equitable social environment, the issues they are trying to solve run far deeper. On a basic level, people of color must consider the most mundane actions, like getting dressed, on a far more consequential level than others. Decisions about clothing can turn into the value judgments that define you entire being in the mind of others. Every decision, every action feels just as uncomfortable and leaves me as vulnerable as the first time, and I don’t know if that will ever change.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The end of late-night weekend T service in March marked disappointment for many commuters in the greater Boston area. But fortunately, three transportation advocates have proposed a sensible plan for all-night, daily bus service to replace the discontinued subway service. The MBTA should work to implement this proposal by the summer. And as it does so, T administrators and state political leaders should consider more proactive solutions to the region’s transportation woes, rather than continually pursuing ideas in reaction to public pressure and fiscal crises.
The all-night bus service plan—the brain-child of transportation blogger and planner Ari Ofsevit, transportation advocate Jeremy Mandelson, and former Massachusetts Transportation Secretary James Aloisi—combines a cost-effective approach with the ambitious goal of “putting the bulk of the most densely populated parts of Boston and surrounding communities within a 20-minute walk of a bus stop.” Taking cues from existing routes and from successful early morning services to Logan Airport, the proposal calls for nightly buses that would reach key parts of Boston and Cambridge, as well as nine other cities and towns. A central pulse point like Copley Square, where all routes would converge hourly, would facilitate easy transfers between routes. Importantly, the plan would be far less expensive than the discontinued weekend service and would make “low-income areas and job access routes” the priority—precisely the places most in need of reliable overnight transit.
At a meeting last week, the MBTA’s board seemed to consider the proposal seriously. Though the board did not come to a final decision in that meeting, they should move to approve the proposal quickly so that it can take effect over the summer. The benefits of this plan, in allowing working people to commute to overnight jobs and helping to ensure that Boston’s mass transit system lives up to the city’s global status, are clear.
Beyond the immediate implementation of this proposal, the MBTA and leaders on Beacon Hill should use the continuing debate over late-night service as an opportunity to create a broader vision for the future of public transportation in the Greater Boston area. While recent conversations have focused on the necessity on cost-cutting, this concentration has rendered policy-making too reactive. Plans like the one currently under consideration contain within them the seeds of a more proactive transportation agenda for Boston. As Harvard economics professor Edward Glaeser has written, Boston’s mass transit system needs initiatives like “cooler buses,” not just new savings at the expense of riders.
The MBTA’s goal should be to provide a more comprehensive framework for the future of mass transit in Boston and the surrounding area, starting with a renewed commitment to overnight service. Ideally, this would include the eventual return of some extended train services in addition to the new bus proposal. As Mandelson, Ofsevit, and Aloisi wrote in explaining their plan, Boston’s lack of overnight service compares unfavorably with its urban peers. Beginning this summer, the T and state political leaders should ensure that the Hub starts catching up.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Surrounded by cheering supporters, handmade signs, and countless bottles of Gatorade, Harvard students—and at least one dean—took to the streets for the 120th annual Boston Marathon on Monday.
The Boston Marathon, the oldest annual marathon in the world, was first held in 1897. Since a pair of bombs exploded near the finish line in 2013, the marathon has served as a symbol of Boston’s resilience, and this year more than 30,000 people registered to run.
“I feel like I can’t walk right now, but other than that spirits are high,” Carolyn Z. Bruckmann ’16 said of the race, which was her first marathon. “I’ll nap for a while.”
Many other Harvard marathon runners were similarly sore like Bruckmann, but said they were pleased with the race and glad they had the chance to compete.
“It was such an incredible experience,” Jenny Li ’19 said of her race on Monday. “The runners that were there were from all over. I saw people from Tufts, someone from Mexico and Chad.”
Many runners who competed said they were struck in particular by the support they received from spectators along the course.
“It was incredible to have all the cheering crowds pushing you forward,” Jennifer F.N. Kizza ’16 said. “The spirit of it is incredible.”
Students from Wellesley College made up one particularly spirited group of spectators, according to Charles A. Scherr ’17, who also ran in the marathon. Those students lined the course section near Wellesley’s campus to participate in the annual “scream tunnel,” a tradition that caught on in the 1970s, according to Wellesley’s website.
“From both sides of the course they push in and make the road really narrow,” Scherr said of the Wellesley students. “You hear their screams from, no joke, a mile away. When you get there it’s deafening.”
Kevin Zhu ’18 said the cheering from supporters and from friends in particular made running the race more enjoyable.
“You see your friends out there, and every time I did I rushed the stands,” Zhu said. “You feel a lot more motivated and I’m not sure if it’s less pain, but you’re less aware of it.”
In addition to the pleasure of seeing friends cheering her on, Kizza said she enjoyed the effect that running has had on her state of mind.
“I think running helps me clear my mind; it’s great for mental health, and it’s nice to leave the Harvard bubble,” Kizza said. “I like that whenever I'm running, I’m not worried about emails or homework or meetings. It’s just time for me to enjoy running.”
Many runners from Harvard qualify to run in the marathon by raising money for charities. Kizza, who raised funds for the American Medical Athletic Association, said she was proud to run for a good cause.
“You fundraise for these organizations, and through fundraising you get to run the Boston Marathon,” Kizza said. “You know that your running is going to contribute to helping others.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the most recent wave of activism at the Law School, some students are calling on the school to eliminate tuition completely as part of their new campaign for financial justice.
Members of the group Reclaim Harvard Law published an open letter Sunday addressed to Law School Dean Martha L. Minow and members of the Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—demanding an end to tuition.
The demand is the cornerstone of “Fees Must Fall,” a campaign activists launched several weeks ago during the Law School’s admitted students weekend. The initiative marks a new focus on economic issues in their movement for better treatment of minorities at the Law School, after activists successfully advocated for the school to remove its controversial seal. 
“[The seal change] is a great symbolic gesture, but we wanted to make sure that there are concrete economic steps that are taken so that students of color and students from low income backgrounds are less marginalized,” Reclaim Harvard Law member Sarah B. Cohen said. “This is aligned with our racial justice goals and a natural continuation of our activism.”
Tuition at the Law School this year is $57,200 and will rise to $59,550 for the 2016-2017 academic year. Students in the Law School's Class of 2015 graduated with an average of  $149,754 in debt, according to the Law School’s website.
The letter claims that high costs disproportionately impact students of color, who “are less likely to have amassed wealth in the United States.” The expense deters many from entering the Law School in the first place, and compels those who do attend to opt for high-paying careers in corporate law to pay off their loans, activists wrote.
Law School spokesperson Robb London wrote in an email that the school “is deeply committed to expanding access to the best students regardless of their backgrounds, and to providing aid to those who need it.”
Eighty percent of J.D. students receive some form of grant or loan aid, according to London. In the letter, however, activists argue that financial aid and the Low Income Protection Plan—a program that helps relieve the debt burdens of graduates who go into public service—are not enough.
They propose that the Law School do away with tuition entirely, and tentatively suggest that the school use its endowment or cut costs—including faculty salaries—to cover any resulting shortfalls. But the letter stopped short of recommending concrete alternatives to tuition.
“The problem with us making a very concrete suggestion is that there is not complete transparency in the Law School’s budget,” Cohen said. “Nor do we think that the burden should be on us as students to come up with that.”
London wrote in an email that the school relies on tuition and other sources of funding to cover costs. Legal restrictions regulating the endowment’s use would make drawing on the endowment difficult, London said, and budget cuts would not be sustainable.
“Such cuts would force us to scale back or even eliminate our clinical programs, and would quickly hamper our ability to attract top-flight faculty and students, and to innovate and lead in legal education,” London wrote.
Activists declined to describe what the Fees Must Fall campaign will entail, but said they are planning to expand the initiative.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 19, 2016, at 1:23 a.m.
When a leader from Harvard’s most reclusive final club spoke out publicly for the first time in decades, reporters across the globe jumped on the story.
Last week, Graduate President of the Porcellian Club Charles M. Storey ’82 issued a statement to The Crimson broadly criticizing the College’s pressure on the unrecognized final clubs to adopt gender neutral membership policies. 
But what drew much attention from outside media outlets was one particularly controversial statement that suggested “[f]orcing single gender organizations to accept members of the opposite sex could potentially increase, not decrease the potential for sexual misconduct.”
The morning after the news broke, the Washington Post ran its own version of the story, featuring an interview with the Fly Club’s graduate president and also detailing the history of Harvard’s traditionally all-male and exclusive social organizations. Soon to follow were the New York Times, the Boston Globe, the Wall Street Journal, and Mic, who interviewed U.S. Vice President Joseph R. Biden on the subject of Harvard’s final clubs.
After The Crimson reported on the statement, the Washington Post “tried to build [its story] around it to include more of the history of the club and make the issues more intelligible to general readers who might not even know what a final club is,” Justin Moyer, a Washington Post reporter who covered Storey's initial statement, wrote in an email.
Moyer added that Harvard’s prestige also made the controversy ripe for the national spotlight.
“Everyone is interested in Harvard,” he said.
Boston.com, an online outlet owned by Boston Globe Media, aggregated content from The Crimson and the Washington Post in order to turn around a story soon after.
“We also looked a little bit in the Boston Globe’s archives and they had stories about the Porcellian Club from the 1940s and 1930s, more for a good background than anything else,” Eric Levenson, one of the website’s writers, said.
The Wall Street Journal editorial staff criticized Harvard administrators for attempting to curb final clubs’ influence. In their staff editorial, the paper cited a meeting Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana held with final club leaders in which he floated the possibility of issuing a sanction against undergraduates involved in clubs.  The editorial called such a measure a “political purge,” and condemned administrators for banning “students from governing their own social lives.”
When asked for comment, Bret Stephens, the Wall Street Journal’s deputy editorial page editor, wrote, “[t]he editorial speaks for itself.”
In September, the Spee drew attention from national media outlets after the club chose to invite women to participate in its punch process, becoming the first of eight traditionally all-male final clubs to consider women. The Fox, another final club, also drew attention after its graduate board shut down the club weeks after the club’s undergraduate leaders invited women to punch.
Like previous stories on the Spee and the Fox, the Porcellian Club story attracted media interest in part because it involved issues of sexual assault and an exclusive college social organization—topics under scrutiny at other college campuses.
“It touches on a lot of issues college campuses are dealing with and many liberal educators are dealing with,” Levenson said. “‘Secretive Exclusive Group Breaks Silence to Talk About Sexual Assault’—every word in that headline makes you go ‘oh my god, that’s a story.’”

World-famous theoretical cosmologist Stephen W. Hawking discussed the history of and recent breakthroughs in research on black holes at the inauguration of Harvard's Black Hole Initiative in Sanders Theatre on Monday afternoon.
Interspersing jokes throughout his lecture, Hawking discussed the implications of recent developments demonstrating that the size of black holes may indicate how much information they hold and that they also emit thermal radiation.
“The message of this lecture is that black holes ain’t as black as they are painted,” Hawking said. “So, if you feel you are in a black hole, don’t give up. There is a way out.”
In addition to serving as the inauguration of Harvard’s Black Hole Initiative, an interdisciplinary program designed specifically to research black holes, Hawking’s talk celebrated the 100th anniversary of the publication of Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity.
According to Chair of the Harvard Department of Astronomy Avi Loeb, who introduced Hawking at the event, the Black Hole Initiative will bring him together with five other scholars, including Astronomy lecturer Sheperd S. Doeleman, History of Science professor Peter L. Galison, natural sciences professor Ramesh Narayan, and Physics professor Andrew Strominger.
Loeb, who serves as the founding director of the Black Hole Initiative, said the organization’s uniqueness ultimately drew Hawking to provide the inaugural lecture.
“The goal is to bring these people together that otherwise do not meet very often and to cultivate a sort of culture of people interested in black holes,” Loeb said. “It’s the only center worldwide that is focused on research on black holes and because of that, Stephen Hawking made it a special priority to come here.”
According to Loeb, space has already been allocated for the Black Hole Initiative on 20 Garden St., but he is waiting for the funding application to be approved in the coming weeks.
Once approved, Loeb hopes the initiative will host student programs that would give undergraduates and graduate students the opportunity to participate in workshops and contribute to research on black holes.
Andrew W. Mayo ’17, a Physics and Astrophysics concentrator, lauded Hawking for his dynamic presentation.
“There are not a lot of lecturers who are able to keep the audience engaged,” he said. “This was one of those lectures that was able to do that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Police arrested Harvard Law professor and former presidential candidate Lawrence Lessig last week during protests focused on campaign finance reform in Washington, D.C.
Organized by the nonpartisan group Democracy Spring, a movement dedicated to campaign finance reform and supporting disadvantaged voters, the week-long sit-in protest in the nation’s capital came in the midst of this election cycle's primary season.
“We are seeing all this money being poured into what is by far the most expensive election in our nation’s history,” Peter J. Callahan, a spokesperson for Democracy Spring, said.
“This money has a very corrupting influence on our democracy and we believe that until we get rid of big money and make sure everyone has a right to vote that we will not be able to have a full, healthily functioning democracy,” Callahan said.
Among the thousands who participated in last week’s sit-ins or the previous week’s march to Washington from Philadelphia, were celebrities including actress Rosario Dawson and radio commentator Jim Hightower, Callahan said.
The U.S. Capitol Police made about 1,240 arrests in total over the course of the week-long protest, according to an agency press release. Individuals arrested had to pay a fine for “unlawful demonstration activities” and were released.
Lessig, who could not be reached for comment, was among those arrested last week. A former presidential candidate for the 2016 election, the Law School professor had stressed during his campaign the need for finance reform. Lessig ended his campaign in November after failing to earn a spot in Democratic presidential debates.
“We have not embraced the fundamental fact that we need to change the way campaigns are funded,” Lessig said in an interview with the Young Turks posted over the weekend. “We need to spend public money on campaigns because whoever funds campaigns gets to call the tune.”
Lessig’s arrest last week was his first, revealing his dedication to the movement, Callahan argued. “I’m a law professor,” Lessig said in an interview with USA Today. “I don’t get arrested.”
Callahan expressed gratitude for Lessig’s support for the movement and praised his willingness to participate in the protests with “many other brave individuals.”
Democracy Spring will continue its movement for the rest of the election season, with a focus on meeting with congressmen and constituents, and passing legislation that would encourage more small contributions to presidential candidates. Callahan stressed the importance of a calm but meaningful protest.
“We are going to continue to show the poise and grace that all our participants have shown, whether in marches or sit-ins,” Callahan said. “This will definitely not be the last you see of this ‘movement’ movement.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Storm Troopers, Wookies, and Star Wars fans gathered to watch actress Carrie Fisher receive the Humanist Hub's Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural Humanism in Memorial Church on Monday evening.
A standing ovation and the “Imperial March” greeted Fisher as she accepted the award. She addressed the full church with jokes and Star Wars quotations, along with remarks on mental illness, therapy, celebrity, body image, and religion.
Speaking of her experience as someone with bipolar disorder, Fisher said, “What is vital is having a community. If you can find some people who have the same thing you do, it can be a lot easier than wandering around alone.”
The Humanist Hub founded the annual award in 2007, with Salman Rushdie as their first recipient. Other honorees have included Seth MacFarlane, Stephen Fry, and Mythbuster’s Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman.
The Hub’s Program Director Sarah J. Chandonnet said the Hub works with the students of the Harvard Community of Humanists, Atheists, and Agnostics each year to nominate a candidate for the award.
Chandonnet said the humanist groups chose Fisher because of her openness about agnosticism and mental illness. Fisher has talked about her own experiences with drug addiction, bipolar disorder, and religion both onscreen and in her published writings. 
“We think it is very important that she is in Star Wars, but I think what’s more important is the way that she has used her celebrity to talk about values and to talk about things that are hard,” Chandonnet said. “[The award is] for people who have used their celebrity to uphold the values that the Humanist Hub represents.”
Fisher also fielded questions from audience members on a variety of topics, which included her work on the Star Wars films, mental illness treatment, and acting.
Addressing her honesty about her experience with bipolar disorder, Fisher said, “I would rather have my version of mental illness than anyone else’s.”
Attendees expressed excitement about the event and Fisher’s humorous approach to traditionally stigmatized topics.
“I’m a huge fan. I really wanted to see Carrie Fisher because she’s such an advocate for mental health,” Elsie A. Tellier ’19 said.
Other audience members enjoyed Fisher’s bluntness and comedy.
“It was really refreshing to have someone speak so candidly and humorously about real life,” HCHAA member August E. Stover ’18 said.
Originally established in 1974 as the Humanist Chaplaincy at Harvard, the Humanist Hub is an organization serving local humanists, agnostics, and atheists. In addition to this award, the Hub coordinates speaker series, discussion groups, and the popular Harry Potter as a Sacred Text reading group.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Four seniors have been selected to speak at the Class of 2016’s Class Day festivities, the Senior Class Committee announced on Monday.
Mariam H. Jalloul ’16 and Min-Woo S. Park ’16 were chosen to deliver the traditionally more serious and reflective speeches. Aaron I. Henricks ’16 and Christina M. Teodorescu ’16 will be delivering the typically lighter-hearted orations.
The four speeches were chosen from a pool of over 80 applications, Class Marshal Irfan Mahmud ’16 said. The committee chose the four orators based on criteria including content, delivery, and presentation.
Fellow Class Marshall Gabriela D.M. Ruiz-Colón ’16 said the committee looked for speeches that could appeal to the majority of the Class of 2016.
“We definitely wanted to go for a set of four speeches that resonated with a wide swath of the class, so we didn’t want to privilege one Harvard experience over another,” she said. “Because everyone does Harvard differently, and our class has so many different Harvard experiences, so resonation was one of the things we really looked for.”
The speakers themselves gathered on the steps of Tercentenary Theater on Monday, a little more than a month before their speeches are set to be delivered, to preview their planned talks.
Jalloul said that she and a lot of her classmates define success by “external things and what we can put on our resumes.”
“So [my speech] is really about challenging that and looking at the successes that were often invisible but were often such a driving force in our experiences here at Harvard,” she said.
Henricks proclaimed broader aspirations for his own speech, with a smile.
“My speech is about the future of the Class of 2016,” he said. “I wouldn’t be surprised if people left totally transformed, totally new people.”
Park spoke a little more seriously about his own speech.
“While I was writing this speech, I wanted to avoid as many grand, sweeping generalizations as possible,” he said. “So this is a speech about a very personal narrative, and I just hope that it can resonate with my fellow classmates as well.”
Teodorescu echoed Park’s sentiment. “I tried to avoid making sweeping generalizations about what that might mean for everyone, but instead presenting my own as an example and trying to allay concerns about the real world that I share with a lot of my peers,” she said.
“I’d like to add that I speak almost exclusively in sweeping generalizations,” Henricks said in response. “Every sentence is one of those.”
The Class Day ceremony, which traditionally takes place the day before Commencement every year, falls on May 25 this year.
All four speakers said they were delighted to find that they had been chosen to speak in front of their classes.
“I shared that elation and excitement, but I think I’ve also been vacillating wildly between that and sheer terror—like pretty consistently over the past week,” Teodorescu said. “So hopefully on class day we end up with excitement again.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Behind a slew of strong starts, the Harvard men’s baseball team (12-19, 5-7 Ivy) began intra-divisional play with three wins out of four against rival Yale in New Haven, Conn.
The Crimson allowed just nine runs over the four games against their Red Rolfe Division rivals, pulling within two games of the Bulldogs (12-22-1, 7-5 Ivy) at the top of the divisional summit.
“To travel to Yale and feel like we played up to our potential and get three out of four wins was huge for us,” captain Matt Sanders said. “They are must-win games, and the hitters came out and swung the bats well, and in certain situations the guys came out and pitched incredibly well.”
Harvard made a few lineup changes against their archrivals, with freshman center fielder Ben Skinner’s move to the leadoff position chief among them. Skinner, second on the team with five stolen bases, went 4-for-13 with three runs scored and an RBI over the weekend.
“A lot of [the change] had to do with Ben Skinner’s hot bat,” senior second baseman Mitch Klug said. “He’s definitely one of the fastest guys in the lineup, so any time you can get speed at the top of the lineup it’s a bonus.”
Klug, sophomore third baseman John Fallon, and sophomore infielder Matt Rothenberg had five hits apiece to lead the team.
HARVARD 5, YALE 2
The Crimson’s bats combined for a season-high 15 hits to close out the weekend, with Klug and Rothenberg each picking up three. Freshman righty Kevin Stone allowed just two runs over four innings while senior southpaw Shaun Rubin threw three and one-third scoreless innings to earn the victory.
“Everyone coming out of the bullpen felt like they could get the job done,” Sanders said, “but for whatever reason had struggled a little bit earlier in the season. But now we have guys… who are coming out of the pen and shutting the door.”
Harvard jumped on Bulldogs starter Chris Lanham in the top of the first, riding three singles and a double to three early runs. The Crimson wouldn’t look back from there, scoring a run in the second and the fourth to take a commanding lead.
HARVARD 9, YALE 1
The Crimson offense put in a productive performance Sunday morning to back impressive junior right-hander Ian Miller, who held the Bulldogs to just one run over seven innings to earn his first victory of the season.
Harvard had as many runs as hits in the game, with Fallon and juniors Drew Reid and Josh Ellis, hitting 8th and 9th respectively, all driving in a pair of runs.
“Any time you get hits from the bottom of the lineup you’re going to put some runs on the board and really turn things around,” Klug said. “This weekend, specifically, the guys who kind of had to be at the bottom of the lineup stepped up and did a really good job stepping up and getting big hits when we needed it.”
The Crimson scored two in the first and four in the fourth to take control of proceedings, with Yale’s only run coming in the bottom of the seventh as a late consolation.
HARVARD 6, YALE 3
The Crimson rode the reliable right arm of senior starter Sean Poppen to a rebound victory on Saturday night, benefitting from pass balls on successive at-bats during its decisive four-run eighth inning.
Poppen allowed three runs, two earned, over seven innings while striking out seven.
“From a defensive standpoint, it’s always great to play behind guys who are filling it up, throwing great, and have a lot of confidence on the mound,” Klug said. “We played some good defense behind them, and we gave them some support, and that’s the most important thing.”
Harvard trailed, 3-2, heading into the eighth but passed balls and RBIs from freshman first baseman Pat McColl and Rothenberg tipped the scales back in the visitor’s balance.
YALE 3, HARVARD 2
Shaky defense and cold bats doomed the Crimson to a weekend-opening loss on Saturday afternoon, 3-2, against the Bulldogs. Junior right-hander Nick Gruener hurled his fifth consecutive complete game, striking out five in six innings of three-run ball. None of the runs were earned.
“I think any time Nick’s out on the mound, we’re definitely putting ourselves in a position to win,” Klug said. “The defense loves to play behind him, he always pitches well.”
That defense, however, committed three errors, with the errors leading to all three runs. Reid and freshman left fielder Trent Bryan drove in Harvard’s runs, but a throwing error in the fifth inning by Fallon ended up being the difference between the sides.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

The Harvard softball team spent its weekend in New Haven, picking up three wins in four games against Ivy rival Yale. The Crimson shut out the Bulldogs in its last matchup, 6-0, after a weekend of closely contested tilts. Harvard has now won nine of its last 10 games.
“We definitely have a large portion of our underclassmen stepping up,” junior Jillian Leslie said.
HARVARD 2, YALE 0
A scoreless seven innings for both the Crimson (20-14, 9-3 Ivy) and the Bulldogs (12-26, 5-7) forced the first game of the weekend into extra innings. Harvard broke through with two runs in the top of the eighth to win it.
Strong pitching by both teams highlighted the matchup. Captain Morgan Groom gave up only five hits over all eight innings she threw, picking up her sixth win of the year.
Yale had scoring opportunities in the bottom of the sixth and the seventh, with base runners in scoring position in both of these late innings.
Groom ended Bulldog hopes by inducing a ground out in the sixth and a pop up and ground out in the seventh to end the innings.
Crimson bats came alive in the eighth with Senior Haley Davis leading off with a single. At the next at bat Junior Giana Panariello doubled to deep center field to send Davis home for the first RBI of the day.
Captain Zoe Galindo laid down a sacrifice bunt to move Panariello to third and freshman Rhianna Rich ripped her own double to center, allowing Panariello to score and advancing Harvard to 2-0 to secure the win.
HARVARD 5, YALE 4
The second game on Saturday was a close bout with another full game pitched by a Crimson pitcher. Junior Taylor Cabe improved to 11-3 on the mound thanks to a three run rally in the fifth to clinch the game.
“Especially on Saturday we played with a lot of grit. The first game was decided by extra innings and the second was decided by one run,” Groom said. “I think we really pushed hard every single inning to play the best that we could.”
The Bulldogs put a run an inning on the board for the first four, but Harvard was able to cut their lead in half in the bottom of the fourth with RBIs from  Panariello and Davis.
Junior Catherine Callaway started off the inning with a triple down the right field line and scored after Panariello followed suit with a triple of her own.
The momentum continued into the fifth with Rich hitting a solo homer, her second home run of the season, to close the gap to one. Classmate Meagan Lantz then launched the ball over the centerfield wall for a two-run homer to put Harvard in the lead 5-4.
Cabe and the Crimson defense let up only one hit for the last two innings to lock up the win and sweep the day.
YALE 1, HARVARD 0
Harvard dropped its first and only game of the series to Yale despite a solid performance by Groom on the mound, as the Crimson ultimately wasted several scoring opportunities
Groom and the Crimson defense gave up no hits for the first five innings, but the Bulldogs were able to break through in the sixth with two hits and a run scored. Yale’s Allison Skinner doubled to right center with two outs to drive the winning run home. Harvard was unable to answer back, leaving one runner on base to end the game.
Harvard out-hit their opponents 6-2, but several unsuccessful offensive risks and a total of five runners, including two in scoring position in the sixth, left on the bases stopped them from putting anything on the board.
“Sometimes what our team needs is a reset and we went into that first game and we fought and Yale prevailed,” Leslie said.
HARVARD 6, YALE 0
The Crimson rebounded fast from the close loss earlier in the day to score all six runs of the game in their first at bat and to tallie 14 total hits across the seven innings. Three Harvard pitchers combined to let up only one hit.
“I think that losing that game lit a fire under everyone,” Groom said. “Our offense absolutely wanted to prove that they had something in them and they really came in lights out that first inning of the second game.”
Freshman Kathleen Duncan pitched the first win of her collegiate career and classmates Nicki Nishizawa and Sarah Smith relieved her in the seventh.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Branden Clemens, the captain, senior outside hitter, and top attacker of the Harvard men’s volleyball team is a big guy.
He stands 6’6” and weighs nearly 200 lbs., making him roughly the size of Houston Rockets guard James Harden. In a sport that selects for supersized proportions, only one Crimson player—freshman middle blocker Trevor Dow—is significantly taller.
And when Clemens skies for a block, those dimensions seem to stretch even larger. Frozen in beanpole straightness as his armpit scrapes the eight-foot net, he might as well be a giant.
He’s a big guy. It should be no surprise that he fills up big stages.
This weekend, in a pair of matches against Princeton and NJIT, Harvard experienced what were likely the biggest stages of the year.
At stake was a whole season—or, if you prefer to go further back, four whole seasons of sweaty work. Back-to-back victories over the Tigers and the Highlanders would give the Crimson a spot in the four-team EIVA playoffs.
Two losses, or even a lone loss to NJIT, would end the year.
It was with this knowledge that Clemens laced up his shoes on Friday night. And it was with this knowledge that he unlaced them roughly 24 hours later, newly minted as a 2016 playoff contender.
“We’re a team that deserves to be in the playoffs,” Clemens said. “It’s incredible that we clinched. I’m just so happy about it.”
In both contests, Clemens—who played every second of every point—led decisive sequences that erased deficits.
Against the Tigers, the score stood at 9-8 in the second set when Clemens rose for his first jump serve. Harvard clutched a 1-0 set lead, but an early-game run by Princeton had the hosts playing catch-up.
The Crimson caught up soon enough. Over the next nine points, Clemens unloaded the longest service run of the weekend. He recorded two aces, forced two Tigers timeouts, and created an insurmountable lead. Harvard didn’t trail for the rest of the night.
The streak came on a night when Clemens led all attacking players with 10 kills and a .667 hitting percentage. Half of these finishes came in the clinching third game.
By the way, he also tied for the Harvard lead with four block assists.
The performance had teammates such as sophomore setter Marko Kostich waxing nostalgic.
“The last two games were entirely played for our seniors,” Kostich said. “We really emphasized that in the locker room.”
Yet the next night’s performance was arguably more impressive. Earlier in the season, NJIT had squeaked by the Crimson in five sets, and the hosts needed to reverse that result in order to extend the season.
Midway through the fourth set, the two programs seemed headed for another tiebreaker duel, as the Highlanders had come back from a two-set deficit to lead 10-6 in the fourth.
If momentum had ever existed, it was wearing blue-and-red at that moment.
“Knowing it was my last match here I wanted to give it my all,” Clemens said. “I have nothing left to lose, so I wanted to give it my all.”
On this night, giving it his all meant recording five kills over the next seven points. It was a remarkable one-man performance, and it dragged the Crimson to a 12-11 lead.
Even as he topped all players with 18 finishes, Clemens also posted a .343 kill rate, which was higher than any NJIT player with more than three attacks.
Later in the final frame, Clemens showcased his defensive skills by skidding across the floor for a deep dig. Play continued, Harvard eventually claimed the point, and Clemens came up yelling. Even if you were wearing mufflers, it was possible to lip-read his words: “Let’s go, boys.”
The boys went, sure enough. All it took was a six-point service run by Kostich (partly aided by another Clemens kill), and the Crimson took the match. For another weekend, the team’s season—and Clemens’ career—lived on.
As Kostich explained, there was a satisfying karma to the final result.
“We owe [the seniors] the world,” Kostich said. “They showed us around when we were high-schoolers…. We’re kind of repaying them now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 58 Harvard women’s tennis team (12-10, 2-4 Ivy) finished the weekend with a win and then a loss against Ancient Eight opponents No. 69 Yale (8-12, 2-4) and No. 72 Brown (14-10, 2-4), respectively.
Coming off its first Ivy win last week, a 4-3 tilt over Princeton, the Crimson looked to have a winning a streak going in New Haven on Friday afternoon before getting back to Cambridge only to lose at the hands of Brown on Sunday.
HARVARD 6, YALE 1
The pair of sophomore Annika Ringblom and freshman Sabrina Xiong put the Crimson on the front foot with a strong 6-2 performance in doubles. After a loss at No. 3 doubles, the No. 1 pair of junior June Lee and freshman Erica Oosterhout capped the crucial doubles point with a tightly contested win, 7-5.
The singles play was less contested than doubles play. Besides Lee’s loss, the Crimson won all other matches and went back to Cambridge with a resounding 6-1 win. Freshman Nikki Kallenberg, Oosterhout, Ringblom, Xiong and senior Amy He all won in straight sets.
The win improved the team's away record to 5-3 on the year.
“We always play a lot better as a visiting team,” Ringblom said.
The win extended the team's total to 12 on the year, five more than the squad's final tally last season.
BROWN 4, HARVARD 3
After one day of rest, the Crimson was back at it against Brown at the Beren Tennis Center on Sunday afternoon.
In the doubles contest, Ringblom and Xiong were beaten 6-0. After freshman Isabel Jasper and Kallenberg won 6-3, it was up to Oosterhout and Lee to win the doubles point for Harvard. But the pair lost, 7-6, handing the early advantage to the Bears.
After winning the doubles point, Brown simply needed to split the remaining six singles matches. Oosterhout, Ringlblom and He would all win in straight sets, but Lee, Kallenberg and Xiong would all suffer defeats handing Brown the match with a 4-3 score.
With the loss, Harvard remains winless at home in Ivy League competition.
“I think that we're doing pretty well at this point in the season,” Xiong said.“We could definitely be doing better, but every match we lost was 3-4 and could have gone either way.”
Harvard's last four losses have all come by a score of 4-3. In three of those matchups, the doubles point was the deciding factor.

Dear Prefrosh,
You’ve had your Visitas weekend, got your free drawstring backpack, slept on a common room couch, heard about Harvard’s courses and extracurricular activities, and maybe got a taste of Harvard’s bumping social scene. Now it’s time to make your decision.
Maybe you need pictures of Gothic architecture for Instagram, and you’re drawn to an odd village called New Haven.  Maybe ever since watching High School Musical 3, you’ve been idealizing that West Coast college life.  Maybe you want to be close to home because you don’t know how to do laundry (or maybe because you will just miss your family).
Whatever is causing you to be undecided, take it from us: Harvard is your top choice.
Here’s why:
1. Getting to eat in the Great Hall at Hogwarts: Harvard’s freshman get to eat in Annenberg Hall, which is basically the Great Hall in Hogwarts. Yale’s dining hall looks like Durmstrang’s, and who even goes there?
2. The Harvard Square Turkey: Harvard’s unofficial mascot (because what is a Crimson) is a turkey.  A physical live turkey that can be found roaming Harvard Yard and the streets around it. There’s nothing quite like running into a turkey on your way to class. Your other choice’s mascot animal 1) probably isn’t alive and just can’t compete.
3. Lowell Tea: Lowell Tea is what your friends envision social life at Harvard to be.  Every Thursday, live out your inner Princess Diana and sip tea out of porcelain teacups and eat pastries. You’ll be sad at any other school when your classiest teatime experience is drinking Lipton out of a take-out paper dixie cup.
4. Tourists: Not everyone gets to go to school in a tourist attraction.  Nothing makes you feel more special than waking up and looking out your window to see 30 tourists taking hundreds of photos of your building. Competing for sidewalk space is just too great an experience to give up to go to your other, quiet, isolated school.
5. Primal Scream: Nothing says tradition like taking your clothes off and screaming in Harvard Yard the night before final exams! Even if you don’t do it, there’s nothing quite like pausing your studying to see a naked mob run a lap outside your window. Other schools’ traditions include chugging 15 cups of espresso and pulling three consecutive all-nighters, but that’s just not fun without the chance to get naked too.
There you have it—loud and clear—Harvard is unequivocally your top choice.  See you in the fall.
Love,
Flyby

Harvard students have been abuzz since the announcement that Steve Aoki will be the artist performing at this year’s Yardfest. The popular electro-house musician is well known for his collaborations with artists such as Lil Jon, Afrojack, and will.i.am, as well as remixes of popular songs by artists such as Kid Cudi.
But in typical Yardfest fashion, booked artists have been out of the limelight for a few years. So, what has Aoki been up to recently?
In 2012, Aoki’s popularity peaked with the success of the movie Project X. His remix of Cudi’s song, “Pursuit of Happiness,” helped the movie clinch a nomination for best music at the MTV Movie Awards. Since then, it appears Aoki’s popularity has been on the decline. A simple Google Trends search of his name reveals that since 2013, the number of Google searches of his name have been decreasing.
It appears that in 2013, Aoki was doing a lot of collaborations with artists ranging from Linkin Park, Diplo, and Deorro. While Aoki wasn’t releasing new albums, he was creating tracks that were used in various movies and commercials. His collaboration with Linkin Park, “A Light That Never Comes,” was featured in Expendables 3. Curiously, he also appeared in an anti-fur advertisement for PETA.
In 2014 and 2015, Aoki reemerged as a major player in the electronic music scene, appearing in nearly 100 concerts all over the world. Several of his songs were featured in the movies Step Up: All In and 22 Jump Street. In September of 2014, Aoki released his new album “Neon Future I,” which reached No. 32 on the Billboard 200. His most popular song from the album, “Delirious,” can still be heard blasting on Mt. Auburn some weekends. You probably heard it over the radio since it was played every five seconds, or maybe in one of the numerous Scion commercials featuring Aoki.
Aoki also made the news in 2015 when he announced a change to his cake policy. One of the hallmarks of his concerts has been that he would take a cake and throw it into the crowd. Now, Aoki says he will only throw cake at crowds at headline shows and a few other select venues.
The highly awaited documentary by Justin Krook of Aoki’s life and his rise to fame, I’ll Sleep When I’m Dead, premiered last Friday night at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York at the Beacon Theatre.
While Aoki has been pretty low-key for a few years, he is again ramping up excitement for his high energy shows and his 2015 performances have often been dubbed “awesome” and “amazing” by concert goers. Thus, Aiko’s up-tempo songs and performances should create quite a lively atmosphere at Yardfest, so let’s all get ready to be awed! And who knows, maybe it’ll be you who gets caked in the face.

Good news: Pfoho residents are using condoms! Bad news: They've been disposing of said condoms by... throwing them out the window?
Yeah, you read that right. There is at least one person living in Pfoho that has repeatedly thrown their condoms out of their windows once they've gotten laid.
Seriously, who even does this kind of thing? Invest in a trash can, bro.
From an email sent to Pfoho students by Mario Leon, Pfoho Building Manager: “It has come to my attention that used condoms have been found on the ground and hanging from the tree outside next to the Comstock Hall entrance. I have been told by the landscapers working around the building as well as other Pfoho residents that this continues to be a problem.”
“This is very inappropriate and disrespectful to the people who contribute to our community by working hard to maintain the property,” Leon said. “It is also disgusting for anyone who may see a used condom when they look out their window.”
So, from us at Flyby to you, offending Pfoho student(s): this is absolutely revolting. Sure, some Houses are going through rough times with students leaving dirty dishes in hallways and such, but this is on an entirely new level. Do better, Pfoho. Do better.
Sections
With only a little over a week left of class, you’re running out of time to take that relationship with your section crush to the next level. Not to fear! Flyby has some advice to make the most out of your last few days of the semester.
Coffee If you haven’t had the guts to talk to your crush all semester, now is your chance! For those of us that prefer to be more casual, coffee straddles that perfect line between classmate and friend. You’ve probably been looking for the perfect string of words to woo your crush for weeks. Of course you know that you could just ask that one to grab Crema with you after class, but that would be too logical.
LunchKeep it simple, tell your crush that you want to grab a meal with them. However, with no Panera, Al’s, or Au Bon Pain, your options are going to be pretty limited as far as sandwiches go. We’ve heard HUDS serves a mean Crispy Fish sandwich on Tuesdays. If the dining hall isn’t really your scene, there’s always an awkward conversation to be had in Greenhouse Cafe while you run down your BoardPlus, before you lose Greenhouse forever.
Study BuddyWith finals rapidly approaching, your section crush is going to need someone to study with for that exam. We’ve heard that the basement of  Lamont makes a great first date location to hammer out those readings together. The Widener stacks are also rumored to be a good spot, but some might take that to be a little too forward.
Section Crush is your TFToo bad. Not only are they tired of grading your mediocre work, but they’re also tired of watching you daydream while they teach. Our advice? Wait until the semester is over. It will be much less awkward to chat them up once they are no longer responsible for your grade. 
Hope for next semester? Chances are that if you’re in section once, you can probably find another class with them again. Hey, isn’t that what shopping week is for?
Bottom line, our advice at Flyby is “Go for it!” With only a few more days, what’s the worst that could happen? Your section crush probably won’t say no (unless you’re “section kid,” of course.) And even if they do, you’ll be able to spend all of reading period hiding in your room from the shame, and you won’t even have to skip class to do it.
