After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Anne Tyler’s “A Spool of Blue Thread,” the 20th novel by the Pultizer Prize-winning author, is loaded with ideas and potentially fascinating storylines that are extended throughout the book but somehow not given proper closure. Four generations of an American family, the Whitshanks, are depicted in its pages, where each person contributes to the intricate web of secrets at the novel’s center. Tyler uses multiple points of view and chronological variations in developing her characters, and in doing so she seems to take after the philosophy expressed by Abby Whitshank, the mother, who asks at one point, “Why select just a few stories to benefit yourself?” But the novel, an otherwise enjoyable book, suffers from this decision.
The tone of the novel is split between two opposing perspectives on death and human relationships, which gives Tyler a compositional challenge she does not fully meet. Specifically, Abby is in constant conflict with her husband Red. Red’s parents died when their car stalled on railroad tracks, prompting Red and Abby to realize that they see the end of life differently. Abby’s problem with death is precisely “that you don’t get to see how everything turns out. You won’t know the ending.” She longs for prolonged goodbyes. By contrast, Red believes in letting things play themselves out in an instantaneous ending. Their argument carries through the rest of the novel and affects other aspects of their lives, making a lively tension that could have been an opportunity for Tyler to draw unusual connections between character and plot.
But Tyler’s efforts to reflect the theme of these two contrasting attitudes, in the form of the book, stretches too thin. Some threads go on almost endlessly, perhaps reflecting Abby’s perspective, and Tyler fails to end them clearly. Even by the end, many characters’ lives continue onwards in a sporadic fashion that leaves the reader uncertain of where the Whitshanks are actually going to settle in their lives. Just as disappointingly, other parts of the book wrap up abruptly without providing much of a storyline to begin with, which may represent Red’s philosophy of endings. Even though the book opens with Denny telling his father that he’s gay, for example, this is never actually explored and is almost entirely dropped. No matter how closely one reads, it is never obvious whether Denny was telling the truth about being gay, or, if not, what his motives were for telling his father in the first place. Tyler’s clumsy and inefficient plotting is unsatisfying and leads to vague conclusions.
Although Tyler develop her characters is greater detail in the book’s middle section, they remain unapproachably abstract at the story’s close. Abby and her nomadic son Denny stand to be the most complex people, but even they fall flat. The one bit of information learned about Denny is that he fears being “stuck in his family, trapped...ingrown, like a toenail,” which explains why he dislikes his mother’s intrusions in his life. Many events over the course of the novel accordingly focus on his disappearance and reappearance, yet Tyler fails to provide conclusions and proper backstories to Denny’s behavior. Similarly, Abby’s storyline lacks intrigue outside of her role as a secret keeper. Abby is more interested in the stories of others than in developing one of her own: whether it’s the constant invitation of strangers to family dinners or her irritation at her children confiding in one another instead of her, Abby lacks her own motivation and does not develop as a character outside of the people who confide in her. Tyler does not flesh out her background until the end, but the matriarch’s passive portrayal continues to lack depth even after her backstory is fully exposed.
On the other hand, “A Spool of Blue Thread” is still a relatable and amusing book. Although the characters are unfinished, they are three-dimensional in one important way that readers may emphasize with: they have their secrets. The secret behind the adoption of Abby’s son Stem, for example, which Abby hides from the entire family, explains Stem’s anger as well as Denny’s resentment towards his mother, Red’s sense of duty to Stem, and Abby’s overbearing parenting methods. Tyler’s thoughtful depiction of these secrets and their repression creates the image of a complex and unsettled family holding on to one another even while struggling with personal calamities that distance them from each other.
The novel’s most interesting strength is in the parallelism Tyler establishes between the Whitshanks and their family home, the site of their secrets. The house, which was built by Abby’s father-in-law Junior to mark the beginning of the Whitshank family, has its own storyline. Tyler writes that in the house “the wallpaper...was showing its seam too distinctly. In fact, the seam was separating.” This symbol of the characters’ attempts to hide their own true natures emphasizes the strife and weaknesses within the family in a way that fortifies their complex development. The connections illuminated by the interplay of the Whitshanks’ secrets and their life in the house add some depth to the personality of each family member and the group as a whole in a way that almost rescues the novel.
The Whitshank family is entertaining, and a few of its members’ problems are laid out in intricate details which, now and then, contain genuine appeal. Tyler would have benefited from limiting the stories included to just those few. But unfortunately, she spends a good portion of the book stuck in prolonged ending and at the same time the book itself ends too fast. “A Spool of Blue Thread” proves unable to mend Tyler’s disconnected portrait of the entire family.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I use a wheelchair. Like a big, 400 pound, electric wheelchair. I have a disease that causes my muscles to be weak, useless bastards, so I need a wheelchair to get around. There are a ton of other interesting things about me, but they are, tragically, not op-ed worthy.
I've spent my four years at the College reminding myself I chose Harvard. I knew other schools would be more accommodating, accessible, and safe from the possibility of snowpocalypses, and yet I chose Harvard. I have had some amazing experiences during my time here thanks to my A+ friend group, and while nothing can devalue those memories, the Harvard social community is simply restrictive for students with disabilities.
Of the 12 houses, only Quincy, Pforzheimer, and Currier are fully accessible (one can hope renewal will improve this over time), so when the Eliot Cockpit or literally anything in Kirkland is "goin’ up on a Tuesday," I will not be there. In my experience, final clubs as well as fraternity and sorority spaces are not accessible. Remember that awkward moment when I punched the Bee and the second round event was in an inaccessible house, so I had to make up said event by getting awkward lattes with the Bee president, and then I didn’t make it to the next round? Maybe I’m just painfully boring or not as cool as I think I am. Or, you know, Harvard social life is not open to people with disabilities. But I chose Harvard.
Still, I had hope for senior year. We’d have events and senior bars that would bring the class together. The Senior Class Committee is a college-sponsored group, I thought, so there was no way a function wouldn’t be accessible. Ah, to be young and naïve.
Senior Bar at Queenshead: yup, good, crowded, but fully accessible.
Senior Bar at Tasty Burger: Arrive, go to lift, lift is broken. Manager proceeds to get stuck inside the lift in her efforts to fix it. SCC assures me, “We had it checked! It was working fine!” Manager is freed. More efforts to fix the lift are failing. I feel angry and embarrassed at the circus this is causing, and I leave. After many expletives on my end, my friends assure me it was just an ironic and crappy coincidence, and tell me to give the SCC the benefit of the doubt, because after that debacle they will definitely be aware of accessibility when choosing Senior Bar venues.
Senior Bar at Uno's was announced this week. Knowing Uno’s bar is downstairs with no elevator access, I sat for a solid two minutes in confusion upon seeing the news. Did the SCC not bother to remember accessibility, or at this point do they just not care? Posts on the Facebook event reveal that part of the first floor restaurant space has been reserved to make “accommodations.” To me, this translates as, “Well, the real action and atmosphere is downstairs, pretty much everyone will gravitate down there, but we’re just gonna stuff you, your friends, and our other disabled classmates up here next to a family of four trying to enjoy their Chicago-style deep dish. Smile! We’re accommodating you!”
To some, this may seem a touch melodramatic. For me, after four years of navigating the restricted Harvard social climate, further limited by physical boundaries, I’m over it. Yeah, I chose Harvard, but when it comes to college-sponsored class events, I won’t accept excuses for anything that isn’t fully accessible.
Senior Class Committee: If you are using a venue in which all or much of the main space is accessible by stairs only, it isn’t accessible. If lifts or elevators are broken, it isn’t accessible. I have passed on a list of fully accessible venues in the square to the committee. For now, I’ll sit over here patiently awaiting the announcement of the next senior bar, sipping my tea.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Wednesday, I volunteered with a group of Harvard students at the Greater Boston Food Bank, the clearinghouse for over 500 food pantries and soup kitchens in Eastern Massachusetts and the largest food bank in New England. In service to this superlative, the warehouse we entered almost comically evinced the industrial aesthetic. Shrilling beeps announced forklifts moving backwards. Mountainous stacks of cans reflected the fluorescents overhead. “I read somewhere that this is one of the country’s biggest food banks,” I heard someone behind me say. “I’d buy that,” I responded—the proof was in the pudding cups, stacked ceiling-high in one corner.
I was pumped.
This was my chance to address issues in the food system in ways that writing an article every couple weeks couldn’t. The energy of the other volunteer groups—a corporate team from Oracle generous with their time but not with their pizza, a veteran delegation from Datazoom, and the legendary Jimmy whose artistry in packing bread boxes will be celebrated in lore for years to come—showed that my feelings were well-reciprocated. We fed off of each other’s good vibes as we started our first task of packing boxes of bread, further convinced of the difference we were making the higher the pile of boxes grew. Charity makes us uncritical, and we spent the following hours boozed on her effects.
It wasn’t until we moved onto packing boxes of snacks that I sobered up to the real impact of our labor. “Don’t pack any candy,” the woman to my left forewarned me in all seriousness, lest I compromise the dietary value of the sugar cookies, potato chips, and Ritz crackers already in my box. I started feeling like shit—because that’s what we’re feeding our nation’s poor. By failing to meet the basic nutritional needs of a population already paradoxically burned by both hunger and obesity, food banks perpetuate the very issues they aim to solve.
Food banks provide a simple solution for a complex problem, bred from a simple conception of hunger taken out of the complex issue of food security. Hunger is merely a matter of caloric intake, which can be as effectively alleviated by KitKats as it can by kale. Food security, alternatively, characterizes the sufficient and reliable availability of nutritionally adequate food without having to sacrifice other basic needs. It means a mother doesn’t have to feed her kids hot dogs and Sour Patches for a week because that’s all that the food bank has. One in six Americans is food insecure, a statistic that has only worsened throughout and covertly because of our 50-year experiment in food banking.
Logic dictates a pretty intuitive solution, one that modifies but ultimately salvages food banking: People should donate healthier food. What the monopoly of store-brand white hamburger buns and ethnic Christmas cookies in last Wednesday’s box packaging operation illustrates, however, is the unhealthy dependency of our nation’s hunger relief system on large-scale corporate donations. Supermarkets and manufacturers donate to food banks the items they can’t sell—often unhealthy junk that customers know better than to buy. Corporations get tax breaks and good PR, and food banks get a critically larger and more warehouse-friendly inventory. Both get illusory visions of progress in the misguided fight against “hunger.”
The problem may very well be in the demand as much as the supply. There’s a solid case to be made that despite Farm Bill subsidies and industrial cost reduction, it’s feasible to eat a nutritious meal on a budget. However, these arguments don’t account for other costs that make food banks and drive-thrus cheaper and more convenient: the opportunity cost of preparing fresh food for parents juggling multiple jobs, transportation costs and the general inaccessibility of healthy food in food deserts, and the costs and unaffordable hassle of preserving fresh food, just to name a few. Food banks accommodate the food insecure with a counterproductive coping strategy—79 percent of food bank patrons purchase the unhealthy but cheap and convenient food that’s available at their fingertips.
The illogical, counterintuitive solution to food insecurity, then, is ingenuity in the face of habitual mediocrity. In the Greater Boston area, the organization Food for Free rescues prepared fare from restaurants or campuses like ours that otherwise goes to waste, and delivers it to homes and local food pantries. Gleaners harvest unmarketable or surplus produce from farms to supply soup kitchens. And while only members currently enjoy the products of Boston’s League of Urban Canners, the idea of sourcing fruits and vegetables growing in public areas or private homes has unorthodox ramifications on tackling food insecurity. At their core, all these solutions replace food banking with hyperlocal, hyper-convenient programs that disavow the industrial food banking framework that values volume over quality, bogus nutritional standards over an acceptance of what constitutes real food, temporary aid over long-term impact.
“Beggars can’t be choosers,” the saying goes, a crucial reminder that only pragmatism breeds productivity. It will always be a privilege to be picky about your diet. But this shouldn’t eliminate the element of choice altogether.
Those who do have the privilege of access to good nutrition must exercise it for those who don’t. At the very least, we can wake up from the chimera of food banking and feel no better about ourselves when we a see a poster ironically shaped like a nutrition label, proudly advertising the 500,000 people the Greater Boston Food Bank has “served” this year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
According to my friends, I’m a pussy. They’re not wrong. I use hypoallergenic laundry detergent, proudly call myself a hypochondriac, and most importantly, I am hyper cautious before approaching girls I’m interested in. And you know what? With the girls at least, I think I’m totally fine with that. How much better is it to be a pussy than to be rapey? Much better. That’s how much.
Now, in the previous paragraph, I constructed what might seem like a false binary—one that leaves all men in the position of either a “pussy” or “rapey.” But from what I’ve seen in my time here at Harvard—and really, from what I’ve seen in my time being a man in America—there isn’t actually much of an in between. In fact, for a straight guy, the seemingly magnetic pull towards either side of this spectrum is constant and strong. Bear with me…
Let’s start by defining some terms so you don’t read the rest of this piece thinking that by “pussy” I mean cat and by “rapey” I mean guilty of rape.
For the purposes of this column, I’m going to define these terms—which, for the record, I think are borderline abhorrent—as they’re defined by the people around me—the people who dictate the vernacular of college life and shape my idiolect. The people who call me a pussy. In their minds, a pussy is a term, rooted in misogyny, used to liken men who are afraid to take risks to a stereotypical woman. It refers to men who value certainty above risk-taking, who would rather not send the text than send it and have things be awkward.
By “rapey” I mean someone whose forward sexual advances make a woman feel uncomfortable or whose body language (read: decision to grind up on a girl from behind) is not only unwarranted, but remarkably presumptuous. In using the term “rapey” I am in no way mitigating the gravity of the crime of rape (although, clearly, the word “rapey” inherently creates a false equivalency). I’m just using the term as it is defined at college.
A college student who is called “rapey” is generally being accused of having what I call a Ben Roethlisberger mentality— the notion that nobody could possibly not want to have sex with an NFL quarterback. At Harvard, substitute NFL quarterback for egotistical National Science Champion, and sex for any kind of sexual advance, and you’ve got yourself a fairly solid definition of “rapey.”
I will admit that being a pussy is, in some ways, also a strategic choice, and sometimes, it gets the job done. Generally, when the strategy works, the timid, barely sensible signals I send out get interpreted correctly, or, as happens more often, girls subvert gender roles and make the first move (this is progress, Harvard!). But the truth is, more often than not, I miss chances or get “friendzoned” (a term I completely denounce), because either A) I never had a chance in the first place or B) I’m perfectly content being friends with girls and will not ever really push back on the role of the best friend.
Yes, this is partially a rationalization, and yes, much of the reason I don’t make more moves on girls in my day-to-day life undoubtedly stems from a fear of rejection. But that truly does not tell the whole story. Last week, my friend Riley laughed and said, “I always think Sammy’s wheeling, but he’s just making more and more friends.” He’s not entirely wrong. But what he didn’t fully encapsulate in his statement is that I don’t really see the distinction between those two things.
The way I want to “wheel”—the way I want to get with girls—is to be friends with them, to have long talks with them, to truly understand who they are as people. As much as I might wish that the label for my approach weren’t “pussy” (that word is just so uncomfortable, right?), I am not going to change the way I act towards women, except, you know, in trying to make sure fear doesn’t get in the way. After all, maybe it’s a need for connection, or maybe it’s just my lonely days in elementary school, but I really do like making friends, regardless of gender. I know, I’m a pussy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Friday, voting in the midterm elections for the Undergraduate Council closed with eight students newly elected. Ultimately, 17 candidates ran for the contested seats, but not until after the UC had extended deadlines for declarations when the original submission deadline passed with a total of only two students having declared their candidacies. The only competitive elections were in Adams, Lowell and Pforzheimer. Though the story of this most recent election may not be representative of the total level of student interest in the UC, it is an occasion to consider what the Council’s role is at Harvard, and what the implications are of choosing to remain uninvolved in their decisions.
The UC has the power and the resources to act as a real liaison between the student population and the administration, but as the midterm elections have helped to demonstrate, many on this campus do not take that responsibility very seriously. It would, however, be in our best interest to pay more attention to what our student government does.
In recent weeks, Undergraduate Council leaders have successfully implemented a new spring break meal plan, with the College promising to provide more options in March for students who remain on campus, detailed further initiatives for spreading the “HeForShe” movement at Harvard, and piloted condom dispensers in every freshman dorm. Yet most people wouldn’t consider the work of the UC as something that requires their own personal involvement, as the lack of candidates for Friday’s election helps to illuminate.
Like Sam Clark and Gus Mayopoulos famously successful joke campaign in 2013,  this year’s elections featured some of the same humor in an attempt to garner greater student interest. But the unserious nature of these campaigns may signify a larger problem with the student government’s relationship with its constituents. Even council members are not optimistic: In November, Cabot House representative Jacob R. Steinberg-Otter ’16 said, “We’re never [going to] see the day where the UC is a fully relevant body at Harvard.”
Moreover, on a day-to-day basis, the specific work of the UC is not well known to most on this campus. As UC representative Phebe Hong explained in a Crimson op-ed, “the main issue is that many students simply don’t know what the UC does . . . this past semester, the UC brought table numbers back to Annenberg, piloted a CharlieCard and took stances on Q Guide difficulty scores, unwarranted video-monitoring, and smaller section sizes.” In addition, the Council is responsible for allocating a budget of $450,000, a sum to which we all contribute in our term-bills and which matters because it supports the organizations and initiatives that make a real difference in the quality of our time here at Harvard.
In short, the UC deserves our attention. If we are to become active and involved citizens of the world upon our graduation, it should start while we are still students, with our more consistent participation and attention to the doings of the people we have elected to represent our wishes.

Four theatrical productions, visits to Harvard archives, and an array of literary texts comprise the curriculum for a History and Literature offering, taught by lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy ’93. The new course, “Staging the Civil War—From the Archive to the A.R.T.,” bridges disparate disciplines and methodologies, bringing a novel perspective to a 150-year-old war.
The class is offered in partnership with the American Repertory Theater, and hops from venue to venue—one week onstage with a visiting playwright, the next exploring the archives of the Schlesinger Library.
“If there is a play going on, that would be theater week; if there is an interesting archive going on, that would be an archive week,” said Cary A. Williams ’16, a student in the course. “Our syllabus is saturated with guest performances and guest lecturers, so it is a really unique opportunity to be able to connect with a lot of people from outside of Harvard.”
McCarthy designed the course to coincide with 150th anniversary of the end of the Civil War, capitalizing on the semester-long Harvard Civil War Project programming series.
“I want [students] to walk away with a deeper and richer understanding of the Civil War as more than just white boys on battlefields,” McCarthy said. “I want them to understand the Civil War was felt and understood and experienced and cried over, and that it was an emotional and sensory experience, that it is really the only time in the history of the United States where the nation was in peril in terms of whether or not it was going to endure.”
Accordingly, McCarthy’s students are encouraged to explore the Civil War from multiple disciplinary angles, drawing on methodologies from not only history and literature, but also political science and visual studies.
“We see this particular course as a wonderful example of bringing different players on campus together around a common theme,” said Diana Sorensen, dean of the Arts and Humanities Division.
Among the four plays the A.R.T. will stage is one of McCarthy’s own, an unfinished piece he hopes to workshop with the students. The play centers on four historical figures named Harriet in the Civil War era: Beecher Stowe, Wilson, Jacobs, and Tubman.
“This is an opportunity for me to say, ‘Look, I’m going to show you this work in progress. I want your feedback, your criticism, your close reading talent, your creativity,’” McCarthy said. “That feels very vulnerable in a way that I’ve never felt as a teacher, but it also feels thrilling and incredibly generative in terms of my own creative process.”
After receiving applications from around 40 students, McCarthy selected an enrollment of 22, which he jokingly called a “motley crew.” The students represent an array of concentrations, with “over half” in History and Literature, but others studying English, Comparative Religion, Government, and Philosophy, according to McCarthy.
“I hope that Harvard is moving more in the direction of courses that at least blur if not explode the kind of boundaries that we’re used to, academically, politically, morally, physically,” McCarthy said.

The Kennedy School of Government has raised $383 million as it works towards a capital campaign goal of $500 million, according to school spokesperson Doug Gavel.
The figure represents more than 75 percent of the school’s fundraising target, and comes less than a year after its public phase launch in May 2014. At the time of the launch, the school had already raised $336 million during the campaign’s quiet phase. By late last August, the school had raised $355 million.
The capital campaign will support a number of Kennedy School initiatives, most notably the campus remodeling and expansion effort that is slated to start after Commencement this spring. The construction will add 77,000 square feet of new building space and is focused in part on creating a more collaboration- and discussion-friendly academic environment.
Major public gifts thus far include a $3.5 million donation from hedge fund manager Louis M. Bacon last September and $11 million from Norwegian business magnate Christen Sveaas last October.
The Kennedy School’s goal is about eight percent of the University’s overall goal of $6.5 billion, twice the $250 million goal of the Graduate School of Education but only half of the Business School’s $1 billion target. The Business School passed a similar milestone in its fundraising in June 2014, having raised at least $721 million.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 20, 2015, at 3:21 a.m.
A year after their predecessors requested—and were not granted—$250,000 in funding, Undergraduate Council President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 and UC Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 on Thursday spent their first meeting with University President Drew G. Faust updating her on recent work including a smartphone calendar application.
Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal’s approach to their only meeting of the semester with Faust stands in stark contrast to last spring, when former UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 and former Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15 rallied outside Massachusetts Hall equipped with toilet paper in advance of their meeting. After running a social media campaign calling for an increase in student group funding, Mayopoulous and Goffard walked into Mass. Hall and asked Faust to increase their budget.
This year, Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal did not make any monetary demands.
The new UC leaders have said that, unlike their predecessors, they do not plan to pursue projects that involve heavy collaboration with administrators during their term, and instead hope to turn to more independent initiatives that they hope will be easier to deliver. Faust did not grant Mayopoulos and Goffard their demanded $250,000 last year.
Despite the lack of demands they brought to Faust, Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal said their meeting was generally met with success.
“It was fantastic. It was everything we expected,” Goyal said.
According to Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal, Faust agreed to attend an administrative forum held by the UC later this semester. UC leaders hope that Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and Dean of Faculty of the Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith will also attend. Undergraduates may approach the three administrators with general questions at that meeting, the UC leaders said. They have not yet set a date.
Also at the meeting, Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal updated Faust on the UC’s most recent initiatives: a proposed Harvard extension of a United Nations gender equity campaign, which is set to launch through the Institute of Politics later this spring, and Ventfull, a campus calendar smartphone application that the Council paid to bring to Harvard for the semester.
Faust indicated that she would attend the gender equity’s campaign launch “if her schedule allows,” Nasrollahzadeh said, and liked the calendar app. According to Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal, administrators are considering adding events from the President’s Office and Harvard Public Affairs and Communications to the app.
“She’s very appreciative of all of these initiatives that the UC is taking,” Goyal said. “She branded us as being very proactive this year, with concrete, tangible things that make a difference to the entire community.”
Nasrollahzadeh said she and Goyal also asked Faust about the possibility of the Smith Campus Center serving as a hub for cultural groups on campus. According to Nasrollahzadeh, Faust suggested that the Council work with Khurana on the proposal. The renovated campus center is scheduled to open in 2018.

Former New York City Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn joined members of undergraduate advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better in detailing goals to modify Harvard’s sexual harassment policies, improve transparency within those changes, and bolster training on the topic for students and administrators.
About fifty Harvard affiliates attended the Institute of Politics and Phillips Brooks House Association sponsored event Thursday evening, which marked the second in a series of discussions called “Let’s Talk Harvard.”
Quinn, who is a resident fellow at the IOP this semester, currently serves as a special adviser to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo focusing on campus sexual assault policies.
Quinn emphasized the importance of culling responses from victims of sexual violence in any instance in which schools modify their sexual harassment policy or procedures.
“If you don't have the survivor’s voice on the table, you’re not really doing the work, because the work is about helping victims become survivors and preventing further acts of violence,” she said.
Participants in the discussion frequently emphasized the role of institutional transparency in both demystifying sexual harassment procedures and revealing the tangible effects of policy modifications.
“There’s this saying which we’ve heard that sunlight is the best disinfectant, so transparency is incredibly important,” Quinn said.
Jessica R. Fournier ’17, an organizer for Our Harvard Can Do Better, criticized what she perceived to be a lack of transparency in the rollout of the University’s central sexual harassment policy and accompanying procedures. Under the new procedures in place in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, a central office leads investigations into cases of sexual harassment, while the College’s Administrative Board handles discipline.
“I think there really hasn't been much of a substantive effort on the part of the administration to actually engage with students,” Fournier said, referring specifically to the Ad Board’s disciplinary procedures.
Fournier and panelist Kathleen S. O'Beirne ’15, who is also an organizer for Our Harvard Can Do Better, reiterated the goal of increasing training for undergraduates on topics of sexual violence, suggesting that the College consider instituting a mandatory four-year program on the issue.
Panelists later responded to questions from audience members, some of whom raised concerns about potential difficulties that activists may face in recruiting additional support, particularly from those who did not attend the event.
“I would not underestimate the significance of having a large, well-informed, empowered choir. Sometimes we think preaching to the choir is useless. It’s not,” Quinn said.
The College is currently under federal investigation over its Title IX compliance following a complaint filed by at least one member of Our Harvard Can Do Better with the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights last spring.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Many department chairs in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences say that as the school reaches its largest size in history—with 730 faculty members as of October—they continue to face constraints on physical space, often forced to house their personnel in separate facilities across Harvard Square.
Occupying old buildings, adapted residential homes, and shared spaces, several departments in the social sciences and arts and humanities divisions must use every available inch of office space in order to accommodate instructors, classrooms, and events.
“I would say space is the single biggest issue in the Music department right now. We are completely maxed out,” said Music department chair Carol J. Oja, whose department’s single building sits behind the Science Center. “There are many, many space needs, approaching almost a crisis,” she added.
The Music department has sought to expand its physical space for around 15 years, according to Oja, who said that she and other department affiliates have written formal proposals lobbying for increased space.
Demands for space come while Harvard is in the midst of its largest-ever capital campaign, which seeks to raise $6.5 billion total for the University’s schools. FAS’s campaign plans to raise $2.5 billion of that total, including an initiative to raise $450 million for the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, which also faces space limitations with increasing numbers of personnel and contractors. That money—in part—will help fund the relocation of two-thirds of SEAS faculty to Allston slated for 2019.
While professors in the Arts and Humanities division are also eyeing Allston as a new venue for performance and rehearsal space, Oja said that the Music department would remain in Cambridge.
The East Asian Languages and Civilizations department, which is primarily housed at 2 Divinity Ave. along with Harvard’s Yenching Library, must disperse its staff, with around 40 administrators and language instructors holding their offices in a repurposed residential house on 5 Bryant St.
“We feel quite cramped, and it’s starting to affect our ability to do everything we would like to do,” said EALC interim department chair David L. Howell, adding that the building at 5 Bryant St. “was built as a house and was definitely not designed to accommodate that many people.”
“I have had multiple conversations over the years with the faculty who have proposed a new complex for East Asia Studies. My hope is that we are able to find a donor to support this effort," wrote FAS Dean Michael D. Smith in a statement.
Space constraints mean that the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures must separate its language instructors from department members.
“We have about 70 to 80 people coming to teach every term in the four [language] sections” of French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian, said RLL department chair Virginie Green. “We cannot give an office to all these people—they don’t expect that—but at least we should be able to give them a place for office hours or a place that they can put their materials when they go to class, and that’s difficult.”
Space constraints are nothing new to the Faculty, though, and not unique to Harvard, chairs said.
“It is always an issue at universities,” Sociology department chair Mary C. Brinton said. “It is not that it is an increasing concern, just an ongoing one.”
Housed in William James Hall, the Sociology department had “severe” space issues for the last few years, Brinton said, citing as causes its faculty’s return to its pre-recession size and many ladder faculty receiving tenure and thereby larger offices. Those issues were ameliorated when Sociology faculty and staff received space opened up by the summer 2014 move of the Anthropology department's social anthropology faculty to offices in the newly renovated Tozzer Library.
These kinds of expansions seem to be the only way to mitigate space constraints, chairs said, acknowledging the complexity of the University’s largely decentralized space planning process.
“I don’t have any clue about what’s the best thing to do in this situation with the number of different buildings and different administrative groups,” Greene said. “We just want to be less tight.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard China Project, a research program on China's environment and energy system based at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, plans to use grant money it received last week through the University’s inaugural Climate Change Solutions Fund to conduct research on the future of renewable energy sources in China.
Michael B. McElroy, a professor of Environmental Studies who chairs the project, founded it 20 years ago to “chart a low carbon energy future of China.”
Collaborating with researchers based in China, the project has produced a series of publications on issues related to China’s renewable energy sources, air pollution, and environmental policies.
According to McElroy, the project has ties with senior officials in the Chinese government. As such, its findings may produce concrete changes in China’s energy policies, he said.
“China consumes half of the world’s coal and is the world’s largest importer of oil, so it’s important to understand what’s happening there and what the implications are,” McElroy said.
Last November, U.S. President Barack Obama and China’s President Xi Jianping reached a landmark climate change agreement at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, in which China committed to stop its carbon emissions from growing by 2030.
“But getting there is not easy and requires complicated research. The work we do here is a significant contribution to that goal,” McElroy said.
The project includes members who are highly knowledgeable about China’s environmental reality. Xi Lu, a research associate at the Harvard China Project who holds degrees from both Harvard and Tsinghua University, is researching the potential for wind energy in China.
"China's GDP is growing very fast, which means the energy demand is also growing very fast. This gives it an opportunity to invest in renewables," Lu said.
The grant from University President Drew G. Faust’s fund will help the interdisciplinary program grow its ties with other departments and institutions, McElroy said.
“[The grant] will help cement the relationships that exist between what we do at SEAS with colleagues at [the Department of] Economics,...the School of Public Health, and the Kennedy School, and [with] partners in China, notably Tsinghua University in Beijing,” McElroy said.
The Harvard China Project is also funded by the U.S. government, private foundations, and the China Three Gorges Corporation.
Created last April, Faust’s Climate Change Solutions Fund supports research initiatives intended to tackle climate change and accelerate the transition from carbon-based to renewable energy sources. Six other projects were also awarded grants.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard affiliates are planning a weeklong sit-in protest around Massachusetts Hall this April to demand that the Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—divest Harvard’s endowment from fossil fuels.
In an open letter posted online early Friday morning, more than two dozen alumni called for fellow University graduates to gather in Harvard Yard for the protest that organizers are calling “Harvard Heat Week.” The event website, created by the activist group Divest Harvard, calls for 50 to 100 people to participate in each day of the sit-in, which is scheduled to begin on April 13 and culminate with a “major event” on April 18.
Just last week, more than 30 students from Divest Harvard occupied Mass. Hall, some for 24 hours, calling on University President Drew G. Faust to divest. Harvard’s endowment is valued at $35.9 billion.
In April, activists plan to engage in “highly civil civil disobedience,” both locally through the sit-in demonstration around Mass. Hall and remotely through social media, phone, and email, according to the open letter. Its signatories include filmmaker Darren S. Aronofsky ’91, Nobel Peace Prize winner Eric S. Chivian ‘64, Pulitzer Prize winner Susan C. Faludi ’81, actress Natalie Portman ’03, activist-author Cornel R. West ’74, and former Colorado Senator Timothy E. Wirth ’61.
Despite emphasizing the plan to protest “peacefully and politely but firmly,” the letter hinted at the potential for police intervention. “If anyone is to be led away by the University Police, surely it’s easier for those of us with stable and secure lives than for students at the start of their careers,” the alumni signatories wrote.
According to the “Heat Week” website, all protesters must attend a non-violence training and an action briefing before participating in the sit-in.
The alumni will work alongside Divest Harvard, which has been advocating divestment on campus for more than two years, to implement the week of programming. Chloe S. Maxmin ’15, Divest Harvard student outreach coordinator and co-founder, said  she expects more than 100 alumni to participate.
“Since we’ve begun to escalate and get more serious with the action, we’ve been planning this coalition week with alumni,” Maxmin said. “It was a mutual effort to push it forward, but we’re very grateful that alumni are coming to support students on campus.”
Faust, despite the urgings of student activists, has maintained that Harvard will not divest from fossil fuels. She has argued that Harvard can contribute to environmental sustainability and reduce fossil fuel dependence through research and teaching. Last week, her Climate Change Solutions Fund awarded $800,000 in grants to Harvard affiliates for projects focusing on climate change.
Divest Harvard, meanwhile, has continued to push for their cause. The group announced plans to launch a fossil fuel-free fund, which seeks alumni donations as an alternative to the University’s endowment, earlier this month.
The open letter’s full list of signatories includes Craig S. Altemose, filmmaker Darren S. Aronofsky ’91, Charles “Al” Boright ’68, Rev. Margaret M. Bullitt-Jonas, Nobel Peace Prize winner Eric S. Chivian ’64, Pulitzer Prize winner Susan C. Faludi ’81, H. Jack Geiger, Todd A. Gitlin ’63, Neva R. Goodwin ’66, Rev. Dr. Ray A. Hammond ‘71, Jon T. Isham ‘82, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. ’76, Maya Lin, Bevis Longstreth, Robert K. Massie, Edwin S. Matthews ’56, Timothy P. McCarthy ’93, Bill E. McKibben ’82, Ricken S. Patel, actress Natalie Portman ’03, former member of the Harvard Board of Overseers Gay W. Seidman ’78, Rev. Fred E. Small, Rev. Dan Smith, Rev. Betsy J. Sowers, Rev. Burns Stanfield, Wen Stephenson ’90, Rhea S. Suh ’98,  Rev. Elizabeth A.  Walker, Cornel R. West ’74, Rev. Dr. Gloria White-Hammond, Kelsey D. Wirth ’92, and former Colorado Sen. Timothy E. Wirth ’61.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tyler Moy is on the move.
The sophomore forward has been up and down the Harvard men’s ice hockey team’s lineup this year. He began the season as the team’s third-line center before moving up to the first line to skate in between juniors Jimmy Vesey and Kyle Criscuolo.
Meanwhile, he climbed into the ECAC Hockey’s elite. After a 10-point rookie campaign, the San Diego native has already doubled that total this year to sit tied for 14th on the conference leaderboard.
Now, with the full return of classmate forwards Alex Kerfoot, Sean Malone, and Luke Esposito from injury last week, Moy expects to wing Malone and Esposito on the second line when Harvard (13-8-3, 9-6-3 ECAC) travels to New York’s North Country to face No. 20/- St. Lawrence (16-11-3, 12-5-1) and Clarkson (11-15-4, 8-8-2) this weekend.
So far, Moy has taken all of the changes in stride. His new line scored twice in Harvard’s 4-1 win over Colgate last Friday, and he reunited with Vesey to put a third past the Raiders with one-tenth of a second left in the middle frame.
“You kind of have to just take it as it comes and have a good attitude about it and give the coach a good reason to play you,” Moy said Tuesday. “I just want to contribute to the team as a whole, wherever that may be.”
With two weekends left in the ECAC regular season, Moy is not the only Crimson player making adjustments. The ebb and flow of the team’s injury issues have forced Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 to reshuffle combinations nearly across the board.
But on a deeper level, Harvard is trying to recapture its buzz from earlier in the season. A seven-game winning streak rocketed the Crimson to No. 3 in the national polls, but a sub-par start to 2015 has placed the squad on the bubble for making the national tournament.
The losses exposed mistakes with which the Crimson got away earlier in the year. Since January, Moy says, the team has taken a step back and looked inward. On the ice, Donato and associate head coach Paul Pearl have re-emphasized fundamentals. Off the ice, the team has consulted a sports psychologist and has talked about “playing with pride.”
“When you’re challenged with losing and struggles like that, you kind of have to remember what your identity is as a team,” Moy said. “That’s something that we’ve talked about within the past weeks—about who we are as a team and what we want to be.”
With a conference postseason bye and NCAA Tournament bid on the line, this weekend will be a challenging test for a Harvard team that is just starting to get its confidence back.
The Crimson will start work on Friday at St. Lawrence, the only team to chase junior goaltender Steve Michalek out of the net this season. The Saints, which enter this weekend four points ahead of the Crimson for second place in the ECAC, scored three first-period goals on Jan. 17 before Donato pulled Michalek in a 5-1 loss at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center. Michalek is more than ready to put the experience behind him.
“They came out of the gate hard, and I didn’t have it that night,” Michalek said Wednesday. “I didn’t play the way I wanted to play, but that’s in the past. For a goalie especially, it doesn’t matter who you play. You just stop whatever shots you get.”
He will be playing across from Kyle Hayton, who stopped 46 pucks that night to bolster his claim as the conference’s unquestioned rookie of the year. Under the freshman’s stewardship, the Saints won seven straight games over January and February before losing, 2-1, at conference-leading No. 11/10 Quinnipiac last weekend.
Michalek and Moy have fonder memories of their last time out against the Golden Knights, who are three points behind the Crimson in the conference standings. On the strength of an offensive outburst from its top line, Harvard beat Clarkson, 6-3, the night before Hayton’s heroics.
Moy remembers something different about his team that night.
“I think we played with a confidence [against Clarkson],” Moy said. “I think when our team is doing best, we kind of have a swagger about ourselves, and I think that’s the way we need to keep going from this point on.”
With injured players and returners, Harvard will finish the regular season looking like a different team than the one that started it. The next nine days will determine whether that difference is a positive one.
"I think we got a little bit of momentum this past weekend,” Michalek said. “We got back on the same page and got back to how we want to play. We’re just trying to build on that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Everyone in the gym could see it coming.
As Columbia senior Jeff Coby’s three rattled through the net—completing the Lions’ comeback from a 17-point halftime deficit—junior co-captain Siyani Chambers began motioning for the inbound. Harvard coach Tommy Amaker lets his players play through these situations, trying to catch the defense before it’s set; his floor general was ready to go.
Chambers brought the ball up, scarcely looking at trailing senior wing Wesley Saunders. By the time he started his drive, Saunders was still ambling up the right side—sliding into position for the dribble handoff play Harvard ran in similar situations against UMass and Brown.
Columbia point guard Maodo Lo picked Chambers up, shading over to make the left-handed Cham   bers finish with his right. Then came the hesitation dribble, a quick bit of separation and the flick. The ball splashed through the net for the ensuing game winner, and Crimson fans heaved a sigh of relief.
As the Ivy League race barrels to a head, Chambers remains the most intriguing part of the whole puzzle. He is not the league’s best player—heck, his coach readily gives the “team’s best player” title to backcourt mate Saunders. Assessing his play—and value to the team—is complicated.
After Amaker stressed before the season his goal for Chambers to improve his decision-making and shot selection, the junior’s shooting marks are down across the board for a second-straight year. His turnover ratio is nearly 21 percent, and he has a rock-bottom 42.5 percent effective field goal percentage.
But what he can give you is harder to measure. Since arriving on campus, he’s been the team’s primary ball handler and an on-court presence; elected a captain after his sophomore year, Amaker noted Wednesday that the team’s youngest rotation player has become its vocal leader. On a team struggling for offense, Chambers sprints on every rebound—creating as many “secondary break” opportunities as possible, looking for easy points on every drive.
His defense has improved drastically since his freshman year, with his defensive rating dropping nearly 10 points. By any measure, he’s the team’s best clutch player. Chambers has shot eight-of-13 in the final two minutes of single-possession games in his career, leaving a litany of opponents empty-handed.
Freshman year it was BU, driving right and creating space for a step-back jumper as time expired. Sophomore year was Cincinnati, when Chambers nailed a crucial jumper late to clinch the victory. In December, he nailed a three at the end of regulation to send his team into overtime against Vermont.
After the Vermont jumper, Chambers turned to his bench. The most effusive Crimson player was stoic, staring down his teammates with unbridled satisfaction and a touch of smugness. The point guard carries himself with the cocksureness of someone who’s won everywhere he’s gone.
It’s not misplaced.
The junior is a staggering 54-20 in his career at Harvard. He made his high school varsity team in eighth grade, teaming up with Royce White as a freshman to take home his first state title. When White left, little changed—Chambers made it a trifecta of state championships. His senior year, he averaged 30 points a game in single-handedly willing his team to third place.
His freshman year, he led all Division I freshmen with 5.7 assists a game—taking on a leadership position as, in the wake of the withdrawal of two of its best players, the team coalesced around him. Shooting 42 percent from three, he and Saunders were the league’s best backcourt. Then-senior Christian Webster ’13 noted, “Laurent [Rivard ’14] and I are the captains, but he’s the leader.”
In many ways, this Crimson team has deeper shades of 2012 than 2013. Harvard hasn’t blown out opponents as it did last year, giving away double-digit leads in half of its league games. Chambers noted Wednesday with more than a hint of disgust that the team has struggled to finish games.
As the team kicks off its stretch run this weekend—Saturday starts a stretch of four straight games against the rest of the league’s top five—no player will be more important to its success. And when it comes time to finish, the ball will be in his hands.
On to the games:
CORNELL AT YALE:
Stop the presses; Yale solved pot brownies.
No, seriously. The study’s lead author compared the desire of baked college students to eat inhuman amounts of Doritos to hitting the accelerator in your car instead of the brake. In this realm of ill-advised analogies, drunken public urination seems quite similar to giving your Valentine a turnip instead of a cupcake.
Pick: Yale
PRINCETON AT DARTMOUTH:
The league’s sneakiest rivalry rears its head again this weekend. The Big Green crushed the Tigers by 31 in football this year, following its 28-24 victory on the season’s final week last year that denied Princeton an outright title. On the football field, the teams play for arguably the coolest trophy in sports, the Sawhorse Dollar, and the overall series is tied 43-43-4.
The basketball hasn’t been droll—Dartmouth took out Princeton in Hanover last year and came five points from the feat in Jadwin the year before. Yet the two teams are looking at a long struggle to re-join the league’s upper echelon; on Friday, a (sawhorse) dollar might buy a ticket.
Pick: Princeton
COLUMBIA AT BROWN:
Dear reader, you know by now this column demands its writer scour the depths of Ivy League journalism, finding the bastions of irresponsibility and comedy that lie there. To quote a former teaching fellow of mine, it demands “fighting the balrogs so you don’t have to.”
It is with this proposition I present to you the Brown Daily Herald’s Drunk/Sober/High series. Exactly what it sounds like, the most recent review of Fifty Shades of Grey—for the uneducated, the book-turned-film is Twilight fan fiction with teenage Miley Cyrus try-hard erotic overtones—shows how low alcohol can take you.
The nadir? “Gmail is a highly underrated method of sexting.”
Oh Howard, I do worry about this generation.
Pick: Columbia
PENN AT HARVARD:
For the year, the Quakers are being outscored by 0.22 points per possession—the same margin as last year’s 1-13 Cornell team. Maybe that’s why Penn senior forward Greg Louis admitted this week in The Daily Pennsylvanian that he’d been asked by a group of eight-year-old girls how his team still tries with no hope of a league title.
I’m not sure what Louis told the precocious Girl Scouts, but I’d bet he didn’t mention the team has lost three of five by 25 points or more. Or that the losing got so bad a DP writer spent his Valentine’s Day tweeting moribund facts about the team’s historical pitifulness.
With Harvard having beaten Penn three straight times—and posting a plus-75 margin of victory in the process—a morose soliloquy from dear Steven Saturday almost seems inevitable.
Pick: Harvard
COLUMBIA AT YALE:
Much like last year, a Harvard-Yale showdown for all the marbles in the penultimate game of the year appears inevitable. Each team plays four of its last six at home, with no trips to Jadwin left on the schedule. In both cases, the Lions may have the best chance of the remaining teams at playing the spoiler.
Not only does Columbia play a high-variance strategy, but they have arguably the league’s third-best player in Maodo Lo. Before Chambers sent him sprawling on his game-winner Friday, Lo used a devastating crossover to put Crimson defender after Crimson defender on the floor. He was in total control—demonstrating proficiency at the rim, in the midrange, and beyond the arc. He had six threes in a narrow loss to Yale at Levien three weeks ago, and the team needs the same here to throw the race upside down.
Pick: Yale
CORNELL AT BROWN:
Both teams split a pair of contests last weekend, losing to one of the league’s upper echelon squads and crushing a bottom feeder the next night. Given that only the Gentleman’s C’s post a pair of consecutive challenging games, such a pattern isn’t unusual this year. In fact, teams handling the Harvard-Dartmouth, Brown-Yale, and Penn-Princeton duos have managed a split 61-percent of the time, with only three sweeps all year.
Pick: Cornell
PENN AT DARTMOUTH:
In what amounts to a suckerpunch to the hosts, Penn will play the game under the specter of potential legislation that could change campus forever. Yes, I am referring to the proposed Pennsylvania bill that could lower hard liquor prices across the state. In a wholly predictable series of events, a thirsty Dartmouth athletic department (25-25-1 since the announcement of the hard liquor ban) will welcome its hosts with commensurate jealousy and anger.
Pick: Dartmouth
PRINCETON AT HARVARD:
Two-and-a-half games out with five more to play, barring a road sweep of Yale and Harvard, the Tigers look to be fighting for a CIT bid. That’s not to say the Crimson will underestimate Mitch Henderson’s squad. Amaker admitted Wednesday the team adjusts more for Princeton’s offense than any other in the league, showcasing the on-ball pressure needed to deny Princeton’s quirky offense of backdoor cuts and three-point barrages.
Harvard begins a tough four-game stretch here against the rest of the league’s top five—anything less than 3-1, and it will be watching at home come NCAA Tournament time. If last weekend showed anything, however, it’s that this team embraces such moments.
Pick: Harvard

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In what might be most accurately described as a methodical blowout, the Harvard men’s basketball team effectively silenced Penn for a nine-minute span in the second half of Friday night’s contest, enabling the Crimson to cruise to its seventh consecutive conference victory.
While Harvard never trailed after the 17:52 mark of the first period, the Quakers managed to stay in the contest for much of the game, with a Darnell Foreman three-pointer bringing the visiting team within six with 14 minutes to go.
But five minutes of scoreless play from Penn gave the Crimson all the time it needed to create some breathing room—and it took advantage, going on a 12-0 run and digging a hole that Penn could not climb its way out of. When the final buzzer sounded, Harvard (18-5, 8-1 Ivy) had earned its fourth-straight 20-plus-point victory over the Quakers (7-15, 2-6), winning, 69-46, Friday evening at Lavietes Pavilion.
“I think we just came out with more intensity in the second half,” senior wing Wesley Saunders said. “We gave up some easy points in the first half, so we wanted to lock down defensively and just put our mark on the game.”
After the Foreman triple from the left corner cut Penn’s deficit to 37-31, Harvard turned to senior forward Jonah Travis—the big man whom coach Tommy Amaker has deemed the squad’s “sparkplug”—to get things going. Travis hit two free throws and converted an up-and-under layup on consecutive possessions, extending the Crimson’s advantage to double digits once more.
A subsequent steal and coast-to-coast lay-in from junior co-captain Siyani Chambers followed by two free-throws from fellow co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi tied Harvard’s biggest lead of the night at 14, setting the stage for freshman Andre Chatfield to bring the Crimson bench to its feet 20 seconds later. After another Harvard steal, Chambers sent a bullet pass to the rookie, who was waiting in the left short corner—Chatfield took just one dribble to get to the paint before flipping up and in a baby jumper.
One more field goal—this time a right-wing jump shot from Moundou-Missi—capped off Harvard’s 12-0 run. The Quakers’ three-pointer on their next possession ended their 5:17 span without a field goal, but it was too little, too late for Penn, which committed more turnovers (five) in that stretch of time than the Crimson did in the entire second period (four).
For Amaker, it was an uptick in Harvard’s aggression on the defensive end that enabled the team to run away with the game after intermission.
“I thought our defense again was our calling card and was the difference for us,” Amaker said. “When we were able to get our defense set and lock in [early in the second half], I thought we were pretty solid.”
While the run may have begun on the defensive end, Friday night marked the best shooting performance the Crimson has put up since its season opener on Nov. 14, knocking down shots at a 53.2 percent clip.
Led by Saunders, who connected on seven of his nine field goal attempts en route to a game-high 15 points, Harvard did the majority of its damage off of turnovers and on second-chance opportunities, outscoring Penn by a combined 32 points in the two categories.
Saunders was aided by his co-captains, Chambers and Moundou-Missi, who totaled 24 points on an efficient 8-of-13 shooting performance from the floor.
While the Crimson relied on several familiar faces, the Quakers were forced to turn to some fresh bodies to shoulder the burden on the offensive end. Just hours before tipoff, Penn announced the two-game suspension of leading scorer Tony Hicks, paving the way for freshman guard Antonio Woods to pace his squad on the evening. The rookie tallied team-highs in points (12), assists (four), and minutes (33), often being face-guarded by Harvard’s best defender in Saunders.
For Amaker, the Crimson’s play on Friday night was indicative of a team hitting its stride at the right moment in the year. With his program winning consecutive games by a double-digit margin for the first time since the beginning of January, Amaker believes that the mindset the Crimson has at this point in conference play bodes well for the team as it prepares for the season’s final stretch.
“We’ve been really focused on continuing to get better,” Amaker explained. “I think we’re showing signs of improvement.… I like that about our ball club, that we’re still working to improve. If teams can adopt that mentality and that attitude, I like to think there really are good things in store.”

Happy Friday! It’s the weekend...again! Wasn’t it just the weekend like, a couple days ago? Amazing how quickly time is flying by, but no one's complaining that it's Friday.
IN THE ATMOSPHEREGet ready for sun! Put on some sunglasses and slather on sunscreen to get ready for the day.
