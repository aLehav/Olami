After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At Dartmouth, the giving rate for the senior-class gift this year was a staggering 99.9 percent, with only one student refusing to donate. Toward the end of the campaign when it became clear that the participation rate was not going to be 100 percent, peer pressure ensued, with Dartmouth’s student blog publicly criticizing the lone student. Yet the student continued to defend her decision, noting that her “negative experiences of Dartmouth outweighed the positive—that is all.” Such severe criticism by the student body was unwarranted. As senior classes everywhere try to raise money in creative and fruitful manners, they would do well to allow seniors to have their own opinions and make decisions that align with their personal values in terms of either donating or choosing not to do so.
Senior-gift programs in which soon-to-be alumni are encouraged to give back to their school are quite common. Often, however, these programs rely on peer-pressure tactics and stigmas to solicit further donations from students who have not yet donated—in addition to Dartmouth, Cornell earned well-deserved criticism for the extreme pressure placed on students to give a gift. Indeed, a forced gift at the end of one’s college career is not a constructive way to generate philanthropic trends in alumni. Students should give to their universities because they believe in supporting the causes their money will help, not because their names will otherwise be published on a blog and they will be harassed by their peers.
Accordingly, any outreach done by senior-gift programs should be for awareness purposes only, not coercion. Gifts allow colleges to create more scholarship programs and provide extra resources for students. Ideally, students will be inspired to give when they think of what their gift will provide incoming classes, rather than the pressure received by the outgoing senior class.
At Harvard, all seniors are asked to give $10 to senior gift. Additionally, there is a tiered program by which students who give $250 or more become part of Harvard College Fund Associates Program. The Associates Program provides a structure and incentives that encourage alumni to contribute to the College—a worthy way of securing the College some of the funds it needs to foster its cutting-edge learning and research environment while affording opportunities to students from different socioeconomic backgrounds.
Yet making the distinction between being a regular donor to senior gift and being part of the Associates Program senior year, pre-graduation, is too early. Senior gift contributions are largely based on a student’s circumstances—accordingly, making distinctions due to students’ wealth while they are in college is detrimental to the egalitarian community the College tries so hard to protect. Such stratification is far less scarring after college.
Universities have a pressing need for contributions. As they create programs and provide incentives for students to give through senior gifts, however, they must be mindful of the different circumstances and opinions of the seniors they ask—and they must respect their decisions. The goal of a senior gift, after all, is to establish the habit of giving after graduation, not to secure a one-time, superficial $10.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Throngs of college students joined the masses heading to Washington, D.C. in planes, trains, and Zipcars for Jon Stewart’s “Rally to Restore Sanity” two Saturdays ago. The rally’s concept was to provide a breath of fresh air amid a political discourse that is increasingly combative and vitriolic, something that was especially true in the run-up to the midterm elections. Send me your mellow, your hipsters, your huddled masses yearning to speak calmly, Stewart seemed to be asking. There were to be no Hitler comparisons, no cataclysmic rhetoric at this rally, merely a resolute call for the return of reason. It is a message that all of America needs to hear. Some friends and I were planning to make the trek down to DC, but we couldn’t quite summon the energy to break away from our lives here for two days. I find my own complacency here pathetic; however, I am certainly not alone in my inertia on this campus.  Even though much of the rest of the country could benefit from turning down the rhetorical intensity about political issues, Harvard students should heed just the opposite call.
Political apathy runs amok in Harvard Yard. Surely most students, if pressed, are informed and have opinions on current events and issues. Gone, however, are the days of the protests, the sit-ins, and the political activism that are so associated with idealistic college students. Where’s the passion? Where’s the I’m-mad-as-hell-and-I’m-not-going-to-take-it-anymore attitude of the 1960s that challenged the status quo and put pressure on our leaders? When I was visiting Harvard as a high school senior last year, I sat in on the final lecture of Louis Menand’s “Art and Thought in the Cold War.” In it, he screened footage of a protest in Harvard Yard that he himself had recorded as an adolescent during the 60s. Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates surely must be relieved that he has not drawn the same collegiate ire as his predecessor, Robert McNamara, the architect of the Vietnam War who incited several on-campus demonstrations. Except to turn in study cards, when’s the last time since that era that students have occupied University Hall?
That’s not to say that there is a total vacuum of political activism on campus. Students came out in full force to condemn the Social Studies department’s honoring of the serially politically incorrect Marty Peretz.  There are myriad political groups and publications, ranging from the nonpartisan to the hyper-ideological. A few of my fellow Thayerites even organized a “Protest Against Protests” in front of the Science Center a month ago, sort of a prelude to Saturday’s rally on the National Mall. The Institute of Politics organizes voter registration drives and public discussions among other things, but all of it just seems so—civil.
Call me old-fashioned, but I think some zealotry and fervor does a political system good. Too much tranquility in our political discourse, and we might just doze off during a governmental travesty. While the Tea Party’s irrational and frenzied manner provides no benefit to the public debate, nor does artificial and monetized cable news punditry, they are taking full advantage of their First Amendment rights. As college students, we can do the same thing, though perhaps with a little more rationality in our passion.
Consider all the issues that are relevant to college students today. Major legislation was recently passed fully reforming the way student loans are handled. The economy is still languishing, jobs are as scarce as ever, and graduation draws nearer, daily, for all of us. Since we have access to University Health Services, health care reform is not as personally relevant: But, how will Wall Street reform affect the big chunk of each graduating class that trades in their Harvard backpacks for Goldman Sachs briefcases? We’re still at war, and even though we aren’t in immediate danger of being drafted, that should still mean something.
Stewart and his supporters call for an end to the name-calling and overreactions that dominate the popular political narrative, and should be commended. But this can be a turning point in the political conversation, and we students should see it as a call to rise up and take back our places as demonstrators-in-chief.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Final club traditions have been anything but static. Members have, in one way or another, changed the practices of their clubs to better reflect the evolving values of the Harvard community. In fact, in 1918, no Jewish students were admitted to several final clubs, but by 1986, one-third of final club presidents were Jewish. Despite these changes, sexist, racist, heterosexist, and economically discriminatory practices are still a reality at Harvard’s final clubs.
Looking at the history of change so far, we believe that these practices should no longer be accepted as intrinsic parts of Harvard’s social scene. The Radcliffe Union of Students has historically been at the forefront of social space reform activism at Harvard, and today, we are proud to continue that tradition by lending our wholehearted support to the efforts of the final club campaign in reopening and maintaining this dialogue about final clubs and social space.
We are concerned with the way final club practices contribute to the formation of a gendered power imbalance that negatively affects Harvard undergraduates and is especially harmful to women, students of color, LGBTQ students, and low-income students. This imbalance can manifest itself in a number of ways, from sexist party themes to creating environments in which women feel uncomfortable asserting themselves, or from the striking gender imbalance of the UC and last year's class marshals to casually sexist language in everyday interactions with fellow students.
However, our support for the campaign is not simply a critique of the gender-segregated nature of final clubs, and we respect that our roommates, blockmates, linkmates, and friends who are members of single-sex social organizations find value in their groups. Nor is our support a reactive response to the recent actions of Sigma Chi or Yale’s Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. Instead, our focus is on realizing the potential social space at Harvard has to better represent our community’s contemporary values.
We are particularly concerned about ensuring the safety and well-being of women who choose to attend off-campus social events such as those hosted by final clubs. We acknowledge the efforts made by some final clubs to make their spaces safer and more inclusive, but these efforts vary widely from club to club. As an example, current final club participation with Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response sexual assault prevention trainings is optional and has been inconsistent.
It has been difficult to engage in even informal dialogue about social space with final club representatives. Recent attempts include a discussion in April 2009 and a series of Crimson articles about sexual assault on campus, one of which featured final clubs. However, only two final club members chose to participate in the discussion, and the article on sexual assault was attacked in the comments—defensive final club members derailed the conversation with “apologies” for partying. Again, our critique of final club culture is not, and has never been, about criticizing students who choose to host or attend large parties, but rather is about questioning the effects these organizations’ practices have on the Harvard community.
Because of this non-cooperative environment, it is imperative that Harvard students demand formal dialogue between final club leaders, university administrators, and members of the general Harvard community. Current administrative involvement with final clubs is almost non-existent, and as such, final club leadership is left almost entirely to the clubs themselves and their governing boards. In the absence of any official stance or statement from Harvard, final clubs are allowed to operate without any outside pressure, accountability, or consequence. As a result, legitimate issues of exclusivity, gendered power imbalance, hazing, and sexual assault remain unaddressed.
As feminists, we are committed to questioning and challenging privilege in all its forms, but this commitment would not be complete without also explicitly working towards a vision in which power is equally distributed amongst men and women. As such, we appreciate the final club campaign’s efforts to reinstate the party fund and to open up more gender-neutral spaces for student parties. Additionally, the final club campaign has already hosted two informal discussions—RUS co-sponsored the second—and is currently collecting narratives on final club experiences and beginning a publicity campaign. However, all of these actions are in vain unless we, as a community, support them.
Working toward actual reform requires individual involvement alongside community efforts. As individuals, we can choose whether to participate in final club culture. As a community, we can choose whether to support the final club campaign’s push for open social spaces and accountability within final clubs. However, now is the time for the Harvard community to move forward toward a vision in which all students, regardless of gender, can be fully empowered actors in the Harvard community.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After putting it off for over a month, during which I wondered how a 111-minute film could possibly claim to deconstruct America’s complex education crisis, I finally succumbed to the rave reviews and ventured out to see “Waiting for ‘Superman.’”  Ultimately, while I found the film’s portrayal of teachers’ unions to be insightful, director P. Davis Guggenheim falls short in identifying the best solutions to combating these unions. Specifically, the film relies on an outdated conception of “merit pay” and fails to recognize the most important factor preventing America’s brightest graduates from becoming teachers: the profession’s declining prestige.
The greatest strength of Guggenheim’s film is its diagnosis of the problem with America’s public schools: a breakdown in the teacher-student relationship. As research indicates, except for socioeconomic factors beyond schools’ control, teacher quality provides the single best indicator of student success. The Los Angeles Times recently reported that students whose teachers were rated in the top ten percent for effectiveness scored up to “17 percentile points higher in English and 25 points higher in math” than students whose teachers were in the bottom ten percent. Monitoring teacher quality is the most effective way for schools to improve student performance—all that remains is for them to start doing it.
One of the reasons they don’t, however, is the strength of teachers’ unions. Dr. Howard Fuller, former superintendent of the Milwaukee school district, claims that he couldn’t fire teachers who had been caught on camera reading newspapers instead of teaching their classes; when he did eventually fire the teachers, he had to hire them back a year later (with back pay) because of union-backed tenure statutes. When New Jersey Governor Christopher J. “Chris” Christie, in an attempt to prevent layoffs, asked teachers to take a pay freeze for one year and contribute 1.5 percent of their salaries to health benefits, the union refused his offer. Ultimately, while one in 57 doctors and one in 97 lawyers lose their licenses every year, the comparable statistic for public-school teachers is one in 2,500.
These aren’t examples of unions protecting hardworking employees victimized by unfair management; these are unions abusing their power to protect underperforming teachers and ensure excessive benefits that no other employees in either the public or private sector enjoy. They illustrate the reasons why tenure, a vestige of the system of college professorships, should never have been extended to protect grade-school teachers. In no other profession are workers systematically shielded from assaults on poor performers, and teaching—that most important of professions—shouldn’t be exempt from the standards of accountability that govern a responsible workforce.
For Guggenheim, making teacher pay contingent on performance represents the corrective to uncompromising unions, but his film overlooks the difficulty of effectively measuring teacher performance. The fallback system of evaluating educators based on standardized test scores, which the film seems to advocate, is arbitrary and incomplete. Students who have benefitted from the teacher’s class may underperform due to nerves or poor test-taking skills. Other factors like parental involvement may contribute to a student’s improvement, just as much as teacher competence and socioeconomic or personal circumstances can negate the progress made by an effective educator. Essentially, test scores can be influenced by too many factors besides good teachers to make them a reliable standard of teacher performance.
Nonetheless, they may constitute one factor within a more holistic approach, as former Chancellor of the Washington, D.C., schools Michelle A. Rhee has proposed. Under Rhee’s system, test scores would be combined with detailed classroom observations and broader measures of student improvement. This holistic approach provides a more accurate means of determining teacher effectiveness, and providing higher-performing teachers with higher salaries makes sense both to reward the strongest educators and incentivize improvement among their lower-performing peers.
Nonetheless, short-term solutions to the problems posed by teachers’ unions cannot compensate for the fact that America’s brightest college graduates aren’t seeking out teaching as a desirable profession. In nations such as Finland, where teachers are universally unionized and students consistently outperform American children, unionization poses less of a problem because teaching is regarded as a prestigious profession that attracts the best and the brightest. Protecting incompetent teachers isn’t as much of a concern because competent teachers self-select into the system.
In the United States, programs like Teach for America, which has attracted thousands of qualified applicants, and the Boston Teacher Residency, which provides aspiring teachers with a four-year training program similar to a doctor’s residency, are helping to raise the profession’s prestige in the eyes of college graduates. Expansion of these and similar programs can affect the kind of cultural change necessary to alter the way Americans view teaching as a career. It is this broader approach to education—an approach that acknowledges the importance of measuring teacher performance and encouraging America’s best students to become teachers—that “Waiting for ‘Superman’” misses. Until a documentary that presents this kind of approach comes along, I’m not waiting for Superman—just a better movie.

The fourth annual Harvard Graduate Conference in Political Theory convened students from across the world last weekend to discuss various academic papers about political theory.
Organized by graduate students from the government department at Harvard, the conference featured 10 papers by graduate students from other schools such as Brown, Duke, Oxford, and Cambridge. Harvard graduate student “discussants” provided critical responses to the pieces presented by the authors.
William Selinger, a third-year Harvard graduate student in attendance, said the conference sought to encourage discussion among graduate students across different universities—a particularly important task given that the field of political theory often lacks forums for discussion and critical support, as the conference’s website states.
“The way political theory works is by conversation and collegial critique,” said Jonathan R. Bruno, an organizer of the event. “For most of us, it’s essential to discuss work in progress with our colleagues across the discipline.”
Yale Professor of Political Science Bryan D. Garsten ’96, who also graduated from GSAS, gave a keynote address in which he presented his paper “Being Represented.” He discussed the idea of “being represented,” a political state of being conceived by French and American post-revolutionary liberals as a true alternative to the classical categories of ‘ruling’ and ‘being ruled.”
“I thought that it [the keynote] was historically very rich and also a very interesting and provocative way of thinking about the claims, problems and experience of political democracy,” said GSAS student Joshua L. Cherniss.
Jonathan R. Bruno, one of the conference’s organizers, estimated about 40 or more people were in attendance on Friday.
Rita Koganzon, another conference organizer, said she thought the strong attendance boded well for future years.
The first Harvard Graduate Conference in Political Theory was held in 2007. The original idea for the event came from Professor of Government Michael E. Rosen, who knew of a graduate philosophical conference at Oxford, according to Cherniss.
The conference is one of very few graduate student conferences in political theory around the United States. Harvard also hosts similar graduate conferences in international history and philosophy.

The aroma of Indian food welcomed guests entering the Phillips Brooks House yesterday afternoon, as a man dressed in white linen sat grinning on a red leather couch.
The man, Lavanam—whose name means “salt” in Sanskrit—had come to speak on the state of secularism in India.
The Humanist Chaplaincy at Harvard and Greater Boston Humanists invited Lavanam to Harvard on what may be his last visit to the United States.
A recent National Awardee for Social Programs by the Indian Government and the current Director of the Atheist Centre in India, the octogenarian spoke of the positive role of atheism in modern society.
“We need to humanize the dehumanized individual and re-socialize the institution,” he said several times.
According to Lavanam, atheism can achieve this goal by shifting the focus from theism to human beings.
“To be good and to do good, God is not necessary,” he said.
Lavanam also filled his speech with personal anecdotes of his father’s relationship with Mahatma Gandhi and his experience growing up as a “born atheist.”
Speaking of his experience as a young man teaching members of untouchables—the lowest level in India’s caste system—he noted that “we need to unite people, get rid of hatred, fear, poverty and inequality.”
According to Sarah J. Chandonnet, the Humanist Chaplaincy’s campus organizer, “One of the big challenges is seeing that atheism has gone on for thousands of years.”
Lavanam agreed.
“Atheism is as old as India itself,” he said.
“Let us not go back, let us go forward, let us make the human being the center of our social action in society,” he added.

There is a growing movement in architecture toward social activism, according to design activist and current Loeb Fellow Bryan Bell.
Architects are recognizing their responsibility to use their skills in community projects, Bell said in a speech at the Graduate School of Design on Friday.
“The collective consciousness of design is changing,” he said.
Bell added in recent years, designers have begun serving more of the general public, taking on a greater number of issues, and embodying a greater scope of roles.
Designers, who have “a superhero ability to see things that aren’t there,” can harness these skills to improve the community, said Bell.
However, Bell said, these skills are often underused.
“Architecture and the design professions have so much unrealized potential,” he said.
According to Bell, only 2 percent of home buyers employ an architect, adding that architects have a duty to serve the 98 percent of citizens who would not otherwise have a professional to help them design their space.
Bell emphasized architects can help create positive change in all realms of social activism.
“I assert here that every issue is a design issue,” Bell said. He cited existing design projects to improve access to drinking water, resist natural disasters, cure jaundice, protect wildlife, and address literacy and immigration.
There is no sacrifice of design quality in public interest architecture, Bell added. Maintaining that beauty and service are interconnected, Bell said he aims to create “the most beautiful, well crafted design I can” in every project he takes on.
Bell also made it clear that design activism is already a burgeoning movement.
“This is not something proposed for the future,” he said. “This is already happening.”
Although Bell said he is pleased by the progress that has been made, he called for greater activism among design students and architects.
“The massive shift we need will only happen by many of us becoming activists,” Bell said. “The need is undeniable. The only thing stopping us is us.”
Audience member and second-year School of Design student Laura Janka said that social activism presents an opportunity for architecture to reverse its elitist image. “We’ve missed something in society, and now we have this chance to fix it,” she said.
Victor M. Sanz, a second-year student at the School of Design who also attended the speech, said Bell’s work is challenging traditional notions of what design can accomplish. “Architecture is not about working in an office,” he said. “It’s about something bigger.”

Students, adults, and other members of the Harvard community packed into Leverett Dining Hall on Saturday night to enjoy Kalpanam, an annual classical dance performance put on by the Harvard South Asian Association, following a hiatus last year.
The show, under the theme “The Rebirth of Love,” kicked off with a musical performance, which was followed by several dance pieces, each showcasing various styles of traditional South Asian dance. This year’s Kalpanam featured 16 dancers and two musicians, and was organized by SAA board members.
The theme of this year’s show was particularly apt because Kalpanam was not performed last year, according to the show’s director Juhi R. Kuchroo ’13. Planning for the 2010 show has been a long time coming—the SAA made the decision to put on the show May of this year, and the performers have been rehearsing the acts since September.
In past years, the show focused solely on Bharatanatyam, a style of dance from South India, according to Kuchroo. She said she wanted the show this year to explore other styles of South Indian dance such as Tabla, Kathak, and Kuchipudi. This year’s Kalpanam also began with a classical Indian music performance, yet another new feature.
Ashin D. Shah ’12, SAA co-president who is also a Crimson photo editor, said the SAA hoped to use Kalpanam in part to highlight their efforts “to create a more open space on campus for the arts.”
One way that the SAA met this goal, Shah said, was by making tickets free.
Kuchroo, who danced in and choreographed for the show as well, said that the purpose of making Kalpanam free was “to attract more people to come and experience the culture.”
Kuchroo also said that the SAA made extensive efforts this year to publicize the event. In addition to regular postering efforts and sending out information over mailing lists, the SAA also publicized at graduate schools and reached out to other South Asian communities in Boston.
“I hope that we can do [Kalpanam] again next year, and that we have a good turnout,” Kuchroo said.

Harvard Students for Pakistan hosted a cultural event on Saturday to spread awareness of the catastrophic floods in Pakistan and raise funds for the approximately 21 million victims.
The event, which was co-sponsored by the Woodbridge International Society, featured Pakistani cuisine, poetry readings, and performances of traditional folk music from the region. Pakistani handicrafts were also on sale to raise money for flood relief.
Hania S. Chima ’14, a member of Harvard Students for Pakistan, led a presentation about the country’s condition before and after the disaster, which had left 8 million people homeless, destroyed more than 1.6 million acres of land, and exposed about 3.5 million children to water- and insect-borne diseases.
Beyond informing attendees of the crucial nature of the ongoing crisis, the organizers also sought to provide an accurate portrayal of Pakistan’s cultural identity, according to Nur N. Ibrahim ’13, the chief organizer of the event.
“The fact that the Pakistani foreign minister recently visited Harvard shows that the entire nation is extremely committed in helping the flood victims,” Ibrahim said. “We need to show the world that Pakistan is much more than what the media portrays us as.”
Mariam Chughtai, president of Harvard Pakistan Student Group at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, said in an interview she was concerned about the sustainability of efforts to raise awareness of the crisis in Pakistan.
“Pakistan’s issue is bigger than Haiti, Tsunami, and Katrina combined,” she said. “However, we have received very little attention.”
“The primary objective of our campaign is not to raise money, but to consolidate efforts that can ensure sustained engagement on the Pakistani crisis in the long run,” she said.
As a result, the Pakistan student groups across Harvard hope to encourage 5,000 people to donate $1 or more and use this solid foundation of support to create a database of individuals who will keep Pakistan “alive in their minds,” Chughtai said.
Or Gadish ’11, vice president of the Woodbridge International Society, said the Pakistani flood crisis has not received much attention in the United States.
He attributed that lack of attention to a correponsing lack in media exposure.
“Because we think this hasn’t gotten enough media exposure, we are organizing this even to inform people of the severity of this issue,” Gadish said. “There are 8 million people that need urgent medical exposure in Pakistan right now.”

The Harvard College Women’s Center held its inaugural New England Women’s Center Conference this past weekend, during which participants discussed how to most effectively run a collegiate women’s center.
Conference participants included women’s center directors and student staffers from colleges and universities such as Middlebury College, Greenwich Community College, Bentley University, and Lesley College in Cambridge.
Breakout session dialogues ranged from how to publicize that women’s centers welcome all genders to how to gain more visibility on campus to how to prevent sexual violence.
“The purpose of this conference is to build a sense of solidarity among women’s centers, and to use our collective knowledge to increase the impact of what each of us can do,” HCWC Susan B. Marine wrote in an e-mail. “Women’s centers have a unique mission on a college campus, and it’s easier to talk about challenges among those who already understand them and can strategize together about solutions.”
Throughout the two-day conference, participants discussed how third-wave feminism—a term that encompasses feminist activism from the 1980s onward—has also fought against other forms of bigotry, such as racism and homophobia.
Bradley L. Craig ’13, a Center intern, highlighted in his keynote speech the importance of the Harvard women’s center.
“At Harvard, a school where the politics of space run wide and deep, the importance of the space of the women’s center can not be overstated,” Craig said. “The Women’s center represent the University’s commitment to the well-being of the entire student body. The women’s center bring [students] together by emphasizing what unites us instead of what makes us different.”
For Nicole Macheski, a student staffer for the women’s center at Greenfield Community College, the conference led her to recognize the potential of a women’s center to provide resources for groups other than women.
“Being at a community college, our center is a small space where women come together, but I’ve learned here through discussion with these other women how centers can be used to address other issues such as sexuality and race,” Macheski said.
Participant Paula M. Chandoha, a board member for the Cambridge-based nonprofit Theological Opportunities Project, echoed Craig’s earlier sentiments.
“This conference has confirmed to all of us that women’s centers are integral to the community, especially in a university setting,” she said.

Renowned jazz bassist Cecil McBee spoke about his creative and personal history during an informal conversation moderated by Director of Bands at Harvard Thomas G. Everett at the New College Theatre last Friday.
McBee, a faculty member at the New England Conservatory, is admired for broadening the musical possibilities of the string bass and in particular for transforming the string bass from the rhythmic backbone to a fully expressive instrument in a band.
“You don’t choose the instrument, it chooses you,” McBee said, when asked how he became one of the most innovative jazz bassists associated with post-hop—a genre that relies heavily on improvisation and to which he has profoundly contributed.
The intimate talk included snippets of McBee’s compositions, which were played for the audience in order to showcase specific musical innovations in McBee’s work.
McBee has performed and recorded with a diverse array of artists, such as Miles Davis, Alice Coltrane and Benny Goodman, and is himself a serious composer.
McBee told of how he began his musical career by playing the clarinet in high school. Stepping over a dusty, old instrument in order to store his clarinet one day, he suddenly noticed what was in his way—a string bass.
“For years I’ve been reaching over it, and didn’t know,” McBee said, “so I picked it up and tried to play.”
His bass skills improved rapidly, and he soon began to perform in the local scene in his hometown Tulsa, where there was a demand for bass players.
McBee recounted how, growing up in a segregated society, the night music scene seemed to cross racial boundaries: white cowboys on Cainsville, MI’s bar music scene “showed [him] how to play rhythm changes,” taking him up to “the next level from the Blues.”
Another source of inspiration came from McBee’s grandmother, a devout Christian, who “got the Spirit” during church services one day and grabbed hold of McBee’s arm.
“And I felt the touch of God,” McBee said, adding that he often felt gripped by the same creative spark when playing his music.
When asked whether he was aware of innovating the way that string bass was played in the sixties, McBee pointed to Slug’s in New York City, a thriving jazz club in the East Village, as a venue where he was able to develop his musical style.
“We were doing something that was very, very different [and] people were listening seriously,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Republican Club aims to correct the ways students might be “Wrong About the Right” in a campaign launched this morning.
“The goal of our campaign isn’t necessarily to spark debate, but rather to publicize that there is an HRC on campus whose political beliefs might match your own,” said Luis A. Martinez ’12, the Harvard Republican Club vice president for speakers and political discourse.
Additionally, “Wrong About the Right” is intended to eliminate misconceptions about the Republican party and “let everybody know that the HRC is here to engage in dialogue,” Martinez said.
According to Martinez, the club plans to use social media to blanket the campus.
Aaron C. Gyde ’14, who spearheaded the effort, said in addition to creating a Facebook event, they will run ads on Facebook and in The Crimson and tweet from the newly created Twitter account, wrongabtdaright.
Starting this morning, and continuing throughout the week, members will be hanging posters, handing out flyers outside the Science Center, and sending out a video over House and dorm lists.
The flyers are meant to convey that the Republicans want to be seen as the “party of yes,” instead of the “party of no,” Martinez said.
The flyers say “YES,” above a word—such as Freedom, Opportunity, or Immigration—and the Republican elephant.
The video shows club members explaining why they are Republicans to bring a more human element to the party.
“We’re real people with real reasons for our beliefs,” Gyde said.
The video ends with Mark A. Isaacson ’11, the president of the HRC, saying, “I’m a Republican because I think... Well, that’s it.”
The club has discussed the campaign since early September at the weekly Speakers and Political Discourse committee meetings. Freshmen conceived of and organized the campaign, Martinez said, adding that he thinks this makes it more effective than if club leaders had handed down a plan.
Harvard College Democrats President Jason Q. Berkenfeld ’11 is skeptical about the effect this campaign will have on campus.
“At the end of the day, the vast majority of this campus is progressive,” he said. “At the end of the day, the vast majority of this campus knows what the Republican party stands for, which is overwhelmingly contradictory to the values that we care about most as students.”
Martinez said he hopes the Republican Club’s campaign will demonstrate that Republicanism “is not a manifestation of your worst nightmare.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At a turnaround elementary school in Hyde Park on Saturday, a group of Harvard Graduate School of Education students teamed up with a local public service organization to help brighten the hallways with inspiration.
For the project, coordinated by the Graduate Students in Various Efforts of Service program of the Ed School Student Affairs Office, students painted the hallways of Elihu Greenwood Leadership Academy with quotations about learning, self-expression, and cooperation.
The Boston chapter of City Year—a service organization founded by two Harvard Law School roommates that focuses on leadership development—spearheaded the quote selection process and outlined each letter across the walls prior to Saturday’s engagement.
The hallways at the Leadership Academy, which was named one of 12 turnaround schools in Boston Public Schools, were carefully lined with quotations from notable figures such as Barack Obama, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Dr. Seuss.
“If we can paint some inspirational quotes, bring up the school physically, then we can bring up the school in other ways,” said Clint D. Ficula, the GIVES coordinator. “They’ve been doing that already academically.”
GIVES, which began three years ago, is a program sponsored by the Ed School Student Affairs Office that creates opportunities for students who wish to participate in community service. Ficula coordinates efforts with other organizations to work with homeless shelters, families in need, and other local community service projects.
“We’re trying to get people excited about service,” Ficula said. “We’re in education to give back.”
For Claire J. DeBord, a student at the Ed School who was on the painting trip, the potential reactions of the elementary school students when they return to school on Monday excited her most.
“I think it shows the importance of crating an environment that encourages students, encourages learning,” she said of the project. “A lot of education is about the subtleties.”
Ed School student Nora D. Maginn echoed the sentiment when she reflected on the problems in public school education discussed in her classes: “This is a small thing to do to change a kid’s day,” she said.
The GIVES program has more service projects lined up for the end of the semester and the spring, including a Christmas Drive at the beginning of December.
“I want [GIVES] to have forward progress,” Ficula said. “I want it to be something that builds and builds, and people start to hear about it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a 23-7 win over Columbia in the books, the Harvard football team is in a place many skeptics thought it wouldn’t reach after its embarrassing 29-14 Ivy-opening loss at Brown. Though the Crimson hasn’t always been brilliant, it has found a way to grind out four straight Ivy wins, and heading into the last two weeks of the season, it’s in control of its own destiny.
Harvard has proved all season that it can adapt its offense to almost any opponent, rolling out a balanced attack that has leaned one way or the other depending on what’s working. In the middle of the season, the tailback tandem of senior Gino Gordon and sophomore Treavor Scales picked up the slack when injuries had decimated the aerial attack. Now that junior Collier Winters is back under center, the Crimson’s passing game has become more and more proficient.
And its defense has been getting stronger by the game—particularly in the red zone. Though Harvard gave up nearly 400 yards of offense on Saturday, the Crimson defense held Columbia to just seven points, its lowest scoring output of the season.
But as its matchup with Penn looms, Harvard is facing a dangerous opponent—one that, at least on paper, appears to be beating the Crimson at its own game.
In both total offense and defense, Harvard and the Quakers stand ahead of the rest of the league. The Crimson’s got the edge on offense, averaging 409.4 yards and 28.9 points per game to Penn’s 401.2 and 28.1, although the Quakers have slipped ahead in the rushing stats.
But the Penn defense has outperformed Harvard’s thus far, giving up just 15.5 points and 265.2 yards per game compared with the Crimson’s 16.5 and 309.2. And the Quakers’ rushing defense? The best in the FCS.
Throw in Penn’s home-field advantage and tougher schedule to date—its one loss came at the hands of No. 3 Villanova, while Harvard has lost to Brown and Lehigh—and the Quakers’ perceived advantage grows bigger.
And lest we forget, even if the Crimson can get the job done at Franklin Field next week, that doesn’t guarantee an Ivy crown. Harvard still has to beat Yale—now 4-1 in Ivy play after edging Brown on Saturday—to have a legitimate shot at the title.
The Crimson’s moving down the right path to take down Penn. It has figured out a way to win in a variety of situations, and it seems to have learned something from its pair of losses.
But if the Quakers are going to fall, it’s going to take a perfect storm. Freshman placekicker David Mothander needs to return to form, the defense needs to play as well outside the red zone as it has inside it, and Winters, Gordon, and the receiving corps need to step up the intensity a notch.
If it takes the Crimson nearly a half to settle into a rhythm at Franklin Field, you can bet Penn’s going to seize that opportunity.
There are no more gimme games, there is no more margin for error. The last time Harvard played an opponent this talented, it underperformed (to say the least). The Crimson is a more mature, cohesive team now than it was at the end of September, but it’s still a team missing two of its top receivers.
Though Harvard coach Tim Murphy and his team may ascribe to the one-game-at-a-time mentality, next weekend’s game is bigger than any other thus far on their schedule. And Harvard’s going to have to play better than it has all season if it intends to win it.

The remarkable thing about reunions between friends is how little time changes their friendship. While the No. 10 Harvard women’s hockey team’s reunions with No. 2 Cornell and Colgate may not have been friendly, it seems that little has changed about the Crimson’s relationships with the two squads. Once again, Harvard (2-1-1, 2-1-1 ECAC) found itself in between the two teams, falling to the Big Red (6-1-0, 4-0-0), 3-0, and topping the Raiders (3-7-0, 1-3-0), 3-1.
“I think [the weekend] went pretty well,” tri-captain Kate Buesser said. “We got two out of four points—obviously our goal is to get four points. We played a very good team in Cornell and an up-and-coming team in Colgate. Overall, it was an improving weekend.”
HARVARD 3, COLGATE 1
The Crimson didn’t register its first goal of the weekend until the second period against the Raiders. But by the end of Saturday’s game, Harvard started looking like its old self again, scoring once in the second period and twice in the third to rally from an early deficit in Hamilton, N.Y.
Taking advantage of a slow start by the Crimson, Colgate sophomore Jenna Klynstra slammed the puck past Harvard sophomore goaltender Laura Bellamy 12:33 into the game.
It was the third power-play goal the Crimson had allowed in the two-day stretch.
And for 20 minutes of ice time, it looked like Harvard might be heading home empty-handed.
But midway through the second period, Buesser took the game into her own hands, sending the puck past Raiders netminder Kimberly Sass to even the score.
“I think the first period we didn’t come out as strong as we wanted to,” said sophomore Jillian Dempsey, who assisted on the play. “I was really proud of how we turned that around, instead of just rolling over...we picked it up, we got more aggressive, we put up goals on the board.”
In the second and third periods, the Crimson dominated the puck, outshooting Colgate in each frame. Five minutes into the third period, Harvard finally took the lead when rookie Kalley Armstrong knocked a rebound into the cage. Armstrong was assisted by classmate Marissa Gedman and senior Ashley Wheeler on the first goal of her collegiate career.
Five minutes later, tri-captain Leanna Coskren added an insurance goal to put the Crimson up by two in a period in which Harvard outshot the Raiders, 13-2.
“I think it has a lot to do with preparation,” Buesser said. “We spend a lot of time getting ready for the third period both physically and mentally. Coach always says the first thing to go when we’re tired is our [mental game]. She’s done a good job making sure we keep sharp by working on our conditioning.”
CORNELL 3, HARVARD 0
Five is greater than four.
On Friday night, the difference between the two nationally ranked teams was a simple case of math: the Big Red skaters had seven power play opportunities to score and capitalized on two man-up chances, while the Crimson was shut out in two power-play chances.
“We shot ourselves in the foot by having too many penalties,” Buesser said. “You can’t do that. We know they’re very skilled on the power play. We need to play our game and not give them chances like that.”
Cornell—which was playing without star forwards Rebecca Johnston and Brianne Jenner, both of whom were absent due to Canadian national team commitments—didn’t waste time taking advantage of Harvard’s penalties. On its first power play of the game, Big Red senior Hayley Hughes sent the puck past Bellamy for what would prove to be the game-winner.
“It was a pretty back and forth game pretty much into the first goal,” Buesser said. “We were in their zone all over them...After they got on the board, they were able to tighten up defensively.”
And in the second frame, Cornell finally found its way past the Crimson at full strength, when senior Amber Overguard scored on a Hughes assist in the second period. Hughes picked up her third point of the evening five minutes later, assisting on Lauriane Rougeau’s power-play tally to secure a three-goal lead with 23 minutes of ice time remaining.
But from that point on, it was Harvard that dominated play. While it had nothing to show for its efforts, the Crimson did manage to outshoot the Big Red, 11-5, in the final frame.
“We were all over them,” Dempsey said. “It was kind of frustrating, [because] we didn’t feel that we deserved to lose because of how we played. We played physical, we played aggressive.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Kyle Richter kept bending and bending, until he finally broke.
The senior goalie did all he could to keep his team in the game, but in the end, the Harvard men’s hockey team was unable to keep up with a high-powered Union attack for most of Friday evening, falling, 2-1, in the team’s season opener at the Bright Hockey Center.
Richter was outstanding for much of the night, making 33 saves in the defeat. He faced a consistently heavy Union attack that featured 11 shots on net in every period.
The senior was under pressure the entire contest, starting from the first four minutes, in which he had to make a string of enormous kick saves. The Dutchmen dominated the first period, outshooting the Crimson, 11-3, but Richter kept his team in the game, sliding all over the ice to deflect shot after shot.
“It was definitely a busier night than I [usually] like,” Richter said.
In the second period, after an extended offensive barrage, Union finally got to Richter when forward Kelly Zajac fired a shot off a rebound over the goalie’s right shoulder for his ECAC-leading sixth goal of the season.
In the third, at 11:43, Richter made a huge save diving across the goal to his right, drawing a big ovation from the crowd and denying Dutchman forward Josh Joorish to keep his team within one.
“I knew it was [something] they liked to do on that particular play,” he said. “I was aware that the guy was sitting back-door in the slot area...the linemen allowed me to see the pass and get an opportunity to make the save.”
Though Richter later allowed the winning goal—a power-play one-timer blasted through the zone by Union defenseman Greg Coburn—the goalie made a statement that after an up-and-down 2009-10, his strong play was here to stay.
“Richter was outstanding for us,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “[He] kept us within one shot...[he] gave us a chance to be in the game.”
FRESH BLOOD
After losing defensemen Alex Biega ’10, Jack Christian ’10, and Chad Morin ’10 to graduation, Harvard was left with a lot of youth defensively behind senior co-captain Chris Huxley and junior Ryan Grimshaw. Two freshmen, Dan Ford and Danny Fick, join sophomores Danny Biega and Brendan Rempel to form a very young back line.
On the whole, despite some struggles—like allowing Coburn to get open off a faceoff before his goal—and despite giving up a large number of shots, the defense held its own in its first regular-season game playing together. There were clear signs of rustiness, and Ford and Fick each committed penalties during the game, but the defense seemed to gel as the contest went along.
“I thought the defense was pretty good at isolating shots, helping me control rebounds, and giving me chances to see as many pucks as I could,” Richter said.
Nonetheless, Donato said there were certainly things to tidy up on the defensive end.
“So far, I think our two freshman defensemen have played well,” Donato said. “[But] we’re in a position where not only our freshmen but our entire team needs to continue to improve.”
Richter commented that playing behind such a young defense has allowed him to take on more of a leadership role.
“It definitely comes with the territory, being a senior,” he said. “We all try to help each other out as much as we can, especially with a couple new guys in the lineup...they did a great job in September and October preparing themselves, so if they have questions, I’m happy to answer them and help them along, but I think they’ve done very well in the preseason and did a good job tonight.”
AN OFFENSIVE DEFENSE
It was Biega, a defenseman, who had the team’s only goal Friday. The sophomore took a pass from junior forward Daniel Moriarty in the top of the right circle, and after initially being denied, grabbed his own rebound and pushed the puck past Union goalie Keith Kinkaid for the tying score.
It was the second consecutive game in which a defenseman had Harvard’s lone goal after Grimshaw scored in an exhibition last week against Sweden. After the game, Biega said creating more chances for defensemen to score was something the team had worked on coming into the contest.
“Whenever we get chances, it’s definitely encouraged,” he said. “It’s just picking the right spots to hit...that’s something we’re going to look forward to and do more this year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The dreary weather on Senior Day ominously predicted the outcome of the game, but, as has been the case all season, the men’s soccer seniors delivered a few rays of hope.
Co-captains Jaren LaGreca and Robert Millock and fellow seniors Alex Chi, Shomesh Chaudhuri, and James Pelletier all played their final game at Ohiri Field on Saturday afternoon. Their opponent, the Columbia Lions, upstaged the memorable event, scoring in the first half and giving the Crimson backline trouble in the second period en route to a 1-0 victory. It was only after sophomore Richard Smith received a red card midway through the second half that Harvard reacted to the scoreboard and tried to overcome the deficit, but the Lions’ lead remained intact.
“It would have been nice to end the year and our careers here on a better note,” Millock said. “You know, last year, we only lost one game on Ohiri. The year before that, I don’t think we lost on Ohiri. It’s sad, but I guess it’s something that you always knew was going to happen, and it’s tough to really swallow, especially when it’s your last game.”
Before the game, the seniors were commemorated in a short ceremony where the players were individually introduced and then accompanied by their parents for a photo shoot. Almost 700 fans cheered on the graduating student-athletes, who over the span of their careers have won 42 games and boast a 16-7-3 record in the Ivy League.
The game began with both sides battling for possession. In the process, Columbia’s Nick Scott and sophomore Scott Prozeller were involved in a seemingly minor collision, but the Lion forward fell to the ground, unable to get up. The clock stopped at 41:44, and it took several minutes before Scott could get up again.
After the minor incident, the Crimson grabbed control of the game’s tempo for most of the first half, putting more passes together than the visiting side.
But two mistakes gave the crowd reason to worry. At 25:53, Columbia’s Will Stamatis easily stole the ball from Smith and ran down the field. Stamatis tried to find someone in the middle with a lob pass but to no avail.
Four minutes later, junior goalkeeper Austin Harms fumbled a save, and a Lion almost connected with the ball before it was played out of bounds. Harms handled an ensuing corner kick with ease.
It took two minutes for Harvard to respond with a chance of its own. A free kick almost reached Prozeller in position to score, but the ball was cleared out of the box, finding the feet of co-captain Millock. The senior crossed the ball back into the penalty box from the left in an attempt to connect with a sliding Chi, but the pass barely missed.
Eight minutes later, Stamatis once again caused trouble, stealing the ball from the defense and passing it to David Najem from the left. The Columbia freshman made his way towards the center of the field while the defense complained about an alleged handball. Najem took the opportunity to create a quick back-and-forth into the box before sending a strong shot past Harms.
This quick strike caused a shift in momentum that transferred over to the second half. The Lions came out running, causing the Crimson to intermittently shoot from afar or send long passes into the box. Prozeller took a long free kick in the 62nd minute that almost resulted in a header by freshman Pascal Mensah, but it sailed just high for the rookie.
At 71:19, Smith was the victim of another steal, this time by Francois Anderson, who immediately started sprinting down the field to go one-on-one with Harms. Smith, the last man in the back, tripped Anderson, resulting in a red card.
Even though Harvard was down a man, it was the Crimson making all the offensive plays late in the game—the closest ones coming from freshman Kyle Henderson. With 15 minutes left to play, freshman forward Connor McCarthy sent in a cross from the left, and Henderson carefully headed the ball towards the far post. The attempt narrowly went over the crossbar.
Ten minutes later, Henderson shot the ball from 30 yards out, but Columbia goalie Alexander Aurrichio caught the high and fast shot.
“Towards the end of the game, I thought we made a real commitment to trying to attack the goal,” Harvard coach Carl Junot said. “We played direct, and we got service from wide areas. So overall, a disappointing result, but it’s kind of been the story of our season. We come out playing strong, and because we don’t get a goal or anything productive early in the game, it makes it much harder in the second half.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After being eliminated from Ivy League title contention last weekend, the Harvard women’s soccer team didn’t have much to play for heading into its final conference matchup of the 2010 season.
But judging by the way the Crimson players stormed the field in celebration when the final whistle sounded, it certainly did not seem that way.
With a winning season at stake and a tough opponent in town, Harvard (8-7-1, 4-3 Ivy) felt like it had a lot to prove Saturday afternoon in its Senior Day contest against Columbia (9-5-3, 3-3-1) at Ohiri Field.
And the Crimson didn’t leave disappointed, coming away with a 2-0 win—and its fourth shutout of the season—against the Lions, a team that entered the contest one point ahead of Harvard in the conference standings.
“Playing against Columbia, they’re always a really great team, so we wanted to do our best, [and] we wanted to make a statement—and I think we did that,” senior Kerry Kartsonis said. “I think everyone—midfield, defense, forwards—just clicked. It was a great way to go out.”
After getting an early gift from its visitors thanks to a Lion own goal in the 10th minute, the Crimson held firm defensively for the remainder of the contest, limiting the visitors to just two shots on goal. In the 80th minute, co-captain Katherine Sheeleigh put the game out of reach with a late strike for her ninth goal of the season.
“The kid has done so much for this program,” said Harvard coach Ray Leone of Sheeleigh, who will finish her collegiate career fifth on the Crimson’s all-time scoring list. “It was great for her to go out like that.”
But until Sheeleigh’s late score, it didn’t look like either team’s offense was going to find the back of the net.
Defensively, Harvard focused its attention on stopping Columbia junior Ashlin Yahr, a 5’9” attacker who entered the matchup tied for second in the Ivy League with seven scores on the season.
But the Crimson shut down the attacker, limiting Yahr to zero shot attempts in 90 minutes of play, marking just the third time this season the junior was held without a shot.
“Both teams were kind of focusing on the attackers,” Leone said. “They were marking us, [and] we were marking them. I thought we did a pretty good job defensively.”
Harvard attempted to get past the Lion defense in the early going but was unable to connect on its runs. Soon enough, though, Columbia’s defense was there to help out.
In the 10th minute of play, sophomore Alexandra Conigliaro sent a cross into the box for Sheeleigh, who was cutting to the goal. Before Sheeleigh could get a foot on the cross, a Lion defender raced to the ball and attempted to boot it away. But instead of sending it out of harm’s way, the defender kicked the ball into the back of her own net, giving the Crimson a 1-0 lead.
Columbia had its best opportunity to even the score just minutes later when a Lion attacker fired a header from a deep cross that ricocheted off the post.
Late in the first half, Columbia had another scoring chance, when Chelsea Ryan collected a rebound in front of the goal. Ryan fired a shot at the goal, but the attempt sailed over the crossbar.
The home team tried to pad its lead with less than 11 minutes to play in the opening frame, as Conigliaro took a give-and-go from junior Melanie Baskind and fired a shot from several yards out. But Conigliaro’s attempt sailed over the cage, and Harvard went into the break clinging to a 1-0 lead.
The Harvard defense had one more scare with 20 minutes to play in the second, when Lion Natalie Melo received a cross five yards in front of the goal. Melo controlled the pass and turned to fire at the goal, but Kartsonis swooped in at the last second to deflect the ball out of bounds.
“I just saw the ball going out to someone, so I just ran out and got it,” Kartsonis said. “I don’t think too much when I’m playing.”
Ten minutes later, Sheeleigh gave the Crimson some breathing room.
In the 80th minute, Baskind sent a lead pass to Sheeleigh as she cut toward the goal. Columbia goalie Lindsay Danielson charged to the ball, but Sheeleigh got to it first and finished the score to put Harvard up, 2-0.
“Mel played me a perfect ball into the box,” Sheeleigh said. “It felt really good to slip it home.”
When the final whistle blew, the Harvard bench rushed onto the field to celebrate with the Crimson’s six seniors, who were on the pitch together for the final minute of play.
“This game was really just for the seniors,” Leone said. “I’m really proud of the performance they had today.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its season-opening matchup against No. 15 Union, the defense of the Harvard men’s hockey team was put to a serious test, as the Crimson struggled to generate shots on goal. The Dutchmen (6-1-2, 1-0-0 ECAC) took the contest, 2-1.
Before 2,374 rowdy fans, Harvard managed to put only 16 shots on goal, compared to Union’s 35, and spent most of the night defending its own zone.
Led by co-captain Chris Huxley and assistant captain Kyle Richter, the Crimson’s defense stood tall against the Dutchmen for the majority of the game, allowing just two of the 35 shots into the net.
“It’s pretty obvious that we got outplayed for most of the game,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “Union hemmed us in our end quite a bit. Our guys battled and were one shot away, even though we hadn’t played all that well in the first two periods.”
Indeed, the Crimson was lucky to escape the first period with the 0-0 score line still intact. The Dutchmen outshot Harvard, 11-3, in the period. The Crimson’s best opportunity came midway through the frame, when sophomore forward Luke Greiner broke away and went one-on-one with Union goaltender Keith Kinkaid, forcing him to come out of the cage to make the save.
After a scoreless first period, the Dutchmen took the lead 8:30 into the second, when Kelly Zajac stuffed the rebound from Adam Presizniuk’s shot behind Richter. The senior goaltender made a total of 33 saves on the night.
The beginning of the third period saw more back-and-forth play between the two teams before the Crimson came back to tie the game halfway through the period.
“Third period, definitely we saw a little more intensity,” sophomore defenseman Danny Biega said. “We were a little more desperate just to bury pucks and try to get some goals, so that definitely motivated us.”
Harvard’s only tally of the night came off of a strong effort from Biega. Nine minutes into the third, the second-year skater took the puck at the top of the right circle before firing a shot at net. Kinkaid made the save, but Biega quickly swooped in to gather the rebound and deflect the puck off Kinkaid’s stick and into the goal.
“It was a good play by [junior forward] Danny Moriarty to get the puck down low, and we just connected,” Biega said. “He made a great...pass right in the middle right to me, and I didn’t get my shot right away, but fortunately the puck stayed near. I got my own rebound off the net, [and] I redirected it back toward the net.”
But the momentum turned back in favor of the Dutchmen as the minutes died down. Freshman defenseman Danny Fick was whistled for holding with just over six minutes left to play. Presizniuk won the ensuing offensive-zone faceoff, finding John Simpson from the left dot. Simpson then passed the puck to Greg Coburn, who fired the shot past Richter.
The tally came just four seconds into the power play and put Union up, 2-1.
The score was a big blow to Harvard, coming after what seemed to be a comeback by the Crimson, and ultimately gave the Dutchmen the win.
Because it lost last year’s top two scorers—ECAC Rookie of the Year Louis Leblanc and Doug Rogers ’10—Harvard now faces a dearth of offensive firepower. In addition to being outshot, 35-16, on the night, the Crimson won just 17 out of 57 faceoffs.
“Talk about losing battles and races,” Donato said. “Our numbers on the faceoff circle were 17 [to Union’s] 40. We weren’t really ready to get enough positives going, our energy going, and our forecheck going to really turn the game in our favor.”
Though it was playing in its first game of the season against a more seasoned Union squad, the Crimson’s offensive shortcomings were reflective of something more than just early-season rust.
“We’re not about making excuses,” Donato said. “I don’t really see how playing nine games or 99 games should make a big difference in faceoffs and getting the pucks first.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Early in the season, Crimson coach Tim Murphy characterized his defense as a “bend-but-don’t-break” unit. Harvard has made a living of backpedaling as its opponent picks up yardage, only to stop the other team cold when it counts, and Saturday’s matchup with Columbia was no exception. The Crimson yielded 394 yards—the most it has given up all season—but a crucial red-zone turnover and a pair of botched field goals left the Lions with just seven points.
“The big thing we did is, even though we allowed some yardage, I thought we did a great job in red-zone defense,” Murphy said. “Any time you hold anybody to one touchdown in this league, or anybody on our schedule, you’re doing a pretty good job. I think that was the big thing of the game.”
Three of Columbia’s first four drives made it into Harvard territory, but the Crimson defense always seemed to respond. Late in the first quarter, with the Lions at their own 46, quarterback Sean Brackett rifled a throw to receiver Kurt Williams in the left slot that looked to set Columbia up deep in enemy territory. But junior safety Jonathan Mason laid a perfectly-timed hit on Williams, jarring the ball loose and falling on the fumble for a big turnover.
The second half started much the same way for the Lions, who drove 73 yards on their first possession before a tipped pass at the Crimson four-yard line landed in the hands of junior linebacker Alex Gedeon. Just like that, a statement drive for Columbia became another trademark moment for the Harvard defense.
“Defensively, they did some things that hurt us,” captain Collin Zych said. “They did a great job coaching in the second half, making some adjustments, but it was great to see that we were able to get off the field and to make plays when we needed to.”
Thanks to these big plays, the Crimson built a 23-0 third-quarter lead before Columbia finally reached the endzone. Despite an additional 104 yards in the fourth quarter, the Lions would not score again, making an otherwise tight game look like a blowout.
KICKING CONUNDRUM
When Harvard’s punt unit headed onto the field for the first time on Saturday, Columbia’s radio broadcast crew commented on the remarkable stockiness of the punter. That’s because, for the first time in his collegiate career, linebacker Gedeon—all 6’1” and 220 pounds of him—took on the starting punter role.
With usual sophomore starter Jacob Dombrowski suffering from a back injury, Murphy turned to Gedeon, who hadn’t booted a kick since moving to Cambridge.
“In high school, he was a quarterback, a defensive back, a linebacker, a punter—he never came off the field,” Murphy said of Gedeon. “And you want to recruit athletes, number one, kids that under pressure can do it. And number two, you want to recruit guys that are versatile, because you never have enough athletes.”
Gedeon certainly showed his versatility against the Lions, posting seven tackles and his key interception to go along with six solid punts. The junior averaged 36.8 yards per kick—two yards better than Columbia punter Greg Guttas—with a long of 47.
“I think being out there on defense definitely gets you acclimated to the situation,” Gedeon said. “It was a little bit different being 15 yards back and having a punt rush coming, but after the first one, I kind of settled down, and it was like riding a bike.”
Murphy was certainly happy to see his star linebacker settle into the dual role, as the timetable for Dombrowski’s return is unclear. For now, the coach stated that the job is Gedeon’s to lose.
Meanwhile, the Crimson must hope that the other side of its kicking game can find some consistency. Freshman plackicker David Mothander isn’t hurt, but he looked nothing like his dependable self on Saturday, when he missed a pair of field goals inside of 40 yards and bounced an extra point off the upright. Mothander was 8-of-11 on field goals entering the game against Columbia, but he pushed his first-quarter attempt wide right from 36 yards out before hooking a fourth-quarter try wide left from 34. The missed PAT was Mothander’s first of his rookie season. Still, Murphy seemed unfazed by his young kicker’s struggles.
“I think David was indicative of our team—we were on and off today,” the coach said after the game. “For a freshman, he’s done an outstanding job...Today he just didn’t have it, but he’s a legitimate athlete, legitimate kicker, and we’re happy to have him.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite firing 42 shots, Harvard and Rensselaer combined for only one goal in 60 minutes of play on Saturday night.
It just happens that the lone score came with 8.2 seconds left in the contest.
After losing its match against No. 15 Union the night before, the Crimson men’s hockey team (1-1-0, 1-1-0 ECAC) redeemed itself, defeating the visiting No. 18 Engineers (4-2-3, 1-1-0) in a tight contest at Bright Hockey Center.
Sparked by junior forward Alex Killorn’s buzzer-beating goal, Harvard earned its first victory against Rensselaer since 2008.
“It’s nice to start the season with a win against a team of that caliber,” Killorn said. “We’re pretty excited about that.”
The 83rd all-time matchup between the teams began uneventfully. The Crimson failed to capitalize on two power plays in the first seven minutes, and the Engineers followed suit, wasting two power plays of their own. Though neither team scored in the opening period, Rensselaer held the offensive advantage, tallying 16 attempted shots while Harvard managed only 10. The Crimson led in shots on goal though, 6-5.
The Engineers’ offense continued to threaten the Harvard back line in the second period. Twice, Rensselaer put the puck in the back of the net only to have the score called back: the first time, a high-sticking call invalidated the goal, and in the second instance the referees had blown the whistle and stopped play before the shot.
There were other close calls too. The Crimson survived two Engineer power plays in the period. As time wound down, Nick Bailen, a Rensselaer defender, nearly put the visitors on top after he fired a shot that clanged off of the post.
“I was pretty fortunate with those posts,” said assistant captain and Harvard goaltender Kyle Richter. “You love to hear that sound and look behind you and not see the puck in the net.”
Though the Crimson had the same number of shots as the Engineers during the middle frame, Harvard failed to supply the same level of pressure as Rensselaer’s offense. For the most part, the Crimson had a tough time keeping possession of the puck long enough while on the attack to string together multiple shots.
“That’s something we’re really going to have to concentrate on: how to manufacture some offense and get some more people around the net so we can get the so-called ‘dirty goals,’” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “You need those types of goals to be able to have a successful season.”
Many of the Crimson’s offensive struggles seemed to vanish with the opening of the third period. Harvard tallied six of the first seven shots in the frame and 11 overall, tying the team’s number of shots in the first two periods combined.
The Crimson executed its fifth successful penalty kill of the night 18:23 into the period, and only 16 seconds later, Harvard got a power play of its own. Unlike the visitors, the Crimson capitalized on the opportunity.
In less than a minute, Harvard fired five shots on the Engineer goal. It was the fifth one that proved to be game-changing.
With the clock winding down, sophomore forward Conor Morrison passed to senior Michael Biega, who threaded the puck past a Rensselaer defender to Killorn. Flanked by sophomore Danny Biega, the Crimson held a two-on-one advantage. Faced with the decision to keep it himself or pass to the younger Biega, Killorn chose the former option. Skating towards the right side of the goal, the forward slapped a shot that just snuck under the Engineer goaltender Allen York’s arm.
“I was looking at Danny to make the goalie think I was going to pass it and at the last second just [tried] to get off a shot as quick as possible,” Killorn said. “It ended up working out pretty well.”
Rensselaer failed to pull off a miracle in the 8.2 seconds after Killorn’s score, giving the Crimson a 1-0 victory. In the process, Harvard ended the Engineers’ seven-game unbeaten streak, which had been tied with Boston University’s for the longest streak in the nation.
Overall, the team was pleased with the performance.
“I think they really battled,” Donato said. “They blocked some shots, and ultimately, when [Rensselaer was] able to get through, [Richter] was there.”
“It was a great feeling in the locker room to know the season’s on and we can win games like that,” he added.
Richter, who totaled 19 saves in the contest, echoed Donato’s sentiments.
“The guys did a great job battling the storm for the majority of the game and really stayed patient,” the goalie said. “[We] didn’t let them dictate the play and let them control our emotions. We played our game, which I thought was a great step in the right direction.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This year, the end of daylight savings brought with it the end of the Harvard women’s volleyball team’s regular season road schedule. The Crimson (8-16, 5-7 Ivy) split the weekend, conquering Brown (8-6, 2-10), 3-2, but falling to Yale (16-7, 10-2) in three sets.
“Against Brown, we came out really strong, and we played together as a team,” said freshman middle blocker Teresa Skelly. “Against Yale, it was a really hard and intense game—we weren’t quite on.”
YALE 3, HARVARD 0
At home in the Lee Amphitheater, conference leader Yale proved too much for the visiting Crimson, as it nabbed each frame by a margin of at least seven points on Saturday night.
Harvard couldn’t recover from the dominant play of freshman Erica Reetz, who notched 13 kills and 11 digs, and junior Bridget Hearst, who followed close behind with 11 kills. Freshman setter Kendall Polan also dished out 23 assists in the match.
“Yale’s a talented team,” junior libero Christine Wu said. “We lost focus, and they outworked us. We couldn’t get a flow going throughout the night.”
The Bulldogs asserted their dominance early in the match, taking the first six points to jump out to an early lead. They likewise capitalized on an eight-point run in the second set to ultimately capture the first two frames with identical scores of 25-14.
“That’s been one of our problems that we’ve been battling with,” said Wu of the uninterrupted runs of points. “It’s a matter of focusing on every single point...to stop the other team from putting together these runs.”
The third stanza showed promise early for the Crimson—after juggling a couple of early leads, Harvard tied it up at 10. The squad also put up its best numbers, hitting at .087 for the frame. But the Bulldogs couldn’t be topped, hitting at over quadruple Harvard’s effort at a .368 clip. The crew captured eight of the next nine points to put the Crimson squad out of contention for the third set. Yale wrapped up the final game, 25-18.
A few bright moments in the tough loss were the performances of junior co-captain Anne Carroll Ingersoll and sophomore Taylor Docter.
Ingersoll, who rotates between middle blocker and outside hitter, led the team with eight kills, and Docter, an outside hitter, chipped in seven of her own. Sophomore setter Beth Kinsella also added 21 assists.
HARVARD 3, BROWN 2
Friday night at the Pizzitola Center saw a much better turnout for the Harvard women. The team turned out a thrilling 15-13 fifth-set victory to topple the Bears and conclude the nearly two-hour match.
“I think it was great that our team was able to pull it through,” Wu said. “We came out really well.”
The Crimson got off to a strong start, as, with fair ease, it captured the first two sets of the match. With the score at 24-20, Docter put down one of her 22 kills on the night to give Harvard the first stanza. At 21-16 in the second set, she again came through and added three clutch kills to help lift her team to a 25-16 victory.
“Taylor lit it up on Friday,” Wu said. “She really shined when we needed her. She stepped up and stepped into a leadership position.”
But Brown answered with a strong rally in the third set. After tying it up at nine apiece, freshman Emma Pastore and sophomore Katrina Post carried the Bears to a 25-19 win.
The crew carried its momentum into the fourth frame as well. The Crimson closed the gap and came within a point of its opponent at 21-20, but Brown, hitting at .216 to Harvard’s .171, evened the match at two-all with a 25-21 victory.
Playing for the win, both teams seemed relentless as the fifth set progressed. Neither team won more than two points at a time, as the score knotted itself at three, four, six, seven, eight, 10, 11, and 13 points apiece.
After a Crimson timeout, it was Docter who sealed the Bears’ fate.
Hitting .432 on the evening, Docter put away two consecutive kills at net to push Harvard to victory.
“Taylor had a spectacular showing,” Skelly said. “[She] was able to fire up our team and keep us motivated.”
On top of Docter’s standout performance, other Crimson athletes had solid nights as well.
Sophomore Jennifer Martin registered 10 kills hitting outside, and junior middle hitter Sandra Lynne Fryhofer chipped in nine. Kinsella added 41 assists and Wu also chipped in 29 digs—good for best on the team.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two tough losses, including a two-point defeat and a tiebreaker, sent Harvard back to Cambridge without a win in the ITA Indoor National Championships and closed the Crimson’s fall season this weekend. Doubles pair junior Alistair Felton and sophomore Andy Nguyen lost to teams from the University of California, Berkley and UCLA.
“We were excited because we were there last year, and it’s very exciting to see that type of skill level,” Nguyen said. “Our doubles positioning has improved a lot. We feel like we can hang with some doubles teams from across the country.”
The pair lost their first match of the tournament, 9-7, last Friday to the Cal Golden Bears’ Nick Andrews and Christoffer Konigsfeldt. After gaining an early service break, Harvard appeared to have the upper hand, but the Golden Bears took control through a number of accurate lobs as the game went on. Berkley gained strength from its accuracy in both serves and returns as well, which helped lead the Golden Bear tandem to victory by targeting areas that the Crimson was not expecting.
“They had two chip return lobs that landed right on the line and caught us off guard,” Nguyen said. “We felt like could have beat them, so it was really disappointing.”
Harvard hoped to redeem itself after its first loss but fell just short. Felton and Nguygen were defeated by UCLA’s Amit Inbar and Nick Meister on Saturday. Although the Crimson held its own against the Bruins, the pair lost, 9-8 (7-5), to the sixth-ranked pair, even after a slow start. Felton lost his serve at the start of the game, starting the pair at a disadvantage, but halfway through the match, Harvard broke back at 4-4.
The Crimson gained a competitive edge through some volleys and accurate positioning that increased Harvard’s control of the net toward the end of the match. After the break at 4-4, Harvard continued to gain points and hold onto the momentum until the tie breaker.
“It was just so close!” Nguygen said. “With a change of serve, anything could happen.”
The UCLA duo has a strong history in singles games as well as doubles. The pairing led to a powerhouse doubles team. Nguyen said he could appreciate his competitor’s skill, especially under the pressure of a tiebreaker.
“I guess that’s why they’re the No. 6 [team]. They’re good in those pressure-time situations,” Nguyen said. “We just need to be in those situations more often, and we would improve a lot.”
Felton and Nguyen are headed in the direction of those situations. The pair has one more year to play together after the end of this spring season. While the tournament might have been frustrating, it indicates a strong fall season for the Crimson.
“On the one hand, it was really disappointing, but on the other, it’s the sign of good things to come,” Nguyen said. “Our other doubles pairings are just as good as we are, so it’s a good sign for our doubles teams.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After 26 matches, two injured captains, and three days of intense competition, the Harvard Women’s tennis team finished its home invitational with 15 victories to conclude its fall season.
The Crimson started the tournament aggressively, winning all three doubles matches in the morning against the Air Force Academy.
The doubles selection for this tournament was challenging because junior co-captain Holly Cao, ranked team-best and the 56th best in the nation, was injured. Cao is recovering from a recent surgery and is expected to return to play shortly.
“I feel like we got a chance to mix some doubles teams around, so people got a chance to play with a different partner,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “So it’s good for the coaches and the players to play with different people out there with different roles.”
In the afternoon, the Crimson lost four of the six singles matches. Junior Samantha Gridley finished off her match with a tiebreak, winning, 6-4, 1-6, 10-6. Sophomore Hideko Tachibana won hers in consecutive sets with a score of 6-3 and 7-6 (4).
On Saturday morning, Harvard claimed two of the three doubles matches over Syracuse. Crimson co-captain Samantha Rosekrans and rookie Hannah Morrill defeated their opponents, 8-2. Alex Lehman and Amanda Black also won their match with a score of 9-7.
Later in the afternoon, the Harvard women outplayed their Air Force opponents in each of the five singles matches. As a result of Cao’s absence, the first court was occupied by Tachibana, ranked 114th nationally. Tachibana made quick work of her opponent Christen Monreal.
During the first set, Tachibana and Monreal participated in a number of long rallies, but Tachibana gained the upper hand, taking the set, 6-2. The second set saw much shorter points, though, with Tachibana clinching the match with a score of 6-1.
“I just got into the match, and I got more confidence from the first set,” Tachibana said.
In contrast, sophomore Kristin Norton was the first Crimson player to win a set but struggled in the second. After winning the opening frame, 6-1, Norton fell behind in the second, 6-5, before rallying to win the next game and the tiebreak, 9-7.
“We got a chance for people who don’t normally play as high up to play high,” Green said. “Hideko Tachibana and Kristin Norton did a good job of stepping up and trying to show leadership out there.”
This weekend’s experience will help strengthen the team in the upcoming spring season and indicate where Harvard stands in terms of the Ivy League. Cornell and Brown also participated in the Harvard Invitational, giving the Crimson a glimpse of its future competition. On Saturday, Tachibana emphasized the team’s desire to establish a strong reputation for the season.
“[Harvard Invitational] is important because it will be a good indicator of how the Ivy League season will go. We need to put our best foot forward,” Tachibana said.
On Sunday, the team had that chance to make an impression, taking on both Ancient Eight opponents in singles. The tension of the singles tournament was almost palpable as junior Samantha Gridley and Brown’s Ariel Caldwell competed in a particularly intense and aggressive match. The two battled for victory with the teammates and coaches fixated on their game as all of the other matches were finished.
Gridley lost the final match of the tournament by a score of 6-3, 6-3, but overall, she added three victories to the Crimson’s tally.
The tournament confirmed to Green that the competition this year will be stiff for the defending Ivy League champions.
“We’re really excited to be playing in the Ivy League this year because it’s going to be very tough,” the coach said. “We’re just looking forward to taking it one match at a time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the first, third, and fourth quarters, the Columbia football team played the Crimson to a draw. But despite the strong play of Lions quarterback Sean Brackett, at the end of the day, the visitors wished they could have their second quarter back.
A 16-point surge by Harvard in the second frame turned an otherwise even match into a one-sided affair on the scoreboard, with the Crimson taking the contest, 23-7, Saturday at Harvard Stadium.
“It really was closer than the score indicated,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “We made some big plays, but I really felt like the game was closer than 23-7, a credit to Columbia.”
Harvard struggled on offense throughout the first quarter, finishing the frame with three punts and a missed field goal. The Lions had earned three more first downs and 22 more yards than the Crimson, and the cold November air was ripe with the chance of upset.
“I think it was a combination of some things we didn’t do particularly well, and some things they really do well schematically and physically,” Murphy said.
But Columbia had nothing to show for its first-quarter efforts, and Harvard began to find the winds to be favorable.
Powered by the ground game of senior Gino Gordon and sophomore Treavor Scales, the Crimson finally put together a string of first downs midway through the second frame. After the duo had propelled Harvard deep into Lion territory, junior Collier Winters tried to throw his way into the endzone. But after two incomplete passes brought up fourth and eight, the Crimson turned to freshman David Mothander, who had already missed a field goal attempt in the first quarter.
This time, the rookie drilled it through the uprights to put Harvard up by three.
For a fleeting moment, Columbia had a chance to regain the momentum when Lions senior Craig Hamilton picked off Crimson quarterback Collier Winters on a fourth-and-10 throw. But senior receiver Mike Cook was able to turn his classmate’s bad throw into a first down when he forced a fumble and recovered the football at Columbia’s 19-yard line. A minute and a half later, Gordon had scored a touchdown and Harvard had a double-digit lead with less than four minutes left in the first half.
“I think our tempo was really good,” Murphy said. “We started to hurry it up, not substitute as much, and I think we just wore them out, and when you wear them out a little bit you also surprise them a little bit. So I think we kept them off balance with our play-calling and our tempo, and I think that was the big difference in the second quarter.”
Though Gordon’s trip to the endzone put the Crimson ahead by fewer than two touchdowns, the outcome was never again in doubt, and around three minutes later it was Winters’ turn to strike. With the ball on the Lions’ three-yard line, the quarterback kept the ball to himself on an I-formation option play, heading for the left hashmark and diving into the endzone just as the Lions were starting to close in on him.
Winters’ run left only 37 seconds in the half, but that proved to be just enough time for Harvard to make one last statement from captain Collin Zych, who frustrated Brackett on each of the last two plays, batting one ball down and intercepting the next.
“You can’t dial it up, but we eventually got to where we wanted to be,” Murphy said.
One quarter of dominance proved to be enough for Harvard to send the Lions back to New York with a 16-point loss despite playing the Crimson even in the second half.
Harvard struck first in the third quarter when its offensive line paved a gaping hole for Scales, allowing the sophomore to run untouched through the line of scrimmage and into the endzone from 11 yards out.
But the ensuing PAT proved to be the Crimson’s final point of the game. From then on, Columbia was able to keep Harvard’s offense in check.
“I thought the defense played pretty good today,” Lions coach Norries Wilson said on Saturday. “Like I told them after the game, after I watch the tape, I might just drop the “pretty” and say they played good today. There were some tough situations, and the defense made a lot of stops today.”
And Columbia finally got on the board itself near the end of the third quarter when Brackett found Kurt Williams standing all alone in the endzone for a 36-yard strike.
“The touchdown was a missed assignment, which we’ve got to fix,” Zych said. “That can’t happen, but very correctable.”
The Lions’ trip to the endzone proved to be the final word on offense.
The game finished the way it started, with both teams failing to get on the board in the last frame.
But by the final whistle, one dominant quarter proved to be enough.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite a strong performance in the second half, the Harvard women’s field hockey team suffered a loss to Columbia at home on Saturday afternoon at Jordan Field. With the Lions (10-7, 3-4 Ivy) up, 3-0, in the first half, the Crimson (3-14, 1-6) bounced back ferociously in the second half but could not finish the comeback, losing to Columbia, 3-1. The loss marked the final game of the regular season and the final game for co-captain KJ Warren and fellow seniors Pilar Curtis and Chloe Keating.
“Columbia went up, 3-0, in the first half,” Harvard coach Sue Caples said, “and you can’t give a team a three-goal advantage. We were a little less than spectacular in the first half, but we had good energy and momentum in the second half. We just fell a little short.”
Harvard started the game with great control and took care of its possessions well. For the first 10 minutes of the match, the offense pinned down the Lions within their own circle. The Crimson had a great chance when freshman Christy Haughey made a pass right in front of the goal that went just wide of cutting sophomore Emma Keller.
But Columbia responded quickly to the emerging Harvard offense, and on a counterattack in the 13th minute, sophomore Gabby Kozlowski scored after collecting her own rebound from the post and shooting past sophomore Crimson goaltender Cynthia Tassopoulos. Kozlowski’s goal opened the flood gates, and just six minutes later Lions junior Carson Christus got a great pass from senior teammate Catlin Mullins and buried the ball into the Harvard net.
After Christus’ score, Columbia dominated possession and outshot Harvard, 11-1, in the first half. The Lions scored on a penalty corner shortly before the end of the half to increase the lead to 3-0.
The Crimson came out of halftime a completely different team. The offense made sharp passes into Columbia’s half and put the Lions on the defensive for most of the half. The defense also stepped up, making interceptions whenever Columbia attempted to counterattack. Harvard got on the board in the 58th minute following several close calls during a penalty corner. Keating took the pass from junior co-captain Carly Dickson and shot a bullet past Lions sophomore goalkeeper Christie O’Hara.
“We just went over what the game plan was and what we were trying to do,” Caples said about her team’s new-found energy. “[We discussed] our objectives with the ball in the backfield and the midfield and the attack and just reviewed it. [The girls just needed] a few reminders of what their roles and responsibilities are.”
From that point on, the match became a duel between the Crimson offense and Columbia’s defense, with the Lions holding on for the win. Harvard outshot Columbia, 9-5, in the second half with seven shots coming from penalty corners. O’Hara stepped up and made six saves, including several diving saves, to preserve the Lions’ lead and clinch the victory for Columbia.
“[O’Hara] was a big player for them,” Keating said, “especially the last 15 minutes of the second half. She really kept them in the game. We were really knocking on the door, but she proved to be kind of like a brick wall.”
Keating’s sixth goal of the season was also her 22nd-career goal, and she finishes her collegiate athletic career leading the team in points.
“It was bittersweet,” Keating said about her last game. “Everyone struggled with a lot of injuries all the way through, but we had a really great experience for the last four years. [We had] really great teammates, and my class is awesome. It was a really great four years.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s water polo wrapped up its season yesterday, placing fifth in this weekend’s CWPA Northern Championships at MIT. The Crimson, seeded fifth entering the tournament, won two out of its three games.
Harvard (12-16, 2-5 CWPA) fell in its opening game to Fordham (16-14, 4-3), 8-5, then bounced back to crush Connecticut College (4-13, 0-7) in its next match, 18-5. This mixed bag of results put the Crimson in position to capture a top-five finish in the tournament, a task it succeeded in as a result of its 7-6 victory over Iona (6-18, 2-5) yesterday.
“I was really proud of how the team played this weekend,” co-captain Bret Voith said.
HARVARD 7, IONA 6
Harvard jumped out to a 6-1 first half lead against Iona and then held on to clinch a 7-6 victory and fifth place in the tournament.
Senior Jeff Lee helped the Crimson offense, scoring twice in his last game for the team.
Defense also proved key in the contest against Iona, with junior goalie Alexandre Popp making 11 saves.
“[Yesterday]’s game was a great team effort,” Voith said. “During the third quarter, Iona wore down our lead, but we were able to hold them off. Our defense was solid today and allowed us to pull off the victory.”
Junior Kevin DiSilvestro also scored twice, helping propel Harvard to victory.
His goal in the third period protected the team’s advantage and helped to make up for a lack of Crimson scores in the fourth period. Popp contributed to Harvard’s offense as well, leading the squad with three assists on the day.
HARVARD 18, CONNECTICUT COLLEGE 5
In the team’s second game of the tournament, Voith had a standout performance in the water. He scored five of his nine goals of the weekend against Connecticut College in the Crimson’s rout.
Senior Alex Thompson led Harvard defensively, tallying six steals.
“Alex was great for us defensively,” Voith said. “He really allowed the rest of us to excel by clogging up the middle and shutting down the opposition’s post players. When you do that it makes everything else easier defensively. He did a great job for us and was key in our success.”
Junior co-captain Luka Babic also helped the Crimson to pour it on against the Camels, scoring four times. Including Voith and Babic, five of Harvard’s players scored multiple goals in the contest.
Assist duty was spread evenly among the team as four players chipped in with two apiece.
FORDHAM 8, HARVARD 5
In the Crimson’s first match of the weekend, the team fell to Fordham in a close decision.
“The loss against Fordham was disappointing,” Voith said. “But I think it speaks a lot to the character of everyone on our team to be able to bounce back from that first close loss and win the next two games. We ended our season on a strong note.”
First-year coach Ted Minnis echoed this sentiment when reflecting on Harvard’s play.
“I was really happy with the way we played this weekend,” Minnis said. “I was obviously disappointed with the outcome of the Fordham game. I thought we played better than them in every phase of the game.”
Voith led Crimson in all offensive categories against the Gaels with three goals and three assists. Thompson added another goal and led the team with three steals in the game.
Popp made seven saves for Harvard on the day, but it was not enough to keep Fordham from the victory.
But the weekend’s wins point to a successful end to the season and great potential for the Crimson’s future.
“I’m pretty happy with the outcome of our season,” Minnis said. “We had a very successful California trip. The guys worked hard and played hard for four quarters every game. I wish we could have advanced, but I’m really satisfied with the group of guys this year. The seniors will be proud of where the program is going.”

Harvard professor Michael J. Sandel hosted his own call-in show this Sunday in a live, interactive discussion via the telephone. The so-called “teleforum” brought Sandel's famous Ethical Reasoning 22 course to pre-registered listeners across the country. Each participant received a phone call at 5 p.m. this past Sunday and got tapped into the tele-classroom.
Produced by Farrar, Straus and Giroux and Broadnet, the discussion promoted Sandel's book “Justice: What’s the Right Thing to Do?” Participants submitted questions ahead of time and were also able to vote via keypad on key issues.
Sandel first asked the participants what they thought about the fairness of the distribution of wealth in America; the result was that 64 percent believed that it is unfair that the richest 1 percent of Americans account for 24 percent of income.
In the second half, Sandel directed the polling question to affirmative action, asking the participants if they thought it was fair that race and ethnicity enter into the admissions game at universities. These results were more equally distributed, with slightly more people voting that it’s fair to account for race and ethnicity.
Participants from both sides of the spectrum were called out to explain why they voted the way they did and got to debate directly with Sandel.
