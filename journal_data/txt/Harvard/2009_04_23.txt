After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Budget cuts are a dime a dozen these days and a basic fact of life during a recession, though we do hope the cuts end up saving us more than just a few dimes. Spending cuts are often unfortunate, especially at Harvard—a place accustomed to abundance. Yet these cuts are also probably highly prudent and necessary, though it is difficult to be sure, since the university’s true financial picture remains cloudy. The decision made earlier this semester to reduce annual FAS departmental budgets and annual House budgets by 15 percent was a difficult concession, but likely sensible in the current environment. The recent announcement, however, that each of Harvard’s 12 Houses will be required to cut spending by an additional 10 percent—25 percent in full—is especially regrettable, considering the vital role that House life should play in the Harvard undergraduate experience.
Of course, a student’s House is more than just a building in which she sleeps and eats. The Houses are vibrant intellectual and social communities, and it is concerning to see that they will now have fewer resources with which to enrich a student’s Harvard experience. A 25-percent drop in House spending will have a negative impact on both quality of life and on advising resources within the House—cuts that will go well beyond the loss of  luxuries like free refreshments provided at masters’ open houses and study breaks. House masters have said that tutor meal plans may have to be reduced and that some staff positions may have to be rethought entirely. 
Ironically, these additional housing budget cuts come on the heels of the recent Report on Harvard House Renewal, which specifically called for an increased tutor presence in each house and restructured Senior Common Rooms. The report was released to the community on April 1 in an e-mail from Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds. In a preface to the report, she writes that Harvard’s goal to “revitalize the House system” would still be pursued despite “challenging economic times.” But, surely, these planned renovations and improvements will now have to wait. In the meantime, the university should ensure that the organizational heart of College residential life still lies within the Houses, rather than in a larger, more centralized administrative bureaucracy. To do so will require prioritizing administrative staff salaries over other current luxuries offered by houses.
In the midst of such a dire financial situation, it is understandable that cuts need to be made, and a 25-percent cut is not likely to disappear anytime soon. In dealing with these cuts, the Houses should do what they can to ensure that the personal infrastructure of the House—specifically the continued presence of tutors and important House administrators—survive such a drastic budget reduction. Extras such as food for House events should be eliminated long before actual academic and administrative positions that play such a central role in the Harvard experience start to be considered expendable.

All good things must come to an end.
The Harvard men’s volleyball team (11-8, 6-2 EIVA Hay) ended its successful turnaround season last night, falling 3-1 (29-31, 33-31, 19-30, 26-20) in the first round of the EIVA playoffs to George Mason (12-15, 5-7 EIVA Tait Division) at the Field House in Fairfax, VA. The eighth-seeded Crimson was led by co-captains Brady Weissbourd’s 23 kills and junior Gil Weintraub’s 56 assists.
“They’re a very good team and have been for a really long time,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said. “It was going to be a tough match going in, but certainly we were excited to be in the playoffs in a while. We competed extremely well, but at the end of the day, we just couldn’t quite find the points we needed.”
Last night’s match against the Patriots marked the first time the Crimson has appeared in the postseason since 2005. In a matter of just one year, Baise has turned a struggling Crimson volleyball program into a rising power in its division, capturing a share of the EIVA Hay title along the way.
After a tough loss to Rutgers-Newark last week, Harvard gave the fifth-seeded Patriots a run for their money. Even with injuries affecting the play of the Crimson’s two key offensive players—Weissbourd and senior libero Jeff Nathan—Harvard started out the game competitive, keeping up point-for-point with George Mason’s explosive offensive sets. After leading 7-4 early in the first set, the Patriots went off on a 5-0 run, capitalizing on perfectly placed sets by setter Ryan Kwiakowski and two errors from Weintraub and junior Erik Kuld.
“We had a pretty slow start, and serving was tough for us,” Weintraub said. “I think we made a few too many errors and we gave up critical points at certain times.”
George Mason held on to a sizable lead throughout the majority of the first set. But just when it appeared that the Patriots had the first set in the bag, the resilient Crimson came back with a run of its own, outscoring George Mason 9-1 to tie the game at 29-29. But a kill from junior Ben Nichols and a ball handling error by freshman Dan Schreff would leave the Patriots unscathed and give the host team its first set victory.
“The first game could’ve gone either way,” Baise said. “I thought we were going to pull it out, but [George Mason] has some really good players, and they were able to put the ball down on the court.”
The second set was also marked by short-run spurts, with Harvard taking a 14-12 lead after a 4-0 run. Weintraub and Rosier made timely blocks on the front line, making two consecutive blocks during that run. 
With business taken care of on the defensive side of the court, freshman Matt Jones and Weissbourd took care of the rest. Two consecutive kills by Jones gave the Crimson a slim 22-18 lead, and it would be just enough for Harvard to pull out a 33-31 victory in the second set.
Like the two previous sets, the third was kept close early on, with Harvard down just two, 16-14. But George Mason would settle down and finish the set strong on a 11-4 scoring run.
“They started serving a little better and our passing wasn’t as strong,” Baise said. “We really needed to pass extremely well especially when we’re down. The third set was by far George Mason’s best game. We helped them out by making more errors than we should have.”
With the Crimson on the brink of elimination, the team turned to hitters Weissbourd and Jones for points. The two started off with easy kills, giving Harvard a 5-2 lead. However, the injury on Weissbourd began to take its toll in this crucial fourth set.
“There’s basically a big club on his left hand,” Baise said. “It definitely affected his defense, not so much his offense. He was hampered by it a little bit, and it hurt. He’s a real tough guy and he played through it, but there’s no denying that there were points that we gave away because of that injury.”
George Mason continued its strings of five-point runs in the fourth set. But the Crimson managed to answer this time. Down 17-19, it was now-or-never for Harvard, and a kill from Weissbourd ignited a Crimson run that gave the team a tight 23-22 lead. But even with Weissbourd’s outstanding efforts, the Patriots were simply too much for a depleted and injured Harvard squad to pull off the first round upset.
For now, the Crimson’s season ends here. But its success this year will hopefully be just the beginning of good things—and many championships—to come.
“I’m extremely proud of my players this year. We came together like I hoped they would,” Baise said.
“I think we’re really hopeful,” Weintraub said. “[Our returning players] will head us in the right directions. We have high expectations for next year.”—Staff writer Kevin T. Chen can be reached at ktchen@fas.harvard.edu

Change is in the air this spring, or at least it will be soon, as President Obama pursues “a new beginning with Cuba.” In remarks made at the Summit of the Americas in Trinidad and Tobago, Obama indicated his willingness to engage with the Cuban government in an effort to ameliorate U.S.-Cuba relations, which have remained chilly for half a century. And, prior to the summit, Obama broke with traditional policy by lifting restrictions placed on Cuban-Americans’ ability to travel to Cuba and send money to friends and relatives on the island.  
Obama has acted wisely in attempting to move past the vestigial Cold War animosity that seems to perpetually guide our Cuba policy, but we hope that he will follow up his warm gestures with concrete action.
The U.S. government’s new stance on Cuba carries great potential for improving America’s relationship with Latin America as a whole, a region that felt somewhat neglected by American foreign policy during the Bush presidency. But Obama needs to go further if he is to succeed in gaining lasting credibility with many Latin American leaders. 
Since being expelled in 1962 after the Cuban Missile Crisis, Cuba has been excluded from the Organization of American States, the group of 34 nations that meets at the Summit of the Americas every five years. Obama’s conciliatory words at this very summit will ultimately ring hollow unless the U.S. ends its opposition to Cuba’s membership in the OAS. If America is truly committed to redefining its relationship with Cuba and its allies such as Venezuela and Nicaragua, then it needs to give Cuba a seat at the table.
Furthermore, Obama should take the radical but logical step of lifting the U.S. trade embargo on Cuba. The harsh economic sanctions are a historical relic from past efforts to dislodge Cuban leader Fidel Castro, whom several presidential administrations—beginning in the 1960s—have tried unsuccessfully to shake from power. The sanctions may have actually had the opposite of their intended effect politically, allowing Castro to blame the U.S. for Cuba’s sluggish economic development. As disagreeable as Castro’s actions toward America may have been, an embargo rooted in personal enmity against this single political leader is no longer a practical foreign policy. 
In fact, hard-line policies in general have been largely ineffective in dealing with the Cuban government. The country has not yet abandoned communism, nor has it acquiesced to U.S. demands to address human-rights violations, and Castro only relinquished power to his brother Raúl due to illness, not U.S. pressure. Relentless pursuit of traditional hard-line policies would simply continue to impede the progress of mending U.S.-Cuba relations.
That being said, we would like to see Cuba respond to U.S. overtures with concessions of its own, perhaps addressing crucial issues such as human-rights violations and political prisoners, topics on which Raúl Castro has indicated a willingness to begin a dialogue. If we are truly to embark on a “new beginning,” both sides must take bold steps forward on a new path, one that hopefully leads to a better future than that projected by the hostility of the Cold War days.

The last time the Harvard women’s tennis team took the Ivy League title in 2006, captain Laura Peterzan and fellow senior Beier Ko were enjoying their first spring in Cambridge. Three years later, the team leaders showed their championship experience, going undefeated in singles and doubles to give the Crimson a share of its 18th Ivy crown.
Harvard (13-8, 6-1 Ivy League) dispatched Dartmouth (7-11, 2-5) in convincing fashion with a 6-1 victory yesterday afternoon in the Murr Tennis Center, sealing the contest after only four singles matches. Following a doubles win and easy victories from Ko and Peterzan in the top two singles spots, the Crimson watched as sophomore Agnes Sibilski forced her opponent into an errant forehand, clinching her three set match and the team contest with an emphatic fistpump.
“Clearly we had a goal,” Sibilski said. “We knew that if we won we would be Ivy champs so everyone was really excited.”
No one showed more enthusiasm than Ko, who was the first player to greet Sibilski after her triumph. The squad’s top player recognized the special opportunity to bookend her career with league championships, particularly in her final home match.
“To win the Ivy title on senior day makes [winning the championship] even better,” Ko said. “To end on a win our first and last year, that’s a pretty good feeling.”
Ko and Peterzan certainly contributed their share, posting wins at No. 1 and No. 3 doubles, respectively. Ko teamed with Sibilski and cruised to an 8-2 win, while Peterzan shined in her home finale, slamming a swinging backhand volley crosscourt to finish a 9-0 doubles season with freshman partner Camille Jania and give Harvard the doubles point with an 8-1 win.
“For us, doubles has been very important so far [this season],” Sibilski said. “After pulling that out we had momentum going into singles.”
Indeed the Crimson picked up right where it left off, taking the first set in five of six individual matches.
In the top spot, Ko appeared overwhelmed at first against Big Green standout Molly Scott, dropping serve early for a 0-2 deficit. However, after battling back to a 4-3 lead, Ko found her stride and ran Scott all over the court in a 6-3, 6-1 drubbing.
“I started off a little tired today,” Ko said. “But I realized I needed energy to win the match and I told myself, ‘you have to take it up another level.’ After that it carried through and I won easily.”
Following her classmate’s example, Peterzan dominated Mary Beth Winingham at No. 2, taking the first set 6-2. The two competitors traded five consecutive breaks to keep the match interesting in the second frame, but Peterzan served out at 5-3 to give her squad a 3-0 edge.
Up a set in three of the four remaining matches, the Crimson seemed primed for early victory, but the visitors were not ready to give in. Sibilski, sophomore Samantha Rosenkrans, and freshman Caroline Davis watched early leads melt into tight matches as their opponents gutted out second set wins.
But, with the match in jeopardy and Harvard’s momentum waning, Sibilski set the tone for victory at No. 4 singles by racing out to a 5-0 lead in the third. Despite a last-ditch effort from Dartmouth’s Georgiana Smyser, Sibilski served out the match for a 6-2, 4-6, 6-2 victory to vault the Crimson into a first-place tie with Princeton.
“I’m really proud of our squad for fighting so hard to bring home victory,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “We set out to compete well today and I think we did just that.”
Even with a win in hand, the Crimson who remained on the court closed out their matches with tenacity. Rosenkrans found herself in a back-and-forth struggle at third singles, earning a crucial break at 4-3 to earn some breathing room. The sophomore proceeded to hold easily, securing a 7-5, 3-6, 6-3 decision.
Davis turned in perhaps Harvard’s gutsiest performance at No. 6, showing resilience after dropping the second set 5-7. The rookie suffered an early break, but responded with four straight games to put the match out of reach. With a 6-2, 5-7, 6-3 win, Davis capped a storybook senior day with a dominant showing from all classes, a victory made even sweeter following a February team loss to the Big Green.
“We lost to [Dartmouth] at ECAC’s 4-3,” Ko said. “And now we’ve got our revenge and we won the Ivy Title at the same time. That’s such an amazing feeling.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Powerful forehands and pinpoint backhands; delicate slices and explosive volleys; dropped doubles points and three-set comebacks; the glory of winning and the pain of defeat.
It was just another season for the Harvard men’s tennis team.
Eighty-two days, twelve wins and nine losses on from the beginning of the dual meet season, No. 64 Harvard (13-9, 5-2 Ivy) traveled to Hanover to bring the curtain down on a dramatic regular campaign, against a Dartmouth (4-17, 0-7 Ivy) side rooted to the bottom of the Ivy League.
Faced with a Big Green opponent yet to register a win in the Ancient Eight this year, the Crimson kept its composure to record its fourth triumph in succession with a 6-1 win.
“Everybody played very solid tennis,” head coach David Fish ’72 said. “We were in a league where seven teams were neck and neck, and Dartmouth was just a little down from that [level] … but we’re still glad to get through with a win.”
Despite conceding the doubles point—a recurring theme of its season—Harvard swept the singles en route to a comfortable victory. 
While enough to clinch a joint-second place finish in the Ivy League behind champions-elect Columbia, it was scant consolation for the defeated holders, left to rue what might have been.
“It’s a disappointment, because everyone hoped we could [win the Ivy League],” Fish said. “But you’ve got to be good and lucky in this league—it was really tight.”
With all three seniors included in the doubles lineup for their final game for the Crimson—and Dartmouth buoyed by its shock doubles point against Brown in its previous match—the stage was set for a competitive encounter. 
At No. 1, Harvard got off to an ideal start through the senior-sophomore combination of co-captain Chris Clayton and Alexei Chijoff-Evans, with the duo opening with an 8-2 win.
Crimson enthusiasm would falter as the Big Green staged a comeback. 
At No. 2, Dartmouth’s Curtis Roby and Ari Gayer broke senior Sasha Ermakov and sophomore Aba Omodele-Lucien—the No. 83 pairing in the nation—in an 8-6 win to level the scores. 
The point was sealed by the Big Green’s No.3 partnership; Dan Freeman and Justin Tzou beat junior Michael Hayes and senior co-captain Michael Kalfayan—struggling with an Achilles injury—in a closely-fought result (8-6).
“With all the things that happened this year, losing the doubles point was probably the least surprising thing that could have happened,” Clayton said. “We’ve been losing so many doubles points I can’t even remember.”
Entering the singles, Harvard needed once again to overhaul a point deficit. 
At No. 1, the team was handed an unexpected equalizer in unfortunate circumstances; in Clayton’s first set tiebreaker, the co-captain took a one-point lead before opponent Freeman retired through a hand injury.
Wins further down the courts from Crimson players at opposite ends of their varsity careers brought the match point within touching reach. 
At No. 6, freshman Alistair Felton wrapped up a successful first season with his 20th singles win (6-2, 6-2), while No. 3 Ermakov ended his collegiate experience on a winning note, hitting some trademark return winners in a 6-2, 6-3 victory over Roby.
“They’re a terrific class,” said Fish, referring to his senior singles stalwarts. “With Chris having a shoulder problem and Sasha having had a fracture in his foot, they still played the whole Ivy season and played great.”
Harvard’s all-important fourth point—that match clinching point often elusive in a rollercoaster season—was delivered at the No. 2 position. Chijoff-Evans ground out a 6-4, 6-4 win over the Big Green’s Stephen Greif to ensure an undefeated Ivy League singles season, a 13th consecutive singles win in Ivy play, and the Crimson’s 18th successive win over its Hanover-based rival.
In the remaining fixtures, No. 4 Omodele-Lucien required a second set tiebreaker to finally defeat Tzou (6-2, 7-6 (4)), before No.5 Mangham concluded his campaign with a third set tiebreaker win (6-2, 1-6, (10-6))—ensuring a last hurrah for Harvard.
“It was a slow start,” Clayton said. “[But] it’s nice to see everyone, in our last team match, winning all their singles matches and playing well.”
Despite the loss of the Ivy League championship, Fish sought the positives of a breathtaking campaign for players and fans alike.
“[Clayton] and [Chijoff-Evans] won the regionals, won the regional doubles, we won the ECACs, and Chris will probably go to the Nationals [ECAC Singles],” Fish said. “I think we did essentially everything but the Ivies.”

Tomorrow, April 24th, Armenians around the world will gather on what they call Martyrs’ Day to commemorate the Ottoman Empire’s deportation and mass slaughter of Armenians during World War I.  Armenians and many others deem this the first genocide of the 20th century, citing scholarly consensus that the atrocities were a well-documented and premeditated wartime assault on an ethnic and religious minority.
Not everyone aligns with this view, however—others, namely the current Turkish government, vehemently reject the use of the word “genocide” to describe these events. This puts President Obama in a difficult situation. In years past, the president of the United States has delivered a speech commemorating these events.  Obama will almost certainly keep with this unofficial tradition. But, if he omits the word “genocide,” Armenians around the world will accuse Obama of breaking his promise to explicitly label the events as such. Likewise, if he does utter the “G-word,” a torrent of infuriated accusations will flood in from the many who reject this label. 
Word choice here is certainly very important. To label the acts “genocide” would put the late Ottoman government in the company of Nazis in Germany, Hutus in Rwanda, and other perpetrators of genocide. But no matter how powerful the label of “genocide” may be, insisting on its use should never come before the priority of accurately describing what happened. While a debate over the precise terminology may be useful for international lawyers, for activists and ordinary citizens, studying the actual historical events and their lessons is far more relevant and meaningful than sparring over semantics. For Turkey and Armenia to learn from their experiences in a productive way, both countries should resist the temptation to concentrate too much on this single, albeit extremely powerful, word.
So loaded is the term that it can override logic itself. In an official statement last year, President George W. Bush declared that “as many as 1.5 million Armenians lost their lives in the final years of the Ottoman Empire, many of them victims of mass killings and forced deportations.” Ironically, many Turkish activists celebrated this description for its omission of the word “genocide,” despite its overwhelming castigation of the events in all other ways. Never mind Bush’s accusation that their forebears had executed a campaign of forced deportation and mass murder; as long as the word “genocide” was not mentioned, they believed that they had won.
Similarly, at times Armenian activists have allowed their fixation with the word “genocide” to trump their respect for historical fact. In attempts to convince the world that genocide took place, activists rely at times on inflated death tolls and disputable sources to prove their points. Armenian activists must realize that the accusation of genocide is grave and that using any source or figure that is even remotely disputable is an irresponsible act that only undermines their cause. Carelessly spreading inaccurate information insults both the Turkish and Armenian peoples, slandering the Turkish nation for crimes it did not commit as well as casting doubt on the true accounts of Armenian survivors.
Those of us recognizing Martyrs’ Day tomorrow, then, should not fall into the trap of arguing over whether the events of 1915 should be classified as “genocide.” Instead, we should find people who were there or were affected and speak with these living primary and secondary sources. It shouldn’t be too difficult to find someone—cities all over the world, from Boston to L.A., Montreal to Fresno, Moscow to Sao Paulo, and Paris to Beirut, host thriving Armenian communities made up of scattered survivors and their descendants, all of whom have a story to tell. And, when we do talk to them, instead of asking, “Was it a genocide?”, we should simply ask, “What happened?” That way, instead of feeling the pressure to shape such devastating experiences to a label, we can let the content of history speak for itself.

Environmentalists, rejoice! Last week,  the Environmental Protection Agency finalized a report classifying carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as pollutants, which, thanks to a 2007 Supreme Court ruling, gives them the authority to begin regulating carbon emissions. And just in time to celebrate Earth Day. 
To be sure, everyone involved would be better off if Congress could instead muster the political will to pass a climate and energy bill now (rather than in a year), for no one stands to benefit concretely from EPA regulation. Industry groups, Republicans, and coal-state Democrats would much rather have regulation of carbon emissions come as the result of congressional legislation, a process over which they can exert some influence. Environmentalists would also prefer to have federal legislation that puts in place permanent rules governing the emission of carbon rather than leaving that decision up to whoever is in the White House. (It so happens that the current occupant is sympathetic to the position that we should limit emissions, but, as evidenced by the two previous administrations, this won’t always be the case.) And, in any event, the likely outcome of an actual EPA attempt to regulate emissions would be years of contentious litigation that get us nowhere. Environmentalists, rejoice?
Yet, while the specter of EPA regulation of greenhouse gases may not be the solution to global warming, it nevertheless constitutes an important victory for the White House. Until the interests can be aligned to pass a climate bill (and there is good reason to believe that won’t happen until 2010), the White House can use EPA regulation as an implicit threat: If Congress can’t get its own act together, the EPA will simply move forward on regulating emissions. It also buys time to build popular support and a political coalition to pass the imperfect but commendable draft bill presented by Congressmen Ed Markey and Henry Waxman as well as to pick up the always elusive 60 votes in the Senate. 
President Barack Obama and his administration have thus far been hands-off because they recognize that climate change doesn’t have a lot of traction in the midst of an economic downturn. Following the election, it ranked last in a survey of the American people’s top 20 policy priorities. The EPA stick that the White House now proposes to wield allows it to both distance itself from the political fallout from the legislative process while maintaining the impetus on climate change and pressure for an eventual legislative resolution. 
How did the leader of the opposition respond to all this?  Speaking Sunday morning on This Week with George Stephanopoulos, House Minority Leader John Boehner (R-Ohio) had this to say about carbon emissions: “The idea that carbon dioxide is a carcinogen that is harmful to our environment is almost comical. Every time we exhale, we exhale carbon dioxide. Every cow in the world, you know, when they do what they do, you’ve got more carbon dioxide.” 
What’s more than “almost comical” is Boehner’s conflation of pollutants and carcinogens. Even allowing for the distortion-in-the-service-of-simplification that comes naturally to politicians who spend too much time appearing on Fox News, excuse me for being mildly shocked that such an ignorant comment could encapsulate the views of one of the two major political parties in the greatest country in the world. Clearly, the purpose was misleading the more than 50 percent  of Americans who aren’t sure if global warming is a manmade phenomenon. 
Having the EPA regulate carbon emissions is certainly not a long-term solution, yet it comes at a critical time, not just in American politics, but in the international effort for a climate accord. The international community is looking toward climate negotiations in Copenhagen this December, where it aspires to a climate accord to go into effect in 2012. If cabinet-level appointments and rhetoric are any indication, the current administration at least has a clear conception of what the problem is (which can’t be said of its predecessor). The rest of the world is, once again, prepared to follow America’s lead. Even China, whose official stance for years has been that the carbon in the atmosphere wreaking havoc today was emitted by the major powers during the Industrial Revolution, thus absolving itself of any responsibility to curb emissions, appears ready to relent somewhat. Although they remain unwilling to cut e=missions at the expense of economic growth, a growing number of top-level Chinese bureaucrats are coming to the realization that, at the very least, they could adopt targets that would peg emissions to economic growth.
After the major shortcomings of Kyoto, it would be extremely discouraging for nothing to materialize in Copenhagen. Nothing is more likely to bring such a result than the perception that the United States still cannot muster the political will to begin to seriously address climate change.  Republicans and coal-state Democrats appear determined, not unjustifiably, to block domestic legislation until after Copenhagen out of fear that American business will be disadvantaged vis-a-vis foreign competitors. Hopefully, the threat of EPA regulation, and the political pressure for serious legislation that it engenders, will weigh seriously in the international balance leading up to Copenhagen.

To the editors:
Brian Bolduc’s opinion essay, “The Boredomization of Politics,” paints an all-too-simple picture of an academic discipline that is much more complicated. On the credit side of the ledger, Bolduc is right that some of the more technical developments in political science have come at the expense of accessibility and even insight. What is not true is that we have to choose between quantitative and non-quantitative approaches to politics. Bolduc’s essay establishes a false binary—“These professors ditched The Federalist Papers for Excel spreadsheets years ago.” In this crude thinking, no course could (or should) have both. 
Yet politics is full of things countable and not. We can indeed learn about some of the most interesting things in politics —votes, campaign contributions, election returns, government spending—by quantifying them. If, like tens of thousands of other readers, you followed Nate Silver’s electoral projections at www.538.com this past fall, you were reading the fruits of modern political science, which has made important contributions to survey research and applied statistics. 
And, of course, many critical features of politics are distorted when they are quantified. Albert Einstein was apparently fond of a remark that “Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.”  (There is a deeper mathematical insight here that underlies much of modern statistics and decision theory; for an introduction, see Patrick Billingsley, Convergence of Probability Measures.) And so hundreds of political science courses at Harvard and elsewhere continue to offer readings in political philosophy, American political development and political history, and legal and administrative decisions. 
The real failure of Bolduc’s essay is its intellectual laziness. Had he consulted a wide range of courses at Harvard alone, he would have found the intellectual content he was looking for.  To take one among many of the possibilities, he might have considered my course, “The Theory and Practice of Republican Government,” where dozens of the Federalist Papers are read and studied intensively. In “Bureaucratic Politics: Military, Government, Economic and Social Organizations,” a sampling of decision theory, non-parametric statistics and stochastic modeling is combined with a healthy reading of Alfred Chandler’s The Visible Hand, the history of the U.S. Army, and Mary Douglas’s How Institutions Think. There are many other courses at Harvard that combine narrative, philosophical, and quantitative methods, and this combination represents one of the real strengths of modern political science education.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the editors:
As a full-time activist, a student of public policy, and a woman who sometimes removes her clothes for a cause, I feel obliged to respond to Courtney Fiske’s April 13th column (“Veganism as Sexism,” column, April 13).
As an organization staffed largely by feminist women, PETA would not do something that we felt contributed to the very serious problems that women face. PETA’s “naked” demonstrators and models choose to participate in these actions because they want to do something to make people stop and pay attention. We believe that people (including men, as shown in the link that Ms. Fiske provided to our “I’d Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur” campaign) should have the choice to use their own bodies to make social statements and that there is nothing shameful or “wrong” about being naked. This tactic has been used since Lady Godiva rode naked on a horse to protest taxes on the poor in the 11th century. 
Readers might find it interesting to consider that it is the societies that allow women to wear revealing clothing that are the ones in which women have the most rights and the most power. Likewise, it is the societies that punish women for wearing revealing clothing in which women have the fewest rights and the least power. Should women only be allowed to participate in activism if they promise not to show their bodies or use their bodies as political statements? If people choose to use their bodies and sexuality to convey a message, aren’t those of us who censor them—even if our motives are good—also somewhat guilty of disrespect and repression?

To the editors:
In the recent article written about me in The Crimson (“The Politics of Condoms,” column, April 16), the impression was given that the Harvard Center for Population and Development Studies decided to end the AIDS Prevention Research Project, of which I am director, in response to my recent, controversial comments which questioned condoms as the panacea for AIDS in Africa. That is not the case. Our project is not being continued, but it has been extended beyond its original end-date on a no-cost extension basis.
Also, I should point out that the statement, “Increased availability of condoms has not led to a substantial increase in their use, as such devices carry the social stigma of a lack of trust,” should refer to consistent usage, not to all condom usage. This is an important point—condom use in fact has increased substantially in many places, but unfortunately this has not translated into consistent usage, which remains quite low, or into lower HIV infection rates in Africa’s population-wide epidemics.

Harvard students are promoting environmental awareness and celebrating the University’s current green initiatives by hosting a week of events commemorating Earth Day, culminating in a celebration in the Mac Quad on Saturday.Rebecca J. Howe ’11, the Harvard Environmental Action Committee’s Earth Day Co-Chair, said that the festivities are completely student-run and that numerous Harvard organizations such as the Outing Club, Geological Society, the Vegetarian Society, Green Labs, and Sustainable Allston are also sponsoring the events. Even the Harvard University Dining Services contributed to the Earth Day celebration—all of the dining halls served specially-prepared dinners commemorating Earth Day, with meals composed of “green” ingredients. “They made a cranberry walnut salad that was absolutely delicious,” Jakub Dolecki ’11 said, noting that they did not serve beef and listed the ingredients for each dish on special tags.Dolecki said he appreciated the tags because they showed that HUDS “took care in acquiring green ingredients.”The students involved said they are especially excited for the culminating event on Saturday, which will feature Boloco burritos and performances by Harvard and Berklee bands, along with student activities. Dolecki said he was planning on attending the event and was excited for the free food.  The EAC launched its bike-sharing program on Earth Day yesterday, and hopes to attract students to sign up for the program at the event on Saturday, where bikes will be available for testing. Howe, the EAC Earth-Day co-chair, said she hopes the timing of the event—which will occur during the College’s weekend for prospective freshman—will allow them to reach out to even more students.“We are trying to show prefrosh that you can help out the environment,” she said.Howe also added that “a big focus of the event” will be to highlight some of Harvard’s efforts to promote sustainability—in July 2008, University President Drew G. Faust committed Harvard to reducing greenhouse gas emissions 30 percent below 2006 levels by 2016.Harvard has also recently put up wind turbines on the roof of the Holyoke Center and solar panels on some University-owned buildings.Throughout Earth Week, which began on Monday, various organizations within Harvard are sponsoring activities to promote environmental issues such as documentary showings and speaker events

He says he was told it was simply a difference in investment policy.But to Steven M. Rose, then a tax director for Harvard Management Company, the deceptive financial reporting and pervasive ethical deficiencies he says he witnessed there were far from benign. And while the University commissioned an investigation into the issues he raised, he says he quickly reached the point where he felt his concerns had been brushed aside.“The general disregard for the rules, procedures and compliance—it was ridiculous,” Rose said in an interview with The Crimson. “You had to be quiet and do it and put blinders on. If you were doing work in other aspects of the company, you could just do your job. But in [my] part of the job, you couldn’t ignore things.”Harvard Management Company—which oversees Harvard’s multi-billion dollar endowment—was plagued by a culture of ethical laxity, Rose said. Special relationships with funds run by former employees and the use of offshore investment companies—both used to boost HMC’s once-legendary returns—may not be illegal, but are considered to be ethically questionable by some, particularly in light of Harvard’s non-profit status.“Some people think that even if you’re [using offshore companies] legally, there’s something...unethical about it,” said Benjamin Leff, a visiting professor at Harvard Law School who specializes in taxes and regulation of non-profit organizations. “Would there be totally legal and proper things that an investment company with a Cayman subsidiary would be doing? There could be. Could there be illegal [things]? Definitely. Are there some things in between? Yes.”In Sept. 2001, Rose resigned after deciding he could no longer subordinate his judgment to others at the company, and he sent a four-page memo to then-University President Lawrence H. Summers outlining his concerns, causing the University to hire an external legal counsel to investigate. But whether the move led to substantive changes in Harvard’s investment policies remains unclear.According to tax filings for the year ending in 2007, the most recent one available, Harvard maintains investments in various foreign entities—including several that had been listed in previous filings as Cayman Islands companies. Harvard has ceased to list the specific locations of its related companies in the most recent tax filings.When asked about these companies’ current locations, University spokesman John D. Longbrake declined to comment. He also would not elaborate on whether Harvard continues to have special reduced-fee arrangements with external investment managers, writing only in an e-mailed statement that Rose’s complaints were “the subject of a thorough review by an external expert” that ultimately concluded they were “without merit.”But Rose was not alone in voicing such concerns. A 2004 New York Times article raised questions about HMC’s advantageous relationships with firms run by former employees, and quoted then-Chief Executive Jack R. Meyer as saying the special agreements had yielded $125 million in savings for the University up to that point.After his resignation, Rose said his concerns only deepened, fueled in part by Enron’s high-profile implosion due to unethical accounting practices—including the liberal use of offshore accounts. He says he noticed disturbing similarities in Enron’s and HMC’s investment strategies, which prompted him to file a disclosure in early 2002 detailing his concerns with the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Senate Finance Committee.All the documents and correspondence in this article were provided by Rose, and many of the entities and people mentioned declined to discuss the exchanges, citing policies not to comment on their relationships with clients. The Finance Committee took notice, according to Dean A. Zerbe, then-senior counsel on the Committee for Senator Charles E. “Chuck” Grassley. Rose said he discussed possible legislative action to curb abuses by public charities with Zerbe after the Committee received the disclosure. Zerbe said in an interview that Rose was “certainly knowledgeable” about his area of work and that his early input to the Committee was of “extraordinary value” in shaping the ongoing review of rules governing university endowments.But though recent changes could bring more transparency to non-profits, Rose questions whether new disclosure requirements will be enough to curb the widespread unethical practices he says he saw at HMC.“The switch was on for all sorts of indiscretions,” Rose said. “I’ve never been that close to unabashed, raw greed in my life, up to and since then.”‘NO TAX AUTHORITY’Before joining HMC, Rose lectured in taxation at Northeastern University and worked as a tax manager for what is now PricewaterhouseCoopers.While Rose only served as a tax director for a year at HMC before resigning, he previously helped prepare the company’s taxes for ten years as an independent contractor. Although he had never noticed any suspect activity at HMC before—he said he was simply given data from which to produce returns—his new position’s oversight and personnel access provided him with information that gradually coalesced into broader—and more disturbing—insights into the company’s complex network of operations.According to Rose, HMC frequently under-reported its income from outside money management firms by “netting” it, or cancelling it out, with management fees paid out by the University. This practice, which reduces HMC tax obligations, is questionable because much of the income that Harvard receives from the firms actually derives from management fees that the firms collect from other investors—activities unrelated to the University’s tax-exempt purpose. Daniel Halperin, an HLS professor who specializes in tax policy and non-profit organizations, said that an evaluation of the proper tax treatment for the income would also depend on whether Harvard’s share of the management fees is collected from regularly conducted trade or business, and the reasons why Harvard is making special arrangements with the money managers. He added that resolving these issues conclusively is difficult without access to more detailed information.Rose said that when he raised concerns to HMC lawyers about netting, they said they had “no tax authority,” or legal precedent, to be engaging in the practice—but continued nonetheless.Leff, the visiting HLS professor, said that while he did not have enough understanding of Rose’s specific concerns to make an informed judgment, “a lawyer asked by an auditor about the legal authority for the treatment of a transaction should be able to give at least the legal reasoning under which the treatment is proper.”In the 2004 Times article, former HMC CEO Meyer—who later left the company with 30 employees and a $500 million initial investment from the University to start his own hedge fund—said none of the relationships were deceptive and that he had an “outside legal opinion [on netting], which he declined to share.” But the story cited two former high-ranking IRS officials who disputed Meyer’s interpretation of netting, as well as concerns from accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers that caused one firm to report their fees in full instead.PricewaterhouseCoopers declined to comment for this story, citing their policy not to discuss individual clients, and Meyer, through an assistant, also declined to comment.‘TAX-ADVERSE’A further point of contention was HMC’s use of complex “structured finance agreements,” which created and linked so many investment entities that tax reporting became nearly impossible to conduct without attending planning discussions among the managers and HMC lawyers, Rose said.And many of the entities that Harvard owned and invested in, both for- and non-profit, were directed and staffed by former University employees who continued to receive millions of dollars in management fees from Harvard, presenting what he saw as a conflict of interest.In one particularly infuriating incident, Rose said that after he repeatedly inquired about a seemingly purposeless investment vehicle, a lawyer informed him that the company was actually set up to help a former employee defer his income to a Cayman Islands entity—thereby avoiding substantial tax payments. He also mentions another instance in his disclosure in which HMC officials adamantly opposed the reporting of a foreign entity—likely because the form used would have been attached to the publicly visible IRS Form 990, exposing Harvard to questioning about its use of offshore accounts.Offshore tax havens can help organizations avoid federal taxes of up to 39 percent, according to a 2007 story in the Chronicle of Higher Education. A 2008 Senate report estimated that the United States loses up to $100 billion a year in tax revenue to offshore havens.Eventually, Rose said that the culture of silence and the “creativity” that managers encouraged among employees to circumvent tax payments became so disruptive that he could no longer properly conduct his work. The culture of HMC, Rose said, was such that managers consciously avoided providing him with necessary reporting information. He recalls one incident in particular in which a lawyer told him he was “rocking the boat” after he raised a legitimate tax issue.“They were really tax-adverse, and they did anything possible to reduce taxes,” Rose said, pointing to the individual greed of HMC’s executives. “I had to deal with the money managers’ mindset [that] if Harvard somehow has to pay a tax, that would reduce their take-home pay as well.”‘THE ROAD TO HELL’In an Oct. 2001 letter responding to Rose’s concerns, Summers wrote that he took the issues “very seriously” and that Harvard was hiring an independent counsel to ensure that Harvard maintained “the highest level of legal and ethical compliance.”Jerome Kurtz, the independent attorney retained by Harvard to investigate the HMC practices and a former Internal Revenue Service commissioner, said he does not recall Rose or his concerns, though “that doesn’t mean it didn’t happen.” He added that he only remembers being hired to examine compensation arrangements with some of the investment managers, though he verified that  signatures on correspondence with Rose regarding the concerns were indeed his. Shortly after his resignation, Rose said he became increasingly concerned that Harvard may have had ethically questionable ties to Enron, which went bankrupt in late 2001. Herbert S. Winokur ’65 served both on the secretive Harvard Corporation and on Enron’s board of directors, a dual commitment that Rose said he found disconcerting. He also found ethically troubling Harvard’s 49 percent ownership interest in former Enron affiliate Cook Inlet Energy Supply—which he said made substantial profits from the debilitating California energy crisis of 2000 and 2001.In a phone interview, Winokur said that legal investigations have since concluded that Harvard had no improper relationship with Enron.But despite the University’s internal investigation, Rose said he feared his ethics concerns were not being taken seriously by the administration. So he decided to go to the federal government, where he found sympathetic listeners.“The road to hell is paved with bricks that are stamped with ‘it’s legal,’” said Zerbe, Senator Grassley’s chief counsel. “But particularly for a leading charity like Harvard, I think there’s an expectation of better behavior than just ‘it’s legal,’ as opposed to ‘it’s best practice.’”Now, seven years later, changes in non-profit tax reporting have finally been made—and many of the revisions reflect Rose’s concerns.For the tax year ending 2009, the IRS is phasing in the use of a new Form 990, which is filed by non-profit organizations. As the first major revision in 30 years, the report will include more detailed questioning of company governance and policies, compensation, foreign activities, and organizational structuring. And since previous filings asked organizations to report some information in unstructured attachments—which often led to incomplete or missing information—the new revision increases the number of additional reporting forms from two to 16.In recent years, Harvard has included increasing amounts of disclosures on its tax forms. And in 2006, then-HMC chief Mohamed A. El-Erian hired a “chief compliance officer,” echoing a suggestion Rose made in a letter to Kurtz four years earlier. El-Erian, who succeeded Meyer and pledged to “rebuild and reinvent” the company, said at the time that the move was not prompted by regulatory requirements, but merely a desire to stay “at the forefront of the industry.”Rose says he hopes that the improved Form 990 will “open the blinds” on Harvard’s practices, though he says he wishes the changes had come earlier.“I don’t know what I could have done differently, and I keep thinking about it,” Rose said. “Lots of people that work for Harvard enjoy working there, and I would have liked to have that. But it was not possible for me given the environment.”—Staff writer Peter F. Zhu can be reached at pzhu@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At a time when university endowments are plummeting by as much as 30 percent, Harvard and its peer institutions have reaffirmed their commitment to meet student financial need as a “top priority”—often at the expense of faculty hires and campus renovations—to stay ahead of the pack in attracting candidates.Over the past few months, university presidents have pledged in succession to up spending on financial aid, anticipating greater need from both current and prospective students.Harvard College plans to increase the amount of financial aid dollars for next year by 18 percent—a figure exceeding even the Financial Aid Office’s earlier expectations. Other institutions including Princeton, Dartmouth, and Cornell will also see double-digit percentage increases in the amount of aid distributed.The increased support for financial aid programs at the various universities will be funded partially by modest tuition hikes hovering around the 3 percent mark, as most administrators are hesitant to further burden families from across the socioeconomic spectrum who feel the recession’s pinch.But with a near-zero inflation rate, any upticks in tuition, unlike in previous years, will mean an increase in real dollars.Because a significant chunk of funding for financial aid initiatives comes from university endowments—all of which have been crippled by volatile markets in past months—university leaders have been forced to scale back on other endeavors funded by endowment money.University President Drew G. Faust has slowed Allston construction plans, for example, and staff layoffs—which have already begun elsewhere—have been discussed by administrators at Harvard as well.The 18 percent increase in the financial aid budget translates to a total of $145 million to be awarded next year, roughly 70 percent of which will likely be drawn from the endowment.“This has been an outreach priority for us for a number of years,” said the College’s Financial Aid Office Director Sally C. Donahue. “It certainly has not diminished.”Some universities—such as Tufts, which suspended its need-blind admissionspolicy this year—are not in a position to pledge the same level of financialsupport at this time, meaning that Harvard and wealthier institutions findthemselves ahead of the pack in the race to pluck the strongest students from all backgrounds.“Yale’s financial aid program is among the most generous in the U.S.,” said Caesar T. Storlazzi, the university’s Director of Financial Aid. “Yale will remain extremely competitive and continue to attract prospective students.”Yale, which boasts a financial aid initiative for undergraduates similar to Harvard’s, will increase its financial aid spending by 5 percent next year.Though maintaining financial aid programs comes at a cost, university leaders say they recognize the importance of reaching out to previously underrepresented demographics—cultivating, in the process, a reputation for providing a topnotch but accessible education.“We spend a lot of time trying to make sure we get the word out,” Donahue said of the College’s financial aid initiative launched in 2007.—Staff writer Athena Y.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Secretary of Homeland Security
Tom J. Ridge discussed his role in the
Hurricane Katrina crisis, terrorism, and
his own political aspirations in an interview
yesterday with
The Harvard Crimson.
He played an integral
role in post-9/11
governance when he
was asked by President
George W. Bush
to leave his office as
Governor of Pennsylvania
to take the role
of the first Assistant to
the President for Homeland Security.
He later would become Secretary of
Homeland Security, and would oversee
the creation of the Department of
Homeland Security.
Currently, Ridge is serving as a visiting
fellow at the Harvard Institute of
Politics.
The Harvard Crimson: The establishment
of the Office of Homeland Security
constituted the largest government
reorganization in half a century. What
did it feel like to take on such a large role
in homeland security after 9/11?
Tom Ridge: I felt bad about leaving
a job that I loved immensely. I’m very
proud and privileged to have served as
governor. But in a post-9/11 environment,
every American was asking ‘What
can I do?’ and the President gave me an
opportunity to make a contribution and
hopefully most people will conclude that
I did.
THC: When you left the Department,
did you foresee the possibility of government mishandling an event like Katrina?
TR: Not only did we foresee the possibility,
we anticipated it. One of my great
disappointments with the government’s
response to Katrina was that the procedures
and plans that we had developed in
anticipation of something as cataclysmic
as Katrina were not applied in a timely
or effective way. No
one could have prevented
the levees
from breaking, but
I think much of the
problem with the
Katrina disaster was
the failure of political
and government
leadership at the
local, mayor, state,
and federal level.
THC: Would
you take any personal
responsibility
for what occurred after Katrina?
TR: I think it was more of a leadership
challenge, and for that I take absolutely
no responsibility. My huge disappointment
is that it’s not as if my team
and others who were still in the department
had not anticipated there might be
a time when the state and local resources
are overwhelmed by a catastrophic event.
I regret, frankly that I wasn’t in charge
because I think we would have done
things differently.
Procedures and
protocols are not
sexy stuff, but
there are certain
operational structures
that we built
to handle precisely
that kind of event
that were either
ignored or deployed
later than it
should have been.
THC: Do you
foresee the possibility
of ever running for the United
States Senate?
TR: No.
THC: Do you have any further political
aspirations?
TR: I would like to help the Republican
Party find its voice. People are worried
about our messengers, but before
we have a messenger we better figure out
what our message is. I would [also] like
to work with men and women on both sides of the aisle who bring a respect and
civility to political discourse that I think
we’ve abandoned. There are so many issues
out there that are controversial and
neither party has been willing to invest
the political capital to solve them. I’d like
to see us try to do it in a bipartisan way.
THC: Former VP Dick Cheney has
said that Obama will “raise the risk to the
American people of another attack.” Do
you agree with this?
TR: I’m not going to respond specifically
to Cheney because I think the
White House has done that. The one caveat
I would say with regard to how the
administration has begun to handle this
is that to call terrorist attacks ‘manmade
disasters’ doesn’t make sense.
What I’m concerned about is that
the characterization of our effort against
these extremists has rhetorically been
minimized. I haven’t seen anything
that President Obama has done yet that
makes me fearful that we will be less than
vigorous in our approach to dealing with
these extremists. I just think the language
is so politically correct – we ought to call
it what it is.
THC: President Obama has been
proposing some form of amnesty plan
for illegal immigrants. Given your background,
do you believe this is a correct
plan for immigration policy?
TR: I said a long time ago that the reality
of identifying and returning to their
country of origin the X million of illegals
who are here is a fantasy. We need to
face up to the reality that Congress and
Presidents since the mid-80s have failed
to deal with the issue. Now is an opportunity
to forge a bipartisan solution. We
need to find some way to legalize their
presence; not [by] granting them citizenship-we may put them at the end of the
line-but not [by] sending them all back.

At an event publicizing his new cookbook at Harvard Bookstore, Chef Peter Davis urged consumers to “Buy Local!” Davis, the chef of Henrietta’s Table, a restaurant at the Charles Hotel, was promoting “Fresh and Honest: Food from the Farms of New England and the Kitchen of Henrietta’s Table.”Davis penned the book to promote local farmers and products. He spoke ruefully about the difficulties small farmers face when competing with more profitable mass-market farms. But he said that he was hopeful that small farms are making a comeback as the average American starts to “care more about where their food comes from.” For example, he mentioned that there are more farms in Massachusetts now than there were five years ago, and these farms are also smaller, both signs that independent, local farmers are on the rise. Davis took many questions from the audience about the best places to buy local produce.He said that New England’s best produce specialties include fiddlehead ferns, wild ramps, apples, cranberries, and nettles. His enthusiasm about food history was evident as he described how Concord, MA used to be the “asparagus capital of the country” in the late 1800’s.The event organizer, Heather Gain, said she thought the event was “fantastic,” adding that Harvard Bookstore loved working with and promoting fellow local independent businesses. She was very happy with the turnout of over 50 people, and noted that food writing and cookbooks are a growing part of the bookstore’s business.The event was made more appealing by the offerings of local cheeses, fruits, and wines selected by Davis. Some attendees, such as Naveen N. Sinha, a graduate student, said that they enjoyed the event—and that the food was an especially welcome addition. As a student in microbial sciences, he said that he appreciated the “nice overlap” between his culinary interests and research interests. He mentioned that he likes to buy locally-produced goods, but also that he understood that many Americans might not be able to afford such a luxury.Most of the audience seemed enthused about local food afterwards, swapping stories and recipes and sharing their favorite farmer’s market locations and times. As Davis noted, there has been a “huge increase” in the number of Massachusetts farmers markets in the last few years. “There are three in Harvard Square alone!” he exclaimed.

To accommodate the disparity in academic focus between the human evolutionary biology concentration within anthropology and the rest of the department, the Faculty Council—the 18-member governing body of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—passed a proposal yesterday to make human evolutionary biology a separate department.Under the plan, the anthropology department—which currently offers concentrations in human evolutionary biology and anthropology, with three separate tracks—would divide into two separate departments. The human evolutionary biology concentration offered by the anthropology department is essentially a life science with some elements of the social sciences—making it profoundly different from the archaeology and social anthropology tracks within the anthropology concentration, according to anthropology professor Daniel E. Lieberman ’86.“What we do, the questions we ask, the techniques we use, the issues we ponder...are so divergent from those of our colleagues in anthropology,” said Lieberman, a professor in the biological anthropology division. “It no longer makes any sense to be in the same department...It’s come to a point where we don’t really share much in common with our colleagues.”The administrative complexity and the differences in academic interest has made the formation of the human evolutionary biology department the “logical conclusion” to about five years of discussion—but not much is changing, Lieberman said.“The administrative structure is the thing that’s changing,” he said, emphasizing that the formation of the department will not cause any changes in concentration requirements. Sweeping changes would be difficult in the current financial climate, anyway, he said.With the requisite student interest, the biological anthropology track within the anthropology concentration will still be offered, Lieberman said.The proposal still awaits the vote of the full Faculty in May for official recognition of the new department in July.If approved, the department in human evolutionary biology will continue its study of the evolutionary development of humans to address problems such as obesity and diabetes by focusing on areas like behavioral biology, genetics, and physiology.—Staff writer Esther I.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Upper-level FAS administrators have deferred a push from professors seeking to create a great books program within General Education, citing a lack of resources due to the financial crisis.
Dean of Undergraduate Education and Gen Ed committee chair Jay M. Harris—who petitioned his superiors for the funds to make such a program possible—recently e-mailed the ad hoc committee members to inform them that the plan is on hold due to a lack of funds, though he and the Gen Ed committee remain committed to the project, according to history professor David R. Armitage, who co-chaired the ad hoc faculty committee that had been exploring the possibility of a great books track within Gen Ed.
When the great books committee first formed last fall, the expectation was that the program would start soon, according to David Damrosch, a visiting professor from Columbia who has been involved in the committee’s discussions and will be taking over as chair of the comparative literature department next year.
Armitage said that the committee was just starting to gain momentum when Harris relayed the administration’s verdict, dealing what Armitage suggested may be a blow to the efficacy of the Gen Ed program as a whole. 
“If General Education does not have a fundamental program like the one that we are beginning to consider, we will be failing Harvard’s undergraduates by not providing them with a basic opportunity for their education,” he said.
Armitage added that as a result of the decision, the great books committee will no longer be convened because he does not want to waste the members’ time discussing a program that may not come to fruition.
A ‘SPONTANEOUS’ MOVEMENT 
The recent movement for a Harvard great books program started at a “spontaneous” gathering of about a dozen professors from a variety of disciplines at the Faculty Club in fall 2007, according to Armitage. There was a sense of excitement at that first meeting, he said, since all the professors there expressed commitment to teaching in a program dedicated to foundational texts.
From there, an ad hoc committee to explore the possibility of building a great books program—co-chaired by Armitage and English professor Marjorie Garber—formed this year under the purview of the Gen Ed committee.
But after meeting a few times last semester, the committee found itself waiting for Harris to verify whether funds would be available for a potential program to proceed in the current economic climate.
The verdict ended up being no.
Although Harris declined to comment for this article, the professors involved said that he strongly backed the plan and attempted to convince his superiors to fund it.
Such support seems consistent with Harris’ resume, which includes a bachelor’s and Ph.D. degree from Columbia—one of the few remaining universities that can lay claim to a required great books curriculum. In the late 1980s, Harris even taught in the university’s Core program, which emphasizes a grounding in canonical texts. Damrosch and Armitage—also Columbia expatriates—once taught in the same curriculum.
A FOUNDATIONAL CURRICULUM
Even supporters of a great books program said they believed that student enthusiasm was not widespread enough to warrant making such a curriculum a requirement. Many professors interviewed for this article said that it is simply not in Harvard’s DNA to require students to take specific courses. The College, they said, has always opted for more choice in undergraduates’ courses of study.
But the program’s many proponents offered a variety of reasons, both practical and intellectual, for why a great books curriculum would at least be useful on an optional basis. 
Yiddish literature professor Ruth R. Wisse said that it would be intellectually fulfilling to confront the greatest works that have shaped Western civilization, and that the canon reinforces the idea of a common culture in which everyone has a part. Committee members appear to have had even wider ambitions—proposing plans to integrate world literature into any great books program from the start, according to Damrosch.
Others said that they felt that what Armitage called “a radical move for students to deploy their intellectual armory” might in fact be a very sensible move to complement the College’s soon-to-be-launched Gen Ed curriculum.
English professor Louis Menand—one of the architects of the Gen Ed program—said that he would love to see great books courses being taught in the new curriculum since they “would look new” amidst a Gen Ed slate heavily populated with curricular holdovers. 
Philosophy professor Sean D. Kelly, who was on the great books committee, also stressed the great books’ compatibility with Gen Ed’s emphasis on subject matter rather than methods of knowing. 
But some professors are warier about the idea of a great books program within Gen Ed.
“We have a Gen Ed program,” said history professor Charles S. Maier ’60. “I think to run two programs sets up an unhealthy—it just sets up the idea that we don’t know what to provide students.”
TOO COSTLY?
Precise ideas of the form that the great books program would have taken were never solidified, members of the great books committee said, and concerns about funding and personnel only complicated discussions.   
When Harris relayed news of the delay, the committee had not finalized the preferred format, let alone written a proposal, Armitage said. The only thing that was decided, he said, was that the great books courses would count toward some of the Gen Ed categories—perhaps two, possibly four of them.
Though planning had not progressed to particularly detailed stages when news of funding problems became official, committee members acknowledged that models under consideration emphasized small seminar-style discussions. 
But even that would have posed complications. Professors said that it would be costly to teach individual seminars to a capped number of students in a full-fledged great books program—especially since Harvard has slowed down hiring, and any Gen Ed class would take professors’ time away from teaching department classes.
“There are so many things already sucking away faculty time from teaching in their home departments,” said history lecturer Adam G. Beaver, who is also the department’s assistant director of undergraduate studies and said that he would strongly favor the creation of a great books program. “Great books would be another thing.”
Some professors say that it would be key for professors—not postdocs and graduate students—to be the ones who would teach such courses.
“In our department, we are careful about who teaches in the sub-fields, and I think great books deserves no less than that,” said government professor Dennis F. Thompson, who added that he would not want to see “amateur teaching,” which would “degrade” the enterprise. 
But according to Armitage, the committee had not eliminated the idea of including graduate students and postdocs in a teaching capacity—especially since it is a common concern that there might not be enough professors to accommodate student demand. Other proposals to alleviate the personnel shortage included making great books seminars application-only to control the size of the program.    
But for now, Harvard will not be implementing the program in any form—indeed, next year it will also lose one of the only courses at the College that explicitly advertises itself as a great books class.
COURSE: REJECTED
Armenian Studies Professor James R. Russell first submitted a Gen Ed course proposal for his Freshman Seminar 39k: “Literature Humanities: The Foundation Texts of the West,” in November, only to find out this month that the course, founded on a rigorous sequence of canonical texts, had been rejected.
The cited reason, Russell said, was that there was no coherent theme linking the course texts together—a complaint that he said he found unconvincing.
“I don’t even think that was a serious reason,” he said of the Gen Ed committee’s justification for rejecting the proposal. “It sounded like double-talk. And you know what? Fine.”
Russell said in a phone interview from Israel, where is now on sabbatical, that he is now no longer planning on teaching the course as a freshman seminar—nor is he planning to teach any Gen Ed classes, House seminars, or freshman seminars. From now on, he said, he will simply teach Armenian studies.
The Gen Ed committee rejected the course because they did not believe it belonged in the new curriculum, according to Philosophy professor Edward J. Hall, who serves on both the Gen Ed committee and the subcommittee that reviews course proposals in the humanities.
“The content of the proposal was not presented in a way which made it anywhere near clear enough how this fit into the guiding idea behind General Education,” he said.
When the Gen Ed committee rejects course proposals, Hall added, it is not to say that it is a bad class. He said that Russell’s course looked like “a fantastic course of a certain kind”—but not a Gen Ed course.
Present and former students in Russell’s freshman seminar expressed disappointment at the course’s rejection.
“I find it deeply unfair in all respects not only to Prof. Russell, but also to his students—to all of us,” said David Zuluaga ’12, who took the first half of the freshman seminar before Russell left for Israel. 
Abigail R. Fradkin ’09, who took Russell’s freshman seminar the first time that it was offered, said that the great books contain an element that speaks to human beings at a fundamental, arguably even universal level.
She added that although students who come to Harvard seeking to do highly specialized work should have that opportunity, students who want a broader educational experience should not be ignored.
But not all students at Harvard are in favor of the great books.
“I don’t think Harvard has a huge need for that sort of course right now,” said Classics concentrator Paul T. Mumma ’09. “If you want to find coursework on the great books, you can find that—it’s just up to the individual to find it.”
Christopher Catizone ’06, who is currently a Harvard Law School student and tutor in Dunster House, said that a great books program would provide Harvard with an enriching unifying experience. He wrote an essay for the student essay collection on Gen Ed that was published in 2005, which made a rare case for the great books during the curricular review.
Catizone said that after students come to college from the “narrow societies” where they’ve grown up—whether in Manhattan or Nebraska—it is the beauty of a college education to give students’ the opportunity to cast off their past assumptions about the world, find a shared language, and flourish as human beings expanding their souls.
For now, that dream will have to wait.

One in four of college students who have sought on-campus mental health assistance has seriously considered suicide, according to a new national study that The Center for the Study of Collegiate Mental Health at Penn State University released on Monday. The study found that of the 28,000 students questioned who received mental health services at 66 campus counseling centers nationwide, 11 percent had seriously considered suicide only before they began college, six percent only after starting college, and eight percent both prior to and after beginning college.

When asked whether this ratio accurately represents the mental health situation at Harvard, University Health Services Director of Behavioral Health and Academic Counseling Paul Barreira that the number of Harvard students seeking mental health services who have seriously considered suicide is much lower than the national statistic, since the proportion of students who receive these services is considerably higher than the national norm.

“Given how many students we see, it’s a much different figure for us,” Barreira said, noting that surveys consistently report that 40-50 percent of each graduating class has sought out on-campus mental health services at least once.

Barreira attributes this high participation rate to a remarkably small student to staff ratio—one staff member per 700 students as compared to one staff member per 1000-1500 students on average nationally—and the high visibility of mental health services on campus.

Student organizations such as the Student Mental Health Liaisons have been helping students navigate the mental health services available on campus and encouraging students to take advantage of them.

“Our aim is to eliminate the false notion of Harvard [is] an uncaring and unsupportive place by pointing students to various on-campus resources of which many, especially freshmen, are unaware,” said SMHL co-director Sara R. Zaidi ’11. Zaidi referenced a social norms campaign that SMHL launched this year to publicize Harvard-specific facts about mental health issues and services.

Some undergraduates were not completely convinced that enough students were seeking out mental health services and receiving adequate help. “Regardless of whether the statistic is surprisingly high or not, it is still high in an absolute sense when you consider that more people should be going to Mental Health Services at UHS for less serious problems, even if they just have problems sleeping or have relationship concerns,” Daniel M. Bear ’10 said. “People who go to mental health services are a small fraction of people who have seriously considered suicide.”

Helen Yu ’12 commented that while MHS and Room 13—a peer-to-peer counseling service that operates under UHS supervision—provide accessible and highly confidential help, not all students are aware of these services, and many are simply unwilling to go.

Harvard’s Recycling and Waste Manager won an annual Environmental Merit Award from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s New England divison today at its Earth Day celebrations in Boston. At the event, presenters highlighted Robert M. Gogan, Jr.’s commitment to recycling at Harvard, a cause he has championed for over a decade and a half.The program specifically cited Gogan’s efforts to distribute reusable office supplies and furniture to non-profit organizations such as Habitat for Humanity. It also mentioned Harvard’s annual Valentine’s Day cosmetics drive for a Cambridge woman’s shelter, and the “Stuff Sale,” during which students donate unwanted furniture to be resold at the beginning of each school year.The award comes at a time when Harvard is elevating the profile of its green programs, committing to greenhouse gas reductions this summer and staging a Sustainability Week in the fall, which featured an address from former Vice President Al Gore ’69 and banners declaring “Green Is The New Crimson.”Spring Greeney ’09 and Zach Arnold ’10 of the Environmental Action Committee said they nominated Gogan for the award because of his enthusiasm for environmental issues and his willingness to work closely with undergraduates.   “He is legitimately a hero to the entire campus environmental community,” Arnold said.A sense of optimism pervaded this year’s awards ceremony, as attendees and speakers repeatedly mentioned the recent elections that have ushered in an administration that prioritizes environmental issues. The ceremony began with a tribute to Lisa P. Jackson, the new administrator of the EPA. The Obama administration was also feted with a video of First Lady Michelle Obama’s recent address to the EPA, in which she said, “The EPA is at the center of President Obama’s highest priorities.”Another award winner with Harvard ties was Michael W. Shannon, a pediatric toxicologist and the first African-American full professor of pediatrics at the Harvard Medical School. Shannon, who passed away last month, was honored for his work on lead poisoning and clinical pharmacology, as well as his devotion to the environment and children’s health.This year’s Environmental Merit Awards included 12 lifetime achievement awards, nine individual awards, and over 20 awards to organizations, agencies, and student groups. The awards also marked the 39th annual celebration of Earth Day.

With a big weekend pair of home-and-away doubleheaders against Dartmouth looming ahead, its easy to overlook an innocuous non-conference game against Holy Cross. But Harvard softball (25-14, 10-6 Ivy) relished yesterday’s decisive 3-0 win over the Crusaders (12-29) as extra practice before the Big Green showdown to decide the Ivy North Division winner. “This is just a day for us to stay sharp. Get our pitchers some work seeing different batters, and our defense some work,” co-captain Bailey Vertovez said. “We didn’t really have many plays to make today. But, yeah, just stay sharp, get our bats swinging, and see some live pitching.” Working with little run support, freshman pitcher Rachel Brown highlighted the day with her efficiency in the circle. The righty threw just 51 pitches in four innings of work, allowing just one hit—no walks—and striking out seven. Sitting at 182 strikeouts on the season, Brown is now tied with Tasha Cupp ’98 atop the single-season strikeout leaderboard. But that outright record has to wait, as the rookie hurler was replaced in the fifth by classmate Julia Moore. “Our game plan was to split the game between Rachel and Jules, and we did that,” Crimson coach Jenny Allard said. “[Brown] went four innings, Jules went three.” Closing out the game, Moore had an equally auspicious line, allowing just one hit and one walk, while striking out two batters. Moore got into a jam in her first inning of relief, the fifth. With just one out, Moore walked Holy Cross’s Gwen Reimer, then plunked Elizabeth Foley. Moore got the next batter to fly out to left field, and, though the Crusaders deftly executed a double steal to advance both runners to scoring position, Moore got the next Holy Cross hitter to pop a dinky lob shot to the pitcher’s circle for the third and final out. The Crusaders struck again in the top of the seventh with the heart of their order at bat. Leading off, Mandy Correale dumped a single into left-center. But clean-up hitter Nicole Hitter lined a hot shot towards second that was wrangled in by rookie Jane Alexander, who quickly doubled up Correale at first. Alexander also supplied some icing on Harvard’s win from the offensive side. With the Crimson already up 2-0 in the fourth inning, freshman Marika Zumbro sliced a ball, which hugged the left-field line to stay fair, to land at second. Then two batters and two outs later, Alexander peppered the opposite field wall for a double, scoring Zumbro. The Harvard bats were slow to get started in the early part of the game, however. On just one hit, the Crimson was able to capitalize on some wild pitches to work Alexander around the diamond to get on the board in the first inning. “I thought we came out a little flat offensively,” Allard said. “We needed to make adjustments quicker in the game. We got enough runs to win, but we wanted more offensive production.” After rookie Whitney Shaw got hit by a pitch to start the third, the Crusaders replaced Melissa Pivonka with Katie Alexander in the circle. The reliever got two quick outs—striking out junior Jennifer Francis and getting classmate Jessica Pledger, a Crimson photographer, to fly out—but third-year Melissa Schellberg, who is also a Crimson sports editor lined a deep double off the base of the wall to score Shaw from first. “Our biggest goal today was to get on them early, score first, and keep the lead. And we did that,” Allard said. Noticeably absent from the Harvard lineup yesterday were sophomores Emily Henderson and Ellen Macadam. Henderson currently leads the Ivy League in steals with 14. But in such an inconsequential game, Allard opted to give the pair the day off in preparation for the weekend’s games. “We were just resting them,” Allard said of the sophomore duo. “They needed some rest for their muscles. They’re our speedsters, and we needed to rest their legs a little bit.” The Crimson had been slated for a fairly full week of non-conference matchups, but due to rain, Tuesday’s game against Providence was postponed indefinitely. The Crusaders requested that yesterday’s doubleheader be just one game, and Harvard obliged. But as a result, the Crimson had just one game to work out its kinks this week before battling Dartmouth for the top spot in the division. “One game was fine for today,” Allard conceded. “It gives us an opportunity to rest. Four games in a weekend is a lot.” —Staff writer Dixon McPhillips can be reached at fmcphill@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Polls don’t mean much when it comes to determining champions, but when the No. 2 men’s lightweight crew takes to the water tomorrow in New Haven, Conn., for the Goldthwait Cup against No. 1 Princeton and No. 4 Yale, the stage will undoubtedly be set for one of the nation’s most exciting dual races of the year.The three schools enter tomorrow’s race not only as three of the top four ranked crews in the country, but they also sport a combined 18-1 record in dual racing so far this season. The top-ranked Tigers are undefeated, with their closest win coming by a comfortable 3.3 seconds over Navy—the same crew the Crimson downed by just under a second last weekend. Princeton is coming off a 19.6 second demolition of Penn last weekend, the 11th consecutive regular season win for Old Nassau’s varsity eight.Yale, meanwhile, has won every race since a loss to Georgetown on April 5th.  While it is difficult to draw conclusions from the week-to-week results as lineups are shuffled and kinks ironed out before Sprints, there is little doubt that the three crews will be well-matched.“Any of the three boats are probably capable of winning,” captain Jeff Overington said. “I don’t think we feel like underdogs, but we realize that Princeton is very fast and they’re undefeated as well.”The stakes are only increased by the fact that it is the final race for the lightweights before Eastern Sprints in two weeks, where the Crimson will face the Bulldogs and Tigers once again, and therefore the last chance for Harvard to test itself under race conditions.“The championships are the top priority,” Overington said. “We know that no matter what, Princeton and Yale are going to be fast at Sprints, and ultimately the winner in two weeks is the Ivy League champion. This is a good preview for some of the top boats at Sprints and it’s a good opportunity to test ourselves.”The crews will also be competing for the Vogel Cup, awarded to the squad with the most overall points in the day’s five races. Last year, Princeton took the Goldthwait Cup by winning the varsity eight, but Yale took the other four races to claim the Vogel Cup. The Crimson finished third in four of the five races and finished second in the freshman eight.The Harvard heavyweights, meanwhile, have an intriguing matchup of their own in Annapolis, Md., where they will face Navy and Penn for the Adams Cup. The No. 4 Crimson is looking for its tenth consecutive Adams Cup win, but is also seeking a measure of revenge. Last year, Harvard’s first varsity took a 3.6 second win over the Midshipmen in Philadelphia, only to fall to Navy in the Petite Final at Eastern Sprints by less than a second.“You can’t really look at the results from week to week and expect to see a certain crew,” captain Teddy Schreck said. “It’s not really what we expect to see, but it’s more about what we can do ourselves to race. Sprints is the focus, and that’s the focus all year.”With just two weeks remaining before Sprints, however, time is running out for coaches tinkering with lineups and boats looking for a rhythm.  While the heavyweights have one race remaining before traveling to Sprints—next weekend’s Smith Cup battle with Northeastern—the time to put together a full effort is now.“We spent a lot of time drilling, working on technique,” Schreck said of this week’s preparations.  “We’re in a position right now where we’re really starting to gain some momentum.  This is a weekend we’ve looked to for awhile now as a chance to put it together and get into championship form.”—Staff writer Brad Hinshelwood can be reached at bhinshel@fas.harvard.edu.

Some teams simply thrive in the clutch, and the Harvard softball squad is one of them.Starting with a walkoff win in the first game of the season, the Crimson has made a habit of delivering thrilling late-inning victories.And heading into the final weekend of the regular season, Harvard (25-14, 10-6 Ivy) is exactly where it wants to be—in a close battle with time running out.Its bats are hot, its pitching is dominant, and in this weekend’s home-and-home series with division leader Dartmouth (20-18, 11-5 Ivy), the Crimson’s got a chance to clinch its third consecutive Ivy League North title on Soldiers Field.“I think we kind of make the joke that our style is to win it at the end,” freshman pitcher Rachel Brown said. “This team really shows a lot of heart, and we’re all really expecting to pull through in the end. Knowing that we need to win is going to really help us out.”The Crimson needs to win three of four in this weekend’s series to win the title—and the spot in the Ivy League Championship Series that comes along with it.“Our goal is to win four, we know we have to take three, but the faster we get those wins in, the better,” co-captain Hayley Bock said. “We’re going to try to beat them no matter what field we’re on.”Harvard is coming off an impressive weekend at Brown, where the offense broke out of a persistent slump in a big way, scoring 37 runs as the Crimson took three of four from the Bears. Co-captain Bailey Vertovez led the offensive resurgence, batting an incredible .692 last week with a .765 on-base percentage, six runs scored, six RBI and four doubles en route to being honored as the Ivy League Player of the Week.But she wasn’t alone. Every starter had at least one hit, with the team combining for 43 on the weekend.“We’ve just been focusing on having quality at-bats at the plate, keeping our defense solid,” Bock said. “Our offense has really picked up—scoring 23 runs in a day is indicative of the kind of hitting we’re capable of, and we’re just going to keep that going.”Harvard’s bats have helped take the pressure off of its pitching staff, which currently ranks second among Ivies with a 2.56 team ERA. “It’s such a huge help,” Brown said. “I think a lot of pitchers will agree that you pitch differently when you have a lead, because you know the other team might be down, so you want to do your best to keep them down. You go straight after their hitters.”Brown has been the anchor of the staff throughout her rookie season, as she ranks second in the Ancient Eight with a 1.37 ERA and first in strikeouts, with 182.That strikeout total ties the all-time single season record, matching the total of Tasha Cupp ’98. “I’m sure she’ll get [the record],” Vertovez said. “I’m excited with our pitching staff. They’ve had their ups and downs this season, but we’re peaking at the right time right now.”Brown will be on the mound for Game 1 of the weekend series tomorrow afternoon at Dartmouth, as the streaking Crimson offense will try to take advantage of the weaknesses in the Big Green’s pitching staff.Freshman Hillary Barker and sophomore Devin Lindsay have seen the bulk of the time in the circle for Dartmouth, but neither has an ERA under four. The Big Green has been powered by its bats, particularly those of junior Alyssa Parker and freshmen Molly Khalil. Parker leads the team with a .327 average, while Khalil has belted nine doubles and four home runs. Khalil was named Ivy League Rookie of the Week after she hit .438 in Dartmouth’s five games last week. As Harvard has been heating up, the Big Green has cooled off a bit, splitting a four-game series with third-place Yale last week and dropping a game to Vermont yesterday. But with so much riding on this series, it will be a matter of which team has the focus to grind out the necessary victories.If the Crimson wins the division title, it will do so Sunday at home on Senior Day, giving the weekend an added significance for Bock and Vertovez.  “It makes it that much more exciting and that much more emotional to play for—everyone’s playing to continue our season, and to be playing to continue our final season is that much more exciting,” Bock said.For Harvard, and its seniors especially, it’s crunch time, and the team wouldn’t want it any other way.“Just being one game behind is very exciting for us,” Vertovez said. “Our bats are alive, everyone’s ready to play, it’s supposed to be gorgeous out, and hopefully it will be a great [weekend] for Harvard softball.”—Staff writer Kate Leist can be reached at kleist@fas.harvard.edu.

The VOID is that empty time between 5am and 8am every night where there’s no one on gchat, no sound but your roommate’s blissful snoring, and nothing to think about besides the work you’re not getting done.  But you’re not alone, FlyBy is here to guide you through.
Do you have what it takes to pay the toll?  You know you have to...it would be an absolute sin to work this weekend.  The weather will be amazing!  Too many sweet things to do: show a little skin for some tanning by the Charles, play some softball at Cumnock Field, have an intimate meal outside at Daedalus, perhaps...taking advantage of youth, you know?
But FlyBy doesn't give two shits about that little blueprint you cooked up.  There are 99 things on the internet you must see, apparently (FlyBy recommends 14, 26, 32!, 37, 73, 86...you know you wanna do this...90, and 95).  Ok, that was actually kind of harsh...don't click that.
Inspiration. In honor of the retirement of a great player, and an even better human being.

We have no evidence for this accusation and are basing these findings entirely on hearsay, but once again in the weekend leading up to the Harvard/Dartmouth baseball series, a "random, unprovoked" act of vandalism has tainted Harvard's athletic facilities.
Every year Crimson baseball plays a home/road weekend slate with the Big Green, spending one day in Hanover and the other in Cambridge. Dartmouth fans are world-class hecklers, known for insightful drunken banter and tireless roadtripping. But as much as Flyby respects these traits in a fan, each year it appears that a group of unruly Big Green supporters take the baseball rivalry to an even higher level. To hear about their latest antics (depicted in the photo to the right), read on after the jump.
According to baseball team lore (i.e. captain Harry Douglas), past debauchery has included digging up parts of the baseball diamond, including a herculean effort last season to uproot the deeply entrenched home plate of O'Donnell Field. Now, you may be wondering, as we are, how these actions make any sense. Haha we messed up Harvard's field, but wait, doesn't Dartmouth have to play there tomorrow and won't this be just as annoying for them? It appears that this question dawned on the current regime of "unidentified" vandals and prompted them to lash out in a much more practical fashion: by digging up part of the H on Soldiers Field. Ahh, enlightened shenanigans. Don't vandalize the field to be used, maim ANOTHER field!
Now, to be fair, as you can see from the photo, the Big Green supporters kept the damage within reason. By only digging up the red part of the H, the perpetrators allowed Harvard's maintenance crew to easily patch up the offensive spot. And admittedly, we tip our cap to the Dartmouth fans for showing that they actually care deeply about Ivy League sports. Or at least about dissing Harvard. Either way, this intrepid FlyBy reporter is headed up to Hanover for the weekend series to see Big Green fans at their belligerent finest, when the two schools fight it out for real on the diamond. Stay tuned for a sneak peek into the world of true Ivy sports fanatics.
P.S. Dartmouth sucks.

For those who foster anything from a keener-than-normal interest in the bushy-tailed, beady-eyed rodents that inhibit the Yard to a flatout bizarre obsession with Harvard squirrels, fear not! Although society may look down upon you, the Harvard Squirrel Archive (yes, you read that correctly) will teach you more about the long history between squirrel and school.
Citing everything from University records to John Singleton Copley paintings to Gilmore Girls, the Archive contains more information than anyone could possibly want to know about the squirrel and Harvard life.   FlyBy took the liberty to peruse the Archive (read: pore over the site  in a state of utter disbelief) and found five things that every Harvard student should know. Find out what they are after the jump.
1) Harvard may have been the spot where the challenging, rewarding, and of course, very popular sport squirrel fishing originated. (It is exactly what it sounds like.)
2)  Squirrels don’t mind getting close…sometimes a bit too close. The Archive cites a number of Crimson articles about squirrels crawling into student dorms, tearing at bed sheets (while beds are occupied), and running up pant legs  in broad daylight. Kinky.
3) The overabundance of squirrels in the Yard has long been a problem, spurring talks of giving squirrels birth control that have persisted since the 1930s. Given the randy behavior noted in #2, that doesn’t come as a surprise.
4) Harvard squirrels are dirty but not necessarily smart. (According to Gilmore Girls)
5) Harvard squirrels are not afraid of machines. The Archive documents one particularly disurbing episode involving a squirrel in a Xerox machine. Let's just say it gives new meaning to the phrase "bad experience at Widener."
Okay, so maybe every Harvard student doesn’t have to know any of these things. At all. Under any circumstance. Regardless, if anyone really did want to learn about the showdown between squirrels and dogs, the evolution of the connotation behind the word “squirrel,” and every single Harvard-related newspaper article about squirrel encounters, the Harvard Squirrel Archive is surely a new addition to the Bookmarks Bar. For FlyBy and the remaining 99.99% of the population, this is just another huge WTF: a test case in what can  happen when the internet and really bored people interact.

In time for pre-frosh weekend, the Harvard Student Agency has released a free program for your iPhone (or iTouch) called the Rover: The Unofficial Guide to Life at Harvard.
After downloading the program, it asks you if it can use your current location. Then you can choose from four headings: all, food/drink, shopping, and nightlife. Within each heading you can then select an acceptable distance away—don't make yourself walk further than you have to.
On Rover even the most adventuresome Harvard student will find new places to go. There are over 900 reviews of restaurants and shops in Cambridge and Boston. There are plenty of categories to choose from. Looking for the occult? You won't have to walk far. Mystic Rosa, according to Rover, is only .11 miles from Flyby's current location in a Straus music practice room. Unfortunately if you're looking for a burrito, you're going to have to hunt for them in the Mexican category.  More features after the jump.
From each restaurant or shop's page, it is possible to go to a map, call the place, or go to their website in one click—and the restaurants hours and a short review are just scroll away.
There's some useful stuff here. Who knew there was a Malaysian restaurant 1.64 miles away with prices lower than you would find at most places in Harvard Square?
Rover also has a nifty deals button that you can click to see the latest discounts. Bon appetit, froshies.

It's a typical Thursday night dinner at Annenberg, a quiet night to end the week, complete with mediocre food and...upperclassmen crashers? Oh wait, it's just Eleganza, yet another student group shamelessly infiltrating the sacred space in order to promote an upcoming event. But what was likely intended to be a groundbreaking-ly exciting antic fell flat in front of the disinterested freshmen. After waiting 11 minutes past their intended go-time of 6 PM in anticipation of more viewers, the Eleganzans lost their surprise factor and were hardly a sensational sweep. Read more about their attempted takeover after the jump.
The organization members, after gathering near the John Adams statue awaiting their cue, began an anti-climactic walk down the aisles of Annenberg while one member blared--well, more like played softly--music from his ipod speakers. After every individual busted out his or her runway walk towards the center of the room, the group came together to show off their dancing skills to the crowd. Oh, did we mention that you should come to Eleganza?
The inspiration, according to apparent master-and-commander of this stunt Angela Su '12, was the scene from a Gossip Girl episode where Little J decides that a charity gala would be a prime opportunity for an impromptu fashion show. Actually, it wasn't really the inspiration, but that's the effect the organizers were trying to go for. Apparently...there's a difference somewhere.
Except this spontaneous fashion show happened to be missing, well, the fashion (not to mention it wasn't actually spontaneous). The Eleganza devotees wore only green t-shirts with "Jack Willis" (who?) on the front, and "Eleganza" predictably splayed across the back. If that's groundbreaking couture, FlyBy fears for the upcoming season's fashion trends.
The organizers insisted the promotion was a success, and Su herself said, "The crowd loved it, and we really showed some Eleganza spirit." Another participant's attempts to acknowledge the lack of volume from the music were quickly overridden.
A group of female freshmen diners labeled the display as "unnecessary" and "not really that big of a surprise." Considering how many emails about Eleganza this writer has received in the past week (8 emails and 3 facebook messages, according to a Gmail search), this attitude is not surprising. Maybe their strategy should be rethought. When asked about whether they would be going to Eleganza on Saturday these same freshmen said, "Probably not."
