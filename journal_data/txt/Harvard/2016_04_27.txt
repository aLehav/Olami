After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Has anyone ever loved you more than life? That’s how I will love you,” says Paul Dédalus (Quentin Dolmaire) as he turns to leave the home of his love interest, Esther (Lou Roy-Lecollinet). The sun is already out, and the two have just kissed for the first time. Mere hours before, she attended a party he threw solely to see her; he, lacking confidence, pretended to ignore her as she danced with other men. When she picked up her jacket, he picked up his courage and offered her a walk back home.
This tender scene comprises just a snippet of “Trois Souvenirs de ma Jeunesse” (My Golden Days), the original French title of which translates to “Three Memories of my Youth.” Besides the love story, the other two “memories” involve the early death of Paul’s mother and Paul’s trip to the USSR with his best friend as a student. However, it is clear that for director Arnaud Desplechin, both childhood trauma and teenage friendship pale in comparison to adolescent romance: He gives the latter significantly more screentime than the former two combined. In fact, Desplechin is so absorbed in Paul and Esther’s love story that he seems completely content with the messy narrative of the first memory and the simplistic—if not unabashedly sloppy— transitions between different episodes.
In this regard, “Trois Souvenirs” is not a polished film. But it is deliberately not so; rather, the film is intended to be personal and intimate. Much like a story told by a close friend, it drifts here and there and rushes through background information when the storyteller loses interest. The style is consistent with the auteur tradition of French cinema, in which directors such as Jean-Luc Godard and François Truffaut have famously parted from the rules of classical cinema in search of a more personal, earnest means of filmmaking. In the case of “Trois Souvenirs” in particular, the story follows a group of young people who draw agency from their carefree ignorance of the rules. The whimsical style thus suits the film’s content perfectly.
Desplechin allows himself much creative freedom and showcases his gift for innovative cinematic storytelling. Specifically, he demonstrates in this film a quintessential talent of great directors: The ability to capture a certain mood through sound and image. When Esther arrives at Paul’s party, the film suddenly shifts to slow motion, and the background music fades away. Esther, wearing a red checked wool jacket and scarlet lipstick, slowly removes her light blue scarf and looks around with weary eyes; although Paul remains offscreen, his stunned, ecstatic, tender gaze is strongly present. And when Paul first meets Esther, the screen splits unevenly into different parts, and a spatial montage is presented between all kinds of simultaneous movement—a car wheel rolling, Paul’s friends chatting—before finally converging to two images of the protagonists. Though audiences may forget aspects of the plot, these moments of brilliance and energy, in which feelings of longing, hesitation, excitement and anxiety penetrate the screen, sear themselves into memory.
The dialogues are also extremely well-written: Whether the protagonists are smoking on the sidewalk, relaxing in their rooms, or chatting at parties, their words flow freely. The conversations cover a variety of topics, from the relationship between the sexes to anatomy and art and religion, grounded in an easy wit and casualness that recalls scripts by Richard Linklater and Quentin Tarantino. When Paul teaches Esther Go and takes her to an art gallery, they talk about the game and the paintings with a mutual understanding of the subtext of their relationship. If the phrase “the art of flirtation” existed in the dictionary, these dialogues would be included as explanations. Even more brilliant are the love letters that Paul and Esther exchange. “Your existence is as strong as a mountain,” writes Paul in one scene. “It makes me and the world around me tremble, and that is comforting…. For as long as you exist, I know I am not alone, trapped in my dreams.” Such words, spoken softly and accompanied by the faces of the two lead actors—imbued with youthful sorrow and steely determination—serve as a reminder of just how beautiful it is to fall in love.
In a playful, exuberant, and fresh tone, “Trois Souvenirs de ma Jeunesse” tells a beautiful story of the world of yesterday. It is at once a midsummer love affair, a gentle goodnight kiss, and a secret lover’s subtle gaze to be remembered and relished long into the future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Thoughtful opinion pieces in the past have disagreed persuasively with the claim that demographics do not matter in the design, delivery, and evaluation of Harvard's Counseling and Mental Health Services. Diversify CAMHS’s survey is a case in point: It suggests direct interventions CAMHS could roll out to address problems of inordinate attrition among non-white, foreign-born, first-time users of mental health services. Demographic factors such as nativity, ethnicity, and socioeconomic insecurity do contribute to the alarmingly high rates of attrition among first-time users of university-based mental health services. But, as is the case with far too many conversations about mental health, stakeholders have yet to think, talk, and write about mental health services comprehensively. Despite efforts to optimize front-end client flow at CAMHS, much less thought has touched on enhancing back-end flow.
A survey of the history of CAMHS’s back-end procedures displays troubling inconsistencies in its commitment to one of higher education's long-standing practices: Evaluation. Counseling and Mental Health Services, as its name indicates, is charged to provide services. But if the current design of its service delivery system is any indication, CAMHS has yet to meet the challenge of comprehensiveness of its charge to provide services.
CAMHS’s evaluation procedures leave much to be desired in two respects. First, they do not promptly invite students to reflect upon and assess the quality and effectiveness of the counseling session immediately afterwards. Second, they do not ask students whether demographic factors may have inflected their experience of the counseling session.
The University mandates evaluations by students for virtually all courses, workshops, and conferences. Moreover, University Health Services already sends student evaluations following ordinary visits. Why doesn’t UHS embed a similar evaluation system for mental health visits? We do not see any reason why CAMHS instead maintains a culture of inconsistent solicitation of student feedback, nor do we understand why UHS does not charge the firm contracted to design its electronic evaluation systems to incorporate a component for CAMHS.
When the University refuses to apply equal scrutiny to its mental and physical health services, it perpetuates the stigmatizing and harmful culture of disparate coverage of mental health. Additionally, it subjects many students to the risks of disengagement and withdrawal. As a custodian of the future, the University has the capacity—and, indeed, the responsibility—to interrogate and transform that culture of disparate coverage of mental health. We urge UHS to embed a procedure to solicit student feedback immediately following each CAMHS visit.
Why not design a check-out survey that offers each client quick and thoughtful closure while equipping providers with feedback on how to enhance the client experience at CAMHS? We designed such a survey for a Science and Religion course we took at the Divinity School last semester. In addition to being replicable and scalable, the survey is as rapid and indicator-friendly as the check-in every client has to complete before meeting a counselor at CAMHS. The survey’s 10 questions invite students to pause and reflect on how their demographics—and their assigned counselor’s—permeated the visit. Asking such questions with greater consistency would affirm CAMHS’ openness to learning from student responses and equip CAMHS to expand the relevance of its services to our increasingly diverse University community.
For many of us, college or graduate school is the first time we engage with our mental health. It should not be the last time. At present, the University’s message to students who seek help with mental health transitions is clear and bleak: Their views on the quality and impact of their experiences at CAMHS do not merit examination. This message reinforces the tacit and harmful assumption that mental health transitions are a form of deviance and failure. We do not and cannot subscribe to that view. Rather, we consider mental health transitions to be an expected dimension of many students' experiences and development within a highly competitive—and for some, culturally unfamiliar—environment.
Toni Morrison, this year’s Norton Professor of Poetry, has prophesied that, in the third millennium, “universities alone may very well be the last preserve of free thought, of independent inquiry, of simple caring for.”
Simple caring for.
The University fails to care for its own when it does not ask those entrusted in its care whether its providers have indeed provided care, safety, and healing. As long as CAMHS fails to solicit student feedback after each visit, it will deny its own care providers important opportunities to enhance and fine-tune their interventions and treatment frameworks; more importantly, it will deny students their right to effective and relevant care. Embedding an insightful, onsite, post-visit evaluation system for CAMHS visits is a matter of ethical and educational responsibility for the University.
Caring deeply about our University community requires questioning troubling inconsistencies in CAMHS’s solicitation of student evaluations, which in turn will help us take better care of the experiences of our students and future citizens. Asking CAMHS to be more prompt and consistent in soliciting feedback from students is about engendering a kinder, healthier, freer future—about simple caring for. The University’s capacity to harness the promise of 21st-century diversity is at stake.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The decision to put Harriet Tubman on the front of the twenty dollar bill and remodel the backs of the five and ten dollar bills to include activists, artists, and civil rights leaders—all female except for Martin Luther King, Jr.—is a fitting remembrance of true national heroes and a significant improvement over earlier plans. The striking symbolism of the decision is also, however, a stark reminder of the challenges that persist for women and minorities in America.  As we applaud this change and continue working for more nuanced commemorations of American history, we must remain vigilant against inequity in our own time.
As a matter of policy, the design changes reflect a necessary rethinking of an earlier plan to displace Alexander Hamilton from the front of the ten dollar bill. Replacing Andrew Jackson, a slave holder and the author of genocidal policies against native peoples, makes far more sense. The only criticisms to be made of the current plan are the length of time it will take to go into effect and the awkwardness of keeping Jackson on the back of a bill that includes a former slave. While practical considerations take precedence, we hope that the these changes occur as quickly as possible and that the Treasury reconsiders Jackson’s continued place on the currency.
That said, placing Tubman, a former slave and ardent abolitionist, on the twenty is a welcome tribute to the kind of hero that deserves more recognition in the national consciousness. Not only did Tubman overcome the barriers erected in front of people of her race and gender, but she largely did so by force of arms, helping to plan John Brown’s raid on Harper’s Ferry and later leading Union troops. It is little wonder that Brown called her “General Tubman”—indeed, as one National Geographic writer notes, she was “the first woman in U.S. history to lead a military expedition.” A trailblazer in every respect who gave no quarter in her struggle against established oppression, Tubman more than deserves this kind of recognition.
Harvard students should also note Tubman’s ties to Boston and her slightly more attenuated ones to Harvard itself. Tubman helped organize the 54th Massachusetts—the first regiment of African-American soldiers recruited by the Union—and was with it at the disastrous Battle of Fort Wagner, South Carolina. One of the dead that day was the regiment’s colonel, Robert Gould Shaw, who had dropped out of Harvard to serve his country. His name can be seen in Memorial Hall today.
Part of considering this history means redoubling efforts to memorialize it. Just as universities are grappling with the integral role slavery played in their early histories, government at all levels must initiate a similar process of remembrance, in part by elevating the stature of figures like Tubman in America’s national pantheon. Going forward, all Americans—and especially young Americans—have a role to play in sustaining the increased historical consciousness that has catalyzed changes on campuses and beyond.
Finally, as this change rolls out, we must consider the unfinished nature of the struggle initiated by Tubman and the other leaders who will join her on the currency. White women continue to earn, on average, 76 cents for every dollar earned by a white man, and for black women that number drops to 60 cents. For Latinas, it is 55. These statistics are the inescapable economic consequences of discrimination that symbolic changes to our currency, however significant, cannot fix. Public policy solutions are the sole way to undo such injustices. While celebrating Tubman and the many other women and people of color who have played decisive roles in American history is crucial, so too is ensuring the continuation of their efforts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you’re petty enough, you can try to make it about a tabloid-worthy divorce drama, but that would be hard.
“Lemonade,” Beyoncé’s latest visual album, featuring poetry from the inimitable Warsan Shire, is about more than that. It is about (and for) black women—black trans women, black women-of-center folks, black people who sometimes feel like women or identify with femininity and womanhood in some way—what this world does to them, what black men do to them, what white people do to all of us. It is about fathers and their mistakes, their sorrows. And it is about grandmothers and their lemonade.
My grandmother is a force. She is made of solid rose gold. She can make lemonade.
Every woman and transgender and gender non-conforming person of color I’ve talked to about this album has had a host of complicated and hard-to-articulate thoughts about it, but they have all said one thing: that they wish they could walk down a street, taking a bat to glass and toxic masculinity and other comparably fragile things like Beyoncé does in “Hold Up.”
Beyoncé is first and foremost acknowledging the toxicity of masculinity. But where many people get lost in trying to convey the complicated intersections of oppression within the black community without demonizing black men, Beyoncé treads gently, with love. In “Forward,” she depicts black women holding photographs of black men. In one segment, Michael Brown’s mother, her chest adorned with beads, holds her son’s graduation photo. She is shaking her head. In a physical and metaphysical sense, something of sorrowful impossibility passes between her, the photo, and the black viewer. Of course, I do not know the feeling, but I know something microscopically like it. I feel it now, shaking my head, my eyes welling up with words I don’t know how to speak. A tear falls down her cheek. She opens her mouth. The segment ends.
“Lemonade” is an album that made me want to call my mom. It is an album about imagining a greater reality in which trans inclusionary black feminism (a redundant term, as no true feminism should be trans exclusionary), is a universal ethos in the black community. In “Anger,” we hear Malcolm X’s voice over images of black women—black women who look like my aunties and the women at the beauty salon I go to back home—smiling somewhat uncomfortably. Malcolm X, who was not not a misogynist, declares, “The most disrespected person in America is the black woman. The most unprotected person in America is the black woman. The most neglected person in America is the black woman.” Beyoncé returns, pausing, making it clear she does not want “protection” as in night in shining armor, she wants “respect” as in shift in community values. She sings, “I am the dragon breathing fire,” and the beat kicks back in.
And here is where many films and bad sitcom episodes would peg Beyoncé the tragic and “crazy” cheated upon woman—mad and black in every sense of both words. But Beyoncé precludes this reduction entirely. She is, in all of “Lemonade,” reconciling herself with the word “crazy.” A word thrown constantly at black women. She rips the word back and pops it in her own mouth like spicy hard candy from the corner store. In “Hold Up,” Beyoncé asks “What’s worse, being jealous or crazy?” and after shattering a couple dozen car and store windows, moves on to “What’s worse, looking jealous or crazy? Jealous and crazy. Or like, being walked all over lately...I’d rather be crazy.” She re-situates herself inside of the term crazy, and re-situates the men who spit the term at her as trampling, culpable beings.
The video ends on hope—on black babies and grandmas at their 90th birthday parties and black folks adorned in lace perched in a mossy tree. But the video makes room for rage, too. It makes room for crazy. It makes room for hurt.
At the end of “Anger,” with a telling loss of fire, Beyoncé asks, “Why can’t you see me?” It’s a sort of desperation I feel here every day.  Directly thereafter, at the beginning of “Apathy,” she asks, “So what are you gonna say at my funeral, now that you’ve killed me? Here lies the body of the love of my life, whose heart I broke without a gun to my head. Here lies the mother of my children, both living and dead. Rest in peace, my true love, who I took for granted.” This is about more than an affair. It is about a community—the black community—and how we can better love one another.
With “Lemonade,” Beyoncé gives me space. She gives me space to be whatever amount of woman as long as I be. She gives me space to be joyful, to be spiritual, to be enraged, to be tired, to forgive, to be crazy. She posits black love as a solution, as hope, a salve, but she does not fault black love for its imperfections, does not fault self-love for its absences, does not fault women for their uncomfortable smiles.
I—like Beyoncé, I assume—am tired of being made to feel like a problem. My feelings about this album are complicated—it is a text that will require further study—but I know one thing. With “Lemonade” Beyoncé sits her intended audience down and says to us: Look at all of these ways to be “black woman.” Look at all of these things that you can be. Here, this says in mourning. This says nonbinary. This says laughing. None of these say “problem.”

Wayne Pacelle, president and CEO of the Humane Society, and Michael Pollan, a food writer, urged consumers to support higher standards for farm animal protection at an event held in Memorial Church Monday night.
Sponsored by the Harvard Animal Law and Policy Program and the Coop, the event featured a conversation between Pollan and Pacelle, two authors who have called for the humane treatment of animals.
Pacelle encouraged audience members to recognize the importance of farm animal protection and take actions to make the food system more humane. An advocate for informed consumer habits, Pacelle supported a ballot initiative in Massachusetts that aims to require all eggs sold in the state to be cage-free.
Pacelle traced the origins of what he called farm animal cruelty to the age of industrialization. The application of industrial methods to farming has compromised animal welfare, he argued, and the mistreatment of farm animals, which he said are now subjected to worsening conditions, has “gone too far.”
Still, the case for animal protection is relatively new because, in the past, people knew where their food came from, Pollan said.
Pollan said the public has recognized the increasingly harmful animal practices of several food companies, in part due to investigations by the Humane Society and various undercover videos, which he said has influenced public opinion against animal cruelty.
“People’s tolerance for these systems is much less,” he said.
Several audience members drew personal connections between their lives and the authors’ discussion.
Shannon Pastuszak, an audience member, said she attended the event because of her own involvement in the farm animal protection movement.
“I am a supporter of the ballot measure in November, and I’m helping to raise awareness for that in the state of Massachusetts. I’m just a concerned citizen and an educated consumer, and I’m a vegan myself,” she said.
Eric D. LaGuardia, another audience member and student at the Graduate School of Education, said he was drawn to the event because he recently completed a final paper about animal cruelty in which he cited Pacelle.
“It’s a crisis management paper regarding Seaworld’s answer to Blackfish and [Pacelle] was pretty much instrumental in this new partnership with Seaworld’s CEO Joel Manby to end the orca breeding program,” he said.
LaGuardia said that he appreciated Pacelle’s balanced approach to discussing standards for farm animal protection, adding that the event inspired him to learn more about these issues.
Pacelle ended the conversation with a call for legislators to take into account moral issues when making laws related to the food system.

Leaders of the Undergraduate Council are banking $2,500 on a plan to improve Harvard’s social scene, and the first test will involve fajitas and chips.
After a year of planning, the first installment of the UC’s Club 1636, an initiative to provide campus-wide social events, is set to take place Wednesday evening in the basement of Tex-Mex eatery Border Cafe.
The program aims to create “partnerships with bars and clubs in the area for Harvard Only 18+ nights,” UC President Shaiba Rather ’17 and UC Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17 wrote in an email to undergraduates.
Rather, Banks, and UC Student Initiatives Committee Chair Madeleine H. Stern ’18 sponsored legislation Monday to allocate half of the Council’s $5,000 “Crazy Ideas Fund” to rent out and staff the Border Cafe basement from 11 p.m. until 1 a.m., as well as provide free appetizers to attendees. The Council passed the legislation unanimously.
“This fits our compelling interest of increased social spaces, and will also serve to help the mental health here on campus,” Elm Yard Representative Victor C. Agbafe ’19 said, referring to the four Council priorities that the UC voted on earlier this semester.
In response to a question from a UC representative about funding alcohol at the event, Banks emphasized that the Council’s funds would go to paying for wait staff, but not towards paying for the alcohol itself. Undergraduates who are of legal age may purchase drinks at the event for themselves. The UC has been prohibited from funding alcohol ever since a 2007 agreement with then-Interim Dean of the College David R. Pilbeam.
Banks said he hopes Club 1636 will provide more social opportunities for undergraduates.
“With all the reforms that are going on when it comes to exclusive spaces, it’s really important the UC spearhead initiatives to create inclusive spaces and… provide alternatives when they don’t exist,” Banks said. This year, Harvard’s unrecognized final clubs have come under heightened levels of scrutiny from administrators; at the same time, those administrators are seeking to recenter undergraduate social life on campus.
According to Banks, Border Cafe has agreed to host the late night social event in its basement every Thursday next semester if the UC can find sufficient funds for it. The UC is also looking into other possible locations to host the event, including FiRE+iCE and John Harvard’s Brewery.
UC representatives said they eventually intend to make Club 1636 a weekly event.
Future installments of Club 1636 may depend on the event’s initial popularity. During Monday’s meeting, Banks pointed out that the amount of money the Council was spending for Wednesday’s event was “obviously not sustainable” for a weekly initiative.
“If there are a lot of people that go, then hopefully we can prove to businesses in the Square that they’re going to get a lot of money,” Banks said. “So we’ll let capitalism do its work.”
This is the first time the Crazy Ideas Fund will be used, but the Council does not plan to regularly dip from it for Club 1636.
“Hopefully the success of this event will pave the way for future partnerships and an alternative for social spaces,” Stern said.
Although Banks said the UC hopes Club 1636 will help increase social spaces for freshmen, he noted many freshmen may choose to go to Wednesday’s Freshman Formal instead.
“This is... unfortunately also the Freshman Formal, so this event is not necessarily what it’ll look like when it’s in full-swing in the fall,” Banks said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At a time when Harvard’s campus was deeply divided by gender and women studied at neighboring Radcliffe College, a small group of women became the first female members of The Crimson.
Joan Simons Brown ’51 was among them, serving as the paper’s Radcliffe Chief Business Representative in the spring of 1950. Brown died a few weeks ago on March 29 at the age of 86, according to an obituary published in the Manchester Journal.
Brown and fellow Crimson editor Thomas Cunningham Simons ’50, who served as Business Manager in the spring and fall of 1949, married after graduation and left Cambridge for California. The couple had four children. She dedicated her life to education  and her family.
After spending time in California, Brown served as chair of the board at the Hartford College For Women in Connecticut. She was also a founding member of the Westledge School, an experimental multiracial secondary school, and served on the boards of Bellarmine University, Berea College, and the Louisville Water Company.
The school Brown attended during her undergraduate years bears little resemblance to the one Harvard students know today. Radcliffe students were not  allowed to study in Lamont Library—the main undergraduate library—and gender integration sparked much debate. For example, a 1950 Crimson headline read, “Harvard, Radcliffe Go Steady for 71 Years; Few Sanctums Left for Men.”
“As the Harvard and Radcliffe communities overlap, even extracurriculars were forced to take cognizance of the courtship,” the unattributed article adds. At The Crimson, Joan McPartlin Mahoney ’49 became the newspaper’s first Radcliffe Correspondent in the fall of 1947, paving the way for more women like Brown to join the staff.
After the death of her first husband, Brown married James K. Brown, a former classmate. In her later years, Brown was an active golfer and member of the Green Mountain Girls and the National Society of Colonial Dames, according to the Manchester Journal obituary.
Her funeral service took place earlier this month, and Brown spent her final days surrounded by pictures of family members, according to the obituary.

High school applicants to Harvard will have more options to indicate their gender identity through the Common Application starting this summer.
The Common Application, the standardized admissions form used by Harvard and 624 other schools, announced on Monday that students will be asked to state their “sex assigned at birth” and have an additional free-response option to describe their gender identity. Colleges will also have the choice to ask more questions to receive clearer information on applicants’ gender.
These changes come in the wake of heightened attention to BGLTQ issues at Harvard, including the introduction of gender-neutral housing and bathrooms in all upperclassmen houses, as well as the option to choose preferred gender pronouns during registration.
Students lauded the proposed changes as an indication of increased administrative support for gender diversity on campus.
“The change is good. Recognizing that people have gender identities different than the sexes they were assigned at birth is critical,” W. Powell Eddins ’16 said. “It will also be helpful in helping the admissions committee get a fuller picture of each applicant, especially transgender applicants.”
Joshua D. Blecher-Cohen ’16, an intern at the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, said the changes are a “new step forward in including BGLTQ students in application process.”
“The changes allow admissions officers to be more attentive to the diversity of the applicant pool in the incoming class,” he said. “[They] really send the message that the college admissions process is proactively trying to be inclusive of transgender and gender nonconforming students.”
Despite agreeing that the changes are “a really positive and affirming step,” Noah R. Wagner ’18, who uses the pronoun they, said they were concerned about how institutions would use the information.
“It’s difficult for students to know whether institutions will use this information against them or rather, to include more diverse voices into school community,” Wagner said.
Similarly, Blecher-Cohen argued the changes were “only half of the way of where it should be.”
“Since 2010, advocates have been pushing for not just gender identity but also sexual orientation, and the recent change just doesn’t yet make it that far,” he said.
The Common Application changes follows ongoing conversation with participating schools, high school counselors, and Common Application Advisory Committee members, according to the application’s website.

Nicco Mele, former deputy publisher for the Los Angeles Times, will take over as director of the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy in July.
Mele currently works at the University of Southern California and was formerly an adjunct lecturer at the Shorenstein Center. He will take over for interim director Thomas E. Patterson, who succeeded formed director Alex S. Jones in July 2015, Harvard Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf announced Monday.
Patterson said he was excited about Mele’s appointment, especially considering his background in digital media.
“I think it was a terrific appointment. I think he’s perfect for the job,” Patterson said. “There are a lot more students here that are interested in how you use digital media to get out your message… the great thing about [Mele] is that he has a foot in all of those places, and that’s different from our previous permanent directors.”
Jones, who was director of the Shorenstein Center while Mele was an adjunct lecturer, echoed Patterson’s endorsement, describing him as “a superb choice.”
“I think that Nicco has the full package. He is one of the real founding fathers of the digital technology revolution and has a really deep understanding of it,” he said. “I think that is, of course, an enormous strength for the Shorenstein Center.”
Mele said he returned to Harvard both because of his love of teaching, and because he hopes to address what he characterized as the problems media is facing with the onset of technology.
“I think that our media is in a state of crisis. The business models that have funded journalism for hundreds of years are collapsing,” he said. “I feel a great sense of urgency for us to carefully examine… the challenges that technology is introducing into policymaking, into the political cycle, and into the political process.”
In a press release, Elmendorf described Mele as an “innovative” scholar.
“We are thrilled that he is returning to the Kennedy School to work with faculty, students, and scholars to advance our understanding of these critically important issues,” he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Planned Parenthood Action Fund, advocated for widespread accessibility to reproductive healthcare at the Institute of Politics Tuesday evening.
Planned Parenthood consists of more than 650 health centers across the nation that provide sexual and reproductive healthcare. According to Richards, every month the organization provides healthcare services to two and a half million people in its health centers, and to six million people online.
Planned Parenthood has become highly controversial in the political sphere, largely due to its federal funding and abortion services. However, according to Richards, federal dollars do not fund abortions, which are paid for by other sources, including private donors, foundations, and fees.
“I believe abortion should be safe and legal,” Richards said. “We do more at Planned Parenthood on any given week, right here in Massachusetts, to prevent unintended pregnancy, and the need for abortion, than the people who are outside picketing our health centers.”
Abortions only make up of three percent of Planned Parenthood’s total services, she added. The centers also provide sexual education, contraception to prevent unintended pregnancies, cancer screening and prevention, and tests and treatments for sexually transmitted infections.
“People have very personal feelings about the issue of abortion,” Richards said. “But the vast majority of Americans believe, regardless of their personal feelings, that decisions about pregnancy are best made by women, their families, and their doctors, and not by politicians.”
Richards also discussed the social inequity gap of healthcare accessibility, citing a statistic that low-income American women are five times more likely to have an unintended pregnancy than high-income women.
“That’s the injustice of these laws,” Richards said. “It’s low-income women, and women with the least access to care, that are in the worst shape.”
During the question and answer session, audience members affiliated with the student organization Harvard Right to Life challenged Richards’ arguments.
When Scott Ely ’18, an audience member and treasurer of Harvard Right to Life, questioned the morality of certain motivations for abortion, Richards argued for the right of each woman to make reproductive decision without the oversight of politicians, legislators, governors, and judges.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eleven years after the formal introduction of a tenure track in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the Mathematics Department remains an outlier, with no assistant or associate professors to speak of and no promotions from within since the 1990s.
In place of a tenure track, the department has a number of Benjamin Peirce fellowships, three-year postdoctoral appointments that carry the status of assistant professor, but are not on the tenure track. With an eye to the department’s lack of gender diversity, FAS administrators have advocated for tenure-track hires, who tend to be more diverse.
Mathematics faculty members, though, have defended their department’s hiring practices, arguing that while diversity is a top priority, characteristics of their field make instituting a tenure track impractical.
“The simple explanation for our policy is that it works well,” former Dean of the College and now-retired Mathematics professor Benedict H. Gross ’71 wrote in an email. “We get outstanding applicants for our postdoctoral positions, who go on to tenure-track positions elsewhere. And because of the nature of the field, we usually make tenure offers to people in their late twenties or early thirties.”
According to Mathematics department chair Peter B. Kronheimer, talent in mathematics is identifiable at a young age, meaning that top candidates for tenure are typically ones who have already made a mark in their field as a postdoctoral fellow.
“We are a department where our likely candidates for tenure will almost always have had a breakthrough result early in their career, and where a tenure-track position as assistant professor is already a non-competitive offer,” he said.
He said it would be difficult for the department to find good candidates for tenure-track positions, arguing that it would be unlikely to find someone who had not yet achieved a breakthrough but would ultimately rise to the same level of achievement as tenure-worthy candidates.
Kronheimer also argued that departments at peer institutions have positions similar to the Benjamin Peirce Fellows and that, when departments have tenure tracks, they are not large enough to contribute in any significant way to the body of tenured professors.
Other leading departments—including those at MIT, Stanford, and the University of California at Berkeley—do have tenure tracks, though they vary in size. Berkeley’s Mathematics department currently has “five or six” assistant professors, according to interim chair L. Craig Evans, and Stanford’s has just two with another joining in the fall, according to its department chair Brian White. It is common for those on the tenure track to be promoted to tenure positions at their respective departments, Evans and White said.
MIT's mathematics department has 13 assistant and associate professors, though its department has almost three times the number of tenure positions that Harvard has, according to the  department chair, Tomasz S. Mrowka.
DIVERSITY AND THE TENURE TRACK 
Just a few decades ago, the Harvard Mathematics Department’s policy was the norm, rather than an exception. From roughly 1970 to 2000, FAS often—and in some departments exclusively—hired its senior faculty from outside the University, according to William C. Kirby, who as FAS Dean helped establish the tenure track in 2005.
“Math was not alone in this regard—they may have been alone in formalizing it, but they were not alone in disregarding the prospect for tenure,” Kirby said. “In those decades there was—especially in the humanities and softer social sciences at Harvard—great resistance to promotion from within.”
Yet that attitude, Kirby said, has changed dramatically in most departments in the last decade. Since 2005, assistant and associate professorships within FAS have been tenure-track positions, and the school has increasingly made an effort to find and cultivate talent at the tenure-track level. Part of the increasing emphasis on internal promotion has come from a realization that for many academics—particularly those with spouses teaching at other institutions—moving, even to Harvard, is not as easy or attractive a proposition as it used to be.
“The days when Harvard could offer somebody a tenured position here, and wherever else they were in the world they would sort of drop everything and move to Harvard—those days have gone,” Jeremy Bloxham, the dean of the FAS Science division,  said. “And now to attract the best talent we’ve got to be finding people before they’re so entrenched in another institution that they become effectively unmovable.”
Bloxham said  tenure track also aimed to diversify FAS, both in terms of attracting younger talent and in bringing women and minorities into the top ranks of higher education. Faculty members and FAS administrators have decried the high attrition rates of tenure-track women from Harvard’s flagship school.
“So in terms of one of the aims of having tenure-track faculty being to bring in young blood, younger people, onto the faculty, [the Math Department is] succeeding in that regard,” Bloxham said, referencing the Benjamin Peirce fellowships. “Now, the more serious issue is are they succeeding in terms of helping us meet our goals for having a more diverse faculty in other ways—and clearly right now the evidence suggests they’re not.”
Given that the pool of tenure-track candidates is typically more diverse than those for non-tenured positions, Bloxham said he would “like nothing more than [for] the Math Department to have a search next year at the tenure-track level.”
The Mathematics Department currently has no senior female faculty, a fact that Dean of Faculty Affairs and Planning Nina Zipser and College undergraduates expressed concern about at a town hall last month.
The department had hired its first female full professor—Sophie Morel—in 2009, though she left for Princeton soon after. At the town hall, Zipser said Harvard had offered tenured professorships to two women, including Stanford’s Maryam Mirzakhani, the first female recipient of the Fields Medal, one of the most prestigious awards in mathematics.
Kronheimer said the department as a whole views diversity as a high priority, but said it was not clear that a diverse tenure track would translate into a diverse body of senior faculty.
He argued it would be “unlikely that we would find distinguished candidates who would increase our diversity who we can appoint at the assistant professor level now and then tenure.” Kronheimer added that the department has periodically discussed the possibility of adopting a tenure track but has no plans to do so at the moment.
Bloxham said that while talent at the pure end of mathematics—where Harvard’s department, he said, resides—is usually identifiable at a young age, the department could plausibly find competitive candidates for tenure-track positions if it moved closer towards the applied end of the spectrum.
This shift may indeed happen, Bloxham predicted, with the recently established Center for Mathematical Sciences and Applications in FAS. He added that the tenure track for the Mathematics department need not last the full eight years typical at other departments. If two years into the tenure track an assistant professor made a breakthrough and had received a tenure offer from Stanford, for instance, Harvard would certainly respond in kind.
“So it’s not that once one’s on a tenure track one’s got to let a clock tick all the way until the end,” Bloxham said. “We will react when we need to—we’re not going to let our best tenure-track faculty get poached away from us.”
He added that, though the Mathematics Department might currently be uneasy with the prospect of a tenure track, he was confident that it would adapt to it in due course—just like all other FAS departments had in the years following 2005.
“I think for the Math Department, for the department itself, the idea of contemplating tenure track appointments is something they’re not entirely comfortable with yet, but I think they will go through a process of adaptation and will find that in some areas it works just fine for them,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 29, 2016, at 1:29 a.m.
When a Harvard Law School student asked a visiting Israeli dignitary why she was “smelly” at a public event, it generated widespread controversy and renewed an intense debate over free speech on campus.
The student—whose name was initially concealed, but has since been identified as third-year Palestinian Law student Husam El-Qoulaq—directed the question to former Israeli foreign minister Tzipi Livni at an event on April 14. Many called the remark anti-Semitic, and it provoked swift condemnation by Law School Dean Martha L. Minow, the Jewish Law Students Association, the president of the Middle East Law Students Association, Israeli publications, and Jewish affinity groups at the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard Business School.
El-Qoulaq said his words were not intended to be anti-Semitic. “It just felt very surreal watching people in that room treat her [Livni] as an authority on peace. The conversation had already gotten so absurd, I figured I would just add a little of my own nonsense,” he said. “I obviously regret it. I had no idea my words could be interpreted the way they have.”
He published an anonymous apology in the Harvard Law Record, and several Jewish students and alumni later penned a letter in his defense. But discussion of the incident did not end there—it had already sparked a robust debate about accountability and free speech.
The Record initially refrained from publishing El-Qoulaq’s name, and removed comments identifying him. Law School administrators also declined to share his name, citing “privacy considerations,” and edited his comment out of a video of the event the event’s hosts posted online.
Still, the Record received a flurry of online criticism for its decision to grant anonymity, including letters to the editor by alumni, demanding that it publish the student’s name so he could be held accountable. Administrators, meanwhile, faced criticism from students for removing the offending clip from the video.
“The administration making a decision to edit it out… sets a bad precedent,” second-year Law student Brandon A. Levey said. “We can have a discussion about what the comment meant, actions that should be taken, but editing it out shows that the administration doesn’t trust us to take responsibility for our actions.”
After online comments repeatedly referred to El-Qoulaq by name, El-Qoulaq decided to allow the Record to publish his identity. Discussions about consequences he should face and how administrators should respond reinvigorated broader arguments about free speech on campus and whether speech deemed offensive deserves protection.
The debate came to a head in early April, when activists with the group Reclaim Harvard Law confronted dissenting student William H. Barlow over his right to put up posters denouncing their movement in the Caspersen Center student lounge. Administrators affirmed Barlow’s right to do so, and designated the lounge as a de facto “free speech zone” where all students could express their views.
El-Qoulaq’s comment, however, has generated more vocal backlash than Barlow’s posters did. “It is hate speech. It is offensive. It is wrong,” members of the Jewish Law Students Association wrote of the remark. “A statement like this denigrates our school and our shared purpose, and we as a community cannot tolerate it.”
Some alumni publicly called for disciplinary measures against El-Qoulaq, and one suggested that the school prohibit him from attending commencement.
El-Qoulaq said administrators told him he would not face disciplinary measures. Administrators declined to comment on whether they would pursue disciplinary action as a matter of policy.
In a message to Law School affiliates last week, Minow condemned El-Qoulaq’s remark as “offensive” while affirming freedom of speech. “The fact that speech is and should be free does not mean that hateful remarks should go unacknowledged or unanswered in a community dedicated to thoughtful discussion of complex issues and questions,” she wrote.
Administrators do, however, perceive a difference between his comment and Barlow’s poster campaign. “The distinction between posting a sign in a lounge (comparing student activists to a presidential candidate) and using an anti-Semitic refrain to disrupt a public academic event seems clear,” Law School Spokesperson Robb London wrote in an email.
Master of Law student Kristen Zornada, however, said she thought Minow’s denunciation highlighted a double standard inherent in administrators’ stance on acceptable speech at the school.
“On the one hand they’re saying free speech, respect for other people’s views no matter how they choose to express it, but if someone is going to express themselves in a way that is stupid or offensive, then they should be condemned,” Zornada said. “The administrators did not seem to react that way to Bill Barlow. Why is it only now that free speech is modulated?”
During the poster controversy, Barlow and El-Qoulaq were members of opposing camps. Despite that fact, Barlow said as a “free speech absolutist,” he believes El-Qoulaq should have the right to make his comment to Livni without fear of administrative penalty.
“It’s very hard to draw the line between hate speech and unpopular speech,” Barlow said. “If you want to say something publicly even if that’s offensive to people, that’s your right.”
In the midst of these debates and initial confusion surrounding El-Qoulaq’s identity, Muslim students at the Law School have received personal threats online, in what Zornada characterized as a “huge wave of Islamophobia and anti-Arab sentiment.”
In a message to students Tuesday evening, Dean of Students Marcia L. Sells appealed to students’ civility, and characterized some of the online comments directed toward Muslim students as “cyber-bullying” and “bigotry.” She wrote that the comments, El-Qoulaq's remark, posed “profound challenges to our sense of community.”
Administrators are in contact with students who have received threatening messages, according to London, and they have helped students protect their identities and personal information online.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: 
CORRECTION: April 29 2016
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that Kristen Zornada was a third-year Law student. In fact, she is enrolled in the Masters of Law program, which lasts one year.

When Ph.D. student Hugo Vega-Ramirez first considered dropping out of graduate school, his motivation to soldier on came from an unlikely place: a pig farm in West Virginia.
Vega-Ramirez, the son of Mexican immigrants, traded his neuroscience lab for the open road. He decided to embark on a cross-country road trip with his boyfriend en route to his hometown in California, stopping at a network of farms and exchanging labor for food and shelter. The rigor of his second year in Harvard’s neuroscience doctoral program, coupled with immense feelings of isolation and homesickness, led him to take nine months off school.
Vega-Ramirez said he was inspired by the farmers he met across the country who were devoted to their work and felt they were carrying out their calling. He returned to Harvard the following spring feeling refreshed and ready to research again in his lab.
“My time off really helped me do away with all that noise in my head about feelings of incompetence, or not feeling like I really should be here, or that I was here because I’m Mexican,” Vega-Ramirez said.
His experience is not uncommon for minority students seeking Ph.D.s. While a high percentage of all Ph.D. candidates at the national level drop out of graduate school, attrition rates among underrepresented minority students are generally even higher. Thirty-six percent of underrepresented minority students—defined by the Council of Graduate Schools, a graduate education research organization, as African-Americans, American Indians/Alaskan Natives, and Hispanics—drop out of their programs, while 20 percent have not completed their degree after seven years.
At Harvard’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, minority students are few in number. Eight percent of GSAS students are underrepresented minorities, according to the school’s Associate Dean for Academic Programs and Diversity Sheila Thomas. That figure includes African Americans, Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans—a narrower definition of Hispanic—and American Indians/Alaskan Natives. Eleven percent of the newly-admitted GSAS candidates are underrepresented minorities, according to Thomas.
But while underrepresented minorities represent a small percentage of GSAS—and those who are here often struggle to stay afloat—administrators and individual departments are actively seeking to bolster their numbers and experience at Harvard.
HOME AT HARVARD?
After Vega-Ramirez moved from California to Cambridge to begin his first year at Harvard, he began missing home and felt overwhelmed with work, as though he could not keep up with the pace of both the city and the school. He withdrew from his peers and said he found it hard to form friendships that first year.
“The way I dealt with it was to try to do it all by myself,” Vega-Ramirez said. “I was like, ‘if I open up to somebody, I’m going to sound ridiculous.’”
Many minority students see their first glimpse of life at GSAS at a visiting weekend hosted specifically for minority students. In fact, Ph.D. student Sergine Brutus, a Haitian immigrant, said that weekend alone “solidified” her decision to choose Harvard. She remembers spending time with passionate, minority students, and feeling like she belonged.
But once students move to campus in the fall, that rosy picture of life as a graduate student can fade. Some minority students enrolled in Harvard’s doctoral programs said because they were few in number and seemed to lack a strong support system, they soon began grappling with the same feelings Vega-Ramirez experienced.
“It was like a culture shock,” Ph.D. student Karina N. Gonzalez Herrera said, who spoke of the “gap” she felt socially and academically after coming to Harvard from a small state school in California to study Biological and Biomedical Sciences. “I felt more comfortable with other people who were like me or similar to me.”
Many students said they felt more comfortable reaching out to peers, rather than professors, to seek help, but said they would have found it easier to open up to a minority faculty member.
“[They] sort of understand you’re struggling in a different kind of way,” Ph.D. student Khytie K. Brown said, referring to minority faculty members, many of whom experienced the same struggles as current graduate students. “Or when they do see potential, they almost feel like it’s more of their duty to respond to that.”
Vega-Ramirez said that when he eventually reached out to his classmates for support, he found that some also shared his feelings of self-doubt and inadequacy, which he calls “imposter syndrome.” Such feelings can be amplified in minority students who, like Vega-Ramirez, are the first in their families to attend college, let alone graduate school.
When Gonzalez struggled to find a community of Latino students her first year, she decided to create her own. She said she noticed that there was no minority organization for science students, and worked with Thomas, the dean for diversity, to restart the then-defunct Minority Biomedical Scientists of Harvard.
GSAS has several other student-led cultural groups in Cambridge, including the W.E.B. Du Bois Society, an umbrella organization for all minority students that is also open to students of every background.
Brown, who sits on the steering committee for the Du Bois Society, said although the group provides a much-needed space for minority students, she “wouldn’t say it’s a community.” She added leaders are attempting to rebrand the group, as its name often incorrectly signifies to some students that it is solely focused on African-American students.
Similarly, students began organizing a GSAS Latinx Student Association last fall, and obtained funding from the Graduate Student Council and formal recognition this semester.
Aside from cultural organizations and affinity groups, graduate students primarily find support within their department, cohort, or lab—which reflects the decentralized nature of GSAS. Psychology Ph.D. student Sa-kiera T. J. Hudson said she feels fortunate to have diverse labmates and an African-American adviser.
Aside from race, Hudson said socioeconomic status also contributes to feelings of isolation. Some of Hudson’s peers have parents who help them pay rent or take care of other financial obligations, while she helps support her family back home, she said.
“That is a burden that [Harvard] doesn’t ever see; your advisers don’t even see. It’s like, ‘well you’re just supposed to be doing your work,’ and I’m like, ‘I can’t do my work when I have to field calls from my family, or I’m giving up some of my stipend to give to my parents because they need the money,” Hudson said.
FIXING A LEAKY PIPELINE
Graduate school is not the first time underrepresented minority students experience feelings of pressure and isolation in an academic setting. These issues define what many academics call the “pipeline problem” whereby minority students progress through their educational career towards a tenure-track professorship.
When assessing rates of attrition among minority graduate students, points of divergence early within the pipeline, such as deciding one’s field of focus or deliberating on post-college plans, can make a large difference.
Parents can play an important role in those decisions because they often pressure their children to choose a field that is practical and financially secure
“A lot of black parents, particularly immigrant parents, their mentality is ‘you need to go to law school,’ ‘you need to go to med school,’” Brown, who is originally from Jamaica and studies in the African and African American Studies Department, said. “They understand that more than getting a Ph.D. in history.”
Dean for diversity Thomas said her own parents, who are Indian immigrants, had emphasized math and science education, and more importantly, the physician profession.
“Often a student coming from a community of color, you’re trying to think about ‘what can I do to help my community,’” Thomas added. “Being a physician, being a lawyer—there’s a very obvious ‘how to give back’ component.”
Some parents and students don’t even know what a Ph.D. entails, students said.
“The graduate life doesn’t make any sense to my family,” Hudson said. “Not having to explain it to people is a form of privilege that a lot of people don’t recognize—just how draining it can be when the people who are close to you, who want to give support, literally don't know what you’re doing.”
One way to combat problems with minority student attrition pursuing academic careers is to hire more underrepresented minority professors. Some students said the presence of minority faculty members allows them to imagine themselves potentially holding such a position.
“One of the things they do is to model—subtly, silently—what it is to be a professor from an underrepresented minority group,” English Department director of graduate studies Daniel G. Donoghue said.
Although the mere presence of minority professors is important, Donoghue said students and faculty need to establish a personal connection at the undergraduate level.
“What it takes is an individual professor having a particular kind of relationship with a student, and to say ‘look this is really good, you should think about graduate school.’ Sometimes students need to hear that,” he said.
Brown said it was important that she heard encouragement from a professor.
“The whole reason I ended up being a graduate student, I think since undergrad, it was having faculty of color who took special interest in me,” Brown said. “It was like ‘oh I think you’re really smart, have you ever thought about getting a Ph.D.?’”
In addition to personal faculty encouragement, programs across the country that aim to increase diversity in higher education can also open the door to graduate school. Many minority graduate students interviewed partook in such programs.
GSAS administrators, too, recognize the importance of programs that repair problems with the pipeline. Several Harvard programs allow undergraduate students interested in the sciences to stay on campus for summer research, pairing them with Ph.D. students and professors for informal mentoring. Harvard offers a similar program for students interested in the humanities and social sciences.
Additionally, GSAS created post-baccalaureate programs open to non-Harvard students as an effort to get more minority students to pursue a Ph.D.
“We cannot see this as, if a student doesn’t come to Harvard, that this is a failure,” Thomas said. “It’s about changing the whole national landscape, not just Harvard’s landscape.”
WIDENING THE POOL
As GSAS focuses more on ways to increase diversity within its Ph.D. programs, administrators and faculty increasingly place emphasis on holistic evaluation in the admissions process.
Each of the 56 departments admits candidates separately. Many departments, including History and Philosophy, require two members of their admissions committees to read minority student applications, “so there’s no possibility that any minority candidate can be missed,” History Department chair David R. Armitage said.
This year, of the 21 students the History Department accepted, five are underrepresented minorities, the highest in the last decade, Armitage said. He added that the quality of the incoming class is just as high as always, and that no “special reservations” were made for any candidates.
Although the departments fully scrutinize every application, committees take extra care to avoid implicit biases when deliberating on minority student applications.
“You figure, ok, where do you want to spend that extra effort?” Philosophy Department chair Edward J. Hall said. “And given that we think it’s a priority to get more underrepresented minorities into Philosophy, and into positions of professional prominence, because that can only help with the pipeline issue down the line, it seems like a good idea to spend the extra effort on that pool.”
But that pool is often very small, particularly within humanities fields, so departments have altered their admissions processes to expand the numbers. For the first time this admissions cycle, Donoghue worked with other humanities departments—namely African and African American Studies, American Studies, Comparative Literature, and Romance Languages— to share applications of underrepresented minorities who were not selected for the program to which they applied, but who may find a fit within a different humanities department.
Donoghue said graduate students prompted the initiative by calling on faculty to increase the diversity in the English Department.
“I can’t say ‘oh, we would have done this anyway if the graduate students hadn’t said what they said,’ but it’s also the case that the graduate students weren’t talking to a group that really needed a lot of convincing,” Donoghue said. “There was a general meeting of minds here.”
Donoghue added that this process of sharing applications could be expanded to include non-minority students.
Once the admissions cycle is complete, departments must also work to convince minority students to accept Harvard’s offer. This year, professors personally reached out to students to sell them on the English Department. For example, University professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. called the three African-American students admitted to the English Department to offer his personal congratulations and encourage them to attend Harvard in the fall. All three accepted their offer.
“That was a very crucial and even touching moment for these students, to have somebody with his stature to reach out to them,” Donoghue said.
Still, some departments have found it difficult to enhance diversity. The Philosophy Department has not only struggled with attracting women. Hall said he considers Philosophy “hands down the worst of the humanities” for gender diversity.
This year, Philosophy's first-year class of six students includes two underrepresented minority students—an African-American and a black student from England—which Hall called “unusual” for the department.
“Who knows if this is just a local blip, but I think we like to think it’s partly because of recent efforts and outreach,” Hall said.
Some students say they think Economics, a field that across the country generally struggles to attract minorities, is not an adequately diverse department. Eleven percent of admitted students this year were underrepresented minorities, compared to about 24 percent in the History Department.
Economics Department chair David I. Laibson ’88 said he has had conversations with Mahzarin R. Banaji, a Psychology professor who studies the effect of implicit bias, about how to search broadly for faculty members. The department applies those conversations to its graduate admissions process, he said.
After a strong pool of minority applicants are accepted and decide to come to Harvard, many recognize the impact their presence has on undergraduates considering an advanced degree.
“Being a black student in Psychology, I’ve had research assistants come up to me and go like, ‘Hi! I want to do work with you. I think the work that you do is cool, but also, I don’t see too many black people as graduate students willing to take on RAs,” Hudson said.
Hudson took it upon herself to hold weekly lab meetings with her minority research assistants, where she discusses graduate school and why they might want to pursue a Ph.D. Two of her former research assistants are now in Ph.D. programs at Cornell and Tufts, she said.
Brutus also spoke of giving back to aspiring academics, saying that minority students who are among the only ones in their programs should understand their role as a “conduit for someone in the future.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its last conference match of the season, with a potential NCAA tournament berth on the line, the Harvard men’s tennis team suffered a tough 4-1 loss to No. 38 Dartmouth (18-8, 6-1).
The lone highlight of the day for the Crimson (16-11, 4-3) came from freshman Andy Zhou. Playing at fifth singles, the California native cruised to a 6-2, 6-0 defeat of his Big Green opponent. In this way, he ended the season on a high note, boasting a five-match winning streak and a team-best 17-11 record.
Not bad for a rookie.
“It was a really bittersweet result for me,” Zhou said. “I was just trying to focus on controlling what I could control. I could see up and down the courts that people weren’t doing that well, but I just told myself to focus on the ball and play the guy across from me.”
And so he did. Equipped with his strong mental focus, Zhou earned the victory despite the four losses around him.
Even so, the freshman remained modest about his success on the team.
“Getting to that zone and that stage in athletic performance definitely takes a little bit of luck,” Zhou said. “I was fortunate. Being from California, we didn’t play indoors, so that definitely showed in the result.”
Zhou’s consistency on the court, indoors and outdoors, has been an asset to the team this year. Co-captain Nicky Hu, who is also from California and played for Zhou’s rival high school, has known and trained with Zhou for four years now.
“The one thing that really stands out about Andy is that he’s driven to win every single point, every single time he gets out on the court,” Hu said. “I’m sure it has to do with me beating up on him when he was a lot younger and less developed…. [Now] he wants to win every single time he steps on the court.”
As a whole, the team struggled to clinch doubles points earlier in the season, making each singles point count for that much more. Despite the pressurized situation, Zhou consistently pulled through in contested matches to boost Harvard and pave the way for critical wins.
In January, for instance, Zhou fought for a key victory in the Crimson’s 4-3 triumph over William & Mary. Subsequently he went on to crush his Boston College opponent that same day, playing at first singles. It was a case of two impressive results stuffed into an intense 24-hour period.
But even after one year with the program, teammates said that they trusted Zhou to get the job done in crunch-time situations
“You can rely on him out there on the courts because you know he’s never going to let up mentally,” Hu said. “He’s never going to get off course and talk himself into a hole because he only has one goal in mind, and that really fuels him when he’s playing.”
That double-header performance was no one-time feat. In March, he defeated his Old Dominion opponent to help Harvard earn a 4-3 win over the Monarchs. Then he continued to claim claiming victory a few hours later, squaring off again at first singles against Amherst.
Zhou has matured a great deal to reach this point. As he described it, his former high school self used a much different style of play—one that was scrappier, more aggressive, and more reactive. These days, he has changed his ways, running a lot less and dictateing play a lot more. Given the physical demands of a college tennis schedule, this strategic change comes at an important time.
Hu has had a special perspective on this improvement. From watching Zhou the California youngster to Zhou the burgeoning college star, the co-captain has been able to spectate and marvel at the whole trajectory of development.
“Only [in] his junior and senior year in high school did he really come into himself as a player,” Hu said. “Every time I went back for winter break or summer break, you could see him making vast strides in his game. Overall, he’s a much more offensive player, and his bigger serve and bigger groundstrokes have really complimented that.”
As the team graduates three seniors this year—all crucial players for the Crimson— Zhou will return in the fall with big shoes to fill as an older and more experienced member of the program.
But if his past improvement is any indication for future play, then Zhou appears to be up for the challenges ahead of him.
“I’m really looking forward to having a productive summer, returning to the courts in the fall, being one of the older guys on the team and having a little more experience under my belt,” Zhou said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off a three-game losing streak, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team was in dire need of a win.
As it turned out, the team ended up getting the victory with relative ease.
Facing off against non-conference rival UMass Lowell (1-16, 0-6 AEC) in Lowell, Mass. on Tuesday night, the Crimson (8-6, 3-3 Ivy) rode a dominant first-half performance to a 12–5 victory, picking up some much-needed momentum along the way.
“I think morale was pretty high headed into the game,” said co-captain and midfielder Audrey Todd. “Midweek games under the lights are always fun, so everyone was excited to get out onto the field. That definitely helped our performance because we started the game with a ton of energy and fight.”
Although the final margin was definitive, Harvard struggled in the second half behind a less aggressive display from the offense and an anemic showing from its defense. This combination led to a more stressful final period, as the River Hawks outscored the Crimson 5-2 over the final 30 minutes and reinvigorated a game that had appeared moribund.
But ultimately Harvard’s authoritative play in the first stanza was enough to withsand the rally and carry the visiting team to victory over its one-win opponents.
In the opening half, the Crimson outshone its opponent in nearly every category, winning eight of 11 draw controls, going 10-for-10 in clear attempts, and firing 21 shots on goal compared to one by UMass Lowell. When the whistle blew at the end of the first period, Harvard had tallied 10 goals and completely shut out the River Hawks.
Racking up two scores and four assists, junior attacker Marissa Romeo had a heavy hand in helping the Crimson swiftly establish its 10-0 lead over UMass Lowell in the first half. Senior midfielder Alexis Nicolia also tallied two scores and one assist of her own in the opening period, and the pair scored or set up eight of Harvard’s first 10 goals to put the result seemingly out of reach.
Although Romeo and Nicolia played a critical role in the win, 10 different teammates found the back of the net on the night in a team-wide effort.
Harvard’s first goal came from a rookie, as freshman midfielder Ali Thaler opened up the scoring less than five minutes into play, quickly followed by tallies from junior attacker Maeve McMahon and sophomore midfielder Nekele McCall.
Romeo and Nicolia each put away a brace before sophomore attacker Caroline Ashford, Todd, and freshman attacker Nicole Baiocco each chipped in a goal to stretch the Crimson’s lead to 10.
“It was an overall team win today,” said co-captain and goalie Kelly Weis. “Romeo was able to stay in and work the offense, and we were able to rotate some kids in…. [It] was great to have everyone contribute.”
Despite holding a 10-goal advantage heading into intermission, Harvard faltered in the second act. After UMass Lowell had held the Crimson scoreless for nearly 10 minutes of play, River Hawks sophomore midfielder Kaylan DiModugno scored her team’s first goal of the afternoon at 20:53 in the second half.
That finish set off a 5-0 run at Harvard’s expense, a period during which the once-potent attack unit went completely quiet.
Sparked by DiModugno’s finish, UMass Lowell scored four unanswered goals on the Crimson in the final 10 minutes of play to narrow Harvard’s advantage to five, but the comeback bid ultimately fell short.
“I have to credit UMass Lowell for applying more pressure defensively in the second half, but I think we did a good job of handling it and stifling their comeback,” Todd said. “It was a good fight.”
Harvard finally regained its footing in the final two minutes of the contest, as freshman midfielder Caroline Garrity and sophomore attacker Eliza Guild each collected a goal to end the River Hawks’ scoring run. These scores steadied the visitors and secured the win for a Harvard squad in serious need of good news.
“We were working on some different things offensively so we slowed down on shooting,” Weis said. “A couple of things went their way, and as a team UML never backed down. They are a gritty team that will never go away given the chance to come back.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Saturday, on a breezy and sun-dappled evening, football returned to Harvard Stadium.
Field lights glared, turf pellets sprayed, assistant coaches barked, and on the field, next year’s Crimson roster split into two teams to compete in the annual spring game.
The scrimmage marked the end of offseason practices, a months-long regimen that forces players to wake up early for weightlifting and football drills. With this stage over, Harvard will not reconvene until August, when the program opens training camp.
Saturday’s contest was technically a competition among friends, but it bore many of the markings of a serious game. Full-contact hits echoed around the stadium, and a crowd of local spectators, soon-to-graduate players, and high school junior recruits and their parents filled the stands.
However, various clues indicated the informality of the affair. Quarterbacks donned green non-contact jerseys, and half the special teamers wore orange helmet covers.
Scoreboard duties fell to a pair of injured team members, who played loose with the timing and points. (Since the spring game truly pits  offense against defense, the operators decided to score the game that way. As one watcher wryly noted, this arrangement made it rather difficult for defense to win.)
In any case, Harvard football claimed victory after three quarters, with a final score of Crimson 13, White 7.
More important than the result, however, were the storylines that the game revealed.
Starting at quarterback: a mystery
Junior Joe Viviano, the presumed starting quarterback next year, remains an enigma.
Last fall, Viviano battled senior Scott Hosch for the starting role. The competition appeared fierce until Viviano broke his left foot, which not only ended his season but also kyboshed any spectator hopes of getting a glimpse of Harvard’s future.
Next season, Viviano likely has a grip on the starter’s job, but the spring game gave no indication of that. Sidelined by an undisclosed injury, the junior watched the game in sneakers, shorts, and a jersey.
The two quarterbacks on the field were a pair of freshmen: 6’6” Cam Tripp and 6’2” Tom Stewart. Both put up impressive statistics, with Tripp going 8-for-11 for 89 yards and Stewart going 9-of-16 for 136 yards.
Despite similar output, Tripp and Stewart displayed different styles of play. Stewart, a Texas native, showed bursts of speed and led all rushers with 77 yards on eight carries. The lankier Tripp seemed less comfortable on the run but had good zip on his throws.
While Stewart played with the first-team offense, the backup job will likely remain up for grabs until preseason camp, if not later.
New linebacker trio anchors the defense
Last year the undisputed heart of the team lay in the linebacker core, where seniors Matt Koran, Jacob Lindsey, and Eric Medes played virtually every meaningful snap. Against Dartmouth, it was this unit that forced a game-changing fumble late in the fourth quarter, and all three players earned first- or second-team honors in the Ivy League.
Next year Koran, Lindsey, and Medes will all be gone. In their place will step roughly 600 pounds of new muscle: junior Eric Ryan, sophomore Luke Hutton, and sophomore Chase Guillory.
Last Saturday, Ryan filled the middle linebacker role, and the sophomores flanked on either side. Similarly to last year, the plan appeared to be to keep the trio together as much as possible to facilitate the kind of mutual instincts that distinguished Koran, Lindsey, and Medes.
Ryan, Guillory, and Hutton all saw some action last year, with Guillory and Ryan playing in every game. But many of these snaps came in less pressurized situations, when coach Tim Murphy elected to give the seniors a breather.
Shakeup in the offensive line 
Throughout their time at Harvard, offensive linemen Anthony Fabiano, Cole Toner, and Adam Redmond specialized in creating big holes. A month from now, when they leave campus after graduation, they’ll create the biggest hole yet.
Just as linebackers anchored last year’s defense, offensive linemen anchored last year’s offense. Two starters—sophomore Larry Allen, Jr. and junior Max Rich—return after making the Ancient Eight second team last year. But the departure of Fabiano, Redmond, and Toner, who is an NFL prospect, hurts in a major way.
Consequently one of the most pressing questions facing next year’s team is whether it can reload such a depleted unit.
Last Saturday’s game provided little clarity. Barring remarkable dominance or ineptitude, it’s generally difficult to judge an offensive line on three quarters of play.
In other words, stay in your seat: Questions surrounding the offensive line won’t find an answer until next fall, when a fresh set of large men lines up for week one.
Buy your Firkser jerseys now
It’s relatively easy to go overlooked in a unit that contains a breakout freshman star, a fourth-round NFL prospect, and a senior duo nicknamed Thing One and Thing Two.
But last year, facing this level of competition from freshman receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley, senior tight end Ben Braunecker, and senior wide receivers Seitu Smith and Andrew Fischer, Anthony Firkser still got his touches. In six of his nine games, he reached 40 yards, including a two-touchdown performance against Penn.
Many of his teammates may be graduating, but last Saturday, Firkser made clear that he is here to stay. He led all receivers with 87 yards on three grabs and caught the first score of the night on a 17-yard slant.
Certainly, next year’s receiving corps extends beyond Firkser. Shelton-Mosley, who racked up 589 receiving yards and six touchdowns, is back again, as is junior Joseph Foster and sophomore Jack Stansell.
But Murphy has consistently found a way to utilize wide-outs like Firkser with good hands and big frames. If Saturday is any indication, the junior is primed for a big season.
An exclamation point and a question mark for special teams 
The good news is that the Crimson still knows how to block a kick.
The spring game ended this way, with the defense pushing through the line to smother an extra point. Murphy whirled his hands in the sky, and both teams raced to the locker room.
Earlier in the game, Harvard had also burst through for a would-be blocked punt—except, given the informal nature of the game, punter Zach Schmid held onto the ball and booted a second later.
That special-teams stinginess recalled last season, when Harvard finished third in the nation in blocked punts (five) and fifth in in blocked kicks (seven).
The bad news is the other side of the equation: Punter Zach Schmid and kicker Kenny Smart still inspire uncertainty in the hearts of Crimson fans.
There were no slip-ups last Saturday, as Schmid uncorked a few line-drive punts and Smart nailed extra points and two short field goals. Nor were there acts of brilliance.
All too often last year, shaky kicking hurt Harvard. It remains to be seen whether an additional year of experience and practice will make a difference for Smart and Schmid.
