After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 2018 Grammy Awards have already been controversial. For the first time since 1999, not a single white man was nominated for Album of the Year. What’s more, rumor has it that Beyoncé fans still have not forgiven the Academy for bestowing Adele the Album of the Year award over Beyoncé’s “Lemonade.”
The music industry raised the bar this past year. Most of the nominated artists produced some of their best work, resulting in a fiercely competitive year—just in time for the Grammys’ 60th year milestone. With the show fast approaching, let’s break down some of the nominations and see how many of the categories the Academy’s voting members will get wrong, yet again.
Album of the Year Nominees:
“Awaken, My Love!” by Childish Gambino
“4:44” by Jay-Z
“DAMN.” by Kendrick Lamar
“Melodrama” by Lorde
“24K Magic” by Bruno Mars
What should win: “DAMN.”
We might have given “DAMN.” a mere two stars when we reviewed it, but the album has both the artistic merit and the cultural significance to win the award. Standout songs “HUMBLE.” and “LOYALTY.” reveal a refreshingly poppy side of Lamar, while future classics “DNA.” and “DUCKWORTH.” remind listeners why the wordsmith’s ability to storytell remains his biggest strength.
What will win: “4:44.”
Like his wife, Jay-Z has never won the Grammy’s top prize. Though the album is exclusively on Tidal, Jay-Z’s streaming company, which undoubtedly hindered “4:44’s” commercial success compared to his younger counterparts. Nevertheless, this album is Jay-Z’s most revealing, honest, and self-critical work. His long standing reputation and staying power make him the obvious choice to win.
Record of the Year Nominees:
“Redbone” by Childish Gambino
“Despacito” by Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee Featuring Justin Bieber
“The Story of O.J.” by Jay-Z
“HUMBLE.” by Kendrick Lamar
“24K Magic” by Bruno Mars
What should win: “Redbone.”
By far the highlight of “Awaken, My Love!,” “Redbone” is a modern twist on the psychedelic funk that inspired it. The best produced record of this list, “Redbone” is a refreshing take on infidelity and relationships, a trope overused in every genre. But while the record echoes calls for action and awareness—”Stay woke,” croons Childish Gambino in the chorus—that are characteristic of the activist movements dominating our social climate, “Redbone” might ultimately not have had the cultural impact typical of the records that usually win this category, peaking at number twelve on the charts in August.
What will win: “Despacito.”
As evidenced by its record-tying sixteen weeks as the Billboard Hot 100 number one single, “Despacito” could win only for its international popularity and success. Its bilinguality would make it the first non-English song to win Record of the Year, an achievement that would be in line with what is sure to be the celebratory nature of the 60th annual Grammy awards.
Song of the Year Nominees:
“Despacito” by Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee featuring Justin Bieber
“4:44” by Jay-Z
“Issues” by Julia Michaels
“1-800-273-8255” by Logic featuring Alessia Cara & Khalid
“That’s What I Like” by Bruno Mars
What should and will win: “Despacito.”
Whether or not it wins Record of the Year, “Despacito” is a shoe-in for Song of the Year. This Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee, and Justin Bieber collaboration combines a mix of cultures, languages, and music styles with an irresistible dance beat that kept listeners dancing all year long.
Best Pop Vocal Album Nominees:
“Kaleidoscope EP” by Coldplay
“Lust For Life” by Lana Del Rey
“Evolve” by Imagine Dragons
“Rainbow” by Kesha
“Joanne” by Lady Gaga
“÷ (Divide)” by Ed Sheeran
What should win: “Rainbow.”
In her third studio album, Kesha redefined herself not just as a singer, but as an artist. This album is the first she’s recorded without having to work with Dr Luke, the producer she’s accused of sexual abuse. In a time when Hollywood is undergoing long overdue changes to put an end to rampant and systematic sexual harassment, giving Kesha the win might send a message that the music industry also stands with those whose voices have been silenced. Some of Kesha’s relatively more popular competitors stand a better chance of winning, but no one can deny the growth and vulnerability in the pop star’s new music.
Who will win: “÷ (Divide).”
Ed Sheeran may have been shut out of the Album of the Year race, but the voting members will likely give him a win this category to make up for it. The album rides on the success of hit singles like “Shape of You” and “Castle on the Hill,” which voters will probably take for the whole of the album.
Best Urban Contemporary Album Nominees:
“Free 6LACK” by 6LACK
"Awaken, My Love!" by Childish Gambino
“American Teen” by Khalid
“Ctrl” by SZA
“Starboy” by The Weeknd
Who should and will win: “Ctrl”.
In this album, SZA pushes the boundaries of the R&B genre that “Awaken, My Love!” tried unsuccessfully to challenge. Raw and relatable, rich and unapologetically honest, the album captures the essence of SZA’s unique take on the genre. “Ctrl” is a statement album that both embraces femininity in all its forms and redefines what R&B can sound like.
Best Rap Album Nominees:
“4:44” by Jay-Z
“DAMN.” by Kendrick Lamar
“Culture” by Migos
“Laila's Wisdom” by Rapsody
“Flower Boy” by Tyler, The Creator
And the winner is… impossible to decide. What is perhaps this category’s strongest nominees in its history, the Best Rap Album’s five nominees are each deserving of their own award. Tyler, The Creator refined his voice, sharing a part of himself he previously publicly joked around with. “Culture” undeniably had a cultural (ha!) impact on the emerging sub-genre of mumble rap. “Laila’s Wisdom” reminds its audience that men aren’t the only ones who can rap, and Rapsody’s artistry evokes a purer time in Hip Hop when its music didn’t consistently depend on its consumability to thrive. As for “4:44” and “DAMN.,” well, their nominations for Album of the Year should clearly illustrate their merit of a win in this category, as well.
Tune in tonight at 7:30PM to find out just how wrong I end up being.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Most video games quickly bore me for one of two reasons. They either force me down a particular path or prove too unrealistic to enjoy. Regarding the former shortfall, too many developers pressure players to adopt certain play styles or follow a prescribed path to win. To defeat certain villains, you must use certain techniques. To unlock a certain ending, you must save certain characters in a certain order. Before long, instead of providing an escape from life’s boring procedures, most games devolve into a formulaic series  of repetitive quests that numb your mind as you replace real routines with virtual ones.
Of the few games that grant their players  sufficient freedom, the majority are too fantastical and over-the-top for my taste. Shooting space wizards is strange and impossible. Fighting to preserve the sanctity of long-lost kingdoms is about as consequential as it is realistic.  Perhaps I’m too much of a sour cynic. Regardless, if I can’t see your game occurring within our real world, chances are, I won’t enjoy it.
A few weeks ago, as I sat with some friends drinking a decent milkshake at an otherwise forgettable restaurant, I came across a favorable YouTube review of a new strategy game titled “Hearts of Iron IV.” The game, set in either 1936 or 1939, invites players to lead any state or colony of their choosing as World War II creeps closer. Do you desire to secure independence for the Dutch East Indies? Go ahead. Want to forge a Mexican empire in Central America as the United States preoccupies itself with Imperial Japan? Be my guest.
Nevertheless, what attracted me the most to Hearts of Iron IV was its difficulty. Your country isn’t afforded any of the advantages or perks granted to most game protagonists. Want to start 1936 as Thailand? You’ll boast far less factories and a much smaller army than Japan or Britain, two hungry empires who will soon come knocking at your door.  However, history isn’t destiny in Hearts of Iron IV. Armed with hindsight, you can upset the traditional balance of power. Hope to combat the rise of fascism? Send volunteers to Republican Spain to crush Franco’s forces. Do the Soviet armies massing on the Finnish border make you nervous? Create a Scandinavian defense pact to counter the Soviet Union’s numerical might. The possibility to triumph where great statesmen failed—that’s how Hearts of Iron IV conquered my heart.
Upon downloading Hearts of Iron IV, I spent hours analyzing the perks and drawbacks of each nation, thoroughly impressed by the game’s attention to detail. Before playing Hearts of Iron IV, I didn’t know that Rafael Franco was the president of Paraguay in 1936, or that the Tuvan People’s Republic was even a thing. (For the curious among you, it was a former Soviet satellite state that is now part of Russia.) However, after much mental deliberation, I decided to play as one of the game’s seven major powers: Germany.
Rather than foolishly attempt to conquer Europe single-handedly, I started my campaign at 4:00 p.m.  on a Sunday afternoon by forging alliances with various Eastern European dictators. I then developed my relationship with the Soviet Union, distancing myself from Mussolini’s overly-aggressive Italy. By 9:15 p.m., I had succeeded in diplomatically isolating France from the rest of Europe; by 10:30 p.m., Paris was mine. Following my victory, I converted my non-aggression pact with the USSR into a permanent alliance, opting to disband the Axis Powers in exchange for a stronger German-Soviet alliance. Nevertheless, I shored up my eastern defenses; the artificial intelligence program that runs Stalin isn’t known for its honesty.
At 12:23 a.m., I finally decided to sleep. However, before doing so, I pressed the “war” notification flashing on the upper right portion of my screen; to my surprise, a list of casualties appeared. My forces had lost over 500,000 soldiers during their campaigns across Western Europe; meanwhile the casualties of my adversaries numbered just over one million. Interestingly, the game ignored civilian casualties, opting to instead paint World War II as a clean battle between militaries rather than a disgusting struggle between various vicious ideologies.
Initially, I felt satisfied; I had succeeded where legendary generals like Erich von Manstein and Erwin Rommel had failed. But glancing at the casualty list left me feeling empty. As I looked at the map of “Greater Germany,” I thought of what that would have meant in real life. Antwerp and Brussels destroyed. Paris looted. Millions of refugees. Millions more left dead. After pondering things through for a minute or two, I uninstalled the game.
On its surface, Hearts of Iron IV is a great game. For the twenty or so hours I spent playing over break, I was in a state of geeky bliss. But that’s the problem. It gamifies conquest; it abstracts the suffering of war and separates military conflicts from their dark political foundations. Following my short stint with Hearts of Iron IV, I decided to abandon “realistic” video games. In their attempts to better reflect reality, these games sanitize its horrors and trivialize the suffering of our ancestors.
If you’ve ever played as an expansionist power in Hearts of Iron IV or in a similar game, I’m not calling you a cruel warlord. After all, strategy games and their lengthy lists of casualties are limited to the virtual realm. However, next time you play a game like Hearts of Iron, I want you to ask yourself whether you’d like to live as a commoner in the virtual worlds you forge.
At the end of the day, perhaps it’s best to stick to shooting space wizards after all.

I have spent countless hours exposing and writing about my own experiences. I have spent countless hours in meetings, planning actions, and sharing my story. I have chased down politicians and staked out their locations. I have sat in offices for hours hoping to share my story, hoping that it will drive those in power to stand alongside us. I have marched in the frigid cold and overwhelming heat with my undocumented community, fighting for our voices to be heard.
My community has put the little we have on the line. We have risked deportation as part of our daily existence and constantly fear the separation of our families. We have been outspoken after being quiet so long for fear of retaliation. We have been persistent. We have continued living our lives as best we can despite all the people who tell us that our existence is wrong, that we are illegal. My people have thrived. We have thrived in the face of obstacles unimaginable by the people who hold our fates in their hands. We have thrived through border crossings and exploitation. We have thrived through detention and deportation. We have thrived through wage theft and abuse. We have shouted at the top of our lungs while tears flowed uncontrollably down our cheeks.We have been criminalized to the point where our humanity has come into question. My community has been reduced to statistics on our economic worth. We have been reduced to people who can only provide physical labor and then told to leave for stealing jobs. We have been employed by the same people who want to deport us. We have been called lazy in one sentence and job-stealers in the next.We are forced to prove our humanity in the midst of xenophobic rhetoric. We compete with the framing of immigrants presented by politicians through the media they dominate. We take action and protest to reclaim the power that’s been taken from us. We make our struggles public to gain attention for our real narratives. We strive to tell our own truths so that those in power can’t keep getting away with telling their own lies.We have been toyed with as politicians give us empty promises in exchange for photo-ops. We have been promised unconditional support to our faces and given no solutions on paper. We have had politicians try to pin us against each other through the good-versus-bad-immigrant narrative. We have had our youth held up as examples of the only members worth saving in our community. We are given scholarships as our parents are given blame. Our community is never acknowledged in its entirety for all that it is worth. We are never seen for all the stories that we bring. We are not seen for all our different cultures, languages, and experiences. To be part of this undocumented community means to be part of a community of all different skin tones, languages, religions, gender identities, and sexualities. Instead, we are clumped together under the hateful term “illegal immigrant” and stereotyped as the Latino and the criminal. We are simultaneously separated into all these boxes because of our different backgrounds and united into this one category based on immigration status. But it is this one common identity that has managed to unite us all. Despite politicians’ constant attempts to pin us against each other, we have remained a united front against a common enemy. We have experienced so much harm against our community that we have been forced to find solace amongst ourselves somehow.We thrive because we have each other. We have gone through hell and back, but still, we thrive. We know who we are. We know our worth exceeds any statistic. We know our humanity and that of those around us. We see the beauty in our strength, our intersectionality, and our resistance. We continue because we know that we are not doing this alone.
We know that we are 11.3 million strong.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Thursday, the Hasty Pudding Theatricals announced that beginning with its 2019 production, the troupe would welcome women to audition for the first time in its nearly 200-year history. This change marks the culmination of advocacy for a more inclusive Pudding from both   within and outside of the organization.
We acknowledge the positive influence of this decision for non-male students hoping to gain the connections, experience, and exposure that the Pudding grants its cast members. Far from upending the tradition of the Pudding’s drag shows, we believe that this decision will be beneficial for all involved. We do not feel that this shift will, as former Theatricals president Robert T. Fitzpatrick ’16 suggested in 2015, mandate any “structural changes” to the production, nor will it interfere with the Pudding’s traditions. Women are more than capable of performing comedy in drag—just look at the female cast members of Saturday Night Live.
However, while we celebrate the Pudding’s decision to open the cast of next year’s production to people of all genders, we remain skeptical of this decision’s ability to truly foster a more inclusive atmosphere within the Pudding. Moreover, we would be remiss to congratulate the Pudding without recognizing that this change is long past due.
The Pudding’s refusal to accept women into its cast is not the only feature of the organization that has caused controversy or that requires re-evaluation in order to promote values of inclusivity and acceptance. The fight for inclusivity in the Pudding did not end with Thursday's announcement, and we remain critical of the sexist practices and elitist composition of the organization.
Even though the development is a step in the direction of gender equality, it does not address the issues of race and class that continue to follow the Pudding. Founded in 1844, much of the Theatricals’ elitist image stems from its association with the Hasty Pudding Club, its social arm. While the comp process for the Theatricals is separate from the punch process for the HPC, the organizations remain linked.
Of the HPC's 2013 punches, 85% had attended private high schools, compared to 39% of the Class of 2017 as a whole. Similarly, 77% of punches came from schools in the Northeast, as compared to only 41% of the entire freshman class. Though these statistics refer to the social club rather than the Theatricals, they nonetheless reflect the makeup and culture of the organization with which Theatricals members closely associate. While the decision to end gender discrimination in casting will undoubtedly help some women access the many connections and resources that Pudding productions provide, this decision will not ameliorate a culture that favors affluent Americans from Northeast prep schools.
Further,  issues of sexism in the Pudding extend beyond their casting policy alone. The Pudding’s portrayals of women often reflect demeaning, over-sexualized views of femininity. Far from using drag as a way to embrace freedom of self-expression, Pudding shows emphasize gender stereotypes, boasting characters with names such as “Donna My Knees” and “Sheila Rowsya.”
The Pudding’s new gender-inclusive policy thus stands at odds with its history of exclusivity on multiple fronts. We applaud the women who have auditioned for the Pudding in protest throughout the past three years, and we look forward to the positive influence that Thursday’s decision will have on the  organization. But if the Pudding truly wishes to be inclusive, they must do more.

Dear Editor,
I write in response to last week’s editorial, “A More Perfect Union Election,” to reaffirm the University’s commitment to advancing an open and transparent process as we look ahead to a second election on student unionization at Harvard.
On the list: Harvard has always been and continues to be committed to including all eligible student voters. A University team, across 11 schools and more than 50 degree programs, worked diligently to create the most accurate list possible prior to the November 2016 election. Despite their best efforts, many factors resulted in unintentional omissions, as described in the FAQs on the Office of the Provost website. It’s important to remember that this is new territory for Harvard and for the National Labor Relations Board, which conducted the first election. Harvard was the first private institution to hold an election following the change in law and similar issues related to voter lists have been raised at other private universities holding elections on unionization across the country.
On the November 2016 election: the University learned a lot and has taken steps to modify our processes in preparation for a second election. A clear lesson is that sufficient time is required to create the best possible list. Harvard has proposed a mid-March cut-off date for the voter list, when the majority of teaching and research appointments for the spring term will be finalized. The Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers  has countered with a mid-February date for the list cut-off—just after the add/drop deadline, when enrollments and teaching assignments are still in flux. We are continuing to discuss the schedule with the HGSU-UAW and the NLRB, and we hope they will agree that it is critically important that a comprehensive list be produced, to the best of our ability, so that the outcome of the second election will not be questioned on the basis of the completeness of the list.
And most importantly, on an open and informed discussion: as The Crimson rightly points out, there are a range of perspectives on the issue of whether student unionization makes sense here at Harvard. The University will continue to make information available on the Student Vote section of the Office of the Provost website, where links to a number of student-driven websites can be found, including the HGSU-UAW and Graduate Student Unionization: A Critical Approach websites and the Against HGSU-UAW Facebook page. The HGSU-UAW will also continue to have access to our community to share its perspective. In addition, we hope student leaders across Harvard’s schools will create opportunities on their campuses for discussions that consider all sides of this important issue. Harvard believes it is critically important that all eligible student voters consider the issues at stake, engage in a robust conversation about the potential impact of unionization, and, most importantly, cast informed votes.

Harvard’s Hasty Pudding Theatricals: men wearing women’s clothes onstage. This, by the barest textbook definition, is “drag.” But is this definition adequate? Does the Hasty Pudding deserve the title of “drag”?
They do not. Drag is not neutral. Drag without the celebration and protection of Brown and Black Queer folks is anti-Queer, anti-Brown, and anti-Black. And an organization like the Hasty Pudding Theatricals—not actively pro-Queer, pro-Brown, and pro-Black and so necessarily anti-Queer, anti-Brown, and anti-Black—never could be drag.
What is drag?
Drag’s present is irrevocably entwined with its past. Imagine, rather than the cast of the Hasty Pudding, Venus Xtravaganza, a small Latinx trans drag queen, dancing in the ballrooms of late-’80s New York. She dances because she knows the beauty of her Brown skin, her Queer body. Her dance gives her power. How else, but by dancing, can she live in a world that mercilessly crushes Brown and Black, Queer and trans bodies, crushes them under its anti-Queer, anti-Brown and anti-Black healthcare and legal system and education system and culture and police state? How else, but by dancing, can Venus Xtravaganza breathe?
Does anyone in the Hasty Pudding Theatricals even know Venus Xtravaganza’s name? If not, how can they know what drag really is?
At 23 years of age, Venus Xtravaganza is murdered. She dies unavenged. To the white world, she was nothing but another ugly dirty Brown fairy made unto dust. The 1990 film in her honor declares that “Paris is Burning,” and Venus Xtravaganza burns with it, her Brown, Queered body licked by flames, her Brown skin that you just can’t handle crackling and popping.
In her honor, in the name of Venus Xtravaganza, we promise to dance.
This is drag:
Drag (noun): The air resistance in your face as you careen into the stars, unbound by your gendered and sexed body only to return at last to it such that your return is a homecoming, your skin is the night sky.
Drag queen (noun): Those icons, those flawed humans, those astronauts who wear their Queerness as a uniform and are murdered for it because you just can’t take it!
Drag is Queer, and drag is Brown and Black. The ballroom is a battleground, and voguing—the dance of drag, our triumph—is a battle cry. Let’s have a kiki, Marsha P. Johnson, the hero of Stonewall, roars, heels strapped on tight, crushing anti-Blackness and misogyny and transphobia beneath her. Drag is political—because when is a dance ever just a dance, and when is the disruption of gender ever anything but a declaration of war?
To Mila Kunis and Paul Rudd, do you know this history? And if so, does the Hasty Pudding deserve a place in it?
First: the Hasty Pudding is not a Queer or Brown/Black organization. While many members may identify as Queer or of color, the Hasty Pudding has never been known to use its expansive budget or influence for Queer Brown folks. While the Hasty Pudding qualifies itself as philanthropic due to its donations to multiple arts groups, and while those donations may do some peripheral good for Queers of color, this is not equal to a sustained dedication to politically disrupting Queerphobia and white supremacy. When has Hasty Pudding ever donated to the hundreds of individuals and groups specifically dedicated to liberating Queer Brown folks? When has the Hasty Pudding ever stood against the murders of Jamie Lee Wounded Arrow and Chyna Gibson? Queerness and Brownness are political, and screwing with gender is political, for the structures of society are implicated in our survival. Until the Hasty Pudding tangibly disrupts racist anti-Queer and trans-deadly legal, political, economic, and social structures, it fails to be radically Queer or radically Brown.
Second: the Hasty Pudding has historically been structured to discredit and disempower womxn (“womxn” is a rejection of the simplicity of “women,” an embrace of the multiplicity of non-male identity and a way we screw with gender). Drag has never been exclusively for cisgender men. Drag is the discarding and mockery of gender, and the Hasty Pudding, in historically restricting gender performance to men, has strengthened the very systematic gender structures drag seeks to dismantle. To view the Pudding’s recent decision to let women audition as a pro-womxn victory would be a mischaracterization. There are generations of systematic exclusion of womxn to overcome, most pointedly the disproportionate possession of power by men. And, more importantly, opening this space to what seems likely to primarily be—based on current composition—rich, white women fails to address the lack of support for womxn folks from this organization.
Third: the Hasty Pudding originated from a legacy of elitism. Remember: for Venus Xtravaganza, Paris is Burning, and drag rises from the ashes of a Brown Queer declaration of war against a world that hates us. But the Hasty Pudding does not come from those ashes. Rather, it was first and foremost a “a no-holds-barred burlesque” deeply tied to the toxicity of final clubs, a wealthy, white organization steeped in privilege. Its lineage consists of the cisgender, white men John Adams and Franklin Delano Roosevelt—hardly Queer icons. These men were not racist homophobes, you may protest, but that is besides the point. Their (presumed) neutrality cannot save them.
Imagine, for a moment, a radically pro-Queer, pro-Brown, pro-womxn, gender-disrupting organization with the resources, fame, and attention of the Hasty Pudding. Imagine if a Queer ballroom replaced the Hasty Pudding's clubhouse. Imagine a parade down Massachusetts Ave. celebrating Big Freedia and Laverne Cox. Imagine the thousands of dollars in proceeds going to Black Trans Advocacy. Imagine the president of the Hasty Pudding writing a letter urging President Donald Trump to cease and desist all attacks against trans folks. Imagine the cast of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals protesting the murder of Candace  Towns. Imagine a Hasty Pudding built by and for Brown and Black folks, and one that finally admitted that womxn can screw with gender too.
Imagine a Hasty Pudding that dedicated its performances every night to Venus Xtravaganza, whose-skin-you-just-can’t-take, and the thousands of trans folks, Brown and Black and all, who have suffered so that you may strap on your heels and kiki.
And then stop imagining, and dance, darling, dance until that foolish dream is reality.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s presidential search committee recently contacted World Bank President Jim Yong Kim, who is debating the pros and cons of the University’s top job with friends and advisers, according to sources close to Kim.
Kim—who headed a Harvard Medical School department and served as president of Dartmouth before taking charge of the World Bank—is weighing whether he should accept the Harvard presidency if he is offered the job, two sources said. In some conversations with friends in the last month, Kim has said he is torn: He has plans for World Bank initiatives across the next few years but feels deep institutional ties to Harvard.
In an emailed statement Sunday, Kim wrote he is devoted to his role at the World Bank.
“I’m completely committed to my job at the World Bank Group,” Kim wrote. “And, because of my experience with Presidential searches, I know that the only people who know what’s going on in a search are the committee members and so speculation from anyone else is just that, speculation.”
“In the meantime, I will continue to work to end poverty in the world,” Kim wrote.
The presidential search committee reached out to Kim sometime after November, one source said earlier this month. The sources spoke only on the condition of anonymity to preserve their relations with Kim.
Kim, who was appointed to his current post by President Barack Obama in 2012, is seven months into his second five-year term as World Bank president.
Kim’s contact with the committee comes during the final phase of the search for Harvard’s 29th leader, begun over the summer after University President Drew G. Faust announced she plans to step down in June 2018. In December, The Crimson reported that the search committee—comprising all 12 members of the Harvard Corporation and three members of the Board of Overseers—had winnowed its pool of candidates to under 20 names.
Past search committees often spoke with experts and leaders in a variety of fields to seek their general input in the early stages of previous searches. But past committees usually began conducting hours-long interviews with finalists by January or early February.
William F. Lee ’72, the senior fellow of the Corporation who chairs the search committee, wrote in an emailed statement Sunday that the committee will not comment on possible candidates.
“The Search Committee is committed to protecting the confidentiality of the process but, more importantly, the confidentiality of any candidates,” Lee wrote.
Kim is one of four individuals Harvard Medical School Dean George Q. Daley ’82 said he “expects” to see on the search committee’s shortlist in an interview in December. Daley also said he thinks geneticist and Broad Institute President Eric S. Lander, physician and University of Michigan President Mark S. Schlissel, and Harvard Provost Alan M. Garber ’77 are on the list.
In October, several prominent donors and professors said there are three likely contenders besides Garber from within the University: Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria, Government professor Danielle S. Allen, and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith.
Kim has connections to Harvard and experience heading another Ivy League university. Kim, who holds a M.D. and a Ph.D. in anthropology from Harvard, chaired a Harvard Medical School department, led another department at the Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and directed a research center at the School of Public Health. University presidential search committees have historically preferred candidates with Harvard credentials; the 2001 search committee passed over several top contenders for their lack of a Harvard degree.
Kim also has ties to prominent Harvard faculty. In 1987, he helped found the global health organization Partners in Health along with University professor Paul Farmer, who chairs Harvard’s department of Global Health and Social Medicine.
When Kim took on the Dartmouth presidency in August 2009, he became the first Asian-American to hold the top job at an Ivy League school. During his time in Hanover, N.H., Kim revamped Dartmouth’s global health-related programs and oversaw efforts to better educate students on sexual assault prevention.
But his tenure at Dartmouth was not without controversy. He drew criticism from students and faculty when he declined to release the school’s budget in 2010. And when he left for the World Bank in 2012, some argued his departure from Dartmouth after roughly three years demonstrated a lack of commitment to the university.
Though sources say Kim has discussed the possibility of the Harvard presidency in private, the World Bank leader wrote in a recent memo to colleagues that he plans to stay in his current role.
In a new year’s note to World Bank staff earlier this month, Kim wrote he would continue to further the organization’s mission of alleviating poverty and that he and his colleagues were “in this for the long haul.”
“I look forward to supporting all of you as we continue that mission, in 2018, and in the years to come,” he wrote.
Nonetheless, some of Kim’s former Medical School colleagues said they think he would be an excellent University president. John G. Meara, a professor of Global Health and Social Medicine, wrote in an email in January that he thinks Kim has the “courage” to make the difficult changes and decisions that any large university may need.
Megan Murray, an Epidemiology professor who overlapped with Kim at the Medical School, agreed.
“Harvard needs someone with respected academic credentials as well as high level management and financial experience and that special combination of confidence and tact that characterizes effective leadership. I think Jim has all that and more,” Murray wrote in an email earlier this month.
“I think he would be a great choice—and he should be what Harvard is looking for,” she wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard labor activists led a campaign over the last few weeks urging the University's presidential search committee not to select Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 for the top job.
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers, Harvard’s student unionization effort, and the Student Labor Action Movement, an undergraduate labor advocacy group, spearheaded the movement, criticizing Garber and Smith for sending official University communications they said reflect an anti-union bias. Members of SLAM and HGSU-UAW sent emails and made phone calls to the presidential search committee and University President Drew G. Faust throughout December.
These criticisms come as the presidential search committee—comprising all 12 members of the Harvard Corporation and three members of the Board of Overseers—narrows the pool of candidates and prepares to make its final choice for Harvard's 29th president. In December, The Crimson reported that the searchers had whittled the pool of potential candidates to under 20 finalists.
Garber and Smith are among several candidates likely being considered by the committee. In October, several prominent donors and professors named the two administrators, as well as Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria and Government professor Danielle S. Allen, as probable contenders hailing from within the University.
HGSU-UAW organizer and English Ph.D. candidate Andrew B. Donnelly estimated student activists sent “more than 100” emails to people involved in the search process, though he added the union does not advocate for particular candidates.
Donnelly wrote that he thought Garber and Smith’s previous communication to students about unionization efforts have rendered the duo “unpopular” among pro-union students.
“Given their vocal opposition to the union, Provost Garber and Dean Smith would, I think, be controversial, if not unpopular, choices as president for many grad students,” Donnelly wrote in an email. “Dean Nohria and Prof. Allen, as far as I know, have respected their students’ autonomy on this issue and let students decide for themselves whether they want a union.”
Garber and Smith both declined to comment for this article through University representatives.
In Nov. 2017, Garber wrote in an email to students that the University had worked hard to ensure that the 2016 unionization election was fair. Though the result of the 2016 election recorded more votes against unionization than in favor, the National Labor Relations Board ultimately ruled—roughly a year and several legal battles later—that a voter list Harvard generated prior to the vote was inadequate. The NLRB ordered a re-vote and a new election will likely be held in 2018.
“The University’s goal was always to include all eligible voters on the list,” Garber wrote in Nov. 2017. “A University team worked diligently to create the most accurate list possible despite challenging conditions.”
SLAM member Anselm Kizza-Besigye ’21 said he also believes neither Smith nor Garber, if appointed president of Harvard, would help advance unionization efforts.
“It’s obviously become clear to us at this point that several people who are being considered to be the next president like Provost Garber—Provost Alan Garber—and Dean Smith are actively anti-union as far as we can tell,” Kizza-Besigye said.
Campus labor activists hope to continue to urge the candidates and the search committee to keep labor issues in mind as the presidential search narrows, Kizza-Besigye said.
“We’re watching very closely to see whether or not these professors will stand with the union throughout the process of their nomination and potentially when they become president,” he said.
FAS spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven wrote in an emailed statement that “the University has, and continues to, remind students that the outcome of any election is determined by those who participate.”
“We encourage students to again consider the academic, financial, and personal impacts of unionization and to cast informed votes,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 31, 2018 at 2:17 a.m.
Gullah, a largely oral, African-American creole taught at Harvard for the first time last fall, is now being offered for a second semester.
A combination of West African languages, English, and words and phrases developed by enslaved people in South Carolina, the blended tongue is today spoken in the Gullah Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor, a portion of the American southeast coast from Florida to North Carolina.  Harvard is the first Ivy League school to offer courses in the language.
Sunn m’Cheaux, who teaches Harvad's Gullah courses, wrote in an email that the language’s oral nature stems from the fact the language was originally spoken by slaves.
“Our ancestors were threatened and subjected to brutal consequences, including death, if found to be literate. Therefore, the preservation of our traditions and language relied heavily on the spoken word,” m’Cheaux wrote.
While “Gullah” is the term used to describe this creole, the word also defines the group who speaks the language and their culture.  m’Cheaux characterizes Gullah as more than a language.
“I describe it as 'living word.' Gullah is not only a language, it's a culture and a people. It's literally a language manifested as life,” m’Cheaux wrote.  “It’s not just my first language, it’s my culture.”
m’Cheaux said he learned the Gullah language as a child in a rural, South Carolinian community.
“Everyone around me spoke Gullah. It was so normalized, we didn't even call it Gullah. It was just the way we spoke,” m’Cheaux wrote.
But m’Cheaux’s teachers did not always approve of his creole, so he quickly learned to switch between Gullah and English, he said.
“I can recall feeling humiliated in class by teachers who sought to wring out every drop of Gullah from my ‘broken English’ like dirty wash water from a scrub rag,” m’Cheaux wrote.
m’Cheaux wrote that, even today, spoken Gullah is often discouraged in the classroom. m'Cheaux wrote he has friends who were criticized for using the language.
But m’Cheaux wrote that he sees Harvard’s decision to teach Gullah as a sort of validation; he hopes that support for teaching the language will help Gullah and Geechee school children “be embraced in academia.”
m’Cheaux described the language as “intricate” and “nuanced,” making master difficult to achieve for non-native speakers.  Despite Gullah’s oral origins, m’Cheaux said he believes teaching a written component of the language is critical.
“My general philosophy for helping non-Gullah speakers understand the language is to emphasize the importance of using phonetics and literacy in tandem… sound is integral to the learning of Gullah, but translating and communicating it in written form is imperative for us to preserve the language,” he wrote.
Gullah joins over thirty other languages taught through Harvard’s African Language Program.   m’Cheaux wrote that Harvard seemed like the natural place for Gullah instruction.
“It was easy to see how Gullah could make itself a home within a space where other creoles like Jamaican patois had already been embraced,” m’Cheaux wrote.  “Moreover, the ‘father of Gullah studies’ (Lorenzo Dow Turner) was himself a Harvard University graduate.”
m’Cheaux wrote that he hopes other institutions will “follow suit” in offering the language.
This article has been updated to reflect the following correction.
UPDATED: January 31, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly referred to a portion of the American southeast coast from Florida to North Carolina as the Gullah Geechee Heritage Corridor. In fact, that portion of the coast is known as the Gullah Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduates learned about the benefits of careers in public service at a conference held Sunday and attended by over 500 students, faculty, staff, and alumni.
Coordinated by the Phillips Brooks House for Public Service and Engaged Scholarship, the event—titled the Public Interested Conference—is a recent initiative the College debuted to encourage students to consider public sector jobs after graduation.
Kristen M. Clarke ’97, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, gave the keynote speech at the conference, arguing public service affords an important way to respond to the current political climate.
Clarke said the justice system should advance civil rights, but said the current presidential administration under Donald Trump “has done tremendous damage” to the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division instead.
She said she was particularly  concerned  by actions Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken regarding affirmative action policies at universities across the United States, including the Department of Justice’s ongoing investigation into Harvard’s admissions practices. Clarke called Sessions's behavior a “national attack.”
“It’s important that we stand up and fight for principles that lie at the heart of our democracy,” Clarke said. “I believe that we have an obligation to make sure that the generation behind us inherits a world that is better than what we have today.”
Many students said they appreciated the existence of a public service-oriented conference like Sunday's conference, the likes of which did not take place at Harvard until 2012.
Mo Kim ’18 said hearing from alumni who are involved in public service—especially hearing about how “they found themselves on the path that they’re on right now”—was helpful.
"[Alumni] talked very openly about their struggles and some of the challenges that they faced,” Kim said.
Just seven percent of the College’s Class of 2017 went on to careers in government, military service, nonprofits, or nongovernmental organizations, according to a survey from the Office of Career Services. Conference attendee Ryan R. Hatch ’18 said he finds that figure “shocking.”
“I was surprised to find out that a lot of people weren’t into it,” Hatch said. “It was really amazing to see and hear all of these amazing, inspiring people coming together.”
“There’s a lot of focus—and a lot of pressure—for students to go into the private sector and into finance and consulting, so it was really cool to be able to have a conference this big,” Mia L. Bladin ’18 said. “It’s not something that you hear about as often.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Iceland President Guðni Th. Jóhannesson spoke about the country’s robust economic growth as well as the #MeToo movement during his visit to the Institute of Politics last week.
Jóhannesson was elected in Aug. 2016 in the wake of the resignation of the Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson, who gave up the presidency after revelations about his links to secretive companies in offshore tax havens. The former historian rode a wave of anti-establishment sentiment and won election to the largely ceremonial role on a “non-partisan” platform. He now enjoys an 81.8 percent approval rating in Iceland, according to The Reykjavík Grapevine in June 2017.
“I think you have to have the right balance between belief in yourself and your capability to be a force for good and humility and awareness that you are not better than the rest,” Jóhannesson said in an interview with reporters before his speech Friday when asked about his approval rating.
Jóhannesson touched upon Iceland’s strong recovery from the 2008 financial crisis, citing growth in the important industries of fishing and technology. Jóhannesson also highlighted the growth of the tourism industry–1.7 million tourists visited Iceland in 2016, triple the number that visited in 2010.
“We need to have a free flow of people and ideas and services,” Jóhannesson said. “We need to build an open economy and then the future will be bright.”
Icelandic pride was on display during his visit, as he used the example of the national soccer team’s unlikely qualification to the World Cup as a time Iceland “punched above their weight”–a phrase repeated by Jóhannesson throughout the speech.  Still, Jóhannesson underlined the importance of an “inclusive” sense of national pride.
“[Nationalism] gives you a sense that you are part of society and we are in this business together of living here and creating a better world,” Jóhannesson said. “Therefore, it is imperative and essential that nationalism be inclusive and tolerant.”
Jóhannesson also emphasized that Iceland is “not here to be perfect,” referencing the #MeToo movement’s presence in the county.
“While I agree that Iceland is in many ways a more secure place than other parts of the world, we should definitely not just simply salute that fact and pride ourselves of that and ignore the bitter truth that there is plenty we could do so much better,” Jóhannesson said.
“I think for us Icelanders we can enjoy the fact that you guys, for instance, see ourselves as a safe secure happy country but must never just stop there and honestly face the fact that we can not tolerate sexual harassment, sexual violence,” he added.
Talk about President Trump was not absent from the Icelandic President’s visit. When asked if he would be meeting with the U.S. President during his trip, Jóhannesson said he did not plan to pay a visit to the White House.
“I will not be meeting President Trump on this trip. It is a very short visit. I arrived yesterday and I leave this afternoon, so maybe some other day," Jóhannesson said.

Over 70 students gathered in Fong Auditorium to consider the pros and cons of building a multicultural center on campus at a Friday town hall hosted by the Undergraduate Council.
During the town hall, undergraduates debated the need for a multicultural space and considered what that space might look like. Council representatives Nicholas P. Whittaker ’19 and Salma Abdelrahman ’20—who lead the Multicultural Center Coalition, a UC group advocating for the construction of such a center—moderated the event.
Roland S. Davis, the College’s associate dean for diversity and inclusion, attended, as did Council President Catherine L. Zhang ’19.
The UC plans to hand a policy proposal for the center to administrators in March.
Multiple attendees spoke about the difficulty identity-based organizations currently face finding spaces for events, given many lack spaces of their own. Some called on Harvard to do more to provide financial assistance for campus cultural groups.
Whittaker and Abdelrahman outlined a draft of the coalition’s policy proposal at the town hall.
The proposal will call for research into the history of minority communities and intercommunal relations at Harvard, in addition to looking at models of multicultural centers at other universities, according to Whittaker.  The research will identify more specifically the current problem that exists and recommend whether a multicultural space comprises the most effective course of action.
The proposal will then recommend the formation of a task force to design an implementation plan, based on the findings of the research.
The coalition hopes to submit its proposal to Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana before spring break, seeking a “public commitment” from Khurana that would allow the process to move forward, according to Whittaker.
Attendees also spoke about what they would want to see in a prospective multicultural center. Many argued that a portion of the center should be devoted to works of art created by people of color. Others emphasized the importance of using the center to provide on-campus jobs and internships.
Mayukha Karnam ’19 argued that a multicultural center would allow students who do not feel included in identity-based groups on campus to gain a sense of belonging.
“I think cultural organizations can sometimes be unintentionally excluding people and people may not feel like it's the safest space for them to enter, even if on paper their identity matches up with that,” Karnam said.
Iris R. Feldman ’20 agreed. She drew on her past experiences at Harvard to argue that the College needs an all-inclusive space on campus.
“I'm a mixed student here. I don't really feel comfortable or welcome at a lot of the cultural organizations that already exist and I feel like a space that's specifically designated as multicultural... would allow me to exist in a space where I feel comfortable with other people of color but don't have to necessarily decide what identity I am that day,” Feldman said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 31, 2018 at 1:57 a.m.
Dozens of Harvard affiliates remain uncertain about their futures after government officials announced earlier this month that changes to the Temporary Protected Status program will end protections for nearly 200,000 Salvadorans.
Created by Congress in 1990 to offer provisional humanitarian relief, TPS is a program that provides some immigrants with temporary refuge in the United States if their home countries are affected by armed conflict or natural disaster.
Salvadorans have been eligible for temporary protection to live and work legally in the U.S. since 2001, when two devastating earthquakes struck their country. At the time, the Bush administration determined conditions in El Salvador were too precarious to permit inhabitants to return home.
The decision to scale back the number of immigrants from El Salvador marks the Trump administration’s latest efforts to reverse years of immigration policies that extended protection under TPS for immigrants from not just El Salvador, but also from Haiti and Nicaragua, among several other countries. The Trump administration stripped TPS status from Haitians last month and Nicaraguans last year. Sudanese immigrants will be stripped of their  TPS benefits in Nov. 2018, the Trump Administration announced in Sept. 2017.
“We are deeply concerned about the administration’s recent withdrawal of TPS for those from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Sudan and the impact it could have on members of the community,” University spokesperson  Melodie L. Jackson wrote in an emailed statement. “Our colleagues play a vital role at Harvard and they add to our community in significant ways.”
According to the Harvard International Office website, only three students and scholars across all of Harvard’s schools hail from El Salvador. Six come from Haiti, two from Sudan, and four from Honduras. Liala Buoniconti, a social worker for the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program, said the withdrawal of TPS is likely to impact a greater number of staff members than students.
Jackson wrote that the TPS policy shift could impact many Harvard employees.
“There are several dozen members of the Harvard community working across a variety of departments who are likely to be impacted by the recent changes to TPS,” she wrote.
Jackson wrote that the University is working closely with the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program, Harvard Human Resources, and student affairs offices to provide support services as needed for University affiliates who may be affected by the policy changes.
In an email sent to Harvard affiliates Friday, Leslie Kirwan, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean for Administration and Finance, wrote that, at such a turbulent time, the FAS remains “committed to supporting all its members with the resources they need to thrive.”
In the same email, Kirwan  wrote that anyone with TPS from Sudan, Nicaragua, Haiti or El Salvador should contact the immigration and refugee clinic to discuss their options. At the clinic, attorneys and students at Harvard Law School provide immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers with free legal consultations about TPS and  other immigration concerns like Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. HIRC also offers social services during walk-in hours at Cabot Science Library on Wednesdays from 3 p.m. to 4:30 pm.
The University hired immigration attorney Jason Corral last year to provide legal counsel to undocumented students. Corral, who could not be reached for comment, is the only full-time attorney on campus charged with addressing immigration-related issues.
Buoniconti said the clinic takes a holistic approach in providing both social services and legal support to “folks who may have fear or are scared about the new changes.” Buoniconti said the clinic also offers mental health services.
Last week, the University updated its Undocumented at Harvard website with more information on TPS and the various ways in which affected members of the school can make use of resources on campus.

Harvard’s endowment returns fell three points below the national average for college and university endowments in fiscal year 2017, according to a nationwide report released last week.
The report, published by the National Association of College and University Business Officers and Commonfund, surveyed 809 U.S. institutions and found average endowment returns of 12.2 percent—significantly higher than the 2.4 percent average endowment growth reported in 2015 and negative 1.9 percent reported in 2016. Despite this stronger performance last fiscal year, university endowments still show 10-year decline in value overall.
Large endowments over $1 billion posted average returns of 12.9 percent, while endowments smaller than $25 million returned 11.6 percent, according to the NACUBO-Commonfund report. Harvard remains the largest university endowment at over $37.1 billion, but its performance lagged behind its peers: The University earned an 8.1 percent return in fiscal year 2017, the lowest returns in the Ivy League. Steep write-downs brought returns down from more than 11 percent to 8.1 percent. The board agreed on $1 billion in write-downs of natural resource investments.
In Harvard’s 2017 financial report, N.P. “Narv” Narvekar wrote that “deep structural problems at HMC” and “significant issues in the portfolio” were responsible for the poor returns. Since taking over as CEO of Harvard Management Company—the university’s investment arm—in Dec. 2016, Narvekar has enacted a number of changes in strategy and management. He moved the endowment from a silo strategy, in which individual managers focused solely on their portfolio, to a generalist model in which all managers are responsible for net returns.
Narvekar also pushed to outsource HMC’s money managers—multiple hedge funds spun off from HMC and Narvekar announced in 2017 he would lay off half of his 230-person staff. Harvard’s in-house real estate team will move to Bain Capital in February, but will continue to invest Harvard’s money.
In the NACUBO-Commonwealth report, NACUBO President and CEO John D. Walda cautioned against reading too much optimism into the jump in returns, citing the endowment tax and changes to charitable giving laws in the new tax law Republican lawmakers passed in December.
“Despite this year’s higher returns, we remain concerned about the continued long-term results for most endowments,” Walda wrote in the report.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After voting issues plagued the Undergraduate Council’s most recent presidential election, the UC will roll out new election software beginning with this week’s midterm elections.
UC Vice President Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 announced the new software at the Council’s first meeting of the year Sunday.
The new software will utilize an external system, created by OrgSync, an online management company that already provides software to Harvard, Boucher said. Harvard University Information Technology managed the UC’s previous election software.
During last November’s presidential election, some students reported they were unable to access the Council’s voting website. In response, the UC’s Election Commission allowed students to submit ballots via email, though those votes were ultimately not counted due to concerns over duplicate voting.
Winthrop House Representative Evan M. Bonsall ’19 said he finds the new system problematic, largely due to concerns about information security. He pointed out that the previous system successfully prevented harmful actors from tampering with the election results.
“Do you have a plan in place prevent people from hacking the UC voting system?” Bonsall asked.  “The main advantage of the old system is that it was kind of hard to hack and was operated by the University.”
Boucher assured Bonsall the new software was more secure than the current software, arguing it has been more thoroughly tested.
“We’re very confident that it’s secure because we’re using professional software that we’ve outsourced,” Boucher said. “It’s a very high-budget contract that the university signed with this particular company and it’s actually used for student elections at quite a lot of schools across the country.”
Voting for this year’s midterm elections will take place between Tuesday and Thursday.
During the meeting, the Undergraduate Council also voted to allocate $3,000 towards “Harvard Conversations,” a new student-run program to facilitate informal interactions between faculty and students.
The initiative, which utilizes one of the UC’s “burst packs,” will follow a similar model as Classroom to Table, the popular College program that pays for students to eat at local restaurants with their professors. Harvard Conversations will pay for catered dinners in House common rooms.
Winthrop House Representative Sruthi Palaniappan ’20, who co-sponsored the legislation, acknowledged that the UC’s contribution will only partly fund the new program, but said that administrators have offered to fund the remaining amount.
“Jay Harris, who is head of the Office of Undergraduate Education, has expressed interest in supporting this program,” Palaniappan said.   “But we want to front this $3,000, one burst pack, even though we know that the program is going to cost more because if we are able to put this money up out front, he will cover the rest.”
During the meeting, UC President Catherine L. Zhang ’19 announced that Wilfried J. Zibell ’21 will serve as the Council’s new Rules Committee chair, and Sonya Kalara ’21 will serve as the new parliamentarian.

Datamatch—the Harvard Computer Society’s annual Valentine’s Day matchmaking survey—will include three gender categories this year after facing criticism from students about its lack of a non-binary gender option in 2017.
Datamatch will offer man, woman, and non-binary as possible categories, according to team member Russell F. Pekala ’19. Members of the Datamatch team announced the change, among other changes to the program, at the Undergraduate Council’s first general meeting of the year Sunday.
“Really our goal at Datamatch is to build in a third gender option for matching purposes just like the other two options,” Pekala said. “We don’t want gender to be a big part of Datamatch at all.  We want everyone to be excited about it.”
Datamatch team members also announced other changes to the program at the UC meeting. For the first time, the program will expand to multiple colleges around the Boston area.
Last year, Datamatch participants had to choose to identify either as male or female, but were allowed to add comments about their gender identity in a section at the end of the survey designated for “extra” information.
Datamatch drew criticism for the format, which some students argued excluded students who identify as non-binary. Still, nearly 5,000 students registered for the program in 2017.
Following the criticism, 26 members of last year’s UC, including then-UC President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 and Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18, signed a letter admonishing Datamatch’s restrictive gender choices.
This year, participants will also be allowed to provide up to 100 characters of additional information about their gender identity, according to Pekala, and will be allowed to choose whether gender information is displayed on their profile at all.
Datamatch will also debut a “checkbox model” to allow students to select which of the three gender options with which they would like to match.
“We hope that will give people a lot of flexibility in how they are presenting themselves,” Pekala said.
Pekala said he and other members of the Datamatch team met with multiple students who complained about the lack of a third option last year. He said Datamatch decided on final changes by seeking “consensus” with Harvard students who were “personally affected by last year’s mistakes.”
Datamatch team member Catherine Tu ’20 also said the Datamatch team is in the process of finalizing new agreements with Crema Cafe, Mike’s Pastry, and L.A. Burdick’s for meals this year. Last year, Datamatch partnered with El Jefe’s Taqueria, Flour Bakery, BerryLine, and Zinneken’s.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several Kennedy School professors traveled to Davos, Switzerland last week for the World Economic Forum, which focused in part on issues of gender and women’s empowerment.
Douglas W. Elmendorf, dean of the Kennedy School, attended, as did several other prominent Kennedy School leaders including Ashton B. Carter, director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and former U.S. defense secretary.
The World Economic Forum is a nonprofit foundation based in Switzerland that brings together thousands of politicians, economists, and academics to discuss international issues like global development and climate change. The 2018 Forum took place from Jan. 23 to Jan. 26.
“Dean Elmendorf, along with other members of the Harvard Kennedy School faculty, attended the Forum to contribute to thinking and ideas about how we can shape a better future for the world through better leadership and policies,” Kennedy School spokesperson Douglas L. Gavel said.
Elmendorf participated in a Facebook live broadcast with David R. Gergen, director of the school’s Center for Public Leadership, where the two discussed the role of the Kennedy School in promoting democracy worldwide, as well as the development of an executive education program. Gergen has traveled to the World Economic Forum since 1988, according to his research assistant, Gregory Honan.
The World Economic Forum, a gathering known for its elite status, generated controversy earlier this month after President Donald Trump’s dinner with the executives of drug companies Novartis and Bayer. Trump is the first sitting president in two decades to attend the Forum.
One Kennedy School lecturer who traveled to Davos, Jane Nelson, said that, while certain themes appear every year at the conference, this year had a particular focus on gender and the fourth industrial revolution.
“This year, clearly one of the stronger themes was gender,” Nelson said. “The whole question of women’s leadership, women’s economic empowerment, and gender parity was a very strong theme this year.”
She said it is important for academics, including those from the Kennedy School, to attend conferences like the Forum because they work with the Forum to  perform surveys, deliver reports, and create dialogues through panels.
“Academics play a very vital role as knowledge partners, as learning partners, and on occasion provocateurs,” Nelson said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 29, 2018 at 11:05 p.m.
The Department of Justice investigation into Harvard’s race-based admissions policies was likely prompted by ongoing civil litigation over allegations of discrimination against Asian-American applicants, according to several legal experts.
Legal analysts and former Justice Department officials said a lawsuit filed in 2015 by the organization Students for Fair Admissions was a significant factor in the department’s recently reported decision to launch an investigation into Harvard’s admissions policies.
Peter F. Lake ’81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law, said he thinks the SFFA lawsuit is the most likely among several possible catalysts for the probe.
“My guess is that the primary motivation is there's already an ongoing lawsuit,” Lake said.
Roger Clegg, a former deputy assistant attorney general, also said that the ongoing litigation may have, in part, motivated the investigation.
“My understanding is that the Justice Department… was aware of this other lawsuit that had been filed by private parties against Harvard and so they decided that they wanted to look for additional evidence to see what role the Justice Department’s going to play. So they began to make inquiries of Harvard, too,” Clegg said.
According to Clegg, it is not uncommon for the department to survey pending court cases when considering potential investigations.
“Sometimes, we’d look at ongoing cases that were in litigation brought by other parties and we would be trying to decide whether it made sense for the Justice Department to get involved in the case, too,” Clegg said.
In an email, Justice Department spokesperson Devin M. O’Malley pointed to an earlier statement issued by the department.
"The Justice Department is committed to protecting all Americans from all forms of illegal race-based discrimination,” O’Malley wrote in that statement.
Lake suggested that there is a possibility that the Justice Department sees its interests as being aligned with those of the plaintiffs.
“It could be the Justice Department has aligned its interests to some extent with the private parties, and they're using its leverage to gain discovery that would be harder to get without Justice Department intervention,” Lake said.
When asked about possible reasons for the Justice Department investigation, Edward Blum, the president of SFFA, pointed instead to an administrative complaint filed in May 2015 with the Justice and Education Departments.
“An Asian advocacy group comprised of 63 independent groups asked DOJ to investigate Harvard and other Ivy League schools,” Blum wrote in an emailed statement.
The Department of Education dismissed the complaint in July 2015.
Clegg said the previous investigative groundwork on Harvard’s admissions policies makes the University an attractive subject for further inquiries on its admissions policies.
“This is a case that the federal government had already been investigating. It had been investigating it during the Obama administration,” Clegg said. “There were files on it that the federal government had and that were sent to the Justice Department. How many other cases like that are there? I think none.”
The SFFA lawsuit is currently in the late stages of its discovery phase, with discovery and depositions scheduled for completion on May 1, 2018.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A crucial last second stop by Harvard women’s basketball preserved an 87-85 victory over Brown on Saturday evening in a game that featured no shortage of offense. The home team’s 87 points were its second highest total of the year and helped the team advance to an 8-0 mark at home, moving the Crimson into second place in the conference.
Harvard (11-6, 3-1 Ivy) struggled from the field, shooting just 34 percent from three-point range, just a night after shooting 63 percent from beyond the arc against Yale. But the Crimson was able to battle back, employing solid rebounding and clutch late shooting to hand the Bears (13-4, 1-3) their second loss of the weekend.
“They’re a good team, they’re going to be tough for everyone to beat,” said coach Kathy Delaney Smith. “For us to win this game when our shots were not falling was great. I am very proud of my team’s effort and poise down the stretch.”
A contest that swung back and forth for most of the four quarters was decided in the last five seconds, when sophomore guard Katie Benzan made one of two free throws to give Harvard a two point lead.
“I needed to make both to seal the deal,” Benzan said of the late-game drama. “But one is better than none.”
Brown inbounded the ball to guard Dominique Leonidas, who dribbled the length of the court to try to tie the game and send it to overtime. But ferocious defense by junior guard Madeline Raster forced Leonidas into an off-balance shot that bounced harmlessly off the backboard and sent a jubilant Crimson team to its fourth consecutive win.
Instead of allowing Justine Gaziano or Shayna Metha to take the final shot, who scored 28 and 25 points respectively in Saturday’s game, Harvard’s frenetic defense forced the ball into the hands of Leonidas, a freshman averaging only three points per game.
The game had the makings of a classic from the start, as good early defense by the Crimson kept the Bears scoreless for the first two and a half minutes and allowed the hosts to jump out to a 9-0 lead, riding the momentum from Friday’s blowout win over Yale. But Brown replied fearlessly, scoring 11 unanswered points, part of a 23-2 run by the visitors.
Gaziano, a sophomore guard from Natick, Mass., was instrumental in the Bears’ run, scoring 17 first quarter points, equalling her season average. Gaziano converted all three of her first quarter three-pointers, and helped the Bears build an 11 point lead.
Harvard responded to the run by trying to tighten its defense and limit Brown’s fast-paced style of offense.
“We knew that they leaked out in transition,” Benzan said. “Once we stopped their transition baskets, it’s so much easier, just taking those easy shots away.”
A last-second three-pointer by senior guard Taylor Rooks narrowed the deficit to 29-21 entering the second quarter, and set the stage for a game that would feature late drama in three of the four quarters.
For a second consecutive night, Rooks anchored Harvard’s offense, scoring nine early points to help the hosts remain within striking distance. As she did Friday, Rooks surpassed 20 points, scoring 24 points and chipping in with seven rebounds, even more impressive due to her foul trouble. Playing only 27 minutes, and with four fouls down the stretch, Rooks converted four of five attempts from beyond the arc, crucial on a night when the typically sharpshooting Raster went 0-5 from three.
As the Crimson tried to cut into the Bears’ lead, the last three minutes of the half became Sydney Skinner time. The junior guard, who had been 1-6 shooting, exploded for three baskets and a beautiful assist to sophomore Jeannie Boehm.
As it had in the first quarter, the Crimson ended the second with a last-second basket, as freshman forward Jadyn Bush crashed the glass and tipped in a rebound to beat the buzzer and cut Brown’s lead to one point at the intermission.
Despite Brown shooting 58 percent from the field, Harvard trailed by only one at halftime.
The third quarter was a back and forth affair, and a key basket from senior guard Kirby Porter gave the Crimson a 49-47 advantage, its first lead since 9-8.
A three-pointer from Rooks and two from Katie Benzan, one of which came from halfway to midcourt, helped Harvard pull away, giving the hosts a 63-56 lead and forcing Brown to take a timeout.
But the Bears refused to go quietly into the Cambridge night, fighting back with two layups and a pair of free throws by Gaziano to cut the Crimson lead to one.
But once again, the momentum swung the hosts’ way. An incredibly acrobatic steal and save by Raster led to a transition three from Sydney Skinner, giving Harvard a six point lead and igniting the Lavietes Pavilion crowd to its loudest.
“We have such great crowds,” Benzan said. “Everyone’s coming and cheering, and the environment is just amazing.”
Harvard entered the final quarter with a four point lead, but the Crimson’s momentum was quelled by an offensive foul call on Rooks, relegating her to the bench with four fouls. Bush entered the game for Rooks and immediately contributed with a key layup. Bush showed no freshman nerves Saturday, playing 16 crucial minutes, and converting all four of her attempts from the field.
With under two minutes remaining, the Crimson led by three when Skinner pried the ball from Gaziano’s hands, giving Harvard the ball, but Rooks misfired from deep to give Brown the ball again.
A layup from Leonidas cut the lead to one, and Benzan was fouled with five seconds remaining, setting the stage for an incredible finish.
Benzan and the rest of the Crimson played with maturity and poise down the stretch, allowing Harvard to extend its home unbeaten streak, much to the delight of coach Delaney-Smith.
“The big question mark about us is our inconsistency, our ability to play under pressure,” Delaney-Smith said. “I am so proud that we were able to play through that tonight.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Making the trek down to Providence, R.I., the Harvard women’s hockey team snapped a seven-game losing skid with a convincing 6-1 win at Brown. After dropping a close 3-2 matchup to Yale in New Haven, Conn., on Friday evening, the Crimson tallied its most goals in one game since Nov. 17 against Holy Cross.
“I think we played Harvard hockey for an entire sixty minutes, and we brought a lot of energy,” said junior co-captain Kate Hallett of the team’s victory over the Bears. “We took what happened the night before, we came back with a lot of resilience, we were ready to play, and we just had a lot of fun.”
HARVARD 6, BROWN 1
The Crimson (9-11-1, 7-8-1 ECAC) made the most of its power plays on Saturday, while the Bears (2-21-0, 1-15-0) struggled to keep up from the very beginning of the game.
Sophomore Kat Hughes opened the scoring for Harvard within five minutes, redirecting a shot from the left side from her first-year linemate Brooke Jovanovich. With the Crimson looking dominant straight away, freshman Keely Moy added a second goal on a power play. The puck took a bizarre bounce over rookie goaltender Lauren Rippy midway through the first period to put the visitors up, 2-0.
Harvard added two goals in each of the second and third frames as well, with Moy grabbing her second of the night, and fellow rookie Becca Gilmore finding the net twice in the third period. Gilmore’s double dip gives her the team lead in points with 20, while she and Moy are tied for second in goals with 7 apiece. Brown senior forward Sam Donovan struck with ten minutes remaining in the game, but it was too little, too late for the team whose season has been all but over for weeks now.
In net for the Crimson was freshman Becky Dutton (1.26 GAA, .948 SV%), making her second career start and earning her first ever win. While sophomore backstop Beth Larcom struggled between the pipes against Yale the night before, Dutton provided some stability—albeit against a team that does not generate much offense—on Saturday.
The win at Brown moved Harvard up to seventh place in the ECAC and tied with Ancient Eight rival Princeton. With six conference games remaining, there is still plenty to play for, and the Crimson will be hoping that its losing streak will be forgotten as it looks to book a chance at ECAC glory with a top-eight finish.
“Our mindset is to get everything we can out of every practice, and to show up to every game ready to put everything on the line,” Gilmore said. “We have to find a way to come together and get wins against teams with very strong programs. I think we have it in us, and it’s going to be exciting to see what we can do.”
YALE 3, HARVARD 2
Harvard and Yale (9-10-4, 7-7-2) came into their matchup neck and neck in the ECAC standings, with the game holding big conference playoff implications. After their first meeting of the season ended in a 2-2 tie following overtime, both teams were looking for a decisive win against their oldest rival.
After a hard-fought but scoreless first frame, the goals poured in during the second period. The Bulldogs struck first through freshman forward Greta Skarzynski on a power play, but the Crimson was quick to respond, with senior Nikki Friesen finding the net on a power play of the visitors’ own less than four minutes later. Yale quickly bounced back, scoring two back to back goals before the end of the second period to pull ahead, 3-1, and chasing Larcom (8-10-1, 2.88 GA, .900 SV%) from the net.
Harvard managed to put the pressure on in the final period, but freshman defender Emma Buckles’s rebound goal with eight minutes remaining was not enough to secure a win for the visitors.
Despite the outcome, the Crimson took the game to its hosts in New Haven, outshooting the Bulldogs, 31-28, in addition to winning 33 faceoffs to Yale’s 24. Harvard was also better on power plays, converting two of its four opportunities, compared to Yale’s 1-for-3 record on the day.
“Obviously it’s always tough to lose, especially a big Ivy League game against Yale,” Hallett said. “They definitely came to play, and we did too, but unfortunately we couldn’t get the job done.”
Power plays were central to the Crimson’s offense in this weekend’s conference matchups. Before this weekend, Harvard had struggled to make the most of its 5-on-4 opportunities, scoring only ten times against shorthanded opposition in nineteen games. In stark contrast to this trend, the Crimson managed to score on five power plays in the Yale and Brown games alone.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
New year, same Gabby Thomas.
The junior co-captain did not miss a beat ringing in the new year. Sprinting in the Columbia Challenge, one of the track and field team’s two meets this weekend, the Florence, Mass., native outran her own, which also happened to be Harvard and the Ivy League’s, top time in the 60-meter dash.
“When I line up to run, especially at a high caliber meet such as the one at the armory, I’m making sure that I am not distracted by who is in the lanes next to me,” Thomas said. “The most important thing is to focus on what I can control, such as my race plan. For me that means pushing out really hard and a few technical things that I need to fix. Every race is an opportunity to work on that.”
Crossing the finish line in 7.26 seconds, Thomas finished among a top-six featuring three Oregon sprinters. The top time matched the New England record in the race, set by UConn’s Trish-Ann Hawthorn in 2011—at the same track.
“Breaking my own record is an amazing feeling,” Thomas said. “It means progress and I’m on an upward slope. I’m trying to get that 60-meter to the 7.10s so this is a good sign.”
Thomas’ performance was one of several first-place finishes by the Crimson track and field team this weekend. A skeleton squad traveled to the Columbia Challenge at the New York City Armory on Friday, while Sunday’s Harvard-Yale-Princeton Meet featured the entire group. Competing against its division rivals, the Crimson took second place in both the men’s and women’s divisions, both times falling to Princeton but downing Yale.
H-Y-P MEET
Competing at its own Gordon Indoor Track, Harvard fielded its first full event of the indoor season. The women’s team amassed 63 points, 15 less than the victorious Tigers. The men grabbed 51 points for team, 48 below the mark set by Princeton.
Freshmen contributed substantially to the team’s result on the weekend. In her first ever collegiate indoor race, freshman Abbe Goldstein was the first to finish, doing so 4:49.96 on the mile. Running half that distance, classmate Ryan Thrush running also in his first indoor race, took the top spot in the 1:55.09 two-lap sprint.
From then on, the Crimson dominated in what has become the team’s bread-and-butter, the short sprints, hurdles, and relays. Junior Ngozi Musa started things off with a bang. In her second race that week, the third-year crossed the line in 7.58 seconds and left the track with a gold medal around her neck for the 60-meter dash.
The hurdle variant of the race brought two more pieces of gold jewelry to the Harvard squad. For the men, co-captain Jay Hebert nabbed the top spot with a season best of 8.02 followed closely by first-year Erick Duffy, claiming silver. On the women’s side of the 60-meter hurdles, sophomore Livia Gauntlett also hit a season best mark in her first place finish of 8.49 seconds.
Sophomore Micah Meekins replicated the feat, but ran a bit further. In the 200-meter dash, the sophomore beat the rest of the field to the finish line, doing so in 24.91 seconds.
In mid-distance, sophomore Maya Miklos maintained her season hegemony on the genre. The sophomore took first with a clean two seconds to spare between her and the second place finisher. Junior co-captain Myles Marshall did the same, taking the gold medal with just under three seconds of space between himself in the next best sprinter.
The relays teams claimed their, what is now weekly, gold medals. For the women’s 4x440-yard relay, it was all sophomores. Comprising second-year classmates Zoe Hughes, Miklos, Karina Joiner, and Meekins, the quartet grabbed a smooth gold medal in 3:50.50. The men’s squad replicated the feat. Senior Matt Hurst, Marshall, freshman Jovahn Williamson, and freshman Rodney Agyare-May finished first, this time in 3:16.02.
Not to be outdone, the men’s 4x880-yard relay ascended to the top of the podium as well. Senior Jonas Aranda, Thrush, senior Gabe Montague, and sophomore Mike Kolor claimed the top spot in 7:43.49. However for a bit, it didn’t look like they would. Kolor turned on the gas as he rounded the final corner of track, claiming the lead with just 50 yards remaining.
The men’s team is in a particular strong spot with its relay teams. Last week the group split the team into two separate 4x400-meter groups. The two groups finished first and second.
“The relays going one and two [last week] I think shows the quality of the team we have,” Marshall said. “More than anything it shows our competitive spirit and excitement surrounding the event.”
The student-athletes in the field found success of their own, particularly in the jumps. In long jump, sophomore Simi Fajemisin achieved a season best on a 5.77-meter leap for the gold medal on her third attempt. Thomas took second in the event, jumping once for 5.70 meters.
Co-captain Marlena Sabatino also achieved a season best mark on the afternoon, taking the gold medal following a 3.90-meter vault. Teammate junior Nicole Trenchard left with bronze. On the men’s side, Ian West cleared the 5.05-meter mark, enough for the second place medal.
Sophomore Gunnar Allison also reached the second position on the platform with a 15.86-meter toss in the weight throw event.
COLUMBIA CHALLENGE
For the first meet of the weekend, only a few of the team’s athletes traveled to New York Friday to compete in the competitive Columbia Challenge. Featuring some of the nation’s top track programs, including Oregon and Duke, the competition was one of the most difficult the team has faced this season.
In addition to Thomas’ domination in the 60-meter dash, she claimed another gold in the 200-meter dash, crossing the line in 23.04 seconds. Joiner joined her among the top ranks with after 8.49 second finish in the 60-meter hurdles that merited fifth place.
Fajemisin wrapped things up with a silver medal finish in triple jump. The sophomore leapt 12.70 meters, out-jumping athletes from Duke, Ohio State, Wisconsin, and UCLA.
“I think while we might have things going well so far compared to the local area we have to keep in mind our goals of competing at the stage of Heps,” Marshall said. “I think that everyone on the team, no matter their results, has stuff to work on, and I would hope and expect to see things come better together over the next few weeks.”

In the midst of a five-match homestand, the No. 3 Harvard men’s squash team kept on rolling this weekend at the Murr Center. Facing off against non-conference opponents No. 8 Rochester and No. 12 Drexel, the Crimson (7-1, 2-1 Ivy) extended its streak of 9-0 victories to three consecutive matches. The one blemish on Harvard’s record remains its 4-5 loss at the hands of No. 2 Columbia—other than in that match, the Crimson has not lost any other individual matches this season.
“I think the wins we've had recently against some strong teams are a great showing of the overall fitness and quality of the team right now,” sophomore Sean Hughes said. “While they have been some good performances I think...that we can continue to raise our level of play.”
HARVARD 9, DREXEL 0
Sunday brought more of the same for Harvard’s opponent, this time the Dragons (5-8). The Crimson remains undefeated against Drexel, having won all three of the matches in the schools’ all-time series.
Coach Mike Way went with nearly the same players on the second game of the back-to-back weekend set, and the strategy paid off. The only switch was an appearance from junior Alexi Gosset in the ninth spot, replacing senior Bradley Smith.
Gosset and his younger brother Julien put on two of the more outstanding performances against the Dragons. In his first game action of the weekend, the elder Gosset won his first game, 11-8, and then coasted to a 3-0 victory with consecutive 11-2 scores. Julien Gosset, competing in the seventh spot, conceded just 10 total points across his three-game sweep, 11-4, 11-2, 11-4.
In this match, only two Drexel players managed to win games against Harvard opponents. Hughes played a relatively close match against Bransten Ming, who secured an 11-9 win over Hughes in their second game. However, Hughes managed to beat Ming by a combined seven points in the other three games. In the sixth position, co-captain Madhav Dhingra also dropped his second game, but he likewise rallied in the third and fourth games to take the match.
Even when matches are closely contested, the Crimson seem well-prepared to buckle down and grind out victories.
“Our ability to perform well under pressure comes down to our preparation,” Hughes said. “We've been working hard on court and in the gym, but I think the often less recognized aspect is the mental preparation. Our coaches and team place an emphasis on the mental game on court and off court.”
HARVARD 9, ROCHESTER 0
In Saturday’s match against the Yellowjackets (3-4), the back half of Harvard’s lineup exhibited the most prowess, but players one through nine all came away with victories.
Six Crimson picked up three-game sweeps. Of Harvard's three individual-game losses, it only lost by a combined nine points.
In the top spot, Saadeldin Abouaish handily won his first two games, 11-6 and 11-5. The sophomore faltered in the third game, losing to opponent Ashley Davies, 8-11. However, Abouaish rallied in the fourth contest and secured a match victory with a strong 11-3 mark.
The most dominant performances of the day came from the middle of the pack at the No. 4 and 5 spots. Co-captain David Ryan defeated Rochester’s Ricardo Lopez, 11-5, 11-8, 11-3. Right behind Ryan, rookie Samuel Scherl emerged victorious over Yellowjackets counterpart Matthew Toth, 11-2, 11-5, 11-9.
With Saturday’s triumph, Harvard improves to 10-4 all-time against the Yellowjackets.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team remains on top of the Ivy League after its first full weekend of conference play, thanks in large part to a career-high 30 points from sophomore forward Seth Towns Saturday night against Brown.
Although the Crimson (9-10, 4-0 Ivy League) will not play Penn and Princeton—currently second and third in the Ancient Eight respectively—for two weekends, the level of competition so far from Dartmouth, Yale, and Brown has demonstrated the challenges of winning on the road in the Ivy League. In its conference road wins, Harvard either trailed or led by just five or fewer points heading into the final minute of regulation.
The Crimson is currently in the midst of another extended stretch of road contests as it prepares to travel to Columbia and Cornell next weekend, having played 14 of 19 games away from Lavietes Pavilion so far this season. Saturday’s victory against the Bears marks a successful quarterly point for the Crimson as it looks ahead toward the remaining 10 conference matchups and potentially two tournament playoff games.
BRYCE BACK TO BRYCE
In sophomore Bryce Aiken’s second game back from injury, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker chose to increase his point guard’s minutes from 13 to 20. While Aiken was largely reserved to the role of a distributor and perimeter shooter Friday night against Yale, the former Ivy League Rookie of the Year targeted the interior on numerous possessions against Brown.
Despite only converting on three field goals, Aiken finished with 18 points by continuously attacking the paint and drawing fouls. Aiken shot 11-of-12 from the free throw line and committed just one turnover throughout the contest.
“Just hesitant, second-guessing my body obviously coming back [against Yale],” Aiken said. “But today I was much more comfortable definitely at what I could do on the court so just took what the defense gave me. My teammates put me in a good position to be successful.”
Aiken’s aggressiveness and playmaking finesse also increased spacing for his other teammates, something Towns credited postgame as a central reason to his own shooting success. While Aiken was on the court, Harvard converted on five of its 11 total game triples while Towns scored 12 of his 30 points.
However, Aiken’s Saturday performance was not entirely flawless. His troubles in guarding the Bears’ backcourt noticeably frustrated Amaker at several times during the contest. The coaching staff pleaded for Aiken to do a better job at staying in front of Brown freshman guard Desmond Cambridge and sophomore guard Brandon Anderson and avoid gambling for steals, but Aiken still appeared rusty on the defensive end.
Following a rookie season in which  Siyani Chambers ’17-’18 assumed more of the primary defensive responsibilities, Aiken will need to adjust well to an increased role if the Crimson is to be successful going forward.
A THREE-POINT RESURGENCE
The Crimson as a whole was also much more comfortable from three-point range, shooting over 60 percent. The mark was double its season average of 30.7 percent and a noticeable jump from the previous night against Yale, when the team combined for just 6-of-24 from three. Harvard’s current three-point shooting percentage is still last in the Ivies, but improved shooting from wings like sophomore Justin Bassey and junior Corey Johnson has paid important dividends for the team.
The star from deep was nevertheless Towns, who shot a perfect four-for-four from long range. The sophomore is averaging 14.7 points per game this season and is shooting over 43 percent from the three-point line. Consistency from deep is still a concern, as he shot just one-of-six against Yale and one-of-seven three games ago against Wofford.
Another small but critical contributor for Amaker’s squad Saturday night was freshman Danilo Djuricic, who delivered on a critical three in the final five minutes to draw the lead back out to double digits. With sophomore forward Chris Lewis in foul trouble throughout the entire game, Djuricic held up the interior throughout most of his 14 minutes of action.
“Big game for him in a situation which is pressurized,” Amaker said of Djuricic. “Coming through to meet passes against the press and a lot of little things that he did very well enabled us to come away with a victory.”

Are you already apprehensive about your fourth pset class? Are you looking for a fun—and potentially flirty—replacement? Are you a straight male? If you answered yes to these questions, listen up. Women and Gender Studies is the department for you. It’s such a good deal that it takes heterosexual male privilege to a whole new level.
That ratio, though
We know you were thinking it the second you read the article title, so let's get it out of the way. Sadly, not all straight men are woke enough to take a WGS class, so you will be one of few. Less competition in the room, more options for you. Enough said.
You always get into the class
WGS classes are very popular (among about half of the student population) and often involve a lottery or an application. Since you have an under-represented yet essential voice, it doesn’t matter what you say on your app. You’re getting into the class. No more shopping week woes for you.
Your privilege ensures that you haven't been exposed to the content (but you should be)
As you would learn in a WGS class, to have privilege means to enjoy unearned advantages without noticing. This class would a-woken you to the hardships you have never had to face. You would be making the world a better place, one ally at a time.
The bar is low for your comments
No women in the class expect you to have wise things to say about gender issues. If you say anything remotely wise, the many girls (see: ratio) will be very impressed. Be careful, though, because one misstep and you could be in trouble.
The WGS department needs you, but way more importantly, you need the WGS department.
