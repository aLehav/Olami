After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Naveen N. Srivatsa '12 will lead the newly-elected 138th Guard of The Harvard Crimson, the paper's outgoing president announced yesterday.
Srivatsa, an economics concentrator from Ramsey, N.J. and a Leverett House resident, is a news writer and blog executive who has covered house life at the College. He will assume the president's post in the beginning of January.
The paper's outgoing editors elected their successors early Friday morning, and the president of the 137th Guard, Peter F. Zhu '11, announced the results to the Crimson's staff soon after.
"The 138th Guard is tremendously talented and capable and has consistently demonstrated a great passion for the newspaper," Zhu said Saturday. "I am confident that their energy and enthusiasm will make them a highly productive group of leaders for The Crimson in the year ahead."
Srivatsa will be joined on the masthead by the managing editor-elect, Elias J. Groll '12, and the business manager-elect, Martin C. Ye '12.
The Crimson, founded in 1873, is the only daily newspaper in Cambridge, Mass., and the oldest continuously published daily college newspaper.
The Crimson chooses its leaders through an election process known as "the turkey shoot," in which all outgoing executives are invited to participate. A successful candidate must receive at least 75 percent of the vote.
Other newly-elected leaders include:
Eric P. Newcomer '12 and Noah S. Rayman '12, associate managing editors
Saieed Hasnoo '12, associate business manager
Punit N. Shah '12, director of web strategy
Susie Y. Kim '12 and Antonia M.R. Peacocke '12, arts chairs
Danielle Kim '12 and Gary L. Norris '12, design chairs
Anita J Joseph and James K. McAuley '12, editorial chairs
E.J. Bensing '14 and Sophie Chang '13, IT chairs
Mark J. Chiusano '12 and Elyssa A.L. Spitzer '12, magazine chairs
Kevin H. Lin '12 and Sara Joe Wolansky '12, photography chairs
Brian A. Campos '12 and Dennis J. Zheng '12, sports chairs
Andrew J. Petschek '12, video chair

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED 11/21/10, 11:34 p.m.
There may not have been an Ivy title on the line, but for the seniors of the Harvard football team (7-3, 5-2 Ivy), there was still a lot at stake.
In front of a sold-out crowd at Harvard Stadium, the Crimson seniors completed their four-year sweep of archrival Yale (7-3, 5-2) on Saturday afternoon, coming from behind to top the Bulldogs, 28-21, in the 127th playing of The Game.
“It means everything,” captain Collin Zych said. “It’s a great thing, and the Harvard-Yale game’s a great rivalry. To come out on top in such an emotional, physical game four years in a row is a great accomplishment.”
But Yale looked to be the dominant team in the first half, limiting Harvard’s offensive output to just 71 yards in the opening two quarters.
Bulldog quarterback Patrick Witt picked apart the secondary early and converted a key fourth-and-inches play on his second drive with a quarterback sneak.
Yale junior Alex Thomas then ran the ball in from two yards out to make the score 7-0 with just under six minutes to play in the first.
But the Crimson found a bit of an offensive groove late in the first quarter.
Junior quarterback Collier Winters threw a lateral to classmate Adam Chrissis, who pitched the ball back to Winters on a flea-flicker.
The quarterback followed up with a perfect pass to senior Marco Iannuzzi, who pulled in the catch despite being surrounded by three Yale defenders and brought the ball up to the five-yard line.
“Well, you know, me and Collier, we’ve been playing catch for quite a few years now,” said Iannuzzi, who was making his first appearance since the Lafayette game in early October. “When I saw the open space and I knew I had the trail on me, I just sort of thought the way that Collier would be thinking: throw it to the open space. I made that move, and he read it just the same. So I really felt that we were on the same page there, and it was a perfect ball.”
Four plays later, senior Gino Gordon was in the endzone to knot the score at seven.
The Crimson seemed to seize momentum 10 minutes into the second quarter, when the Bulldogs chose to go for another fourth-and-one conversion.
Witt handed the ball off to Yale back Mordecai Cargill, who was stuffed at the line of scrimmage and pushed back for a loss, turning the ball over on downs.
But a monster sack of Winters on third down brought out the Harvard punt team and gave the Bulldogs the ball at midfield.
Yale took advantage of that good field position, putting together a quick drive to set up Thomas with a two-yard run into the endzone with 13 seconds to go, giving the Bulldogs the advantage, 14-7, heading into the break.
The Crimson struck right back, wasting no time in the second half to even the score.
Iannuzzi received the kickoff at the 16-yard line, starting right before cutting left to find a seam. The returner broke far left at the 35-yard line and sprinted untouched into the endzone for his second kickoff return touchdown of the season.
“We were able to make some plays on special teams, where we kind of faltered last week,” Zych said. “That’s what it takes to win big games. For the most part, it’s very physical, very emotional, and there’s those couple of plays in a game where you gain an advantage. And we were fortunate to be on the right side of those today.”
But all of this physicality took a sour turn with 9:41 left to play in the third quarter, when another injury momentarily felled a Crimson star.
Zych laid a hit on Bulldog tight end Chris Blohm, forcing an incompletion, but the helmet-to-helmet blow sent the captain to the sideline. The senior returned late in the quarter.
“Coming off the field, I didn’t know if they were going to let me play anymore, so I wanted my teammates to know that I was still in the game, and I was going to do everything I could to get us the victory,” Zych said. “I was just so happy when they gave me back my helmet.”
Harvard’s defensive line was also ferocious in the third period, finally besting the Yale offensive line on a mid-quarter series.
Senior Josué Ortiz first burst through for a huge sack of Witt and then rushed up with classmate Chuks Obi and got a hand on Greg Carlsen’s punt to give Harvard the ball at the Bulldog 23.
Gordon capitalized with his best drive of the day, using several shifty runs to set up his own two-yard touchdown carry, giving the Crimson its first lead of the day at 21-14.
“I think a lot of it was just emotion,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said of his team’s third-quarter performance. “The big swing on the kickoff return, the big swing on the blocked punt. I mean obviously it gave us tremendous energy, enthusiasm, and we made the most of very few plays...We needed to make big plays, because we weren’t getting many opportunities.”
The Crimson continued to ride its momentum, putting pressure on Witt and not allowing Yale to get into a rhythm on offense.
Special teams continued to plague the Bulldogs, as Carlsen let off a dud punt that junior Dan Minamide returned to the Yale 36-yard line with just over 10 minutes to play in the game.
But another big head-to-head hit—this one coming from Bulldog outside linebacker Jesse Reising on Gordon—put both seniors on the ground. Gordon got up and walked off the field under his own power, but Reising left the field on a stretcher.
“My understanding is that he’s fine,” Yale coach Tom Williams said after the game. “A precautionary measure to take him off the field on a stretcher, but when he left the field he had feeling in all his extremeties.”
Reising’s injury put a damper on the proceedings, and both teams committed a series of penalties in the plays immediately after the hit. The Crimson eventually settled down, though, and Winters found junior Alex Sarkisian from 12 yards out for the 28-14 lead.
Harvard made a huge stop on a fourth-and-nine conversion that came up inches short but immediately coughed up the momentum when sophomore Treavor Scales fumbled the ball on the first play of the offensive series.
Yale took over at the 19-yard line, and the Crimson defense—spurred by senior Ryan Burkhead’s third sack of the afternoon—seemed to have stopped the Bulldogs short when junior Alex Gedeon picked off Witt at the goal line.
But the interception was nullified by a roughing the passer penalty, and Thomas notched his third touchdown of the game with a one-yard run to the right to make it a one-score game with 3:15 to play.
Although Yale threatened in the waning minutes, an offensive pass interference call effectively killed the visitors’ final drive, and Harvard sealed its 28-21 victory with a stop on fourth and long.
“Obviously, we’re disappointed,” Williams said. “We had expectations of winning the football game, and that’s why stats are misleading. You look at the stats, and we dominated in every area except on the scoreboard, but we did things that lose football games.”
The Bulldogs outgained the Crimson, 337 yards to 178, and had 19 first downs to Harvard’s 10. But the Crimson was a perfect three-of-three inside the red zone while holding Yale to three scores on seven chances inside the 20.
It was the fourth straight win in The Game for the Crimson, whose seniors graduate as the first class in Harvard history to go undefeated against Yale, Princeton, and Dartmouth over four years.
“It’s just been a world of emotions this past week, knowing you’ve been doing something since you were eight or nine years old, and it’s finally coming to an end,” Burkhead said. “To go out the way I did is a dream come true, and I’ll always remember the end of my career, of this game today.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball migrated south for the weekend, traveling to Macon, Ga. to take on Mercer this afternoon at the University Center.
The Crimson (2-1) picked up its second win of the young season, defeating the Bears (1-2), 75-69.
Harvard sophomore Christian Webster turned in a career performance in leading the Crimson to victory, notching 29 points on 8-of-12 shooting from the field and 3-of-4 shooting from beyond the arc.
But Webster wasn’t the only Harvard player lighting it up from deep. The Crimson shot a combined 42 percent from three-point land—its highest mark on the season—with sophomore Brandyn Curry and freshman Laurent Rivard chipping in with three three-pointers apiece.
Mercer, meanwhile, struggled from deep, shooting just 3-of-19 (19 percent).
Neither team was able to establish a lead in the opening minutes until the Crimson went on an 8-0 run midway through the first period to establish a 25-17 lead.
Webster sparked the run with 9:01 to play, sinking the first of three consecutive free throws. Curry followed with a three ball to put the Crimson up by six. Rivard capped off the run two minutes later with a jump shot.
Harvard went into the break up 10, 37-27, but the Bears came out on a tear to start the second. The home team evened the score at 39 less than four minutes into the second half, thanks to eight points from Mercer’s Jeff Smith, and then built a three-point lead with 15:24 to play.
But the Crimson managed to regain control of the contest over the next five minutes of play by relying on the three, accumulating a nine-point lead with 10:23 left. Harvard’s lead never dropped below six for the remainder of the contest, and the Crimson escaped the Peach State with the 75-69 win.
Webster, Curry, and Rivard were the only Harvard players to reach double-figure scoring, finishing with 29, 13, and 12, respectively. Junior co-captain Keith Wright—who entered the contest as the Crimson’s leading scorer, averaging 20 points per game—faced double teams all afternoon and was held to just three points on two shot attempts.

At a school that knows how to keep its secrets, Sherlock HUHDS is still trying to find the answers to life's persistent dining questions.
You may have seen posters of a sad lolcat throughout campus dining halls. Examination of the animal raises questions: What is this cat doing here? What could cause this cat so much distress?
Upon further investigation, we see that the caption on the poster reads, “I can haz my dishware bak? Plz?” The posters, put up by the Resource Efficiency Program, state that HUHDS spends $200,000 a year replacing dishware, which averages out to $30 per student. Other posters have taglines like "WANTED: Dishware" or pictures of Mrs. Potts and Chip.
These posters are part of a larger effort to stop student misuse of HUHDS dishware. “It's something that makes REP unhappy because lots of resources and energy go into producing the china and getting it to Harvard,” said REP representative Lila G. Brown '11.
REP coordinator Brandon P. Geller '08 told us that the issue isn’t really with breakage or general wear-and-tear, but with perfectly good dishware being thrown away. He said that students often forget about dishware that they bring back to their room. When they remember it again, they sometimes take the easy way out and throw it away.
“It’s at the point where food is moldy, so students either assume the plate is too gross to use again [...] or they’re too embarrassed to bring it back down.” Geller said. This is why REP does “amnesty dishware drives” in which students can bring their used dishes to a convenient spot (like the base of their entryway) to be picked up without facing punishment. (By the way, if you're curious, Geller said that cereal bowls have seen the worst losses across campus.)
According to Crista Martin, director of marketing and communication for HUHDS, the loss of dishware results in a cost of about $150,000 every year. "It is an unfortunate cost, with not just financial but environmental impacts, that could be reduced with help from the community,"  Martin wrote in an e-mailed statement. "Any money we don’t have to spend replacing dishes could instead be invested in the menu."
Dorm Crew members told us that, based on their observations, these concerns about unreturned dishware are not unfounded. "I’ve seen plenty of dishware in people’s rooms," said Alexis C. Gomez '13, a current Dorm Crew captain. "Last year in the entryway of Wigg, I noticed a pile mugs lined up against a window sill."
Patrick A. Jolicoeur '13, another dorm crew captain, said that he once counted 29 dining hall cups in one room. He added that because Dorm Crew isn’t responsible for returning dishes back to the dining hall, students should be more proactive in helping to solve this problem.
“I don’t know what can be done about this," he said. "I don’t think they should stop people from taking dishes out of the dining hall. The responsibility is really on the people to just bring them back.”

The Game is turning 127 years old tomorrow and the campus is anxiously awaiting the confrontation. It’s easy to get sucked into the excitement, but it might leave you to wonder how it all got started in the first place.
 
1. Blood Bath
The Game of 1894, the “Hampden Park Blood Bath,” suspended further rematches of The Game for three years after four players were brutally injured. Newspapers reported that the players were carried off the field "in dying condition.”
During the period, severe injuries, and sometimes even death, occurred because of physical formations such as the flying wedge, a charging technique that Harvard introduced in 1892. In the flying wedge, a large group of the offense united and charged at a similarly organized group of the defense. It resulted in severe injuries on both sides. This strategy was effectively banned in 1895.
2. You Fancy, Huh?
In 1928, the Harvard Club of Boston provided special train cars for the ride to New Haven. The train was “outfitted in a manner calculated to make for the utmost enjoyment of those travelling” by train, according to a Crimson article at the time. Lunch and dinner were served, and sleeping, parlor, and club cars were all part of the deal. Talk about keeping things classy.
3. Harvard = Drop outs?
In 1885, Harvard’s Committee on Athletics recommended to the Faculty that football be suspended because it “put a premium on unfair play because it is profitable when it succeeds and it is unlikely to be detected by the referee.” The Committee on Athletics found that “the team that plays a gentlemanly game against one playing an unfair game will always be beaten.” Harvard’s Faculty unanimously agreed and announced that inter-collegiate football would be prohibited for the future.
4. Harvard Beats Yale 29-29
On November 23, 1968, Harvard and Yale met face to face at Harvard Stadium. Yale was leading 29-13 with 10:44 remaining on the clock. After several offensive plays, Harvard had a two-point conversion in the final moments in the game. Even though it resulted in a tie, The Crimson declared victory with the headline, “Harvard Beats Yale 29-29.’’ This famous headline provided the inspiration for Kevin Rafferty’s documentary in 2008.
5. MIT Crashes
Student pranks have happened at The Game, but many of the pranks aren’t even by Harvard or Yale, but by MIT! Known for their bizarre, engineering-driven stunts to disrupt The Game, MIT students found a way to embed a big weather balloon that automatically inflated midfield in 1982. And in 2006, male MIT students streaked across the football field during the Harvard-Yale game with "MIT" painted on their backs.

This post has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: November 21, 2010
An  earlier version of the Nov. 20 FlyBy post "Looking Back at  Harvard-Yale" incorrectly reported that the MIT balloon prank occurred  in 1892. The correct year is 1982.

The weekend of The Game has a reputation of being a weekend of drinks, partying, and fun, and there will likely be students who consume more than a safe amount of alcohol and who need to seek medical attention.
Harvard has a policy that grants amnesty to those who seek care for themselves or their friends if they're under the influence of drugs or alcohol, but what about students from Yale?
Ryan M. Travia, director of Alcohol and Other Drug Services, said in an e-mailed statement provided by a spokeswoman that Yale students would not be treated any differently in terms of Harvard's amnesty policy, and Benjamin S. Flores, student affairs fellow at Yale, said that Yale would not punish its students for seeking medical care.
"Yale will generally only discipline a student for doing something that it would punish the student for whether they were under the influence or not,” Flores said. “You won’t be disciplined for the act of intoxication in and of itself if you seek medical help.”
