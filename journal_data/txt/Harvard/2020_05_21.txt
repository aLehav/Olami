After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Mrs. America” tells the story of Phyllis Schlafly, a conservative activist and writer whose grassroots campaign against the Equal Rights Amendment mobilized antifeminist women nationwide, ultimately preventing its ratification. It’s an immensely interesting historical moment, one wherein a conservative backlash movement rose up to counter second-wave feminism, making celebrities out of figureheads from both sides. The project of the show seems to be providing a “balanced” retelling of history rather than an honest one, and in doing so, it avoids criticizing Schlafly’s obvious hypocrisy and moral contradictions, while zeroing in on problems within the liberal feminist movement. In this sense, the show fails at providing a real glimpse of the historical moment — it focuses on a privileged group of elite women trying to prevent liberal change, yet never reckons with the real impact of their actions.
The show is superficially charming, drawing readers into an unlikely grassroots movement led by the calculating Schlafly (played, magnetically, by Cate Blanchett). Schlafly juggles her duties as a mother, society woman, and aspiring politician with robotic ease, cultivating an unnervingly cold charisma. The audience soon sees that even as she rails against the feminist movement, she struggles under the same strictures they’re working against —  she’s ambitious and wants to become a political power player, yet she is constantly forced to minimize her goals to appease her husband and maintain her image as a good housewife. Blanchett’s Schlafly seems wracked with repressed rage — toward sexist male politicians, her dismissive husband, and her competitive fellow homemakers — in addition to being blatantly opportunistic. Viewers see that she disregards the ERA, preferring to write about national security, until she realizes that she can use the ERA to make a name for herself.
Blanchett gives a captivating performance, and the show’s stellar cast delivers nuanced characters across the board, portraying a refreshing range of interesting, complex women. The show’s elaborate sets and impeccable costumes make for an immersive viewing experience, ushering the audience into the show’s competing worlds — the pristine, preppy mansions of suburban homemakers and the gritty, bustling offices of feminist activists.
Ultimately, though, “Mrs. America’s” overt focus on the aesthetics of the era distracts from the radical right-wing substance of Schlafly’s work, romanticizing her as an unrecognized, unconventional political genius living in a fast-moving era of female empowerment. Eager to pull the reader into the cultural moment of the seventies, the show uses psychedelic rock songs to score scenes of Schlafly campaigning against feminist progress. Yet the real Phyllis Schlafly wanted nothing to do with the progressive artistic movements or music of the seventies and was actively working against the cultural moment to engineer a traditionalist backlash. The show’s preoccupation with groovifying her reactionary movement seems forced and unrealistic.
Further, in building Schlafly up as a feminist antihero, the show simplifies and glorifies her origins, portraying her as a lifelong housewife with political ambitions who miraculously creates an underdog movement. In reality, at the time of her work against the ERA, she wasn’t simply a onetime failed Congressional candidate — she had written a bestselling book in support of Barry Goldwater’s presidential campaign, run for president of the National Federation of Republican Women, and founded a national Catholic anti-Communist organization. “Mrs. America” ignores her connection to established conservative groups and networks to portray her as a kitchen-table organizer, building a movement by humbly typing her homemade newsletter and hosting meetings in her cutesy, pastel-toned living room.
The show buries the reality of Schlafly’s work behind a facade of suburban pageantry and glamorized appearances, painting anti-ERA advocates as earnest housewives rather than naive agents of misogyny. Their tactic of sending homemade loaves of bread to male lawmakers (“from the breadmakers to the breadwinners”) to encourage them to vote against the ERA is portrayed as a stroke of genius rather than the self-denigrating reversion to antiquated gender roles that it is.
Further, Schlafly and her friends are depicted as dedicated housewives, underappreciated by feminists and their husbands alike — yet in the background of their conversations, Schlafly’s housekeeper, a working-class Black woman whom Schlafly routinely disrespects, does the unglamorous work of maintaining the household, caring for the children, and preparing meals. The show subtly hints at the hypocrisy of this setup — but considering that the show is overtly on-the-nose in other regards, such as in its depiction of the sexism Schlafly faces from men, this weak mention of the issue is not enough. Again and again, the show tries to humanize Schlafly and her fellow conservative white women by portraying the difficulties they face in a misogynistic society — meanwhile, their comfortable, sheltered lives are propped up by unseen working-class people who couldn’t afford to live the stay-at-home life Schlafly promotes. Their deeply sheltered outlook is only pointed out in passing by feminist figures like Gloria Steinem (Rose Byrne), whose movement the show is eager to criticize as divided and ineffectual.
“Mrs. America” skirts around the sensationalist Schlafly and her cohort’s rhetoric, only occasionally (and lazily) questioning her baseless claims that the ERA would get women drafted into the army and end alimony. The show’s liberals only defend the bill by saying it’s basically symbolic. The show, then, implies that Schlafly’s victory over the ERA only deprived America of another symbolic law, rather than killing an amendment that would have prevented sex discrimination in marriage laws and outlawed gender discimination in the military, among myriad benefits that might have come from a decree of equality.
Furthermore, “Mrs. America” tries to portray Schlafly as a pragmatist who looks down upon racist southerners in her organization. While the real-life Schlafly was indifferent toward civil rights issues, she repeatedly allied with racist lawmakers like Senator Sam Ervin, a notorious Jim Crow advocate, hardly making her an advocate against racism within her political circles. Later in her life, she went public with a series of political opinions that reveal that she wasn’t just saying what she needed in order to achieve her goals; she was a genuine right-wing idealist who spoke out against gay marriage, immigration, abortion, the concept of marital rape, and even U.S. participation in the United Nations.
The underlying logic of the show is that Schlafly was a smart woman facing ubiquitous sexism, so STOP ERA was unfortunately (but reasonably!) the only way for her to get ahead. She found a creative, if not unsavory, way to succeed in a man’s world — and isn’t that understandable, perhaps even impressive? The answer is no. This apologist logic could be extended to any number of horrifically destructive historical leaders — but to what end? No amount of context can justify Schlafly’s destructive agenda.
“Mrs. America” is impressively acted and designed, with stars delivering moving performances in beautiful sets. Its competence, however, can’t save it from the filmmakers’ alienating eagerness to find the likable qualities in Schlafly, ignoring the real damage she did.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Tonight is not a fundraiser, so put your wallets away,” Lady Gaga said to her viewers prior to the start of the World Health Organization and Global Citizen’s “One World: Together at Home” event, hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Fallon, and Stephen Colbert. “It is our love letter to the world.”
The two-hour event was broadcast on every network and platform under the sun, including NBC, ABC, CBS, YouTube, Prime Video, and Twitch. It was curated by Lady Gaga herself. The event also raised $127.9 million through commitments by corporations and philanthropists for the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund for the World Health Organization, but it urged its viewers not to donate. Instead, Lady Gaga suggested they take the time to thank essential workers, and to take certain actions online instead — such as calling a representative or signing a petition.
Before the broadcast, Global Citizen (an organization that works by rewarding “global citizens” for taking actions on their platform, such as signing petitions or posting on social media) streamed six hours of additional performances and celebrity calls to stay strong and to continue to practice social distancing. “One World: Together at Home” featured musicians of all genres and from all parts of the globe, from Paul McCartney to Burna Boy. In between the short, filmed-from-home performances, celebrities and major figures, such as Bill Gates, who Colbert introduced as “Melinda Gates’s husband,” and Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, would give thanks to essential workers and health care professionals while urging viewers to stay home as much as possible.
“We got to take care of our health care workers and frontline by buying them time, by taking care of ourselves,” Matthew McConaughey urged during the event.
Lady Gaga kicked off the show by saying, “I care so much about all of the medical workers…. I think of them every day, I pray for them everyday, and I’m thinking of all of you at home…. What I want to do tonight, if I can, is to give you permission, just for a moment, to ‘smile, if your heart is breaking.’” Then she started singing Nat King Cole’s “Smile” from her piano at home. As with many of the performances, Gaga’s felt incredibly intimate as she sang directly to the camera and directly into her viewers’ living rooms.
The broadcast, along with its dozens of celebrity hosts and performers, drove its message of gratitude home by including individual stories of healthcare workers around the world. Among them was Dr. Sanam Ahmed from Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, who attempted to give hope to viewers whose loved ones were currently suffering from Covid-19.
“I want people to know that if you can’t hold your mom’s hand, I’m there to hold her hand, and to tell your family that you love them and you care for them,” she said.
These sentiments were echoed by all the health care workers featured, who all cited their sense of responsibility to their communities and their families as a driving factor in their fight against the coronavirus. Other experts, too, were brought in to discuss the intersectionality of the pandemic — such as intersections with homelessness, class, mental health, race, and ethnicity — thus exemplifying a critical choice on the part of Global Citizen to include viewpoints that stem beyond the middle and upper-class narratives that dominate coronavirus coverage and policy.
Still, the program featured some questionable choices. Amid the performances and testimonies from heroes on the front lines were pathos-driven messages by major corporations like Coca-Cola and Verizon. Though the messages depicted their efforts to aid in the coronavirus pandemic, they felt out of place, detracting from the event’s focus on the heroes on the ground.
The Rolling Stones’ performance of “You Can’t Always Get What You Want,” too, was interesting. Though musically, it was flawless— with Mick Jagger, Ronnie Wood, and Keith Richards all on guitar — drummer Charlie Watts was placed in a rather peculiar circumstance, made to air drum on screen rather than play live. While this may be attributed to concerns of keeping tempo while streaming a performance, it made it so that once one noticed, one could do little else but pity Watts for having to pretend he was playing a cymbal and not the arm of his blue couch.
Highlights of the night included Stevie Wonder’s touching tribute to his “friend, the late Bill Withers,” Lizzo’s heartfelt rendition of “A Change Is Gonna Come,” and Keith Urban’s performance of “Higher Love,” in which he played with a “band” made up of different videos of himself in different parts of his large studio space — reminding viewers of the dramatic changes that the pandemic has necessitated of the music industry. Jimmy Fallon and The Roots, too, shared an uplifting re-writing of Men Without Hats’ 1982 hit, “Safety Dance.” “We can dance, everybody’s washing their hands,” Fallon sang, as videos of health care workers dancing and singing along took up the screen. In a broadcast which had focused, rightly, on the pain and challenges wrought by the pandemic, the playful performance was refreshing and hopeful.
The last performance of the night was especially touching. Vocal powerhouses Celine Dion and Andrea Bocelli were joined by Lady Gaga and concert pianist Lang Lang for an emotional performance of “The Prayer” in both English and Italian. The performance — for its combination of the musicians’ skill and perfect song choice — was stellar. The star-studded performance, shown on the screen as four different live-streams, was reminiscent of the 1985 USA for Africa performance of “We Are the World,” which also made use of the celebrity status of its singers to raise awareness.The performance was the perfect way to end a night of music and solidarity, no doubt leaving its viewers awestruck at its beauty.
“On behalf of myself and the thousands of Jimmy’s hosting tonight, we want to thank Global Citizen for making this show possible,” host Stephen Cobert said at the end of the event.
“And thank you for brushing your teeth. You didn’t need to do that but we appreciate it,” Jimmy Kimmel added. With that, the screen went black, a proverb glowing in the place of the three comedians: “For tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Given that author Sally Rooney’s style is so reliant on interiority, adapting a cherished book like “Normal People” for television is bound to be difficult. BBC Three/Hulu’s adaptation of the novel recognizes this, and doesn’t make the mistake of directly recreating the inner workings of her characters’ minds through voiceover. Instead, the series entrusts its phenomenal lead actors, Daisy Edgar-Jones and Paul Mescal, to anchor this intimate and beautiful narrative. By focusing on the pair entirely, directors Lenny Abrahamson and Hettie Macdonald deliver an in-depth, delicate portrayal of the novel’s beloved characters.
Though tonally very different from the book, the show largely remains faithful to its source material. It doesn’t hurt that Rooney herself was involved with the script, working with Alice Birch and Mark O’Rowe to adapt the series. It focuses on wealthy, oddball Marianne Sheridan (Edgar-Jones) and shy but popular football player Connell Waldron (Mescal), the smartest students attending a secondary school in Ireland’s rural county Sligo. Despite the two not speaking in school, Connell frequently comes into contact with Marianne, as his mother Lorraine (Sarah Greene) works as a cleaner for Marianne’s family. Connell and Marianne soon begin a secret relationship, bonding over their academic aspirations and similar political beliefs. Connell’s embarrassment to be seen with Marianne sows the seeds for a tumultuous relationship that will carry on over the years as the couple falls in and out of love, largely due to miscommunication and warped power dynamics. The series follows them to Dublin once they begin university studies and date other people.
Early trailers for the show promised viewers a steamy succession of episodes — and the show delivers. At first, the montages of sex appear a touch sensational. Certainly, the novel contains a lot of it, but Sally’s simple, lush prose never gets into robust graphic detail. Watching it on screen, however, is a completely different experience, especially given how visceral the team has made the scenes.
Ultimately, the early sex scenes justify themselves. The close-up loving shots of the couple locked in the throes of passion serve as a testament to how connected the two are on a physical level — a major concern in Rooney’s writing. Adding to the rawness of these moments are the sharp sounds, from the tender kissing down to a condom being unrolled. These details welcome the viewer into an intimate space, one that they’re not sure they were ready for.
“Normal People” initially follows Connell and Marianne’s story chronologically, but after they start university, the show begins to emulate the book’s time jumps. It often shows a present day moment in the first minutes of the episode, then goes back in time to show those days leading up to it. This turns out to be a clever choice; the time changes and flashbacks pay off later in the series.
Since the show is so focused on establishing the sexual chemistry early on, later episodes like episode eight where Connell joins Marianne and her abusive boyfriend Jamie (Fionn O'Shea) in Italy, explore their mental connection a lot more thoroughly. When not in a relationship, the show gives more weight and insight onto their conversations and political opinions.
In a way, Rooney’s unique style makes her characters embody one organism: It is as if they give up their souls to be part of a Sally Rooney Leviathan. In the show, Connell and Marianne are clearly cut from the same cloth, but their individual perspectives are emphasized. This is bolstered by Edgar-Jones’ and Mescal’s respective performances. Much of the stars’ acting relies on what is not said, so their relationship continues to make use of close up shots of their eye contact, which both actors accomplish wonderfully. Given how particularly silent Connell is, Mescal also channels his characters’ thoughts through intense facial expressions and using only the barest of movements to convey his concerns. Mescal’s acting is particularly moving in a scene in which Connell breaks down before a therapist.
Marianne is an incredible amalgamation of vulnerability, rebellion, and elegance. Edgar-Jones captures every one of these sides with sensitivity. Though the show chooses to give us the merest glance into Marianne’s abusive family life, the talented actress manages to give more insight through her controlled tone of voice, which helps the viewer to understand her character’s self-destructive tendencies.
By choosing to focus as much as it can on the main characters’ development, “Normal People” successfully explores the power dynamic between the couple. It tracks the constant shifts in financial and sexual dominance in their relationship, using details like Connell’s imposter syndrome toward Trinity and Marianne’s sophisticated, lavish lifestyle to signify changes. The Marxist undertones of the novel translate well to the screen, often relying on the side characters to deliver Rooney’s class commentary: Jamie is the pinnacle example of this. O'Shea depicts Jaime’s careless elitism and purposeful cruelty with striking accuracy and viciousness.
Those who have not read the book might find themselves confused by how side characters are glossed over, but ultimately this doesn’t detract much at all from the entire experience. The show’s intense focus on Marianne and Connell more than makes up for the series' other small faults. In the end, their relationship is a complex, painful journey and by devoting all its energy to it, the show is a triumph.

Mindy Kaling has already given us so much. From her work as a writer and actress on the “The Office” to creating and starring in the “The Mindy Project,” she has undoubtedly secured her place in the modern comedic canon. But her new show, “Never Have I Ever,” co-created with Lang Fisher, might be her most meaningful contribution to television yet.
Drawing in part from Kaling’s own childhood, the Netflix series follows Devi (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan), a studious 15-year-old Indian American girl in Sherman Oaks, California, who wants to use her sophomore year of high school to elevate her social status. After a traumatizing freshman year, involving both the death of her father at an orchestra concert and the subsequent psychosomatic paralysis of her legs that confined her to a wheelchair for three months, Devi wants to prove that she is not someone to be pitied. Determined to reach high school social milestones instead of confronting her grief, Devi’s journey is a witty and heartwarming depiction of the intersection between coming of age and coping with loss.
“Can she shed her identity as the paralyzed Indian girl whose dad dropped dead at a school function?” asks tennis legend John McEnroe, who narrates the series as himself — a casting choice that might sound strange, yet manages to come off as refreshingly funny and fitting. Whether or not Gen Z viewers will be familiar with his career as a tennis player, McEnroe anchors the show with his quippy and insightful narrations.
Part of Devi’s attempt to “shed her identity” is her goal to have sex with swim team jock Paxton Hall-Yoshida (Darren Barnet), aka Paxton H-Y, the hottest guy in the San Fernando Valley. Her brazen pursuit of Paxton — “I was wondering if you would ever...consider having sex with me?” she says to him in their first ever conversation — guides the arc of the series. The show’s unabashed dialogue, along with its smart humor and playful pop culture references keep it well-paced and entertaining. The jokes also appeal to multiple generations of viewers, with Devi reading Anna Todd’s Harry Styles inspired novel “After” in one episode, and McEnroe referencing the 1970s band The Doobie Brothers in another.
In “Never Have I Ever,” typical high school plot conventions are creatively rewritten and brought to life by emotionally resonant characters. Devi is a delightfully nuanced protagonist; multifaceted and well-developed, there’s a part of her that everyone can identify with. She is fiery and obstinate, but still sensitive and insecure, traits realized by Ramakrishnan’s lively acting. Devi’s two best friends, Fabiola (Lee Rodriguez) and Eleanor (Ramona Young) have their own issues, one struggling with her sexuality and the other with an absentee mother, but they aren’t quite as dynamic or sympathetic as Devi. Still, every character in the especially diverse cast feels worthy of investing time in, from Devi’s academic rival Ben Gross (Jaren Lewison), who gets his own episode narrated by Andy Samberg, to Devi’s cousin Kamala (Richa Moorjani), who feels conflicted about her impending arranged marriage. Devi has a tense relationship with her strict mom, Nalini (Poorna Jagannathan), and it would be easy to depict her as an unlikable antagonist; instead her mother’s grief and experiences as an immigrant are explored just as thoroughly as Devi’s hardships. All of the characters are presented as undeniably human — they are complicated, imperfect people rather than flatly written clichés — making them inherently relatable.
“Never Have I Ever” also provides a thoughtful, if not all encompassing, depiction of Indian and Indian American culture, particularly apparent in the episode “...Felt Super Indian,” which was written by Kaling and follows Devi and her family as they celebrate the Hindu holiday Ganesh Puja. This episode showcases Devi’s ambivalence toward her identity, as she feels caught between her Indian heritage and her American upbringing, effectively capturing a feeling many first-generation Americans can relate to. “I don’t really feel at home right now in my choice of clothing,” she says about her sari, before finding herself reconsidering and embracing her culture by the end of the cleverly-written and introspective episode.
There are so many aspects of “Never Have I Ever” that make it worth watching, from the hilarity of John McEnroe to the irresistibility of Paxton H-Y, but it is Devi’s struggle with her grief that differentiates the series from Mindy Kaling’s other comedic projects. Her eventual acceptance of her father’s death is portrayed with poignance and grace, and more tender-hearted viewers might find themselves fighting back tears during the final episode, which is touching but never cloying. It’s difficult to write and execute a show that so delicately balances the lighthearted with the profound, but “Never Have I Ever” does so with ease. It reinvigorates the coming-of-age genre with its flawed-but-lovable characters and realistic storylines, leaving viewers longing for season two before they’ve even reached the finale.

Millennials may not earn the title of “greatest generation,” but we have most certainly earned the moniker “first generation.” We are the first to have every stage of our life upended by the powerful and modern mix of climate change, digitization, and globalization — let’s call this the connected world.
As the first generation to grow up in this connected world, we bear the biggest responsibility to take action. Our lived experiences have made clear that the structures and systems of previous generations are ill-suited for the problems of today and for the rest of our tomorrows. We cannot afford to pass the responsibility to reform and update our way of life and system of government to future generations — they are already depending on us.
A glimpse at the last calendar year exemplifies the millennial tradition of being the first to mature in the connected world. For example, my classmates at the Harvard Kennedy School and I have had campus disrupted by unpredictable weather, political protests, and, now, a pandemic. Generations of students have dealt with these issues before, but never in such rapid succession and to such a significant and unpredictable degree.
The chaos of the connected world and the limits of aged institutions and systems are on full display within the walls of a modern classroom. Crazy weather induced, in part, by climate change exposed how so many public buildings are far from ready to withstand the pressures of severe storms — in California, for example, several days of class were canceled at Bay Area schools due to power outages caused by the threat of wildfires. And, sadly, this is just the beginning of institutions attempting to function normally in abnormal conditions.
Our daily exposure to the shortfalls of infrastructure designed decades ago requires increased reliance on digital tools that at once empower us to pursue new opportunities while exposing us to new threats. Case in point: I took the majority of my classes this semester from the comfort (and isolation) of my living room. The convenience of the modern age at once frees us to pursue every whim and explore every idea while simultaneously making it easier to recede from one another, from the communities we need to engage with in order to solve the problems that lie ahead.
COVID-19, doubtless exacerbated by globalization, has accelerated our collective separation from one another. Though the motives behind social isolation are necessary in this context, globalization has generally made it too easy to become self-reliant. As a result, our social fabric is stretched thin — pulled by the forces of one-touch purchases that allow you to never meet the store owner down the street, pressured by social media that pulls your attention away from local issues, and pummeled by new business models that make employees cogs in a global system rather than contributors to community wellbeing.
Restoring and retooling our social fabric and institutions for the modern age is the biggest challenge for the first generation. But I’m optimistic that millennials and other young Americans can rise to the challenge. Though many of the events of recent times have caught us off guard, millennials — especially those in places with as much social and intellectual capital as Harvard — are also the first generation equipped with tools to source knowledge from around the world. We are the first generation to be able to communicate instantly with anyone, nearly anywhere.
And yet we are the first generation in the modern era to not feel assured that tomorrow will be a better day. That lack of assurance should be all the motivation we need to get our act together and rise above petty politics, intolerable inequality, and the ridiculous idea that anyone has the right answer.
Tomorrow will bring even more uncertainty than today. Thankfully, millennials are familiar with this chaos. That’s why I think young Americans are ready to update our communities and institutions to become more resilient and united in this connected world.

Coronavirus has disrupted University life in myriad ways, transforming how we learn, conduct research, and foster connections with each other. In recent weeks, classes shifted to remote instruction, libraries closed, and Harvard froze its hiring processes. Many things have changed, but one hasn’t: Harvard has not granted extensions to its non-tenure-track faculty, many of whom will “time out” at the end of the academic year in the midst of a pandemic.
As of Wednesday, Harvard has not responded to a petition signed by over 1300 Harvard affiliates that began to circulate over a month ago. The petition calls on the University to extend appointments for non-tenure track faculty by at least one year. Many faculty who will “time out” at the end of June will lose their income in an uncertain job market and be left without healthcare in the middle of a deadly pandemic.
As students from concentrations that rely on non-tenure-track faculty for instruction, we strongly urge Harvard to respond to this petition with action: extend appointments for non-tenure track faculty by at least one year.
Within a week after we evacuated campus and transitioned to remote instruction, Harvard announced that it would give tenure track faculty the opportunity to extend their current appointments and postpone promotion reviews. In a March email to the faculty, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay wrote that the circumstances of the pandemic would affect faculty’s “time and productivity” in research, teaching, and their advising roles, among other factors.
Faculty includes non-tenure-track faculty. As Gay acknowledged, all faculty were faced with unique burdens with regards to their multiple roles as researchers, teachers, and advisers, but non-tenure-track faculty were left conspicuously unprotected. Harvard did the right thing in extending appointments for tenure-track faculty. But by that logic, non-tenure-track faculty — who in fall 2019 taught more than half of undergraduates — deserve the same support.
Non-tenure-track faculty are essential to the architecture of this school. More than 200 received teaching awards in fall 2018. They have fundamentally shaped our academic experiences at Harvard through thoughtful seminars, senior thesis advising, and valuable mentorship across disciplines such as Mathematics, History & Literature, Social Studies, Environmental Science and Public Policy, Romance Languages and Literatures, and other fields in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Though some individual departments have already extended appointments due to curricular need, it is ultimately the responsibility of the administration to protect all of its faculty.
In addition to the more than 1300 people who signed the Harvard-specific petition, thousands of scholars across academic institutions worldwide have pledged to withhold attendance at speaking engagements, workshops, and conferences at universities that do not extend appointments for non-tenure-track faculty for the 2020-2021 academic year. Among them are prominent legal scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw, philosopher Judith Butler, novelist and creative writing professor Zadie Smith, and Nobel Prize-winning scientist Harold E. Varmus.
Importantly, extending appointments would provide much-needed continuity and stability for students as well as faculty during a particularly unstable time marked by a distinct lack of access to on-campus resources. Harvard’s academic environment thrives because new scholars come every year to bring new and diverse perspectives to teaching and learning. That said, in the middle of the crisis, we believe both new faculty and students would be better supported with a team of experienced educators on hand to ease the burdens of pandemic teaching. Rising seniors, for example, would have the opportunity to write theses with lecturers and other instructors they know well. Students on the whole will benefit from maintaining the support of their advisers and mentors as Harvard faces an uncertain future.
Undergraduates from different disciplines across the College agree on the importance of protecting non-tenure-track faculty; 107 of them have signed on to this op-ed in support. As students, we believe that ensuring Harvard’s continued academic success amid unprecedented circumstances requires its leadership to extend the appointments of those best prepared to weather the storm. These advisers and instructors have shaped our academic trajectories in college. They have played a critical role in our shift to online learning. They have worked tirelessly to help us complete our final papers and exams. Under these dire circumstances, it is imperative for the University to protect the Harvard community — and that includes the livelihoods of its non-tenure-track faculty.

Harvard Law School announced Wednesday it will offer its online, pre-term “Zero-L” course for free for all United States law schools this summer in an effort to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the success of incoming law students.
The Law School and the Office of the Vice Provost for Advances in Learning created the Zero-L program in 2018 to ensure students from all backgrounds could enter the school with foundational knowledge about the legal field. The name Zero-L refers to the names of 1L, 2L, and 3L for first, second, and third-year law students.
The program is taught by Law School professors and features self-paced modules that students can refer back to throughout their entire first year. It covers topics such as how to read a case and the stages of civil litigation.
Law School Professor I. Glenn Cohen, who serves as Zero-L’s faculty director, told Harvard Law Today — a Law School-run publication — that the decision was prompted by concerns that many incoming law students might be struggling to prepare for the fall due additional responsibilities imposed by the pandemic, such as caring for sick relatives or financially supporting their families.
“Given all this, and knowing we had an excellent course with a demonstrated ability to help students start law school, making it freely available this year seemed like a small thing HLS could do for law students and law schools across the country to try to make the Fall 2020 just a little bit easier,” he said.
In 2019, four other law schools — Seton Hall University, Northeastern University, Boston College, and the University of Baltimore — adopted the program.
The Law School had planned to make the Zero-L program available to other schools for a fee, but decided to waive that fee in light of the pandemic. All law schools in the United States who wish to participate can offer the course to their incoming students starting July 1.
This year, the course will also cover material typically included in law school orientation, providing supplemental materials for schools that are currently making the shift to virtual orientations due to the pandemic.
Cohen also noted in Harvard Law Today that the Law School has not eliminated the possibility of reinstating the fee in future years. The school will, however, make a portion of Zero-L focused on American civics free and available to the public on HarvardX permanently.
Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 — who oversaw the original launch of Zero-L at the Law School — said in a press release that his own experience as a first-generation student has informed his understanding of the program’s importance.
“When I arrived at HLS as a first-year student, I felt very much out of my depth in those crucial first weeks,” he said in a press release. “Like a lot of other new law students, I felt that everyone around me ‘got it,’ and I just didn’t.”
Law School student Mara L. Chin Loy said in the release that the Zero-L program helped her feel well-prepared for her first semester in law school, adding that as a human biology major at Stanford, she did not understand how law school would work before taking the course.
“I was able to fully focus my time on learning the material in my class, as opposed to spending a few weeks trying to figure out what was even going on,” she wrote.

Roughly a month before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Harvard representatives gathered at the City Hall Annex to present the University’s latest campus projects to Cambridge Planning Board members in the annual Town Gown meeting.
While giving an overview of recent initiatives, Harvard’s director of planning services Alexandra J. Offiong said the University hoped to be a “good neighbor” by ensuring projects for its own development did not encroach upon city guidelines and values.
However, more than three months later, the idea of “good neighbor” has taken on an entirely different meaning in the wake of the pandemic — shifting from one of non-disruptive behavior to generous support.
For Cambridge, a city typically home to roughly 40,000 University affiliates, the success of the non-academic — “town” — and the academic — “gown” — populations is inseparable. And as the virus forces retailers to close and students to evacuate, the city of Cambridge must rely more heavily on the University to weather the pandemic.
Residents, students, and city officials have called on the University to offer a portion of its endowment to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus. While it has not directly answered these calls, Harvard has provided infrastructure and other resources to the city.
In early March, Denise A. Jillson, the executive director of Harvard Square Business Association, recalled walking through Massachusetts Avenue and Brattle Street, where tourists, students, and residents frequently came to shop and dine.
New retailers like outdoor clothing supplier Patagonia and new eateries like California-based Veggie Grill had just settled into the Square. At the time, some of the biggest challenges these stores faced were attracting visitors amid online shopping’s increasing popularity and rising rent prices.
Two months later, nearly all Square businesses have shuttered due to the coronavirus outbreak. The streets themselves are devoid of traffic, presenting major economic costs for their owners.
Jillson estimates that out of the 292 businesses in Harvard Square, fewer than 20 remain open in mid-May. She said retailers are no longer attempting to combat the growth of online shopping. Rather, they are using it to help their businesses survive.
“In January, [we were] trying to focus on educating the public about how important it is for them to walk into the Square,” she said.
“The irony of it all was not lost on me,” she added.
As businesses experience major financial losses due to the stay-at-home advisory, owners occupying University-owned spaces have received aid from both the city and Harvard to stay afloat.
Jillson said even before the pandemic, the University was a “benevolent property owner,” often subsidizing rent below market rates and donating amenities like tables and umbrellas to the city and HSBA.
The University has furthered its efforts to support small business owners who lease its property in light of the pandemic, according to Meredith Weenick, the vice president for campus services.
Weenick said the University has reached out to its tenants to address their individual concerns. Based on each small business tenant’s situation during the pandemic, the University has offered “different rent-relief options” and “minimum-sales guarantees.”
Following the announcement that students would be required to vacate campus and continue their semesters online, Harvard also lifted its “lease requirements for mandatory minimum operating hours,” per Weenick.
As states issued stay at home advisories, University and city officials looked for places to house the homeless in Cambridge. With the closure of local shelters like the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter just weeks after pandemic reached Massachusetts, officials turned to alternative methods of housing.
Harvard and MIT donated $250,000 each to fund the construction of an emergency homeless shelter at the War Memorial Recreation Center, housed within the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School.
In the announcement, Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui and City Manager Louis A. DePasquale praised the universities for their “extraordinary generosity” and deemed the War Memorial Center an “appropriate safe location” for the homeless population.
Other city officials called on the schools to provide more resources. City Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan penned a petition challenging both Harvard and MIT to donate more aid and resources than a quarter-million-dollar donation.
In his petition — which has been signed by over 600 city and University affiliates — Zondervan criticized Harvard and MIT for getting away with “the bare minimum,” when “physical space” was most needed.
The petition urged the universities to house homeless residents in dorm rooms vacated by students who were sent home.
“These funds are not nearly enough, and what is much more critically needed is physical space to provide safe housing for everyone who needs to be physically isolated, including all community members currently experiencing homelessness,” the petition read.
Harvard spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke declined to comment specifically on the University’s decision to not house homeless individuals in dormitories. She also noted that the University made the Harvard Square Hotel available to house Cambridge first responders near hospitals and health care facilities.
DePasquale said he was grateful for the provisions in a press release.
“Having unfettered access to all the rooms at the Harvard Square Hotel will allow our health care workers and first responders a safe place to stay in close proximity to our emergency facilities,” DePasquale wrote. “It alleviates stress for both our frontline workers and their families during a very anxious time for everyone involved.”
Harvard has also offered campus facilities — especially areas with easily-accessible restrooms and office space — to assist with health care operations, according to the Harvard Gazette.
Beyond providing infrastructure and economic support to combat the effects of the virus, the University has invested in programs to improve education and health outcomes during the pandemic.
With Cambridge and Boston public schools forced to adapt to remote learning for the remainder of the school year, Harvard Business Publishing hosted a session over Zoom to offer teachers tools to improve online education, with approximately 9,000 educators in attendance.
Harvard also distributed approximately 20,000 copies of curriculum-tailored packets for students at all grade levels in the BPS system, Maile Takahashi, the University’s Director for Community Programming, said in an interview with the Harvard Gazette.
The University and its affiliates have also provided personal protective equipment from their facilities, with professors donating gloves, masks, lab coats, and eye guards. The school’s Environmental Health and Safety team gathered the supplies to be distributed to hospitals, health care workers, and state agencies.
In addition to providing physical resources, University affiliates in diverse areas of expertise — including infectious disease, immunology, health care provider wellness, emergency management, and economics — have advised local officials.
The University also connected faculty members to elected officials and community leaders, according to Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 in an interview with the Gazette.
In late March, the city of Cambridge announced its COVID-19 Expert Advisory Panel, appointed by DePasquale, which includes two Harvard affiliates — epidemiology professor William P. Hanage and dual-degree medical and Harvard Business School student Kirby Erlandson. The EAP guides city leadership on strategies to mitigate the spread of the virus.

After turning in a final paper on Edo period paintings for his art history class, Andrew “Drew” H. Mammel ’21 started researching how to build a “tiny house.”
Upon learning his internship in Washington, D.C., was canceled in light of the coronavirus pandemic, Mammel decided to devote his summer to building a 20-foot by 8-foot house on a utility trailer, inspired by a love for watching tiny house construction videos on YouTube.
“Since I’m back at home, I kind of just wanted to have something to do so that I’m not just constantly watching TV or on Facebook or reading all summer,” Mammel said. “It’s very difficult to see accomplishment virtually for me, and so I really wanted to have something that I can physically look at.”
Mammel said he plans to build the diminutive dwelling on his family’s farm in Wyoming, funding the project with room and board fees refunded from the second half of the term. He hopes to eventually use the carpentry skills he learns to volunteer for Habitat for Humanity, a nonprofit organization that builds affordable housing around the world for families in need.
Mammel is among hundreds of Harvard students dreaming up alternative plans for a summer defined by COVID-19. After evacuating the College in mid-March, undergraduates are adapting to canceled internships and remote programming — and even taking relief efforts into their own hands.
Mammel said his new plans are eliciting a range of reactions — but an altogether positive response — from friends and family.
“All my college friends have been kind of excited by it," Mammel said. "They’ve been kind of prompting me and they’ve been enthused by it; they all seem to think it’s a fun idea."
His family was a bit more surprised. They expected him to pursue a more “formal” opportunity, like another internship, Mammel said.
“I don’t know, I think they think I’m going off the walls a bit,” he said. “But I think they’re generally supportive.”
Like Mammel, a number of Harvard undergraduates are also pursuing opportunities from home.
McKenna C. Reale ’23 wanted to make the most of a final summer in her hometown while also earning some money. She decided to apply for jobs at nearby businesses like Trader Joe’s, Starbucks, and Chipotle. Some of the postings for temporary workers were specially adapted to the pandemic.
“I noticed Starbucks and Chipotle — I think they’re doing takeout,” Reale said. “So if I worked there I would just be probably doing food prep, or just making drinks.”
Aidan R. Gibbons ’21 had his summer internship with Putnam Investments in Boston moved online. But unlike friends whose finance internships were cut short or completely canceled, his 10-week program remains intact.
“I have full faith that they’re going to do a great job and that it’ll still be a great experience,” Gibbons said. “I’m thankful that they didn’t just cancel it through and through.”
Karly Hou ’23 had a position lined up in Houston with Two Sigma, a quantitative hedge fund, that is also shifting online. Hou said the company will be shipping some equipment to her house to support the remote experience.
“Obviously it won’t be as good, but I’m super grateful that they’re still trying to keep it going,” Hou said.
As students adjust their personal plans for the next few months, extracurricular groups are reimagining how they engage with the student body and the world beyond Harvard.
Members of the Harvard International Relations Council were looking forward to spending part of the summer in the United Arab Emirates. They’ve since planned a virtual shift for an inaugural Harvard Model United Nations conference in the Middle East, originally scheduled to take place in Dubai this June.
The decision was difficult, according to Secretary-General of HMUN Dubai Nadine S. Bahour ’22. Bahour said the team had initially considered canceling the conference entirely, hoping to launch the first iteration in person. But given participant enthusiasm and already completed planning, they ultimately decided to go through with the conference — drawing high schoolers from around the world — but in a different form.
“We thought that a lot of people were excited for it and a lot of students had signed up, and we shouldn’t just take away the chance for them to participate just because they can’t do it in person,” Bahour said.
In its new online model, the group has spread the conference out from three days to five, intending to break up screen time for those involved through shorter sessions. Participant committees — which usually involve up to 200 students each — have shrunk to groups of 50 to facilitate interaction.
Despite logistical challenges like working across time zones, Bahour said the group is “rolling with the punches.” And moving to an online format comes with some benefits, she added. For example, it makes the conference accessible to more participants.
“It’s been beneficial for some students who maybe could not afford to travel to Dubai, or the timing just didn’t work for them to go all the way to the conference and spend that much time,” Bahour said. “We have a different target audience now, and it’s really heartwarming to see that people who really wanted to do it can now do it.”
Other organizations are creating opportunities to assist students looking to fill the summer with enterprising pursuits.
The Harvard Computer Society recently launched a two-part initiative to support students interested in exploring technology and entrepreneurship over the summer called the Summer Projects Initiative and the Builders Incubation Program.
The Summer Projects Initiative is an open-source spreadsheet that lists “project pitches” — ideas students propose to pursue during the summer — and “people pitches” — contact information for students who are looking for a project to join. Creator Anna Wang ’22 said the project encourages students to think innovatively, build their tech portfolios, and come together to bring these ideas to fruition.
One Summer Projects Initiative pitch is Congregate, a platform for virtual gatherings co-founded by roommates Bryan Y. Lee ’21 and Jacob V. Ajit ’21. According to Lee, Congregate allows users to engage in more unstructured, personable group conversations than possible on existing video conferencing alternatives.
“The VC club that I’m a part of, we host a bunch of events — particularly networking events — that are really unstructured that are super valuable to just build relationships, and we realized that those just aren’t replicable on things like Zoom because Zoom is too static,” Lee said. “It’s really only made for one large presenter, one main event; it doesn’t let you jump between conversations very easily.”
Instead, each event hosted on Congregate is broken into multiple topic-oriented conversation rooms which users can easily preview using a “lobby” screen, enter, and exit. Since its inception, the service has hosted events ranging from office hours to socials for members of Harvard’s incoming class of 2024.
“I think it’s a super unique opportunity just to be able to help a bunch of people gather,” Lee said.
The Builders Incubation Program, meanwhile, will provide support by way of funding, workshops, mentorship, and other resources for entrepreneurial projects, including those born out of the Summer Projects Initiative spreadsheet. Founder Ryan K. Kim ’21 said the initiative is geared toward peers “who just purely want to create something.”
“I think a lot of students have hit some barriers or hesitation when it comes to ‘what money do I actually use to create whatever projects I want to do,’ and so eliminating that and enabling people just to use all their creative juices, that’s kind of what we’re going for,” Kim said.
In the face of an unprecedented public health crisis, other students have become motivated to spend their summers directly addressing both the spread of COVID-19 and the socioeconomic concerns the disease exacerbates.
Carter J. Wilcox ’20, for example, has been working with COVID Safe Paths, a free, open-source contact-tracing tool developed out of the MIT Media Lab. Wilcox joined the initiative’s implementation team in March and plans to continue this work into the summer.
COVID Safe Paths is an app accompanied by a platform for public health officials that privately and securely logs users’ whereabouts. This way, if a user tests positive for COVID-19, his or her location data from previous weeks can be used to identify and notify others who may have been exposed to the virus.
“You and I at home, without giving anyone our data and without having to be tested for COVID-19, can get an alert if our paths have crossed with someone that's been uploaded onto that dataset,” Wilcox said.
Wilcox said that COVID Safe Paths prioritizes protecting users’ privacy by redacting sensitive locations — like homes and workplaces — before uploading any data onto the public server.
“It really is awesome to be working with a team that has created a piece of technology that not only solves the problem, but also does it in a really ethical way and really makes sure to put privacy at the center of its tech — ‘privacy-by-design,’ is what we call it,” Wilcox said.
As of early May, the COVID Safe Paths team includes over 1,300 volunteers, 40 of whom are Harvard undergraduates. Wilcox said the initiative continues to welcome additional support.
Other students have directed their support efforts toward widespread shortages of personal protective equipment facing frontline medical workers.
When Aishah I. Ahmed ’20 learned her Teach for America summer training session was moving to a virtual format, she started looking for ways to help her home city of Detroit, which she says has been hit hard by the pandemic.
Ahmed — who just completed a degree in Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology — said she realized her lab goggles from years of science courses could be reused by healthcare workers. That’s when she and her sister, Columbia University junior Sophia Ahmed, founded EyeAid Detroit.
Since launching last month, EyeAid Detroit has conducted outreach through channels like Instagram, Facebook, and GroupMe to amass hundreds of donations from individuals – and even entire school science departments – around the country.
“I think using a social media model and spreading awareness via social media and the internet is something that a lot of public service organizations should be thinking about in the future,” Ahmed said. “The new future that we’re entering might consist of less person-to-person interaction and might be less personable than what we were previously accustomed to.”
Other students, concerned that social issues will fall by the wayside during a public health crisis, are mobilizing to address the emotional and economic well-being of those around them, noting that the impact of the pandemic extends beyond the illness itself.
While social distancing and stay-at-home orders help flatten the curve of COVID-19 infections, studies have shown that social isolation can put people at risk for both physical and mental health issues, such as heart disease and depression.
For Allegra Rollo ’21, whose entire extended family lives in Italy, this problem is personal: Her grandmother has been alone for months.
Rollo and Campbell Erickson ’21, who said he also has grandparents in isolation, co-direct a COVID-19 Task Force of the Concordium, a Harvard-based organization that matches youth volunteers with seniors for conversations via video conferencing.
The organization matches each volunteer with a senior based on shared background and interests. So far, it has developed partnerships with senior centers and nursing homes in the Greater Boston area and recruited student volunteers from Harvard; it aspires for a nationwide reach by the end of the summer.
“It’s been absolutely integral to my happiness, my motivation, my feeling of agency during this time,” Rollo said. “It’s been really, really amazing to have something through which I can channel positive and productive energy.”
As Americans prepare for the possibility that the novel coronavirus may bring the worst economic downturn in nearly a century, other students are accepting chances to help alleviate socioeconomic challenges affecting their hometowns.
Reshini Premaratne ’21 planned to intern at a management consulting firm this summer, until her program went remote. Her firm gave interns the option to forego the virtual internship and volunteer with a charitable organization, all while still receiving their company salary.
With her extra time, Premaratne and her sister began work on a service project in their hometown of Richmond, which has the second-highest eviction rate among large cities in the United States. Dubbed the Richmond Block, the initiative plans to sponsor rent for those who have lost income and are at risk for eviction and homelessness.
“Five out of the top ten localities with the highest rankings for eviction rates are in Virginia, and it’s not a coincidence,” Premaratne, a Crimson editorial contributor, said. “It’s because Virginia, and Richmond especially, really favors landlords in terms of the legal rights in eviction proceedings.”
“I think the pandemic uncovers an issue that’s here all the time,” she added.
Premaratne said she thinks people in Richmond will want to help their neighbors because of a strong sense of city pride. To that end, she is recruiting donations from the area’s corporations, charitable foundations, and faith communities.
As K-12 students finish spring courses from their bedrooms and kitchens, other undergraduates hope to help create new opportunities for continuing learning amid the pandemic.
Inspired by the lack of remote educational support for students in her hometown and parents’ struggles balancing work and childcare, Hou decided to found the Wave Learning Festival.
Using Wave, college students and high school upperclassmen will teach free online seminars for middle and high school students, covering topics from “Philosophy and Morality of Emotions” to “How Cancer Works.” These classes will take place in “waves” every few weeks throughout the summer, with the first scheduled to launch on May 25.
With her internship with Two Sigma moved online, Hou hopes to divide her time between the two commitments this summer.
“A lot of my friends have mentioned that they really want to find some way to be able to help out during the pandemic, without having to leave their houses and jeopardize the health of their families,” Hou said. “So I thought that this would be a really easy way for people to be able to give back.”
While a number of online educational resources do currently exist, Hou said Wave aims to recreate some of the more interactive aspects of in-person classrooms that existing alternatives can’t capture.
“There are a lot of resources like YouTube and Khan Academy already out there, but with those things, you can’t have discussions on a philosophical text or hear opinions and critiques from your classmates, so that’s something that we’re hoping to simulate again,” Hou said.
According to Hou, the initiative is eliciting significant enthusiasm, with more than 50 students applying to be volunteer teachers within the first two days of Wave’s launch in early May.
“It’s super exciting to see how excited other people are to share their passions,” Hou added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said in a Tuesday interview that “nearly all” respondents to a College-wide survey about the coming semester expressed a strong desire to return to Harvard’s residential campus in the fall.
Khurana said more than 2,400 undergraduates responded to the survey, sharing a variety of ideas about how the College could architect a safe, in-person semester.
Students cited the advantages of in-person engagement as a major impetus for re-opening campus, according to Khurana. Those advantages included participating in clubs, engaging in research activities, and interacting with faculty outside of class.
Khurana said some respondents also noted the technical challenges of online learning, as well as challenging home circumstances that preclude academic success.
“In particular for first years and seniors, being on campus can be quite important to their experiences, including their social but also their learning experiences,” he said.
Khurana added that students also wrote about ways the pandemic has exacerbated their mental health conditions and generated new anxieties.
“We heard also about some of the general mental health stress that uncertainty presents to our students right now, uncertainty about what's happening on campus, but also what will happen in the fall and general uncertainty about the future,” he said. “We also heard about stresses that are happening at the family level, irrespective of the economic dislocation or family members becoming ill or in some cases, people losing loved ones.”
Khurana invited students to take the survey after University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 announced last month that Harvard would resume teaching and research in the fall.
Garber’s announcement nixed the possibility of a delayed start — which many students previously said they would prefer — but left much else uncertain. The email generated confusion among students, who cited the ways in which an online semester would exacerbate inequality, reignite debates surrounding equitable grading policies, and disrupt extracurricular activities.
In wake of the announcement, undergraduates penned a petition to the administration, formally arguing against a virtual fall semester and condemning the University’s plan to hold an open fall “no matter what.”
Khurana said he shares students’ hope. He added, however, that Harvard’s “fundamental approach” to education — which requires a dense, interactive campus environment — presents a challenge for executing undergraduates’ safe return.
“The challenge we face is that our close living quarters and the sort of way that students and our faculty and our staff all engage with each other is right now inconsistent with the physical distancing guidelines,” Khurana said.
“What we're trying to do is address those two aspects of the situation, which is recognizing that we are, at our essence, a residential liberal arts and science experience with lots of interaction, and that those interactions are inconsistent with social distancing and other public health guidelines,” he added.
As Harvard determines whether students can safely return to campus in the fall, Khurana said administrators are using an “evidence-based risk management approach” to apply data, public health guidelines, and expert recommendations to the College’s specific circumstances.
He added that administrators recognize these pragmatic factors must be weighed alongside concerns surrounding “equity and social justice.”
Khurana said Harvard intends to reach a final decision about the format of the fall semester by late June or early July.
