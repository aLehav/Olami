After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With festivities for Harvard’s 375th birthday under way nearby, its women’s volleyball team (9-7, 2-4 Ivy) could not take part in the celebration, dropping a 3-1 decision to Cornell (3-15, 1-5 Ivy) on Friday night. The Big Red, which had not won a game in the Ancient Eight before the match, beat the Crimson 12-25, 25-18, 25-17, and 25-18.
“Cornell was playing lights out, while our team didn’t really show up to play,” co-captain Christine Wu said. “They broke down our system ... and it was hard for us to get back into it and compete with them.”
Harvard began the match much differently than how it finished, taking the first set handily, 25-12.
But Cornell was not ready to quit. The Big Red came back in a big way, taking the remaining three games for the win.
Cornell kept Harvard to under 20 points in the final three sets and only got better in each successive set, building its hitting percentage from .275 in the second game to .292 in the third and .308 in the fourth and final frame. The Crimson, in contrast, worsened with each game, dropping from a .211 hitting percentage in the opening game to a meager .065 in the fourth.
Harvard junior Taylor Docter led all hitters with 14 kills and five blocks in the match. The Crimson has now dropped two league matches in a row but will have another chance for a win against Columbia Saturday evening.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NBA ownership cannot deprive players of their willingness to play the game of basketball. In the midst of a tantalizing waiting game, NBA players have taken it upon themselves to entertain fans.
The trend started early this summer, with high-profile NBA players, such as Kevin Durant, Lebron James and Kobe Bryant popping up in neighborhood gyms and outdoor courts across the country.
It intensified in September when Carmelo Anthony suggested a match up that would feature a rag-tag group billed as “Team Melo” play against “Team Philly” at Penn basketball’s famed home arena, the Palestra. And is set to continue into the prolonged NBA off-season.
Harvard’s sole current NBA representative and Warrior point guard, Jeremy Lin '10 is among the newest batch of players to perform in a hyped exhibition game. The core of the current 2011-12 roster will take on the core of the underdog 2007 Warriors—memorable for the “We Believe” t-shirts plastered all over their home Oracle Arena during a stunning first-round upset of the top-seeded Dallas Mavericks.
According to the Oakland Tribune, accompanying Lin will be 2009-2010 Rookie of the Year runner-up Stephen Curry, Dorell Wright, Charlie Bell, and rookie Jeremy Tyler. The 2007 squad will include Jason Richardson, Matt Barnes, Kelena Azubuike, and Anthony Morrow.
Members of both teams are still being recruited. Other NBA stars, including such as Gilbert Arenas and Jamal Crawford, are being considered to round out the rosters.
The game will be played on Saturday, Oct. 29 at 6:30 p.m. Proceeds from the game will be donated to the Kaiser Permanente Breast Cancer foundation and Barnes’ Athletes vs. Cancer foundation.
The game will be the only opportunity that Lin will have to play for Warriors’ fans until the lockout ends. The NBA has declared any player who played a 2010-11 regular season game ineligible for the NBA’s equivalent to the minor league, the D-League.
This decree comes as a condition of missed NBA regular season games this season. This means that Lin, who played 29 games last season, will not be able to work on his game in the D-league, scheduled to start in late November. He would have played for the Warriors’ newly acquired Dakota Wizards.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming into Saturday’s game, the quarterback question loomed large over Harvard football.
But junior Colton Chapple answered that question, coming up big in his fourth consecutive start of the year.
The Crimson (4-1, 2-0 Ivy) controlled the afternoon, easily beating Bucknell (4-2, 1-1 Patriot), 42-3.
In just over two quarters of play—Chapple was pulled early in the third quarter when Harvard led by 35—the junior quarterback had another performance that landed him in the Crimson’s history books.
Chapple’s five touchdowns tied for the most ever by a Harvard passer in a single game. The first and only other time it happened was in 1953 (544 games ago). Chapple is also the first quarterback to ever throw for four touchdowns in back-to-back games.
After a prolific first half, sophomore Michael Pruneau came into the game rather than senior Collier Winters, perhaps an indication that Chapple is the clear starter going forward.
Harvard’s offense wasn’t the only dominant element of its game. The Crimson controlled on all fronts, nearly holding the Bison scoreless. At half-time, Bucknell had just 31 yards of total offense, rushing for -5 net yardage.
Even Harvard special teams handily outplayed its Bison opponents. All day, sophomore kicker David Mothander squibbed the kickoffs, and on one particularly bizarre play, the Crimson recovered a ball that trickled into the red zone, giving Harvard excellent field position and leading to a touchdown.
Though the Crimson controlled the pace early on, it couldn’t score until the last play of the first quarter. Chapple hit junior tight end Kyle Juszczyk in the end zone to give Harvard the 7-0 edge at the end of the quarter.
But two early touchdowns early in the second quarter—a 27-yard pass to senior Alex Sarkisian and a nine-yarder to sophomore tight end Cameron Brate set up by the recovered squib kick—put the game out of reach early on.
On the day, Chapple threw for 176 yards, completing 13 of 23 passes.
