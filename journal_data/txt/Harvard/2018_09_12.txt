After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We are glad to see that Harvard is committed to its service workers, per a recent article published in the New York Times. According to the article, service workers employed by a contractor working with the University receive equal benefits, including health insurance and vacations, to those they would receive if they were employed by the University directly. The result of this policy is that service workers at Harvard can earn enough to live comfortably, with many lifted into the middle-class. This pay rate lies in stark contrast to that of comparable service jobs outside the University, most of which pay less than $30,000 a year.
Harvard is setting a good example in its implementation of this policy. The University is hearing its employees’ concerns rather than outsourcing to less expensive options. This demonstrates loyalty to Harvard service employees and the acknowledgement that people deserve to be well-compensated for their work. Still, the wages and benefits Harvard offers may not scale to the economy at large without causing unemployment. They also might only be possible for well-endowed institutions. Nevertheless, Harvard’s implementation of this policy is commendable.
For other institutions considering this policy, it’s worth noting that, in 2001, the committee appointed to study the issue estimated that this policy would cost the University between $2.4 million to $3.7 million a year. This is a fairly insignificant amount compared to Harvard’s operating budget of almost $5 billion — the University improved the lives of its service workers without experiencing much financial loss for doing so.
Of course, these changes did not occur by themselves, and the organizations that engendered them, including the Harvard Living Wage Campaign and student protesters, too deserve our praise. Students protested outside of Massachusetts Hall — the location of the office of the University president. Dozens of the protesters also occupied the first floor as part of a three-week sit-in. This is a powerful reminder of the importance and effectiveness of protest in creating lasting change in Harvard’s administrative policies.
These are positive changes that the University is making, but the University should take bigger steps in helping its service workers. These steps should include (but should not be limited to) giving them the skills and resources that are necessary — including education — to get other jobs should they choose to leave Harvard in the future.
The University could not run without its employees of all levels, and Harvard’s pay and benefits for its service workers shows its recognition of this. We hope to see this continued devotion in the years to come.

Sexual violence — an umbrella term which encompasses sexual harassment, sexual assault, and rape — has become a pervasive issue. However, it is not a problem that suddenly emerged from nowhere. Sexual violence has been an epidemic for centuries, but only now are people starting to speak out and receive acknowledgement.
Open and honest discourse about sexual violence is the best way to start repairing our broken culture. We must be educated about consent. We must stop victim blaming. We must support survivors.
I know what you are thinking: We heard all this during freshman Opening Days. We hear the same advice on the news all the time. This is not revolutionary thinking here. You are right. Nothing I am saying is particularly enlightening in theory, but what about in practice?
What would you say if your best friend told you they had been assaulted? What about your girlfriend? Your boyfriend? That kid from your general education course you had lunch with a few times? And what if it is not just a one-time confession? What if they want to talk about it over the course of your friendship? How would you support them?
Unfortunately, there is no one-size-fits-all answer to these questions. Every human being is unique, and different survivors need different forms of support. Nevertheless, there are a few good first steps to take.
Listen. Take in what they say, and give them a judgement-free space to talk. Try not to interrupt, even if the topic makes you feel uneasy. They need someone to whom they can open up.
Do not victim-blame. It may seem obvious not to blame the victim of a crime, but sometimes, when it comes to sexual violence, victim blaming is second nature. We may wonder if they were sober, if they agreed to go back to the other person’s place, or if they said “no” clearly enough. A million questions and scenarios may run through your mind. Do not ask them. Sexual violence is not the victim’s fault, and your role is one of comforting, not questioning.
Validate their trauma. Do not downgrade it by saying things could have been worse. No, not all sexual violence is equally severe, but all forms are deeply harmful to the victim. Saying their trauma was less significant because of the physical form it took can prove harmful.
Do not let personal feelings for the accused get in the way of supporting the victim. Considering seven out of 10 rapes are committed by someone known to the victim, chances are high that you may know the perpetrator if you and your friend run in the same circles. Do not let personal attachment prevent you from being a support to someone who may really need you.
Do not take unilateral action. You may think that reporting the assault to your school or involving the police is an obvious step, but the decision is not yours to make. Some people prefer not to report. Some people prefer not to seek justice through legal means. For many, the process is too painful and not worth reliving their trauma. You may not agree with this choice, but you must respect it.
Supporting a victim of sexual violence is not easy, and should not be dismissed as an effortless part of being a friend. There is no shame in struggling to help in the right way.
I have been in this position, and it can be trying. Learning that someone you care about was violated is heartbreaking and infuriating. I got angry. I wanted the bastard to pay for what he did. I wanted the institution that allowed it to see consequences.
However, in my case, unleashing these emotions in front of my friend would not have been helpful. I needed guidance in order to provide support. Sometimes these topics are too heavy to handle on your own. I leaned on my mom, and she helped me to be a good ally. Telling someone helped ease the burden, and it made me feel like the responsibility was not mine alone. While I would never have told another friend, as the choice of whom to tell is the victim’s alone, for me, my mother was a confidential, outside party who could guide me. Finding outside help, be it a parent or counsellor or advisor, may be beneficial because dealing with sexual violence is difficult and uncertain territory for most people.
Sexual violence is never easy to confront. But we need to try. Start the conversation when you can, and be a listener when you need to be. We all must strive to be allies to those who have suffered, even when it is difficult. If we build networks of support, we can tear down the isolation and silence that perpetuate this epidemic.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At work this summer, everything was a networking opportunity — from the official socializing events that had “networking” in the title to the random run-ins with senior staff while standing in the lunch line. Networking was so important that we could clock it in. The emphasis was mildly uncomfortable, but not because I didn’t enjoy meeting people whose careers I admired and whose opinions I wanted to hear. The term “networking” just didn’t feel right.
There is no lack of networking opportunities at college too. Already, in the second week of school, my inbox is full of “networking sessions” and “networking nights.” The term is also so ubiquitous that sometimes when I reflected on my first year here, I found myself saying I wished I had networked more. But I disliked this turn of phrase. What I wanted to have done was to “make more friends” or “start more relationships.” It seemed insulting to the people at Harvard that I would refer to my desire to get to know more of them as just “networking.”
Because “networking” doesn’t feel human enough. Networking is for machines! The technology may have changed, but the fundamental image stays the same. In the 1550s, a “network” would have referred to a literal net-like arrangement of threads or wires. In the 1830s, “network” was used to refer to transport systems like rivers, canals, and railways. In the 1910s, it was also used to refer to broadcast systems of multiple transmitters. And in the 1970s, it began to refer to computers.
It was only in the late 1970s that the act of “networking” began to also apply to humans, in the modern sense of creating a system of contacts. I think that this is no coincidence. Technology has come to define more and more aspects of our society.
But this takeover is not entirely a good thing. In terms of networking, I especially don’t want to feel like a machine following a procedure to get a good career. I think most people enjoy the conversations that make up effective networking and do not need to be constantly reminded to network.
For the past few summers, for example, I have been lucky enough to have internships where I was surrounded by people who have done amazing things and who have insightful opinions. The people with whom I had coffees and conversations were not items to check off a list. They were just great coworkers and mentors that I’m lucky to have gotten to know and want to keep in touch with.
The image of “networking” also doesn’t emphasize the right parts of the activity because it keeps the focus outwards — on always adding more and more nodes to a central hub. This mindset minimizes the humanity and individuality of the people one is trying to meet. Those people are simply subsumed into one’s ever-expanding network.
Are there ways to think about “networking” that aren’t so transactional and dehumanizing? Or, better yet, are there ways not to have to think of it? The most grating thing about “networking” is all the emphasis placed on doing it, which makes me overthink it. It makes me question whether I’m being too transactional, and then question whether I’m being too self-conscious about being transactional if everyone else is doing it too. It makes me constantly assess the quantity and quality of my network, which makes me question whether I’m being too transactional again.
My mind turns to the E. M. Forster quote “Only connect.” This is what networking should ultimately be about. A connection narrows the focus down to the two people. It’s about getting close to the person one wants to get to know, not just adding them to one’s existing roster. It feels less technological and more symbiotic. We need some emphasis back on this — the natural ease of connecting with other people, as opposed to the rote procedure of professional networking.
We’re humans, not machines, and so we do not connect out of obligation, but out of interest. And because we are humans, not machines, we are much more than what we do for work.

Harvard and the University of Michigan will partner on initiatives and summits to address economic opportunity and the opioid epidemic, the universities announced jointly Wednesday.
The Equality of Opportunity Project, led by two Harvard professors, will work with the University of Michigan’s Poverty Solutions initiative on developing “interventions” in Detroit, Mich. regarding economic mobility. The schools will also plan two policy summits together on the national opioid crisis featuring experts in government, medicine, public health, and other fields, according to a press release.
The collaboration comes as University President Lawrence S. Bacow is scheduled to return to Michigan — his home state — this week to participate in a panel of high-profile former Detroit natives who have returned to the city for the program.
“I am delighted that Harvard will be partnering with one of the country’s leading public research universities to make progress on issues that are among the most pressing of our time,” Bacow said in the press release. “I am also excited to further deepen Harvard’s work in Michigan where we will engage with local partners, contribute to solutions and learn from collaborators in Detroit and beyond.”
The partnership will work with Detroit and its mayor, Mike E. Duggan, to develop and implement new programs on neighborhood revitalization, affordable housing, and youth-focused initiatives. University of Michigan’s Poverty Solutions initiative, created in 2016, seeks to reduce poverty in the United States, and the Equality of Opportunity Project studies the causes of economic success and failure across the country.
Duggan said in the press release that he is excited about the schools’ partnership.
“We are trying to build a comeback that includes all Detroiters and we welcome the support of these two prestigious institutions in that effort,” he said.
The policy summits on the opioid epidemic — one of which could take place as early as this winter — will address issues including opioid prescriptions, drug overdose detection, access to treatment, and criminal justice, according to the press release.
Michigan associate professor Chad Brummett, the co-director of the Michigan Opioid Prescribing Engagement Network, will lead the University of Michigan’s end of the collaboration, while Mary T. Bassett, the newly appointed director of the François-Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights at Harvard, will head the effort from Harvard.
Bacow's trip to Michigan comes amid criticisms — including some from policymakers in Washington — that Harvard and its peer institutions are out of touch with the rest of the United States. Bacow, who took office in July, has pledged to counter this perception by traveling across the country to make the case for higher education.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Arne S. Duncan ’87, former secretary of education and Harvard Basketball alumnus, took the stage Tuesday evening at the Harvard Kennedy School to share his insights about the present state of American education and reflect on his career in public service.
The event, titled “Education and the State of Affairs in Washington,” was held at the Institute of Politics and was co-sponsored by Harvard Men’s Basketball. Duncan was accompanied by moderator David Gergen, a professor of public leadership at the Kennedy School and former White House adviser.
Duncan discussed his perspectives on the current state of K–12 education and the persistent inequality in educational opportunities in American schools. The former secretary criticized the administration of current U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos under President Donald Trump.
Duncan delivered a blunt assessment of the educational philosophy of the Trump administration, claiming that officials' silence and inactivity on K–12 education reform are deliberate.
“I would argue this administration does not want a well-educated citizenry, does not want people who can think independently,” Duncan said. “The absence of voice is not a mistake; I would argue that is intentional.”
He was also critical of the state of teacher training in America, referencing a survey that stated that two-thirds of education school graduates felt that they were not prepared to enter the teaching profession.
“If two-thirds of doctors said they were unprepared to practice medicine, we would have a revolution in this country,” Duncan said. “But we don’t value teachers. We don’t value education.”
Duncan argued that the issue of education is not salient in elections and public policy debates. He cited stagnation in multiple areas of student achievement, including math scores and college completion rates, as factors contributing to the decline in America’s standing as a world leader in education.
When pressed about several policy decisions he made as former President Barack Obama’s education secretary from 2009 to 2015, including the introduction of Common Core and the controversial federal grant program Race to the Top, Duncan mostly defended his record of advocating for “higher” content standards and greater teacher accountability.
The former secretary of education concluded the discussion by commenting on gun violence and its effect on urban schools, reflecting on his own childhood experiences in Chicago and his current non-profit work. He emphasized the importance of youth advocacy in the wake of the shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. and said it has stirred public activism despite relative inactivity following several previous school shootings.
As a student at Harvard College, Duncan graduated magna cum laude with a degree in Sociology. On the basketball court, Duncan excelled for the Crimson as one of 34 players to have reached 1,000 career points in a Harvard uniform.
Currently, Duncan is a managing partner at Emerson Collective, an organization focused on initiatives in education, social justice, immigration, and the environment.

The number of Harvard Business School applications dropped by 4.5 percent last year, but other class demographics experienced little change, HBS reported in its latest class profile.
HBS received 9,886 applications for its two-year MBA program for the class of 2020, down from 10,351 the previous year. The class of 2019 figure, however, marked a 6 percent increase in applications from the year prior. In the past year, business schools across the United States have reported significant declines in the number of MBA program applicants partly because fewer international students are seeking to study in the U.S. as a result of the political climate.
Despite Harvard’s drop in applications, the Business School’s acceptance rate has held steady at 11 percent. In total, 930 MBA students started classes at HBS last week, marking a 90 percent matriculation rate for admitted students — the highest yield among business schools worldwide.
Gender and ethnic demographics have also varied little in the past five years. In all, 41 percent of students in the class of 2020 are women, a 2 percent drop from two years ago. In addition, 26 percent of students are U.S. ethnic minorities and 37 percent are international, representing an at least five-year high, with students hailing from 69 countries across the world.
While this year’s class median undergraduate GPA remained unchanged at 3.71, a higher percentage of the class of 2020 submitted GRE scores than years past. Though the GRE is traditionally submitted by applicants for other types of graduate programs, the GMAT has long been favored by students applying for business schools. Still, 85 percent of the class submitted GMAT results with a median score of 730 out of 800.
Though admitted students typically boast high GPAs and impressive test scores, HBS Dean Nitin Nohria said he has a different top priority when evaluating applicants: leadership.
In a Sept. 3 interview with Business Insider, Nohria said he wants candidates to answer the question, “What is it that other people would say that would describe you as a leader?”
"We are excited about leaders of all kinds," Nohria said. "They just need to be people who are pursuing a particular passion in which they are likely to be very good leaders.”

“Clear admit; one to recruit,” one reviewer wrote of Harvard applicant Thang Q. Diep ’19. The reviewer then checked a box next to the words “Diamond in the rough.”
“Not a bad package when you put it all together,” a Harvard admissions officer wrote in Diep’s file.
It was early 2015, and an alumni interviewer and several employees in the College’s admissions office were evaluating the candidacy of Harvard hopeful Diep, who ultimately won acceptance to the College. In a document totaling at least four pages, the reviewers commented on Diep’s “perfect grades,” his “incredibly hard working” nature, and his impressive roll call of student group leadership positions.
All of the above fits the popular conception of a successful Harvard applicant. But the interviewer and the admissions officers also focused on more intangible qualities — Diep’s Vietnamese background and immigrant status, his modesty, why and how he spent a lot of his free time on YouTube and Tumblr, his “warm energy,” and his “truly unusual” openness to new ideas and new people.
Over the summer, Diep submitted portions of his unredacted admissions file in court in an effort to help the University combat a four-year-old lawsuit that alleges it discriminates against Asian-American applicants. As part of that suit, Harvard is defending against accusations — which surfaced in June — that it disproportionately gives Asian-American applicants like Diep poorer ratings for their personal traits.
The College has repeatedly denied both allegations. Diep, one of a group of Harvard students and alumni who are working with lawyers to aid the school in court, has said he does not believe Harvard’s admissions process is discriminatory.
“As an Asian American, I do not believe that Harvard’s race conscious admissions policy hurt me,” Diep wrote in a court declaration. “I disclosed my race and I did not have stellar grades, but I was accepted to Harvard most likely based on my personal statement, which reflected the diversity that I brought to campus.”
Diep’s filing is just one of tens of thousands of admissions-related documents and datasheets that Judge Allison D. Burroughs will review as she decides how to rule in a suit that could shape the fate of affirmative action in the United States. And Diep was just one of 37,305 high school students who applied to the College in 2015 — only 5.3 percent of whom were accepted.
Still, Diep’s marked-up application sheds some light on how College interviewers and admissions officers assess applicants — and on just what it takes to be Harvard material. Below, The Crimson annotates the application and analyzes what made Diep successful.
Reviewer comments on Diep’s file zeroed in on the student’s personality and behavior in social settings.
Diep’s papers — which his attorney attached as an exhibit in an August court filing — include comments from at least two admissions office employees as well as a lengthy evaluation from his alumni interviewer. Almost every applicant to Harvard interviews with an alumnus of the College as part of the admissions process.
Diep obtained his application by stopping by the registrar’s office to review it — something all Harvard students can do under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act — and snapping four photos, one per page, with his iPhone.
The interviewer ranked Diep on his academic, extracurricular, and character traits. Diep earned a “2-” overall and a “3+” for his “personal qualities.” A June 15 filing in the lawsuit revealed that Harvard rates applicants in a variety of categories from 1 to 6 — 1 being the highest and 6 being the lowest score. Admissions officers can also use a “+” or a “-” to enhance or reduce the ranking.
The alumni interviewer devoted essay-length commentary to praise of Diep's personal qualities and outgoing, friendly nature. The interviewer wrote Diep showed an “above average personal appeal and character” and noted that he is “deeply social.”
“We met at a local coffee shop and twice during our interview, classmates (who was [sic] unaware he was on an interview) stopped by to say hello,” the interviewer wrote. “Though this may be an unfair judgement, it appeared to me that both students that came by were from different social circles.”
“It became apparent to me that Thang may be friends with a wide variety of students in his school,” the interviewer added.
The interviewer predicted Diep would be a “warm” friend, a “well-liked classmate” and an “outstanding” roommate at Harvard. The interviewer further appeared to prize Diep's lack of braggadocio, twice describing him as "modest" and once as "humble."
The admissions officers who scrutinized Diep’s file also focused on his character.
“Thang writes a thoughtful application through which he conveys a strong sense of himself,” one admissions officer wrote. “His school loves him and assures us he is an unusually caring individual who works very hard and has an ‘infectiously happy personality.’”
Another officer wrote that Diep has “done a good deal to push his own boundaries and explore new experiences.”
The alumni interviewer was impressed by what they called Diep’s “perfect grades,” writing that he had “cum laude potential.” Diep listed his weighted GPA as 4.325 on a 4.0 scale.
But the interviewer found Diep’s SAT score — listed as 2060 on the application — less showstopping. The interviewer wrote Diep’s score fell “on the lower end of the Harvard average.”
Diep’s score meant he ranked around the 25th percentile for each section of the SAT relative to other matriculated members of Harvard’s Class of 2019. Nationally, a 2060 meant Diep ranked in the 95th percentile relative to other college-bound high school seniors in 2014.
Diep’s alumni interviewer gave him a “3+” rating for his academics.
“He is modest about his academic achievements but it became clear throughout the interview that he sets very high standards for himself and strives for excellence,” the interviewer wrote. “He mentioned he wished his SAT score was higher, though this total score was way above average for most universities.”
The interviewer was even more pleased with Diep’s commitments outside the classroom, giving him a “2” rating for his extracurriculars. In high school, Diep was president of the Key Club, an officer of his student government, a hospital volunteer, and an avid filmmaker, according to his application materials.
As part of his Harvard application, Diep penned an extracurricular-focused essay on his participation in a filmmaking summit. The alumni interviewer particularly mentioned Diep’s trip to Serbia to produce a short film about discrimination.
Previous court filings have shown that Harvard’s notion of an applicant that deserves a “2” ranking for his or her extracurricular accomplishments is “typically an applicant with significant school, and possibly regional accomplishments: for example, an applicant who was the student body president or captain of the debate team and the leader of multiple additional clubs.”
The reviewers made note of Diep’s first-generation, socioeconomic, and foreign-born status.
Diep, who was born in Vietnam, said in an interview that he is the child of two immigrant parents who did not attend college. His Common Application essay emphasized his “immigrant Vietnamese identity,” according to one admissions officer’s comments.
The interviewer twice mentioned that Diep's first language was not English and also wrote that Diep had "faced the challenge" of moving to the United States — though Diep seemed to have navigated the move without too much difficulty, the interviewer noted.
"I didn't pick up on any struggle at all. In fact, I didn't realize he was not born in the states until he mentioned it (there didn't seem to be any cultural disconnect, etc)," the interviewer wrote. "It is clearly not something he has let get in his way, and I got the sense very quickly that he has not made him any less social with his classmates [sic]."
One admissions officer called Diep “a well involved, first generation student from a modest background" and wrote he is "one to compare with [Harvard Financial Aid Initiative] info."  Another noted Harvard should “ponder” Diep “in HFAI context.”
The Harvard Financial Aid Initiative is the College’s signature financial aid program targeted toward low- and middle-income students. Families whose income is less than $65,000 per year pay nothing toward the cost of their child’s education at Harvard — most recent statistics estimate 20 percent of enrollees fall in this category. Approximately 70 percent of College students receive some form of aid. Harvard describes its application process as need-blind. The College’s financial aid office states “your financial need will not impede your chances of admission.”
So far, Diep is likely the only student to see a portion of his admissions file become public as part of the lawsuit. But that could change.
Harvard has forked over roughly 90,000 pages of internal admissions documents labeled "Confidential" or "Highly Confidential" — including other files like Diep’s and email correspondence among Harvard admissions officers — in the course of the case. Much of that information would likely become public if the suit, brought in Nov. 2014 by anti-affirmative action advocacy group Students for Fair Admissions, goes to trial this fall.
That trial — which experts have said will almost certainly take place — is set to kick off in a Boston courthouse on Oct. 15.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Arnav Agrawal ’20 decided to run for a seat on the Undergraduate Council during his freshman fall, he ran on a largely single-issue platform: bringing menstrual hygiene products to every dormitory on campus.
Two years later, after a pilot program, campus-wide survey, town hall, and multiple meetings with administrators, the UC and a menstrual hygiene advocacy group convinced the College to finally make that platform a reality.
“I’m from New Delhi, India, where there’s a lot more awareness and enthusiasm about provision of free products, and I thought Harvard, being the best college, should definitely have it,” Agrawal said. “If the College can provide free condoms, why can they not provide free tampons?”
Over the summer, the College worked with House building managers to install a dispenser in each upperclassman House and freshman yard that will provide tampons and pads.
The dispensers, which custodial staff will fill regularly, are mostly located in gender-neutral restrooms in order to reach students who may not be comfortable in a women’s bathroom, according to UC Vice President Nicholas D. Boucher ’19.
The process of gaining financial backing for the initiative from administrators was a long one.
After Agrawal was elected in 2016, discussions of the issue began to occur more widely within the Council.  And outside of the UC, an advocacy organization on campus called the Hygiene Campaign — now known as PERIOD — ramped up efforts to win administrators' approval for efforts to make menstrual products more accessible.
When advocates for the program brought the proposal to College administrators, they said they would require “extensive data” demonstrating need for the products before they might consider funding such a large-scale program, according to Agrawal, now the chair of the UC’s Student Life Committee, and Emma Y. He ’19, president of PERIOD.
UC and PERIOD leaders got to work collecting that data.
In the spring of 2017, the Council allocated $1,000 for a pilot program in freshman dorms. In fall 2017, the pilot was expanded to four upperclassmen houses. By all accounts, the initiative was successful, with supplies frequently exhausted due to high demand.
Still, student leaders wanted to bring a stronger case to administrators, so the Council commissioned a survey to ask students about the prospect of wider availability of menstrual products.
In recent years, UC surveys have received relatively low response rates, most likely a reflection of a broader lack of student engagement with Council affairs.
This time was different, though. Over 2,000 students responded to the menstrual hygiene survey, the most of any survey in UC history.
One question appeared designed specifically to appeal to administrators: "Do you think that the College should provide students with free menstrual hygiene products in all dorms and public places such as libraries etc.?" the question read.
Over 97 percent of respondents responded ‘yes.’
With a strong case for student need for hygiene products in tow, UC leaders went back to administrators to ask for funding once again. This time, administrators “immediately” consented, Boucher said.
“We felt that the cost was modest relative to the demonstrated need, so we didn’t feel it was an undue burden and we went ahead with it,” said Zak Gingo, Harvard’s Senior Director of Operations.
For He, the availability of menstrual products is a matter of gender equality.
“I think it is normalized in our society that we expect menstruators to carry their tampons and pads around, but if you actually think about it, it makes no sense, and it is extremely gendered,” she said. “It’s more about access to education because so many people are late to class or they skip class because they don’t have a tampon or pad on them.”
Though UC and PERIOD leaders said they were encouraged by administrators' willingness to fund dispensers in Houses and dorms, their ultimate goal would be to make hygiene products available in a significant number of academic buildings around campus as well.
“For now, though, we could not be more excited to see that this is here for the start of the year,” Boucher said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Kennedy School is gearing up for the upcoming midterm elections by introducing a University-wide voting challenge to encourage Harvard affiliates to register to vote before the Nov. 6 elections.
The Harvard Votes Challenge, centered at the Kennedy School’s Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation and the Institute of Politics, currently has leaders assigned to nine of Harvard’s schools to help students register to vote and to host several “Harvard Votes Action Days” to actively get out the vote.
Theodore "Teddy" N. Landis ’20, a co-founder of the project, said he and fellow founder Derek Paulhus ’19 came together to solve the “big problem” of “lower voter participation rate” at the University.
“I learned the statistic that millennials and post-millenials combined will make up the largest voting block in America for the first time in 2018 but at the same time, we don't really vote,” Landis said. “I felt that it was really important that we take action."
The program will also encourage Harvard schools to incorporate Turbovote, an online voter registration platform, into their class registration processes. Turbovote — after its inception by three Kennedy School alums in 2011 — was introduced into the College’s check-in process in 2016.
According to the National Study of Voting, Learning, and Engagement, just 23.6 percent of eligible Harvard students voted in the 2014 midterms. However, in the run-up to this year’s election, the Institute of Politics’s biannual youth poll determined that more than 37 percent of young Americans said they “definitely will be voting” in the 2018 election cycle.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow took part in this push for greater civic participation in his speech welcoming freshmen to the College earlier this month. Bacow directed students at the College's annual freshman convocation ceremony to take out their phones and write down the address for an Institute of Politics website which they could use to register to vote.
At the Kennedy School, various fellows and professors spent much of the summer working on ways to integrate voter participation programs into the institution to “create a culture of voting,” according to Teresa Acuña, the associate director of the Ash Center’s Democratic Governance program.
“As a place that prides itself in producing the future leaders of the world, if we can't get them to participate, that's a very concerning thing for what we think is going to be the sustainability of our democracy here and abroad,” Acuña said.
“It’s important that the Kennedy School students walk the walk in public service and the very first basic act of citizenship is voting,” HKS citizenship professor Archon Fung said.
Acuña said reminders to register to vote were placed in areas that were easily accessible to students, such as the course check-in process, the financial aid website, and certain school-wide events.
“What that is from an institutional level is signaling to students here at the Kennedy School, we very much care about your civic participation, so much that we're putting it in these different places where we consider necessary in order for you to even become a student,” Acuña said.
Nearly 25 percent of eligible Kennedy School students have registered to vote through this platform, Acuña said.
Other parts of the Kennedy School have also begun preparing for the midterm elections — for instance, leaders from the HKS Democratic Caucus said they created a position on their executive board specifically dedicated to canvassing and phone banking efforts in time for the midterms.
“We are excited to get students involved in this year’s election, both domestically and for students from international schools,” said Michael R. Miesen, an executive board member of the Caucus.
“We have students from all over the world and they bring unique experiences and perspectives to our school here, and this is a really interesting year for them to be at the Kennedy School in America, in Cambridge,” Miesen added.
Fung emphasized the importance of university students voting to positively impact elections and the future of politics.
“Young people don't vote very much,” Fung said. “And I think the confidence in government has gone down. So my hope is that if more young people turn out to vote and the electorate changes a little bit, then people will have more say in politics and the relationship and attitude towards government and public officials will change in a more positive direction — that they'll want to make government better.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Almost as soon as Harvard’s new president officially took office, concerned University affiliates reached out hoping to discuss another president — the one in Washington.
A group of faculty, students, and staff will huddle this fall with University President Lawrence S. Bacow, who assumed the post over the summer, to strategize about the ways Harvard can support those at the University affected by the Trump administration’s controversial policies on immigration.
Though an official date for the meeting has not been set, Bacow’s office proposed Oct. 1 as a potential date for the cohort to congregate, according to an email provided to The Crimson.
The planned discussion falls roughly a year after the Trump administration terminated Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an Obama-era program that allows undocumented youth to live and work in the United States. Roughly 65 Harvard affiliates were undocumented in the 2017-2018 academic year.
Several court injunctions in the past year have compelled the Trump administration to continue processing DACA renewal applications — so for now, Harvard's DACA recipients can renew their status. The future of the program remains uncertain, though.
The upcoming meeting with Bacow also comes after Trump’s 2017 executive order limiting travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries, a ban that was upheld by the Supreme Court in June. That order caused at least four Harvard affiliates to be temporarily barred from the United States.
The coalition slated to meet with Bacow includes leaders of student groups such as UndocuAllies and Act on a Dream — an organization that advocates for immigrant rights — and staff and faculty members who have been active in pro-immigrant movements on campus.
Graduate School of Education Professor Roberto G. Gonzales, whose research focuses on immigration, said that — in early conversations — Bacow's administration has seemed “very eager” to hold the meeting. Gonzales said he and other faculty would like to consult Bacow on how Harvard can “increase support and protection” for students, faculty, and staff impacted by Trump-era immigration policies.
“Our students are arguably much more vulnerable in this new school year given some of the policy changes certainly around DACA and TPS, but also with the travel ban,” Gonzales said.
University spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson declined to comment directly on the meeting but wrote in an emailed statement that Bacow and Harvard are committed to protecting undocumented Harvard affiliates.
“President Bacow and Harvard remain deeply committed to supporting those in our community who have been impacted by changes in the federal government’s TPS, DACA and other immigration policies, and we will continue to make every effort to have our voice heard and to advocate for permanent legislative solutions to these challenging issues,” Jackson wrote in an emailed statement.
Harvard has already taken steps to advocate for its students affected by immigration reform.
Bacow spoke with lawmakers about immigration and DACA on a recent trip to D.C. and joined the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, Jackson wrote.
Bacow has also asked University General Counsel Robert W. Iuliano ’83 to coordinate the University’s efforts to support students and staff who are protected under DACA and TPS, according to Jackson.
The University employs a full-time time staff attorney at the Law School’s Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program who is tasked with helping students navigate uncertain territory in the era of Trump. Harvard officially appointed  Jason M. Corral to that position in Jan. 2017, two months after Trump’s election.
Before she stepped down in June, Bacow’s predecessor Drew G. Faust made fighting for DACA one of her top lobbying priorities. When the Trump administration announced its Sept. 2017 decision to end DACA, former Faust swiftly denounced the decision as “cruel.” She also wrote letters to Washington lawmakers and appeared on national television to speak in favor of DACA.
Bacow previously praised Faust’s advocacy efforts and said he, too, hopes to serve as a “strong voice” on the national stage.
Gonzales called Faust’s advocacy a “good start.” But he said there is more Harvard could do — he wants the University to offer mental health resources to students affected by Trump’s policies, add an additional staff attorney to the Law School clinic, and offer faculty with expertise in immigration a seat at the table when Harvard is deciding its approach to the ongoing challenges.
Act on a Dream advocacy co-chair Bruno O. Villegas-McCubbin ’19 said he agreed with Gonzales.
“We really hope that the president will not just maintain the existing structures that we were able to implement under President Faust, but hopefully expand upon them, and delve into them further, look at how they're working, how this could be improved, where more funding and resources could be allocated,” Villegas-McCubbin said.
This is not the first time Bacow has faced Harvard affiliates concerned about immigration reform. A day after he took office in July, a group of 30 staff, students, and faculty rallied in Harvard Yard to deliver a letter asking him to follow in Faust’s footsteps and advocate for permanent legal protections for undocumented individuals. The demonstration was organized by the Harvard TPS Coalition, a group of workers, students, and faculty that advocates for permanent residency for individuals with DACA or Temporary Protected Status — a legal designation given to individuals from certain countries who have fled armed conflict or natural disasters.
The TPS Coalition partnered with Act on a Dream to organize another rally held last week in the Science Center, at which a group of 75 Harvard affiliates protested the federal government’s termination of TPS — and again urged Bacow to action.
“We will continue to make every effort to have our voice heard and to advocate for permanent legislative solutions to these challenging issues,” Jackson wrote in a statement responding to the rally.
Activists are turning up the heat not just at Harvard, but across the nation. The Trump administration’s attempted rollback of protections for undocumented youth has sparked court battles, congressional debates about a permanent solution to immigration reform, and protests spanning the country.
Though the Trump administration initially gave Congress a March 5 deadline to pass a permanent solution for DACA or immigration reform, legislators made no progress over the summer. Gonzales said he does not expect lawmakers to make any moves until after the midterm elections this November.
“We won’t see congressional action on immigration until likely 2019,” he said. “What that means is that in the best case scenario, we have a program like DACA for another another year or so.”
In the meantime, DACA faces another potential threat from the Supreme Court. Texas and six other states brought a federal lawsuit meant to end DACA in May; in August, a conservative judge made a surprise ruling in favor of the Obama-era program, temporarily foiling the suit. But experts say it could come before the Supreme Court — and if the Court rules in favor of the seven states, it will be the end of DACA.
If DACA is rescinded, it will cause the “mass disenfranchisement” of the 800,000 undocumented youth currently protected under the program, Gonzales said.
In addition to the meeting with Bacow, both graduate and undergraduate student groups are looking to collaborate in the coming months and years as Trump winds up his first term and looks to a second.
“Act on a Dream is working in collaboration with other organizations, including at the grad school level and the workers unions, to sort of think about what are the broader issues, immigration issues that need to be addressed on this campus related to DACA, but also other things like TPS and workers’ rights,” Villegas-McCubbin said.
One of these organizations is UndocuAllies, an advocacy group formed in Spring 2017 at the Graduate School of Education that provides support for undocumented students and educates their peers on issues related to immigration. Ariana Aparicio Aguilar, the co-chair of UndocuAllies, said she, too, supports consolidating resources across campus.
"It would be nice in some way to integrate the legal team that we have and the resources that are available at Harvard," she said. "I think it would be a great reminder for the students who are still here and were here when the previous president was here, and for the new students to know, kind of like that reassurance that the new president also stands by them."
Act on a Dream advocacy co-chair Laura S. Veira-Ramirez ’20 said she hopes the new administration will look to reconsider policies that have been rejected in the past.
“We pushed for a sanctuary campus two years ago, but Drew Faust did not approve that, so that would be another possibility for under new leadership to reconsider, especially now that DACA has actually been rescinded,” she said.
Faust announced in Dec. 2016 that Harvard would not be a "sanctuary campus," citing concerns that the label could actually draw the federal government's attention to the University's undocumented students.

Correction: Sept. 12, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that 80,000 undocumented youth are currently protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. In fact, 800,000 undocumented youth are protected under the program.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In March, the NFL approved a change to its policy on hits to the head. Under the revised rule, “players who lead with the crown of their helmets to initiate contact against an opponent on any play” will incur automatic 15-yard penalties for their respective teams and may be ejected from the game “depending on the severity of the hit” according to an NFL.com article from March 27.
There is still no targeting rule in place, which in the college game results in an automatic ejection for any player who is deemed to have led with his helmet in making a hit. However, it appears as though the NFL is trending in that direction.
In a week one game featuring the Cincinnati Bengals and the Indianapolis Colts, we witnessed the first ejection under these new guidelines. The pocket collapsed around Colts quarterback Andrew Luck, and he darted up the middle to escape pressure from the Bengals’ defense. Just as Luck gained a first down, he was brought down from behind by defensive end Michael Johnson. At the same time, safety Shawn Williams entered the frame and dove headlong, making contact with Luck’s helmet as he was dragged down to the turf. Williams was disqualified from the contest.
When the footage is replayed, it is clear that Johnson also had to dive to tackle Luck and the play was not a guarantee to be made. Williams, then, appears somewhat justified when he stated post-game that the helmet-to-helmet contact was incidental. If Johnson had not made the play and Luck were still running, Williams’ dive would have positioned him around Luck’s midsection for a textbook tackle. However, the helmet-to-helmet contact appeared to be exactly what the competition committee had in mind back in March — incidental contact is still punishable, and leading with the head will get you penalized or ejected more often than not.
The American Professional Football Alliance, which would eventually become the National Football League, was born in 1920. In 1932, the NFL established its own rules committee, which differentiated it slightly from the version of the sport being played at the collegiate level. In 1966, the NFL began its merger with the American Football League and hosted the first Super Bowl.
Due to time and rules changes like the one above, the sport that captivates fans every fall and winter is wildly different than the one that evolved in the early 20th century. It is generally accepted that many of the alterations have made football safer for players, but recently player safety has become a deep concern due to studies that have linked playing the sport to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).
NFL fans and even players themselves appear to be split on this issue. On one hand, is it wrong to reject changes to the sport that could protect players’ lives and minds years in the future? On the other hand, at what point is football not football anymore?
The first question appears to have more merit. The wellbeing of those who play football should be one of the top priorities, if not the top priority, of any league. However, to remain viable at all, a league needs to sell tickets and merchandise and attract television viewers. Will football become unrecognizable and fall by the wayside if it continues to adopt too many new rules?
My opinion is that it will not. A look at the college game shows that increasing penalties for dangerous contact does not detract from the quality of the product on the field. Every fall, there are targeting penalties called in Harvard games, and they never seem to cause much of a stir either in the broadcast booth or down in the stands.
Violence is inherent, and even celebrated, in some sports. It is not an essential requirement, but fans are often attracted to brutal hits and physical clashes between opposing teams. However, football still has plenty of contact to go around even if hits to the head — or hits using the head — are penalized. These hits will always happen, either accidentally or intentionally, but updating the rules to reflect our current understanding of player safety is a must: it will cut down on dangerous plays, and it most likely will not cause the collapse of football as we know it.

In the frantic chaos of college packing, your parents might have tried to tell you how to do laundry, only for it to be lost in the shuffle. Unfortunately, now that you’ve finally made it, there’s suddenly no one to do your laundry (unless, of course, you want to splurge on door delivery). Since you ignored everyone’s attempts to teach you (whoops), at this point you can’t exactly go groveling back for advice. That’s where we come in: here’s our official guide to doing your laundry at Harvard.
Laundry ain't free
In fact, it’s $1.50 for the washer and another $1.50 for the dryer, so prepare to spend your coffee money on laundry instead. You can pay for this using quarters, or you can simply load Crimson Cash onto your Harvard ID. Just make sure you swipe the narrow strip of your ID at the little black box in the laundry room and you’re good to go. And after you swipe to pay for it, don’t forget to go back and press the start button on the machine! (We have made this mistake before, and have had to pay another regrettable $1.50.)
Rub a dub dub
Laundry machines don’t come with magical soap included, so you’ll have to spring for that as well. If you’ve brought some Tide Pods with you to snack on, good news: they can also be used for laundry! Just pop one or two right in the washer, and you’re ready to wash. For liquid detergent, pour a capful into the detergent drawer along the top of the washer.
To separate or not to separate
If you have white or bright-colored clothing that you care a lot about, you’ll probably want to separate your laundry into whites/brights and darker colors before you wash so that the colors don’t bleed. If you, like the average college student, can’t be bothered to do two separate loads, that’s perfectly fine. No judgement, just wash it all together on cold.
Tick tock on the clock 
The Harvard washers take about 35 minutes and the dryers take about an hour. If you leave your laundry in the washer or dryer for more than a few hours, you’re well on your way to making laundry enemies instead of laundry buddies. Do yourself a favor and just set a timer on your phone. There’s also a helpful site called LaundryView which lets you see which machines are in use and how much time they have left—just search for Harvard Undergraduate Housing on the “find your school” page and look for your dorm.
Hint o’ lint
Lastly, before you throw your clothes in the dryer, make sure to check and clean off the lint screen just inside the door of the dryer. If the screens don’t get cleaned periodically, all of the fuzz from your clothes can build up, leading to damp clothes or even dryer fires (yikes). Pro tip: if you don’t want to get your fingers all up in dust, lint, and whatever else is on the clothes of your whole dorm, carry a card to scrape the screen with.
While laundry may not be among the most exciting of activities that Harvard has to offer, your roommates and the rest of the world will appreciate it if you do your due diligence. There’s no use in letting it pile up, so gather up your hampers, load that Crimson Cash, and ready your Tide Pods: it’s laundry time.
