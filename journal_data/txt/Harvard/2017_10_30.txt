After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fun fact: I have never been trick-or-treating on Halloween. In elementary school, I never went to class on that day either, because all that happened was a Halloween party. My family would usually go out for Chinese food and a movie instead. Halloween was an objectionable “holiday” to us as Christians with its celebration of the grotesque and macabre and pagan. It was never just about free candy or a party, and to this day I find Halloween eerie and chilling.
October 31 is particularly significant this year, though. It will mark exactly 500 years since Martin Luther allegedly hammered 95 theses onto the wall of the Wittenburg Church in Germany, sparking the Protestant Reformation, a religious firestorm whose heat we can still feel today. Some Christians find this event a cause for celebration, while others lament it.
One lamentable consequence of the Reformation was the splintering of Christianity into many denominations and sects. Division and conflict among believers, especially between Catholics and Protestants, have exacted heavy costs and brought about the very opposite of Christian ministry. Sectionalism need not always manifest itself in outright violence or abstract theological dispute, though. I was once accused, albeit somewhat light-heartedly, by a Catholic acquaintance of not even belonging to Christ because I’m not Catholic. We’re still friends, of course, but that stung in the moment.
Every Christian professes the same core truth: that Jesus Christ is Lord. So how can it be that we share such a profound first principle, yet depart so far from one another? Did Martin Luther only fracture and condemn the church he wanted to rescue from itself?
I don’t think I can draw a complete picture of my thinking on this matter yet. I’m certainly not well-versed enough in the finer aspects of Christian theology to outline my thoughts very systematically. The Reformation remains as much a personal matter of faith as an institutional challenge, though my thoughts are less thesis-like than reflective in nature.
I was baptized as an infant and grew up Christian, and was confirmed after studying Luther’s Small Catechism and the Apostle’s Creed. It wasn’t until coming to Harvard that I felt I had truly claimed my faith as my own, and that the Christian Gospel was transforming me in a way that Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and his memes could not.
I have discovered fellowship and community in Harvard’s faith groups that I could never find in my middle school and high school youth groups, and I am blessed to live with four amazing and wonderful Christian women (both Catholic and Protestant) who have deepened my faith and brought immeasurable joy into my life.
As my faith has grown stronger, my questions have grown larger. As I’ve probed the nature of this issue and other questions surrounding the Christian Church, I’ve found myself returning over and over again to the idea of orthodoxy. I’ve begun to probe more deeply into the theological underpinnings of my family’s Lutheran roots, as well as those of Roman Catholicism.
The words orthodoxy, doctrine, and dogma tend to have unbelievably negative connotations in our modern conscience, but they are meant to be valuable tools to help us understand the Bible, Christian teachings and ways of life, and each other.
American mainstream Protestantism, in my view, might do well at this moment to return to a conception of orthodoxy. Growing up, I often felt failed by loose non-denominationalism that tried to sell and market Christianity to me, as if the Gospel could be tweaked and adjusted for a particular target audience. I wandered through a sea of various small groups and youth programs, finding no real spiritual sustenance in any of them. I did not and will never want the kind of therapeutic moral deism that tells me that, “Yeah, there probably is a God, and if there is, he would want you to be happy and love others! Just be a good person, you know?”
No! If anyone seeks true faith, comfort, or solace, they will never be satisfied with such shallowness. They will seek deeper truths even if those truths are hard to bear. They will yearn for something firm, something grounded. That is, at present, where I stand, a Protestant standing on the banks of the Tiber looking at the Roman Catholic communion, reflecting on what the Reformation means to us now. I’ll tell you more about the view next time.

Rarely do Harvard students talk about loneliness. We’ll gladly discuss commonalities: the p-set due this morning, perpetual lack of sleep, yesterday’s consulting event, the three midterms we had on the same day last week, the shuttle’s propensity to always run late.
Yet loneliness is everywhere. A freshman at Cornell University recently created a video talking about her experiences struggling to fit in on a campus without any friends or social support. In the New York Times, columnist Frank Bruni reported on the “scourge” of loneliness that pervades campuses. While these insights put loneliness on the map more broadly, they only begin to skim the surface as to why it occurs on an interpersonal level.
Three years ago, Crimson columnist Andrew D. Kim ’14 reflected on “how much easier it is to tell someone that you are depressed than to say that you are lonely at Harvard.” Despite the prevalence of loneliness at Harvard, the topic remains a taboo—a wound better covered up by a smile and a simple “I’m fine!” Conversations are rarely the red flags they need to be, as students all too quickly find themselves suffocating under tidal waves of solitude.
Harvard is a lonely place for many reasons. One theory is that students are fierce individualists, and seeking help fuels concerns that they may be interpreted as bothersome; the fear of being perceived as weak or friendless takes precedence over the fear of loneliness. Another theory holds that students are not genuine with each other, an insincerity born out of a sense of competition that views friends as “utility-maximizers” in the race to get ahead.
There are as many theories as lonely people on campus. But the subtle yet pervasive culture of competition and autonomy seems to be the commonality that leads to the degradation of friendships in lieu of connections and overworking in place of self-care.
This is a multifaceted issue, impossible to solve with a one-size-fits-all solution. But no matter how we view it, Harvard’s problem of loneliness is unacceptable. We must work together to de-stigmatize the notion that being and feeling lonely makes us a failure. Too many of us suffer from this common issue to simply pretend it does not exist.
“I DIDN’T FEEL LIKE I WAS PRESENT, EVER”
For Shelby J. Martinez ’18, leaving Harvard was the best way to fight loneliness. Her story is one that has happened countless times before, and it begins with a familiar narrative.
At first, Martinez didn’t even experience loneliness. “My freshman year I felt very much like an outlier. A lot of my friends told me how lonely they felt,” Martinez said. But over the course of that year, the specter of loneliness grew, brewing on the back burner until time inevitably forced its presence to be known. By her sophomore fall, she felt emotionally isolated, despite being surrounded by multitudes of people around Harvard.
“I didn’t feel like I was present. Ever. I always felt like I was acting out the routine. I never felt like I was making emotional connections with anyone, and if I had an issue, I either shoved it in the back of my own emotional closet or I just didn’t tell anybody because everyone else was so busy.”
Martinez’s loneliness drove her to put Harvard on pause during junior spring as she made self-care and emotional well-being her top priority. Yet the way she avoided seeking help speaks volumes. How many of us have chosen to keep issues to ourselves because we are afraid to “bother” others, or afraid to appear “unlikeable or socially maladapted,” to quote Kim?
One way to solve this is by breaking down the stigma around asking for help. We all know there is a stigma, but feeling the need to seek help is not a failing, no matter what we may think. We may think that our peers are smarter and better than us. But loneliness is not always obvious—some people are just better at hiding it than others. It is easy to dismiss the popular student always surrounded by friends in the dining hall as someone far removed from loneliness, but he or she may be surrounded by their own demons.
A PROBLEM OF UTILITY
Harvard’s social life is often hierarchical, predicated upon social connections and networking. This predatory view of social relationships can be daunting to freshmen, who may enter campus believing that they have to make certain friends in order to ensure success at, and after, Harvard.
The majority of Harvard students arrive on campus with few connections. Three-quarters of the Class of 2017 were the only ones from their high school to enroll at Harvard. While Martinez may have hidden her struggles from her friends to not bother them, others may hide from “friends” because they don’t want to risk further isolation.
Harvard is known for being a networking mecca, but this attitude can often spill over from finance events into the dorms. People are commonly used as social capital, a goal to check off from the to-do list. This makes defining relationships between people tricky—is this a friendship or is this a social stepping stone, a transactional interaction that holds little weight, a meal that will never be grabbed?
“I get the sense that a lot of Harvard students tend to view friendships as utility-maximizing tools rather than as genuine interactions between other people,” says Kenneth Shinozuka ’20. “And I think that mentality fosters a sort of community where friendships are built on a very tenuous basis, and it’s unclear whether or not somebody wants to be your friend simply to be your friend, or to use the social connections you have.”
This is well-documented in certain Harvard circles. Some make friends not for who they are but for the clubs or societies they are in. Using these connections to tether themselves more broadly across the campus, these “friendships” may only serve the purpose of moving up social and even professional ladders. For the rest of us, friendships may not necessarily be tied to concerns of popularity and self-image, but they can still be similarly superficial—never moving past a study group or club acquaintance.
Real friendships do exist on campus, but there are also many “friendships” that are meant to serve as vehicles to prestige and respect. Even if many of us do have deep friendships and don’t actively engage in this, we likely know many that do—and participating in these kinds of interactions can precipitate feelings of isolation and superficiality.
“At Harvard, it’s easy to have these fake friendships with people, like the ‘oh-let’s-grab-a-meal-sometimes’ friendships,” said Martinez. “Sometimes those are the only strong lifelines you have. And so when those fake and superficial relationships are all you have, and you feel like you’re breaking, there’s nothing that you have. There’s nothing to really catch you when you fall.”
We hide ourselves behind a mask to interact with others, even though they are also hiding, crouching behind their own makeshift facades for fear of jeopardizing this network. If we continue choosing to conceal our loneliness for fear of losing whatever tenuous connections we’ve made, our anxieties will only turn inward.
AMBITION AND ANTI-SOCIAL MEDIA
It is possible that loneliness may arise from more innocuous actions. It is well-documented that social media is tied to greater feelings of loneliness. On a campus where it often seems like half the students in any given lecture are browsing Facebook and Twitter, it makes sense that loneliness would be more prevalent. This is not unique to Harvard but to our generation as a whole.
We come from all across the country and all around the globe to pursue the opportunities found around Harvard Yard. And yet we choose to remain comfortable in the confines of our Facebook feeds. This is not to generalize the student body’s struggles at large, but it presents another way in which our lifestyles invite isolation.
“When you go on Facebook [and] Instagram, people are always posting what makes them look the best, right?” asks Victor C. Agbafe ’19. Agbafe is an Undergraduate Council representative for Dunster House who has supported efforts and projects by the UC to make students more aware of the struggles others face. “And...because of all the accomplishments people have, you think, ‘Wow, everyone’s so perfect! Am I really worth it, am I really worthy here?’ You start to question your validity as a human being.”
Martinez agrees. She said the feeling was like “[s]omething’s wrong with you, or [that] I’m not doing college right, or I’m not putting enough effort, or I’m putting the effort into the wrong thing.” Questions like these naturally arise within us. “Imposter syndrome” is well-documented on Harvard’s campus. Yet Facebook—ironically a creation of Harvard—has exacerbated this problem.
It is easy enough to say, “Get off Facebook and go outside,” as so many counsel. While we encourage students to follow this approach, as it does have benefits, we understand that it may trivialize many deep-seated issues that others face. And overall, it is incredibly hard to pencil in time to commit to friendships in our perpetually-filled calendars. It is easier for us to isolate ourselves in our rooms or Lamont Library and absorb ourselves in schoolwork and Facebook. But we do so at our own peril.
FILTERING THROUGH RESOURCES
There is a critical need to pay attention to the effects of loneliness among the student body. A Crimson analysis of students’ mental health reported that 40 percent of the College utilized mental health services. Data collected from the recent Class of 2021 survey indicated that 21 percent underwent mental health counseling, a number that has dramatically risen since the Class of 2017’s reported 12.5 percent.
Despite the enormity of Harvard’s problem with loneliness, and its intersections with issues of mental health, there are signs of hope and substantive student action. Groups such as the Unfiltered Project at Harvard are doing a stellar job in showcasing the issues of Harvard students to the wider community, using the wide-ranging vehicles of social media to affect positive change and reflection among ourselves.
Other groups—such as Room 13 and QuadTalk—are available for students to unburden themselves of deep-seated issues to confidential peer counselors. The benefits of having these resources to take advantage of without the fear of being judged is invaluable. But while these peer groups must be commended for the great strides they make, we need more student-run initiatives that make us feel comfortable empathizing or confiding with each other.
While we commend the students who devote their time to peer counseling and other initiatives and encourage others to do so, the College must also assist us. The administration does realize that loneliness is a major problem, and accordingly tries to fix it at the start of our Harvard experience—freshman year.
The Freshman Dean’s Office programming during Opening Days hosts many events, not just large-scale ones that are meant for the entire freshman class, but small-scale events within common rooms and proctor suites that help smaller groups get to know one another. This is vital to fostering more intimate connections among students who may have difficulty transitioning to Harvard, but it is not always effective. Transitioning to Harvard’s unique environment is hard, and for many, its effects stretch far past freshman fall.
These events are often replicated in the Houses, but with varying degrees of success—some Houses are known for having a more communal atmosphere than others, leading students to potentially seek social life elsewhere or to eschew it completely. The College must support student- and House-led efforts, and it should be commended for its efforts to do so in the past.
But sometimes, campus resources aren’t enough, or fail to live up to their purported utility. Martinez can be the first to attest to this: “I reached out to CAMHS and they were completely unhelpful. We chatted about Lemonade for 30 minutes and [the counselor] texted me fanfiction to read during my session.”
Though it cannot be claimed that Martinez’s experience is the norm, the fact that it happened speaks volumes. Despite having real concerns, her experience was trivialized, something that could be ‘solved’ through a frivolous conversation and some cheeky readings. Despite the seemingly abundant amount of options for support, these resources failed her. We cannot allow this to continue happening.
Similarly, while the opportunity for students to utilize the expanse of campus resources is important, many peer counseling groups don't quite encompass loneliness within the scope of their work. The statistics shown above demonstrate the need to pay attention to loneliness and to tackle it via peer counseling groups, lest its frequency continue to increase throughout students’ time here and lead to other mental health issues.
TEARING DOWN BARRIERS
Loneliness is universal. It does not discriminate. And it unfortunately is a keystone of the sought-after Harvard experience that isn’t publicized in glossy brochures. Unknowingly yet despondently, many Harvard students find themselves falling prey to this overwhelming sensation. We fear our endeavors aren’t enough―that the friends we surround ourselves with are constantly doing more than we could ever hope to do. These thoughts persist despite our best attempts to eliminate them.
We are aware that everyone’s experience of loneliness is unique; in many cases, it is tied to issues of mental health, such as depression. But regardless of the cause, we must continue to place student mental health and self-care as our top priority on campus by tearing down the social barriers we have created. We should be able to achieve the challenging goals we set for ourselves without falling prey to loneliness. Seeking for help does not make us weak, but stronger, for giving us the courage to admit and work through our problems.
After all, Harvard is supposed to be a place of transformation. Yet, instead of transforming only ourselves, we must transform our relationships with each other. We must see each other as fellow students experiencing the same issues, not as strangers meant to be exploited. There is no cookie-cutter solution to this, but we should do as Kim suggested years ago: Go up to someone, and say: “‘I feel lonely sometimes. Do you?’”
In the end, we are here for more than just education or knowledge. We are here for the unforgettable experiences with friends and classmates that can’t be made anywhere else. We can’t afford to spend our four years at Harvard in isolation—not when there is so much to learn from one another.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ever since the announcement—by virtue of a magnanimous $400 million gift from John A. Paulson—of an expansion to Allston slated to begin in 2020, Harvard affiliates have observed the evolution of the up-and-coming School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. The school currently stands at a pivotal point in its history—straddling its past and present—and its leadership and that of the University  are molding its future before our eyes.
For one, there have been various positive waypoints since the announcement of SEAS’s expansion to Allston.  We have witnessed the recruitment of eight professors in 2015 and six new professors in 2017 with hopefulness. They will broaden the purview of research at Harvard, provide more opportunities for mentorship for undergraduates, and propel SEAS toward wider recognition. After all, it is the minds of students and  academics that make Harvard into the school it is, rather than potential glitzy new campuses.
Nevertheless, buildings are indispensable, not because they are an end in and of themselves, but because it is apparent that SEAS’s current location is causing it considerable growing pains. SEAS affiliates have said that Pierce Hall—the current center of SEAS, built more than a century ago in 1901—is too cramped at the moment. This not only inconveniences current SEAS affiliates, but also impedes Harvard’s efforts to recruit and retain future faculty, highlighting the need for the new campus. Fortunately, it appears that, as of last month, construction has moved smoothly and is still on time,  so SEAS affiliates will only need to face these constraints for only one more full academic year.
Not all of the news coming out of SEAS, however, has been positive. In the past fiscal year, of the $11.7 million deficit incurred by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, $9.1 million was due to the SEAS deficit. Though we are loath to shrug off University financial difficulties, we do also acknowledge—as argued by  SEAS Dean Francis J. Doyle III—that the near coincidence of a financial crisis and the construction of a new campus are likely to pose unique challenges to SEAS’s coffers. We hope that this will not become a perpetual state of affairs, and we stress again the primacy of financial well-being to the University’s continued flourishing.
In light of the current strategic importance of SEAS’s position, we believe that the next University President should concentrate on sustaining SEAS’s growth. He or she must be attentive to the school’s needs and any hurdles it may face in expanding to the new campus. As argued by Computer Science professor Harry R. Lewis ’68, this does not mean that the next president must be an engineer. Current University President Drew G. Faust, a historian by training, has deftly shepherded the new campus into existence. If anything, a president without an engineering background will help to assure that SEAS pursues the University’s liberal arts mission to produce well-rounded graduates.
In sum, we believe that the future is bright for engineering at Harvard. If it continues along its current trajectory and fulfills its promise, Harvard and society at large will enjoy the innovation and technical prowess of SEAS engineers for many years to come.

Thousands of alumni, students, and faculty crowded Harvard Law School’s lecture halls and meeting rooms Friday for a full day of sessions with senators, judges, and renowned legal scholars to celebrate the school’s 200th birthday.
The Law School, which was founded in 1817, has already hosted a series of events this year celebrating this milestone. This weekend’s summit was its largest bicentennial event yet, featuring 62 sessions Friday and an opening ceremony with six current and former Supreme Court Justices on Thursday.
Richard Lazarus, a Law School professor and the chair of the bicentennial programming, said the aim of the event was to celebrate the Law School with action, rather than reflection.
“The basic aim and goal of the October summit is basically to celebrate the Law School, but not to celebrate the Law School by reflecting on how wonderful Harvard Law School is, but by kind of being wonderful,” Lazarus said.
To that end, the Law School packed the day’s schedule with notable alumni and faculty presenters including five senators, former U.S. Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch ’81, and federal judge Merrick B. Garland ’74, among many others.
Virginia Senator and 2016 Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim M. Kaine, who graduated from the Law School in 1983, praised the practical skills he learned during his time in Cambridge.
“I had a lot of classes from super brainy theoreticians, but I was a nuts and bolts civil rights trial lawyer in the South for 17 years,” Kaine said. “When I think of Harvard, I think ‘what a great trade school.’ You guys gave me some really practical things that I was able to turn into this cool civil rights and public service career.”
Mass. Senator Elizabeth Warren recalled her path to Harvard later in her career as a professor after earning her earlier degrees at public institutions. She said Law School professor Charles Fried had called her when after she had guest-taught at Harvard for a year and was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Law School. Fried told her that Harvard was the place where she could make the largest impact.
“And that was the answer,” Warren said. “I came to Harvard and got deeper into the fights. It’s a bigger place to be making an impact, and every day I got to walk into the classroom and say ‘get better at what you’ve got.’”
Garland, who was nominated to the Supreme Court by former President Barack Obama, presided over a re-argument of the landmark Marbury v. Madison Supreme Court case. Law School Professor Laurence H. Tribe ’62 and his former student Kathleen M. Sullivan, a veteran Supreme Court litigator veteran, argued the case.
Rebecca A. Vastola, a first-year law student who attended the Senators’ event, said that the focus on government and public interest speakers was especially appealing to her.
“I think it’s an incredible opportunity, for those of us that this is corresponding with our first year at Harvard,” Vastola said. “I think a lot of the Law School and classroom time is really focused on practicing and firms and working in business and I think this is a great opportunity for the people who are more focused on work in government or public interest to get to see some of our heros.”
The bicentennial celebrations continue throughout the year, featuring a number of events, including a public service day in April.

The Cambridge Police Department arrested a homeless man, formerly from Arlington, for a stabbing in Harvard Square last Sunday night, hours after the close of the Head of the Charles Regatta.
Twenty-five year old Anthony Wall was taken into custody around 10 a.m. on Oct. 26 and will be charged with armed assault with intent to murder in Cambridge District Court. CPD picked him up at Palmer St. and Brattle St., near the Harvard Coop.
CPD responded to reports of a stabbing just before 11:30 p.m. on Oct. 22 near Church St. and Massachusetts Ave. At the time of response, the victim, a 30 year old homeless man, was uncooperative with the police investigation and stated that “he would be taking care of the situation himself,” the responding officers wrote in the police report. According to Jeremy Warnick, spokesperson for CPD, the two parties “were known to each other.”
The victim, who is also from Arlington, was hospitalized for “extensive internal injuries” possibly to the heart and lungs, which caused significant blood loss, police wrote in the report.
According to Warnick, the victim was in a stable condition last Monday after undergoing surgery.
On Thursday, CPD responded to reports of a possible fight on Church St. In an email to The Crimson, Warnick wrote that the incident was an unrelated verbal argument between two male parties and was quickly settled.
The police investigated a similar incident on Church St. in Mar. 2016, when a victim sustained a non-fatal stab wound to the lower abdomen after an argument escalated.
More recently, a local restaurant employee and Harvard Business School student were stabbed near John F. Kennedy Park early last month, in an unprovoked assault. The suspect has since been arrested and charged with two counts of armed assault to murder in Cambridge.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Scientists, journalists, and public officials discussed methods for preventing a variety of global epidemics, including infectious diseases and gun violence, at the Contagion symposium held at the Knafel Center on Friday.
Featuring three panels in total, the symposium primarily focused on novel methods for tracking epidemics and was hosted by the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.
“There are a lot of new tools from epidemiological research to combat these threats,” said Janet Rich-Edwards, an associate professor of medicine at the Medical School and the event's organizer.
The first session focused on research-based techniques to forecast infectious disease.
MIT Assistant Media Arts and Sciences Professor Kevin M. Esvelt discussed his research in the field of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats “gene drive” technology, which he first began in 2013.  As a result of his research, Esvelt identified the possibility of editing DNA segments to alter wild populations of organisms.
Currently, he is working on a project which aims to prevent tick-borne disease. Eventually, he hopes to utilize his gene drive research to prompt scientists to take a more modern approach to research.
Scholars explicated the importance of forecasting epidemics in the second panel, called “Big Data”.
University of Nevada Professor James M. Wilson called for an organization akin to the National Weather Service for predicting infectious disease.
He said he has not found the current state of infectious disease forecasting to be adequate. “We’ve been playing games for decades and it’s very unfortunate,” he said.
C. Jessica Metcalf, another panelist and Princeton professor, discussed recent measles outbreaks and echoed Wilson’s call, envisioning a “global immunological observatory.”
The final panel focused on social epidemics, ranging from mental illness to the opioid crisis.
“Contagion, you think of as being a part of infectious disease epidemics,” said Rich-Edwards. “But we were interested in broadening that idea, or turning it on its head, to also understand contagion as the root of many social ills.”
One panelist, Yale professor Andrew Papachristos talked about using network science—models of complex phenomena—to study gun violence among civilians and police. In his research, he found that networks of police gun violence can be mapped into clusters, just as networks of non-violence can be mapped into clusters.
Rich-Edwards said the symposium showcased research methods that were new to many of the expert attendees.
“I learned about new methods of disease forecasting. I heard a really heartening call for open science and transparency that particularly came from the young researchers,” she said.
In a speech at the symposium’s conclusion, Laurie Garrett, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and Senior Fellow for Global Health at the Council on Foreign Relations, urged the media to “put biology first” when reporting epidemics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduates are looking to bring back ‘Harvard Time,’ extend Thanksgiving break, fund class-wide programming for upperclassmen, and designate physical space towards a multicultural center as the deadline approaches to add referenda to the Undergraduate Council’s presidential election ballot.
UC referenda are meant to gauge student opinion on various campus issues. In the past, they have ranged from serious—such as one asking for student input on Harvard’s Title IX policies—to lighthearted, such as a proposal to make the “Harvard Turkey” the University’s official mascot.
Students must have 650 signatures on an initial interest form by midnight on Nov. 5 in order for their questions to appear on the ballot.
Although the College extended Thanksgiving break to include the Wednesday before the holiday in 2011, Daniel J. Kenny ’18 is seeking to extend the break to include the Monday and Tuesday before Thanksgiving in his referendum question. Kenny said he hopes that, if successful, the referendum will demonstrate student support for extending the break.
According to Kenny, many at the College seem enthusiastic about the proposal.
“It’s something I’ve discussed with a few of my friends, and anyone I brought it up to seemed to be very supportive of it,” he said. “I figure the best way to make this schedule change is to just sort of show that students want this.”
The petition has already garnered at least 860 signatures, according to Kenny, passing the threshold to appear on the ballot next month.
Other students, like Adams House representative Nicholas P. Whittaker ’19 and Leverett House representative Salma Abdelrahman ’20, are seeking to include a question about a physical space for students that promotes “Diversity, Belonging, and Inclusion.” Whittaker said he and Abdelrahman’s proposed referendum has “over half” of the necessary signatures.
Whittaker said he hopes this referendum sparks “tangible” change in addressing concerns of diversity at Harvard.
“We’ve been talking a lot about diversity and inclusion on campus. The administration has done a lot of things. They've made a lot of committees and task reports and stuff. I think a lot of things that kind of feel intangible to students,” he said.
Another question vying for a spot on the ballot asks students whether the Faculty of Arts and Sciences should preserve “Harvard Time,” the seven minute grace period between classes that FAS struck down earlier this year in favor of a new course schedule that will set in fall 2018. Eli W. Russell ’20 sponsored the referendum.
Quincy House representative Wyatt M. Robertson ’18 proposed a fourth question about funding “inclusive class-wide programming” for sophomores and juniors. Robertson said he was inspired to propose the question by the lack of class-wide programming outside of freshmen and senior year.
“At Harvard, your freshman year is really fun, you get to spend it with your class, but then I feel like the College somewhat forgets that you’re part of a larger class, instead of Houses, for the rest of your time at Harvard until senior year,” he said.
In the past, others have hosted programming of this kind. In April, for example, Caie C. Kelley ’18—an inactive Crimson editor—and Berkeley Brown ’18 held a junior year reflection event for members of the Class of 2018. The year prior, Brown and Madeleine H. Stern ’18 threw a concentration declaration event for sophomores in Annenberg Hall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hundreds of parents and siblings, donning spirited Crimson attire, descended on Harvard Yard this weekend to visit members of the Class of 2021 during the College’s Freshman Family Weekend.
With a calendar full of family-friendly events and a selection of Snapchat filters to document the weekend, students and parents say they were happy to reunite on campus.
Emily M. Spector ’21 said she reserved the entire weekend to spend with her family, attempting to complete schoolwork in advance to prepare.
“I intend to spend Friday or Saturday night binge watching ‘Grey’s Anatomy’ with my mom,” she said. “And, if I suffer a little bit Sunday night doing work because of that, I’m fine with that.”
For Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, Freshman Family Weekend provides an opportunity to get to know more about his students.
“One of the great privileges in my life is to have an opportunity to work with our students. Helping share this journey with families and guardians, meeting them, and thanking them for their children is one of the goals that we have for this weekend,” he said.
While visiting, families had the chance to attend events, open houses, campus tours, a football game, and to sit in on classes. Many students also took the weekend as a chance to explore Harvard Square and Square businesses with their families.
“We are having a great experience: We love the tailgate party, went to the chemistry class in Science Center. It was interesting,” said Rhonda Scott, the mother of Harris Scott ’21.
During a panel advising parents on how to navigate their child’s transition to College, speakers informed families of the many resources on campus to help freshmen acclimate, such as the Freshman Dean’s Office and the Bureau of Study Council.
Sheila Flynn, the mother of Sarah K. Flynn ’21, said she found the event insightful. Flynn added that the panel’s tips for parents as their return home for winter break were especially helpful.
“I understand that [my daughter] is going to be tired, and she has her own plans, but her roots are at home,” Flynn said.
While many enjoyed relaxing time with parents and siblings, others had family that could not visit. Expecting that some could not make the trip to Cambridge, the College held events to support students without visitors, such as an Undergraduate Council-sponsored dinner with faculty for students without family in town.
And since the weekend took place shortly before Halloween, students could also pass time at festive events themed around the spooky holiday.
“This weekend I’m probably going to hang out with friends, go to some of the events of cultural clubs that I’m in, and go out on the weekend,” said Sahil S. Lauji ’21, whose family did not attend Freshman Family Weekend.
Other freshmen said they did not feel it was productive to invite family to campus, given their busy schedules and impending exams.
“I just don’t think it would not be worthwhile for [my parents] to travel here for the weekend,” said Simon Arango Baquero ’21.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Stan A. Veuger, an economic analyst from the American Enterprise Institute, spoke about congressional deadlock and the Trump administration’s legislative agenda at the CGIS Knafel building Friday.
The seminar, titled “Health Care and Tax Reform in the 115th Congress,” was part of a larger lecture series in the Program on Constitutional Government, which brings visiting professors to Harvard, hosts guest speakers, and sponsors postdoctoral fellowships. Harvey C. Mansfield ’53, one of the founders of the program and a professor in the Government department, moderated the talk.
Veuger analyzed the progress of healthcare and tax reform under President Donald Trump, reflecting on several failed attempts by GOP leadership to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. He said the effort will continue to be a priority for the party.
“They spent seven years claiming it is the worst piece of domestic legislation in history,” he said.  “It would be really weird to now just walk away from it and say... ‘It was actually the best we could come up with.’”
He also discussed competing visions for tax reform in the Republican Party. After his lecture, he took questions from the audience about the future of healthcare and tax legislation.
The event was attended by faculty members and students. Malcolm J. Reid ’21 said he was drawn to the discussion because of Mansfield.
“I’m kind of a fan of Harvey Mansfield, so it’s always nice to get a chance to see him,” Reid said.
He added that he respected Veuger’s “ability to be as critical of the people in power as he was.”
The Program on Constitutional Government will host more lunchtime seminars over the course of the semester. The next seminar is titled “The Artist as Citizen: How could anyone quibble with that?”and will bring the Washington Post’s chief art and architecture critic Philip Kennicott to campus.

Advanced technology could better allow low-income people to access financial services, a global non-profit representative told an audience at the Kennedy School on Friday.
Victoria White, managing director of global advisory solutions at Accion International, spoke about the organization's mission to use digital tools to make financial services more available and affordable.
Many charities focus their efforts on microloans, White said, but she believes financial inclusion requires a wider range of services.
“We define financial inclusion as not just access to a [bank] account and not just access to credit either, but a full array of products… to have a safe place to save and to be able to send money to a family member in a way that is safe and affordable,” she said.
White said Accion’s financial services support not only small businesses, but also the housing, education, and healthcare expenses of their owners.
She explained how Accion’s partner organizations, many of which are well-established commercial financial service institutions, use technology to make an impact on low-income communities around the world.
For example, Indian microfinance company Aye Finance uses an innovative digital system to collect client information and analyze data. DAWN, a microfinance company in Myanmar, is devising a “mobile wallet” program so clients who lack access to banks can use their smartphones to transfer money and access other financial services.
Many of the audience members at Friday’s event were Kennedy School students. Second-year student at the Kennedy School Rodrigo Garcia said the topics covered were “too general” to be of much assistance.
Second-year student Akinwande Lalude said he was excited about the potential of Accion, but he questioned the sustainability of Accion’s business model.
“My biggest takeaway is that there is a ton of opportunity to do activist lending in a lot of developing markets,” he said. “What we didn’t talk about, though, was the balance between doing service or creating impact and creating a sustainable solution.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Starting today and continuing through the Crimson’s season opener on Nov. 10 against MIT, men’s basketball beat writer Stephen Gleason will look at Harvard’s 13 nonconference opponents. To kick things off, coming in at No. 13 is MIT.
MIT
2017-2018 Matchup: Friday, Nov. 10 at Lavietes Pavilion (7:00 p.m.)
2016-2017 Record: 21-7 overall, 11-3 New England Women’s and Men’s Athletic Conference
Head Coach: Larry Anderson (23rd season)
Key Players: Junior guard Bradley Jomard (played in only 15 games but led team in minutes, scoring, and rebounding in those games); junior guard AJ Jurko (averaged nearly 12 points per game on 44.9 percent shooting from the field and 45 percent from three, averaged 4.8 rebounds to go with five assists)
Stat to Watch: 25: In Tommy Amaker’s five matchups against the Engineers, his teams have won by an average of 25 points per game, with the closest contest coming in 2012, when the Crimson prevailed, 69-54.
Analysis: While MIT returns virtually its entire team from a season ago and will likely bring a raucous student section when it makes the short trip to Lavietes Pavilion, Harvard’s size and balanced attack should prove too much for the Engineers to handle.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team, like every other Division I club, wants to improve upon last year’s results. When it comes to playing in its home rink, however, the Crimson has little room for error.
After cruising to an unbeaten record (13-0-2) at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center in 2016-2017, Harvard (1-0-0, 1-0-0 ECAC) dropped the puck against Ivy League rival Dartmouth (0-2-0, 0-1-0) on Sunday night hoping to impose a similar home-ice dominance.
The Crimson did just that, nabbing a 5-0 victory in the inaugural matchup of its new campaign. Hosting the Big Green marked the start of a three-game conference homestand that the Harvard icemen will use to prepare for a hefty road trip in November.
“We can play two scrimmages, but [the regular season] is different,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “[The Big Green] made some clever plays…early on, but then our depth started to show up a little bit and we were able to put some shifts together.”
While improving upon such a pristine home record is near impossible, the Crimson certainly wanted its first matchup with Dartmouth to go better than it did last season, with the team falling to the Big Green, 8-4. That blip is still Harvard’s most recent conference loss, as the squad remained loss-less for 18 games until its Frozen Four defeat in Chicago.
“Dartmouth has given us some trouble over the last couple of years,” coach Donato said. “So [it’s a] good win.”
During the opening minutes of the contest, it wasn’t clear whether the Crimson would cruise to victory as easily as it did. Dartmouth was ready to play from the opening faceoff—with a game already under its belt, the Big Green’s legs were churning and bodies were colliding.
The ice finally tilted in Harvard’s favor when, nine minutes in, freshman forward Henry Bowlby tallied his first career goal and his team’s first of the year.
Fellow rookie Jack Badini moved the puck to senior blue-liner Wiley Sherman, who fired a point shot on goal. Bowlby was there to redirect the puck, which found its way to the back of the net.
“Wiley doesn’t hesitate, he gets the shot off hard, and you get Bowlby right there in front and he just tips it,” tri-captain goaltender Merrick Madsen said. “From then on out I think it just set the tone and we were able to play with a little more ease.”
Once Bowlby found twine, the Crimson settled in and found its game. Before long, Harvard established the style of play fans grew accustomed to seeing last season. With the forwards skating aggressively, the home team hit pay dirt twice more in the opening frame of its season.
“I thought it was probably a little bit slower of a start than we would’ve liked,” Donato said. “After the first five or seven minutes, we started to get in on the forecheck and use our speed and keep some pucks alive…. After that we played a little bit better.”
Also in the first period, junior forwards and linemates Ryan Donato and Lewis Zerter-Gossage each struck against Big Green goaltender Devin Buffalo, who would later be pulled after ceding another snipe to Donato in the second frame.
Donato’s first goal of the night came shorthanded just before the first period horn. The Boston Bruins draft choice strode into the zone down the right side before picking a corner and besting Buffalo. Donato finished last season with a team-leading three tallies on the penalty kill, and it looks like he will continue to terrorize teams while man-down this year.
The junior, who has moved into the center spot from the wing last season, finished the game with two strikes. Donato played the role of special teams expert on Sunday, notching his second goal just eight seconds into the man-advantage in the middle period.
Faced with lingering questions about forward depth entering the season, the Crimson answered the critics in convincing fashion on Sunday. The usual suspects did their part—Donato, sophomore defenseman Adam Fox, Madsen, and others—while the freshmen made the most of their opportunities. Aside from Bowlby, rookie defenseman Reilly Walsh and forward Jack Badini each tallied an assist.
Walsh rounds out a daunting first power play unit for the Crimson. With offensive facilitators in Fox and Walsh manning both points—not to mention Donato’s looming presence at the right circle—opposing penalty kill units will not know where to start.
“Obviously we have a guy like [Fox]—he’s going to dominate any player on the power play,” Ryan Donato said. “[Walsh] is a great player, too. We have a lot of guys with talent.”
Sunday night, the Big Green predictably struggled with Harvard’s man-up unit, forfeiting the goal to Donato—assisted by Walsh and Fox—before yanking its net-minder in an act of capitulation.
While the Crimson’s season opener went poorly for Dartmouth’s starter, Madsen had a relatively quiet night in goal en route to a shutout. The chances that Madsen faced were not great in number, but they demanded quality saves to preserve the clean sheet.
“Overall, we had a good night in net,” coach Donato said. “Merrick very quietly made probably five to seven [very] good saves”
The Arizona Coyotes prospect seemed to pick up where he left off last season, after finishing atop the NCAA in wins and top-20 in both goals against average and save percentage. During his team’s road to the Frozen Four, Madsen’s win streak of 16 games was the longest in program history.
Madsen’s experienced defense, featuring sophomore standouts Fox and John Marino as well as senior pillar Wiley Sherman, will certainly help him build on last season’s success.
Ultimately, Madsen’s individual metrics will be reflections of the team’s play. And while Harvard picked up its first win of the season in a decisive manner on Sunday, the Crimson will need to continue polishing the details of its game in order to be ready for stiff competition throughout November and December.
“It was a pretty good team effort,” coach Donato said. “It wasn’t anything spectacular, it wasn’t a great game as far as the level of pace or skill…. We’ll have to improve against two good teams against next weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After 89 minutes and 11 saves from Kyle Parks, a bicycle kick from inside the box with 31 seconds remaining made the difference between Harvard and Dartmouth at the end of a hard-fought contest Saturday evening at Jordan Field.
With the last-minute goal, No. 19/20 Dartmouth (10-3-1, 3-0-1) put to rest any real chance of Harvard (2-8-4, 1-2-2 Ivy) winning the Ancient Eight this year and making the NCAA tournament. The Big Green, on the other hand, continued its strong season and vaulted to top of the conference standings with a 1-0 victory.
The game didn’t start well for the Crimson, after it was reduced to ten men early on, when freshman midfielder Paolo Belloni-Urso received a red card in the 35th minute. Belloni-Urso was yellow-carded after being on the field for only a few minutes, and was sent off after a mistiming a seemingly-tame challenge directly in front of the referee a few minutes later.
“I was really proud of the way the team fought, down a man most of the game,” senior midfielder Christian Sady said. “We didn’t have too many chances, but I thought we defended really hard and worked well together as a unit. It was really positive from everyone on the field, even though we didn’t get the result we wanted.”
This strong defensive display from Harvard was needed against its Ancient Eight foe, who boasts the country’s 10th best offense. The Big Green employed a direct style of play, often trying to find junior forwards Eduvie Ikoba and Justin Donawa on long balls over the top of the Crimson defense. Ikoba caused lots of problems with his strength, and at times Donawa found lots of time and space down the right flank.
As a result of the this pressure Dartmouth won nine of the game’s ten corner kicks. Many were dangerously sent into the box, but senior goalkeeper Kyle Parks was quick to claim when the ball came his way. Parks tied his career high for saves on the day, keeping the Big Green out 11 times. His performance was highlighted by a dazzling save in the 21st minute, when he tipped a dipping shot from Dartmouth junior forward Noah Paravicini over the crossbar.
After shifting into a more defensive formation as a result of Belloni-Urso’s sending off, Harvard looked as if it were going to keep Dartmouth out, and even looked like scoring on a few occasions. The Crimson spent most of the game with 10 men behind the ball, which frustrated the Big Green, as attack after attack was repelled by the Harvard defense.
Instead, it took a moment of brilliance from senior midfielder Matt Danilack in the dying moments of the game to salvage a win for the Big Green. With Harvard struggling to clear the ball out of its box, Danilack capitalized on the confusion, with his overhead kick finding the back of the Harvard net.
The Crimson, in contrast to its counterparts in green, started the game by trying to pass its way up the field, and attempted to counter Dartmouth’s direct style by patiently waiting to find its opening. While struggled to switch the point of attack before Belloni-Urso’s sending off, it found it almost impossible when it was forced to do it with one less player.
While Harvard struggled to find its rhythm on offence, it held together well on defense, making the last minute goal that much more heartbreaking.
“It was a super tough way to go out. Keeping the scoreline 0-0 for the whole game and giving up a goal with 30 seconds to go is not a great feeling,” said captain and defender Eric Gylling. “I think the rest of the game shows how committed the whole team was. Everyone was super supportive of one another afterwards, and that was great to see.”

Following its victory against Boston University earlier in the week, Harvard field hockey returned to Ivy league action on Saturday to face off against Dartmouth. In a tale of two halves, the Crimson overcame a first half lead by the Big Green (7-9, 2-4 Ivy) to win, 6-2.
At the start of the game, Harvard (12-4, 5-1) sought to intimidate its opponent with its attack, as the Crimson fired off three shots in the first five minutes of play. These attempts, however, were turned away by a series of saves from Dartmouth goalkeeper Hailey Valerio. Following Harvard’s offensive onslaught, Dartmouth responded. In the 10th minute, the Big Green got on the scoreboard as forward Gemma Bautista received a pass and fired her shot into the back of the net.
Following the goal, Harvard looked to get back into the game. The Crimson fired off six shots over the next ten minutes. Once again, however, Valerio was there to prevent a tying goal. Dartmouth only needed one shot to double its lead. In the 24th minute, Bautista popped up again, collecting a redirected shot and scoring her second goal of the day.
Facing a 2-0 deficit, Harvard had the option to wilt and accept the loss. However, as it has done for the majority of the season, the team showed its resiliency in the face of a challenge. In the 27th minute, senior midfielder Ellie Cookson saw her pass redirected by a Dartmouth defender. However, freshman forward Mimi Tarrant managed to collect the pass and beat Valerio with her shot to put the Crimson on the board.
Neither team managed to score for the remainder of the half, and the score remained 2-1 in favor of the Big Green. The team went into the half having missed several opportunities, and the scoreline could have easily been reversed in the Crimson’s favor.
“We weren’t playing at the caliber we had set,” senior goalkeeper Olivia Startup said. “We thought we were allowing Dartmouth to dictate the rhythm of the game more than we wanted. We were getting lots of opportunities - we had a lot of penalty corners in the first half - but we weren’t able to finish our chances.”
Harvard began the second half much in the same way as the first, with a series of shots on net. This time, however, those attempts proved more successful. In the 38th minute, sophomore midfielder Bente van Vlijmen collected a pass on the right from a penalty corner. Van Vlijmen then fired off a great shot to tie the game at 2-2.
The Crimson didn’t have to wait long for its next goal. In the 45th minute, freshman midfielder Tessel Huibregtsen extended the team’s lead to 3-2. On the play, Huibregtsen took off on a 20 yard run downfield before finishing from close for the score. The goal gave Harvard its first lead of the contest.
“There was a lot of confidence going into the second half that we could turn this around,” Startup said. “We knew that we could make the second half our game.”
In the 55th minute, junior midfielder Victoria Boylett played a long pass to Tarrant, who was waiting at the top of the circle. Tarrant then turned, shot, and scored her second goal of the game to extend Harvard’s lead to 2 goals.
Just two minutes later, sophomore forward Maddie Earle collected a pass from Tarrant and saw her shot beat Valerio for the score. Despite now leading by 3 goals, Harvard continued its assault on net, firing off three shots in the next three minutes. This attack culminated in the team’s final goal of the contest, as Cookson played a pass to junior back Olivia Allin for the score. The assist was Cookson’s tenth of the year and adds to her record for career assists (which now sits at 34).
With Saturday’s result, the Crimson improves its record to 12-4, which ties the program record set last year for total wins in a season. As Harvard travels to Columbia next weekend for its final regular season game, it has a chance to take sole possession of the record.
“It’s always something on people’s minds,” co-captain Hannah Wellington said. “You’re always looking for new goals to set for the season. Again, we talk about taking every game as it comes because we want to be at the right mental state. That means focusing on ourselves and what we can do while not focusing on the big picture too much.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Young talent led the pack for the Harvard cross country team at this year’s Ivy League Heptagonal Championships. The event, held this past Friday at Van Cortlandt Park in New York City, saw two Crimson runners secure top-25 finishes.
On the men’s team, freshman Hugo Milner followed up his top performance at the Princeton Invitational with an 11th place overall finish out of 88 Ivy League runners. He completed the five mile course in 25:20.30.
On the women’s side, fellow freshman Abbe Goldstein competed in the women’s 6K race and secured 23rd place out of 90 runners with a time of 21:52.30. Goldstein’s finish was a squad best for the women.
Van Cortlandt Park’s course posed unique challenges for the Crimson.
“As a team, the biggest challenge was trying to get out in the front,” Milner said. “[The race] started on a big wide field and then suddenly it went straight into a path that was only about 2 meters wide. From the start, we were told to try to get to the front before we hit the path.”
Feeling the effects of being such a young team, both Harvard cross country teams placed eighth overall.
“We have a lot of freshman on the team compared to a lot of the other teams, which have juniors and seniors competing as well,” Milner said.
With 189 points, the Crimson men placed eighth overall in the men’s five mile, behind seventh-place Brown which finished with 164 points. Last year at the Heps Championships, the Harvard men’s team also finished in eighth.
Freshman Milner earned second time All-Ivy and finished first amongst all freshmen male runners at the meet. Milner started the race at the front, dropped back mid-race to about 20th place, and then made a comeback near the end to nab 11th place. Even despite his team-leading finish, the freshman still recognizes the room for improvement.
“I was satisfied with 11th, but I know I could have done slightly better than that,” Milner said. “The people in front of me were only marginally in front of me….The way I’ve been training, I feel like I could have beaten them.”
Other notable men’s performances came from junior Collin Price, who finished in 38th place with a time of 26:02.30, and from freshman Michael Alber, who claimed 48th position after crossing the line at 26:17.70.
“I think we were a bit unlucky on the day,” Milner said. “A few people got injured and a few underperformed a little bit.”
While the men’s team took eighth for the second year in a row, the story for the women was the opposite. Last year, with four runners finishing top 10 out of 92 total female runners, the Crimson women won the Ivy League Heptagonal Championship. This year, the team reversed course, struggling to make it to the front of the pack, and ultimately finishing eighth overall.
“We’ve had a lot of transitions that have complicated the sport,” captain Elianna Shwayder said. “Last year was pretty simple for our group. We went out and took care of business. We ran hard.”
For the first two kilometers, Shwayder and Goldstein were on track to finish in the top 10 of the pack. However, Shwayder lost a shoe and had to finish the race with only one spike. This, in addition to the difficult middle part of the race, pushed the members of the women’s team toward the back of the group.
“Everyone encountered different challenges throughout the race,” Shwayder said. “Overall, we really struggled to be competitive in the part of the race that really mattered—the middle three kilometers in the hills…. We’re all really intense competitors but we didn’t bring that out on the hills where we needed to dig deep.”
For the rest of the squad, junior Kathryn Gillespie finished 38th in 22:18.10, sophomore Gillian Meeks finished 53rd in 22:32.50, and in 78th place Shwayder finished the race with one shoe and a time of 23:08.50.
“Overall no one came away from the race happy,” Shwayder said. “It was a really tough day for everyone. We are much better athletes than how we competed as an overall group.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the second year in a row, the Harvard women’s rugby team battled Dartmouth in the Ivy League title match. For the second year in a row—and the second time this year—the Crimson ultimately fell to the Big Green, 22-8.
No. 2 Dartmouth (6-3, 3-0 Ivy), came into the match strong, rattling off a score in the first six minutes. These first five points came on an interception from Big Green senior Frankie Sands, though the following conversion was unsuccessful. Visitors to Brophy Field, No. 4 Harvard (3-2-1, 1-2) was immediately on the defensive.
“This week at practice we really focused on composure under a pressure defense,” sophomore Delia Hellander said. “[It] prepared us physically and mentally for this high intensity game.”
The Crimson’s defense has been its calling card so far this season. The team has two shutouts, and it held Ivy competitor and then-No. 10 ranked Brown to just eight points. However, Harvard allowed 22 on Saturday.
The attack struggled as well. Coming into the match, the Crimson had tallied an average of 63.6 points per game—its eight points marked the lowest offensive output all year.
Harvard did not immediately cave after Dartmouth’s opening score, and the Crimson responded by controlling the majority of the play into the latter portion of the first half. A second try by the Big Green appeared to break the Harvard defense, but it was ultimately not counted.
The scoreline stayed the same until the 24th minute when the Crimson received a penalty, allowing Dartmouth to open up a play on its own terms. Big Green sophomore Becca Jane Rosko proceeded to scored on a try off of the penalty, expanding the team’s lead to 10.
“We definitely brought the physicality and mental toughness to give Dartmouth a run for their money,” sophomore Tori Tong said. “I think we dominated in contact and scrums and staying connected with each other on defense and offense.”
Harvard junior Caitlin Weigel halted a Dartmouth run down the field only to have the Big Green tally a successful try on the opposite side. At 33 minutes into the half, Dartmouth had expanded its lead to 15, before a successful conversion upped the score to 17-0.
Momentum at its back, the Big Green’s Kat Ramage squeezed another score in before the half so that when the whistle sounded, it possessed a solid 22-0 margin.
However, a Dartmouth penalty merited a three-point kick after the whistle. Junior Jenny Kronish took the shot and converted, preventing the Crimson from heading into its locker room with a zero on the scoreboard.
“Our biggest fault in the first half was our poor alignment on defense near the wide channels,” Hellander said. “Once we fixed that, we dominated defensively which enabled us to maintain possession and play our game plan.”
The two teams returned to the second half invigorated and ready to battle for the Ivy League crown. Both Harvard and the Big Green both played aggressively throughout the second stanza, utilizing every minute of play.
For the first several minutes, each side was able to successfully prevent the other from scoring, though there were a few close calls.
The Crimson pushed for a try when junior Ginny Miller passed to Kronish at the line, but Kronish was unable to power across and tally the points. However, it would ultimately be Harvard that scored the only points in the second half. In the 80th minute, with no time remaining, the Crimson scored its only try of the match when freshman Erin Wright forced herself across the line to add five points, making the score 22-8.
With this loss, Harvard moves to 6-9 all-time against Dartmouth.
“I think we’re leaving this match and Ivy season with the knowledge that we have the skills and fortitude to play on a very high level against other challenging teams,” Tong said. “More than that we’re able to go into a match, play our game, come out of it and learn what we need to improve, work on that and bring all of that to our next game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite the rough patches that the Harvard women’s soccer team has gone through this season, Saturday’s game against Dartmouth was always about something bigger than the team’s place in the standings. With four seniors playing for the final time in their careers at Jordan Field, the Crimson looked to send them off with one last home win.
“A lot of players were gritting it out for our seniors,” Harvard coach Chris Hamblin said. “It just goes to show how much the players care about them and want to get a good result for them.”
Just as in last year’s Senior Day contest, the Crimson found itself in a tight overtime battle. Unlike last year, however, when then-senior Rachel Garcia stepped up for her class and scored the winning goal, it was a freshman ended up the difference maker on Saturday.
Forward Murphy Agnew, who entered the matchup as the team leader in assists, found the back of the net in the 103rd minute with a curled effort from outside the box. The well-struck ball swerved away from diving Big Green goalkeeper Mariel Gordon to seal the overtime win, the squad’s third such victory this season.
In overcoming Dartmouth (6-10-0, 0-6-0 Ivy) by a final score of 2-1, Harvard (8-8-0, 2-4-0) moved back to .500 for the season and now has a chance to secure its 11th straight winning record if it can top Columbia in the season’s final weekend. The Big Green, meanwhile, locked up a last-place finish in the conference irrespective of next week’s results.
Before Agnew’s game-winner, the contest swung back-and-forth with each team grabbing the momentum at different points. Dartmouth came out on the offensive early on, forcing three quick saves from Crimson junior goalie Danielle Etzel.
Etzel would continue to be vital to her team’s chances, as she collected a career-high 13 saves on 14 shots faced. Her previous career high for saves had been five, a number which she passed early in the second half.
Before the Big Green could capitalize on any of its chances however, Harvard struck first in the 20th minute. Junior midfielder Leah Mohammadi found Agnew on the counter, and Agnew swiveled past two backtracking defenders before slotting home past Gordon. It was the freshman’s first conference goal of her career, and first one this year since the middle of September.
“Murphy’s been a special player for us,” Hamblin said. “She’s tough [for defenders] to handle. The one thing she’s been missing is her final touch, and we told her to get closer to goal and the results would come, and that’s what she did today.”
Chances came at a premium for the rest of the first half, and the two teams entered intermission with the Crimson holding on to a one-goal advantage.
After the break, Dartmouth once again started on the front foot. This time, however, it was able to find the finishing touch as freshman defender Bonnie Shea nodded the ball in from a corner kick in the 59th minute. Harvard’s set piece defense was otherwise spotless, as it neutralized 12 other Big Green corners, but Shea’s goal was enough to tie the match at one apiece.
Dartmouth continued to surge forward to try to take the lead, and just like last week—when Princeton scored four times in the second half to blow open the game—the Crimson was at risk of letting the contest slip away.
“This week in training, we tried to focus on the things that we could improve in our game,” senior midfielder Dani Stollar said. “We switched a couple of things up, and stayed focused on what we could control out there.”
Unlike last week, the Harvard defense held out and kept the game tied. The Big Green ultimately recorded 15 shots in the second period alone, with nine of them on target. The Crimson meanwhile, only launched five shots. Dartmouth also had seven corners to Harvard’s none in the second 45 minutes.
When the two teams reached overtime, however, it was anyone’s game for the taking. After a slow first half of overtime, Agnew’s impressive effort sealed the result early in the second, sending the seniors off with one last home win.
“Getting our last win on our home field was the best we could have asked for,” senior defender Candy Janachowski said. “Everyone put themselves on the line today, and we really couldn’t be happier.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Emerging triumphant in last week’s home opener against Dartmouth, Harvard women’s hockey undertook its first road trip of the year this past weekend. The Crimson jumped right into conference play, with a Friday win over ECAC and Ivy opponent Princeton, and a Saturday loss against Quinnipiac, also in the ECAC.
Harvard (2-1, 2-1 ECAC) now has two weeks before its next set of games, and much to think about in that time. The 2-1 defeat to the Bobcats (5-4, 1-1) will come as a disappointment, but the 3-2 victory against the Tigers (1-1-2, 1-1) was classic Harvard hockey—good goaltending, strong power play, and a shoot-first mentality. Most of all, the Crimson will be pleased with the work of its freshman class, which scored all four goals and picked up several assists over the weekend.
“This weekend was definitely a test for us,” said junior forward and tri-captain Kate Hallett. “We have to be able to turn around on Saturday and get the job done again, regardless of the outcome on Friday. [But the freshmen] have brought a lot of energy to the team, and...we want to continue to watch them develop, and develop as an entire team.”
QUINNIPIAC 2, HARVARD 1
The Bobcats played host to the Crimson in its ECAC home opener on Saturday after losing, 1-0, at Dartmouth a day earlier. Despite the loss, Quinnipiac boasted high shot totals on Friday and, aided by Harvard’s lack of discipline, saw a similar result in this matchup.
The first period went by with no score, but gave some indication of what was to come. In those 20 minutes alone, the Bobcats outshot the Crimson by 13-3, and had two power plays. Early on in the second, Harvard found itself in the box twice over, with freshman forward Keely Moy and defender Kate Glover both penalized. That 5-on-3 proved too much for the Crimson’s penalty kill. Quinnipiac freshman forward Taylor House tipped in a shot from sophomore defenseman Kati Tabin to give the Bobcats the lead, 1-0.
“[Penalties are] something we struggled with a little bit last year as well,” Hallett said. “It comes down to playing disciplined defense, moving your feet, and playing smart—no retaliation.”
Harvard saw two power play opportunities at the end of the second period, but was unable to capitalize. Instead, the Bobcats scored again. Sophomore defenseman Kate MacKenzie found herself alone in front of the goal, and roofed the puck over Crimson sophomore goalie Beth Larcom’s shoulder.
Though Harvard was on the penalty kill twice again in the third, the team suddenly found the jump in its step. With just three minutes left in the game, Crimson freshman forward Becca Gilmore shot from between the circles and thwarted Quinnipiac sophomore goalie Abbie Ives’s shutout bid. The goal was Gilmore’s first collegiate tally, and brought Harvard within one. The Crimson pulled its goalie and sent a flurry of shots at the Bobcat net, but the effort was too little, too late.
“If we had played the first two periods like we did the third, we might’ve come out with that win,” Larcom said. “It’s tough to come home with a loss after that, but we learned a lot, and we fought to the very end.”
HARVARD 3, PRINCETON 2
On Friday, the  Tigers hosted the Crimson in their Ivy League opener, still looking for their first win of the season. With Princeton’s perfect 10-for-10 record on the penalty kill and Harvard’s high-flying 33% power play, this meeting looked to be a contest of the immovable object and the unstoppable force. The Crimson’s real strength wound up being its dynamic freshman class, which scored all three goals and powered Harvard to victory.
Early on, a Crimson goal seemed like an inevitability, as Harvard peppered Tigers sophomore goaltender Steph Neatby with shots. However, six minutes in, Crimson tri-captain Lexie Laing was called for interference, and the Tigers had its first real chance. Princeton wasted no time; with center Laing in the box, Tiger junior Karlie Lund won an offensive-zone faceoff to sophomore Carly Bullock. Bullock, last season’s ECAC Rookie of the Year, beat Larcom with a hard shot from the left circle.
The Crimson didn’t let the scoreboard stop its offensive push, however. A few minutes after Bullock’s tally, Hallett led forwards senior Nikki Friesen and freshman Lunasa Sano in crashing the net. In the ensuing scrum, Neatby lost track of the puck and Sano was able to cash in the first goal of her college career, tying the game at 1-1.
Up-and-down play continued until Moy forced a turnover right in front of the Tigers net. Moy held onto the puck while Neatby came out to challenge her, then slipped it past her short-side, giving the Crimson its first lead of the night. Each team then had another power play chance to start the second, but the goalies proved to be the best penalty killers on both sides of the ice. Larcom had a strong showing overall, stopping 23 of 25 shots.
“When you’re on the ice and [Larcom] is in net, the entire team feels a really big sense of confidence in the d-zone,” Hallett said. “She stood on her head, and she typically tends to do that.”
Princeton then had an offensive surge, however, and freshman forward Annie MacDonald fed Bullock in the slot from behind Harvard’s net. The Tigers had tied the game again, 2-2. Princeton kept the Crimson on its heels for the rest of the second period, but made the mistake of taking an interference penalty just a few minutes into the third.
Harvard’s careful passing ended in sophomore forward Kat Hughes ripping a shot towards the net. While Neatby made the save there, the rebound landed on the stick of freshman forward Brooke Jovanovich. Jovanovich had a wide-open net, and that’s all she wrote.
“A lot of people contributed, and younger players played well,” Larcom said. “We got the job done, so that put us in a good spot.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a dramatic weekend on the road, the Harvard women’s volleyball team came up short in multiple five-set contests, dropping both of its games to Columbia and Cornell.
After a heartbreaking back-and-forth affair with the Lions (8-10, 3-6 Ivy League) on Friday night, the Crimson’s comeback attempt against the Big Red (10-9, 6-4) after going down two sets came up just short.
“We put up a really good fight this weekend, and I’m really proud of the team and the way we fought,” sophomore setter Erin McCarthy said.
CORNELL 3, HARVARD 2
In its second five-set matchup of the weekend, Harvard’s late comeback against Cornell ultimately was not enough, evening the season series at 1-1.
The Big Red jumped to an early lead, grabbing the first four points of the contest. The Crimson (11-8, 6-4) would not lead the entire set as Cornell rode this energy, taking the set 25-16.
Although Harvard struck first in the second set, the Big Red would take an early 4-3 lead and never looked back. This lead would last the entire set, with the Crimson unable to keep up and dropping the set 25-19.
Harvard, however, showed it had fight left in the must-win third set. The battle was close the entire set, seeing multiple lead changes as neither team was able to pull away. With a 23-21 lead, the Crimson would end the set on two straight kills from captain Christina Cornelius to force a fourth set.
“We didn’t start really playing until the third game, but when we did, we did a great job,” Cornelius said. “We had a lot of grit, and we were fighting for our season there.”
Cornell attempted to end the game without playing a fifth set, taking an early 6-2 lead, but Harvard’s important four-point run prevented a runaway that would have ended the night early. The teams went back and forth throughout the set until a kill from senior outside hitter Paige Kebe won the set, 25-22, and took the contest to a decisive fifth set.
“We came out slow, but in the third game we dug in and put up a really good fight to turn it around,” sophomore setter Erin McCarthy said. “It was one of the best comebacks we’ve had so far.”
Despite blowing its two set lead, the Big Red would not allow the Crimson to complete its comeback. Harvard never lead in the final set, as Cornell held off Harvard’s resurgence by taking the set, 15-11, handing the Crimson its second five-set loss of a climactic weekend.
COLUMBIA 3, HARVARD 2
Harvard struck first in the neck-and-neck battle, taking the first set 25-18 due to an impressive run late in the set. Leading 19-17, the Crimson took control of the set, scoring six of the next seven points, capped off by a block from Cornelius and junior middle blocker Jocelyn Meyer.
Columbia fought back in the second set. The margin between the two squads did not exceed four points in the close contest, and ultimately the Lions were able to come out on top. Columbia capitalized on its opportunities, landing four service aces in the second set alone.
The third set proved even closer, with Harvard and the Lions fighting neck-and-neck the entire set. After the two teams traded points to make the score 21-20 the Crimson, Harvard would not allow Columbia to put up any more points in the set, going on a four-point run to take a 2-1 lead over the Lions.
The fourth set would prove the most competitive. The Crimson would take an early lead and was up by as many as eight points. However, Columbia did not roll over, slowly chipping away to even the score at 21-21 thanks to multiple runs. With the game knotted up late at 23-23, the Lions stole the last two points and took the close set 25-23, sending the game to a winner-take-all fifth set.
“It was a roller coaster, and the whole time we couldn’t really get a steady rhythm,” Cornelius said.
Harvard would not lead again in the matchup, as Columbia kept its momentum from its fourth set comeback, jumping to an early 5-0 lead. The Lions retained control of the set, eventually taking the set 15-11 and thus the matchup 3-2.
Despite seeing double digit kills from five players, including a team-leading 14 kills from sophomore outside hitter Grace Roberts Burbank, the Crimson was unable to overcome Columbia’s late momentum that ultimately gave the Lions the game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Both looking to rebound from losses in week six, Harvard and Dartmouth faced off Saturday in a must-win matchup for each team.
The intensity showed. The Big Green (5-2, 2-2 Ivy) came out hot, scoring two quick touchdowns In the second half, though, the visitors faltered while the Crimson only gained steam. Erasing a 14-point Dartmouth lead, Harvard (4-3, 2-2 Ivy) took control and maintained that  lead as time expired to win its 14th in a row against the Hanover, N.H., program.
FOURTH-QUARTER HEROES
Dartmouth is a fourth-quarter team. Tied for second in the Ivy League, the group has played exactly one game this season that has been determined by more than four points.
Against Holy Cross, the Big Green scored the go-ahead points in overtime. Against Penn, Dartmouth scored on fourth-and-goal as time expired. Against Yale, the team tallied 14 points in the fourth quarter, including a touchdown pass with 34 seconds left, to win by one. And against Sacred Heart, the cardiac competitors scored in the fourth quarter to take the final lead of the game.
On Saturday, facing a 25-14 deficit with 7:21 to go, the Big Green was down. But the team was far from out.
After all, prior to this game, Dartmouth had outscored opponents 45-9 in the final period.
Against Harvard, the script seemed likely to repeat. The Big Green started by driving the length of the field, earning a touchdown, and cutting the Crimson margin to three. Harvard got the ball back with 4:18 left and tried to bleed the remaining time. It was unsuccessful.
“We had control of that game,” junior linebacker Jack Traynor said. “We had a clear opportunity to take control and win that game.”
With 1:36 remaining, Dartmouth held the ball on its own 20. Now, it seemed, was the time for the prophesied Big Green comeback. That’s almost what happened.
Quarterback Jack Heneghan rattled off five straight passes, three of which were complete for five, 15, and 10 yards, respectively. That push moved the ball near midfield.
However, with about 1:15 left, Heneghan slung a low pass near the right hash. The ball took an unlucky bounce off Harvard senior cornerback Raishaun McGhee and floated just enough for senior safety Tanner Lee to stretch out and slip his arms beneath the ball. That interception halted the threatening Dartmouth campaign.
“It seems like every week we're in a battle [in] the last couple minutes,” Traynor said. “Up until that last interception, we thought we were right in it.”
FRIENDLY FOES
Dartmouth and Harvard football have a storied history. So do their coaches.
Born eight days apart, the figureheads of these two Ancient Eight dynasties have been friends for nearly a half-century, going back to their days of Little League baseball. The pair had a memorable encounter during an early game. As he rounded third, future Crimson coach Tim Murphy charged down the line and plowed into future Big Green coach Buddy Teevens manning the plate. The collision adeptly foreshadowed the many years that the two would meet across an Ancient Eight football field.
Before they competed in football, the pair played for the same varsity squad. Teevens took snaps at quarterback while Murphy protected him on the offensive line and took spells at defensive end and linebacker.
After attending the same middle school, the two became good friends—so good that after work during the summer, Murphy would hitchhike his way to the Teevens household and join Buddy and his five brothers in their gym.
By the time they attended Silver Lake Regional High School in Kingston, Mass., the two were inseparable. Both starters for the varsity team, Teevens went on to lead Dartmouth to an Ancient Eight title in 1978, and Murphy headed to Springfield College to play linebacker.
The pair reunited in 1985 when Teevens became Maine’s head coach and brought Murphy on as the offensive coordinator. When Teevens eventually left for his alma mater, Murphy took the reins in his first head coaching position with the Black Bears.
Now, 30 years later, the two face off every season in the rivalry between their two respective institutions. So far, Murphy has been perfect. When coaching against his high school teammate, Murphy is 13-0.
“They’ve probably done the best coaching job of turning a team around this year of anyone in our league,” said Murphy of the Big Green coaching staff. “They’re literally two plays away from being 7-0. They’ve done a remarkable coaching job.”
A SERIES OF FORTUNATE EVENTS
The Big Green went up 14-0 early in the first half, and then the Crimson scored 25 straight points. Harvard’s about-face can be attributed almost entirely to a single moment.
With over a minute left in the half, the Crimson was forced to punt the ball. Up 14-0, Dartmouth had the opportunity to extend its lead to three possessions heading into the locker room. In other words, the Big Green controlled the game.
The punt soared high and towards returner Danny McManus, who called for the fair catch. Senior halfback Jack Stansell was the first man in crimson to meet him on the coverage. Racing behind Stansell, a Dartmouth defender ran into the halfback, who collided with McManus. Flags came flying.
The contact with Stansell was not enough to knock over McManus—just enough to distract him as the ball bounced off his chest and toward the approaching Harvard coverage.
The referees conferred among one another, presumably about the distance of the penalty on Stansell, only to pick up the flags and declare Crimson ball on the the Big Green 38-yard line.
That decision did not sit well with the visitors from Hanover.
“[Without the penalty,] you're going up 14-zip and feeling pretty good,” Teevens said. “Maybe we'll come away with three points or something. [Instead,] they go down and score. It could have been a great situation for us, and it turned into a wonderful situation for them and made it a much closer ballgame.”
From there, Harvard exploded. The offense took advantage of the fumble, as freshman quarterback Jake Smith tossed an eight-yard touchdown pass to senior tight end Ryan Antonellis. Now down only eight, the Crimson went into the half with a more manageable deficit.
“There were a couple plays at the end of the first half that were maybe questionable, but whatever—you've got to live with that [and] keep fighting,” Traynor said. “It's impossible to put into words the frustration that we have right now.”
Coming out of the locker room, it was evident something had changed. Harvard received the ball and drove to the end zone on 12 plays for 76 yards. The possession ended when sophomore running back Lavance Northington took a snap from the four. Essentially everyone believed that the Crimson would run on the ensuing play, as the team had with Northington all year. Instead, after gathering the snap, Northington took two steps left and and fired a bullet to Antonellis. The score went down as Northington’s first college completion.
“[Northington] was a hell of a high school quarterback,” Murphy said. “He’s just a great athlete, a great decision-maker, and a great leader. You have to find multiple ways to use him. You have to defend the spin-motion plays on the perimeter. He’s just one of those kids that’s a unique fit.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard sailing team concluded an eventful weekend with three top-10 finishes in the 77th Professor Schell Trophy, Nickerson Trophy, and Victorian Urn Trophy Conference Championship regattas. The first was hosted by MIT, the second by Tufts, and the third by Harvard.
The Schell Trophy, featuring 18 teams and 18 races, commemorates Erwin Schell, who was at the forefront of organizing and fundraising dinghy sailing at MIT in the 1930s. On the first day of the regatta on Saturday, the weather maintained a comfortable 70 degrees. The A Division raced in Fireflies while the B Division raced in turbo FJs.
The Engineers jumped to a 33 point lead after the first day of races and finished 64 points ahead of the rest of the field. Roger Williams and Yale rounded up the top three. The Crimson placed eighth with 290 points, finishing six points behind Brown and eight points ahead of Boston College. Harvard barely missed the top seven, which granted teams the Atlantic Coast qualifying spots for New England.
“We knew we had this really regatta coming up,” junior Nicholas Karnovsky said, “so we were working really hard to make sure our boat handling was as good as it needed to be and that we were super focused and super ready come Saturday morning.”
Senior Nick Sertl and junior Christine Gosioco raced for the Crimson A division and accumulated 130 points, including six top-five finishes, while Harvard’s B team of senior Kevin Coakley, junior Nicholas Karnovsky, sophomore Jessica Williams, and freshman Eli Burnes, competed in the B Division and added 160 points of their own.
“So, unfortunately I had a slow start to the day, and we had a couple of bad races to start off, but then we were able to turn it around a little bit, and by the end of the weekend on Sunday, we really had things clicking and were doing much better,” Karnovsky said. “We actually missed qualifying for the championships by six points at of a total of 290. So, in that sense it was really frustrating because we had in all this hard work and it didn’t pay off, but in the long run, it catalyzes us to work harder and make sure it doesn’t happen again.”
The Nickerson Trophy, held on the Mystic River in Medford, MA, featured winds from the South/Southwest. The field also included 18 teams who each participated in 10 races in Larks. Harvard finished fourth with 128 points, trailing to Stanford, Jacksonville University, and Boston University. Freshmen Henry Burnes and Emily Wang scored 48 points, including seven top-five finishes, in the A Division, good for second. The B division team finished in eighth and added 77 points.
Burnes raced earlier this season in regatta on the Mystic and even practiced on these waters in middle school. However, this race featured new conditions and a fierce field of competition that included some of the best freshmen sailors in the nation.
“I don’t think my sailing there before prepared me because every day is unique and the wind is always slightly different, and it’s also definitely a very variable venue,” Burnes said.
The major axis of the Mystic is situated North-South, and the wind was blowing South to North. Since the breeze roughly followed the path of the water, it acted as a dam and was more consistent than if it passed over the trees and hills on either side of the water.
“It was easier to adjust to then normal,” Burnes added. “It was definitely shifting a lot, but it was pretty easy to get adjusted to, to be able to predict the shifts that happened, and to sail the course fast and strategically.”
The Victorian Urn Trophy, featuring 16 women’s teams in 10 races, saw the Crimson finish in 10th place with 260 points, meaning it missed the top eight to qualify for the Women’s Atlantic Coast Championship. Yale, Boston College, and U.S. Coast Guard Academy comprised the top three.
Seniors Taylor Ladd and Kirstin Anderson scored 119 points in the A division, including seven top-five placements and two first place finishes. In the B division, juniors Taylor Gavula and Alejandra Resendiz, sophomore Lucy Wilmot, and freshman Tess Avery competed for Harvard, added on a score of 141.
The team has one more set of regattas in the winter and will spend the spring preparing for qualifying races.
“So, basically we’re going to spend the next six to eight weeks in the spring making sure we’re performing in tip-top shape,” Karnovsky said, “Come qualifying events, we’ll be ready so that we can go to Nationals.”

You read that headline right: Lamont is discontinuing bag checks.
For those of you who maybe don’t carry eight to ten books with you at a time, this may not seem like a big deal, but for humanities concentrators, this is arguably the biggest change to rock campus since Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted to end Harvard Time.
It’s finally possible to just drop into Lamcaf for a coffee and not have to empty your entire bag, spilling your coffee on the guy behind you in the process.
According to the library, the bag check system was logistically inconvenient, causing a “bottleneck at the guard’s desk.” You can see the full announcement here: 
But it makes you wonder: how likely is it that someone would even steal from the library? Especially one that doesn’t even charge late fees. If you were jonesing that hard for the Oxford Companion to Shakespeare, fifth edition, it’s so much easier to just CHECK OUT THE BOOK and never return it. Obviously, don’t do that. The last thing we need is more thieves among us.
No longer will we have to schedule a buffer period of 10 minutes on our way out of Lamont in anticipation of a winding line at the bag-check counter. No longer will we dread just popping into the library, because it’ll take longer to dump everything out of our backpack than to just print the readings.
No more bag check? All we have to say is:”it’s about time.”
