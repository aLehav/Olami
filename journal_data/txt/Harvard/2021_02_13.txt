Compared to the stories of Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King Jr. or Malcolm X, the life and assassination of Fred Hampton, chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party, is not as well known by the general American public. Shaka King’s upcoming film “Judas and the Black Messiah,” debuting Feb. 12, hopes to change that.
The film stars Daniel Kaluuya (“Get Out”) as Chairman Fred and LaKeith Stanfield (“Sorry to Bother You”) as William O’Neal, the FBI informant who betrays the chairman. The film follows O’Neal as he grows closer to the Party and to Hampton, before ultimately betraying him — directly leading to Chairman Fred’s assassination by the FBI.
On Feb. 6, Kaluuya and Stanfield were joined by costars Dominique Fishback (“Project Power”), Darrell Britt-Gibson (“Just Mercy”), Dominique Thorne (“If Beale Street Could Talk”), and Algee Smith (“The Hate U Give”) for a virtual roundtable discussion to talk about their forthcoming film. While the conversation with the actors touched on all aspects of the filmmaking process — from researching the real-life characters they portrayed to filming long scenes on set — the discussion continuously returned to the socio-political implications of “Judas and the Black Messiah” and the history of race and power relations in the United States. Each actor offered their own insight on the importance of creating a film that tells the story of a lesser-known Black radical. They shared stories on how they first came to know about Chairman Fred and the historical Black Panther Party, as well as their feelings on the contemporary Black Lives Matter movement.
“We don’t know about Chairman Fred Hampton because, if we did, America would have to own up to the things that it has done,” said Fishback. “I think the importance, in general, is that we’ve always had heroes and we don't get to know that. There’s always some kind of white saviors in these stories. And by learning about Chairman Fred — and the fact that a lot of us have never heard of him — [we ask ourselves] who else have we never heard of?”
“This film articulates and shows strategies and blueprints of what a lot of people are feeling right now,” Kaluuya said, in answer to the same question. “And [then they go] ‘Oh, the stuff I’m feeling now isn’t new, isn’t foreign. I don’t feel weird for feeling like this.’ [They think,] ‘Oh, what did these people do about it?’” Kaluuya further highlighted the historical dimensions of the Panthers that audiences might learn through the film. “And then, a lot of people that have felt the urge to, a call to, move as a result of the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor are going to take in this film and be like: ‘Oh man, they did this, they did what? They started a medical clinic? Wow. They fed kids? Wow. They educated kids? They took care of their world,’” he said. “I think we have the tendency to try to change the world, but when you change your world, the world sorts itself out. So it’s that thing where, I think, it could be a call for a lot of people to do that.”
Reflecting on her character Judy Harmon, a member of the Black Panther Party, and the roles of women in leadership positions, Dominique Thorne spoke of how she thinks society’s views on the topic have changed since the ‘60s and ‘70s.
“I think that the primary change that I see is an understanding of the fact that women will be placed in positions of power, period. This is not negotiable. This is fact. This is a right. This is something that is necessary. And it is something that needs to be far more commonplace than it is,” she said.
Beyond speaking to the film’s political implications, the actors all spoke highly of the film’s creator Shaka King.
“I owe a lot to Shaka King, our writer-director, because he really allowed me to put my stamp on the character,” Fishback said when asked about the intricacies of playing her role. “He allowed me to tap into my own womanhood, to express these stories and I think that’s what allowed me to get into the world and portray all of those emotions.”
Stanfield agreed.
“Shaka allowed us to exercise a lot of creative freedom, which is dope. A lot of people don’t give you the freedom to explore the character, they want to stay rigid to what’s in the text,” he said while describing what it was like to play a character as serious as William O’Neal.
While the six actors had different stories about growing up with varying degrees of awareness of Fred Hampton and the Black Panthers prior to filming, lessons to share on race and the Black Lives Matter Movement, and perspectives on the film, one thing they all agreed on was that “Judas and the Black Messiah” is required viewing of audiences everywhere.
When asked what audiences needed to see the film most of all, Britt-Gibson, who plays the co-founder of the Illinois Black Panthers Bobby Rush, responded quickly and succinctly: “Everyone.”
“I know that sounds like such a blanket response to an incredible question but I do believe that everyone needs to see it because it’s everyone’s story,” he said. “It’s our story, but it’s everyone’s story because Chairman Fred always spoke about power in numbers and power wherever there’s people — and unity. He was about unifying everyone. So this is a story that everyone needs to see.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last semester I lived in Mather House, which was big and lonely and kind of like a ghost town. I would walk up the six flights of stairs up to my dorm and startle in surprise at the tapping of other footsteps above me — idiosyncratic evidence that there were actually other people living there too. When I glanced down into the courtyard from my common room windows, there would only be a smattering of students scattered about below, like stray dust mites someone above had forgotten to brush away. Every time I ended up in the courtyard, I would look skywards toward the concrete block tower with only a handful of windows lit up, feeling like the protagonist of a post-apocalyptic movie surveying the remnants of human civilization.
So I left Mather, and often. Given how Harvard Yard (specifically the steps of Widener Library) became the social center for freshmen living on campus, and how most of the friends I made happened to live somewhere reasonably close to the Yard, three or four times every week (sometimes more, if I had forgotten my laptop), I geared up to make the eight-minute trek from my dorm to the Yard.
Harvard students love to complain about distance. The Quad is so far away it might as well be its own postal code. I only liked Thayer because it was so close to the Science Center. This class is so far away, I don’t even want to go. It’s all about location, location, location here, and closer is always better.
There are a lot of reasons I could’ve or should’ve hated the walk from Mather House to the Yard. It was thoroughly inconvenient and inefficient. As soon as I learned something was happening, I was already 10 minutes late. The winter night temperatures chilled my sensitive Californian constitution. There was this bit of street in the last stretch that was really confusing for pedestrians, and every time I crossed I prayed a car didn’t end me there.
But despite all these very fair reasons I shouldn’t have, I loved the walk. I bundled up in a hat and gloves, listened to music, and just gave myself time to think as muscle memory carried me to the place I had been so many times before. Granted, my thoughts often took the form of “why am I doing this.” But that was also my most important thought.
I think it’s a testament to how much you love other people that you would walk (eight minutes during a cold winter night) to visit them.
I think of the line in “Hey There Delilah” by the Plain White T’s, the anthem of long-distance relationships, that goes, “A thousand miles seems pretty far / But they’ve got planes and trains and cars / I’d walk to you if I had no other way.”
I think of the chorus of “I’m Gonna Be (500 Miles)” by The Proclaimers: “But I would walk five hundred miles / And I would walk five hundred more / Just to be the man who walked a thousand miles / To fall down at your door.”
I think of the people I would walk to, no matter the distance, just to be together with them in the flesh, physically tangible, breathing the same air. How, at the end of the world, if all the trains and buses and planes in the world shut down and there was no easy way to reach anyone, I would run to see some people for the last time. To hold their hands and look at them in the eyes as we say goodbye.
I also think of how easy it is to let these minuscule things of eight-minute walks and bad weather split us apart from the people we so cherish. In New York City, or so I’ve been told, couples break up because their places are on different lines on the subway and they can’t spare the extra 10 minutes of transit time. At Harvard, people would definitely visit their quadded friends, if only the Quad wasn’t so far away. We fall out of each other’s lives with the littlest bit of effort, and sometimes none at all.
For all my Mather House to the Yard walks last semester, I am equally guilty of letting relationships fizzle out due to perceived distance. I should practice what I preach. If I love you, I would walk to you, wherever you are, however long it takes. There are only so many hours in a day, but I love sharing space with you more than I fear the lost time. So let me put on my gloves, and I’ll get going.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s graduate student union filed a notice of intent to bargain with the University Friday, officially launching negotiations for its second contract representing more than 4,000 student employees.
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers sent out a bargaining priorities survey and announced the planned filing of the notice of intent in an email to members Thursday. The next day, HGSU-UAW filed with the University and submitted its first information request for data that it will use in bargaining.
“The biggest takeaway from this is that when you file for notice you’ve started a conversation,” HGSU-UAW President Brandon J. Mancilla said.
The union elected its Bargaining Committee for the second contract last December. Nine graduate students from across the University, along with Mancilla, will represent HGSU-UAW in negotiations. Just one member of the group, Statistics Ph.D. candidate Cory W. McCartan, is a holdover from the Bargaining Committee for the union’s first contract.
Now, the union will move into an information gathering phase, sending multiple information requests to the University and gathering data from its membership to determine negotiation priorities, according to HGSU-UAW Bargaining Committee member Ash E. Tomaszewski. From there, the union will start drafting proposals in advance of negotiation sessions with Harvard.
“One of the main ways that we build these priorities is from our bargaining survey,” Tomaszewski said. “We really encourage anyone who’s at the University to fill out that bargaining survey, because the more input that we have the more able we are to actually represent the student workers and students in general.”
HGSU-UAW plans to vote on bargaining priorities in early March, according to Mancilla.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain confirmed in an emailed statement that Harvard plans to engage in contract discussions with the union later this year.
“The University continues to work with HGSU-UAW on the implementation of the contract that went into effect last July, and we look forward to engaging in the upcoming discussions around its renewal this year,” Swain wrote.
The first contract HGSU-UAW ratified last summer expires June 30. Mancilla said the union will continue to focus on wages, healthcare benefits, and discrimination and harassment procedures — issues that were prominent during the union’s first contract negotiations and problems he said student workers continue to face.
The union conducted the longest graduate student strike in recent history in December 2019 after more than a year of negotiations. When it reached the one-year agreement with Harvard in June, HGSU-UAW vowed to lobby the University for stronger protections against discrimination and harassment in its next contract.
“All of this takes pressure,” Mancilla said. “It takes pressure from organizing. We’ve learned that this year from our multiple engagements with the administration.”
Tomaszewski said the pandemic has raised the importance of job security and health care. Mancilla cited mental health as one example. In addition to their plan to push for more provisions surrounding mental health in the new contract, HGSU-UAW representatives plan to bring up those concerns in a meeting next week with Harvard administrators.
In the meantime, HGSU-UAW is also focusing on increasing membership. Thursday’s union-wide email urged members to encourage friends and colleagues to join the union.
“Having a year under our belt has definitely taught us a lot,” Mancilla said. “We’re going to get the contract we fight for, so it’s absolutely crucial for our student workers to join the union officially in order for us to have the greatest bargaining power come the first negotiating session.”
