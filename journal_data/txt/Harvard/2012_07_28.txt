After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dr. Paul J. Barreira has been named the new director of Harvard University Health Services and Henry K. Oliver Professor of Hygiene, according to an announcement from Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 on Thursday.
Barreira, who previously served as the director of Behavioral Health and Academic Counseling at HUHS, will be replacing retiring director Dr. David S. Rosenthal ’59, who had served in the position since his appointment in 1989.
Barreira has been affiliated with the University since 2000 and with HUHS since 2005. The Boston College alum is currently a member of eight committees and advisory boards affiliated with the University and its teaching hospitals.
During his tenure as director of Behavioral Health and Academic Counseling, Barreira made addressing mental health and alcohol use a priority. He also taught a freshman seminar titled “What is college and what is it for?”
Barreira said sees the active engagement of students as key to the well-being of the community.
“I hope to continue the work of Dr. Rosenthal to provide the most competent care to our community and to strengthen our educational efforts by expanding student participation in HUHS activities,” he wrote in an email to The Crimson.
In 2008, Barreira oversaw the founding of the Student Mental Health Liaisons Program, modeled in part on the existingDrug and Alcohol Peer Advisors and the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Alliance, to better address mental health-specific issues. Combating the stigmatization of depression and mental health problems within the Harvard community has been, and will continue to be, a priority for Barreira.
“I am proud of the team that leads the Behavioral Health and Academic Counseling offices and the strong role of students in our peer-to-peer education programs,” Barreira said.
“I am honored to have been appointed to this position. I love working at HUHS and I am delighted to have the opportunity to continue to work with everyone in the Harvard community,” he said.
According to Barreira, HUHS oversees the medical and specialty care of over 20,000 students and 10,000 employees through the Harvard University Student Health Program and the Harvard University Group Health Plan.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first day of competition on the Eton Dorney rowing complex is over, and so far it’s been a mixed bag of results for Harvard alumni out on the water.
The best result of the day came for Brodie Buckland ’06 of Australia in the men’s pair. Along with teammate James Marburg, Buckland came second in his heat, progressing the pair to the semifinals on Wednesday.
Buckland raced in the second heat of the day, but the first heat had the most excitement. Eric Murray and Hamish Bond of New Zealand posted a world’s best time of 6:08.50, more than 15 seconds faster than Buckland and Marburg. If the Kiwis can keep this up it will be tough going for the rest of the field.
In the eight, Malcolm Howard ’05 and Canada had a solid dent put in their hopes to defend their Olympic Gold Medal, when they came last in their heat, being forced to duke it out with six other boats in the repechage on Monday. Thanks to the way the eight is configured, only the top finisher of each heat advances directly to the final. Canada dropped off significantly in the final 500 meters of the race, once the chances of catching leader Germany looked slim.
We can only speculate, but perhaps the veterans of the Canada boat made a conscious effort to conserve energy for Monday’s repechage—we’ll have to wait and see.
Finally, in the men’s lightweight four, Will Newell ’11 of Team USA finished last overall, forced into Sunday’s repechage against Italy, the Czech Republic and Poland. In the days leading up to the games Newell noted the tight competitiveness of this year’s lightweight four field, stating that “If we can make it into the A final I’m optimistic we can make something happen.” Tomorrow may be Newell and his Oklahoma City based boat’s last chance to do it.
At 5:15 this afternoon (10:15 London Time) you can watch Temi Fagbenle ’15 in action as the hosts, Great Britain, take on Australia on the opening night of the women’s basketball group stage.
It, as all events, will be available online at nbcolympics.com and on the NBC family of networks.
Stay tuned as we continue to bring you comprehensive coverage of Harvard's 2012 Olympians.
