On New Year’s Day 2019, Chicago rapper Noname dropped the single “Song 31,” ft. Phoelix. It was her first release since her well-received debut album “Room 25” in September. Just a few months later and with virtually no promotion, Noname released “Song 32.” On “Song 32,” Noname switches topic breathlessly, weaving obscure references throughout her lines so quickly that if you don’t listen close enough you just might miss them. The single is yet another testament to Noname’s unique ability to combine clever lyrics, complex subjects, and jazz-inspired instrumentals to transport the listener into a poetic and immersive soundscape.
Produced by fellow Chicago-native Phoelix, “Song 32” opens with whistling backed by jazzy, percussion-saturated instrumentals. The whistling stops abruptly, and Noname enters the song with a fast-paced verse. She swiftly shifts from commenting on staggering bills to inordinate wealth, dropping metaphors and allusion so quickly that it’s hard to catch the full effect on the first listen. This fast delivery is to wonderful stylistic effect: Noname doles out searing critiques of American greed and interventionism, and she doesn’t care if the subject of her critique is fast enough to keep up.
She switches subjects effortlessly, delivering her takes on wealth and popular culture (“I’m Cardi’s engagement ring”), religion vis-à-vis Eve (“Apple wasn’t the apple, the truest sin was the pussy”), and American politics (“I’m Obama pushing the button, in Libya, Pakistan”). She closes the verse with the line “I’m America at its best.” She covers a wide range of topics in just a few lines, and it’s initially unclear what the message is. The invocation of America makes the subject explicit. She repeats the line again and, for the first time in the verse, leaves room for digestion.
The whimsical chorus features the refrain “Yippee-ki, yippee-ki-yay,” a one-liner from the 1988 action film “Die Hard” that is a satirical reference to cowboys. Noname is the most recent proponent of the “Yee-Haw Agenda,” a musical reclamation of the tropes and imagery of the “American Cowboy.” The line should feel out of place, but it somehow feels at home amidst the Caribbean accent that she dons on top of the drum beat.
Noname boasts about how the success that she has found originated in poetry (“Started getting money from writing the haiku”), but this bravado is betrayed in the second verse. Returning to the flow of the first verse, she shifts to the more personal, discussing her loneliness and commenting on her competing desires to remain humble while enjoying wealth (“Part of me buried in the earth, part of me chasing more money”).
As an independent artist who has decried the obscene wealth and fame that comes with celebrity, Noname must navigate the realities of the spotlight that accompany critical acclaim. She masters these contradictions. In her music, she layers lyrics saturated in serious content over lighthearted instrumentation. In her professional choices, she is a conscious independent artist who uses her platform to draw attention to important issues in the industry. From the gray area within these binaries of art and obligation, she creates something beautiful.

2019 has been a banner year, capitalizing on the nostalgia of the kids of the early 2000s: The Jonas Brothers released a new single, there are rumors of a “Drake & Josh” reboot, and Miley Cyrus has once again donned the blonde wig. But Cole Sprouse saw the merit in taking advantage of Millenials’ yearning for the good old days, rebranding himself from the little boy running around The Tipton Hotel to the brooding high school “weirdo.”
Although Cole Sprouse and his twin, Dylan Sprouse, have been acting since they were eight months old, it wasn’t until their 2005 debut in “The Suite Life of Zack and Cody” that they made a name for themselves. Not only did the three-season show get nominated for three Emmys, it also was the most successful show premiere on Disney Channel at the time. The show — about twins who run wild in The Tipton Hotel, where they live — was a staple of many children’s T.V. rituals in the mid-2000s. Dylan and Cole returned as Zack and Cody again and again in crossovers of other popular Disney shows like “That’s So Raven” and their spinoff show “The Suite Life on Deck.”
But after “The Suite Life Movie” in 2011, the Sprouse twins left Zack and Cody behind and began to differentiate between themselves. While they both attended New York University, Cole pursued archeology while Dylan studied video game design. From 2012 until 2016, neither brother appeared in much of anything as Cole worked on excavations while Dylan opened All Wise Meadery, only reminding the world of their presence with the occasional funny tweet. However, 2017 brought “Riverdale,” a huge turning point in Cole’s career.
Much like the “unpopular opinions” that get so many retweets on Twitter precisely due to the opinion’s popularity, Jughead Jones — and by extension, Cole Sprouse himself — is the weirdo everyone loves because he is so relatable. Jughead is a character full of contradictions: He’s a softy hipster boy who wants to write novels, whose father is the leader of the notorious gang, the Southside Serpents, and yet his best friend is Archie Andrews, star of the football team and Mr. Popular himself. Jughead keeps company in all the cliques — the artsy students, the tough kids, the misunderstood, and also the popular crowd. In other words, he’s hyper-relatable.
Most famous is his “I’m a Weirdo” speech, in which he says, "In case you haven’t noticed, I'm weird. I’m a weirdo. I don't fit in. And I don't want to fit in. Have you ever seen me without this stupid hat on? That's weird." This sparked a flurry of memes making fun of what Sprouse himself calls one of Jughead’s “cringeboy moments.” But more importantly, this moment marks Cole Sprouse’s successful rebranding from Cody, the mischievous little boy that made Millennial children laugh, to the moody and melodramatic teenager that his fans, now 10 years older, crave.
So, Sprouse’s latest role in “Five Feet Apart” — a YA sick-lit novel adapted into a movie — continues his new trajectory as the not-so-average teen heartthrob. In this film, Sprouse plays Will Newman, a teenaged cystic fibrosis patient who meets another CF patient Stella Grant in the hospital. In a movie reminiscent of the 2014 tearjerker “The Fault in Our Stars,” Sprouse’s touching performance is sure to pull at the audience’s heartstrings.
While Dylan stars in indie films and lives an obscurer life, Cole’s rebranding has put him back in the spotlight. Even before bringing back the 2000s was the hot new thing, Cole Sprouse has reemerged and taken roles that are relatable to any young adult who doesn’t see themself as average (which is, apparently, pretty much everyone). In perfect Jughead Jones fashion, Cole Sprouse capitalized on the 2000s nostalgia before it was cool.

“The East Side,” the inaugural Harvard Asian Student Arts Project (ASAP) production at Farkas Hall, tells a tale of authenticity, identity, acceptance, and above all, love of all kinds.
This original coming-of-age musical comedy follows 17-year-old Ryan (Jason Yoo ’21) and his struggle with his developing identity as an American-born Chinese student. Ryan and his immigrant mother, Ms. Chen (Bo Young Choi ’17), run a family restaurant in New York City’s Chinatown called “Chen’s Dumpling House.” Dulled by life at the restaurant, yet full of youthful ideals, Ryan struggles to balance the typical high-schooler’s life: spending time with his friends, studying for the SATs, and pursuing his romantic interests, while also tending to his one true hobby, painting.
Ryan’s struggle to choose between his “Eastern” and “Western” identities in Chinatown, the East Side of New York City, is where Julia H. Riew ’21, musical co-writer and ASAP co-president, derived the musical’s titular inspiration.
Riew said that the lack of Pan-Asian representation in the musical theatre industry compelled her to amass a group of Asian artists on campus for this feature production. “There are more musicals starring a man named Charlie than there are musicals with Asian characters that I can think of, especially if you only consider musicals that are with Asian characters that are not offensive or stereotyped in a certain way,” Riew said. “And then I guess I was thinking maybe I should write a story that maybe is a little bit closer to home for me.”
Yoo shares the same sentiments. “I guess we're trying to prove that there is a space for Asian-Americans as well to do theater and do the arts. We’re not just confined to the stereotypes,” he said. “It’s an exciting, fun, non-typical way to represent something that’s usually not represented in theatre.”
Yoo hopes the audience will be pushed to grapple with deeper questions of identity and authenticity. “I think the overall message of the musical is don't lose sight of who you are just because conformity is an easier path. You should always stick to your heart to make who you are as a person,” he said.
“The East Side” is set to showcase an array of “scenic spectacles” and “cool practicals,” as described by Lights Designer Kat C. Zhou ’17. “You'll see these bulbs that fly in and we have these sort of fake neon signs. We're pretty excited about that.”
Co-producer Chloe I. Yu ’21, a Crimson multimedia editor, added, “The banners have been really fun to work on. Some of them are painted, and we use lights to illuminate them for Chinatown and Koreatown.”
In terms of the musical repertoire, Yu looks forward to the SAT song, where every single letter that the students bubble in, “A, B, C, and D,” corresponds to actual musical notes. “So when they sing D they're actually singing the note D as well as the letter D,” Yu explains.
Director Keehup A. Yong ’19 said of the music, “I think the music is the most catchy that I've ever heard in a musical. It's crazy. Once you've heard it, it doesn't leave.”
Yong spoke about the spontaneity and constant collaboration of the artistic process. This rang true in developing the dance pieces, most of which are hip hop-based, with one particular section featuring popping and locking. “Some of our cast members were tap dancers, so working with a choreographer and myself, we decided to add a tap number in,” Yong said.
When finally asked to summarize this entire project in a single catchphrase, Yong stumbled and took a long pause. “Dumplings, love...and gentrification,” he said. “That’s what this story is all about. It’s about food. It’s about different types of love. And it’s about how a setting changes the people within the space, but also how a space changes based on societal pressures.”
The East Side will be at Farkas Hall from April 11 to April 14. Tickets are free.
Correction: April 12, 2019
A previous version of this article misidentified Bo Young Choi as Bo Y. Choi.

Cyndi Lauper’s voice pierces the darkness with a familiar refrain: “Oh mother dear, we’re not the fortunate ones / And girls, they wanna have fun.” The lights rise on Sara Porkalob in a black retro windbreaker, hair pulled high into a bun, as Lauper’s soaring soprano fades into a haunting whisper. Porkalob’s eyes ignite with an impish flicker. There’s no turning back. She’s in charge.
In “Dragon Mama,” a new one-woman play, Porkalob shares her mother Maria Porkalob Jr.’s story with refreshing veracity and wit, breathing vigorous life into an impressive roster of diverse characters. Deftly fusing comedy and tragedy, Porkalob intensely depicts a young woman’s odyssey to recover her lost adolescence amidst the sonic panorama of the late ’80s.
“Dragon Mama,” which premiered on March 28, supplements the narrative of “Dragon Lady,” Porkalob’s solo cabaret about her grandmother Maria Sr. Both shows run at the Oberon through April 7. The pared-back staging and popular music soundtrack of “Dragon Mama” flourish in the intimate nightclub venue.
Indeed, Maria Jr. consistently listens to hip-hop, techno, and pop to retreat from a confusing, burdensome reality. As the eldest of five siblings living in a trailer park with their single mother, she grows up too quickly and soon becomes a mother herself. In the delivery room, as the doctor places her newborn in her arms, Maria Jr.’s face twists in bewilderment. She says, “I have a daughter? Okay.” Staring into her child’s eyes, she smiles and says, “I’m gonna name you ‘Sara Lee.’ Like the cheesecake.”
Later, as her baby wails and her family literally pounds at the door, her sole recourse is to slip on her headphones, crank up Technotronic’s “Pump Up the Jam” on her Walkman, and fist-pump the world away. Porkalob, glinting with sweat, less impersonates Maria Jr. so much as reaches through the void to touch her.
Eyes closed, stomping her Converse sneakers to the beat, Maria Jr. could be confused for a John Hughes heroine if her brows weren’t so furrowed with pain. In a part of town even John Bender from “The Breakfast Club” would find too rough, Porkalob validates her mother’s experience and diversifies the legacy of the “Brat Pack.” By co-opting their music, aesthetics, and humor, she convincingly affirms Maria Jr.’s participation in their canon.
With no friends and no future, Maria Jr. flees the suburban desolation of Bremerton, Wash., to work on a fishing boat in Anchorage, Alaska. There, where time and space stand still, she mourns the tenderness and human connection absent from her teenage years. Initially shameful and shy, Maria Jr. gradually opens up to others and ventures into an underground realm of queer fantasy.
Subtle gestures – a glance, a smile, an outreached hand – contain multitudes, leading to compassionate lovers and true friends. When guilt-ridden memories of her daughter left behind in Washington interrupt Maria Jr.’s newfound Arcadian bliss, Porkalob sheds earnest tears. For Maria Jr., the tears signify regret. For Porkalob, they insist forgiveness.
Although “Dragon Mama” is entrenched in themes of poverty, Asianness, and queerness, it excels by neither preaching about nor sensationalizing them. Following a heated conversation with her siblings about their absent father, a young Maria Jr. addresses a missionary knocking at the door. She shakes her head at his mention of Jesus and politely says, “He abandoned us too, thanks so much!”
Whereas someone less confident might over-educate or over-explain, Porkalob trusts that her family is easy to love. Baring her secrets and her soul, she challenges others to broaden their conception of normality.
While the show’s stripped-down nature allows Porkalob’s exceptional talent to shine, its minimalism introduces challenges. Without sets, props, or other actors, Porkalob is tethered to a straightforward linear narrative and very thorough exposition. Sometimes it becomes difficult to distinguish between characters, which number up to five in a single conversation, without clearer shifts in location or vocal characterization.
Running at two hours with intermission, the one-woman format grows stale. Due to the sheer amount of material, Porkalob occasionally speaks too fast, speeding through poignant moments that deserve the time to really sink in.
Still, some conflicts noticeably go unresolved. Perhaps Porkalob’s father is Chester, Maria’s high school boyfriend, but perhaps not. Maria Jr.’s romantic feelings toward her flippant playmate Arlene similarly lack closure.
However, the frustration emerging from these unanswered questions is ultimately a gift. Yes, it’s hard not to sympathize with Maria Jr.’s numerous hardships, but deeper down, her story’s ambiguities encourage a more personal, visceral reaction than arises from passive observation.
Society traditionally lauds education and income as harbingers of emotional stability. That being said, the Porkalobs, through their substantial trials, undoubtedly captivate as they engage with the cathartic, the raw, and the real. They remind us how good it feels to feel.

UPDATED: August 12, 2020, 11:33 p.m.
Northwest Labs was transformed into a runway for the 2019 Identities fashion show on March 31. After many weeks of work, the models were prepared, the production was ready, and jackets, gowns, jump suits, lingerie, wedding dresses, and more from student designers and famous luxury designers alike waited backstage.
The show opened with a short interview with Jack Gaffaney, Vice President of DIOR Men’s North America.
“The specific reason I’m in this business — and what I hope for all of you — is that you have a passion for people and you have a passion for what the confidence and excitement of dressing well… can provide other people or provide yourself,” Gaffaney said.
His advice to students aspiring to enter the fashion industry: work in retail. “Being in a store, working with people, working with clients, working with the product in a hands-on way, is really a foundation of what will kind of give you an understanding of the industry, understanding of the client, and understanding of yourself and your passion,” Gaffaney said.
Next, model Coco Rocha took the stage to receive the annual Identities Leadership in the Arts Award. In her speech, Rocha spoke of the difficulties young models face.
“Up until recently, New York, the capital of fashion in America, had very little protection for those underage models,” she explained. “For example, you could work an underage model — she didn’t have to have any protection, she didn’t have to be paid or fed — you could work her 24/7, it didn’t matter. There were no laws.”
Rocha has lobbied congresspeople to change the laws and spoken out about predatory individuals in positions of power within the industry, but she said that the efforts of her and other models have been met with resistance.
“I realized… being a whistleblower would not be enough to enact the kind of change that was necessary,” she said. “I realized I was going to have to change my own corner of the industry.”
Rocha’s work to protect and educate young models led her to establish her own agency, Nomad Management, and, later, the Coco Rocha Model Camp.
“A few days ago, I got to bring a little sample of the Coco Rocha Model Camp here to Harvard,” she said, then added, “Does that make me like, a professor of Harvard?”
“Do I get a plaque for that?” she added. “Like, a staff sweatshirt or something?”
Before the show, Rocha came to Harvard to lead a coaching session for the Identities models, teaching them how to pose and walk the runway. The evening offered the models a chance to put these skills to action.
“I loved the fact that they had different people represented,” audience member Toochi A. Uradu ’22 said after the show. “It felt like it really encompassed what ‘identities’ meant in terms of representation.”
Uradu said her main takeaway from watching the show was to make more daring fashion choices. “I love dressing up and stuff,” she said, “so [I] definitely would love some of these outfits if it were possible, and to just explore other fashion outside of my comfort zone.”
Identities model Hakeem O. I. Angulu ’20 said he thought the show delivered an important message. “I want the audience to understand how serious of an art form fashion is — and also modeling, how serious an art form modeling is — and to realize that even though it is serious, it is incredibly accessible,” he said.
Angulu has modeled previously for Identities and had some background in modeling prior to that, but he emphasized that many join Identities with no experience.
“Many people who modeled today had never modeled before, so this was a great first introduction for them into modeling, and also for the designers to get their pieces shown to a wide audience,” he said.
Grey O. Johnson ’22, for example, was completely new to modeling.
When asked how they got into the show, Johnson said, “It was a little bit on a whim.”
“I was thinking about it, toying around with the idea, and then I just found some heels and walked over to the audition,” they added. “Everyone seemed really cool so I was like, okay, I’m actually going to do it.”
When asked their main takeaway from modeling in the show, Johnson’s response was immediate.
“That I’m a bad bitch,” they said. “On the record.”

Nineteen minutes might be enough time to decide whether a movie is going to be worth your time, but it may not be enough time to develop true emotional attachments and connections with characters. Based on a screenplay by Clarissa Jacobson, J.M. Logan’s short film, “Lunch Ladies” simplifies his characters and dramatizes their emotions, in what seems to be an effort to prevent viewers from being tempted to stop watching after two minutes. Although the stereotypical characters are easy to understand and follow, their simplicity contrasts with the twisted story and over-the-top drama. This odd film will certainly keep one’s eyes on the screen, but leave one wondering, “What just happened?”
“Lunch Ladies” is a dark horror-comedy about two women, Seretta (Donna Pieroni) and LouAnne (Mary Manofsky), who are stuck making food for bratty and ungrateful kids at a high school. Seretta and LouAnne learn that they have won a mini burger cooking competition and have the chance to meet their ultimate inspiration: Johnny Depp. Having nicknamed him “Deppers,” Seretta and LouAnne have to keep their awful jobs in order to pay for the plane tickets to go see their idol. If the plot isn’t already weird enough, one of the lunch ladies kills a blond cheerleader after the girl makes snarky comments about their Deppers. The two heroines make pies out of her dead body and serve it to the high schoolers. The newfound popularity of their pies allows them to purchase the plane tickets and redeems them in the eyes of their boss, who had threatened to fire them unless they improved their food.
Peripheral but entertaining characters include a rude cheerleader who takes selfies and smokes a cigarette in the bathroom, a cranky old janitor, a zany lunch lady, and an annoying boss. What more would you expect in high school? That being said, the extremely easy to read and follow characters throughout the film’s erratic plot prevent boredom. The combination of stereotypical characters and general absurdity might easily remind viewers of Disney Channel original movies, but this time with a morbid twist. The dramatic “Home Alone”-esque soundtrack complements the macabre but darkly humorous plot.
Logan, an award-winning filmmaker, has been involved in all aspects of filmmaking: visual effects, sound, makeup, and more. Although this movie may seem too absurd to enjoy, Logan has masterfully used his knowledge of film to create a piece of art that is impossible to look away from. Logan specializes in incredibly gory scenes. His attention to details that make horror thrilling almost redeems the weak plot and makes for an exciting viewing experience. The moment when Seretta and LouAnne grind up the cheerleader’s body in a meat grinder is especially disturbing as well as tantalizing in a twisted way.
Logan is able to condense all the emotions, reactions, and plot into a very quick 19 minutes. This movie could have been extended into a full two hours with a plot that made more sense and more complex character development. Logan too severely compresses the emotion of a full-length feature into an overdramatized, stereotypical, and overacted comedy. Of course, Seretta and LouAnne’s dramatic hyperventilating, obviously fake crying, and orgasmic reaction to the letter informing them of their win were probably purposefully overdone in order to convey the maximum amount of emotion in 19 minutes. However, Logan pursues so many plot digressions at the same time that it is impossible to pay attention to anything else but the overblown drama. The film’s worst flaws are its thoroughly distracting storylines and over-acted moments, but ultimately make it an irresistible watch.

At this year’s Boston Design Week, sculptor Janet S. Echelman ’87 elucidated the evolution of her colorful, massive public art pieces, from her experience working with paint to fishing nets. Echelman’s presentation, titled “Radical Design: Illuminating Cities through Public Art,” took place at the Boston Design Center on April 4. Sponsors Design Lighting Forum (DLF) and The Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IES), whose websites state that their missions are to educate the community about lighting design, collaborated to host the event.
Boston Design Week is a 12-day festival dedicated to the celebration of diverse categories of design. This year, multiple events ran every day from March 27 to April 7. The festival included programs ranging from sustainable design initiatives, to behind-the-scenes looks at exhibitions in the greater Boston area, to discussions of the synergy between design and the human experience.
Echelman began her presentation with a look into her artistic past. Before she started sculpting building-sized nets, Echelman graduated Harvard setting out to be a painter. Her work started gaining recognition, and in 1997, she moved to India on a Fulbright lectureship to exhibit her paintings. Amidst travel frenzy, her painting supplies never arrived. She had to find a new medium.
Echelman was walking along the beach in the fishing town she was based in when suddenly the fishing nets she had seen cast so many times before caught her interest. Intrigued by their free-flowing qualities, Echelman began her long journey in creating with nets.
Because Echelman was entering the uncharted territory of netting as an artistic medium, she has become one of the first to engineer this material. Her determination and drive for creating works that represent her vision have resulted in collaborations with aeronautical engineers, software designers, and even the director of Google’s Creative Lab.
In her talk, Echelman also addressed her work’s sheer size. “The scale is so large that I can never see the actual, physical work until we install it. In the factory, we’re making 10, 50, 100 feet at a time, but never can we stretch out 750 feet,” she said. “There’s this nervousness until we unfurl it and pull it into place, and then a moment of, ‘Ah! It’s there!’ I wish it got easier, but I still feel it every single project.”
During the presentation, Janet noted that when challenges present themselves, she goes into “research mode.” As such, scientific data or historical landscapes tend to inspire her pieces. At the same time, she emphasized that despite having concrete concepts behind her work, she hopes that her pieces can stand alone without any context so that anyone can enjoy them.
“My work is experiential, so you are the expert of your experience. No one can tell you how you should feel or think about the work. You are an integral part of it,” she said. “Any human being can understand this work in their own way. That’s exciting to me.”
Since Janet designs many of her creations for outdoor, public displays, part of her mission in creating art roots itself in strengthening the connections between cities and their populations. She said, “My form is not about work in a studio — it’s about an interaction with the city and with each person within it.”
This philosophy comes to life literally with several of her pieces, such as in Skies Painted with Unnumbered Sparks in Vancouver, or 1.8 in London. The colorful lights projected upon her nets take on a new, interactive ability. People have the opportunity to pick and choose what colors they want to see on their smartphones and watch the work morph in real time. “I believe that the public complete this art,” she said.
Todd Lee ’74, a friend of Echelman’s through Harvard’s Loeb Fellowships, was in attendance for the event. “I was astonished at her energy, bravery, and willingness to think about lighting in new ways, and about sculpture in new ways, and about the environment and how people react to what they see and feel,” he said of Echelman.
“All kinds of people are enjoying it and getting down to something rich inside themselves,” Lee added. “People come out and go to it. They are drawn to them, day and night.”
Sara J. Schonour, president of DLF, and Susan J. Arnold, president of IES, further discussed how Echelman has illuminated the importance and potential of lighting. Schonour said, “You don’t think about [lighting] unless someone calls your attention to it. I think someone like Janet calls your attention to things that you otherwise might not realize.”
Arnold agreed – Echelman’s work causes people to look up. “Everybody now is looking down at their phones,” she said. “Just have a moment! Count to five, take a breath, sit back, and put your phone down. Just enjoy the moment and let the magic happen naturally.”

The music video for Ben Platt’s song “Bad Habits” begins with an empty room and a few vintage photographs. Platt — a Tony winner and newly-minted Broadway hero — shuffles into the room and hunches over the piano, his shoulders slowly creeping up. He leans into the keys. “You always said that I’d come back to you again,” he starts, with an air of almost uncomfortable familiarity. In a few moments, the persona of the larger-than-life Broadway star melts into something decidedly different. He is no longer tens (if you’re lucky) of rows of theater seats away. On his debut album “Sing To Me Instead,” Platt is right next to you, sitting at his living room piano with a visceral kind of honesty.
Platt is an unusual kind of Broadway star. Known for playing the titular teenager Evan in the musical “Dear Evan Hansen,” he projects vulnerability and comes across as a little more down-to-earth than many of his artificially illuminated peers. As a character defined by insecurity, Platt’s Evan never seemed quite comfortable.
The “discomfort” that so many “Dear Evan Hansen” fans saw and related to in Platt’s on-stage character is just as present on his album. But unlike other Broadway stars who have unsuccessfully tried to launch mainstream pop careers, Platt’s music is rooted in his personal fears, hopes, and insecurities, not just his powerhouse voice. This intimacy, combined with the lyrical specificity of the songs, turns “Sing To Me Instead” from a vocal showcase into a compelling narrative.
The songs ache with tension and heartbreak, painstakingly retold in break-up ballads like “Bad Habit” and “Better.” Meanwhile, “Ease My Mind” and “Share Your Address” show a lighter side of love — still strained and complicated, but made meaningful and necessary against the backdrop of individual darkness. The album as a whole is a unique piece of art. It’s not quite dramatic indie, easy coffeehouse, or pop ballad, but somewhere in between. Whether augmenting his searing high notes with a full choir on “Temporary Love,” or stripping back for a ghostly falsetto on “Grow As We Go,” Platt commits to off-Broadway realness. That raw, even strained, sense of vocal and lyrical intimacy ground his more melodramatic tendencies and cement his status as a serious pop artist.
Platt describes the songs as deeply personal — which necessitated, for him, the album’s role as an unofficial kind of coming-out announcement. As he told People Magazine, “If I was going to write about people I loved, I wasn’t going to pretend they weren’t men just because I hadn’t talked about that before.” The album is Platt’s first time addressing his identity as a gay man publicly, weaving it naturally into his narratives of love and loss.
But “Sing To Me Instead” is, first and foremost, about Platt holistically. The album is not just, as he put it to USA Today, a “coming-out album.” It’s about the holistic ups and downs of love, with Platt’s sexuality as a fundamental part of his identity, but not his entire story.
On “Sing To Me Instead,” Ben Platt succeeds in balancing the talent and theatricality that made him famous with the vulnerability that helps him tell a story. His debut album may or may not end up topping pop charts, but it nevertheless feels indisputably comfortable — in all of its artist’s discomfort — in a music world behind the scenes of the big stage.

This review contains spoilers for the third season of "Santa Clarita Diet.”
Unlike other zombie shows, “Santa Clarita Diet” never takes itself too seriously — a feat made obvious throughout the recently aired third season of the show. Starring Drew Barrymore as the realtor turned zombie and Timothy Olyphant as the co-realtor turned husband-of-zombie, the third season of this Netflix original series features undertones of race, politics, religion, and romance through jokes so awful, viewers cannot help but laugh.
Season Three begins with a whirlwind overview of the first two seasons in which viewers are thrust back into the hectic lives of main characters Sheila (Barrymore) and Joel Hammond (Olyphant) and their daughter Abby (Liv Hewson). The new season introduces a new set of antagonists, a zombie hunting group/cult called “the Knights of Serbia” as the Hammonds return to the home they fearfully vacated at the end of Season Two. This means the return of Eric Bemis (Skyler Gisondo), their socially awkward but extremely loveable neighbor and Abby’s best friend. Much like its first two seasons, this new season is inexplicably weird, yet enjoyable. Through its corny one liners, profanity riddled insults, awkward teenage social interactions namely Abby and Eric’s “will they, won’t they” relationship, and gory depictions of cannibalism, Season Three works both as a zombie show and a politically charged social commentary.
Season Three focuses on a number of distinct and easy-to-follow subplots that all intertwine at one point or another. One of these subplots follows the aftermath of Abby and Eric blowing up a fracking site together in environmental protest. Another focuses on Joel trying to join “the Knights of Serbia” in order to protect Sheila. Simultaneously, an unrelated subplot centers on Sheila’s own existentialism and inner turmoil as she contemplates whether her newly immortal life has any meaning. All the while, Sheila and Joel work hard to prevent a rogue mental hospital patient from spreading the zombie virus, stop the murder of a fellow realtor, avoid a devout Christian police officer who thinks Sheila is a messenger of God, and build up their new real estate business with the help of a living decapitated head.
It is through these (many) subplots that “Santa Clarita Diet” successfully manages to hold viewers for an easily bingeable, 10-episode third season. Barrymore and Olyphant’s on-screen relationship is so ridiculously unusual, yet built out of a deep, undying love that it almost makes the viewer wish that they were one half of this zombie-human realtor couple living in Southern California. On the other hand, while their relationship is so idealistic, in episodes such as “Zombody,” Sheila and Joel are forced to tackle the specific issues of a mixed-status zombie-human relationship. The arguments between the pair revolving around Joel’s decision to not become a zombie are reflective of couples who are unsure of their future and in which one partner may not understand the other. This relatability ultimately helps ground this otherwise fantastical show.
While Joel and Sheila deal with their marital issues, the on-screen friendship fostered by Abby and Eric remains an awkward yet painfully accurate depiction of high school friends developing feelings for each other. As the two friends face the consequences of their illegal actions from the previous season, they also deal with their unacknowledged love for each other. Things only complicate further when Abby makes a new friend and drifts apart from Eric. All the while, they are also burdened with protecting Sheila’s secret, fending off Eric’s jealous zombie ex-lover, and applying to college.
In the final episode of the season,“The Cult of Sheila,” events of the previous nine episodes are all satisfactorily resolved. However, despite the seemingly happy ending of the third season, in true “Santa Clarita Diet” fashion, the last episode concludes with an unexpectedly disturbing but oddly comedic cliffhanger, leaving viewers impatiently anticipating a still-unconfirmed fourth season.
The relatable relationships, intersecting subplots, implicit social commentary, and inappropriate humor are what make the latest season of “Santa Clarita Diet” so mindlessly entertaining. Shows that don’t take themselves too seriously while also providing viewers with some sort of substance are exactly what television needs and this underrated Netflix original fills this void. A cross between horror and comedy, “Santa Clarita Diet” not only upholds both these genres but also does them justice through its raunchy, scary, funny, and outright ridiculous third season.

Ariana Grande and Victoria Monét’s new single “MONOPOLY” is the kind of song you can play over and over again and never get sick of. This infectiousness is the strength of Grande’s sparkling and swaggering pop-rap anthem — the latest iteration of the formula that produced smash hits “7 rings” and “thank u, next.”
“MONOPOLY” is a piece of polished pop machinery that’s easy on the ears. Unlike many mainstream rap songs, its dominant sounds are not thumping bass or gaudy samples; instead, the track rests on a soft bed of compressed drums, wispy organs, and an occasional playful glockenspiel. This sparse and unsurprising beat gives “MONOPOLY” a subtle scent of the prepackaged cheerfulness concocted in a boardroom. Despite this, its music video gives the track an air of authentic celebration in which Grande and Monét joke around in front of a vintage camcorder and make surprisingly un-forced references to online culture.
For the most part, the track’s themes are just as fun as they are benign. Grande and Monét cover ground well-trodden by generations of pop stars. They brag about their careers (“I've been on a roll, where you been?”) and their money (“Then we hit the bank, making them investments for the win”), then attack their haters (“Bad vibes, get off of me”). Like almost everything else about the track, these themes are predictable, but effective. Expect nothing more than entertainment and energy from “MONOPOLY,” and you won’t be disappointed.
At the beginning of the chorus there is one short line that makes it impossible to consider this track just an ordinary pop commodity. Grande says “I like women and men” — a declaration that seems to contextualize her confusing relationship with queerness.
Recently, many have accused Grande of queer-baiting and some have construed her admission on “MONOPOLY” as another offence. There is plenty of merit to these claims. Grande’s music video for “break up with your girlfriend, i’m bored,” in which the singer flirts with a man before kissing his girlfriend, gave off serious and uncomfortable Katy Perry “I Kissed a Girl” vibes. And Grande’s choice to headline Manchester Pride as a cis and (apparently) straight artist provoked understandable backlash.
Still, at some point, otherwise justifiable scrutiny of queer signaling by a commercial musician becomes dangerous. The backlash against “Monopoly” nears that point. In the aftermath of the single, much online criticism of Grande has, deliberately or not, recycled misconceptions too often used to discredit bisexual people. One tweet cited by PinkNews compared Grande to the trope of straight women “kissing for fun” — a belittling stereotype many bi women must overcome. Another referenced the common misunderstanding that because Grande hasn’t dated another woman, she can’t truly be bi.
If Grande’s insinuations of her sexuality turn out to be insincere, there will be plenty of reason to be shocked and hurt. But for now, let’s try to accept Grande’s self-definition, lest our well-intentioned skepticism fall into the tired tropes of bi erasure. And let’s not forget to enjoy the infectious and uplifting sounds of “MONOPOLY” while we’re at it.

As part of the 2019 Boston Design Week, design magazine Metropolis delved into their latest issue’s theme, “Color and Light,” at Poppin’s Boston showroom on April 2. Poppin, a contemporary office supply company, hosted the event titled “The Power of Color.” Surrounded by colorful cabinets and tall lounge chairs, Editorial Director Samuel F. Medina broke down the use of color and light within each of the magazine’s featured articles, explaining how innovative application can yield unique architectural or artistic results.
Boston Design Week is an annual 12-day festival that promotes the diverse categories of design in events throughout the greater Boston area, from behind-the-scenes looks at exhibitions to learning about sustainable design, to open dialogues with creators in a variety of industries. This year marks the sixth rendition of the festival, which took place between March 27 and April 7.
The magazine’s latest issue explores how the manipulation of light and color can affect humans’ perception of a space or object. Medina began his presentation by discussing the magazine feature “Science Says Light Brighter!” by Audrey Gray, which discusses the work of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Lighting Research Center (LRC). According to the LRC, our exposure to certain lights at different times can alter how our bodies feel. Given that many people spend the majority of their time indoors, the article urges designers to carefully consider how they use light within their work, whether it be in a building or in an app.
Following this introduction, Medina highlighted other articles that feature artists who have used color and light as crucial mediums in their work. One of those artists is sculptor Janet S. Echelman ’87, another creator partaking in Boston Design Week whose monumental public art pieces utilize colored lights.
“Light in architecture tends to be a kind of mystified category,” Medina said. "You see museum architects really talking about light in a sculptural, poetic way, whereas architects who do more interiors or workplaces talk about it more almost in terms of metrics.”
Both Metropolis and Poppin have said that color is central to their companies’ aesthetics. Lexie D. Altman, an account coordinator with Poppin, commented on the company’s mission involving color: “With Poppin, we really want to make the office fun — our motto is ‘work happy.’ We want the office place to be a happy environment for people where they want to come and work,” she said. “Color has a lot to do with that, as it brightens [a space] up. Color is really important to our brand, and I think it always will be.”
Photographer Virginia E. Hanusik attended “The Power of Color” as a representative from Metropolis.
“We were really thrilled to partner with Poppin,” Hanusik said. “They’re one of our main sponsors and champions of our magazine, so being able to participate in Boston Design Week and learn more about what’s happening in the community here has been really wonderful.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When my sister told me she wanted to become a pescatarian, I instantly thought of my mom, a lifetime meat eater, whom I knew would distress over her decision. And I wasn’t wrong. When she found out, she turned to everyone she knew for advice: my father, her friends, and the internet. She even consulted a pediatrician to reduce my sister’s risk of iron deficiency. Despite my mom’s initial anxiety, our family soon embraced my sister’s lifestyle change. Our dinner staples shifted from rice with spare ribs and Chinese sausage to soy-sauce noodles with vegetables.
Even with new changes in our diet, we never completely eliminated meat. While my sister staunchly adhered to her pescatarian diet, my mother and father continued to consume meat openly and encouraged me to do the same. Eager not to let any food go to waste, my grandmother unloaded leftover chicken scraps and bones into a pot to concoct homemade chicken stock, which my mom fed us every night until it became a ritual. Witnessing my family’s extreme reaction, or lack of a reaction, to dietary change, I knew that if I ever confronted my family about vegetarianism, I would face a similar passive pushback.
Did my sister’s experience resonate with other East Asian-American children convincing their parents to adopt vegetarian diets? Was my family’s Asianness equated with non-vegetarianism? Should I feel guilty for not becoming vegetarian?
Rather than acknowledging the stories of individual Asians and Asian Americans grappling with vegetarianism, the media circulates the myth of a monolithic Asian culture that shuns all vegetarians. In October 2017, People For the Ethical Treatment of Animals, more commonly known as PETA, released an article titled “14 Surefire Signs That You’re an Asian Vegan.” One meme in the article features a woman posing as an Asian cook saying, “There’s NO meat in it. Haha wait, there’s pork in it.” Another meme shows a woman shrugging and saying, “Oh, you’re vegan? That’s fine! We have fish!” These memes simplify the Asian food palette, which I believe stereotypes Asian families as ignorant about and resistant to vegetarianism when, in fact, there is a widely accepted history of vegetarian and vegan Asian diets.
Contrary to how PETA portrays Asian vegetarianism, millions of Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist Asians across the world follow a strict vegetarian diet. Hinduism and Jainism, two ancient Indian religions, constitute 80 percent of India’s population while East Asian Buddhism has propagated across China, Japan, Vietnam, and Korea since 250 BCE. Asian vegetarians and non-vegetarians savor Buddhist dishes, delicious mountains of vegetables, wheat noodles, tofu, and seitan, and elevate them as staples enjoyed with others during holiday and family gatherings.
But even after learning about the legacies of vegetarianism in Asian, people must realize that not all Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist Asians practice and preach vegetarian and vegan diets the same way. One branch of Buddhism, Mahayana, equates consuming animal products with creating suffering between sentient beings, while another branch, Theravada, believes that eating meat does not undermine their religious doctrine. While it may be tempting to link certain religions or cultures with specific diets, the hundreds of variations prove that a wide vegetarian spectrum exists and thrives around the world.
Equally important as learning about the history of vegetarianism, vegetarians and vegans should not shame non-vegetarians, who may choose their diet to connect with their culture and family. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) assigns foods, such as meat and fish, to cold, neutral, and hot energies. By consuming meat, Chinese medicine devotees believe they can restore imbalanced parts of their yin and yang. Whenever I return home, my grandmother never fails to remind me of her allegiance to TCM. Ayurveda, a system of Indian medicine, similarly flourishes in India, as ancient Ayurveda texts posit that meat can cure disease. Just as religion drives vegetarian culture in parts of Asia, eating meat and fish is also deeply rooted in Asian culture.
As a highly personal decision that involves the intersection of culture, religion, and family background, choosing to be a vegetarian does not make a person more or less Asian. At a time when people are considering whether to adopt vegetarianism themselves, the diverse histories and spectrum of East and South Asian vegetarianism and veganism certainly deserve recognition.
—Contributing writer Jess L. Eng’s column, "Takeaways From Chinese America," wrestles with the possibilities and boundaries of food culture from a third-generation Chinese American perspective.

An inevitable part of watching any Expressions show — for mere mortals, that is — is the slight feeling of awe. Just how, exactly, do any of the roughly 100 dancers do that? There’s the additional feeling that any of their hip-hop based pieces, with the entire cast assembled on stage, could intimidate someone into silence within seconds. And it’s true: They probably could. Yet this season, an undercurrent of vulnerability reverberated through the stories the dancing conveyed in each piece — especially the ones that were Harvard-related. Yes, sometimes the crisp movements seemed to look very similar from one piece to the next, but this vulnerability about students’ relationships and encounters on a campus that can sometimes feel empty even when friends pass each other from one class to the next, was new, welcoming, and riveting.
If doing a backflip across the stage or twerking were punishable by expulsion, the dancers prove it would still be worth it. They moved together in perfect synchronization. The more successful pieces like “B.B.B” blended other styles of dance, such as ballet, with the otherwise at-times frenetic splits and clean lines formed from expert control over hands and feet. Members of EXP, the selective sub-company of the larger company itself, performed “Dkyuso, Queen of this Wine” with twitchy limbs that were one highlight of the evening. The amazing braggadociousness of “God’s Gift” was another.
Interestingly, the best performance was not a piece choreographed ahead of time, but rather an intermission of sorts. This show’s emcees, Michael J. Phillips ’20 and Milton K. Dorceus ’20, came back to emcee for the second semester in a row, and, as is customary, invited three audience members to show off their own improvised choreography. Inevitably the quality of the dances vary with who is called onstage, but at least during the 5:00 p.m. show, it was difficult to name a winner. If the crowd was roaring during the first short performance, it was deafening during Leah A. Smart ’21’s impromptu drop to the floor — which sent Phillips himself running around the stage — and supportive beyond comprehension when a father-daughter duo gave everything they had to “Baby Shark.”
Most notable and striking were “Overheard at Harvard,” choreographed by Daniel Lu ’20, and “dUuDE,” choreographed by Noah B. Ramos ’21 and Peter “PJ” A. Jankowski ’21. “Overheard at Harvard” acted out excerpts of conversations that could have been easily overheard on Harvard’s campus or posted to the Facebook group of the same name and wove them between each song that formed the piece’s track listing. If the character who received an A- on the first Expos paper of the semester wasn’t relatable, another character’s ability to mock that person (you know who you are!) was. Ramos and Jankowski’s approach was more philosophical but not less engaging than that of “Overheard at Harvard.” Between worrying about exams, catching feelings for someone, or dealing with mental health issues, the piece tackled it all — and the differences in each part of their choreography showed it.
Though similar in aesthetic to performances from the past two years (dark costumes, intense gazes, toned everything), the Spring show took that aesthetic and recontextualized it amid Harvard’s emotional and memeable (read: the Expos paper) landscape. This year’s performers included students from Harvard Medical School and Cambridge Middle School, running the gamut in terms of age while presenting a consistently jaw-dropping display of talent. Of course, it takes a unique confluence of factors, like the four guests who surprised the audience with skills of their own, or the two returning emcees, to inspire such levels of awe. Even the intimidating alternation between fluid movements and sharply-angled joint movements were inspiring: Likely, more than one person walked out at the end thinking, “Maybe I should try that too.”

The party is well-lubricated, but the vibes are chill. It is clearly a Social Event and everyone has put pants on for the occasion, so maybe they would like to dance. But also, the faint smell of cultural superiority is clogging everyone’s lightly made-up pores, and Top 40 tunes will indubitably get you uninvited from all such parties in the future. Folks are perched against freshly painted wall murals and the arms of stained beige couches. They are ready to stand fully upright and shake their heads to a lurching, low-key beat. How will you activate their college avatars and become the crowned hero of the night? This playlist is the Rosetta Stone to unleashing the more feral instincts of the endearingly try-hard alternative crowd. Some might say they have excellent taste in music… Bonus points if the queue is compiled on Bandcamp, the Franzia of music platforms.
Listen to the playlist here.
“The Less I Know the Better” by Tame Impala 
This song lights a slow-burning fire in the souls of all those who once furtively made a small rip in their second-favorite pair of jeans. Despite the questionably normative auto-dubbed vocals, this song’s thumping bass line appeals across time and genre. A great first attempt at getting everyone off the couch.
“Lost” by Frank Ocean 
Time to up the ante on this beat. “Lost” is one of Frank’s more underrated gems, so when everyone vaguely recognizes it, they will feel so validated that their toes will begin to tap and they may even feel compelled to mouth along to the chorus. That is a gift you can deign to give them on this fine Saturday evening.
“oh baby” by LCD Soundsystem
You’ve got the people in your clutches now, so it’s the perfect time to unleash a nine-minute human computer loop while you are still a trustworthy figure in the room. They won’t figure out they’ve been played until it’s over.
“Paper Planes” by M.I.A. 
Despite any hostility you may sense in the space after the endlessness of LCD Soundsystem, go ahead and die on the hill of reasserting the centrality of quality lyrics and creative sampling to good music with this Grammy-winning cut from the recent archives. Extra points if you mention MIA’s socio-political impact as a female Sri Lankan rapper. Negative points if you mention that Diplo produced this one.
“Reptilia” by The Strokes 
It is very easy to make people forget that the Strokes are an aggressively mainstream band at this point. Their classic riffs and angsty vocals still hold up despite the many radio plays. Listen carefully for the inevitable comments about Julian Casablancas being better on his own.
“FACE” by BROCKHAMPTON
BROCKHAMPTON is the least famous band everyone’s definitely heard of. Play this song quietly, so as to add to the continued mystique of why they are a boy band made of 100,000,000 people.
“I Follow Rivers” by Lykke Li 
A gorgeous, languid melody. An alluring Scandinavian songstress. This song is also a catchy, artisanal way to read the room given its presence on the “Blue is the Warmest Color” soundtrack — and perhaps musically preferable to Carly Rae Jepsen as a shibboleth.
“Summertime Sadness” by Lana Del Rey, Cedric Gervais
Much like the Strokes, it is startlingly easy to wave one’s hand and make even the most alternative of folks forget that this was a number one hit in 2013. An unassailable crowd-pleaser, keep this one in your back pocket in case a critical mass of people don’t recognize Lykke Li and become antsy.
“Sunflower” by Vampire Weekend ft. Steve Lacy
A recent addition to the canon, “Sunflower” has just the right amount of credible artistry combined with scientifically manufactured earwormage to fit smoothly on your playlist. If a projector is available, this is a prime opportunity to incorporate multimedia into your presentation and queue up the music video starring Jerry Seinfeld traipsing through the Upper West Side deli scene.
“Windows” by Donnie Trumpet & The Social Experiment 
Chance the Rapper transcends boundaries. Surprise your swaying listeners with a relatively deep cut from his trumpet-heavy side project. Make sure they aren’t listening when Chance sings, “Don’t you look up to me, don’t trust a word I say…”
“Space Song” by Beach House
It’s time to wind down with some shoegaze electronica. Can be substituted for the Cocteau Twins depending on how open the crowd is to alternative vibes of generations past. By this time, the party should be comfortably winding down and your status as aux vibe cultivator comfortably enshrined.

This playlist is not particularly suitable for a tasteful balayage completed at the hands of a seasoned hairdresser or a routine split-end trim. It’s for the drastic hair changes, which definitely require some bravery, along with a healthy dose of not giving a damn, to undertake. When you realize that hair isn’t static — it grows back and it grows out — there’s an incredibly liberating feeling that makes it easier to conjure this bravery. This is not to say that drastic hair changes aren’t still peppered with uncertainty. These songs will help accompany the rollercoaster ride of even the brightest pink streaks, the hair-drying bleach, and the scissors that reverse months of hair growth within seconds.
Listen to the playlist here.
“Devils Haircut” by Beck
In the preliminary stages of getting a drastic hair change, inspiration is often drawn from other sources. Maybe it’s boredom or frustration with your own hair. Maybe it’s the sleek box dye ad you saw on the front flap of a magazine at the doctor’s office. “Got a devil’s haircut / In my mind” summarizes the hopeful prospect of rocking a neat new style, which may not be one that you’d show up to an interview with, but one that makes you happy and brimming with anticipation to change up your hair.
“Cut Your Hair” by Pavement
A dopey-sounding tune from a one-hit wonder band (as many ‘90s grunge embodyers were), this song transcends its mandatory “woo hoo hoos” and delves into the problem of changing ourselves in hopes of seeking validation from others. “Darling don't you go and cut your hair / Do you think it's gonna make him change?” points to how our decisions shouldn’t be reflections of how we want others to perceive and accept us. It urges those who are meaning to change their hair to do it out of their own volition, instead of attempting to impress others and adjust their perceptions. At the end of the day, it’s your own hair that you’re changing, and so it should be a decision that you’re comfortable with, a sentiment that this song conveys with a light-hearted, laid-back feel.
“Blood in the Cut” by K.Flay
K.Flay brings us a minimalist yet acerbic tune, one of a more modern generation than the other songs in this playlist. It captures the heat of the moment of following through with your new style. This would be an excellent accompaniment to a frenzied buzzcut in a gas station restroom or in the quiet of your dorm on a rainy Saturday night. “Say something / Do it soon / It’s too quiet in this room” expresses the urgency of wanting to cut it all off right now otherwise-you-are-going-to-implode.
“Where is My Mind?” by the Pixies
Popularized by the film “Fight Club,” the Pixies explore the out-of-body sensation, when you can’t shake the feeling that some part of you is amiss. This is analogous to how it may feel after changing your hair — you see someone quite different in the mirror, and it perhaps is jarring at first to process. Even though you might draw inspiration from other sources, it may be strange to see your Sunday school brown transformed into a Björk blue — the sense of ownership of a constant, personal characteristic seems to have departed. But as we grow, it’s okay to redefine what makes us us. “Where is my mind? / way out in the water / see it swimming” captures finding comfort even when a central part of yourself — your old hair — departs. It describes the sense of disorientation after a drastic departure of a norm, and subsequently finding solace even in the face of this departure.
“Change (In the House of Flies)” by Deftones
This is a viscerally haunting song that really seems capture the listener. The instrumentals really bring an eerie, unsettling atmosphere that reflect the uncomfortable theme of metamorphosis. Lyrics like “I watched a change in you / It’s like you never had wings” regard change as a negative thing — a reaction you might face as well, as not everyone will appreciate your new side shave as much as you do. However you choose to change your hair, disapproving comments may be inevitable, so hearing it from Deftones might prep you to face this criticism. It’s the ultimate preparation for you to answer, “Because I wanted to,” when asked, “Why did you change your hair?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, a celebration of the 30th anniversary of Harvard’s Malcolm Wiener Center for Social Policy was disrupted by student activists seeking to draw attention to divestment efforts. The event was held in the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum, a space at the heart of the Kennedy School created to promote open discussion and debate. The Forum has been the site of many contentious conversations — and some confrontations — that have demonstrated the willingness of our community to welcome challenging viewpoints, even when they are a source of discomfort.
To my knowledge, everyone ever invited to speak at the Forum — indeed, everyone who has been invited to speak at Harvard in recent memory — has been able to do so. That is no longer the case as of last Thursday. Graduate School of Education Dean Bridget Terry Long and I were slated to have a conversation about the role of higher education in expanding economic opportunity. Before we could begin, individuals came forward to sit on the stage, blocking the view of their fellow audience members with signs and chanting loudly over the program. They were invited, first by Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf and then by me, to continue their protest in a way that would not prevent others from participating. They refused to move, and they continued shouting. As a result, members of our community were deprived of the opportunity to engage fully in the work of listening to and learning from one another. The gathering had to be moved to another room that could accommodate only a fraction of the original audience in order for the program to continue.
I have been president for 283 days. In that short span of time, at least half a dozen controversial issues have arisen on our campus, generating impassioned discussions — and even some spirited arguments and public protests. As I said when I spoke at Peking University in March, episodes of disagreement are signs of a healthy campus community. Harvard would be a very dull place if everyone agreed on everything. Even more importantly, this country exists as we know it today because good people have been willing to speak out against injustice and unfairness for centuries. Civil debate is essential to our democracy. So are dissent and protest.
What I saw last week was not a group of students looking to engage in conversation about things that matter to them. It was, instead, an effort to obstruct the rights of others to speak and to listen. A university committed to truth cannot function if some members of our community shout down others. Our University-Wide Statement on Rights and Responsibilities makes clear the right to protest and dissent, but it makes equally clear that this right may not be exercised in a way that interferes with values that are essential to the nature of our enterprise, among them the freedom to exchange ideas.
The heckler’s veto has no place at Harvard. When we shut down conversation, when we shut down debate, we shut down the opportunity to learn through reasoned discourse. It would be a shame if the state of our national public discourse, which has become so coarse, becomes the state of our campus discourse as well. We should strive to model the behavior we would hope to see in the rest of the world. Now is the time to ask ourselves: What kind of community do we want to be?
The choice is ours.
Lawrence S. Bacow is the President of Harvard University.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ruben: I remember my Harvard acceptance well. “It doesn’t matter if I get in or not,” I remember telling my cross country teammates as I opened the portal. The “Congratulations” shone back, they screamed out, and I had to sit down, overwhelmed, smiling non-stop.
I knew what the acceptance signified — success, socioeconomic mobility, prestige, and worth — but I felt unsure how I fit into it. Perhaps this is what you — Class of 2023 admittee — are feeling. You might be wondering what it means to have the Harvard name attached to yours.
Zoe: After I got accepted to Harvard, I had already decided I wasn’t committing. I thought Harvard was synonymous with condescension and snobbery. I expected to be looked down upon for growing up low-income, for being in the first-generation of my family to go to college, and for being a Latina. I was scared of what it would mean to live in a place with racial and socioeconomic demographics that were a far cry from the place where I grew up. I was scared of what Harvard could mean for me.
R: In just a few weeks, we’ll be preparing to welcome you all onto campus for Visitas. As two students involved in Latinx cultural groups, we try transforming Harvard’s campus that weekend so that it’ll resemble the home you’re familiar with, just a little bit more.
Z: Visitas changed everything for me. In those three days, my assumptions of bougieness and exclusivity were challenged. Harvard was not what I thought it would be; instead, I could even see myself calling it home. The person who changed that for me? A Harvard Latina in her junior year. She was the antithesis of every stereotype I’d held about Harvard. It was who she was that inspired me to see the person I could become. She taught me that Harvard could be my chance to help people and that it didn’t mean forgetting who I was and where I came from.
R: There’s a deep tension as we greet you with our smiles and willingness to answer your questions. We want you to love this place, to envision yourself here, to join us and help make this place better, more empathetic, more accommodating to Latinx individuals. There are resources, and we want to make sure you know you deserve to make use of them as much as anyone else. But we’ve also seen how this place strips us down. Microaggressions and classicism make it difficult to be Latinx here. We find ourselves, at times, feeling small and unimportant. So when I tell admitted students about my time at Harvard, I try telling them about both the incredible highs and gut-wrenching lows.
Z: Harvard is far from being perfect. There have been moments at this University that I have been made extremely aware of my class, ethnic background, and gender identity. Every day I carry each facet of my identity. I have cried from the alienation that I’ve felt and I’ve been lost in what it means to exist in spaces that were not created with me in mind. Yet, these experiences are not Harvard specific. I’m a low-income, first-gen Latina at a university that was once exclusively meant for rich and powerful white men. So, the difficulty in being Latinx on any predominantly white campus is not hard to imagine.
R: As admissions processes and affirmative action grip public attention, you may be questioning your acceptance and your place at Harvard. Were you a fluke? Do you belong at a place where you live in a dorm named after your classmates’ ancestors while your grandparents were farmers in El Salvador?
I want my answer to be a resounding “yes,” said loudly and without restraint. Yet though you deserve to be at Harvard as much as anyone else — especially because all the hard work you put into your academics and communities before being admitted — I’m still unsure whether this place deserves you.
Z: But, and I can’t stress this enough, Harvard can be your home. The person I am today, the experiences I carry with me, and my view of the world are all shaped by this University. It is Harvard's resources that have exposed me to more than I could have ever imagined, it is these classrooms that have challenged me to form strong opinions, and it is the Harvard name that has opened doors for me that have historically — and wrongfully — remained closed to our community. We have pushed for this community to be a familia and that is the beauty we hope you see when you come here. A beauty we hope you stay to fight for, preserve, and change.
R: Every year, I quietly mourn those who got away: brilliant, fascinating, thoughtful Latinx students I host as they visit Harvard, only to have them pick a different university. I’m always a little disappointed because I come to admire them as they visit. If they’d chosen Harvard, I like to think we would have been friends and collaborators. But I know that their choice was the right one, that the school they chose over Harvard will benefit from their talents.
No institution is a perfect, painless fit for Latinx students who are still underrepresented in higher education. For those of you who do end up choosing Harvard: Welcome home. We need you here, and we cannot wait to see what you’ll do to shape it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In one of the latest incidents in the ongoing national conversation regarding free speech in higher education — or what some perceive to be a lack thereof — a recent executive order aims to combat this issue financially. The order, signed in March by President Donald Trump, requires federal agencies to link certain federal funds for higher education with institutions that promote “free inquiry” on their campuses. At Harvard, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay recently stated she and the faculty more broadly are unconcerned with any potential effects on the University. Free speech, she said, is “alive and well” on our campus. We wholeheartedly support her response.
Trump’s history of provocative and prevaricating political statements, which are not always backed up by concrete action, leads us to be highly skeptical of this executive order. Primarily, the action appears to be highly partisan. The executive order was initially announced at the Conservative Political Action Conference with rhetoric that plays into a societal trend of pitting conservatives against “rigid, far-left ideology” along the lines of free speech. But it should also be noted that this is not the first time Trump has threatened the removal of funds from higher education. He did so in 2017. No action was taken then.
The language of the executive order itself — as noted by multiple legal scholars — is vague and ambiguous, and, depending on its enforcement, may potentially be unconstitutional. Attempts to solicit a better understanding of the order from administrative officials have met with little clarification.
Our Board has proudly supported free speech and its expression on Harvard’s campus and others in the past, and our sentiment now is as it was then: Not all speakers are equally worth hearing, but all have the right to be heard. Any infringement upon free speech, however offensive, is a threat to our democratic principles and values.
For the most part, our campus has not experienced the extreme and occasionally violent actions seen at some other universities in regards to free speech and student activism. However, in light of recent instances of student protests across campus — which now includes vandalism and peaceful civil disobedience — we hope the University thinks critically about the way it engages with student voices, seeking solutions that respect a variety of different opinions across the ideological spectrum.
Perhaps most of all, we encourage our fellow students to continue to have the confidence and wherewithal to express their voices and opinions, even when power dynamics may be skewed against them. There are many issues on our campus and within higher education that need meaningful and constructive responses. By speaking our minds with courage, we shine the way toward truth, transparency, and progress.

LF, a fashion retailer based in Los Angeles, Calif., closed its Harvard Square store March 30 after operating at its Church Street location for seven years.
The store’s closure comes as other businesses on Church Street have seen decreased foot traffic and shuttered as well. Shannon Lebherz, the former manager of LF Harvard Square, attributed the store’s departure to recent changes in the makeup of the Square’s business offerings.
“What contributed to us leaving were stores like us leaving the Square, too,” Lebherz said. “Free People, Urban Outfitters, American Apparel — they’re all gone. Harvard Square is not a shopping destination anymore.”
LF’s departure is the newest addition to the list of stores — including Urban Outfitters, Chipotle, Starbucks, and Au Bon Pain — that have exited the Square in recent months. Several of the stores have cited development acquisitions as the rationale behind their closings.
Denise A. Jillson, the executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, cited decreased foot traffic in the wake of the Harvard Square Theater’s closing in 2012 as a reason for the commercial turnover in the Church Street area.
“It goes back to what we know about the theater and our concern about that building…being dark for such a long time. The theater closed in July of ’12, we’re coming up on July of ’19, and it’s estimated that there are 1,000 fewer people on Church Street every day,” Jillson said.
Jillson added that the decreasing foot traffic has been a long-standing cause for concern.
“[The HSBA has] been talking to them for quite a while about the store and how to increase foot traffic in the store. As we all know, retail is changing and people are buying more and more online,” she said.
Jillson noted that the building is owned by Gerald L. Chan, a Boston-based billionaire and alumnus of the School of Public Health who owns a considerable portion of Harvard Square’s commercial space.
Chan previously said he wanted to tear down the building housing the theater to add office space, new stores, and a new theater.
Though the Harvard Square location has closed its doors, LF still maintains locations on Newbury Street in Boston and Central Street in Wellesley, Mass. Lebherz said she will miss working at LF Harvard Square and forging relationships with patrons that frequented the store.
“We had girls shop there since they were 11 and 12. We loved working with students in the area,” Lebherz said.
Hayley B. Jaffe ’20, who said she occasionally shopped at LF, said she will miss the place and its convenient location in Harvard Square.
“I often feel that they have a lot of stuff and you can often find a hidden gem here or there,” Jaffe said. “I don’t think I ever walked away empty-handed but I don’t think it was the kind of place where I would go and buy a million things.”
Sarah M. Lightbody ’22, a Crimson Flyby writer, said she was unsurprised by the closing given the prices of LF’s wares.
“I think that they’re a little overpriced for their construction, definitely trendy but I don’t know if they’re necessarily…lasting past the moment’s fashions,” she said.
Jaffe said LF’s closing may be indicative of a broader issue in Harvard Square.
“I think the fact that LF is closing is just a larger comment on how rent is extremely high in Harvard Square and…non-large, chain businesses aren’t really able to thrive here.”

​​​​​​
Enrollment in HBS Online, Harvard Business School’s online education program, spiked by 70 percent in the first months of 2019 following the attachment of the Business School's name in January, Dean of the Business School Nitin Nohria said in an interview April 2.
The program, formerly known as HBX, allows both non-Harvard and Harvard students to earn credentials and certificates from the Business School. Web traffic and enrollment in the courses increased by 40 and 70 percent respectively in January through March 2019 as compared to October through December 2018. In fiscal year 2017, the most recent year from which annual data is available, the program had more than 8,000 participants.
“The impact [of the rebranding] has been immediate,” Nohria said. “We've seen 40 to 50 percent rise in applications already. It's been literally a step change in the number of people who can now find us and through that are applying.”
The school debated changing its name for almost a year before ultimately deciding to rebrand in January to allow more people to reach its online program. The program has already seen about 40,000 people complete a course since its inception in 2014.
“Most people did not know that HBX was actually associated with Harvard Business School,” Nohria said. “We said, ‘You know, we're proud of it, so why should we not put our name on an education experience we are proud of?’”
Business School administrators also felt at the time that the HBX program had proven itself to be a worthy part of the larger Harvard Business School apparatus — another source of motivation for the rebranding, according to Nohria.
“We wanted it to be case based, we wanted it to be interactive, we wanted it to be engaging, we wanted to have high completion rates,” Nohria said. “By this year we had developed a confidence that in fact we could do all of these things.”
Simeen Ali, managing director of marketing and product management at the Business School, said other factors, including changes in HBS Online’s marketing strategy, could also contribute to the rise in enrollment and web traffic.
“We have also expanded our marketing efforts to include more direct marketing in the international arena,” Ali said. “And then a third factor is that we have more courses that are starting as well.”
Ali said program administrators expect to see demand for the online courses remain high in the aftermath of the rebranding. She added that HBS Online has the infrastructure necessary to keep up with the increased demand.
“We hope to continue to see the gains throughout the year as well, and going forward, we feel like we've barely scratched the surface of people being aware that you can take these programs,” she said.
Ali also said the increase in demand has been equally distributed among all of the online classes offered under the HBS Online umbrella.
“I wouldn't say that there's anything in particular that spiked as a result, but the increase in traffic has really been distributed across all the courses,” she said.
Nohria said he hopes this surge in interest in the programs will not lower the quality of the applicant pool.
“When people think of the name, they think that they have to be a quality person to apply because that's built into the very ethos and reputation of Harvard,” Nohria said. “We think that, all in all, it has been a very good move for the school.”

UPDATED: April 11, 2019 at 11:45 a.m.
Harvard Management Company updated its website within the last month to remove any mention of past instances of divestment and to include references to its protocols on its investment in land and agriculture.
For years, Harvard affiliates have sharply criticized HMC — the University’s investment arm — for its investments in fossil fuel companies and most recently, companies tied to the prison industry. Activists have also raised concerns about some of Harvard’s nearly $40 billion endowment’s being used to buy farmland in California and Brazil.
The old webpage contained several paragraphs about Harvard’s attitude and historical practices regarding divestment — which appear to have been removed in the new version of the site.
The old page also noted that Harvard is generally against divestment because the University does not want its investments to be viewed as political or controversial.
“Harvard conceives of the endowment fundamentally as an economic resource, not as a lever to advance political positions or to exert economic pressure for social purposes, which could entail serious risks to the independence of the academic enterprise and the ideal of free inquiry,” the old page read.
But the site stated that, on “very rare occasions,” the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — may encourage HMC to divest from companies with “deeply repugnant and ethically unjustifiable” activities. It cited companies involved in South African apartheid, tobacco, and the Darfur genocide as historical examples of when Harvard has divested.
Harvard divested from the tobacco industry in 1990 and companies tied to the Sudanese government in 2005. The school also withdrew some of its investments from firms that conducted business with the South African apartheid government in the 1980s. In those cases, Harvard divested its own direct holdings, but not those held in externally managed funds, which make up a significant portion of their holdings.
The new website, however, does not contain any references to divestment.
Activists from prisons and fossil fuel divestment campaigns have been escalating their efforts in recent months. Last week, protestors from both activist groups protested at University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s speech at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum, resulting in the event relocating to another room.
Divestment advocates have also circulated multiple petitions calling for divestment, rallied in Harvard Yard, and met privately with Bacow to discuss their issues with the University’s investments.
Beyond its omission of divestment literature, the new website also includes a new section regarding Harvard’s investment in natural resources. The section notes that HMC strives to be a “good steward” of the land it manages.
“We believe that ethical conduct, responsible stewardship of the environment, and respect for those with whom we do business are essential to the performance of our farmland and forestry investments,” the website reads.
The website includes guidelines for investments in natural resources, including expectations for compliance with existing land rights and laws, as well as respect for human and labor rights associated with the land.
The old website contained one document about Harvard’s philosophy toward natural resources investment, but it was not as prominently featured as it is now.
HMC spokesperson Patrick S. McKiernan wrote in an emailed statement, "We are proud to launch a new website that is more user friendly and includes extensive information about our approach to sustainable investing among other important topics."
Harvard has been under legal pressure in the past year for its natural resources investments in California, Brazil, and other areas.
A Harvard-owned vineyard in California’s Central Valley drew vocal criticism for its potential effect on local groundwater supplies. After an initial environmental review was conducted, neighboring ranchers filed an appeal of the project, calling for a more extended analysis of its effects. Last month, a county board ruled that a more extensive environmental review is necessary.

The Dean of Students Office has suspended the creation of new “gift accounts” for student organizations due to personnel vacancies, a DSO administrator wrote in an email to the leadership of the Harvard College Social Enterprise Association Monday.
“Unfortunately, as we are currently so short staffed on our Finance team, we have suspended the creation of new gift accounts,” Kate Colleran, senior director for student organizations and resources at the Dean of Students Office, wrote in the email.
Gift accounts are owned by the University and allow College student organizations to receive tax-deductible support from donors. Harvard can receive donations on behalf of the groups via the gift accounts and then provide official acknowledgement stating the gift is tax-deductible for use in tax reporting, according to the DSO website. Without such an account, if the group is not incorporated as a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization, gifts may not be tax-deductible.
Allison P. Pao ’21, who serves as HCSEA’s co-chair of International Projects, emailed Colleran Saturday to inquire about creating a gift account for donations toward an international trip. HCSEA seeks to support English education in East Asia and coordinates two service trips each spring break, according to its website.
Colleran notified HCSEA leadership in a subsequent email that low staffing levels preclude the DSO from setting up such accounts at this time, and the organization should instead continue to deposit donations into its account at Harvard University Employees Credit Union.
In an email to The Crimson Monday, Colleran attributed the suspension of gift accounts to “open positions that need to be filled.” She wrote that gift account creation will resume once the required personnel are hired over the summer.
“One position was vacated only a couple weeks ago, so someone most likely won't be hired until summer. Once the person is in, we will look to have them work on gift accounts,” Colleran wrote. “We get quite a few requests for opening gift accounts, but with a minimum of a $10,000 deposit, very few of those groups actually qualify for one.”
“Groups who do not have one, can still take donations to their bank accounts and need to be sure to be clear with their donors about that,” she added.
HCSEA Co-President Lily Gao ’21 wrote in an email to The Crimson that the group “relies almost exclusively on donations” to fund its volunteering due to restrictions placed on grants from the University and the Undergraduate Council. She wrote she is concerned the suspension of new gift accounts may impede donors’ ability to make tax-deductible contributions to the organization.
“Because our trip is international and focused on education and philanthropy, this means we can't get adequate funding from University sources,” Gao wrote. “Not having a gift account for donors to make tax-exempt donations is an unnecessary burden placed on HCSEA and its donors.”

Former Vice President Al Gore ’69 said President Donald Trump has pursued a “radically new” strategy by ignoring Americans outside of his core constituency at an Institute of Politics event Wednesday evening.
Before the event began, Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf discussed the right of free speech in the wake of student protestors' interruption of a talk featuring University President Lawrence S. Bacow last week. The demonstration, put on by fossil fuel and prison divestment activists, resulted in Bacow and his fellow speakers leaving the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum and continuing the event in a classroom.
In front of a packed crowd, Gore told audience members that the status quo is “not normal” while speaking on a panel entitled “The American Presidency in the 21st Century” at the Institute of Politics Monday evening.
“Uniquely, President Trump has persistently followed a strategy of ignoring, for the most part, those outside of his base and has concentrated on keeping his base in a high fever, in a state of agitation and enthusiasm for him standing against everybody who’s outside the base,” Gore said. “That is something radically new in the American presidency.”
Gore also opined on social media, economic inequality, and demagoguery. Gore said stagnant income growth among the middle class has contributed to the current state of political affairs.
“The very fact that we have gone more than 40 years with no increase in real take-home pay for middle class Americans is the most salient fact explaining what is going on right now,” Gore said.
Hosted in honor of the hundredth birthday of Richard E. Neustadt — the first director of the IOP, a professor at the Kennedy School, and a renowed political scientist — the panel also featured historian Doris K. Goodwin, Kennedy School professor Roger B. Porter, and former Harvard provost Harvey V. Fineberg ’67. Neustadt advised five presidents before passing away in 2003.
Goodwin said citizen movements have historically helped Americans escape turmoil and hardship.
"You have to look back to history to get some help for the present. It seems to me the real echo of what we're in now is the turn of the 20th century. The industrial revolution had shaken up the economy, much as the tech revolution and globalization have done,” she said. “But what helped us through that was a movement among the citizens, the progressive movement.”
“I think that’s still the answer for us today. Every change in the country comes from the citizens up,” she added.
Gore also noted the importance of the “printed word” throughout American history.
“I think for most of our country's existence, we really took for granted the extent to which the printed word informed all of the deliberations of our founders and all of the practices and culture of self-governance,” he said.
In explaining his fears about social media, Gore mentioned shortening attention spans and increasing amounts of content vying for that attention.
“The kinds of meetings, the kinds of civic associations, the kinds of conversations across the backyard fence that used to take place are now displaced all too often by entertainment, and cat videos, and memes of all sorts,” Gore said.
“In order for the promise of representative democracy and self-governance to be redeemed in the twenty-first century, we have to find that the majority of people are willing to devote time and attention to the role of the citizen in the self-governing process,” he added.
In his remarks before the event, Elmendorf read the University-Wide Statement on Rights and Responsibilities to attendees and followed with his own words on the topic of freedom of speech.
"Here at the Kennedy School each of us exercises our freedom of speech by talking in turn and listening when it’s other people’s turns," Elmendorf said. "Such civil discourse is essential to our learning and we insist upon it in classrooms, in hallways, and most definitely here at events in the forum. Without the chance for members of our community to hear and be heard we would be a much poorer place.”
Elmendorf went on to say that anyone who disrupted the program would be asked to leave and would be "subject to appropriate disciplinary action in their school."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There were just 73 seconds remaining in the contest, as Columbia senior captain Lindsey Ewertsen stood confidently at the eight meter arc awaiting her free-position shot attempt. With the score knotted at 14 apiece, the All Ivy League selection fired her seventh and final shot on the night past sophomore Crimson goalkeeper Grace Rotondo, ending the offensive evening showdown.
Saturday, the Columbia Lions (3-9, 1-3 Ivy League) secured their first Ivy League victory of the season over Harvard, (5-6, 1-3) winning by a 15 to 14 scoreline. The matchup showcased the teams’ offensive power, as both went on scoring runs ultimately culminating in a dramatic ending.
In the final two minutes of play, freshman midfielder Shea Jenkins received a yellow card in an attempt to break up a Lions’ offensive rush — giving Ewertsen all the opportunity she needed to finalize the Columbia victory. The Lions notched two goals in the final 3:16 of the second stanza. However, after Ewertson’s goal, one minute and thirteen seconds still remained in the contest.
A draw control by the Crimson would have provided plenty of opportunity for Harvard to tie the game, but sophomore Lions’ midfielder Alison Schwasnick had other ideas. Despite the Crimson concluding the contest up 20-10 in draw controls, the Crimson lost the most important one of the afternoon at the hands of Schwasnick.
The execution of free-position shots proved to be the determining factor between the two squads. The Lions were six for 13 in their free-position attempts while Harvard only managed to capitalize on one of seven. The Crimson also struggled with ground balls, ending up with a 30-22 deficit to the Lions.
The teams traded leads back and forth throughout the contest, yet at the 20 minute mark, Columbia’s offense took over. The Lions went on a five goal tear, putting them up 13-11 over the Crimson. But Harvard had not conceded yet.
At the 15-minute mark, Harvard responded with a trio of goals themselves. As the shot clock winded down to two seconds, senior captain Keeley MacAfee received a long pass from senior attacker Nicole Baiocco and rifled it past Lions junior goaltender Abby Roberts to put the Crimson up one with 6:38 left in the match. A pair of penalties from the Crimson late in the contest would prove to be too much to recover from, however.
Midfielders Bridget Flynn and Jenkins both received yellow cards within the final two minutes of the contest. Yet Harvard coach Devon Wills attributed the 15-14 loss not to the late penalties taken, but to a lack of execution earlier on in the contest.
“I don’t fault those kids for those cards,” said Coach Wills of Jenkins and Flynn. “We had plenty of opportunities before that.”
Both keepers made saves at crucial moments to hold their teams in the game as well. Keeping the Lions within striking distance, Columbia backstop Roberts halted a point blank shot given up by her defense while the Crimson looked to extend their 11-8 lead. The Columbia net-minder made nine saves on the evening while Crimson backstop Grace Rotondo recorded 14.
The Lions relied heavily on their speed and athleticism in order to secure the win over the Crimson.
“They did a great job of exploiting [their speed],” Coach Wills stated. “They’re a really well coached team and they’re very athletic and I think they used that to their advantage today.”
The Crimson drew upon the leadership, offense, and play-making ability of their captain MacAfee in its attempt to fend off the Lions. The All-Ivy League midfielder tallied five goals and two assists in the contest, leading the Crimson in both categories for the evening. MacAfee also leads the team in both goals and points for the year.
The last meeting between the two teams in March of 2018 ended in a similar result, with a 14-13 loss for the Crimson.
“We had a hard battle with them last year,” MacAfee said of the Lions. “Any game in the Ivies are going to be a hard battle...but we’re just going to use it to fuel us to move forward for the rest of our season.”
Despite Harvard starting out 1-3 in conference play, opportunities loom to recover those points. Currently sitting at sixth in the Ivy League standings, the Crimson will look to make up that deficit in the three remaining conference matchups against Princeton, Brown and Penn.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Crimson’s slate of games this past weekend marked the last time that its senior leaders would be playing in Blodgett Pool. Facing off against George Washington, Bucknell, and St. Francis in a repeat of the previous week’s matchups in the nation’s capital, the Crimson looked to capitalize in its final stretch of home games with decisive victories against its conference opponents.
The seniors were honored before their second game on Saturday, a meeting with Bucknell for the third time this season. Senior keeper Samantha Acker’s impressive 13-save performance against the Bison kept the game low-scoring, but Bucknell edged out Harvard, scoring nine goals to the Crimson’s seven.
With the start of the CWPA Championships approaching, senior leadership will be more important than ever before, as Harvard looks to build off its impressive regular season with a deep playoff run.
Here is a look at the seniors who will be leading the Crimson into the postseason:
Samantha Acker
The team’s senior captain has been a key part of the team since her start with the program. In her debut for the Crimson, Acker filled up the stat sheet, recording 12 saves, a steal, and an assist in a contest against Villanova. She would go on to finish her freshman campaign with 55 saves.
Her sophomore contest was highlighted by an ACWPC Superior All-Academic Team selection, which rounded off a successful year as Acker recorded 79 saves to go along with 20 assists and 21 steals. Against George Washington that year, Acker recorded a career-high five assists to go along with eight saves.
Having six games with double-digit saves, Acker showed her dominance in goal as a Junior. She ended the year with 163 saves along with 17 assists and nine steals earning the title of captain for her last year with the team.
Leading the team in her final season, Acker has set an example for the freshmen, namely first-year goalkeeper Zoe Banks, to follow. Banks, in fact, was good friends with Samantha when the two were teammates in Henry M. Gunn High School.
“It's really important to be friends with your other goalie. We spend so much of our time together and we train everyday together,” said Acker, referring to the close bond that the two goalkeepers share. “Watching her grow here has been so great.”
Haley Bowe
The Irvine, Calif. native has been a key to the Crimson’s defense. In her first year with the program, Bowe saw playing time against No. 9 San Jose State, where she capitalized and scored one of her 11 goals on the season. She also saw time in the CWPA Championships, where she tallied two steals against Hartwick, adding to the nine other steals on the season.
In her sophomore and junior campaigns, Bowe saw increased action and contributed once again to the defensive side of the game. Scoring 27 goals and recording 39 steals over those two years, Bowe was an important piece to the squad.
Yet her leadership may be one of her most important contributions to the team.
“She's definitely helped a lot of the younger players, especially the ones who are going into pre-med or biology concentrations.” said Acker, discussing the Neurobiology major’s dedication to helping others academically.
Kristen Hong
Kristen Hong’s ability to score has been evident since her start with the program in 2016. As a freshman, Hong led the team with 80 goals, tying the single-season program record. She would continue to lead the squad in scoring throughout her sophomore and junior years, and she is currently on pace to be the top goal-scorer for the Crimson in 2019 as well.
Her ability to score from the start earned her Team Rookie of the Year honors, and her continued success placed her on the CWPA all-conference squad her sophomore year before being named to the All-CWPA Division-I second team in her junior campaign.
To go along with these honors, Hong’s performance in the pool set a program record, as she broke the program’s career goals record in her final season at Harvard, surpassing 250 career goals to amend the record books.
“During the CWPA Eastern Championships my freshman year, [our former social media correspondent] watched me score a half-court goal and remembers this entire time,” recalls Hong after a recent encounter with the correspondent when reflecting on her most memorable goal during her time with the program.
The three seniors look to continue their impactful performances in the postseason, which begins after a final conference matchup against Michigan this Saturday. Entering the CWPA Championships for their last time, the Harvard fourth-years hope to make a deep push and cap off their historic regular season with some hardware.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past weekend was an eventful one for Harvard golf. The men’s and women’s teams both traveled to Princeton, N.J. for the Princeton Invitational and Matchplay Madness events, respectively.
The men competed in their traditional stroke play style, placing ninth out of the 13 teams with a combined score of 864. On the other hand, Yale rode a scorching-hot second-round score of 270 to victory as they finished with a total of 829. This mark was a whopping 14 strokes better than second-place Pennsylvania.
Thus, it is no surprise that three out of the top six golfers on the individual leaderboard were Bulldogs. A pair of sophomores, Paul Stankey and Teddy Zinsner, took first and second with scores of 202 and 204 over three rounds of play.
Stankey in particular played some impressive golf. He led all athletes with 17 birdies, and he did most of his damage on par-fours, where he was eight-under-par for the weekend. This play resulted in a tournament-best score of 64 in his second round.
The top Crimson golfer was freshman Brian Isztwan. He finished even for the invitational which translated to an individual finish of 16th. Isztwan notched his best score of 68 in the first round and piled in 10 birdies along with 35 pars in total.
“I think we’ve all been doing the right things and I’ve found some stuff over the winter that’s been super successful for me,” Isztwan said. “I think we’re all making strides in the right direction, and I like what I’m seeing from everyone on the team. I think we’re in a really good place right now.”
This is the freshman’s second consecutive strong showing. In the spring season opener at the Michigan Desert Mountain Tournament, Isztwan recorded the second-best Harvard score with 30 pars and eight birdies.
Junior Ryan Rhee was next in line for the Crimson, finishing at four-over-par (217) for the weekend. Placing in the top 40 individually were sophomore Peter George and junior Rij Patel with scores of 219.
This experience was quite different than that of the Harvard women. The team was able to compete in a special matchplay format, which involved scoring based on head-to-head matchups against opponents from another team.
“That’s not an opportunity that we’re given often,” senior Anna Zhou said. “Our tournaments are typically stroke play so it was a fun event for everyone to play in. Also, given that it’s the event right before Ivies, we were able to assess where we stand as a team and see what we needed to work on.”
This different style of competition was a refreshing change of pace for the team, and for Zhou specifically. She won her last two matchups, against Princeton and Pennsylvania, to go 2-1 on the weekend.
“I think matchplay has always been something I do fairly well in because it helps me stay present and focus on one hole at a time,” Zhou said. “I think that the match play format has always been compatible with me as a player. I think overall my game’s in a pretty good spot right now.”
Freshman Elizabeth Wang was the only Crimson golfer to top Zhou’s mark. She swept her three matchups to become one of only four golfers at the event to go unbeaten. Like Isztwan on the men’s side, Wang’s strong performance is a continuation from her first spring tournament. There, she snagged fifth on the individual leaderboard to lead Harvard to second place.
That being said, it was quite a balanced effort for the Crimson. All seven golfers won at least one matchup, and five of them finished .500 or better. This culminated in a third-place finish at the event. Harvard had split results on the first day, beating Brown but then falling to the Tigers. The squad managed to finish strong on the second day, making quick work of the Quakers.
Now both the men and women will turn their sights to the future. Next up for the women’s team are the Ivy League Championships beginning on April 19th. The men will have one last tune-up, the Yale Opener, before they too begin the Ivy League Championships on the same day as the women.
“Compared to how our fall went, we are really much improved and super excited,” Isztwan said. “It’s a lot of work that goes into it but I think we’re seeing the right stuff… [We have to just] keep doing what we’re doing, controlling the controllables and doing the right stuff."

The Barker Cafe has given this Humanities concentrator yet another reason to live: the new chocolate croissant. On principle, I am against spending my own money at BoardPlus locations (even though I know that I’m sort of paying Harvard for my “free money”), but I might actually fork some over for this delight of a pastry. I have watched plenty of “Great British Bake Off,” so I am extremely qualified to detail why this croissant is a divine blessing.
Let’s start by reminding our readers what the old chocolate croissant was like. It was very similar to the kind that Starbucks calls a chocolate croissant — which is to say, it was actually a pain au chocolat. A smallish pastry square with two solid bars of chocolate running through the middle, the faux croissant (fauxsant?) provided a decent amount of satisfaction, even if it wasn’t the most filling thing the cafe sold.
The new croissant? It is bigger, better, and more chocolatey than ever. I could eat the fauxsant as a pre-class snack and still be famished by the five-minute break in the middle of a seminar. The new and improved version is a breakfast in itself. I need to take a five-minute break from eating it so I can pay attention to class.
It’s actually shaped like a croissant, for starters, which (thanks to Google Translate) means “crescent” in French. The tips of this decadent crescent actually meet, so puffy and fulsome is this croissant. The chocolate drizzle is a nice touch, and the first time I ate this I figured that was the only chocolate content.
I was wrong.
The middle of the croissant contains a chocolate butter-type filling — like Nutella without the nuts — which makes for the perfect mid-pastry surprise (sorry to ruin the surprise). The best pastry offering can be further optimized, however. As nice as the croissant is, sitting in a pastry case all day dries it out, so try out this treat earlier in the day rather than later. (Also, these babies run out. If you’re the one eating all the croissants for breakfast on Wednesdays, meet me outside Barker tomorrow at noon. We need to talk.)
See, I could have kept this pastry secret all to myself, but I’m eating one as I write this so I feel pretty magnanimous. That’s just the beauty of the chocolate croissant. Treat yourself. Love yourself. Croissant yourself.
