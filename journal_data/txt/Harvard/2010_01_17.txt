After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The cachet of the Harvard brand name came into play on the bond market when the University sold $480 million of debt last week and beat benchmark interest rates—an indication that the University’s bonds remain in high demand despite Harvard’s budgetary troubles.
The longest-term bonds issued this week were priced to yield 4.02 percent over 24 years, or 0.3 percent lower than the benchmark for securities of similar quality. The below-market yield means that Harvard will pay investors less interest than average on its tax-exempt debt, but the exact savings to the University were not available this week.
Harvard’s latest bond sale brought the school’s outstanding debt to $6.5 billion dollars, a debt load comparable to that of the city of Chicago. Proceeds from the sale—which attracted a mix of investors including high net worth individuals, hedge funds, and insurance companies—will be used to fund a building project at the Law School and to refinance previously issued University debt.
Executives at Barclays—which headed a group of five investment banks that managed the bond sale—said in interviews with The Crimson last week that Harvard’s bonds were particularly appealing to investors given the University’s excellent credit rating and its strong reputation in the market. A high level of demand tends to drive down the yield on bonds.
The executives said they considered the below-market rates on Harvard’s latest debt issuance unusual but not surprising, in part due to the University’s strong brand name.
“Credit strength, scarcity value, and brand recognition combine for pretty good execution,” said Jim Merli, a managing director at Barclays.
Harvard rarely issues debt, has nearly universal name recognition, and is located in a state with “strong wealth demographics,” said Steve Milano, who is also a managing director at Barclays, noting that these factors contributed to the success of the sale.
Milano added that investors and companies facing high marginal tax rates found these bonds particularly appealing because they were tax-exempt.
Harvard’s money managers have said in the past that maintaining the University’s “AAA” credit rating is one of their top priorities. Though many colleges and universities, including Dartmouth, have seen their credit ratings downgraded due to fallout from the economic recession, outsiders remain confident in Harvard’s ability to repay its debt.
“At the moment Harvard’s credit rating is not in question in investors’ minds, as evidenced by this sale,” said one source close to the deal who asked not to be named discussing Harvard’s credit rating in order to preserve his relationship with the University.
Last year, in the midst of the financial crisis, Harvard sold $2.5 billion worth of bonds at a higher yield and received scrutiny for issuing debt during an unfavorable financial climate. A Forbes cover story suggested that Harvard was at a disadvantage in the bond market because it acted in a “cash-raising panic.”
But supporters of the University’s sale said at the time that, given the unfavorable financial climate, those bond prices were unavoidable and a product of the credit crunch—and not the result of the University’s actions or financial situation.
A portion of this week’s sale will fund the Law School’s Northwest Corner Building, a complex that will house a student center, the school’s growing clinics, and classrooms.
The building is scheduled for completion during the winter of 2011.
University administrators have halted or slowed other capital projects, most notably Harvard’s campus expansion across the Charles River. But construction on the Northwest Corner Building proved more expensive to halt than to continue, according to statements by former interim Law School Dean Howell E. Jackson last year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Searching for a lightly-used futon or selling your dog-eared Gov. 20 coursepack will soon become a bit easier with the upcoming official launch of Crimsonlist, Harvard’s version of the online classifieds Web site Craigslist.
The Web site—which enables students to coordinate campus-wide purchases and sales of items ranging from textbooks to refrigerators—was created by Sasank Konda ’12 and Kane Hsieh ’12 as their final project for Computer Science 50. The site will be launched on The Harvard Crimson’s Web site by the beginning of shopping period.
As part of their campaign to lead the Undergraduate Council, President Johnny F. Bowman ’11 and Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11 proposed the development of a Web site akin to Craigslist for Harvard students. Hysen said that the pair had originally considered building their own site, but after learning about Konda and Hsieh’s creation, the UC leaders decided they did not want to “mis-replicate something that was already being done well.”
In early December, Hysen and Bowman approached Konda and Hsieh—who serve as Crimson Contract Printing Manager and Associate Photography Editor, respectively—about collaborating to publicize the site.
“From the UC’s end, we want to continue to promote the site to the entire campus and make sure that all 6,600 students know about it and can use it,” Hysen said.
Bowman said he believes that hosting Crimsonlist on The Crimson’s Web site will guarantee that the online tool receives all the necessary resources and public leverage to ensure long-term success. The lack of publicity is typically the highest hurdle that student-run Web sites face in developing a lasting presence on campus, Bowman said.
Konda said that the development of a Harvard version of Craigslist has been attempted several times before, but preceding versions ultimately fizzled out because they were either difficult to navigate or lacking in visual appeal.
“You wouldn’t think that the aesthetic is that terribly important, but if a site doesn’t look legit, then you don’t want to use it,” Konda said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For those North Allston residents who hoped to see their neighborhood revitalized by the expansion of Harvard’s campus, the past few weeks have not brought the desired holiday tidings.
Early last month, Harvard President Drew G. Faust announced that the University would indefinitely halt construction on the Allston Science Complex in the early spring due to financial constraints. The roughly $1 billion project represents the first component of Harvard’s ambitious 50-year plan to construct an extension of its campus across the Charles River.
A week later, the Boston Redevelopment Authority approved after much debate a plan to relocate the Charlesview Apartment complex—a concrete cluster of 213 low-income housing units located near the Business School—into the heart of North Allston as part of a land swap agreement between Harvard and the Charlesview Board of Directors. The plan, which received approval from Boston’s Zoning Commission last week, has long been the subject of impassioned community discussions and has endured heated criticism from some neighborhood residents.
While these developments might appear to be momentous defeats for community activists, others find themselves optimistic and buoyed by Harvard’s plans for the community in the coming months. University planners said that they are redoubling their efforts to find tenants for vacant Harvard-owned properties in Allston—in fact, Harvard recently opened a free indoor ice skating rink in the area—and certainly, some residents said they are more confident now about the fate of their neighborhood than they have been for many years.
A TOUGH MONTH FOR ALLSTON
In early December, Faust sent a letter to the Harvard community stating that the University would halt construction of the Allston Science Complex, which for years has been touted as a hub for interdisciplinary research and a cornerstone of Harvard’s future campus across the river. The decision, Faust wrote, resulted from the “altered financial landscape of the University, and the wider world.”
The news did not come without warning: Harvard announced last February that it would slow construction in Allston while it examined alternative options for phasing and development. But while residents said that they were not shocked by the news of the construction freeze, they were certainly not pleased.
“It was no surprise because [Faust] had been preparing us for it over the last year, so it was a formalization of that, and I think we all knew it,” said longtime Allston resident Tim McHale. “My overall reaction is that I feel sorry that it can’t move forward both for Harvard and for the community.”
The announcement that the BRA had approved the relocation of the Charlesview Apartments elicited similar reactions from Allston residents. After a long struggle to have their voices heard, the ending has been disappointing for many.
The plan to relocate Charlesview had been informally proposed by Harvard officials in 2003 and materialized into an agreement with Charlesview officials in 2007. But the plan languished as it underwent continuous revisions and community input meetings, and a vocal contingent of community leaders had criticized the plan, suggesting that the project would create an income-segregated North Allston neighborhood.
The critiques raised by residents led to a series of redesigns by architects hired by the Charlesview Board, and the final amendments to the plan were presented to the community just a week before the BRA first reviewed the plan for approval in December. The changes aimed to reduce the density of the apartment complex and respect the aesthetics of the neighborhood, and also included more retail space along Western Ave.
Despite such efforts, many Allston residents thought the plan could have seen further improvement. At the final community input meeting in December, McHale and other Allston residents proposed a ten-point plan to improve the design, which included allowing space for backyards in the housing units and moving a nearby McDonald’s to make room for a more attractive plaza on Western Avenue. The residents wanted “more of a neighborhood feel,” McHale had said at the meeting.
But the BRA approved the plan last month without those changes—a move that residents said they found disappointing but not surprising.
Allston-Brighton Task Force Member and Allston resident Bruce E. Houghton took a more moderate view, emphasizing his “disappointment that there wasn’t greater improvement in the site itself.”
But McHale said he hoped that the BRA would be amenable to discussing some of his proposed amendments to the plan.
“We have good signals that a lot of [the changes] can happen,” McHale said. “We have signals that we can get into a dialogue with the BRA.”
‘ON THE VERGE OF SOMETHING GREAT’
McHale’s optimistic outlook in the face of recent disappointment appears to be one shared by many Allston community leaders. In the face of letdowns, the Allston community has forged ahead with different community projects.
Faust’s December letter to the community did not simply announce a halt in construction on the Science Complex, but also outlined a new three-phase plan for redevelopment in Allston: “property stewardship and community engagement; campus planning and greening; and campus development.”
The first phase of the project has already begun, according to Chief University Planner Kathy Spiegelman, and it aims to lease out Harvard-owned properties in Allston and improve real estate holdings to make them more desirable for occupants. The University is also looking to extend short-term lease contracts and encourage real estate brokers to aggressively pursue potential tenants.
Last Friday, Harvard opened a free indoor skating rink in Allston to couple its community engagement and property stewardship efforts. The rink—which will be open to the public until the end of March—aims to “bring creative, community-oriented uses to Allston properties while seeking long term tenants for its buildings,” according to a University press release.
“After spending a number of years thinking very longer term about these properties and how all the pieces fit together in the long-term, its clear that right now we’re focused much more on property stewardship,” Spiegelman said.
The second phase of the University’s development plan for Allston involves greening the community, and the planning of Library Park—a public park for the neighborhood behind the Honan Allston Library—has also already begun, according to Spiegelman.
The third and final phase of the new plan—furthering general campus development in Allston—includes the creation of a new faculty-led Work Team, which Faust characterized in her letter as having “expertise in design, urban planning, business strategy, real estate development, and public policy.” The committee will be led by Peter Tufano, senior associate dean for planning and university affairs at Harvard Business School, Bill P. Purcell, director of the Institute of Politics and former mayor of Nashville, Tennessee, and Alex Krieger, chair of the department of urban planning and design at the Graduate School of Design.
Spiegelman said that the committee will be expected to meet for the next 12 to 18 months, holding discussions with various community and University leaders to devise recommendations and advice for Faust.
“It’s very important to everyone at Harvard that the setback in construction not be interpreted as walking away from Allston,” Spiegelman said. But she also noted that she was “uncertain about when the major redevelopment was going to kick in.”
Indeed, some residents remain cautious about the University’s course of action in Allston. Houghton said that he was “very pessimistic” about Allston’s future and that he would wait to see if the faculty Work Team could deliver results before casting further judgment. He also said that he was surprised at other residents’ hopeful attitude.
“I’m not sure how they could find that optimism or where they could find it,” Houghton said. “I don’t think for any of the parties involved this is a time for great optimism. Everybody’s disappointed.”
But Harry Mattison, an Allston community leader and a mainstay at neighborhood meetings, said that many residents believe that Harvard’s new plan of action is “a great step in the right direction.”
“I’m more optimistic now than I have been in quite a while,” Mattison said, adding that the professors named to the Work Team are “highly distinguished and have hearts in the right place.”
“With their leadership, the involvement of other interested faculty, and community input, this could really lay the foundation for a much better way forward than what we’ve been looking at in the recent past,” Mattison said.
“If we can just start a meaningful dialogue with meaningful goals, I would be very excited about that,” McHale said, echoing Mattison’s sentiments. The neighborhood, he added, is “coming together...we’re on the verge of something great.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s plans to sell a 62.5-acre parcel of land to the Town of Weston, Mass. have been temporarily derailed after engineers discovered high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil, and the sale—nearly a month overdue—has been put on hold until the University’s cleanup of the land.
Weston, an affluent town of 12,000 located 10 miles west of Cambridge, had already secured financing for the $22.5 million land purchase, said Town Manager Donna S. VanderClock. In 2006, Weston had agreed to purchase the property from Harvard, which had acquired the open plot of land in Weston—called the Case Estates—as a gift in 1942.
But the recent discovery of potentially hazardous levels of arsenic in the soil—likely the remains of lead-based pesticides once used in orchards on the site—has brought the transaction to a momentary stop, according to the town’s Web site.
“We [were] ready with the money. It’s in the bank,” VanderClock said. “Then we discovered this problem with the land.”
The contamination currently poses no health risks since the arsenic remains underground, but Harvard must now “remediate” the soil—to remove or contain the affected soil—to facilitate the completion of the sale, according to James Gray, associate vice president of Harvard Real Estate Services.
While arsenic contamination is typically eliminated by removing affected soil, Harvard is considering “encapsulating” contaminated areas, essentially burying affected soil, Gray said. This option not only costs less but also preserves the site’s aesthetic appeal, as the removal of soil would lead to the uprooting of vegetation. Gray added that the “encapsulating” method is environmentally safe, as long as the land is held in perpetuity as green space.
But Weston’s governing Board of Selectmen—the executive branch of the town’s government—will not agree to purchase any land in which contaminants remain, according to VanderClock.
“We’re ready to buy the land when it is clean, but we will not purchase contaminated land and take on that liability,” she said.
At the Jan. 28 Weston town meeting, Harvard representatives plan to present an alternate plan in which the University would retain ownership of approximately 15 to 17 acres of contaminated land—parcels with permanent restrictions on their usage that would likely preclude any future development or agriculture on the sites. The remaining 45 to 47 acres of uncontaminated land would be sold to the town at a reduced price.
“We think there will be very little cost and very little liability to the University to holding onto the contaminated and encapsulated land, or we wouldn’t be considering it,” Gray said, adding that in the future, Harvard could sell the land to another non-profit group.
A Moody’s Investors Service report issued Thursday stated that Weston intended to sell $32 million in bonds, of which $19.5 million in bonds would finance the purchase of the land plot, according to a Dec. 17 presentation prepared by the town. Other revenue from the bond sales will go towards public work projects, the report stated.
The Case Estates are considered the most desirable open space in Weston, according to VanderClock. The “pastoral” site—which contains both woodlands and meadows—was formerly used as an auxiliary facility for Harvard’s Arnold Arboretum, according to former arboretum director Robert E. Cook ’68.
For years, the premises housed nurseries and experimental growing facilities, but the arboretum has since consolidated those functions into its main, 265-acre reservation in Boston, Cook told The Crimson in 2006.
Harvard began discussing selling the property about four years ago, according to Gray.
“The University has held property for a long time, but has never been able to make effective use of marrying it into the academic mission,” Gray said. “We decided it was in the interest of the University to liquidate the asset.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With such a start to the New Year, the Harvard skiing team has to be wondering if there will ever be an end to its woes.
The Crimson continued its stretch of poor showings at the St. Lawrence Winter Carnival this weekend, where the team’s performance entertained no one. The two-day tournament took place at Mt. Van Hovenberg in Lake Placid, N.Y., a scenic Olympic village that saw Harvard finish ninth out of 15 on the charts.
The Crimson only achieved a score of 349.0, 608 points below first-place finisher Dartmouth.
The Big Green came out skiing hard, taking the first five spots in the Women’s 5k Classic on Friday. Harvard senior Audrey Mangan crossed the line in 12th place, followed by freshman Esther Kennedy. These were the highest finishes by the Crimson for the entire weekend. Dartmouth’s Nils Koons also took first in the Men’s 10k Classic, while Harvard’s top finisher was senior Trevor Petach at number 43.
University of Vermont also had a strong showing at the competition, finishing second overall and taking the top two spots in the Men’s Giant Slalom. Harvard senior Christopher Kinner came in 32nd place with a total time of 2:07:49, almost eight seconds behind first place. The Catamounts also took the top spot in the women’s version of the event, while the Crimson’s top finisher was junior Margie Thorp in 37th place with a time of 2:14:36.
The second day was more of the same for Harvard. Saturday’s events started off with the first run of the Men’s Slalom, where Crimson sophomore Kevin McNamara finished 34th, and he maintained that position after his second run with an overall time of 1:51:71. Freshman Kevin Sprague—who is also a Harvard cross-country runner—came in the 33rd spot in the Men’s 20k Freestyle Mass Start, an even won by the University of New Hampshire. The Women’s 15k Freestyle Mass Start saw Mangan come in 30th place. Mangan recorded a time of 52:33:0.
Saturday’s events ended with the second run of the Women’s Slalom. Dartmouth came in on top to solidify its victory overall, while Crimson freshman Catherine Sheils came in 21st place. Sheils ran both times in the 58-second range to finish with a combined time of 1:57:35.
“It was a matter of putting two runs together and we went out there, but we were not able to stay on our feet,” junior Brad Alvarez said. “Hopefully next week we can come out and stay on our feet so we can place a little higher.”

A few days ago, we reported that Harvard's latest attempt to entice prefrosh involves changing the name of the "April Visiting Program" to something more fun.
This weekend, we found out what our friends in New Haven have been working on: a lusciously filmed, perfectly choreographed admissions video that makes getting an education at Yale seem like just another a day at Disneyland.
Is this sun-drenched musical—which stars a multicultural cast of Yalies—a work of genius or a load of garbage? Does Harvard wither like a sad sack in comparison, or does Yale seem like it's trying way too hard? See for yourself. (You can even watch it in HD.)
Oh, and while you're at it, you may as well revisit Harvard's admissions video (and OHT's parody of it too). Enjoy.

While many lucky students are enjoying climates far from frozen Cambridge, the wintry weather is causing some trouble for the Lampoon.
This notice, which was spotted on the door of the Lampoon’s castle, announced that our favorite semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine is in violation of a city ordinance that requires property owners to remove snow and ice from their sidewalks promptly after a snowfall.
Our correspondent reported that, as of two days ago, snow still covered about half of the sidewalk around the building, leaving only a narrow walkway. (The sidewalk outside The Crimson, by the way, is fully cleared.)
According to the city's Web site, property owners are fined $50 for each day that their sidewalks remain uncleared. While we don’t know when the Lampoon was reported for the sidewalk violation, AccuWeather reports that the last snowfall of more than 0.1 inches in Cambridge occurred on Jan. 3, so the fine levied on the Lampoon may be quite hefty.
It was unclear whether any Lampoon members were on campus to clear the snow, and no one from the organization has returned our request for comments.
