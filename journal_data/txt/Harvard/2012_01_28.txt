There are many reasons why Emily Blunt and I are destined to become best friends. First, we both appreciate her delectable diet of starvation and cheese cubes in "The Devil Wears Prada." Second, we both enjoy a sassy British monarch—she, as Queen Victoria; I, as a fan from afar. And, what’s more, Blunt was recently spotted in a bar not far from my current haunt in Ann Arbor, Mich., belting out "Total Eclipse of the Heart," one of my favorite songs of all time.
I can already see our future together, grumpily nibbling at our celery and cheese cubes, pretending to be Helen Mirren as an eclipse blocks out the sun in the Great Lakes region.
I'm not usually one to fall naively in love with characters, but this winter I've found myself intrigued and surrounded by references to her latest film project, "The Five-Year Engagement." This is primarily because of the many hours I have spent in Zingerman's, Ann Arbor's favorite patisserie and one of the film's settings, whose selection of pastries, charcuterie, and cheeses is unrivaled.
On my first adventure to that magical gourmet land, I realized that I was walking in the footsteps of royalty. As I ordered my cabbage and goose fat strudel and my ham and cheese croissant, the staff behind the counter were raucously reliving the day Blunt shot a scene in the bakery. "She came over and started banging on the glass to get Jason Segel's attention because he was back in there," one of the employees said, gesticulating enthusiastically at the unsuspecting workers in white chef hats and aprons kneading large tabletops of dough. "That girl there in the purple, you can see her in the background in the movie!" she added with glee.
When I opened the newspaper the next evening, I saw that the movie crew had returned to Zingerman's after I had left. I was devastated. When again would I have the chance to profess my love for Jon and Amy's Double Dip with a garlic pickle and a lemonade on camera? When else could I stand in the background of a take and proudly recite, "I'm one stomach flu away from my goal weight!" I returned home and resigned myself to the truth that Blunt’s path will likely never cross with my own. But, in the meantime, I'll be prowling Ann Arbor's karaoke bars in the hopes of snagging a duet. I'll just tiptoe up behind her and croon, "Turn around, bright eyes."

The first apartment I visit is the one I end up taking, though of course I don't know that when I walk in. My life here is still bordered by the soft edges of illusion: it's concrete not yet hardened, waiting to dry. I go in and am not sure if I'm trying to fit the apartment into what I imagined or fit what I imagined into the apartment. What I imagined is hazy but there were wrought-iron balconies, engraved moldings, a view. Here there is a courtyard but not really a view. No moldings but the roommate is a philosophy student at the Sorbonne, his Plato lying half-opened on the couch. He plays the guitar and asks if I like Bob Dylan, hums some slightly off-key "Hurricane." We laugh nervously and I wonder what it would be like to live here.
I've never gotten to know a city this way. I duck in and out of metro stops, checking the maps, reaching a cross street and then often having to turn around, because you never really know where you are when you emerge from underground. The next apartment is owned by a 20-something Finnish girl, quiet and blond. The melancholy of the place pursues me out the door.
Another flat can only be reached through a code that won't work. I call to tell the owner and he texts me the same code. The door still won’t open. I stand outside in the gray and the wind pushes a flyer up against my shoe and it sticks there until I shake it off. I try once more, text once more, walk away quickly up the street without looking back. Ten minutes later he calls twice in a row. Both times I press ignore.
I don't know what I'm doing, really. At most of the apartments I forget to check the bathroom, or see if there's an oven, a washing machine. I'm asked if I have questions and wonder what they should be. I've never been very good with practicalities, and here it's harder, in the city of lights and love. Hemingway and Fitzgerald—that 1920s cohort—were hardly the only expat American writers to project onto the city their own ideal of it, so that even its stories that are real aren’t really.
I've never been here before so most of the stories are not mine. A friend tells of a proposal from a stranger at a late-night crêperie. My grandmother recalls a long-ago trip and an afternoon café where she and her husband were caught up in a mass of students protesting in the streets. There's no college football in Paris, said their expat friend and tour guide—this is what the students do instead. I walk across the Seine and these dialogues mix with stray lines from movies and books and the bridge creaks under their weight. I wonder what's there in the raw reality, once the dreams are scraped away, the layers peeled off. It’s a reality I realize I haven’t yet reached, even though an apartment awaits me, with a pony-tailed roommate and a classic rock chord.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Deans representing law schools in China, Brazil, Canada, and France gathered at Harvard Law School on Friday to discuss the pressures facing law schools to reform curricula in response to globalization.
The deans also focused on how the changing relationship between common and civil law will figure into the future of legal education.
According to Christophe Jamin, Dean of the Sciences Po Law School in France, there have been no official changes in the way law is taught in France. But certain trends have emerged in legal education—more students than ever before are pursuing double degrees at multiple European law schools and within their own university.
“The members of the bar seem to be very happy with the way we teach law in France,” Jamin said. “The pressure comes from in-house counsels [of corporations]. Globalization is very important for them...They want students to be able to speak with someone in China in the morning and with South Africa in the evening.”
A number of the deans said that they are concentrating on integrating common and civil law education—two areas of law that are historically distinct but are currently being reevaluated as law schools attempt to bring their curricula into the 21st century.
For example, Daniel Jutras, Dean of Law at McGill University, said that McGill has created a program to integrate civil and common law, but not as a response to the pressures of globalization. Rather, McGill recognized the need to reform its curriculum to reflect political and cultural transformations in Canada that were contributing to the decline of applications from Anglophone students.
McGill is a primarily English-speaking institution located within the French minority province of Quebec.
“This is really what any law school should do—define oneself and one’s program in ways that make sense internally, not in global positioning of laws schools,” Jutras said.
Jutras added that he has noticed that other schools are reforming curricula as a marketing device, a way to raise money, or to respond to pressures from segments of the Bar Association.
Harvard Law School Professor David B. Wilkins questioned whether one of the pressures to reform curricula is stemming from the Americanization of legal education and lawyering on a global scale.
Both Dean Joaquim Falcão of the Fundação Getúlio Vargas Law School in Brazil and Jamin rejected this idea.
Falcão said that large Brazilian law firms feel threatened by the prospect of American law firms expanding into Brazil.
“They will fight up to the last moment,” he said. “Blood, sweat, and tears.”
In France, Jamin has noticed that French law students are interested in international law—but not specifically American legal practice.
“They are fascinated by facilities, by earning money, but I know a lot of our students who spend four or five years in big law firms and then came back to more traditional, French law firms,” Jamin said. “It’s a very complex situation.”
A number of audience members asked the panel why one should go to law school when one can practice law in France or China without having taken the Bar exam or receiving a law degree.
Dean of Harvard Law School Martha L. Minow said that some states allow people to take the bar exam without a legal education, and that other states are exploring the possibility.
“It’s an interesting question,” she said. Law schools in America control “a certain kind of access to an elite profession.”
In the last several years HLS has implemented a series of reforms to its curriculum for the first time in 150 years, emphasizing problem-solving, experiential learning, and practicing law in global contexts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Harvard forward Louis Leblanc has now officially had his cup of coffee in the NHL, leaving a fairly strong impression with the Montreal Canadiens. In 14 games with the club, Leblanc registered five points (two goals, three assists), while also recording 16 shots, 17 hits, and playing an average of 9:45 per game. He scored his first goal on Dec. 15.
But on Jan. 4, Leblanc was sent back down to Montreal’s AHL affiliate, the Hamilton Bulldogs.  The decision to send him down was made even more difficult by Leblanc’s strong play in his first few games in the NHL, according to assistant coach Larry Carriere.
Leblanc was originally expected to have a short first stint in NHL, filling in originally for a suspended Max Pacioretty on an injury-ridden Canadien squad.
Former head coach Jacques Martin believed this to be the best option to help Leblanc progress, suggesting that the forward still has a lot to learn.
In his last two games before being assigned to Hamilton, Leblanc was a healthy scratch.
In his first stint with the Bulldogs, Leblanc had scored four goals and recorded six assists in 14 games. Since then, he has recorded six overall points, with five goals and one assist in nine more games in the AHL.
Leblanc shined in a two-goal performance on Jan. 13 against the Adirondack Phantoms, netting back-to-back scores in a 5-4 loss.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW HAVEN, Conn.—It was supposed to be the Ivy League’s premier men’s basketball matchup—two teams picked to finish first and second in the conference’s preseason poll squaring off in front of a packed house.
But round one of this year’s Harvard-Yale series failed to live up to the hype, as the Crimson (18-2, 4-0 Ivy) pummeled the Bulldogs on their home floor, winning 65-35, at John J. Lee Amphitheater Friday night.
Harvard stifled Yale’s offense, holding the Bulldogs (13-5, 3-1) to 27 points below their previous season low on 32 percent shooting.
“It’s embarrassing,” said Yale senior Greg Mangano, whose team committed 22 turnovers. “We came out, and we got embarrassed on our home court. You’re supposed to try to win every game here and protect your court, and we didn’t do that tonight.”
Mangano led the Bulldogs with 17 points—just 2.4 below his season average—but no other Yale player posted more than four points on the night.
“I don’t think we ran very good offense the entire game,” Yale coach James Jones said. “We never really got into a rhythm offensively all night.”
Yale sophomore Austin Morgan, the Bulldogs’ second-leading scorer, entered Friday’s contest averaging 13.1 points per game but was shut down by co-captain Oliver McNally, finishing with three points on one of three shooting.
“Morgan has always been a thorn in our side,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “Morgan is a tough kid to guard because he moves so well and they screen for him, but McNally was outstanding tonight. I thought he was very disciplined. He didn’t bail him out with silly fouls.”
Bulldogs captain and third-leading scorer Reggie Willhite had his worst performance of the season, turning the ball over a game-high six times while scoring just three points.
“There were several turnovers where I still don’t know how we lost the ball—just fumbled it out of our hands with no pressure at all,” Jones said. “The guys that were wearing the jerseys, I’m not sure who we were tonight. Those weren’t the guys that I’ve seen in practice and all season long.”
Sophomore Laurent Rivard, starting in just his fourth game this season, led the Crimson offensively with 18 points, shooting five of eight from the field and two of five from deep.
Coming off the bench, Harvard freshman Steve Moundou-Missi chipped in with 10 points, eight of which came in the first half.
Moundou-Missi wasn’t the only Crimson player making an impact off the bench, as Harvard’s second unit combined for 15 of the Crimson’s 30 first-half points.
After both teams got off to slow starts offensively—the two combined for 15 total points through the first seven minutes of play—Harvard’s bench took control of the game for the Crimson.
Jesse Pritchard’s three-pointer with 10:46 to play gave Yale its first—and only—lead of the game, but Moundou-Missi answered, sticking a mid-range jumper from the right baseline.
Willhite tried to advance the ball back up the court, but Moudou-Missi picked the senior’s pocket on the perimeter and took it the other way, capping off the play with a transition dunk to put the Crimson up by three.
The scene repeated itself less than three minutes later. This time, Moundou-Missi picked off a Morgan pass and took it to the house for another slam.
“We knew that we had a gem in this particular young man,” said Amaker of Moundou-Missi. “I think he’s embraced his role thus far with being a guy that’s doing dirty work.”
McNally made it a three-possession game moments later, sticking a three-point shot to put the Crimson up by seven. Harvard got seven more points from its bench before the end of the half, taking a 30-19 lead into the break.
It only got uglier for Yale in the second half, as Harvard started to click offensively—shooting 52.2 percent from the field in the frame—while the Bulldogs continued to struggle, scoring only 16 points in the second half.
“I thought we had great ball movement,” Amaker said. “That’s one of the calling cards of our offense. We really move it, and kids get touches and we change sides of the floor.”
Harvard went up by 19 just over six minutes into the second period, and its lead never dipped below 18 the rest of the way. With 4:04 to play, junior Christian Webster put the Crimson ahead by 30 with a pair of free throws, and Harvard cruised to its largest over the Bulldogs in the 183-game history of the overall.
“I’m certainly pleased with a great effort by our entire team,” Amaker said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After less than five minutes of play in the first period of Friday night’s matchup, the No. 8/9 Harvard women’s hockey team had already amassed a two-goal lead over rival Yale at Ingalls Rink in New Haven, Conn. And the Crimson didn’t stop there, netting six more goals over the course of the game to earn its second straight ECAC victory, 8-0.
“It was great that we were able to get on the board early,” junior forward Jillian Dempsey said. “We said before the game that we wanted to score early and often, and we were able to do a little bit of both.”
Dempsey started the Harvard (13-6-1, 10-4-1 ECAC) scoring onslaught with a goal 3:40 into the contest. Less than a minute later, classmate Kaitlin Spurling followed suit, putting away her first of two goals in the frame to lead Harvard in its most fruitful offensive effort of the year.
“Our three lines are pretty well balanced, and everyone has a knack for finding everyone else on their line,” Spurling said. “We were able to use our small [numbers] and our team’s chemistry to our advantage on the ice.”
Spurling converted her second goal of the period at 14:12, sending the Crimson into the break with a commanding lead. Sophomore forward Kalley Armstrong and rookie forward Hillary Crowe were credited with assists on the play.
After the three-goal opening frame, Harvard continued to dominate, outshooting the Bulldogs (1-21, 1-14), 46-9, on the night. Seven players—including a balanced spread of two freshmen, three sophomores, and two juniors—contributed at least a goal for the Crimson.
“Obviously we have such a small team in numbers, with only 18, but for us that’s an advantage,” Dempsey said. “Everyone is able to contribute and play, so we all know we need to be ready to go any given night. Everyone works so hard, and when people get chances, they bury it. We’re lucky to have such great depth.”
In the second period, Harvard scored quickly once again, with sophomore forward Gina McDonald converting the tally for the Crimson 2:50 in. Freshman forward Sami Reber pushed Harvard’s lead to five with a score of her own shortly before the 10-minute mark in the middle frame.
The Crimson put away three more goals in the final period, with sophomore forwards Kalley Armstrong and Elizabeth Parker and freshman forward Hillary Crowe collectively netting three goals in a span of just over seven minutes.
Armstrong boosted Harvard’s already-large advantage to six, with a goal in the 12th minute of play, and Crowe found the back of the net just 2:32 later.
Parker closed out the scoring for the Crimson at 17:19.
“We take every game one step at a time,” Spurling said. “We came into this weekend saying that ‘we want four points, we want four points.’ We went in and did the job.”
Despite letting the puck slip through eight times, the Bulldogs’ goaltending duo of Jaimie Leonoff and Genny Ladiges combined for 38 saves on the night.
The Harvard defense looked strong against Yale, forcing junior goaltender Laura Bellamy to make just nine saves on the way to her second straight shutout, with the other win coming in the Crimson’s recent contest against Colgate at Bright Hockey Center. Last night’s victory marked the junior assistant captain’s fifth clean sheet of the season.
“Something [Harvard coach Katey Stone] told us before the game [is] we have to be good defensively if we want to be good offensively,” Spurling said. “That really translated [Friday night].”
“We challenged ourselves about halfway through the game,” Dempsey added. “We thought we were doing a great job with pressure and wanted to limit Yale to only 10 shots.… We were happy to come out, start strong, and continue to be strong the whole game.”
Although the outcome of the traditional rivalry matchup of Harvard and Yale was a bit lopsided this year, Dempsey stressed that she and her Crimson teammates view every game as important.
“We seem like we have a rivalry with everybody,” Dempsey said. “And Harvard-Yale is just another big game for us. We didn’t really think about that too much going into the game. We always say that the next game is always the biggest game. The rivalry didn’t really seem to factor in too much.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team looked on the verge of extending a rather unenviable program record Friday night. With a Harvard-high eight ties already in the books in the 2011-12 season, number nine appeared imminent.
But after blowing a 3-2 lead with just four minutes left, the Crimson responded against Yale. Senior forward Alex Killorn’s goal with just over a minute left sealed the 4-3 Harvard (5-6-8, 4-5-6 ECAC) victory over the Bulldogs (8-10-2, 5-7-1) at a packed Bright Hockey Center.
“Our guys battled.... It was nice to have somebody step up and make the play,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “Losing the lead there in the third was a little bit frustrating and disappointing, but our guys have played in a lot of close games, so we were able to bounce back.”
The game-winner was the second goal of the night for Killorn, whose first goal early in the second period tied both teams at two.
Junior forward Marshall Everson scored one goal and dished out an assist on the night, tying him with Killorn for a team-high two points. Both of Everson’s points came in the final frame.
“[Everson] made a great play on the third goal...[and] a nice pass on the game-winning goal,” Donato said. “Marshall’s really having a breakout year, and we expect him, as his confidence grows, to keep improving and be a major factor for us.
Between the pipes, freshman goaltender Steve Michalek struggled in the early going, letting in two goals on just 10 shots in the first period. But the rookie settled down, stopping 23 Yale shots while allowing just one to get by him in the final 40 minutes.
The contest had special meaning for Michalek, a Glastonbury, Conn. native.
“I know Yale’s been kind of a powerhouse the past few years, and especially being in Connecticut while they were doing so well, I’ve been looking forward to this game for a while,” Michalek said. “It’s great to win it.”
The victory was the first for the Crimson since a Dec. 10 contest at Princeton, which Harvard won, 4-3. In the ensuing eight games, the Crimson had tied five and lost three.
In its nationally televised 234th meeting with Yale, Harvard struck first. Just under four minutes in, senior forward Eric Kroshus skated towards the right side of the Bulldog goal before crossing the puck to junior forward Luke Grenier, who easily deposited the puck past Yale netminder Jeff Malcolm.
The Bulldogs responded emphatically at the end of the period, scoring twice in a period of 13 seconds to give the visitors the lead.
“That’s kind of been a problem for us all year is we let up a goal and then we kind of sit back and let up another one quickly,” Michalek said.
Killorn brought the Crimson even with the visitors at the beginning of the subsequent frame when he skated around the goal and managed to tuck the puck inside the left post on a wraparound.
Harvard didn’t find the back of the net for the remainder of the frame, though it had its chances.
A slashing penalty against Bulldog Jesse Root at the 2:19 mark gave the Crimson its first power play of the evening. Despite consistent pressure and a flurry of shots, Harvard, which has the top-ranked power play in the nation, failed to convert.
The team’s power play looked flat for the rest of the period.
“We just got away from what we were doing with our breakouts,” Killorn said. “I think guys were getting a little frustrated, trying to force things a little bit on the breakout.”
The Crimson had another opportunity with just over two minutes left in the period. With the puck in Yale’s defensive zone, Donato took Michalek out of goal to redouble Harvard’s pressure. But that tactic didn’t work either, and the buzzer sounded on the second period with both teams still knotted at two.
The Crimson power play clicked in the final period, and Everson broke the stalemate with a timely goal on the man advantage midway through the third frame. Harvard now has scored a power-play goal in 18 of its last 19 matchups.
Yale responded six minutes later, as Bulldogs sophomore Gus Young scored an unassisted goal to even the sides at three. But Killorn’s score later in the period would send the visitors back to New Haven with the loss.

For the second time in as many games, the Harvard women’s basketball team found itself down three in the final moments on Friday night. And once again, the Crimson couldn’t come through, falling to Yale, 68-63, at Lavietes Pavilion.
With 17 seconds remaining, Bulldog junior Megan Vasquez failed to push the visitors’ lead to four as she missed the back half of a one-and-one. Crimson junior Miriam Rutzen came down with the board and pushed the ball forward to co-captain Brogan Berry, whose miss on a heavily contested shot from under the basket sealed Harvard’s third straight loss to its archrival.
“I’m really disappointed,” Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said after the game. “It was the kind of game we thought it was going to be. Our defensive breakdowns were horrible, and it was pretty deep through the team. It was inexplicable.”
Sophomore Christine Clark led Harvard (8-8, 1-1 Ivy) with 16 points, while junior Victoria Lippert contributed 15. Rutzen scored eight and brought down 11 rebounds.
But the balanced attack was ultimately not enough to overcome an equally distributed scoring night for Yale (10-7, 2-1). Three Bulldogs—Vasquez, freshman Sarah Halejian, and sophomore Janna Graf—finished in double figures and combined for seven three-pointers on the night, as the team shot 43 percent from behind the arc.
“They have great three-point shooters,” Delaney-Smith said. “You can’t go trying for steals and lunging for the ball. That’s what we were doing.”
The Crimson got off to a fast 8-0 start, but Yale rallied to take a 16-15 lead. By the end of the first half, Harvard had a five-point edge thanks to 10 points from Lippert and six from Clark.
“Our adrenaline was going; our defense was tough,” Berry said. “We had been waiting for our home opener for Ivies for a while. I wish we just could have had the same intensity from the first couple minutes of the game to the second half.”
The Bulldogs flipped the script as soon as the second half began. Four players knocked down shots from inside and out, fueling a 14-2 run that ended with the visitors leading, 38-31.
“You get in the flow of the game, and you don’t stay focused,” Berry said. “It took us too long to recognize it, and it’s something we need to be able to adjust to. When a team’s making a run, we need to work on making it stop sooner.”
Harvard’s lack of intensity also showed on the boards. Yale came down with 10 possession-saving offensive rebounds in the second period of action that proved pivotal in a hard-fought contest.
During the final 15 minutes of the game, neither team had a lead greater than six, though the Crimson only led once in the last 10 minutes.
Following a miss on the Bulldogs’ end, Berry brought the ball up the court down just one point. After passing the ball around, it ended up back in the co-captain’s hand. With 30 seconds left, Berry put up a jumper that clanged out.
Yale pulled down the rebound and furiously pushed it up court. Halejian ended up with the ball and drove in for an uncontested layup. As Halejian went up, Harvard junior Emma Golen pushed her in the back, setting up an opportunity for a three-point play. The freshman stepped to the line and immediately executed, running the Bulldogs’ lead to four and making it a two-possession game.
While Golen quickly redeemed herself by making a 15-footer six seconds later, it wasn’t enough. Vasquez made the first of a one-an-one after an intentional foul, and Berry was unable to respond on the following possession. Two more Vasquez free throws sealed the game for Yale.
The close loss came on the heels of a similar defeat to North Dakota 10 days prior. In that contest, Clark controlled the ball down three with 15 seconds remaining. She opted to take a three in transition that came up short. Harvard went on to lose, 60-57.
“It’s a very disappointing loss,” Berry said. “We had been preparing for 10 days. We knew exactly what we had to do, but we didn’t put 40 minutes of defensive effort in. It was lost in the first seven minutes of the second half, and we never got in a rhythm after that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
2011 was a big year in Harvard athletics. Women’s soccer captured  its third Ivy League championship in four years. The men’s basketball  team took home a share of the Ancient Eight title and entered the  nation’s Top 25, both firsts in program history. Football set a  modern-era program record for points in a season, scoring 374 points en  route to a 9-1 finish and a league crown. Four other teams—men’s  fencing, men’s heavyweight and lightweight crew, and softball—also  finished 2011 on top of the Ivy League standings.
There were a number of standout individual performances as well.  Women’s fencer Alexandra Kiefer captured the NCAA Foil Individual title.  Men’s basketball forward Keith Wright became just the second player in  Harvard history to take home Ivy League Player of the Year honors.  Women’s soccer and lacrosse captain Melanie Baskind was named to the  First Team All-Ivy in two different sports and was selected as the Ivy  League Player of the Year in soccer.
We at The Back Page have taken on the tall task of determining the  best Harvard athlete of 2011. Here’s how it will go down: we’ve  selected 16 standout Harvard athletes—eight male and eight female—and  set up two single elimination brackets. Each round, Harvard’s finest  will square off in head-to-head matchups. And based on their  performances in 2011, we will determine who advances and who is  eliminated until just one male and one female remain. Then, the two  champs will square off to determine the top Harvard athlete of 2011.
After taking a look at half of the first-round matchups on the women's side, we now examine two more faceoffs between Harvard's top female athletes: squash's Laura Gemmell v. skiing's Rebecca Nadler and fencing's Alexandra Kiefer v. hockey's Josephine Pucci.
Check back soon to find out the rest winners on the women's side of the bracket.
Laura Gemmell v. Rebecca Nadler
This pair of Canadians came by success in very different environments. On the slopes, Nadler made history by becoming her team’s first NCAA championship qualifier. Nadler, who went on to take 20th in the slalom, and her teammate Sheils represented Harvard, one of only two Ivy schools to qualify racers.
Nadler also raced for Team Canada at the World University Games.
Gemmell, for much of last season and the year before, was the No. 1 seed on a No. 1 women’s squash team prided for its excellence. But in 2011, neither Gemmell nor her squad could repeat the success from 2010. The Crimson fell to Yale in the CSA National Championship, and Gemmell lost her first collegiate match to the Bulldogs' Millie Tomlinson in the finals of the CSA Individual National Championship.
But Gemmell still dominated the competition, posting a 16-1 record in her sophomore campaign. So far this season, though she's now playing at the No. 2 spot, Gemmell is perfect.
In the end, Nadler made program history while Gemmell couldn't repeat her performance from the previous year. The nod goes to the skiier.
Winner: Rebecca Nadler
Alexandra Kiefer v. Josephine Pucci
Sophomore foil Alexandra Kiefer and junior defender Josephine Pucci can both use their weapons with remarkable dexterity and ingenuity to dominate their respective opponents.
Pucci’s weapon, her stick, is responsible for 25 points in the form of 12 goals and 13 assists in 30 games during the 2010-11 season. In addition to leading all defenders in points, her +24 doubled Harvard’s next best skater’s +/-.
Alexandra Kiefer also found a degree of success that was unmatched by her teammates. Her 78.3 winning percentage as a freshman at the NCAA Fencing Championship led not only Harvard but all fencers in the foil. Kiefer went on to become the only Ivy fencer to win an individual gold medal.
Kiefer’s standout individual performance and Pucci’s goalless December combine to give Kiefer the advantage in this one.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PROVIDENCE, R.I.—In last season’s two games against Brown, the Harvard men’s basketball team needed a pair of dramatic second-half rallies to avoid being upset by the Bears.
But in the teams’ first matchup of 2012, no such comeback was necessary, as No. 23 Harvard never trailed on the way to an easy 68-59 victory at the Pizzitola Sports Center.
Junior forward Kyle Casey led the Crimson (18-2, 4-0 Ivy) with 20 points on 9-of-15 shooting and also contributed eight rebounds. Co-captain forward Keith Wright paced Harvard with 11 boards on a night when Harvard outrebounded Brown, 39-25.
“We played really, really hard,” Brown coach Jesse Agel said. “Obviously we would have wanted a different outcome, but you can only play as hard as you can and let the chips fall where they may.”
The Bears (7-14, 1-3) never got closer than eight in the final 18 minutes, as the Crimson consistently hit big shots to halt any Brown attempts at a run.
After a Dockery Walker offensive rebound and put-back floater cut the Bears’ deficit to 47-39 at the midway point of the second half, Casey responded with a long jumper from the left corner and a transition dunk to push the Crimson’s lead to 12.
“I think it was a pretty solid game by me, but [junior point guard] Brandyn [Curry] and our guards just found me off penetration, and I just happened to hit my shots tonight,” Casey said.
After two Sean McGonagill free throws cut Brown’s deficit to 10, Harvard responded with a 5-0 run. Freshman forward Steve Mondou-Missi followed a Casey miss with a put-back layup, and Curry—who finished with 15—completed an acrobatic and-one layup to make it 56-41.
The teams went back and forth for the final seven minutes with Harvard unable to get a lead larger than 15 and Brown unable to get closer than 11 until a McGonagill three with 18 seconds remaining.
Mondou-Missi—who finished with 10 rebounds in 19 minutes—continued to provide energy down the stretch, just as he did Friday night against the Bulldogs. The rookie had an emphatic dunk off an Oliver McNally missed three to make it 60-45, then threw down a long alley-oop pass from McNally for Harvard’s next score.
“Steve was sensational tonight,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “His play was terrific, absolutely terrific.”
But by that point, the game was far out of reach, and the Crimson completed a dominant road sweep of Yale and Brown after struggling on the same trip last season.
“I think we’re a team on a mission this year,” Casey said. “We have our goals and our standards that we want to hold ourselves accountable to and achieve. We got down early, [but] being a veteran team, I think we learned from those experiences and tried to nip them in the bud and not make the same mistake twice.”
Early on, Harvard looked poised for a blowout, jumping out to a quick 15-5 lead.
Curry started the scoring with a three from the top of the key. McNally followed with a transition layup off a Brown turnover, and Casey put the Crimson up 7-0 by beating his man baseline. The lead soon expanded to 11-3 on a Casey jumper over Andrew McCarthy.
But the Bears fought back from there, putting together a 12-2 run capped by a Stephen Albrecht three to cut the Harvard lead to 17-15.
“They played exceptionally hard,” Amaker said. “We got off to a great start and made some shots, and then it was a dogfight like it always is against Brown.”
Casey went to work again later, with a layup and another jumper over McCarthy to make it 26-20. But Brown hung tough for the rest of the half, not allowing Harvard’s lead to get larger than seven. The Bears got as close as two on a McCarthy layup with 42 seconds left in the first, and a pair of subsequent Curry free throws made it 31-27 going into the break.
All five Brown starters finished in double figures, but its reserves were outscored 14-0 by the Crimson’s.
“Our bench and our balance have been the keys for our team,” Amaker said.
That statistic, combined with Brown’s 11-20 mark from the free throw line, allowed the Crimson to cruise to a victory over a team that led Harvard at halftime by 21 and 11 points in its two meetings last season.
“Our goal this weekend was to come here and get two wins,” Casey said. “So we came down here and did what we set out to do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the second time in as many nights, the Harvard men’s hockey team appeared on the brink of losing or tying well into the third period.
But once again, the Crimson managed to secure the victory in dramatic fashion. And on Saturday’s contest against Brown, it was once again senior forward Alex Killorn whose goal pushed Harvard over the top.
The previous night against Yale, Killorn had broken a 3-3 deadlock with just over a minute left.
Down one to Brown at the start of the final period, the Crimson rallied, and Killorn’s score with 7:42 left on the clock in the third period put Harvard ahead, 2-1. A final goal late in the frame after Brown had pulled its goalie gave the Crimson the 3-1 victory at Bright Hockey Center.
“I don’t think it was our most energized effort for 60 minutes,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I thought our guys came out and responded well in the third period. Once we got on the scoreboard, I thought we found our legs and found a little bit of energy.”
The win over the Bears (5-7-2, 8-10-3 ECAC)—coupled with Friday’s victory against the Bulldogs—moves Harvard (5-4-6, 6-6-8) into sole possession of fourth place in the ECAC standings.
Harvard’s offense on Saturday night struggled before the flurry of third-period goals, managing just one shot in the opening 12 minutes and 10 in the first two periods. Though Brown held the edge offensively in the opening frame, doubling Harvard’s shot total, neither team could pull ahead.
The Crimson didn’t do much better in the subsequent period, and though Brown scored, neither team held the clear edge.
“First 40 minutes was a weird game. It was almost like we were playing ping-pong out there,” Killorn said.
But Harvard’s offensive futility came to a sharp halt in the final frame, when three goals in 20 minutes sealed the Harvard win.
Senior forward Eric Kroshus led the Crimson in scoring on Saturday, assisting on Killorn’s goal and finding the back of the net himself at the start of the third period to tie both teams at one.
“He’s been huge for us as of late,” Killorn said of Kroshus. “Not even on his goals and assists, but all game. He played hard, he got the puck in deep, he was doing everything to spark our team. And once he got that goal, it really did change the game.”
Junior defenseman Danny Biega scored the third and final Crimson goal when his long shot down the ice found an empty Bears net.
But none of the Harvard scores came on its vaunted power play. For just the second time in 20 contests, Harvard failed to score at least once with a man advantage.
Freshman goaltender Steve Michalek anchored a strong Crimson defensive effort, as the rookie stopped 24 of the 25 shots that came his away, good for a .960 save percentage.
After the scoreless first period, both attacks loosened up with the opening of the middle frame, but it was the Bears who struck first. Just 3:34 in, Brown forward Francis Drolet skated behind the Harvard goal to Michalek’s left. The junior then crossed the puck inside to Jarred Smith, who drilled a one-timer past Michalek to give the visitors the lead.
Six minutes later, Harvard picked up its first power play of the night after Richie Crowley earned a roughing call when he blindsided Killorn. But the Crimson couldn’t seize the man advantage, failing to register a shot on goal in the two minutes.
The Crimson came back onto the ice for the final period reinvigorated and rapidly evened the score at one apiece.
“We were a little sluggish in the first two periods,” Kroshus said. “[Donato] came in and said, ‘We’re down one, we played pretty badly for 40 minutes, but we can make up for it with 20 minutes.’ So there wasn’t much to say before. We came out and gave it our all.”
Just over four minutes into the period, junior forward David Valek skated down the left side of the ice before circling behind the Bears goal. In anticipation of a wraparound attempt, Clemente shifted to his right, and Valek weaved the puck through two Brown defenders to Kroshus. With a good look on goal, Kroshus nailed the equalizer.
Killorn gave Harvard the lead seven minutes later. After taking the pass near the left faceoff circle, Killorn skated to his left before firing a shot that clanged off the post and into the net.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off an 8-0 clobbering of Yale, the No. 8/9 Harvard women’s hockey team continued to find the back of the net against Brown, cruising to a 3-0 victory Saturday afternoon at Meehan Auditorium in Providence, R.I.
“The team played well as a unit this weekend,” junior forward Jillian Dempsey wrote in an email. “There were some really beautiful goals set up by finesse passing. It is a testament to this team’s hustle and hard work that between both games so many different players made it onto the box score with goals and assists.”
It did not take long for Harvard (14-6-1, 11-4-1 ECAC) to take control of this one. Eight minutes in, sophomore forward Gina McDonald fired a shot that clanged off the post, but the near-goal didn’t faze the Crimson. The stretch that ensued included goals scored by junior forward Kaitlin Spurling at 11:19 from sophomore forward Kalley Armstrong and freshman defender Sarah Edney at 12:09.
“It’s really important to come out right off the bat and get the momentum on your side,” junior defender Josephine Pucci said. We’ve used our speed in the first period and that has caught teams a little off guard. Hopefully, we will continue doing that for the games we have coming up this week.”
With her first-period goal, Edney became the eighth and final Harvard player to score this weekend.
The Bears (7-9-7, 4-8-4) responded with one of their most threatening possessions all night, firing five in the direction of the net and forcing three saves. While the Crimson held the 12-8 advantage in shots on goal by the end of the first, Brown edged Harvard 5-4 in the category after the two goals.
But as would be the case all night, junior goaltender Laura Bellamy proved to be unbeatable, as she sailed to her third consecutive shutout and fourth in her last six games.
The second period started much as the first ended, as both teams fired strings of shots but neither was able to find the back of the net. Following two early Bellamy saves, the Crimson struck with consecutive shots from Spurling followed by attempts from freshman forward Hillary Crowe and freshman forward Samantha Reber.
Harvard proceeded to block four of the Bears’ next seven attempts before Spurling added the exclamation point to a fruitful weekend.
After notching two goals and two assists against the Bulldogs, Spurling added the game’s final score midway through the second to give Harvard the commanding three-goal advantage. A blocked shot off of Pucci’s stick helped set up the score.
The breakdown of shots on goal in the second period was a similar 13-8 in favor of the Crimson.
Brown’s prospects continued to fade in the final period. After failing to attempt one shot on net with a man advantage early in the frame, the Bears managed only managing two shots in the contest’s closing 20 minutes.
Bellamy stopped all 18 shots that got to her on the night. The defense also did its part, keeping the puck out of danger by blocking a combined 11 shots.
“It’s a whole team effort,” Pucci said. “As a defensive unit, we’ve really made it [a priority] to try and eliminate shots as much as possible, and obviously [Bellamy] has been making the saves that she should make and some big saves too. Also, our forwards have done a great job generating back pressure, making it easy for the defensemen to step up and take away the shooting lanes.”
Over Bellamy’s perfect three-game span, Harvard has scored 15 goals and allowed just 47 shots on net.
But Bellamy and her teammates will be tested in the first round of the Beanpot against Boston University on Tuesday night. On the other side of the four-team draw are No. 4 Boston College and No. 6 Northeastern.
“Against Brown we only gave them outside looks at the net and forced tough angle shots,” Dempsey said. “Overall, we were proud of the effort and results this weekend and will continue to build upon the good and the bad as we head into the Beanpot Tuesday night.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s volleyball team cruised to its second straight shutout win on Saturday, defeating Springfield, 3-0, in its home opener Saturday night at the Malkin Athletic Center.
Leading for most of the contest, the Crimson (3-0) withstood a late charge by the Pride (2-4) in the first set and never looked back, handily earning the victory over a Springfield squad that had recently shut out Endicott.
After falling behind 24-14, the Pride went on an 8-0 run to pull within two. But Harvard co-captain Matt Jones stepped up and put Springfield away, spiking the ball past the Pride defense to clinch the opening set.
“Matt Jones did a fantastic job tonight,” Harvard coach Brain Baise said. “We got the ball to him, and he finished the game for us. From there, we got more momentum and we kept it up.”
Jones led the team in kills with 16 on the night, hitting at a .682 clip en route to the Crimson’s third straight win to start to the season.
With a good mix of upper and underclassmen, the team has been clicking so far, riding a strong all-around performance while snapping Springfield’s two-game winning streak.
“We’ve all meshed together and found our roles,” said freshman Caleb Zimmick, who led the team with five blocks. “It’s all been working. Everybody’s opening up opportunities for everyone else and working well as a team.”
In the opening set, Harvard and Springfield played it close until the Crimson was able to pull ahead, grabbing a 12-6 lead after five straight points. Harvard kept the steady edge, riding a 6-0 streak to reach set point before the Pride’s comeback attempt.
When Springfield finally clipped the lead to two, Baise called a timeout so that the Crimson could regroup.
“We were making mistakes,” Baise said. “They kept their serves in, [and] we just had a terrible string of errors.”
But Harvard was able to come back from the timeout and immediately send it to the second set.
“When the timeout was called, we just took a second [and] took a breather,” Zimmick said. “We had to be confidant knowing we had the victory at hand.”
The second set was a little closer throughout, with the Crimson holding on to a slim lead for most of the frame. The Pride was able to get within one point at 13-12, led by John Coen’s team-leading eight kills.
Harvard then pulled ahead with a 6-1 run, running the score to 19-13 before the visitors utilized a pair of consecutive aces to claw within to within two, 19-17.
But the Crimson was able to shut the door. Playing off its strong defensive strategy, Harvard ripped off 6-2 run to seal the second set.
“We focused on blocking and defense,” Zimmick said. “We just wanted to get out to all of our blocks and close them and play really fundamentally sound defense and stay home.”
The third and final set was more of a back-and-forth affair, with Harvard initially breaking out to a 10-6 lead after a 4-4 tie.
But Springfield battled back, taking its latest lead of the night at 14-13 on the heels of an 8-3 run. Pride setter Mike Becker, who had 23 assists and three aces against the Crimson, played a key role in the lead reversal.
That was the closest the Pride would get, as Harvard immediately took back the lead and went on a game-closing 12-5 run.
Springfield threatened late, but with the score at 20-19, freshman DJ White had two straight kills, initiating a 5-0 spurt that ended the match.
The Crimson was able to sweep the Pride with its balanced attack of defense and offense, stemming from its consistent service game.
“I’m real pleased with the way we played,” Baise said. “We were sharp in just about every area. We were working on particularly playing with patience and making good decisions; we did all that tonight. Our service team was pretty good so we would tap the ball well which would allow us to settle.”
Freshmen Zimmick and White continued to provide a spark for Harvard, contributing seven and eight kills, respectively.
Sophomore Nick Madden was second on the team with 11 kills, while junior setter Rob Lothman had a solid game as well, tallying a team-leading 22 assists and six digs.
Though still early in the season, Harvard has looked tough so far in 2012, rebounding sharply from last year’s disappointing conclusion.
“We’ve got a long way to go,“ Baise said. “But to play that consistently with that balanced a game this early, it feels real good.”

Harvard Square was packed this afternoon with a multitude of chocolate lovers mulling about and sampling desserts from Cambridge businesses such as J.P. Licks and Bertucci's Italian Restaurant. A few hundred individuals also participated in the Harvard Square Treasure Hunt, which took treasure-seekers to Harvard Square stores to answer questions such as "What band and candy, made in Cambridge, share the same name?"
The reason? The Harvard Square Business Association is sponsoring the second annual Chocolate Festival, which began last night with an event titled "Dining in the Dark" at Nubar. The festival continues through the end of Sunday. Approximately 12-15 businesses are participating, offering chocolate-themed meals, hosting chocolate tastings, and selling discounted chocolate products.
If the appeal of chocolate isn't enough, festival-goers can feel good about indulging, as the proceeds generated by sales will be donated to the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter.
"Every single one of them is getting a kiss," said event organizer Matt R. Frank. He gazed out at festival attendees from across the Square, holding out a bag of Hershey's chocolate to passersby.
While all of the weekend's prix fixe chocolate dining experiences are sold out, there are still spots available on the Chocolate Tour tomorrow, a delicious event you definitely don't want to miss!
