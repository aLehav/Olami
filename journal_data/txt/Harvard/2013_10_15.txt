After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Welcome to The Arts Blog's new weekly column "Televisionary" by Joey R. Longstreet, where he discusses television events with his own unique perspective.
I was not one of the roughly 17.6 million people who watched The 65th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards the evening of September 22. After coming home late at night, I logged onto Tivli and devoured the penultimate episode of “Breaking Bad” (which was not as amazing as the episode before it, but then again no TV episode ever will be). As soon as I was done, I took a quick glance at the Emmy results. I fully intended to watch the ceremony, but I never got around to it, folks. And it’s a good thing I didn't because the Emmy results this year were puzzling to say the least and earth-shatteringly terrible to say the most. I’m one of the rare breed who puts far too much stock in these award shows and so, after last month's ceremony, I’ve concluded that the Emmys hate me. And here’s why:
-The nominations themselves were already horrendous. Barely any “Parks & Recreation” love, far too much “Big Bang Theory”, and the “Wicked” of TV shows, “Modern Family,” getting too many (to clarify: an item of pop culture that is inexplicably loved despite being horrible). Things were far better in Dramaland, though the continual inclusion of “Downton Abbey” confounds me.
-Did anyone else feel like NPH was phoning it in a bit this time around? I think he’s even sick of him hosting award shows at this point. #tinaandamy2014emmys
-Right off the bat, my hopes and dreams for the future were destroyed when Jane Krakowski—my inspiration, my spirit animal, my chief creative inspiration–was robbed of the E of her EGOT by none other than Merrit Weaver of “Nurse Jackie.” Nurse Jackie. You’re probably wondering, “What is 'Nurse Jackie?'” So is America. I was also quite put off by her speech, as I can only imagine Jane would’ve given a ravishing performance of “As If We’ve Never Said Goodbye” from Sunset Boulevard as her speech and then won an Emmy next year! Although at least Julie Bowen and her arms didn’t win again.
-I have very mixed feelings in the Lead Actress Comedy category. On the one hand, Julia Louis-Dreyfus makes my cynical dreams come true in "Veep," whilst Tina is forever the love of my life as Liz Lemon and Amy is perfection as Leslie Knope.
-Jim Parsons winning Best Leading Actor in a Comedy. Jim Parsons?! Is this real life?! His show has a laugh track. Unforgivable. That was Louis C.K.’s Emmy.
-Lead Actor in a Drama. Jeff Daniels, where did you even come from? I sincerely thought this was Jon Hamm’s year—his work on the fifth season of "Mad Men" was stellar (remember the look between him and Sally at the end?! Now I’m crying again) and, in my opinion, was more deserving than Cranston’s work in the first half of Season 5. Also, Cranston’s already won before. Daniels, while being a bright spot on an atrocious television show (sorry to break it to you, but “The Newsroom” is awful) didn’t deserve that Emmy and I think his speech reflected that even he knew that. No matter, BCranst will take it next year and then it’ll finally be Hamm’s time.
-I don’t want to go on a rant about “Modern Family,” but I will. It’s an awful television show and shouldn’t even be nominated for Emmys, let alone win them. The show, passable in its first season, has seen a severe decline in quality, something that everyone but the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences has realized. My guess is that it’s right in the sweet spot of being edgier than "The Big Bang Theory" (snooze) but being not nearly as edgy (or funny, or good, or groundbreaking) as "30 Rock," "Veep," "Louie," or "Girls" (or "Parks & Rec!") It’s a safe choice and so it wins. Tina knows in her heart that "30 Rock" should’ve won. That’s all that matters.
-I forgot—no “Smash” nominations?! R.I.P. Ivy Lynn, you’ll always be my star.
-There were only three Emmy wins that I 100% agreed with this year. The first is “Veeps”’s Tony Hale’s win for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy. He’s hysterical and now he can say “These are my awards, mother. From Emmy." The second is Anna Gunn’s for “Breaking Bad.” She is so underappreciated and really holds her own in a complex and unforgiving role. The third is “Breaking Bad” winning Outstanding Drama. It’s about time.
Of course, it goes without saying that this won’t deter me from watching next time. See you at the Oscars.

With the tagline “we’re born, and the rest is just one big, bad fuck,” one would expect “#Queers,” a new student-written production that ran through Sunday in the Adams Pool Theatre, to push boundaries. The show certainly lived up to its slogan—almost to excess—with provocative humor, direct discussion of sex, exploration of queer relationships, and a scene set in a sex club. “#Queers” consisted of two one-acts, the first being much shorter and weaker than the second, although both maintained a bold and impressive sense of self. Buoyed by strong performances throughout, the play successfully exuded a charm that buzzed with near fearless energy, entertaining as iy simultaneously prompted the audience to explore blurred boundaries of sexuality, love, and relationships.
The first act, “Don’t Say Gay,” was limited to just one scene and depicted the interaction between talk show host Phyllis (Mariah T. Browne ’15), her guest, Researcher Dan (Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15), and the audience. The characters were clearly supposed to be caricatures, presenting overblown and false beliefs about homosexuality, and were mostly played to great effect. Occasionally, though, the pretense stretched a little too far, as the over-the-top mannerisms became distracting and the jokes slightly too far-fetched. When in motion, the visceral energy of the actors—including a condom-throwing episode that took place in the audience—made the ridiculousness enjoyable. Only when the characters were confined to their chairs did the gestures and affectations detract from the content of their lines.
Much of the credit for the humor in “#Queers” is owed to Michael Shayan ’14, who wrote and directed the show. In the second act, “Kisses,” a much longer and more complex exploration of characters and their emotions, Shayan successfully combines the humor evident in the first act with more substantial material. The act focused on a love triangle between Shawn (Michael S. Gellman ’17), his best friend and object of affection, Matt (Alexander M. Willis ’14), and Matt’s girlfriend Lindsay (Karoline K. Xu ’16). Critically, the script incorporates a significant portion of each character’s backstory into the dramatic present, which serves to make the characters both more believable and understandable in their actions. Shayan’s choice to employ extended monologues taut with both hilarity and personal trauma proves incredibly effective in fleshing out the characters and remaining engaging. These minutes-long soliloquies successfully and authentically displayed the wide range of emotions inherent in relationships and allowed the talented actors to shine uninhibited.
Gellman especially excelled in this regard. His portrayal of Shawn was at times hilarious and heartbreaking as the character oscillated from nonchalance to deep emotional pain, all handled with aplomb. His performance was a standout, but by no means the only successful one. The entirety of the cast embodied their roles well, including Shayan himself as an especially humorous and high-energy Fairy Godmother in drag.
One apparent weakness of “#Queers” was the incongruence between the two acts; the first act was shorter and delved less into substantial themes of queer relationships than with the second act. In comparison, the second act seemed far more developed and therefore more meaningful. Additionally, the show’s curious tendency to reference its own status as a fictitious play contrasted sharply with the authenticity of the characters. Extended and frank discussion about lighting, staging, stagehands, scripts, and monologues distracted from a genuine engagement with the storyline. At times, this self-awareness did provide some humor, but in the end, it undermined the honesty and depth of the story—the heart of the play.
However, this issue was often overshadowed by the show’s greater strengths—vitality, humor, complexity, and frankness. Yes, “#Queers” is a little shocking at first. But the end result was not a flashy political agenda, but rather a complex and funny production that entertained and successfully explored queer relationships in modern society.

Jonathan Lethem opened with a joke Thursday night at the Brattle Theatre, expressing his relief that the Red Sox had finished off the Tampa Bay Rays so that he wasn’t competing with them for viewership. Eliciting warm chuckles from the mostly full auditorium, Lethem immediately came off entirely devoid of pretense. Wearing business casual and sipping on a water bottle, the MacArthur Fellow and author of nine novels, often dystopian and genre-bending, stood at the podium to read and discuss his new work, “Dissident Gardens.” The novel, an examination of leftist radicalism through three generations of the Queens-based Angrush family, traces characters’ journeys through the Red Scare and the counterculture movement of the ’60s all the way up to the Occupy Movement. Lethem appeared rejuvenated by his departure from his usual genre, and his sincerity and enthusiasm shone through as he talked about “Dissident Gardens.”
The opening baseball joke turned out to be an apt segue into the excerpt from the novel that Lethem read, in which Lenny Angrush, a frenetic young Communist, attempts to create a professional team named the Sunnyside Proletariats. The quasi-historical scene has Lenny presenting the potential theme song for the squad, a Greenwich Village Irish folk ditty, to a bigwig and his secretary. The scene is rooted in the actual push for a New York team after the departure of the Giants and Dodgers for the West Coast in the late 1950s, and the scene’s bigwig is no other than the lawyer Bill Shea, the eventual founder of the Mets. The scene captures the era with referential flair; Lenny decries Jackie Robinson’s conservatism, while Shea name-drops longtime baseball commissioner Ford Frick and New York mayor Robert Wagner, Jr. In an especially hilarious moment, the secretary suggests that if Lenny really wants to appeal to the “popular front” with his jingle, he should go for street-corner doo-wop as opposed to folk. Lenny agrees, commenting with deep stoicism on the “dialectical curveball” the secretary throws in his direction.
The above scene combines historical subtlety and mood with humorous glimpses into Lenny’s psyche. Simultaneously attempting to juggle Shea’s obvious disapproval of the Proletariats and his pathetically awkward flirtation with Shea’s secretary, Lenny struggles to remember the secretary’s name while pondering over how to avoid presenting the team as inherently Communist. Lethem, an understated yet effective reader, provided Lenny with a nervous New York accent, which he countered with Shea’s smooth lawyer voice. He pronounced his own astonishingly varied and complex vocabulary with ease, presenting detailed descriptions of hands, hems, and expressions. The futility of Lenny’s proposal, which ends with Shea announcing that he’d already secured the National League’s approval for the Mets, is both sardonic and somewhat heartbreaking. The scene represents well the novel’s intermingling of tragicomic character study and sociocultural analysis.
At the conclusion of the excerpt, Lethem opened up the house to a relaxed question-and-answer session. Candid and kind, Lethem revealed that he himself was a “red-diaper baby” (the child of Communist sympathizers) and had poured many autobiographical elements into his novel. The Angrush matriarch was loosely based on Lethem’s own grandmother. Yet the improvisation and spontaneity of fiction writing, Lethem said, led the character in a number of directions that deviated from those his grandmother took. Lethem jumped effortlessly through a wide range of topics, including his desire to mimic Dickensian reference to 1850s London in his largely New York-centric canon. Lenny’s otherworldly personality, Lethem also said, can be viewed as a replacement for his usual sci-fi elements that are lacking in “Dissident Gardens.”
Other audience queries had nothing to do with “Dissident Gardens.” Several questions focused on Lethem’s acclaimed 2003 novel “Fortress of Solitude,” leading the author to wax nostalgic on the “special place” he was in while writing the tome. Another audience member asked about Edward Norton’s long-delayed adaptation of “Motherless Brooklyn,” in response to which Lethem quipped that he was fine with whatever happened, having already received his compensation for the option.
Lethem ended the discussion with a brief polemic on the psychological complexity of “pure ideology.” Himself a believer in the necessity of ideological compromise and skepticism, Lethem wrote “Dissident Gardens,” and a bevy of his other work, partially as an examination of those who, like Lenny, believe completely in their respective causes. His philosophical concerns evidently have remained constant through his switch in genres. His latest novel’s grounding in the natural world may be a departure from much of his previous writing, but in “Dissident Gardens,” Lethem’s ideological explorations will once again find a home through his emotional honesty and deep knowledge of traits of the past.

Throughout his 64 novels, Stephen King has tackled a great many monsters, ghosts, and demons, but in his newest novel “Doctor Sleep,” King takes on his greatest feat yet: the sequel. “Sequel” is always a dangerous word, but when the sequel’s predecessor is as widely acclaimed as “The Shining”—King’s 1977 novel of which the horrific pages and subsequent movie adaptation still haunt fans—the peril intensifies. King has a lot to live up to in “Doctor Sleep.” Luckily for his fans, King, for the most part, delivers. However, “Doctor Sleep” takes on a far different feel from “The Shining” as it veers from King’s usual sense of pure dread and instead tells a redemptive fantasy. “The past is gone,” a grown-up Dan Torrance thinks as he is forced to mentally revisit The Overlook, the Colorado resort that he had escaped from 36 years ago in “The Shining.” However, despite the decades separating a 40-something Dan from the destruction of both the haunted lodge and his possessed father, Jack Torrance, that past continues to define Dan’s present in the pages of “Doctor Sleep.”
Though it picks up years after the reader was last with young Danny, watching The Overlook go down in flames at the end of “The Shining,” “Doctor Sleep” is quick to catch up on the life of the uniquely gifted Dan after being freed from the demons of his childhood. Unfortunately, Dan Torrance’s adult life is far from demon-free, as he has adopted his father’s vice: alcoholism. Dan finds that drunkenness is the only way to dim his supernatural powers—the ability to read minds and see dead spirits still roaming on Earth, more commonly known as “the shining.”
Just as the hopeless tone of “Doctor Sleep” starts becoming monotonous, the pace changes after Dan hits his ultimate low, stealing from a broke, drug-addicted single mother after a long night at a bar and in her bed. Seeing the true “scumbag” he has become, Dan decides to leave his apartment and quit drinking. The storyline thus far sounds incredibly cliché, especially for Stephen King, an author who is known for avoiding the norm. However, King himself suffered alcoholism and drug addiction, becoming sober in the 80s through rehab and family support. Therefore, King’s ability to describe Dan’s struggle for sobriety has a realistic rawness, one that allows King to depict an apparently banal life in language that feels fresh. While Dan may not have the family support of King, it is through AA meetings and a hospice job that utilizes his unworldly talent that he establishes the closest thing he has had to a “normal” life since his time at The Overlook. But this normal life only lasts so long, as Dan is sought out by Abra, a young girl who “shines exceptionally bright.”
Abra’s shining leads her not only to get in telepathic contact with Dan but also into serious danger as she touches the mind of the leader of the True Knot, a group of psychic “vampires.” While the prospects of yet another vampire book may seem vexing, do not cast aside “Doctor Sleep,” for the vampires King creates are not the conventional bloodsucking type; rather, the True Knot feeds off of “steam,” or the life force that leaves young children with the shining as they are tortured to death. Their leader Rose sees Abra’s unequivocally powerful steam as the True Knot’s only chance for survival. With this desperation, the hunt for little Abra becomes both a chase across the country and a chilling battle between minds—a battle that “Uncle” Dan will not let Abra face alone.
Reading Stephen King is a unique experience. With each turning page a sense of doom grows, making the reader terrified to see what happens next, yet unable to set the book down. “The Shining” is a classic example of the spell King casts through his writing. In its pages, one can feel the silent yet blood-chilling tension between the supernatural and real worlds in the countless rooms and halls of The Overlook. This tension is lacking in “Doctor Sleep.” While action builds throughout the novel in the form of kidnappings and gunfights, the busyness of the book detracts from any sense of creeping dread rather than adding to it.
The transparency of “Doctor Sleep” takes it yet another step farther from its prequel. Unusual for King, the motives of his characters in “Doctor Sleep” are as clear as black and white. The vampires are evil and want food and power. Abra is good and wishes to put an end to the killing of children, saving her own life in the process. This missing air of mystery, paired with the already lacking tension and a whole lot of vampires, causes “Doctor Sleep” to lose any fearsome unknowns, lose the goosebump-inducing chapters traditional to King, and essentially to tell an action-packed fantasy story instead of a horror one.
Ironically, the redeeming quality of “Doctor Sleep” is its theme of redemption. Danny Torrance was a greatly beloved character in “The Shining,” and despite his ugly introduction in King’s newest novel, one once again cannot help but fall in love with Dan. King weaves a web of words that can explain both the supernatural struggles of his protagonist and the dark, complex ones rooted in the world we live in. Through his personal experiences with alcoholism and his mastery of language, King is able to depict a very real, raw man in Dan Torrance despite the character’s fantastical surroundings. Dan’s internal battle with and triumph over addiction makes “Doctor Sleep” a testament to King’s message that men can overcome their demons—a message portrayed so craftily and grippingly that “Doctor Sleep,” while perhaps not of the same caliber as “The Shining,” makes a name of its own.

Indie rock outfit the Dismemberment Plan achieved underground sainthood with their 1999 record “Emergency & I,” an album full of musical and lyrical  idiosyncrasies  that coalesced with singer Travis Morrison’s raw vocals to create a neurotic masterpiece. The group disbanded after its next record, 2001’s “Change,” and reunited in 2011 to tour. “Uncanney Valley” is the Dismemberment Plan’s first record in 12 years. Any songwriting hiatus of such length will have a profound impact on a band’s sound, and it certainly shows here. “Uncanney Valley” noticeably abandons some of the band’s guitar-heavy instrumentation for a healthy supplement of synthesizers. While this new source of sonic diversity makes for a compelling listen, “Uncanney Valley” ultimately falls short of its predecessors’ brilliance, largely due to uninspired lyricism.
Apart from a few lyrical standouts, much of “Uncanney Valley” is sonically interesting but is deflated by uncreative lyricism. Songs like “Go and Get It” and “Living in Song” exhibit some entertaining synth tricks the band has picked up since its last record, but don’t leave a lasting impression. “Go and Get It” attempts to express a youthful exuberance, but ultimately falls flat, possibly because those performing it are 40 years old. “Living in Song” is an angsty reflection on a career in music performance that finds no emotional foothold.
Some songs overcome lyrical flatness with sonic instrumental innovation and novel imagery. “Mexico City Christmas” combines an electronic drum track with live drums, and sounds like it came from a Sega Genesis. It’s delightful beat supports its strange images and lifts the song out of “forgettable” territory.
The subpar nature of the album’s  subject matter isn’t uniform. That’s far from the case, as is exhibited by songs like “No One’s Saying Nothing,” the album’s opener, which confronts the addictive influence of the internet. The first lyrics from Morrison don’t disappoint. “You hit the spacebar enough and cocaine comes out / I really like this computer,” he sings. It’s a novel way into one of contemporary culture’s most harped-on issues. Lyrics like this are the Dismemberment Plan’s bread and butter, and “Nothing” delivers them consistently. In addition to its clever lyrics, “Nothing” carries on the Dismemberment Plan’s idiosyncratic musical tradition; the first 20 seconds combine sleigh bells, shimmering guitars, and galloping drums, all three intertwining to create a unique and intriguing cadence.
Another point of “Valley”  in which the 12-year gap seems to have sharpened the band’s intuition instead of dulled it is “Daddy Was a Real Good Dancer.” The song, which concerns the nature of being a father, offers a emotive and touching perspective that 2001’s Dismemberment Plan did not possess. “Daddy” is as lyrically dense as the band’s best work, staying ambiguous as to whether Morrison is speaking of his father or identifying himself as an imminent “Daddy.” The malleable self-awareness of the song serves it well; when Morrison sings “when I finally lay my creaky old bones to rest / I hope I’m not a mystery to those who knew me best,” it doesn’t sound clichéd. The song relies on the unpretentious instrumentation of a spare guitar and tapping snare, more reminiscent of the band’s early days but without the fascinating old tics. It’s not raw—it’s polished and compelling.
Perhaps the most representative sample of “Uncanney Valley” is the album’s second song, “Waiting.” The piece begins with a clever musical device—a marching band fanfare transitions almost flawlessly into a catchy synth-driven groove. That’s where it all falls apart. After Morrison starts to sing, the song morphs into a garden-variety angst-driven song about an ex-lover. “Well, look who it is / been a little while since you been up in my biz,” Morrison starts, and it doesn’t get much better from there. “I’m just waiting, anticipating someone who will treat me great / Knows that I ain’t second rate,” he sings near the climax of the song. Juxtaposed against the brilliance of songs like “Daddy Was a Real Good Dancer,” and “No One’s Saying Nothing,” the lyrical vapidity of “Waiting” is frankly mystifying.
“Uncanney Valley” has some standout tracks, but the band seems content to let those float over a bed of forgettable ones. While records from the “Emergency & I” era were constant displays of mastery, this new material is merely dappled with good ideas. While the standout songs excite, the filler tracks become tedious enough to sink the record. “Uncanney Valley” illustrates another segment of the Dismemberment Plan’s trajectory, which unfortunately seems to be headed downward.

"23"
Mike WiLL Made-It, “Est. in 1989, Pt. 3”
The fun and trap-inspired beat by Mike WiLL Made-It is mostly ruined by clumsy verses from Juicy J, an especially catatonic Wiz Khalifa, and, in her rap debut (if we don’t count “Hoedown Throwdown”—and honestly I kind of do), Cyrus. For her part, Cyrus does her best Young Money impersonation, momentarily capturing Future’s flow from “Karate Chop” and singing a somewhat catchy though verbally boneheaded (“With my hands in the sky / I wave ‘em from side to side,” etc.), chorus. Ostensibly an ode to wearing Air Jordans, the track is surprisingly light on references to the legendary baller; basketball shoes and smoking weed have a minimal thematic relationship, and one can’t help wishing that a few of the familiar ganja rehashes (pun most definitely intended) could have been about Scottie Pippen or “Space Jam” instead.
"All Me"
Drake, "Nothing Was The Same"
Drake’s rollicking single from his highly anticipated third album “Nothing Was the Same” had built a buzz on the artist’s ever-expanding Soundcloud channel before it officially dropped last weekend. The track, replete with gong-heavy production that sounds almost like “Enter Sandman,” contains features from G.O.O.D. Music veterans 2 Chainz and Big Sean, who rap relatively derivative “Cruel Summer”-esque verses. Sean’s is more interesting, with hints of a new flow and a hilarious shout-out to his “Glee” fiance Naya Rivera. Drake is the star, though, offering a bravado and staccato statement about how he’s “got everything,” while musing about his difficult-to-track finances and sexual exploits with former babysitters. A nice moment of respite on an album of largely introspective tracks, “All Me’’ is an egocentric and intensely bumpable song.
"Monster"
Imagine Dragons
The new single by Imagine Dragons is the most musically psychedelic thing they’ve ever put out. Originally recorded for the video game “Infinity Blade III,” the track embraces drippy electronic elements that evoke the “Final Fantasy” soundtrack. The woozy piano that opens the track is so trippy that it would have been welcome throughout the entirety of the song. Vocalist Dan Reynolds tries to recreate the vulnerable, Coldplay-style vocals he debuted on smash hit “Demons” earlier this year.  The arena template takes over here, however, and Reynolds soon drops the quiet emotionalism for a bombastic chorus that sounds a bit too much like “Radioactive.” The cop-out chorus doesn’t entirely overshadow the exciting instrumental textures, but it stops “Monster” from being a true step towards increased creative complexity for the band.

Musician Reylon A. Yount ’16 has played a Chinese instrument called the yangqin since the third grade. Yount has performed at many events on campus and recently played with the Reno Philharmonic Orchestra in his first-ever orchestral performance. This performance was part of his participation in the Davidson Fellowship, a competitive award that gives scholarships to people ages 18 and younger who have completed a significant piece of work in various fields. Yount was the first recipient of an award in the music category who plays a non-Western classical instrument. Yount plans to continue playing around campus and at other venues in Boston before graduating in the fall of 2016.
The Harvard Crimson: How did you get involved with classical Chinese music?
Reylon A. Yount: In third grade, our music teacher brought in a music ensemble called the Melody of China. I stuck with the yangqin and took private lessons outside of school. I had a concert during the winter of my freshman year [of high school] that had a fantastic reaction. That was the moment that I realized I could continue playing the yangqin even though my audience was no longer Chinese. Around that same time, the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing created an operation in the Bay Area to hold grade exams and competitions for Chinese music. I now had these great outlets for measuring my own projects and going for these competitions and exams. It was a beautiful coming together of the right time, right place, right resources, and right teachers.
THC: What is the main difference you find between Chinese music and western music?
RAY: The main purpose of Chinese music is just to capture the beauty that the composer sees in his or her surroundings. For example, the piece that I played with the [Reno] Philharmonic Orchestra is called “Spirit of the Yellow Earth.” The composer, whom I had the chance to study with for two summers, talked to me about how he imagined these beautiful wilderness vistas of this barren landscape of the deserts of western China, and the catharsis he feels when looking at such a free and empty landscape. Chinese music doesn’t have any other agenda than to convey beauty. In Western music you have a lot of composers composing very intellectually. In Chinese music, it’s often just what the composer thinks sounds really beautiful.
THC: What is the most challenging thing and the most rewarding thing about being a musician?
RAY: The most challenging thing about being a musician is being persistent. Inevitably as a musician you’ll meet challenges. For me it was often the feeling of being isolated because I don’t play an instrument that fits into an orchestra. The most rewarding thing is getting to connect with audiences at a much deeper level than words can reach. It’s amazing to introduce a completely new sound and history and culture to a Western audience. The reactions I’ve been getting so far have exceeded my expectations and encouraged me to keep going. At my recent performance in Reno, there was one bass player in the orchestra who said she started crying in the middle of the piece. My goal is to use music as a catalyst for both cultural and artistic exchange, and those moments when I am able to make the bridge for people to connect with something that is outside of their own culture and world is more than I could ask for.
THC: How has your time at Harvard affected your music?
RAY: I really do believe that this recent performance is a continuation of the opportunities that Harvard has given me. I went to Harvard with the mindset that I would try new things in college and keep up the Chinese music on the side. But because of the opportunities at Harvard and the amazing reactions, I realized I needed to make Chinese music my number one thing.
THC: Do you plan on playing the yangquin after college?
RAY: Maybe. Especially after this performance [with the Reno Philharmonic], I feel really inspired. I am definitely considering the possibility of doing performances at this scale if the opportunities present themselves. I plan to finish my undergrad and master’s before pursuing a music career. I definitely still want music as my main extracurricular. Music is a way I’m able to communicate with other people. Without that outlet, I’d be able to function, but I would definitely be missing something big.

In the last 20 years, there has been a significant revival of interest in folk and Americana among a new generation of artists. This trend is largely tied to the explosion of popularity of indie bands and musicians, who possess an acoustic aesthetic that hearkens back to the old musical traditions of this country—artists such as Mumford and Sons, Sufjan Stevens, the Lumineers, and Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes. On Thursday, Sanders Theatre hosted Béla Fleck’s Banjo Summit, a concert that featured several of the greatest banjo players alive today, some of whom date back to the historical revival era of American banjo music in the 1960s and 1970s and some of whom have begun their musical careers relatively recently. The event conveyed this historical continuum with unparalleled vigor and joy.
The event was presented by the Celebrity Series of Boston, which is now in its 75th year. The caliber of the artists on hand was astonishing; even those who do not frequently listen to bluegrass are familiar with the work of an artist like Eric Weissberg, composer of the classic “Dueling Banjos,” who is also known for his work with Bob Dylan on the album “Blood on the Tracks.” The headline artist, Béla Fleck, was personal friends with the late giant and influential bluegrass musician, Earl Scruggs. These artists were two of seven banjo players participating in this event, all great innovators in the practice of the instrument from every period of its development in the last 50 years. The event highlighted a cross-section of banjo history and a diversity of musical styles.
The concert’s first number, “Cripple Creek,” was an especially striking example of the continuity and tradition conveyed by the program. The band played accompaniment continuously while each performer came onstage separately to perform a solo, creating a rich tapestry of individual styles set into a unified work. As the concert went on, the continuity was emphasized in the introductions each artist gave to the pieces he or she was playing, which referred not only to the artists on stage, but also to other musical giants who had influenced him or her and with whom that artist had worked.
Fleck, a much-decorated musician with multiple Grammys to his name back to 1998, dominated much of the show, especially the second set, and provided a thematic center for the concert. While remaining rooted in the old traditions of the instrument, he pioneered the use of the banjo as something greater than a folk instrument, as evidenced by his new album “The Imposter,” which was recently released on Decca and from which he played a selection for the concert. The work on “Imposter” is dominated by classical structures in conjunction with folk motifs, shot through with light, dancing banjo lines which recall Strauss’s use of the zither in “Geschichten aus dem Wienerwald.” Fleck’s performance of a solo arrangement of the Banjo Concerto from the album not only displayed his astounding technical skill, but also his canny nature as a performer. Throughout this piece, he communicated the audience without detracting from the music, evoking laughter by a gesture or facial expression after a particularly fanciful passage or drawing the audience in with the raw intensity of his focus on the instrument. His unassuming stage persona was likable and engaging in a mild, self-effacing way. After the show’s intermission, he asked from the stage with gentle irony, “You all are still here?”
This lack of pomposity characterized much of the show. Weissberg, before beginning his first number, said to the theater, “I’ve got a question for you all. Did all you people come here on purpose?” Such humility from masters of any art is always a heartening thing to hear, and it fostered the sense of unity conveyed by the concert’s arrangement.
The excellence of this event is in keeping with the work presented in the Celebrity Series of Boston, which brings exceptionally talented artists to perform in and around Boston. This season, the Series will feature other artistic masters such as Wynton Marsalis, Joshua Bell, Yo-Yo Ma, and graphic novelist Art Spiegelman, known primarily for his work “Maus,” who will be speaking in Sanders Theatre in May.
Béla Fleck’s Banjo Summit had flawless sound engineering, a rare feat for an all-acoustic concert. In addition to being an artistically successful concert, it was also an amazing testament to the development of the banjo tradition over time.

I haven’t watched "Glee," Fox’s teen musical comedy-drama series, since I was a senior in high school. While watching this week’s episode "The Quarterback," I found myself thinking about SAT practice and high school drama—the elements of my life circa 2009. This nostalgia reminded me of how young Cory Monteith, the late actor who was memorialized in "The Quarterback," was when he died this past July. Monteith, 31, was much older than his on-screen persona, Finn Hudson, when he died of a toxic combination of heroin and alcohol after a lifetime of battling drug addiction. Yet, the series’ poignant—if awkward—tribute to Monteith makes the tragic loss of his potential clear.
How the series chose to memorialize Monteith, however, was not necessarily a conventional choice. In "The Quarterback," Finn Hudson has recently died but the episode never reveals or alludes to his cause of death; characters talk about missing him and anecdotes from his life, but not a single clue as to how he died. The rationale behind this creative choice is essentially stated by character Kurt Hummel, Finn’s stepbrother and fellow Glee Club member. "Everyone wants to talk about how he died too, but who cares?" Kurt says in a voiceover. "One moment in his whole life. I care more about how he lived." Though there is no right way to grieve, it is questionable if the series missed an opportunity by not acknowledging how Monteith died.  
Though how Finn died may not change how Kurt and other characters mourn his loss, "The Quarterback" is still for all intents and purposes a television episode within a larger narrative. Not revealing how he died leaves a noticeable gap. In response to Kurt’s line, Hank Stuever of the Washington Post says, "Well, of course it does, if this is still a television show and not just an exercise in demonstrative grief-through-song." In a review of the episode, Stuever writes, "It came across as a bizarre absence of basic plot in a show that built its reputation on deftly locating comedy in the most uncomfortable personal details." Though in some circles, "Glee" is less than critically acclaimed due to its awkward genre shifts, improbable events, and of course, how its characters burst into song, the series is known for its striking honesty. How the characters handle extremely personal and difficult issues is one of the series’s admirable traits. Not mentioning how Finn died—whether of drug abuse like Monteith or of something else—removes a crucial element of the story.
Not specifying how Finn died does allow the episode to focus more generally on the characters’ feelings of loss and implicitly, the cast and crew’s feelings of loss as well. "We wrote it because we loved Cory," "Glee" co-creator Ryan Murphy said to Entertainment Weekly. "So the episode is about how all the people loved Cory and find it really hard to go on with the show so to speak, but that’s the whole point of this show." In the episode, this sentiment is conveyed in a memorial plaque with Finn’s picture and a quote from the McKinley High quarterback: "The show must go…all over the place…or something like that."
"Glee" will go on—despite some people’s protestations—but its choice not to acknowledge how Monteith died was not necessarily consistent with its artistic values. Furthermore, the show prides itself on illustrating how young people handle personal challenges, and drug abuse could have been one of them if "The Quarterback" was more candid. It is a fictional television show and not an afterschool special, but how the series has treated issues such as sexuality and now grief makes it clear that the series wishes to provide role models for its young fans. Characters in "The Quarterback" consistently reinforce the importance of grieving and expressing emotions and illustrates the bevy of responses to loss: in addition to the Glee club’s director, Mr. Schue, encouraging the students to sing songs that remind them of Finn, other characters such as Coach Beiste emphasize the importance of acknowledging pain and loss. Though the death of a young person is devastating no matter what the reason, the episode may implicitly prescribe a "one-size-fits-all" response to grief. Monteith’s death and struggle with drugs was highly publicized, so not acknowledging how he died was perhaps pointless, or worse, glorifying. A PSA about drug abuse aired after "The Quarterback" and mentioned Monteith candidly, but it seemed a bit moot after an entire hour of grief to a non-specific death.
"The Quarterback" blurs the lines between Cory Monteith and Finn Hudson as it attempts to mourn both in one episode. Perhaps attributing Finn’s death to drug abuse would have been untrue to the character, since Finn Hudson’s background does not include drug abuse. Perhaps attributing Finn’s death would have, as Kurt Hummel stated, not changed the ripple effects of his loss. Though there is no single right way to grieve, "Glee" missed a chance to delve into the uncomfortable by erasing how he died and focusing on the hole he left behind.

Katniss Everdeen from the "The Hunger Games" series, Hit-Girl from "Kick-Ass," Arya Stark from "Game of Thrones." All three of these pop culture icons have one very important thing in common (besides being extremely sassy): they are all incredibly violent. In books, films, and comic books, these three young women join a new crop of heroines who are adept at killing and often even enjoy it. Katniss Everdeen slays fellow tributes with her bow and arrow. Hit-Girl shoots down malicious drug dealers. Arya Stark takes revenge on those that have wronged her or her family, and she spares them no pain with her sword.
And yet, even though these three women are just as violent as their male counterparts, somehow their violence seems more acceptable. Instead of turning people off with their bloodthirsty acts, these three female killers are often seen as examples of empowered, tough female role models. But with these labels, an uncomfortable question arises: are these women seen as powerful because they are violent? In other words, for viewers and readers who worship these fierce women, does violence equal power?
There’s definitely no doubt in my mind that the violence makes them popular. In the trailer for "The Hunger Games 2: Catching Fire," which opens in theaters on Nov. 22, we see Katniss, played by Jennifer Lawrence, looking confident and smooth as she wields an axe or shoots an arrow into a moving target. When I went to see "Kick-Ass 2" this summer, many audience members cheered when Hit-Girl slaughtered five "bad guys" at a time. I have to admit, I was one of those audience members. But not one person cheered when Kick-Ass, the male protagonist of the story, killed anyone off, even though he also fights for the good side.
In a 2012 Marie Claire article, the magazine rated the "most badass heroines" of pop culture. Katniss Everdeen joined the ranks of The Bride in "Kill Bill" and Carrie Mathison of "Homeland." In the description explaining Katniss’s "badassitude," the author noted her main characteristics as "beautifully braided" and "quiver-slinging." Katniss’s unique ability to kill with her bow and arrow is a major reason why she is so popular in the trilogy. Of course, she would still be the heroine even if she didn’t happen to be an amazing hunter. Her bravery and resilience set her apart even without these skills. But making Katniss a cold killer is a huge part of her charm and appeal. It is one of the reasons it is so easy to root for her; we know she has the power to win. The same goes for Arya Stark and Hit-Girl. While they are already likable and exciting characters because of their fiery spirits, it is when they enter into warrior mode that they become unbelievably fierce and impressive. 
Without their abilities to fight, all of these female characters could easily just have been feisty victims. Katniss might have needed Peeta to save her after all. Arya Stark could have been a more volatile version of Sansa, putting up with her circumstances but definitely not liking them. In the end, their violence is what prevents them from being victims, and this is a troubling thought. This would not be concerning if there were more badass female heroines that weren’t violent. But as it stands, these three are becoming the norm, rather than the outliers. Our pop culture seems to now almost blindly worship the warrior woman.
It is also interesting to note that each of these three characters are described as tomboys and fit in more with the masculine characters around them than the feminine ones. Arya Stark even pretends to be a boy for the large part of "Game of Thrones." Hit-Girl finds it impossible to fit in with different groups of girls at school. This suggests that these female characters are popular not only because of their violence but also because of their masculine traits. They are not traditional "girls," and this is supposed to be a good thing. Indeed, it’s very rare to see a movie or TV show where a "badass" heroine is also traditionally feminine. If she is presented in this way, she is often also hyper-sexualized and wearing all leather in some ridiculous fashion.
I am a fan of all of the characters mentioned here and often wish I could be a badass heroine, fighting for the greater good, perhaps masked on the streets of Cambridge. But we should also push back against these characters becoming the norm. There must be room for ambiguity in heroines of pop culture, just like there are many shades of gray for male heroes. Heroines that avoid violence rather than exulting in it can also be considered cool and fiery. In the end, we must remember that killer ladies are fun, but they are dangerous too.

The opening song of a concert set is a statement. It sets the tone for the rest of the night and often serves to fire up the audience and make them excited they came. At the Boston Calling music festival in September, for example, Vampire Weekend started off with the stomper "Diane Young," and Kendrick Lamar busted right into his verse on the hip-hop anthem "Fuckin’ Problems." The two were bold, unexpected choices that threw the crowd into a frenzy.
You Won’t, on the other hand, waltzed onstage and promptly launched into a rather forlorn rendition of the antiquated Massachusetts state anthem. The crowd, taken aback, first laughed, then listened attentively. In front of a crowd anxious for DJs and rappers, the Boston folk duo didn’t relinquished this attention for the rest of the set.
It’s pretty clear that You Won’t do not do things like other bands. Most bands have several musicians who each stick to one instrument; You Won’t are a duo, and one of the members plays seven or eight instruments alone. These traits go beyond gimmickry, though; they’re showmen who write textured pop with influences spanning across American history.
At the very heart of You Won’t is a bromance that has been developing for years. Josh Arnoudse and Raky Sastri went to the same high school in the suburbs of Boston, and both dabbled in several different art forms. The two met while doing theater together; after high school, they switched mediums to film—"we made bizarre, experimental narrative films," Arnoudse remembers—before moving finally to music.
The duo’s theatrical background is obvious at their Boston Calling set. Arnoudse, the frontman, howls into the microphone and engages gleefully with the crowd. Sastri, the multi-instrumentalist, glides around the stage, wielding his many instruments like a series of props. It’s lively and personal, and much more than the empty showmanship displayed by one or two of the acts that would perform later that day.
Sastri plays drums, bass, harmonica, harmonium, melodica, synthesizer, and that’s just the beginning. For the band’s upcoming full-length album, he’s been recording on hammer dulcimer and the singing saw. "Every now and then I’m like, ‘Raky, get that thing out of the closet hat we haven’t used in three years! I have an idea!’" Arnoudse says. The various instruments challenge the pair to expand their songwriting tendencies and push their sound.
The band’s experimentation goes beyond instrumentation: You Won’t pulls influences from a wide range of music sources spanning centuries. "We find recordings of these random people from the Appalachians, singing in their kitchen," Arnoudse tells me earnestly. "There’s one recording that’s all sea shanties. And Raky got really into shape note singing—this dark form of religious group singing that was born in the 19th century."
There are a lot of bands nowadays hitching a ride with an Americana revivalist movement that’s heading right down the mainstream: men and women in felt vests and farmer’s hats, playing banjos, singing huge harmonies. You Won’t is not one of those bands. "That’s a movement we don’t identify with," Arnoudse says decisively. "I always feel weird when people call us a folk band—we’re a little poppier and weirder."
It’s a strikingly accurate description. To get the band’s basic sound, start with the folk-pop on the radio nowadays, strip back the pretense, and add narrative and humor. "Three-Car Garage," the first song on the band’s first album, "Skeptic Goodbye," is at first glance a three-chord ditty built on happy guitar strumming. Take a closer listen, though, and it’s an answer to the Clash’s "Lost in the Supermarket"—a protest of the false suburban ideal of the "three-car garage and swimming pool." It’s vintage protest music: blatantly anti-commercial, poetic, catchy, and deliberate without being preachy.
There’s a clear modern pop influence on the song, and Arnoudse admits to listening to the Top 40 for the hooks. But no matter how simple the songs are, Arnoudse’s lyrics always carry weight. "Sometimes it’s great to have a silly song, but it’s pretty impossible for me to write a throwaway song lyric," he admits. "I’ve tried!"
So while the other bands at Boston Calling provoked sweat, screaming, and dancing, You Won’t was perfectly happy to leave a memorable impression on the concertgoers that showed up early. They’ll be playing at TT the Bears on November 1—go see them if you want to see a band that doesn’t play by the rules.

In high school I was taught to be stupid. And stupidity was what made me succeed.
I grew up in Boulder, Colorado, a town populated by people Urban Dictionary artfully describes as “left-wingers, weird hippies, Buddhists, old people and hobos” (and don’t forget all the “granola moms” or “college kids who smoke pot in circles”). “Laid back” wasn’t the norm—it was the rule.
At my high school, a mere mention of your AP load or busy extracurricular schedule was a sure invitation for a heavy dose of ridicule. Try out those fancy new words you learned from thesaurusizing your English paper? Say goodbye to your social life.
“There’s no such thing as a stupid question” was the mantra we lived by—and as such, pretty much anything went. Stupidity was both accepted and encouraged.
But being “cool” was being apathetic, or at least appearing to be, and for a while, I couldn’t wait to get out.
When I arrived at Harvard for the first time last fall, I, like many other students who hail from a state outside the New England bubble, was greeted with quite the culture shock.
I was stunned to find that people didn’t want to appear like they were doing less than they were—if anything, they wanted to seem like they were doing more. Ask someone to recount the day and be prepared for a long string of activities followed by the exact count of the hours spent in Lamont. No longer did I feel it necessary to craft cover stories for the long nights I spent with my math textbook.
Yet while I’ve grown to accept, and even like, my neurotic, blunt, and fast-paced northern atmosphere—I still don’t understand how I end up trailing every group outing by at least a half a block—I’ve started to become increasingly nostalgic for my hometown.
What I miss most aren’t the sprawling mountains, beautiful sunsets, or even the pungent smell of marijuana that looms over the city, but rather the very thing that drove me away: its tolerance for stupidity.
What I failed to realize in high school was that from stupidity comes creativity, and from creativity comes growth. My classmates and I weren’t afraid of shouting out a wrong answer, asking what something meant, or sharing that random tangent that suddenly popped into our heads, no matter how irrelevant or incoherent. And for every thousand bad ideas came a fantastic one that would never have seen the light of day, were we even slightly wary of the ridiculous.
Upon coming to college, my proclivity for stupidity was quickly reversed. In every lecture, seminar, section, students spoke in perfectly crafted, articulate sentences, using words that went far beyond the scope of thesaurus.com. Gone were the days of dumbing down my language or shouting out the first stupid idea that popped into my head. Gone were the days I actually spoke in class.
At Harvard we pride ourselves in being tolerant, accepting of all. Yet often this circle of acceptance is much smaller than we like to imagine. When someone asks a question others perceive to be obvious, judgment is quick to ensue—stupid comments can be nearly impossible to live down; ask what state borders Montana and this lapse suddenly becomes your defining characteristic for the next four years.
In many aspects, rejecting stupidity is not such a bad thing—if you make a racist or sexist remark, you had better be prepared for the wrath of your peers. And in no way do I think this type of accountability should stop; some types of stupidity are, well, stupid. But there are certainly times when failing to express yourself in the most politically correct terms or forgetting the “right” way to say something is unfairly misconstrued.
Living by a code of say and say-nots, meticulously picking every word you utter, isn’t beneficial to anyone. An environment that inhibits your ability to fully express yourself is hardly conducive to self-growth and discovery. Sometimes when you struggle to articulate your thoughts, you end up uncovering an idea you never knew you had, and other times stupid ideas really aren’t that stupid at all.
To quote The Beatles, every now and then you must "turn off your mind, relax, and float downstream."
So leave some room in your life for the stupid. You may just trip over something worthwhile.

As I was living in New York City this summer, a good friend from high school came to visit me. He was a counselor on a program for high school students—a “teen tour” that traveled in a bus all across the United States. So on the one night that he was in town, we caught up over authentic chicken shawarma in the Lower East Side. For a full hour he told me stories about Earl the bus driver. Hired by the tour to drive the kids around, Earl was a man who had seen it all, and done it all. My friend’s impersonation of him included a deep baritone voice, drenched with a thick southern accent. His stories were hilarious and incredibly specific—I thought I could picture Earl and his unbelievable experiences perfectly.  There was no doubt about it: Earl was the bomb.
The next day I met my friend for an early breakfast to see him off. We talked until the bus pulled up, at which point I looked out the window to catch a glimpse of the infamous Earl. When he stepped off, I almost choked on my bagel. He was exactly how I pictured him in every way—large-bellied, white t-shirt with jeans, tennis shoes, greying hair—except one: Earl was white. Blood rushed to my face. I thought to myself, “Hadn’t my friend said he was black? I swear I thought I remember him saying that.” That was, of course, impossible. The only explanation was that my impulsive, sub-conscious biases had permeated the image that I had of this man. Because he was a bus driver from the south, I had assumed without even a thought that he must be black.
I cannot even begin to describe the emotions that followed: total embarrassment, anger, frustration, disappointment. What I had done was utterly wrong—no question about it. I was shocked at myself because I had always been the liberal-minded, politically correct member of my Texan family.  That’s not to say that I grew up in an environment where stereotypes were encouraged. But it would be wrong of me to claim that they did not exist. Still, I was the one who called my grandparents out for even borderline-stereotypical statements about people of different beliefs or ethnicities. And even though my assumption about Earl’s race had not actually caused anybody any damage, I felt the nagging urge to do something about it. But of course, there wasn’t anything I could do. I still feel the pang of guilt deep in my chest every time I think about it.
Of course, this incident made me question the other ways in which I perceive those around me—a facet of my personality I had, until that moment, believed to be fairly objective. And the questions went beyond race. What do I conclude about people who have more body fat? Or who always wear makeup? Or who speak with a thick southern accent? Do I change my level of confidence talking to certain people based on a predetermination of their social abilities, or their levels of intelligence? Do I naturally attempt to befriend only those whose outward appearances I believe reflect a certain type of person underneath? In other words, how often am I stereotyping people on a daily basis without even realizing it?
Feeling the need to confess to somebody my subconsciously racist thoughts, I confided in my best friend. She told me that I shouldn’t feel bad because the assumption I had made about Earl might have been made by anybody. We’re human beings and we naturally categorize people into groups based on previous knowledge and experience. Therefore, my assumption about Earl was natural and even arguably reasonable.
I could not disagree with her more. Perhaps she was right to point out that I am not the only person who would have jumped to the conclusion that Earl was black. But we cannot simply discount our prejudices based on the justification that as human beings we are naturally inclined to make preconceived assumptions about people. Rather, it is because human beings have a natural tendency to group people into categories that we must dedicate a significant amount of effort to combating those tendencies. We should never be overly confident in our abilities to analyze people equally. By pretending that our stereotypes of others don’t exist, we only reinforce the existence of those stereotypes.
Therefore, it is the responsibility of each of us to be conscious of how we analyze people. We need to sharpen our radars for times that we make baseless assumptions about people, like the assumption I made about Earl. Only by recognizing the existence of these preempted judgments are we able to work to eradicate them. I can’t take back the way I pictured Earl before I saw him. But I guarantee that the next time somebody describes to me somebody I haven’t met, I’m not going to make any assumptions.

Gap years aren’t rare at Harvard—and any freshman who has marked a friend’s 20th birthday knows that. Gap year experiences are as varied as the class each of the students belongs to. Research, volunteering, paid work, and travel are all possibilities. In America, however, the opportunity to simply unwind and reflect has often been neglected in favor of commercialized, accredited gap-year programs edged with scholastic and pre-professional striving.
Among Britons, taking a gap year is a common practice, but also a different one. It often has as its express aim pleasure and relaxation, and many Brits spend the interlude between high school and university at home, on the beach, or at the club. This is quite the counterpoint to its American homologue. Both are valid, but students in the United States would benefit from examining the British approach more closely. No one needs reminder of the great stresses induced by junior and senior years of high school and the college application process, and some require more than the intervening summer to deflate. Their decision should be respected, perhaps celebrated for its break from the norm. There is no one way to do a gap year, and we must ensure high school seniors know that. Accreditation for gap year programs sends the wrong message, stamping the imprimatur of an academic association on certain experiences and spurning others.
Colleges should support students in their choices, whatever they be. Making gap years accessible to all students is a worthy goal to which universities may contribute. Targeted information, travel stipends, and other forms of assistance could help students form post-high school plans that are best for them. Some structure may also be desirable. Princeton has developed a yearlong bridge program that deploys students to service-related projects in India, China, Peru, Brazil, and Senegal. While Harvard, like most schools, permits admitted high school seniors to defer the admission for a year, it does not actively encourage gap years and would do well to consider a program like Princeton’s Bridge Year.
A gap year might be the longest uninterrupted stretch of time in which one is unencumbered by school, work, or family obligations. We hope high school students make the most of it. And on their own terms.

A fight broke out among four non-Harvard affiliates in front of Kirkland House around 8 p.m. Sunday, according to Kirkland House Master Verena A. Conley.
Conley said that the altercation began when three of the individuals, whom she described as musicians, attempted to avoid associating with the fourth individual. This person was pushed to the ground, according to Conley.
The disturbance was heard by her husband and co-House Master Thomas C. Conley, who called the Harvard University Police Department.
At 8:30 p.m., four HUPD police cars, a police van, and a police motorcycle were present outside of Kirkland. Although an ambulance was present at the scene, Verena Conley said she did not believe anyone was hospitalized or arrested.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote in an email to The Crimson that an incident occurred between non-Harvard affiliates.
“No Harvard students, faculty, or staff were involved,” Catalano wrote.
According to Catalano, the police report for this incident was not available at press time, and, therefore, no other details about the incident could be confirmed.
This is not the first incident to occur near Harvard houses this semester. Two stabbings took place close to Eliot House in September, with one on Memorial Drive and the other in JFK Park.

Graduate students hoping to study Computational Science and Engineering may soon find a new home at Harvard. The Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences announced on Friday that it will offer a two-year Master of Engineering in the field beginning in fall 2014.
Unlike the one-year Master of Science degree in CSE that the University began offering this fall, the two-year Master of Engineering degree will provide students with the opportunity to “build greater research and technical skills, apply computation to a domain of interest, and complete a substantial project with a research mentor,” according to a SEAS press release.
Students involved in the two-year program will be required to write a thesis, which Cristopher R. Cecka, a SEAS lecturer and researcher on applied computational science, said will be especially helpful for students who wish to pursue academia.
“A year of research gives you a lot of experience in developing solutions to problems that you wouldn’t encounter in just homework or something like that,” Cecka said. “Being immersed in the research for a year and having to write up and potentially publish your master’s thesis is something really important, not just for going into industry, but also for going back into academia.”
Cecka also said that students enrolled in the Master of Engineering program would have exposure to professors in related departments, who might recruit the students as Ph.D. candidates.
Meg Hastings, interim executive director of SEAS’s Institute for Applied Computational Science, emphasized the degree’s flexibility. The Institute’s courses, activities, and research opportunities will be featured in the new program.
“With any new program, there are a lot of opportunities, and we’re hoping to learn a lot from the students and the faculty to help us shape the program as we get it started,” Hastings said.
A survey conducted by Daniel S. Weinstock, SEAS’s assistant director of graduate studies in CSE, suggested that 10 of the 24 students currently enrolled in the Master of Science program would be interested in transferring to the second year of the Master of Engineering program at the end of the spring.
Despite the survey, Rosalind Reid—a fellow in computer science involved with developing the Master of Engineering—suggested some doubt that all 10 would enroll.
“This is an area where there is a tremendous amount of interest from employers and from industry and so some students who would like to do a second year will nevertheless be offered fantastic jobs and may make a decision to go into the job market,” Reid said.
While many of the disciplines taught at SEAS have Ph.D. programs, the computational science and engineering field has yet to develop one. Instead, SEAS remains focused on development of its two Masters programs, according to Hastings.
Reid said SEAS considers any potential creation of a Ph.D. program to be a five to 10 year process.
“You can’t say, specifically, we want to go fast or slow on the Ph.D.,” Reid said.  “Before you have a Ph.D. program in place, you need to have sufficient faculty to advise the students, and you need to have an academic track that is available to these students if they wanted to go apply for faculty jobs.”
Reid acknowledged that other schools with larger faculties have been able to develop Ph.D. programs. Still, she stressed stressed Harvard’s advantages.
“Rather than growing it out of any existing department or a lot of faculty who are already here, we were able to take a fresh approach,” Reid said. “This is a program built on applied math, computer science, and now statistics at Harvard. We’re putting these together in a unique way, and I think that that is creating a program that is unparalleled anywhere else.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
For the 25th anniversary of National Coming Out Day on October 11, Houses across campus showed support for bisexual, gay, lesbian, transgender, and queer students with rainbow cakes at dinner and study breaks in honor of the day.
 
According to W. Powell Eddins ’16, a political co-chair of the QSA, this year’s events purposely took on a new tone that “framed coming out day as a discussion, rather than ‘forcing’ people to come out.”
 
“[This year] was respectful to people who are in the closet, as well as those who are more marginalized in the BGLTQ community,” Eddins said. “We need to continue looking at how coming out affects every letter of the acronym.”
 
In recognition of the day, BGLTQ tutors in several undergraduate Houses spearheaded events to cultivate discussion in the Houses. In Winthrop, tutor Kip C. Richardson organized a table in the dining hall with candy and information on BGLTQ resources.
 
“We’re here to remind everyone that Winthrop is an affirming place for people of all backgrounds,” said Richardson, who also hosted an informal open house in his suite on Thursday night. “Sometimes just sitting at a table with rainbow flags can be a powerful act.”
 
Richardson, a BGLTQ tutor for Winthrop, mentioned the importance of giving students “space and time to reflect on the meaningfulness of the coming out process.” National Coming Out Day is also a time for straight people to come out as BGLTQ allies, he said.
 
In addition to House festivities, there were several events organized by Queer Students and Allies and the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, including an EqualiTEA hosted by the Lowell House Masters on Thursday, a forum for sharing coming out narratives on Friday, and a night at the Queen’s Head pub on Saturday.
 
Ivel Posada ’14, co-chair of the QSA, attended the EqualiTEA hosted by Lowell House Masters Diana L. Eck and Dorothy A. Austin. Posada said that he thought it was fitting that the first BGLTQ House Masters opened their home to celebrate National Coming Out Day, and that he appreciated the chance to talk to senior Harvard affiliates.
 
“It provided a sense of history on how Harvard has changed over time,” he said, adding that he talked to attendees about what it was like to be gay at Harvard 50 years ago.
 
Despite the presence of coming out day in many of the houses, some said that the University lacked a central effort to promote National Coming Out Day. Posada said he hoped for a campus-wide email recognizing the day from a well-known school official like University President Drew G. Faust or Interim Dean of College Donald H. Pfister.
 
“[National Coming Out Day] is also a way for the University to come out in support of the LGBTQ community,” Posada said. “Harvard didn’t use it as an opportunity to show this support. There was no administrative acknowledgement.”
 
Avik Chatterjee ’02, a BGLTQ tutor in Dunster House, noted that there is always room to be more inclusive, despite marked improvements in Harvard’s attitude toward the BGLTQ community over the years.
 
“It’s important for students to know that there are people who are supportive of you coming out,” Chatterjee said.

Representatives of the Chinese Ministry of Education and more than 10 of China’s top universities met Oct. 10 at Tsinghua University in Beijing to announce XuetangX, China’s newest online education portal.
XuetangX is powered by Harvard’s edX’s open-source platform, but the initiative is a distinct, independent organization and China’s largest online collaboration of leading universities. It will begin to launch courses on Oct. 17.
 
Chinese government and university representatives revealed the initiative just two days after another provider of massive open online courses, Coursera, announced the launch of its own Chinese-language portal.
 
The XuetangX consortium includes edX members Tsinghua and Peking University, both of which have already made several contributions to the edX platform, according to edX spokesperson Dan O’Connell.
 
“Our platform was made open-source so that other institutions could add to it and use it, and the institutions that joined us, the Chinese consortium, decided that this platform met their needs,” O’Connell said.
 
Earlier this month, the French Ministry of Higher Education also launched its own online education portal using the edX open-source platform.
 
“The decisions of the Chinese consortium and the French Ministry of Higher Education is a testament to the open-source approach that edX and its consortium have taken,” O’Connell said. EdX currently serves almost 1.5 million students from around the world and consists of 29 institutions.
 
Although Harvard was one of the founding members of the edX consortium, along with MIT, there has been little collaboration between HarvardX and XuetangX, according to HarvardX spokersperson Michael P. Rutter.
 
“Really what's happening is that XuetangX developed it themselves and took advantage of the open-source platform,” Rutter said. “Maybe there will be the possibility that Harvard will work with XuetangX, but there's nothing definitive in the works."
 
Rutter noted that there is a possibility that individual members of the Chinese consortium might license classes from Harvard but added that it is too early to confirm anything.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard students enjoyed Monday off in observance of Columbus Day, several student organizations gathered in Ticknor Lounge to advocate for the school break to be renamed “Indigenous People’s Day.” Harvard’s recognition of the holiday makes it the only Ivy League school to recognize the holiday.
Hosted by Native Americans at Harvard College, Fuerza Latina, Harvard Organization for Latin America, and Ballet Folklorico de Aztlan, the event featured traditional Native American and Latin American-style food. The event, held in Ticknor Lounge, drew about 50 attendees, who watched performances by the student-run Ballet Folklorico and outside group Urban Thunder and singer Hannabah Blue.
On past Columbus Days, NAHC has held candlelight vigils in front of Matthews Hall, which was formerly the location of the Harvard Indian College, to commemorate the culture and history of its members’ ancestors. This year, NAHC opted instead to take part in the event in Ticknor Lounge.
“We decided to do this event because we thought it would generate more participation and raise more awareness than the traditional vigil,” said NAHC President Sharon P. Carlson ’14. “We want to celebrate our culture by teaching others about it.”
At the event, members of NAHC and Fuerza Latina delivered spoken word poems about their cultural values and identities, while Urban Thunder, a Boston-based native drum group, performed traditional folk music featuring tympani drums and cymbals.
Carlson said the event was a good way to display native cultures.
“Columbus represents the point in history that began the downfall of many indigenous cultures,” she said.
The conflict of celebrating Columbus Day as a holiday while simultaneously recognizing the historical truths of Columbus’s interactions with the natives has generated mixed reactions among Harvard students.
“I’m being extremely inconsiderate in saying this, but I’ve never thought of Columbus Day in its real historical sense and enjoy having the day off,” said Cyrus M. Motanya ’17.
Others at the College disputed Harvard’s decision to have a University holiday, acknowledging how it remains the only school in the Ivy League to do so.
“I do not agree with the University's continued endorsement of Columbus Day. We are the only Ivy League school that still recognizes Columbus Day as a holiday in lieu of a more appropriate manifestation such as Indigenous People's Day,” said Kenard G. Dillon ’17.
Dillon questioned the implications of Harvard’s continual recognition of Columbus Day as essentially a school-wide holiday.
“We are a private institution and have no obligation to Federal holidays, as evidenced by our choice to not recognize Veterans Day,” Dillon said. “As the nation's top school, what message does this send to the world about our choice to legitimize, no questions asked, this holiday and its connotations?”
A University spokesperson told The Crimson that he was unaware of any recent discussions about whether to change the name of the holiday. In October 2012, University President Drew G. Faust touched on the issue during a conversation with students in Kirkland House.
“I think that what Harvard has done is just that it has traditionally observed national holidays and hasn't thought more about it than, ‘This is a day that the post office is closed and therefore Harvard doesn't open either,’” Faust said in response to a question about why the University still recognizes the holiday.
Faust also said that she did not think that Harvard previously had considered making changing the holiday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s volleyball team came back after dropping both contests last weekend with a sweep at home at the Malkin Athletic Center. After having lost two Ivy League games last week against Brown and Yale, this weekend’s sweep sent the team to second place in the Ancient Eight.
The Crimson (8-6, 3-2 Ivy) defeated Columbia (4-10, 2-3 Ivy) in three straight sets and Cornell (5-9, 2-3 Ivy) in four.
“We had a great week in practice, we really stepped it up to prepare for this week’s games,” Harvard coach Jennifer Weiss said.
HARVARD 3, COLUMBIA 0
The Harvard squad entered Saturday’s match against the Lions coming off a strong week of practice and a win Friday.
“I’m really proud of us because we worked really hard this week after coming off of two losses last weekend,” freshman Corinne Bain said. “Our practices were very high intensity so coming off this week I had the confidence that we worked to prove ourselves.”
The Crimson tallied multiple season records during the Columbia game. Bain had three service aces that put her fifth on the Harvard single season list. Junior co-captain Kristen Casey added to her season record with 21 digs, and junior middle blocker Caroline Walters had another 11-kill day.
“I think we felt good about this weekend,” Casey said. “We wanted to win in dominating style and I think that’s what we did by handling it in four [Friday] and three [Saturday].”
The Crimson had a dominant first set, winning 25-16. While the next set had Harvard trailing as Columbia took control with a winning streak, the Crimson rallied and fought back to win the second set, 25-21.
The Harvard squad refocused its momentum in the team huddles during the game.
“We got down in the second game and Columbia had a run,” said Casey. “I think we are getting so much better at staying calm in those moments and staying confident and getting our own run.”
The Lions could not psych the Crimson out as Harvard tallied 47 kills to Columbia’s 29.
“Our game plan is to always think about us and not to worry about what the other team is doing,” Weiss said. “Once we did that we play so much better as a team.”
HARVARD 3, CORNELL 1
Friday night, Harvard tallied its third consecutive win against Cornell.
Harvard dominated the match in the first set, 25-18, but the Big Red pushed back during the second and third sets and pushed the match to four sets.
“The second and third sets were definitely difficult,” freshman outside hitter Grace Weghorst said. “But really when you’re playing, you either win a game or you lose and you play another one. Winning in four is awesome but if we have to win in five we keep going.”
After a 25-23 loss in the third set, Harvard gathered itself to come back strong in the fourth set, winning, 25-16.
“I told them to focus on just what we had been practicing all week,” Weiss said. “We needed to maintain our chemistry and take their best attacker and slow her down.”
Weghorst had her first double-double with 14 kills and 11 digs. Bain almost garnered another triple-double with nine kills, 26 assists, and 12 digs. These two freshmen have contributed to the team success.
“There’s been almost no adjustment period,” co-captain Natalie Doyle said. “Grace and Corinne are doing a great job starting and contributing what they can to every game.”
Harvard managed a .224 hitting percentage with Cornell trailing at .154. Casey and Doyle contributed a total of 26 digs, while Walters, sophomore middle blocker Caroline Holte, and senior right side hitter Erin Cooney had an evenly distributed 12 blocks throughout the game.
“I think our blocking was really strong,” Bain said. “When you can get a stuff block it changes the momentum of the game.”
The Harvard squad also tallied a total of 70 digs compared to the Big Red’s 53.
“We definitely worked on hustle this weekend,” Weghorst said. “We had a bit of trouble getting to some balls last weekend so we were focusing on a lot of defense and a lot of blocking.”
The victory against Cornell set Harvard up for an improved Ivy League ranking, and after this weekend the Crimson found itself ranked second.
“As a team we’re always trying to challenge each other to get better every match,” Doyle said. “I think we have the best team that Harvard volleyball has had in years and we’re really just trying to maximize our potential and have no regrets.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the same week as coach Kevin Rhoads was named PGA New England teacher of the year, the Harvard women’s golf team claimed victory at the Harvard Invitational at the Bay Club in Mattapoisett, Mass., by a wide margin over Penn. After a close first day, the Crimson put in a better performance on Columbus Day, posting a team score of 286.
“Today is a really good day,” Rhoads said Monday. “Whenever you have a whole team effort and four scores that add up to something like that and it wasn’t just one person going low and everyone else kind of being medium—you have to be proud of that. Not only the effort, which we always try to focus on, but also to have those things come out and be such a low scoring team effort. I’m incredibly proud of [the performance].”
The first day of competition was a very close affair and by the end of play the Quakers and the Crimson were neck and neck, only separated by a total of three strokes, having established themselves as the premier competition amongst the five competing teams.
However, on Monday morning under glorious sunshine, Harvard put in arguably its best team performance of the young season. Whilst Penn went ten shots higher than their Sunday effort, the Crimson improved their score by thirteen strokes, averaging 1-over par between the four scores which counted.
“Every day that you play a new golf course, if you stay calm and you stay aware of your surroundings, it gets a little more intuitive,” Rhoads said. “I think it came together a little bit easier today because of that. We didn’t panic about being neck and neck with another team, we just stayed doing the things we normally do and with one more day of experience it turned in our favor.”
Within the impressive team performance, Harvard golfers were able to claim all of the top three spots in the individual standings. Last year’s Ivy Rookie of the year Christine Lin tied for second place with senior captain Bonnie Hu, who was honored by her teammates at the prize ceremony for her dedication as a captain. Freshman Anne Cheng finished in pole position, posting a total of 1-over par through two rounds.
“We played really well and I think it was a product of hard work,” Hu said. “Everyone here works really hard and we love being around each other so it’s fun to play. Going into the tournament, we were focusing on what we were able to do—focusing on the process. We focused on things were able to control, how committed we were to our shots, that’s usually how we play our best. Everyone on the team did a really good job of that and so I’m not surprised by the scores. I’m not surprised by the results but I am proud of them.”
The ethos of process over outcome is very much the mantra of the squad. Coach Rhoads’ philosophy can be summarized as judging a shot not by where it ends up, but rather by how the shot was played, and buying into that philosophy has seen a lot of success for the team thus far in the season.
“We’ve been indoctrinated,” Hu said. “When Kevin talks about process you can think about it in multiple ways. In small ways, you focus on details. So for example when you’re about to hit a shot, instead of focusing on the quality of the shot, you focus on things you can control, the angle your swing comes down and your pre-shot routine for example, and then let go of the result because it’s really hard to control outcome. You can put in your best effort and still shoot a poor score. But if you let go of the outcome and focus on what you can control, it’s good for your mental game and you’re able to achieve your potential better that way.”
“When our focus gets too much on the outcome, we stop doing the little things that wind up with a good outcome,” Rhoads said. “I want ourselves a little removed from what we do shot to shot, but instead what are you going to focus on within the shot. It sounds a little but tough to put your finger on and a little bit tough perhaps to buy into that philosophy, but it tends to be easier when we have a good result like today.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Led by the 6th and 10th-place performances of freshmen Robert Deng and Daniel De La Garza, the Harvard men's golf team tied for fourth at the Temple Invitational in Huntingdon Valley, PA.
 
The Crimson finished the first round in second place at 6-over par and only four shots back, but dropped to fourth after shooting a 16-over 296 on Sunday.
“I’m proud of us for getting in contention after the first day,” Deng said. “I think the more times [we’re] in contention, the more times [we] get to experience that pressure of being right there.”
Still in second place with the last five holes to play, the Crimson stumbled to the finish. Harvard shot 10 strokes over par on those final holes to finish at 22-over par, 20 strokes behind first-place Hartford.
De La Garza, who shot the Crimson’s only subpar round of the weekend with a first round 69 on the par 70, 6,638-yard Philmont Country Club course, was one of the Harvard golfers who struggled through the end of the back nine on Sunday. He shot 3-over par on his final three holes.
“The last few holes, especially the 16th and 17th, were challenging,” De La Garza said. “On 16 you had to hit a very good tee shot and 17 was a par three where we didn’t really know what the wind was doing so it was hard to know what [club] to hit.”
None of the other 92 golfers came close to challenging Hartford's Evan Russell for the individual title. Russell overcame a double-bogey on Saturday and a bogey on Sunday at the 16th hole to shoot a 62-68, eight strokes ahead of the pack. He had 14 birdies on the weekend, including ten on Saturday. In the four tournaments he has appeared in this season, Russell now has two victories and a second-place finish.
Russell and teammate Anthony Vecchiarelli were the only competitors to shoot both rounds under par, leading the Hawks to a 2-over par team result. Led by Dylan Crowley's third-place finish at even-par 140, St. John's finished in second with a team score of 577, while the Crimson rounded out the podium at 582.
The next highest Ivy League team was the University of Pennsylvania at 29-over, with Princeton, Cornell, Dartmouth and Brown further down the leaderboard.
Harvard bounced back nicely after coming in 15th out of 16 teams at the Windon Memorial three weeks ago.  This weekend, Deng and De La Garza led the way with scores of 143 and 144 respectively, and every Crimson golfer finished in the top 40 out of 93.
“[Saturday] I felt really good and hit many quality iron shots,” De La Garza said. “My putting was not great, but I was able to hang in there around par and had a good finish. [Sunday] was a completely opposite round—I didn’t hit the ball very well but was able to putt well.”
While De La Garza saw his score rise on day two, Deng managed to work his way to a solid 1-over par second round after posting a 2-over on Saturday.
“I came into the round feeling positive about my game knowing I could go pretty low [with my score],” Deng said. “I got a couple of bad breaks here and there and found myself at 3-over par through seven [holes], but I was able to stage somewhat of a charge coming back, but near the end a couple of mistakes came back.”
For the rest of the team, the second round was not nearly as strong as the first. Sophomore Rohan Ramnath was consistent with 15 pars on Saturday, but had six bogeys and a double-bogey on Sunday to finish the tournament at 9-over par. Fellow sophomore Un Cho shot a 72 in the first round but had no birdies in the second to finish at 8-over 148.
Like the rest of the Crimson, freshman Kendrick Vinar struggled on holes 16 through 18 in both rounds, posting a 4-over par on those three holes. Other than those, though, he managed a 3-over mark and finished at 7-over par for the weekend.
“As a whole, we gave it our best effort this weekend, which is really all we can ask of ourselves,” Deng said. “As we gain more experience, we start to get more clutch and that’s what we really need right now. At the same time there’s room for improvement, and fortunately we have next week at the Ivy League Match Play to improve.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two years ago, Harvard football coach Tim Murphy said he believed Cornell quarterback Jeff Mathews, then a sophomore, would be at least a third round NFL draft pick. After Saturday’s game, there was no reason for Murphy to change his mind.
Mathews, now a senior and a legitimate NFL prospect, carried the Big Red offense on his shoulders all day long. He threw for 472 yards, the most a quarterback has ever passed for in a single game against Harvard.
Despite his valiant efforts, the Crimson (4-0, 2-0 Ivy) had the last word at Schoellkopf Field in Ithaca, New York, winning by a score of 34-24.
But that doesn’t take anything away from the performance of Mathews. Through his passing and scrambling, Mathews accounted for all but one of Cornell’s (1-3, 0-2) total yards. The senior also threw for two touchdowns and rushed for another.
“If I’m a General Manager, I’d draft that guy in the top couple rounds,” Murphy said. “No question about it. You get to a point where you know they’re passing on every down, but he still completes balls. Just amazing.”
It was a dominant aerial performance by any standard. Mathews showed he could thread the needle over the middle, find a streaking receiver down the sideline, and escape from a collapsing pocket to scramble for a gain.
Both of Mathews’ touchdown passes came out of a shotgun set the Big Red threw at Harvard all game. On the first drive of the second half, Mathews fired a bullet into the middle of the end zone that his sliding receiver reeled in for the score.
On the very next drive, Mathews capped a 12 play, 75-yard drive by finding Lucas Shapiro on a seven-yard in route between a trio of Harvard defenders. The strike brought Cornell within three.
“We believe in our guys, and we believe in our pass protection,” Mathews said. “They’re a team that is more geared to stop the run, and we felt we had matchups in the pass game.”
THE DRIVE THAT CHANGED THE GAME
Mathews wasn’t the only quarterback who showed up to play on Saturday. For the second week in a row, the Crimson offense—this time under the direction of senior quarterback Michael Pruneau—made plays when it mattered most.
With just over six minutes remaining, Harvard found itself clinging to a three-point lead. Mathews and the Big Red offense had just marched down the field for a touchdown that got the crowd on its feet.
But Pruneau, who filled in for injured junior starter Conner Hempel, responded in turn. The senior completed two straight passes to sophomore receiver Andrew Fischer and senior tight end Tyler Ott to move the ball into Cornell territory.
Two plays later on a critical third down, Pruneau rose to the occasion and found a diving Ricky Zorn over the middle to move the chains.
It would take just one more play to cap the drive off. Rolling to his right, Pruneau lofted a pass in the direction of senior tight end Cam Brate, who created enough separation in the front corner of the end zone to haul the touchdown pass in.
Just four minutes earlier, the game hung in the balance. But a series of Pruneau completions late effectively put the game out of reach.
“We called a play that was designed for Cam,” Pruneau said. “It was a little double move. We’re actually roommates, so it was great to connect with him after so much that’s happened in the past couple years.”
Pruneau would finish the game 23-of-29 for a career-high 340 yards in the air, throwing for two touchdowns and running for another.
TEAM DEFENSIVE EFFORT
The game belonged to Mathews, but the win ultimately went to Harvard. Much of the credit for the outcome goes to the Crimson defense.
Cornell made it a one possession game several times, but the Harvard defense held up and got the ball back in the hands of its offense, never surrendering the lead.
With Mathews passing out of the shotgun formation nearly every snap, the Crimson typically elected to keep defenders in pass coverage.
This defensive set paid off the most when the driving Cornell offense had the ball on the Harvard 22 partway through the fourth quarter. After Crimson pressure forced Mathews to scramble out of the pocket, senior defensive back Reynaldo Kirton read the pass over the middle and came up with a crucial interception.
“I shouldn’t have made that throw,” Mathews said. “You kind of get caught up in the game and you want to make every play.”
In the first quarter, sophomore linebacker Eric Medes recorded the first interception of his career with a leaping, fingertip catch.
The Crimson defense also recorded six sacks on the day, with four coming from senior defensive tackle Nnamdi Obukwelu and his brother Obum, a junior.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Saturday’s matchup didn’t seem like a fair battle. When the Harvard football team came running onto Schoellkopf Field, four offensive starters—quarterback Conner Hempel, running back Zach Boden, and offensive tackles Anthony Fabiano and Parker Sebastian—had one thing in common: all were dressed in warm-ups.
Comparing a backup quarterback who had never started a collegiate game leading an injury-riddled offense with the one-man show of Cornell’s offense seemed like matching David against Goliath.
After all, Goliath—Jeff Mathews, Cornell’s third-year starting quarterback—was entering his 33rd game starting and had just become the Ivy League’s all-time leading passer.
Even behind a relatively inexperienced offensive line that was going through injuries of its own, Mathews had nearly reached 1,000 passing yards in just three games. With numerous accolades and Ancient Eight records already under his belt, the senior seemed a lock for Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year.
In contrast, David—Hempel’s backup, Michael Pruneau—was on the road, facing his first career start after missing all of his junior season with a torn ACL. Pruneau saw some playing time last week against Holy Cross when Hempel came out of the game with a hyperextended knee, but his performance was unimpressive—he totaled just 49 yards in the two quarters that he played.
Part of that was due to an offensive line that had lost both its starting right and left tackle. Pruneau was going to have to throw behind a line that gave up six sacks in Worcester. With the knee still bothering Hempel, Pruneau was given the reins again.
By all accounts, Goliath should have crushed David. And maybe if it was simply Mathews v. Pruneau, it might have been a knockout.  It certainly seemed like it might be that way when Harvard’s first drive ended with Pruneau throwing the ball into the arms of Big Red corner Michael Turner.
But college football is not, as Jeff Mathews found out the hard way on Saturday, a one-man show.  As it had in the previous three games, the Harvard defense came up big in the first half to keep the Crimson in the game while the offense was sputtering.
Mathews appeared to be picking apart the secondary—until he came close to the prize. Despite finding the red zone three times before halftime, the Big Red came away with just three points, courtesy of one missed field goal and another blocked. When Cornell came near the end zone, it was as though Mathews’ field shrank and the passing imbalance became amplified.
But once the third quarter began, the Cornell offense—which appeared to be made up entirely of Mathews and his receiving corps—clicked. Mathews connected with receivers on back-to-back 75-yard drives for scores to pull within three.
Then Mathews made a costly mistake. Trying to force the ball to a receiver inside Harvard’s 10-yard line, Mathews threw it up and Crimson safety Reynaldo Kirton snatched it out of the air.
Later, Mathews would say that he shouldn’t have made that pass, but by that point, he was the only one of the Big Red creating any offense. Even when the Crimson knew that Cornell was almost certainly going to throw the ball, Mathews would scramble out of a pocket that continually collapsed around him and make heroic throw after heroic throw to keep the Big Red in the game.
By the end of the game, the player who Harvard coach Tim Murphy describes as one who he “would draft in the first couple of rounds [of the NFL draft]” had hit 472 yards passing, the most ever recorded against a Harvard defense, and two scores.
And yet, Cornell came out on the losing end of another battle. Because where Pruneau could look to players like tailback Paul Stanton to pick up the slack when he hadn’t yet found his rhythm, there was nobody supplementing Mathews. Of the Big Red’s 457 total offensive yardage, he was responsible for a whopping 456.
Each piece of the puzzle that was Harvard’s team played a part in the win. There was the defense, which picked off Mathews twice and took away any run game that Cornell had. There was the special teams unit, which blocked a field goal and for the most part ensured that the Big Red had the length of the field to travel. And there was the offense, which finally came together as a cohesive unit in the second half, when Pruneau passed for 200 yards and two touchdowns.
For Cornell, Mathews seemed to be the only functioning piece of the puzzle. He wasn’t flawless. But as leader of a team that totaled negative 15 rushing yards and playing with a defense that gave up over 40 points in its last two games, there was nothing more Mathews could have done to try to win this game. And so, David triumphed once again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In their third matchup of the season Friday night, the Harvard men’s water polo team (9-8, 7-1 CWPA Northern) put Brown (12-9, 5-1 CWPA Northern) back on its heels in Providence, R.I.
The Crimson looked to continue its five-game win streak coming off of a 16-5 win over Connecticut College, and accomplished its goal with a 12-10 victory against the Bears.
Sophomore Noah Harrison, freshman Joey Colton, and sophomore Ben Zepfel led Harvard with a hat-trick each, and Harrison and Colton both added 3 assists. Colton came away from the game with 2 steals as well.
The teams came into the game evenly matched, each having lost once and won once against each other.  In the most recent contest, the Crimson beat Brown, 6-5.
But Harvard was not about to let its most recent win over the Bears get to its head.
“We have to respect them regardless of the results of the past few times we played them,” Harrison said.
By halftime, Brown and the Crimson were tied at three.
“We stuck to our game plan,” Harrison said,  “But they put up a hell of a fight.”
The third quarter turned out to be the deciding factor.  Harvard exploded in an exciting show of offensive power, netting five goals.
“That’s when the offense really opened up,” Harrison said.  “We really started to get into our groove.”
Sophomore goalie Colin Woolway attributes some of the goals to players on the perimeter.
“We had drives through the middle of the pool,” Woolway said.  “We were able to open up space for our shooters on the outside.”
He also gives the centers credit for helping create offense.
“Ben Zepfel and John Holland-McCowan are really good at holding space,” Woolway said.  “Brown was dropping in on them a bit, but it opened up opportunities for our players to drive through and be wide-open for a goal.”
But the defensive line’s performance is not to be overlooked.
 
“Our defense was really solid,” Woolway said.  “We pressed really hard and tried to make it difficult for them to move the ball around and make it difficult for them to get into the flow of their offense.  That was probably the main thing.” 
In the fourth quarter, both the Bears and the Crimson scored four times; Brown tied up the game for the second time, making the score 8-8.
“They had a big crowd there, and the crowd helped them get back into it,” Woolway said.  “They were able to score one goal very early on in the fourth quarter, and then they scored another one [to tie it up].”
Woolway described the scenario as similar to the one that occurred the last time Harvard played Brown in its pool: “We were up two going into the fourth quarter, and then their crowd got really into it and they ended up scoring a couple of goals and beating us [in the prior match].”
But the Crimson emerged on top due to the two goals it was able to put in the cage during the intense third quarter.
“[The match] was a lot of exchanging goals,” Woolway said.  “They kept fighting the whole game.  We went up on them, but they kept clawing their way back.”
Harvard, although never on the losing side, was never ahead in the game by three goals.
“Our coach was describing them as wounded animal (having come off of a few hard losses recently),” Harrison said.  “We have to really respect them, because they’re going to come out and leave everything in the pool, and they did that.  My hats go off to them; they’re a really good team.”
The Crimson, however, was able to collect itself and restore dominance in the last quarter.
“Viktor Wrobel had the goal that I would say sealed the game.  We were up 11-10 with a minute left.  We had a 6-on-5,” Woolway said.  "[Wrobel] was on the left side and was able to score.”
Three other Harvard players also added goals to assure the Crimson the win.
Harvard will travel across town this Wednesday, Oct. 16, to play MIT in what promises to be another competitive contest. The Crimson already beat the Engineers, 13-10, on Sept. 29.
“MIT is another team we also have to respect,” Harrison said. “I think we can beat them, but we have to come in mentally prepared and focused and ready to give it our all.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s tennis team traveled down South this weekend to take on some top teams as it continued its fall season at the Texas A&M Conference Challenge in College Station, Texas.
The Crimson, which has already hosted highly ranked opponents from around the country and faced its Ivy rivals this fall, faced two new top squads this weekend.
Harvard took on the Aggies, who finished last year ranked No. 14 nationally and advanced to the Sweet 16 in the NCAA Championships, and Illinois, who reached the second round in those same championships.
“All in all, it was a terrific trip,” Harvard coach Dave Fish ’72 said. “The players saw some competition that was a level up, and came away thinking they have every reason to be able to play at that level. We played some good matches, and did well.”
The tournament was originally scheduled to run all weekend, but Sunday’s matches were canceled due both to rain and the Crimson’s travel plans. The Challenge consisted of one round of singles and two rounds of doubles on Friday, followed by a round of each on Saturday.
In the matches that were played, Harvard faced some tough tests against strong teams. The Crimson finished 12-15 overall, with a 6-6 mark in doubles.
In Saturday’s action, Harvard had success in both singles and doubles. The Crimson’s top doubles tandem of co-captain Casey MacMaster and junior Denis Nguyen, who are ranked 20th in the nation, upset the Illini’s tenth-ranked Ross Guignon and Tim Kopinski, 8-7(4). The freshman duo of Sebastian Beltrame and Andrew Ball took an 8-3 win, and the team of freshman Brian Yeung and sophomore Nicky Hu beat the No. 12 team in the country in Texas A&M’s Shane Vinsant and Harrison Adams, 8-7(2).
Last year’s No. 3 squad of junior Alex Steinroeder and sophomore Kelvin Lam lost, 8-5. In singles, Nguyen had another strong showing, downing the 17th-ranked player in Illinois’ Jared Hiltzik, 4-6, 7-5, 6-4. Beltrame, who won his singles flight at the Ivy Plus Invitational, took a three-set win over Vinsant, the No. 56 player in the country. Connor Haughey and Lam also picked up wins for Harvard.
“We put Sebastian Beltrame at No. 2 because he’s been playing so well,” Fish said. “He came back strong on Saturday and beat a highly ranked player [Vinsant], which was a pleasant surprise for us. Sebastian is doing great, and so are all the freshmen.”
Some of the squad had a rougher time. Hu lost, 6-1, 6-1, and Yeung fell, 6-1, 6-2. Ball rebounded from losing a 6-0 first set, but fell in three.
On Friday, the Crimson played well in doubles, but posted just a 2-7 record in singles.
Nguyen and MacMaster continued to prove they are one of the top teams in the country, defeating No. 12 Vinsant and Adams, 8-7(6). Steinroeder and Lam took an 8-6 victory over the Aggies’ Behzad Minavi and Tito Moreiras. Yeung and Hu fell, 8-2, and Beltrame and Haughey lost, 8-4.
But by the time singles rolled around, the team came out flat after struggling in the Texas heat.
“The heat was hard for a lot of guys to get used to,” Fish said. We haven’t been playing after that. So after a few hours of doubles, the guys started their singles matches. Some of the guys pretty much wilted by their third sets.”
Only the freshmen Ball and Yeung won their matches. Yeung came back against the Illini’s Blake Bazarnik for a 2-6, 7-6(5), 6-3 win. Steinroeder, Lam, and Beltrame lost in three sets, while Haughey and Hu went down handily. Nguyen played the No. 11 team in the country, Texas A&M’s Jeremy Efferding, close, but ultimately fell, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3.
Despite some strong matches, facing top competition proved to the team that it still has much to work on to round into midseason form.
“Doubles is something we just have to keep focusing on in practice,” Steinroeder said. “For singles, we need to keep making the points longer, and be as physical as those top teams are. They don’t miss and just keep the points going…we can learn from that.”
After concluding one of its biggest tournaments of the fall season, Harvard will get no rest. Next weekend, the Crimson will return to New Haven for the ITA Northeast Regionals, where it will face its Ancient Eight rivals as well as other northeastern schools.
“Regionals is a fun tournament for everyone,” Steinroeder said. “It’ll be fun to play all of the other Ivies again to see how we stack up. Going down to Texas A&M was a good confidence builder for us, and I think everyone will be prepared this weekend.”

While most of us enjoyed extra hours of sleep, food, and revelry on Monday, in the fifteenth century the native Taino people of Hispaniola did not enjoy being enslaved, forcibly converted to Christianity, and wiped out by disease. Yes, brave New World explorer or not, Christopher Columbus was kind of a jerk. In recognition of this fact, several Harvard student groups have lobbied against Harvard’s continuing observance of Columbus Day and advocated for its replacement by the more politically correct “Indigenous Peoples Day.”But what if we do want to celebrate a specific hero of history on our day off? To whom should we turn? Unfortunately, many historical figures venerated by fourth grade social studies books still managed to be blockheads in their own way. Martin Luther King was probably an adulterer, Thomas Jefferson almost certainly had a kid with one of his slaves, and before he started his own line of tee shirts, Che Guevara is said to have beaten people with baseball bats.
Given that nobody is perfect, here are some different historical people that it might be worth celebrating instead of Columbus (until someone finds an awful fact about one of them and disqualifies them, too).
 
Ashoka the Great
This ruler of the Mauryan Empire (which stretched across most of the Indian subcontinent) in the second century BCE turned away from bloodthirsty conquest after the siege of Kalinga, in which over 100,000 people were killed. After realizing the awful effects on the friends and family of the deceased, Ashoka was overcome with regret and sadness, subsequently converting to Buddhism and spreading a doctrine of nonviolence throughout the empire. Duly noted: this conversion came conveniently after he had already amassed a gigantic empire, but we’ll let that slide for the sake of “better late than never.”
 
Whoever invented the Internet
The ability to instantaneously access email, Wikipedia, and videos of kittens has enhanced the lives of billions of people worldwide. While we could simply create this holiday to honor our illustrious alumnus Al Gore '69, he already has a Nobel Peace Prize and would probably be in favor of spreading the wealth around by sharing this honor with his collaborators at UCLA and DARPA.
 
Abraham Lincoln
Why does this guy not have his own holiday? Fun fact: before we started calling the third Monday in February “Presidents’ Day,” both George Washington’s and Abraham Lincoln’s February birthdays were considered separate holidays. Yes, yes, there are good presidents besides these two, but the homogenizing name “Presidents’ Day” seems to make them all equal, and some are more equal than others. Are we really expected to celebrate Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter alongside the man who freed the slaves, gave the Gettysburg Address, and managed to be a vampire hunter at the same time?
Malala Yousafzai
By the time they reach age 16, most teenagers can tout a list of accomplishments that includes an album of “artsy” nature pictures on iPhoto, a date to homecoming, and their baking-soda-and-vinegar volcano in the sixth grade. By age 12, Malala Yousafzai had started blogging for the BBC about her life in the Swat Valley of Pakistan, where Taliban extremists had taken over and banned girls' education. She soon became an outspoken activist for female education, a courageous stand which led to an assassination attempt by the Taliban in which she received a bullet wound to the head while riding on a school bus. But this 16-year-old is unstoppable, and having survived the attack she remains as vocal and insistent an advocate for human rights as ever.
 
Alas, we continue to celebrate a man with a pointy hat and mixed legacy of continental conquest...
