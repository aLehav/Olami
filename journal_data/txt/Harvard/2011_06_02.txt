After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yale will establish a Naval Reserve Officers’ Training Corps unit on its campus and begin accepting cadets in fall of 2012, bringing ROTC’s four decade absence to an end, Yale announced last week.
Secretary of the Navy Ray E. Mabus and Yale University President Richard C. Levin signed an agreement to establish an NROTC unit in which students from Yale and other local colleges will be able to participate.
“The new Navy ROTC unit at Yale continues the University's proud tradition of educating students who serve our country's armed forces," Levin said in a statement. "From Lexington to Afghanistan, our students and graduates have contributed to the nation's defense, and the return of NROTC will make it easier for the most talented young men and women who aspire to leadership in our military to gain a Yale education."
Yale’s decision follows Harvard's recognition of NROTC in March, after the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”—the policy that banned gays and lesbians from serving openly in the military.
Many have said that Harvard’s decision to recognize ROTC would influence other institutions to follow.
Harvard Kennedy School professor David R. Gergen said at the March signing ceremony in Loeb House that he believed that Harvard’s recognition is “likely to have a ripple effect across the nation.”
In April, the faculties of both Stanford and Columbia voted to recognize ROTC for the first time since the Vietnam War era.
However,  Yale’s establishment of its own unit “one-ups” Harvard—though ROTC will be officially recognized by Harvard, cadets  will continue to complete many aspects of their training at MIT. Yale students who  participated in ROTC to this point have often had to travel over an hour to  the University of Connecticut or other universities—and there was no  Naval ROTC in the state.
"The renewal of a formal relationship with Yale will serve to bring dozens of new and talented officers who will carry on Yale's tradition of service into the Navy and Marine Corps each year," Mabus said.
Due to the military's costs and the limited interest in ROTC among  Harvard students, it remains unlikely that Harvard will get its own unit  in the near future. In 2010-2011, only about 20 Harvard undergrads are  enrolled in MIT’s ROTC program.
Despite the burdens of ROTC participation, two Yale seniors were commissioned as US Air Force second lieutenants this spring.
Yale “hopes to enhance its affiliation with Air Force ROTC even as it welcomes Naval ROTC back to its campus,” according to the statement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Relations between Harvard and the neighboring city of Allston remain tense after residents and a neighborhood task force called on the University to not begin any construction projects in Allston while work on the Science Complex—a $1 billion development project—continues to be stalled.
The latest expressions of discontent came at a Wednesday meeting of the Harvard Allston Task Force, a group of neighborhood residents appointed by the City of Boston to give Harvard feedback on its development projects. At the meeting, the University presented designs for a Business School construction project called Tata Hall.
Though a few residents were dissatisfied with the design of the building, many more objected to the project due to Harvard’s prior construction and development efforts in Allston.
"Personally, I can't support this project not because of any particular demerits—though we've heard some—but because this developer has dirty hands," said Task Force member and neighborhood resident Brent Whelan '73 . "They've paralyzed development in our community."
Harvard halted construction on the Allston Science Complex, envisioned as a mecca for stem cell research, in Dec. 2009 due to financial constraints brought on by the economic recession. But last fall, the Business School announced that it would construct Tata Hall—which will house classrooms and living accommodations for professionals in its executive education program—after receiving $50 million from Tata Trusts and Companies, the philanthropic arm of India’s Tata Group, a large Indian conglomerate.
“It is time for this community to stand solid and say no more,” community member Ed A. Kotomori added to much applause. “No more buildings, no more plans. It's got to stop now.”
Task Force member Harry E. Mattison echoed Whelan's sentiments and said that Harvard should make good on its "broken promises" before embarking on another construction project—receiving applause as well from many of those in attendance.
Kevin A. McCluskey '76, Harvard's senior director of community relations with Boston, said that the Unviersity has achieved many of the short term goals, such as leasing Harvard’s vacant property, set when construction was halted in 2009. McCluskey added that the University is still in the process of analyzing its position in Allston and charting a path forward.
The Harvard Allston Work Team’s mid-2011 recommendations—which will suggest strategies for resuming construction in Allston—will be released later this month, according to Work Team Co-Chair Bill Purcell. The Work Team, a fourteen person group comprising Harvard deans and other faculty, has spent the past year and a half speaking to residents, development consultants, and other experts in order to formulate a strategy for how to proceed with the development.
Wednesday’s meeting was intended to focus on Tata Hall, but residents’ comments shifted the discussion to Harvard’s overall relationship with the community.
Several attendees said that they feel that Harvard has excluded Allston residents from its planning process, a complaint often voiced by residents.
“This project should be tabled, and we should wait until [Harvard] is willing to address this community's actual concerns,” Whelan said. “The Allston community needs to be invited to the table to talk about more development, not to be informed of it. How many times have they done this before?”
At the meeting, architects presented the Task Force with a three-dimensional model of the Business School's campus that included a rendering of the projected plans for Tata Hall. Task Force member and community member Bruce E. Houghton said that the model—which he claimed left out the walls surrounding the Business School—was reflective of what he characterized as Harvard’s general attitude of disregarding community input and needs.
He likened them to the Berlin Wall, saying, “Take down your walls, Mr. Gorbachev. Take down your Berlin walls, Harvard.”
Despite the anger that characterized the meeting, as it drew to a close some residents and Task Force members expressed a reluctant acquiescence to the construction.
“The building's already done and planned,” Houghton said. “There's been no inclusiveness. What can we do?”
