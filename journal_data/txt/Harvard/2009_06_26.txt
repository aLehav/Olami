After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW YORK, N.Y. — BookExpo America didn’t seem like the dregs of a dying industry. BEA, North America’s largest convention of publishers, authors, and printers, looked like the biggest book fair I’d ever seen: miles of aisles, spanning 22 acres, spread over 16 hours.
But it’s no secret publishing is in trouble. The cookbook author in the booth next to ours, a 25-year BEA veteran, said the massive convention used to be much bigger not too long ago. Certainly, publishers made several efforts at the conference to tackle technology, print publications’ number-one challenge: Agents ran around trying to find “mobile partners” that could transform their books into apps on your favorite brand of cell phone; BEA itself hosted presentations such as “Book Bloggers—Today’s Buzz Builders” and “Twitter for (Book-Industry) Dummies.”
Yet something was missing. My colleagues and I at Let’s Go—the Harvard student–run travel guide—had no publishing friends our own age. The lack of new blood at BEA was disappointing—not because adults can’t get with the times, but because the older generation feels a need to reconcile these new times with the old, the safe, and the familiar. 
At the presentations, in an effort to save the businesses that built BEA, some authors all but owned up to writing based on what they thought Google wanted to hear. Such surrender commits a fatal conflation: the goal of saving the print business itself with the goal of saving the stories it tells (the real reason the business began in the first place). 
Unlike most adults, our generation is unafraid to jettison old vehicles for delivering those stories just because they worked in the past. At this novel point in time, publishing needs to start on a new page. Only the young can fully accept that—to those who are entering the industry for the first time, it’s a new page no matter what. Publishers should be forced to make this leap of blind faith into an uncertain technological world, because that faith, the creed of words, is so important.
The publishing industry is dying for (a lack of) young people and unbiased idea(l)s necessary to reboot the system in this way. Those of us who are considering careers there should only be inspired by the frightening thought that the industry could soon go under. Publishing needs us, if only for the reminder: The pages exist for the words, not the other way around.Nathaniel S.

COCA, Ecuador — Over the canopy to the south, Ivan, a Quichua Indian, has spotted three macaws in flight. Moments later, binoculars train to a pair of white-throated toucans, and my group murmurs in excitement. The next item noted by our guide Oscar, however, is not a rare bird, deep in the Amazon rainforest: “Over there, the government has authorized a new, private highway from the coast to here.”  
Standing in a metal tower 120 feet over the grounds of Sacha Lodge (an ecotourism jungle lodge down the Napo River from Coca, Ecuador), signs of human occupation and exploitation do not blemish the horizon. Yet, even at this special refuge within the Amazon, Ecuador’s approaching crossroads looms, a shadow over its mostly optimistic outlook. On the motored canoe ride from Coca to the lodge, several major worksites reveal the presence of oil operations in the region; barges laden with trucks drift by. Oil has been instrumental in Ecuador’s expanding economy, but pursuit of petroleum increasingly puts at risk the country’s most vast and irreplaceable resource—the rainforest.
Coca itself evokes an American western boomtown, with the equivalent of saloons and other entertainment for the Halliburton or Texaco employee looking to blow off steam. Across from the canoe dock stands a large military casino, funded by—no surprise—oil. A large amount of oil revenue (the local guides claim 40 percent) is funneled directly into Ecuador’s large military.
With such a reliance on developing oil revenue, Ecuador recognizes that its miles of jungle face unprecedented risk. The planned highway linking the Pacific Ocean to the Napo River will cause damage hard to assess before it strikes. With the large variability and low populations that characterize Amazon eco-systems, separating already-disperse species will have serious consequences.
As a somber mood descends upon our canopy-watchers, however, the guides explain that Ecuador recognizes this threat and wants to protect its forests. Without nearly the requisite funding, however, it has implored the international community to provide help. Germany has volunteered to lead this charge, but other countries—such as the United States—must join the effort if the jungles of Ecuador are to survive.

BRIDGEPORT, Conn. — Into purgatorial fire, the United States District Court of Connecticut must cast one of two souls, the state government or the Catholic Church. The Office of State Ethics accuses the Church of breaking Connecticut’s lobbying rules last spring when the Diocese of Bridgeport protested liberal legislation. Distraught, the diocese seeks clemency and asks the court to prohibit OSE from applying these rules to the Church. To quench this inferno, the state legislature should exempt churches from its lobbying rules—because churchgoers aren’t powerbrokers.
Mercy the bureaucracy denies, for the Church committed a cardinal sin: It didn’t follow procedure. Last March, the diocese spent over $2,000 busing people to a rally in Hartford, where Catholics protested a bill that would have stripped pastors of control over parish finances. In April, the Church again trespassed. On its website, the diocese announced its opposition to a bill that legalized gay marriage and spurred parishioners to “contact your legislator.” OSE christened these three words “lobbying” and warned the diocese against further misbehavior.
Technically, OSE is right. Connecticut law defines lobbying as “communicating directly or soliciting others to communicate with any official…for the purpose of influencing any legislative [action].” A person who spends over $2,000 on “lobbying” per year must register with OSE before he squawks. He also must file financial reports regularly and submit to random audits by OSE. That miscreant who fails to register faces fines worth up to $10,000. In this case, that miscreant was the Church.
But by following the letter of the law, OSE is violating the spirit of the law. Connecticut’s lobbying rules intend to shed light on backroom deals, not public protests. And the five firms that the Church uses to lobby the legislature are already registered with OSE. In its defense, OSE says it wants transparency, but it’s hard to miss 3,500 people standing in front of the state Capitol. The legislature already exempts the media from these rules to protect free speech. It should do the same with churches to preserve religious freedom.
Lobbying rules like these stifle speech of all faiths. Clergy fear voicing their views on legislation if it means opening their books to investigation. OSE says it looks at only the portion of church finances dedicated to lobbying. But to distinguish that portion is impossible. Do we count the homily, the bulletin, the prayer group? State Representative Chris Caruso, an unsympathetic Catholic, chides the Church to “Give unto Caesar, what is Caesar’s.” But the Church’s everyday finances are none of Caesar’s business.
OSE should drop all charges against the Church, and the legislature should revise the rules immediately. We don’t need to register every person marching outside the pearly gates, just the guy trying to slip Saint Peter a few coins. Moreover, it would help both church and state if a court didn’t settle every dispute. Otherwise, we may see the day when the penitent Catholic, at the start of Confession, instead of saying “Bless me Father, for I have sinned,” demands, “Bless me Father, or I’ll sue!”

ROME, Italy — “You know, America was founded by prudes,” Cooper Harris tells Scott Thomas in Eurotrip. “Prudes who left Europe because they hated all the kinky, steamy European sex that was going on.” 
While I hate to contradict the film that brought America “Here’s a fun fact: you made out with your sister,” I’m afraid I have to report from Rome that some Italians are not too pleased with some of the “kinky, steamy European sex” that Silvio Berlusconi, Italy’s Prime Minister, may or may not have taken part in.  
I am writing, of course, about the Berlusconi sex scandal that has been all over the Italian papers since the end of April.  Berlusconi is alleged to have had an inappropriate relationship with an 18 year-old aspiring show-girl, Napoli’s Noemi Letizia.  
The scandal began when it was reported that the prime minister attended the high school student’s 18th birthday party and gave her a $10,000 necklace. A few days later Veronica Laria, Berlusconi’s wife of 19 years, told the Italian press that she was filing for divorce because of her husband’s dalliances with young women, citing in particular his bizarre relationship with Letizia.  Earlier this month, the scandal really took off: Photographs came out in the Spanish newspaper, El Pais, which depicted nude guests (including Mirek Toplanek, the former Czech prime minister) at a party that Berlusconi had hosted at Villa Certosa last summer. Then on Thursday the Italian press reported that Berlusconi allegedly paid female escorts to go to dinner parties with him.
Berlusconi has denied it all.  He says that his relationship with Letizia has only ever been appropriate and his parties innocent.  And no, he has never paid for companionship.  He adds that he cannot even have sex, due to an operation he had on his prostate.  The prime minister claims that these false attacks have been launched by his enemies; in particular, he blames the left for trying to undermine him right before the EU elections, which took place at the beginning of the month, and the upcoming G8 conference, which will be held in L’Aquila in July.  
Indeed, the scandal has had political consequences. While Mr. Belusconi’s approval rating remains above 50 percent, his party, the PdL (Popolo della Liberta—People of Liberty) did not do nearly as well as predicted in the recent EU elections.  Berlusconi had anticipated that the party would receive 40 percent of the vote, but in fact it only accrued 35 percent.  Berlusconi himself has admitted that the scandal has damaged Italy’s reputation.
Now, let’s be clear about something, I don’t favor a lot of Berlusconi’s policy, but I have to agree with him here: What politicians do in their bedrooms is, frankly, none of the public’s business.  My internship requires that I read the Italian papers daily and follow the wires from ANSA (Italy’s version of the AP). While I enjoy this part of my job, I do not want to read anymore about the Italian prime minister’s prostate.  As long as he is having consensual sexual relations (nb: the age of consent in Italy is 16), I do not really care who he is or is not having them with.  And I certainly don’t think sex should be political. 
There is real news in Italy: Ghadaffi came to Rome to visit Berlusconi, the G8 conference is coming to L’Aquila, and just a few days ago there was another earthquake in the medieval city, unemployment in Europe is at an all-time high, and voter-turnout in Italy is low.  Why waste ink on Berlusconi’s philandering? Let his wife’s divorce lawyer deal with that.  There are plenty of policy issues that the left could use to attack Berlusconi, but let’s leave sex out of this. Seriously, Italy, don’t be such a prude—that’s America’s job.

NORTH POINT, Hong Kong — Eels swim in Styrafoam boxes, astonished dead fish shine in rows next to blocks of pink-white flesh, silver heads. A live fish flails on the counter. There are clams in purple shells, small octopi, and other sea creatures already mashed into balls for soup. Lengths of meat dangle in butcher shops, knuckled feet still attached, shoppers’ chattering punctuated by cleaver’s thud.
These, and other stores displaying dragon fruit, swollen cherries, apples from Washington state, purple yams, or cases of white noodles and buns, plastic bottles of cooking oil stacked in glistening towers, or loose tea leaves and nuts in glass jars, are obscured by the stalls in the middle of the street. On weekend mornings, vendors set up in the road to sell t-shirts, watches, handbags, jelly sandals, shoes, tailored prom dresses, ties, lingerie, tablecloths. 
Traffic is mostly pedestrian, except for the occasional van and the double-decker tram that winds down Chun Yeung Street, stopping at 7-11 at one end and the footbridge at the other. When I get back to my apartment at night, the market is closing down. The ground is usually wet, from Hong Kong summer rains or from hosing fish pieces and meat trimmings into the gutter. 
The man I bought a purse from last week smiles, and I grin back. Welcome home.

SANTIAGO, Chile —After 13 hours of flying to Santiago (complete with rowdy representatives from Wal-Mart and the equally vociferous and offensively twangy producers of the “Redneck Roadshow”), the prospect of making broken conversation in my broken Spanish with my Chilean host family proved unappealing.
I mainly cheered ¡sí! or ¡bueno! to their questions, giving an occasional laugh. Finally, I caught a question about having a glass of something and primitively signaled my thirst with a quick head nod. Claudia, my host mother, explained what she was giving me. It resembled lemonade, so I pretended to understand and took a huge swig.
Oh. Oh my. 
“Qué es esto?”
“Pisco sour,” Claudia responded.
This thing was stronger than many a freshman Rubinoff concoction. It was a Sunday. It was also 11 AM. Maybe. 
My aloof nodding has led me into similar situations thus far. I spent the weekend at a rustic pottery village, when I thought my family was merely taking me out to lunch. I thought I was going out for a customary, jovial carrete with my host brother, but realized I had misunderstood the night’s plans when someone started shaving his leg. He returned home with a (real) homemade calf tattoo, inked on a friend’s twin bed.
Maybe there’s nothing wrong with uttering a meek “no entiendo” here and there.
Translation? I don’t understand.

LONDON, England — I experienced the comfort of home before I stepped into my house, or even laid foot on airport tarmac. It was on the plane, catered by stewardesses who offered wine with my meal in a tone of calm civility clearly distinguishable from the intimately friendly manners I had encountered before boarding at Logan. As we swooped over streets that represent personal landmarks and brim with familiar memories, the pilot apologized profusely for the offending view of Arsenal stadium. Naturally, given Arsenal football team’s recent defeat by Chelsea rival, I presumed these were the words of a gloating Chelsea fan. Despite supporting an altogether different team—Tottenham—I nonetheless empathized with the pilot due to Tottenham and Arsenal’s natural animosity, and so willingly joined in scorning our mutual enemy. 	
Set in contrast to my time in Boston, where I have just about figured out that Red Sox means baseball, my appreciation for the generally unacknowledged pleasure of shared context was quite tremendous.
There is such security in familiar cultural references - those passing comments that so naturally pepper conversations, but that I only began to notice in the foreign context of Harvard, where casual allusions are strange and alien. In London, stripped of my “English” accent, I escape the differences cultivated by national culture, and revolve in a landscape that—compared to eternally confusing America—seems to reflect my every perception.
Yet as I re-connect with old friends who compare my school life to “American Pie” (the English equivalent, I suppose, of Americans who compare my home life to Hogwarts), I once again experience that insurmountable inability to ever accurately conjure an impression of life on the other side of the pond. Just as no amount of description will ever summon the myriad of associations attached to North West London, my friends at home are forever unable to truly understand such foreign concepts as proctors or sororities.
Strangely enough, these communication difficulties only reinforce my decision to have studied in another country. The impossibility of neatly fitting my life into one box, with one fully comprehensive circle of friends shows that, in a sense, I have access to two worlds.  My life in the United States allows me to question the assumptions that Londoners, by nature, take for granted, and the breadth of perspectives at Harvard becomes apparent upon my return home.
For now, though, in the name of a relaxing summer, I allow the confines of my world to stretch from Brick Lane to Hampstead. It’s broad enough.

New York City resident Jabrai Jordan Copney, 20, one of the three men alleged to have been involved in the drug-related shooting death of Justin Cosby in Kirkland House last month, was indicted late Thursday night by a grand jury on charges that include first degree murder and armed robbery. 
Copney, who turned himself in to authorities at the Cambridge Police Station on May 21, was also formally charged last night with accessory after the fact of murder, attempt to commit a crime, and possession of a firearm, according to Middlesex District Attorney Gerry Leone. 
The day after his arrest, Copney was arraigned in Cambridge District Court on the same charges as the was ones he was indicted for last night, except without the counts of armed robbery and attempt to commit a crime. At that arraignment, he pleaded not guilty and was ordered held without bail.
Jessica Venezia, a spokeswoman for the District Attorney's office, said she would defer comment about why the charges have expanded until after Copney's arraignment in superior court, for which a date has not yet been scheduled. She said that last night's indictment was necessary for Copney to be tried in superior court, the highest court that he would be arraigned in, and that no indictment had been needed for the earlier hearing in the lower court. 
Copney is the first of two men arrested so far in connection with the shooting, which took place on the afternoon of May 18. The second man, Blayn "Bliz" Jiggetts, 20, of Mount Vernon, New York, was arrested on June 9 by Massachusetts State Police in Harlem.
The following day, Jiggetts refused at his court appearance to voluntarily return to Massachusetts to face charges, which included first degree murder and armed robbery. He has since been jailed without bail and will return to Manhattan Criminal Court again on July 8, where prosecutors will likely present a governor's warrant to extradite Jiggetts to Massachusetts to answer for his charges.
Investigators have said that the third man suspected of being involved in the shooting remains at large.
According to prosecutors, Cosby, a Cambridge resident, suffered an apparent gunshot wound to the abdomen during a failed "drug rip" in the Harvard dormitory. He was seen stumbling out of the dorm and was transported to Beth Israel Hospital, where he was pronounced dead the next day. 
Investigations by University, Massachusetts, and Cambridge police have determined that Copney and two other suspects, none of whom were Harvard students, had arranged for and attended the meeting with Cosby. After the shooting, they fled the scene and returned to New York City via bus that evening. Prosecutors say they found $1,000 in cash and a pound of marijuana near Cosby. 
Two Harvard students, Chanequa N. Campbell '09 and Brittany J. Smith '09, are alleged to have given swipe-card access to the victim and suspects, allowing them to enter the basement of the dormitory. Although Campbell, through her lawyer, has denied the allegations and said she does not know the victim, the two students were barred from graduation in late May. 
A Crimson investigation found that Campbell was the subject of a serious disciplinary investigation by the College during her freshman year, although friends have come to her defense and said that it is unlikely she would be involved with any criminal activity.
The statement released by the Middlesex District Attorney's office said that the investigation into the circumstances of the shootings, as well as into those involved in or knowledgeable about the incident, continues. It also noted that the charges pressed on Copney are allegations and that he is presumed innocent until proven guilty.

CORRECTION: An earlier online version of the June 26 article "Suspect in Kirkland Shooting Indicted" incorrectly stated that Jabrai Jordan Copney pleaded guilty at an arraignment in Cambridge last month. In fact, Copney pleaded not guilty, and the text of the article has been updated to reflect the error.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College Library has eliminated over 20 staff positions and cut hours for several other employees as part of the University-wide layoffs announced this past week, according to an e-mail sent to staff by HCL's head librarian Nancy M. Cline.An "all-staff" meeting will be held later this summer to "outline some of the plans for rebuilding HCL" in the wake of the recent reductions, according to Cline's e-mail. She also wrote that associate librarians will visit units in HCL in coming weeks to meet and discuss the changes with staff.A part of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, HCL administers Widener, Lamont, and Cabot Science libraries among others.Laying off employees is only the most recent budget-cutting measure implemented in Harvard's libraries. Administrators decided to convert the Quad library into student social space in order to reduce costs, and House libraries have been forced to trim employment hours and restrict student hiring to meet a mandated 25 percent House budget reduction.The library cuts as well as others in FAS come as a result of a projected $220 million annual deficit by fiscal year 2011. Recent cuts account for only $77 million of that total, which FAS Dean Michael D. Smith says must be eliminated over the next two years.The budget shortfall is the result of an anticipated $125 million reduction in the payout from the University's endowment to FAS by fiscal year 2011, as well as various expenses and structural deficits that have been exacerbated by faculty hiring and capital expansions in FAS earlier in the decade, according to a recent report in Harvard Magazine, which cited statements from Smith.The library system has already eliminated duplicate print subscriptions for digitally available content, centralized technical services, and streamlined staff duties at various research service desks, according to HCL spokeswoman Beth Brainard.Brainard said that she could not say "at this point" which libraries would be hit hardest by the layoffs, offering only that "our work is all interrelated" and "when so many people leave the workforce, it affects everyone." She declined to comment on where HCL's staff reductions would take place and the specific numbers of layoffs in the libraries, or on HCL's participation levels in the University's voluntary early retirement incentive program accepted by over 500 staffers this spring.But she did note that "HCL continues to face a significant deficit" and that "the majority of the positions [becoming] vacant will not be filled."In February, The Crimson reported that Cline had said at a State of the Libraries meeting that HCL's budgeting goal in fiscal year 2010 was to reduce its budget by $12 million, according to an excerpt of an internal HCL news update provided by a library staffer who wished to remain anonymous to preserve their relationship with administrators as layoffs loom.But Brainard yesterday would only say that HCL had been asked to plan for a 15 percent budget cut this coming year, as have other departments throughout FAS. She said the $12 million figure is incorrect, and that both budget numbers and staffing levels have been "in flux."Brainard also flatly denied recent rumors that administrators are considering changing Lamont Library's hours or limiting its accessibility to certain houses as part of HCL's budget cuts.Brainard has come to represent the sole public voice of HCL, with staffers approached by The Crimson in person or over the phone almost unfailingly adhering to the HCL-wide policy of referring any media communications to her. Employees declined to share their personal feelings on the recent cuts as well, and one staffer in Lamont, when prodded by the Crimson for thoughts on the layoffs, quipped that "we're not allowed to have opinions."Harvard College Library oversees the circulation of more than 11 million library items, ranging from maps to films to rare books and manuscripts, and employs over 600 staff members, according to its Web site. The University has combined holdings of over 16 million items in its more than 70 libraries.—Staff writer Peter F. Zhu can be reached at pzhu@fas.harvard.edu.
