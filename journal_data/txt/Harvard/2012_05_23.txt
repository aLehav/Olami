After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Things were not looking up for the Harvard women’s lacrosse team on the night of April 2.
That evening, the University of Virginia handled the Crimson, 12-6, marking Harvard’s second straight loss by at least four goals. The Crimson returned to Cambridge with a record of 4-6 overall and 1-2 in the Ivy League. After entering the season ranked No. 19 in the country, it was clear the Crimson was not exactly living up to expectations.
Even worse for Harvard, another conference loss would almost surely put an end to the squad’s hopes of securing a berth in the four-team Ivy League tournament.
“Dropping that game was the lowest of all lows,” co-captain Melanie Baskind says.
But Harvard managed to turn things around—in a big way. The Crimson won its next five games, including victories over then-No. 18 Princeton and then-No. 10 Dartmouth. After downing its next four Ivy opponents, Harvard grabbed the No. 4 seed in the Ivy tournament, where the Crimson fell in the opening round to first-seeded Penn.
The key to the Crimson’s eventual success was its defense. Harvard (9-7, 5-2 Ivy) closed out the 2012 season by holding each of its last six opponents to under 10 goals, and the Crimson’s 7.81 goals against average to finish the season was good for fifth in the nation.
“I think we had some really talented players on defense,” co-captain Ellen Gleason says. “We also had talented players coming off the bench defensively. We had the opportunity to rotate some people in, and I think that really improved our dynamic.”
Much of Harvard’s defensive success can also be attributed to the addition of rookie goalkeeper Kelly Weis. Weis, who started every game in net for the Crimson, stopped 47.4 percent of the shots she faced, the 14th-best mark in the country.
“She was so instrumental in our success,” says Baskind of Weis, who was an All-Ivy honorable mention.
Gleason also played a crucial role in the Crimson’s defensive success. A senior defender, Gleason started all 16 games and was the Crimson’s lone representative on the All-Ivy First Team.
“We were all so happy and proud of her because she’s someone that doesn’t get recognized all the time for holding it all together back there,” Baskind says. “She was really the main reason why we gave up so few goals this season. We all knew, but now everybody knows.”
While the Crimson’s defense held strong throughout the year, Harvard struggled at times on the offensive end early in the season.
After averaging 12.19 goals per game in 2011, the Crimson failed to score in double figures in five of its first seven games. Harvard had more success finding the back of the net in its nine remaining regular season contests, putting up at least 10 scores on five occasions.
Part of the Crimson’s early troubles could be attributed to a change in style. While Harvard relied on junior attacker Jennifer VanderMeulen—who led the conference in scoring in 2010 and 2011—in each of the past two seasons, the Crimson employed a much more balanced attack in 2012.
VanderMeulen finished third on the Crimson with 26 goals—well below her mark of 48 in 2011—behind junior midfielder Danielle Tetreault (28) and Baskind (27).
No Crimson player finished among the Ivy League’s top 10 scorers, but Harvard managed to come up with goals when needed.
The Crimson rebounded from its loss at Virginia with a convincing 16-8 win over Brown to improve to 2-2 in league play. One week later, Harvard hosted 3-1 Princeton at Harvard Stadium in a pivotal matchup.
Led by Tetreault’s four scores, the Crimson grabbed a 10-7 win.
“[Against] Princeton was the first time that we really pulled it together,” Baskind says. “There was just a feeling after that game, where it was like, ‘It doesn’t matter what happened up to this point. This is the team we are now moving forward [with].’ That was a really memorable game.”
Harvard closed out the regular season with a 10-3 win over Columbia and a 7-5 victory against Dartmouth to set up a rematch with No. 1 seed Penn in the opening round of the Ivy League tournament.
In its second Ancient Eight contest of the season on March 10, the Crimson dropped a 14-13 overtime decision at Penn. Harvard hoped to gain retribution in its first-round playoff matchup, but the Crimson never came close against a talented Quakers squad.
Harvard fell behind 6-1 in the opening frame and was unable to bounce back in the second, connecting on just five of its 27 shots in the matchup.
The loss brought an end to a season that the Crimson had managed to turn around.
“There were some really low points in the season; it’s what made the success we had towards the end that much more meaningful,” Baskind says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The stranger edges of science and technology are generally couched in the terms of the impossible, the unlikely, or at the very least the under-funded and thus considerably delayed. As someone who cares perhaps a little too much about those edges, it is disheartening to see the plans written up for truly outrageous futures without any real hope of having them be realized. But it is understandable; there’s only so much funding to go around, and a lot of research to do that has a lot more utility now.
All of this makes the recent announcement that an asteroid mining venture, Planetary Resources, not only plans to be operational within half a decade, but also has sufficient funding to do so, something of a shock. The concept is straight out of mid-20th-century science fiction – the huge, mineral-laden rocks that clutter up space broken open and the valuable elements within put to use – and the plausibility comes from about the same place; that is to say, purely theoretical and not a little bit unrealistic. Or so I would have said before a cadre of the ultra-wealthy, including Google executive Lawrence Page and filmmaker James F. Cameron, put their collective economic weight behind the project, turning it from an impossibility to a mere risk.
Yet as much as the project, its aspirations, and even the ideology behind it (a sort of unbridled techno-optimism, and the idea that the human species not merely can but should leave the gravity well of Earth for the final frontier) appeal, it has aspects that are less than ideal. The idea that the ‘one percent’ are going to be the driving force behind the fringe of technology and science is problematic, for numerous reasons. Planetary Resources is maybe the most benign example one could name: who would be against the exploration and exploitation of space, on principle? But the venture is never going to be anything but private; the technologies developed, developed as the ideals of a small clutch of people and in the name of private enterprise. This is not to say it won’t do tremendous good, or even that those people aren’t a good fit for the job, but it is worth considering what this means for science and technology.
Consider, for example, the case of Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal. He has been involved in funding multiple initiatives aimed at promoting his vision of the future; one such project received over a million dollars to fund seasteadings, offshore artificial islands maintaining political independence from the mainland. Seasteading is an unabashedly libertarian exercise in political experimentation that has been failing to successfully set sail for decades now; it is an area of questionable technological priorities that exists only for political reasons.
But even if seasteading were successful, the technologies developed would go purely towards forwarding the aims of the small community on those artificial islands. In a certain light, asteroid mining looks uncomfortably similar, a venture funded not because of public need but because some handful of highly influential and almost obscenely wealthy investors jumped for it. And this kind of millionaire-backed science project seems to be getting more prominent, as various governmental agencies find their budgets reduced, or focus on more prosaic, more immediately practical research.
One of the strong arguments in favor of this new model is that investors can fund less immediately practical, more long-term technological ventures that a government simply cannot at the moment. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the military thinktank responsible for a considerable number of outrageous, boundary-pushing projects, is just that: a military thinktank, with military priorities. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration simply could not justify the expense of this sort of thing; the awful burden of public accountability shuts down the more outlandish possibilities.One of the strong arguments against relying on these privately funded initiatives is their easy avoidance of that burden of accountability. If this becomes the accepted method of funding the more fringe projects, then the interesting edges of science will be a plutocracy, directed towards projects more in line with these individuals’ considerations than the public good. It’s an uncomfortable image, the few and the rich getting into orbit while the rest of the planet can only watch; one small step for investors, one giant leap for investor-kind.
However, despite these misgivings, the deranged millionaire funding scheme has an unbeatable advantage: it’s the only game in town. It may not have a positive effect on the infrastructure of science and technology, but at the moment, there’s no way to fund these initiatives without recourse to the ranks of the forward-thinking one-percenters. All we mere mortals can do is sit back and hope they make good decisions, and try to support them when they do. Asteroids won’t mine themselves, and for now, we’ll be looking to those with a few million to spare to get the job done; we should keep aware of the trend, but for now it looks like trickle-down technology is the only way to go.

The more clichés cluster around an idea, the more it should be examined; clichés are the SOS of stalled thinking or stale assumptions. Growing up, we are always told to be a “team player,” or, more pointedly, reminded that there “is no I in team.” Spelling suggestions are one thing, but the pressure to work together presumes to teach us algebra as well, as “two heads are always better than one.” I put quotes around these words, but, in fact, they are attributable to no one in particular, which is a kind of justice, as nobody wants to take undue credit, lest they be labeled selfish linguistic innovators.
But how well we work together is, in fact, much more complicated than these middle school maxims would have us believe. Math and science courses encourage collaborative work on problem sets, but discourage it (to put it mildly) during exams. Humanities courses, on the other hand, reinforce paper writing as a solitary endeavor, unless all those Gmail Chat sessions are somehow helping you make your argument about the complicated role of politics in “Middlemarch” (unlikely).  But even this dichotomy is too stark. At the graduate and professional levels of academia, collaboration is encouraged, as if scholars emerge from a long “time-out” ready to play well with others. But why should these complexities be the case? Or to put it another way, what is the role of others in our own intellectual development?
In an article published in the Jan. 30 issue of The New Yorker entitled “Groupthink: The Brainstorming Myth,” Jonah Lehrer argues, “there is one overwhelming problem with brainstorming. It doesn’t work.” Citing the work of Charlan J. Nemeth, Lehrer proposes that the most effective way to get ideas going is to engage in debate and criticism, rather than unmitigated positive affirmation. Now, it would be fair to counter that this is not exactly an argument against collaboration per se, but rather a prescription for a specific type of team work. But it is true as well that the more we challenge, refute, and prod, the more we act as discrete individuals rather than as a cohesive unit. Too often, working together means neglecting or frustrating our own vision in favor of a “consensus” that speaks for no one.
The isolation that can define the writing experience for many of us can be equally problematic. The best, most productive minds can function as their own interlocutors, texturing their work with the insights of a thousand minds and the cadences of a thousand voices. But for most of us, our head can be a cramped place to be. It can be difficult to think of new ideas or adopt novel approaches; everything we write tends to sound the same. The solution, I think, is to be wary of approaches that veer too far toward either extreme. If we have a problem set to do, try talking about it with someone not from your class, perhaps even a religion concentrator. Try to explain what you do and why to a friend from another discipline, and thereby articulate why it’s important to you. If you are a humanities concentrator, don’t be afraid to open your ideas to critique and questioning. Recommend a great book you’ve read, and discuss your ideas with people who wouldn’t be able to tell Keats from carbon.
One of the best things about our residential house system is what we share. But sometimes, it is important to hold a little back and let some idea we have been considering or equation we have been grappling with be with ourselves, and ourselves alone. By all means, share the highs and lows of life. But remember that we are sometimes more surprising than we expect ourselves to be. Let’s be sure we give each other the time and space to notice.

The Times—they are a-changin’. Today, more people choose to go online to get their news fill than pick up a paper. Nearly 75 percent of people surveyed by the Pew Internet and American Life Project got their news from email or social networking sites. The print industry has long been put on life support as news gets more and more social; now you not only read a story, but share its link with friends by email or comment on it through Facebook and Twitter feeds. In a hyperlinked world, news is no longer a one-way phenomenon, it is circular. Everyone is creating, sharing, and distributing new content online and while this is mostly convenient and expedient, it can also create false notions about the comprehensiveness of our news consumption.
While it seems as if news-aggregating sites and social media tools like Facebook will present the best of the news in the world to us, these services pose a very real concern that we can become trapped in a cycle of news that maps very closely onto the beliefs of only our social and cultural groups.
Good for you if you read several newspapers online, clicking through every section, but as Pew’s study reveals (and many of us will recall from our own online behavior) people tend to gravitate toward only a handful of links: the ones most emailed, or most discussed. Online news websites triumphantly feature countdowns of these most popular stories, which eventually morph into self-perpetuating cycles of popular opinion.
Recent studies of online users also reveal that we systematically choose to read only that which we already agree with. For users who get their online news solely from social media sites, this self-reassuring spiral is even more pronounced. On Facebook, our friends turn into human filters. Most people read what their friends read, share these links, write notes and comments on debates within a closed group of like-minded individuals. As the information overload grows, individuals begin to rely more on their social groups and trusted sources, to sift through the clutter of news. We choose a few personal “news curators”—people we follow on Twitter or whose feeds we subscribe to on Facebook— and trust them to handpick the news pieces most relevant to us.
Social media is good at creating bubbles around us—that’s part of their charm. They help us to customize every dimension of our lives through an endless series of likes. But algorithms like the Facebook news feed expose us to a precariously small range of views. A recent study released by Facebook at its f8 developer conference in 2011 confirms that users are more likely to click on news links from friends they were close to. It’s great to use Facebook to filter through our personal and commercial interests. But when this filter extends to our intellectual life, it can trap us in an online echo chamber by gradually minimizing our interaction with opposing thoughts and cutting off our engagement with the broader world.
Sure, even in real life people can choose to flip channels or read only sections of a newspaper, but at least the choice here is intentional. The concern online is that most people do not understand or pay attention to the increased filtering of our worlds by computer algorithms or our social circles. Google, for instance, stores users’ past preferences and turns up different search results for different people, even on the most recent news items. Websites like Twitter also make suggestions about whom to follow based on personalized data such as a user’s existing contacts. The Twitter trending topics you see vary based on your location. Not just social media, even newspaper websites like The New York Times or Washington Post present news search results in order of relevance to us and make it easier to settle into our e-comfort zones.
Even students at Harvard, with all its emphasis on diversity, aren’t immune to default social and intellectual collusion. One of the first items that pops up on my Facebook feed is the Washington Post Social Reader. I am told that 87 of my friends within the Harvard network have used it just last month, sharing, and reading a limited collection of all the news that’s fit to publish. I’ve been tempted by its convenience but am wary of the large number of people who like the same few stories.
In a hyper-networked world, there’s no simple solution to the slight or sometimes large biases and filters that may creep into our intellectual life. Perhaps it may help to actively seek out media sources that you disagree with. I’m personally not sure if I can handle constant updates from both Instapundit and Daily Kos in the same feed, but I’ll try scrolling through all sections of an entire newspaper for a start.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For a candidate whose foreign policy expertise was presumably sharpened by his two year mission in Europe, Mitt Romney’s pronunciations on the Russian Federation are especially surprising. In recent weeks, Romney’s views on Russia have come into focus and become more widely scrutinized, notably in recent articles in The New York Times and The Washington Post.
In one exceptional and already notorious case, the Republican candidate elect stated that Russia was the United States’s “number one geopolitical foe.” Although he would admit that states like Iran and North Korea pose a greater immediate threat to global stability, Romney appears to cling to the implicit assumption that a post-Soviet Russia still poses the gravest danger to American interests. In particular, he has cited Russian support for rogue nations at the United Nations; given Russia’s status as a permanent member of the Security Council, the Kremlin is able to shield regimes such as Bashar al-Assad’s despotic and cruel regime in Syria from international censure.
The logical fallacy behind Romney’s conception of Russia as America’s greatest enemy is apparent. Despite Romney’s determination that the anchor of the former Soviet Union remains a serious threat to American freedom, the reality suggests otherwise. Admittedly, Russia today is mistrustful and suspicious of American motives, particularly regarding the construction of a missile shield in Central and Eastern Europe. At home, Russia is far from a free country; “managed democracy,” a term too often used by Western media outlets, has served as a byword for Vladimir Putin’s “United Russia” party’s domination of the political sphere for more than a decade.
But Russia hardly qualifies as the U.S.’s most pressing adversary. Rather, both the modern Russian Federation and the United States face similar challenges: both struggle, though in different ways, with the threat of Islamic-inspired fundamentalist terrorism. While the United States may face the impending question of how to deal with rising Chinese economic power, Russia has already been forced to accept economic second-power status. Unlike the U.S., Russia faces acute immediate challenges: she must confront an imminent demographic crisis arguably worse than anything faced by the least fecund Western European countries. While Russian GDP growth had been phenomenal under the first few years of Putin’s administration, the long-term outlook for an extractive-resource and, specifically, petro-state economy seems uncertain.
Both Russia and the United States face similar challenges, albeit to different extremes, of how to reduce large nuclear arsenals, push back terrorism, and address long-term competitiveness issues. In the post-Soviet era, the two countries have been on remarkably good terms considering their Cold War relations. With that in mind, the Republicans’ apparent desire to return to imminent nuclear-war rivalry is quite baffling.
Mr. Romney would do well to avoid characterizing Russia as evil. His own understanding of Russian relations can in part be informed or explained by the suggestion that he views foreign policy as a “zero sum" game. Such an outlook bears a depressing resemblance to former president George W. Bush’s pronouncement to the effect of “you are either with us or against us.” Good or evil, blessed or satanic; these are the kinds of counterproductive, black and white judgments that Barack Obama, however successful or not he has been at foreign policy, has at least avoided in his administration. It would be a shame to revert to this good-evil divide.
Instead, Romney and the American public would do well to recognize who is working to deliver reform and democracy in Russia and who is hindering this effort. Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index regularly lists the world’s largest country as among the most corrupt. In many cases, large-scale corruption has also turned Russia into a violent and lawless state. Witness the now well-known death of Moscow lawyer Sergei L. Magnitsky and the U.S. Congress’ subsequent effort to pass the “Magnistsky Act” aimed at targeting corrupt bureaucrats and security officials thought to be behind Magnitsky’s death after he exposed a massive fraud. Romney and the Republican Party would do well to draw the distinction between an ill-informed view of a “Russia” driven by ulterior motives and the reality: the desire of Russians to secure a more ethical and democratic future for their country.
Russia is not the U.S.’s best friend, but neither should the two states be anything approaching real enemies. Romney’s conception of Russia is indeed confusing to today’s generation of young Americans who have grown up in a post-Cold War era, and who in many cases know—or are among—the millions of former U.S.S.R. immigrants who have moved to the United States.
Russia has changed and modernized considerably since the fall of the Soviet Union. Any visitor to today’s Moscow would surely balk at the idea that the capital represents Washington D.C.’s top adversary. Romney’s own misguided stance re-emphasizes the need to interact with contemporary powers through diplomacy and understanding rather than jingoistic and uninformed nationalism.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There are only two Ancient Eight schools with men’s volleyball teams—Princeton and Harvard—so to say the Crimson is the best Ivy team does not mean much.
But Harvard ended its season ranked No. 15 in the country, with senior and freshman representatives on the All-EIVA First Team, and the Bob Sweeney EIVA Coach of the Year—meaning the 2012 campaign was arguably the best in program history.
Going 18-6 overall and 10-4 in conference play, the Crimson racked up the program’s most wins in two decades and the third-most in history.
These numbers become especially impressive coming off the squad’s 2011 season in which the team had a .409 winning percentage and a dismal 1-7 conference record.
This year’s efforts were led by senior Matt Jones, a co-captain and member of the All-EIVA First Team. Jones had a team-high 3.83 kills per set—good for ninth in the nation—as well as a team-high .42 service aces per set, also ninth in the nation.
But what made Jones and the rest of the seniors truly indispensable were their roles as leaders on the team.
“I knew right away the players wanted to build a program and a team they could be proud of,” says Crimson coach Brian Baise of the senior class, which has been with him since his start at Harvard. “They’ve done that, and that makes my job a lot easier and a lot more fun. I put a lot of pride in how we compete, and the guys never let me down.”
“I think we had a bit more maturity as a team [this year],” adds junior setter Rob Lothman, who had 889 assists in the Crimson’s 24 total matches. “In past years, we had a limited amount of senior influence…. We had a lot of raw talent, but I think we lacked that refinement that comes from playing together for more than a year.”
But that said, with Harvard’s marked improvement over last year’s season, some credit is due to the team’s rookie class as well, specifically DJ White, another member of the All-EIVA First Team, and Caleb Zimmick. Before being sidelined by injury, Zimmick contributed hits and blocks at middle, while White joined Jones as an ace at outside hitter.
Harvard came together this season to pull out 3-0 and 3-2 wins against the rival Tigers and a road victory against No. 12 Cal State Northridge.
“Most of the top teams are on the West Coast, and we had a 3-1 record against West Coast teams this year,” Lothman says. “So we got a little more exposure and a little more game experience against top teams which always helps.”
In 2011, the Matadors handed the Crimson a loss in straight sets (25-16, 25-20, 25-17), but behind strong offensive performances by Jones, White, and sophomore opposite hitter Nick Madden, Harvard got retribution this year with a four-set victory (25-17, 25-20, 22-25, 25-22).
The mid-season triumph capped off a six-game winning streak and propelled the Crimson to second-place in the conference. A five-set marathon against No. 7 Penn State—despite ending in a Harvard loss—gained the Crimson even more attention at the national level and set the stage for the future of Harvard volleyball.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While most of the school will remember 2012 as the year Harvard basketball first entered the national spotlight by entering the country’s top polls, the 2012 Harvard men’s volleyball team (18-6, 10-4 EIVA) can also look back on this year as the first time it gained national recognition after one of the most impressive seasons in program history.
Though it was knocked out of the EIVA tournament in the first round, the Crimson was able to attract attention from the country’s coaches after an impressive spring break road trip put them against some of the country’s elite. With its first ranking under its belt, the Harvard will continue to reap the benefits that national recognition brings.
“[The ranking] was symbolic of us going out there and maturing as a program and as a team,” Crimson coach Brian Baise says. “It’s given us some national attention, which will help with all parts of the program.”
Harvard was coming off of a 9-13 season, during which the Crimson’s young team was only able to pick up one conference victory. But that youth quickly turned into experience, as the team got off to a hot start to the season.
“Last year we had a good team, but a young team,” Baise says. “We lost a lot of close games, and we played a lot of really good volleyball. I could tell pretty early on that we were going to be good—that the work ethic and desire were there.”
That desire was shown in the squad’s opening matches, as Harvard began the season with four straight wins against non-conference opponents. To extend its winning streak, the Crimson would have to host a tough opponent from the West Coast in Cal Baptist.
Harvard did more than hold its own, though, taking down the Lancers in four games and giving the team the program’s best start since the 1993 season.
But the beginning of conference play showed the Crimson that it was not untouchable, as George Mason handed it a 3-0 loss at home to begin the EIVA slate. Harvard did not dwell on the defeat for long, though, taking down Princeton in three games the next day.
And after then-No. 5 Penn State grabbed a win at the Malkin Athletic Center, the Crimson began an eight-game conference winning streak to shoot towards the top of the standings.
Harvard was buoyed by co-captain and outside hitter Matt Jones. Jones finished the season ranked second in the EIVA in kills per set and fourth in aces per set. Jones made contributions on both sides of the ball, as he earned EIVA Offensive and Defensive Player of the week awards at different times in the season.
For spring break, the team traveled to California, a historically strong volleyball state, for a challenging road trip. Its first matchup, against No. 12 Cal State Northridge, looked to be the most challenging.
But rather than fold, the then-unranked Crimson took it to the Matadors, downing them, 3-1, on their own court.
“I think it was our biggest game of the year,” sophomore outside hitter Nick Madden says. “Beating them pretty badly made us believe for the rest of the season that we were capable of beating teams.”
Jones agreed with his teammate, underlining the importance of that victory, but also the importance of the entire trip.
“For so many reasons, the Cal State Northridge win signifies what our team is about this and where our program is,” Jones says. “The trip as a whole legitimized that we were a good team and a team that could compete in the playoffs. After that trip, we felt just making the playoffs wasn’t enough, and that we could do more.”
The squad continued its strong form for the rest of the regular season, taking the first two games against the Nittany Lions away from home before the 2008 national champions snatched the match back and won in five. Harvard took the two seed going into the playoffs, but knew it would have to fight through a tough George Mason squad and most likely Penn State again to reach the NCAA tournament.
But in the first round of the EIVA tournament, the Crimson took on a bigger team in the Patriots. After splitting the season series, George Mason came out on top, ending the Crimson’s run.
Though Jones will likely leave a big hole in Harvard’s roster, a big incoming class and a wealth of young talent, including freshman All-EIVA first-teamer DJ White, will have the Crimson in prime position to compete at the top again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fueled by a strong core of underclassmen swimmers, the Crimson swimming and diving team placed second in the Ivy League for the fourth year in a row while eight members of the team earned All-American honors and five swimmers and three divers qualified for the NCAA Championships.
The five swimmers—all of whom were freshmen or sophomores—were the Crimson’s first NCAA competitors since All-American and United States Olympian Alex Meyer ’10 represented Harvard in 2010.
“There were a few days of nervous waiting, but we were beyond ecstatic when we found out [we qualified for NCAAs],” freshman Griffin Schumacher says. “It was an incredible experience to swim with the fastest in the country, and we got a taste of what we’re going to be experiencing the next few years.”
Harvard saw a great deal of success from its underclassmen swimmers in the 2012 season with all of its All-American honors awarded to freshmen or sophomores on the team.
Over the NCAA Championship weekend, Harvard’s relay squads gave the Crimson its best finishes. In the 800-yard freestyle relay, the team of freshmen Chuck Katis, Schumacher, and Zach Walters and sophomore Chris Satterthwaite swam to a 13th-place finish, touching the wall at 6:27.94.
“We actually weren’t sure if we were going to swim or not, because we had a different team than the one that raced at Ivies,” Schumacher says. “But Coach Murphy decided to throw us in there and see what we could do…. We were really excited to race well and get that All-America status.”
Its 400 free relay team—formed by Katis, Schumacher, Satterthwaite, and sophomore Oliver Lee—also broke into the top 20, placing 16th with a season’s best time of 2:55.18.
The relay finishes were two of the Crimson’s seven total top-25 finishes at the national level this year.
Within the Ancient Eight though, the men’s swimming and diving finishes have been stagnant over the last several years, with Princeton claiming the title and Harvard trailing in second for four consecutive years, while Yale took third for the third straight year. But the Crimson program continued to build in strength, breaking several school, pool, and meet records this season.
In the Ivy Championship meet alone, Harvard shattered six school records and logged a season-best 22 NCAA ‘B’ standard times. Satterthwaite shined in the meet, earning three individual Ivy League titles in the 50 free, 100 free and 200 free; setting school records in the 50 free (19.84 seconds) and the 100 free (43.18 seconds); and meriting a share of the Phil Moriarity Award—an honor given to the meet’s top point earner.
“It was really, really impressive,” sophomore Spenser Goodman says of Satterthwaite’s performance. “I think he won the three events that are the hardest to win.... Those races come down to tenths or hundredths of a second. He’s just an amazing swimmer, and everyone’s really excited for him and excited to see what he can do in the next two years.”
Harvard divers also saw success in the Ivies. Freshman Mike Mosca continued the Crimson’s tradition of dominance in the one-meter dive, earning the title with a mark of 359.55 points. Mosca’s first-place Ivy finish in the one-meter represented Harvard’s seventh title in the event in the last 11 years.
Despite Harvard’s individual successes, the No. 24 Tigers continued to exact their authority in the Ivy League. As Harvard’s only conference loss on the season, Princeton represented the Crimson’s biggest rival, and the teams entered the championships prepared to duke it out. Harvard held a promising 27-point lead after the first day of races and dives, but day two of the competition ended with Princeton besting the Crimson with a meet-best 1,523.5 points.
“Overall everyone swam really well [at Ivy Championships],” Schumacher says. “It was tough losing to Princeton. Everything went pretty much how we wanted it to, so it was an especially tough loss. But we’re excited to come back next year with more training and some good recruits.”
The Crimson started the season off at a torrid pace, adding four tallies to the win column in as many meets against its conference competitors. In each meet, Harvard won by more than 60 points.
The team ventured outside the Ivies this season facing national powerhouse Ohio State—then the No. 8 team in the country—in January and competing in the North Carolina Invitational in November in Chapel Hill, N.C.
Though the Buckeyes gave the Crimson its first loss of the season and cracked its 13-meet win streak, the Harvard swimmers demonstrated their potential for success at the national level in the matchup.
Katis swept his events, taking first in the 100 and 200 breast and the 200 IM.
“He’s just unreal,” Goodman says. “That kid could swim at any school.”
Satterthwaite and Walters went 1-2 in the 200 free, while Harvard swept the 400 free relay with 1-2-3 finishes.
The Crimson faced fierce competition again in the North Carolina Invitational. Against some of the most elite swimming and diving squads east of the Mississippi—including then No. 12 North Carolina and No. 19 North Carolina State—Harvard placed fifth behind North Carolina (1,334), Navy (752), Duke (572.5) and South Carolina (508.5).
With its young talent, the Crimson finds itself poised for unprecedented success in the future.
“This [season] is a stepping stone for years to come,” said Schumacher in March after the NCAA Championships. “In a few years, we can be a top-15 team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Managing a successful Division I sports team is difficult enough when a coach is surrounded by an entire support staff. It’s even more difficult when a coach is on his own.
But Brian Baise, the man at the helm of Harvard’s men’s volleyball program and the Bob Sweeney EIVA Coach of the Year, has done more than just rise to that challenge. Baise has turned the program around and, in just his fourth year as coach, led his team to its most successful season in more than a decade.
Building profound respect amongst his players in those four years, Baise has come to be known for his reserved leadership from the sideline.
“He’s not the loudest coach I’ve ever had,” co-captain Matt Jones says. “He has a very precise and subtle style, but when you contrast that with an occasional outburst, it’s really effective communication for the team.”
“He doesn’t say a lot during games, but when he does, it makes an impact,” sophomore outside hitter Nick Madden adds.
And despite what Madden calls a “one-man coaching staff,” Baise has been able to help the Crimson gain a better understanding of its opponents, an important factor in the team’s relatively small EIVA conference.
“One thing he does super well is communicating to us about the teams we’re going to play,” Madden says. “He scouts them inside and out. He’s very meticulous with film. He’s a great game coach.”
But what really sets Baise apart at Harvard is the faith he has in his players to get the job done.
“He’s done a great job of toeing that line of when to trust us and build ourselves up and when he needs to step in and says we need to get better,” Jones says. “He balances team development as well as individual development—I give a lot of credit to him for where I am as a volleyball player.”
As this year’s Crimson seniors graduate, Baise will say goodbye to the class of players that have been with him since his start at Harvard, but Jones and his classmates are confident Baise’s influence on the program’s success will not slow down.
“I think [Baise] is getting better every year, which shows his dedication and desire to make this program better,” Jones says. “He’s not content, he’s not ambivalent, and he wants to see the program improve.”

“Keep calm and fight on.”
The Harvard women’s swimming and diving team lived by this motto the entire season, and it paid off. For the first time in seven years, the Crimson earned both the dual meet title and the Ivy League Championship title.
“I think that everything sort of came through for us at the end,” captain-elect Brittany Powell says.  “Everyone put in a lot of hard work throughout the whole year, and it obviously culminated with our championship win.”
The women knew success was possible when they took down Princeton, their biggest competition for the titles, at the Harvard-Yale-Princeton meet.  The Crimson and the Tigers were both undefeated coming into the final dual meet of the season.
Harvard showed Princeton that it was a force to be reckoned with from the first event, the 200-yard medley relay.  Juniors Caroline Weaver and Mackenzie Luick and freshmen Ana Anaya and Sarah Sumner finished first, breaking a school record and beating the Tigers with a time of 1:42.39.
“We were just super pumped up that [the relay] went so well,” captain-elect Sara Li says.  “I think the energy on the pool deck was just contagious and...it just fired everyone up.  We never looked back from the first event on.”
From there the Crimson dominated the meet, placing first in 10 of the 16 events.  In the end, Harvard beat the Tigers, 190-110, and Yale, 235-65, to steal the title.
“There have been years in the past where we have won the Ivy Championships, but haven’t been able to clinch the dual meet title,” senior Meghan Leddy said.  “By winning [HYP] this year, we went undefeated for the first time in a while and it was a really exciting meet from the very beginning. I think everyone was really pumped for it.”
In addition to its undefeated dual title win were victories over Dartmouth, 187.5-110.5, Cornell, 218-80, Columbia, 157-143, Penn, 249-49, and Brown, 193-107.
The Crimson also competed at the Georgia Invitational, the MIT Invitational, and the Texas Invitational with overall finishes of sixth, seventh, and 12th, respectively.
“We set really high goals for ourselves in the beginning of the year, stuck to them, made sure we held each other accountable as teammates, and kind of kept the goal in mind while working hard the whole season,” Li says.
During J-Term, Harvard sent its swimmers to Puerto Rico and its divers to Hawaii for training.  The meets were not scored, but they prepared the women for the rest of the season.
The Crimson hosted its second important meet of the season—the Ivy League Championships—and came ready to defend its home turf.  After a rough start at the prelims on the first morning, Harvard rallied to finish first with 1,478.5 points, taking down Princeton, the defending Ivy League champions for two straight years, by 168 points.
“It really took a lot to focus on what we were doing and not get ahead of ourselves for the whole meet,” Leddy says. “But I think we swam really strong.”
Senior diver Leslie Rea made Ivy League history that day by becoming the league’s all-time leading point scorer upon the completion of her one-meter and three-meter dives, in which she earned third and second place finishes respectively.
“The last day we had three divers in the finals at night and they dominated; it was huge,” Powell says.  “[Rea] placed second and the second we won the race that tipped the boat meaning we were automatically going to win was the best moment.”
Two weeks after the team’s season ended, Rea and sophomores Alex Stanton and Schuyler Moore traveled to Buffalo, N.Y. for the NCAA Zone A Diving Championships to qualify for the NCAA Division I Championships.  The Crimson failed to advance to the national meet, which required a first place finish at the Zone A meet.  Rea ranked highest of the Harvard divers, finishing 11th in the one-meter dive after competing in the finals and 21st in the three-meter dive.
Meanwhile, Leddy and freshman Courtney Otto were invited to compete in the NCAA championship swim meet in Auburn, Ala.  Despite posting solid times in their events, the women failed to make it back for the final rounds.  Otto finished 54th in the 500 freestyle, 30th in the 400 IM, and 24th in the 200 butterfly, a mere .62 seconds out of the finals.  Leddy placed 42nd in the 200 backstroke and 59th in the 100 backstroke, clocking in at 55.72, only .56 seconds off of the school record.
Harvard looks to train hard for next season in hopes of earning a second consecutive Ivy League title.
“I think the two classes that really stepped up this year were the freshman and sophomore classes, so they’ll be getting into more leadership roles this year,” Leddy says.  “I think they’ll be able to take the team and keep it going and hopefully do back-to-back championships.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While most of Harvard’s athletes have packed their bags and headed home for the summer, the sailing team is just beginning the most exciting portion of its season.
In the coming weeks, both the women’s and co-ed teams will compete in the Sailing Association National Championship in Austin, Texas. The women’s competition will begin on May 30, while the co-ed competition will start shortly afterwards on June 6.
The women’s team was the first to qualify for the national regatta.  It did so on April 21 by taking seventh place in the New England Women’s Championship. Harvard scored 271 total points in the competition. Boston College, the regatta hosts, scored 97 points, exactly sixty less than second-place Yale.
Co-captain Emily Lambert and classmate Alexandra Jumper competed in the A Division for Harvard.  The pair finished with 117 points, good enough for fifth place.  Later, sophomores Morgan Russom, Caitlin Watson, and Isabel Ruane placed fifth in the B division with a score of 154 points.
Unlike the women’s team, the co-ed racers have to compete in a semi-final competition to qualify for nationals. The co-ed team earned its ticket to Austin on May 14, when the Crimson placed third in the Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association Semi-Finals.
Although the team sat in eighth place after the first day of competition, Harvard bounced back to score 84 points in the A Division and 102 points in the B division.  The team’s total of 186 put it in a tie with SUNY Maritime  College, but the Crimson won the head-to-head tiebreaker. The University  of Miami won the competition.
Unless either team wins a national championship, the Crimson will consider the New England Dinghy Championship to be the highlight of the season.  On April 14-15, Harvard hoisted the New England championship trophy for the first time since 2001.
The Crimson hosted the regatta on the Charles River.  Although a casual fan might not associate “home field advantage” with sailing, being familiar with the Charles certainly gave Harvard a leg up on its competition since the river is famous for its confusing currents and strange winds.
Over the course of the weekend, the Crimson used its experience on the Charles to garner a total of 231 points. Harvard scored 110 points in the A division, tops in the category. The B division team performed well, too, tallying 121 points. It was a tight finish over Roger Williams, whose score of 240 was good enough for second place.
Senior William White, who is also a Crimson news editor, says the team was a little surprised by the school’s first New England championship in 11 years.
“I don’t think we went in expecting to win [the New England championship], but we had some really good seniors, and we got it done,” he says.
In some ways, this has been the theme of the season. After losing a deep graduating class that included five members of the All-New England Intercollegiate Sailing Association team, many expected this to be a down year for the Crimson.
But co-captains Lambert and Brandon Kopp have led their team to eighteen top-10 finishes on the year, including another win in the Hood Trophy regatta on Sept. 24-25 at Tufts University.
Kopp earned end-of-the-season accolades of his own when he was named to the to the first-team All-NEISA skipper group. Sophomore Sarah Pierson, Kopp’s racing partner, was awarded with a place on the first-team crew group. The pair led Harvard to the New England championship with two first- and second-place finishes in the regatta.
Slattery says that the team’s success, which comes to no surprise to him and his teammates, has the squad looking forward to competing in the national championship.
“We feel very confident as a team. We’ve done nothing but improve, and we got third at semis…. We are not going into finals expecting to do especially well, but we know we have the skills to do so,” he says.
Regardless of how it does in the upcoming national regattas, the team’s showing only can add to what has turned out to be a successful year for the Crimson sailing program.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Excelling in one sport your freshman year is hard enough. In two? That’s almost unheard of.
But rookie Zach Boden pulled it off.
Boden first rapidly ascended the football depth charts to become one of two pivotal running backs on the Ivy-champion Harvard football team. Then, in the spring, the rookie walked on to the baseball team, where he had the team’s second highest batting average at one point before injury cut his season short.
Though recruited for football, Boden wasn’t ready to give up baseball just yet. And in the future, though he sees himself as a football player first, he plans to continue both.
“Football is more like a job, baseball is more [for] fun, I guess,” Boden says. “Although I love playing football more than anything else in the world.”
When the Georgia native first broached the idea of joining the baseball team, Crimson coach Tim Murphy was skeptical, worrying that Boden would struggle balancing the time demands of both sports.
“[Boden] said, ‘Coach, I’ve mapped it out, I can do it,’” Murphy recalls. “I said, ‘If you can do it, that’s great. But I just don’t see how you can.’ And he found a way to do it.”
But months before that decision, the rookie had already made his name on the gridiron at running back.
After starting the year on the scout team, Boden cemented his status on the first squad with a standout performance in a preseason scrimmage against Dartmouth when the team’s number one running back, junior Treavor Scales, was benched to avoid risking injury.
“[In the game, Boden] busts a couple big, impressive runs and from then on in, we say, ‘Hey, we can rationalize all we want, but this kid is our second best running back,’” Murphy says. “And the rest is history.”
Ten games later, Boden had run for six touchdowns and 484 yards on just 79 carries, good for a team-best 6.1 yards per carry. The rookie’s performance of the season came in a 112-yard outburst against Dartmouth in a snowstorm, when he, Scales, and senior quarterback Collier Winters became the first trio in Harvard history to each run for 100 or more yards in a single game.
“The Dartmouth game on the whole was just crazy fun. That was awesome,” Boden says. “It was a whole other world compared to playing down in Georgia.”
Boden followed up his strong season on the gridiron with another solid showing on the baseball diamond.
Boden finished with a .314 batting average and six stolen bases, sixth best and second best on the team respectively. All that while not seeing any Ivy League action, when offensive production numbers were generally higher, because of an injury sustained a week before football’s spring game.
“[Harvard baseball coach Joe Walsh] didn’t really have to give me playing time or anything, but he gave me the opportunity,” Boden says. “And I just kind of ran with it. It was sweet.”
Despite making an immediate impact on both teams in his first year, this appears to be just the beginning for the rising sophomore.
“We don’t exactly know what we have yet,” Murphy says of Boden. “But the potential is really exciting.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After dropping its semifinal matchup of the 2012 Potter Cup to 13-time defending national champion Trinity, the Harvard men’s squash team bounced back, taking down Cornell, 5-4, in the consolation final to claim the No. 3 spot in the nation.
And although the Crimson (16-4, 5-2 Ivy) fell in two of its first three individual matches against the Big Red, Harvard freshman Nick Hopcroft was able to muster a crucial fifth win at the No. 4 spot to lock in a victory for his team.
“As I was watching the match unfold, it became clear that mine would be the match,” Hopcroft says. “Somehow, I managed to win it. I’ve always wanted to play in a situation like that and win one for the team.”
“It was an incredible feeling,”  Hopcroft continues. “It was a dogfight [against Cornell], but we came out on top.”
The win marked the Crimson’s first top-three finish at the CSA National Team Championships since 2007 and served as a fitting capstone for a solid season that began with an 11-game winning streak and featured exactly as many 9-0 wins.
“Our third-place finish was the best Harvard has done in many years, so we’re very pleased with the improvement that we’re showing,” Hopcroft says. “That said, we have bigger ambitions for next season. We’re determined to try to win the national title next year.”
Meanwhile, a team other than Trinity was crowned national champion for the first time since Harvard last won the title in 1998: Princeton. The Tigers took down the Bantams, 5-4, in the Potter Cup finals in Princeton, N.J., breaking the longest title streak in the history of intercollegiate sports.
Princeton had bested the Crimson by the same score on Jan. 15.
“At the beginning of the season, different people would show up to play on different days, but we never really got it going on the same day,” Hopcroft says. “Throughout the season, we struggled with that. We lost tight matches to Princeton and to Trinity, matches we could have won. But everyone came together at nationals…and we’re proud of the way we played.”
And despite halting Trinity’s 252-game winning streak on Jan. 18, Yale ended the year in the No. 5 slot nationally.
“I think that shows you just how close the teams were this year,” sophomore Gary Power says. “One of our goals coming into the season was to end that streak, but our bigger aim was to win the national championship.”
“[The season] was a good learning experience,” Power adds. “We’re an incredibly young team. We didn’t reach our full potential, but I’m confident we’ll be in a good position next year.”
Harvard—seeded fourth in the eight-team national championship field—kicked off the tournament with a 6-3 win against a Rochester team seeking retribution after being upset by the Crimson during the regular season. But Harvard came to play against the Yellowjackets, securing a trip to the semifinals after just six individual matches had been played.
Trinity clinched the semifinal matchup between the two teams in a similar fashion, taking all three second-cycle matches and tallying a win—and a trip to the finals—after the first six.
The loss was the Crimson’s second to the Bantams in 2012, as Trinity bounced back from its only regular season loss to dismantle the Harvard, 7-2, on Jan. 21.
“We’ve had some ups and downs this season,” Power says. “At nationals, we played the best we could and lost a tough one to Trinity, a team I think was the best in the nation this year.... Going forward with such a young team, the future looks good.”
Sophomore Ali Farag led the young Crimson team from the No. 1 spot, finishing his rookie season at Harvard undefeated and with a CSA Individual National Championship under his belt.
“[Farag] puts in more hours than anyone I’ve seen,” Hopcroft says. “As you can see from the results, his hard work has paid off.”
Farag and classmate Brandon McLaughlin received All-American honors, earning spots on the first and second teams, respectively.
Harvard’s lineup at the end of the season featured seven underclassmen in its top nine, including Hopcroft and fellow freshman Tyler Olson. The Crimson also boasts one of the strongest sophomore classes in the nation, with Farag, McLaughlin, Power, Nigel Koh, and Tommy Mullaney all playing in the top nine.
“We’re a very young team,” Hopcroft says. “We only lose one senior, [co-captain Will Ahmed], and the experience we’ve gained this year can only be helpful.... Next year, we’ll come back stronger.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a year of change for the Harvard field hockey team in 2011. Following three seasons of substandard results, including a 3-14 campaign in 2010, the Crimson boasted a winning record in the final week of the season before a three-game skid ultimately dropped it to 8-9 on the year.
Still, it was Harvard’s best finish since 2007, and for much of the season the Crimson (8-9, 3-4 Ivy) made a serious bid for the conference title in a wide-open Ivy League championship race.
But perhaps the season’s biggest drama played out in the offseason, when the athletic department chose not to renew the contract of head coach Sue Caples, who had been with the program for 24 years.
“We weren’t given any details on the decision,” rising co-captain Kim Goh told The Crimson in December. “They just said that they talked to many people, and it was looked at from many different directions.”
Outgoing captain Georgia McGillivray declined to comment on Caples’ release, describing the situation as “internal stuff.”
The program has since moved forward, hiring former University of Maryland associate head coach Tjerk van Herwaarden, who spent seven years with the Terrapins before accepting his new position in Cambridge.
“The team had a lot of input in the interviewing process,” McGillivray says. “We really enjoyed getting to hear about [van Herwaarden’s] experience and his outlook, so we’re really excited.”
The timing of Caples’ departure from the program appeared all the more puzzling given the improved results Harvard displayed in 2011. The Crimson began the season with two wins over Holy Cross and Lafayette before dropping its next three contests, including the Ivy opener against Yale, a 5-1 defeat in New Haven.
But Harvard responded with a four-game winning streak, its longest since 2008. During the stretch, the Crimson moved to 2-1 in the Ivy League, besting Penn and Brown by a combined score of 8-1. The final game in the streak, a 2-1 overtime victory over Vermont, extended Harvard’s home record to a perfect 5-0.
Following a non-conference loss to Northeastern, the Crimson bounced back with a victory on the road against Cornell, improving its Ivy record to 3-1 and moving it into a first-place tie atop the Ancient Eight standings.
“It was really exciting to be among the top teams, like Princeton, Cornell, and Yale,” McGillivray says. “It showed us that the team had the potential to compete for the Ivy title.”
But the win over Cornell proved to be the high point of the season. Harvard dropped four of its last five games, narrowly missing out on its first winning record since 2004.
Following the Crimson’s trip to Ithaca, eventual conference co-champion Princeton brought Harvard back to earth in its brief challenge to Ivy League ascendancy with a dominating 4-0 win, in which the Tigers outshot the Crimson 23-10.
The Crimson rebounded with an overtime win over Colgate, in which freshman Noel Painter, the squad’s top scorer in 2011, had two goals, but a loss to Dartmouth eliminated Harvard from contention for the Ancient Eight title. Next up for the Crimson was a matchup against a powerful New Hampshire team on Senior Day with little else but pride to play for.
But Harvard put together perhaps its best overall effort of the season, giving the then-No. 10 Wildcats everything they could handle. On three separate occasions, the Crimson fell behind by a goal, but all three times Harvard equalized, the final time coming with under five minutes remaining in regulation off a score from freshman Catriona McDonald. Junior goalie Cynthia Tassopoulos, who led the conference in save percentage, did her best to stymie New   Hampshire with 14 saves.
Though the Crimson ultimately fell in overtime, Harvard competed as valiantly as it had all season in extending the America East champions to their limit.
“It was a demonstration of how resilient our team is and how hard we’ve worked,” says outgoing captain Carly Dickson, a first-team All-Ivy selection. “New Hampshire was one of the top teams in the country, and we competed, held our own, and even outplayed them for part of the game.”
With the loss, the Crimson’s record fell to an even 8-8, and a season-ending defeat at Columbia dropped Harvard to its final tally. But as an outgoing senior, Dickson was pleased with the team’s development, particularly from the low point of 2010.
“Being competitive with those top teams made practices much better,” Dickson says. “The quality across the board was really strong, and everyone was competing 100 percent.”
The departure of Caples and the entrance of van Herwaarden brings Harvard field hockey into a new coaching era for the first time in a quarter century. Though the parting with Caples was bittersweet, Dickson feels confident the program was headed in the right direction, with more success to come in 2012.
“[The seniors] are happy leaving the team in a good spot,” Dickson says. “There’s a lot of momentum going into next year, and it’s exciting for us to look forward to what’s going to come with them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At around 4 p.m. on Sept. 17, 2011, things were not looking very good for the Harvard football team.
The Crimson had just started its season with a 30-22 defeat at Holy Cross and lost its starting quarterback, fifth-year senior Collier Winters, to a hamstring injury in the process.
“There’s a lot of emotion tied into the first game, so it was very tough [to lose],” Harvard coach Tim Murphy says. “We were sloppy, we made mistakes, we beat ourselves.”
With Ivy League play about to begin, it looked like the Crimson could be on the verge of a disappointing year. But flash forward eight weeks, and Harvard had instead completed one of the most dominant seasons in its history, finishing 9-1 and a perfect 7-0 in conference games while scoring more points than any Crimson squad in the modern era.
Things started to come together the week after the Holy Cross game in the team’s home opener under the lights at a rain-soaked Harvard Stadium. Junior backup quarterback Colton Chapple threw two touchdowns, classmate Treavor Scales rushed for 129 yards, and the defense forced five turnovers in Harvard’s 24-7 win over Brown.
In the Crimson’s next contest against Lafayette, the defense was dominant again, limiting the Leopards to 1.4 yards per carry, registering five sacks, and forcing two fumbles to lead Harvard to a 31-3 win.
It was the offense’s turn to shine the following week, as Harvard escaped a shootout at Cornell with a 41-31 victory. In the win, Chapple threw for 414 yards—the second highest single-game total in Harvard history—and four touchdowns to outduel Big Red quarterback Jeff Mathews, the eventual Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year, while seniors Alex Sarkisian and Chris Lorditch became the first pair of Crimson receivers to eclipse 100 receiving yards in a single game since 2008.
“That was really an eye-opener,” Murphy says. “To put up not just solid offensive numbers but really impressive offensive numbers was just a huge emotional lift. At that point we felt like...we had the potential to win a championship.”
Back home the following week, the Crimson put together its most complete performance of the season, dominating Bucknell, 42-3. Harvard held the Bisons to -5 rushing yards—compared to 224 for the Crimson—while intercepting four Bison passes, including three inside its own five-yard line. Offensively, Chapple threw for five touchdowns before being pulled in the third quarter, becoming the first Harvard quarterback to throw for four or more scores in consecutive games and the second to throw five in a single contest.
“Colton did such a great job,” Winters says. “I think he was really prepared and ready for his opportunity, and he stepped in for me and kept things rolling.”
Winters returned the following week against Princeton, matching Chapple by throwing for 403 yards and five touchdowns of his own in the Crimson’s 56-39 win. Harvard held a commanding 42-16 lead before 23 unanswered Tigers points pulled Princeton within three early in the fourth. But Scales responded with a touchdown run, captain Alex Gedeon picked off a Princeton pass, and Winters hit sophomore tight end Cam Brate in the end zone to seal the win.
Heavy snows at Harvard Stadium could not slow the Crimson offense the following Saturday as Harvard steamrolled Dartmouth, 41-10. The Crimson took advantage of the weather and rushed for 395 yards, with Scales, Winters, and freshman Zach Boden each topping 110 yards and scoring two touchdowns. In so doing, they became the first Crimson trio to eclipse the century mark on the ground in a single game.
One week later, Harvard went into halftime tied with league bottom-dweller Columbia, but outscored the Lions 21-7 in the second half to win 35-21 and help Murphy pass Joe Restic for first place on the all-time Harvard coaching wins list with 118. In the victory—which gave the Crimson an Ivy record 11 straight seasons with at least seven wins—Harvard went back to the air, with Lorditch and junior tight end Kyle Jusczcyk each surpassing the receiving century mark and Winters throwing for 323 yards and three touchdowns.
The Crimson clinched its 14th Ivy title, and sixth under Murphy, in the season’s penultimate week by topping Penn, 37-20. After falling behind 7-0, Harvard responded with 37 unanswered points, while the defense—led by senior Josue Ortiz’s 10 tackles, two sacks, forced fumble, and fumble recovery—limited the two-time defending-champion Quakers to just 24 yards on the ground and forced three turnovers before the celebration began.
“We work so hard throughout the winter, summer workouts, the preseason, and finally the season, and we’re all working for one goal,” Chapple says. “At the end of the year when we hung up that cup, everything came into perspective, and we all realized that the hard work we put in was worth it.”
Though on paper it had nothing to play for in its season finale—the 128th rendition of The Game—Harvard was as dominant as it had been all season long. In their final collegiate contests, Winters threw for 355 yards and two scores, Gedeon returned an interception—one of three for the day on the Crimson—for a touchdown, and Ortiz earned his 10th sack, helping Harvard surge to a 45-7 win, its fifth straight and 10th victory in 11 games against archrival Yale.
“It was probably the most dominant finish to a season that we’ve had,” Murphy says. “I’m really just proud of how our team finished.”
At the end of the year, the Crimson had recorded a school record 374 points, while Ortiz won Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year and 16 others made All-Ivy teams.
“You really appreciate and respect when a team rises to the challenge like that,” Murphy says. “To finish the season so dramatically playing its best football, it leaves an indelible imprint on that senior class and on that team. That’s how you script it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It has been an exciting finish to the 2012 season so far for the Radcliffe crews. The Black and White lightweights grabbed their first gold at Eastern Sprints since 2007 while the heavyweights took first in a pair of events at the Ivy League Championships. But the season goes on for both squads.
Both the heavyweight and lightweight squads still have one more competition remaining on their schedules. The lightweights will compete at the IRA National Championships starting on June 1 while the heavyweights will race at the NCAA championships starting May 25.
“Right now we’re back at it training hard, trying to maintain our fitness level and working on some technical issues,” Gregorie says. “Every day we’re learning something new, trying to work together more cohesively, building that power and that speed.”
HEAVYWEIGHTS
The Radcliffe heavyweight crew’s season culminated in victories for both the first varsity eight and varsity four A at the first-ever Ivy League Championships on May 13 in Camden, N.J.
Previously, the title had been given to the Ivy 1V that finished best in the Eastern Sprints.
The Black and White’s newest conference title rounds out its total Ivy championships to eight and is its first in nearly a decade.
Seeded fifth, Radcliffe came from behind to take the crown in thrilling fashion.
At the 1000-meter mark, No. 1 seeded Princeton held a slight edge over the Black and White. But Radcliffe quickly overtook the Tigers and maintained its lead the rest of the way, cruising into first place and seizing the 2012 title. The Black and White finished with a time of 6:17.74 seconds, 2.8 seconds ahead of second-place Cornell and more than four seconds ahead of the Tigers.
“I think we were right in it from the get-go,” says sophomore Jenna Gregorie, a member of the first varsity eight. “We followed our race plan, and it was just really exciting to be able to have that amazing performance all come together when it mattered at the end of the season.”
The winning eight were rowers Michelle Pearson, Lucy Grinalds, Liz Soutter, Mimi Tanski, Courtney Diekema, Scout Moran, Mary Maginnis, and Gregoire and coxswain Jill Carlson. For Gregoire, it was her second Ivy title on the year, the first of which she earned as a member of the Crimson’s women’s swimming and diving team.
Though Radcliffe claimed two of the three Ivy titles up for grabs Sunday, it was Princeton, which took the team title, besting the Black and White by three points for a total of 73 points on the weekend.
The Black and White’s achievement at the championships comes at the tail of a successful season in which the women trumped several national competitors.
LIGHTWEIGHTS
The Radcliffe lightweights kick-started the spring season with a splash, defeating No. 5 Georgetown by a wide margin of 11.35 seconds to seize the Class of 2004 Cup for the sixth time in eight years.
The lightweight 2V rounded out the weekend with another win, trumping Georgetown with an even greater 13-second gap.
In an invitational two weeks later featuring an elite crop of teams, Radcliffe came in third in the grand final, finishing behind Wisconsin and Stanford.
The following day, in the Muri Cup Regatta, the Black and White varsity and novice eights swept the MIT teams, finishing the weekend on a high note.
The Radcliffe lightweights ended their dual-regatta season with a momentous win over Princeton. The Black and White outstroked the Tigers by 3.1 seconds to earn the Class of 1999 Cup for the first time in three years. The novices also added a tally to the win column, ousting the Princeton boat by 1.2 seconds.
The Radcliffe lightweights then participated at the Eastern Sprints on May 13, with the varsity eight finishing in third place behind Wisconsin and Bucknell.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard football team generally sets two goals at the start of each season: to go a perfect 10-0 and to win an Ivy championship.
An ugly, 30-22 loss to Holy Cross in the year’s first contest rapidly rendered that first goal an impossibility. But with a dominant nine-game stretch to close the season, the Crimson made the second one a reality.
In addition to sweeping Lafayette and Bucknell, Harvard bested each of its seven Ivy League foes by no fewer than 10 points—punctuated by an emphatic 45-7 rout of Yale in The Game—to reclaim the Ivy crown for the first time since 2008.
“We just seemed to get better every week, and I think that’s the sign of a good team—a team that is playing their best football in November,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy says. “To win nine games straight was a really tough, resilient effort by our kids.”
In addition to Murphy’s 118th win as a Harvard coach against Columbia, which moved him into first place in the all-time Crimson wins list, the year also produced some of the top offensive performances in Harvard history.
Against Cornell, junior quarterback Colton Chapple threw for 414 yards, the second-highest total by any Crimson quarterback.
“That game [against Cornell] really showed us what we were able to do offensively, what the possibilities were for the next game,” Chapple says. “And I think we took that confidence and took that momentum into Bucknell and really for the rest of the season.”
After Chapple tossed five touchdowns a week later against Bucknell, tying another program high, senior Collier Winters stepped in the following week against Princeton. He followed with a record-tying performance of his own, throwing for five touchdowns and 403 yards against the Tigers.
And facing Dartmouth, Winters and running backs junior Treavor Scales and freshman Zach Boden each ran for over 100 yards, the first time any three Harvard players had accomplished that feat in the same game.
When all was said and done, the Crimson had accumulated 374 points over 10 games, the highest total of any Harvard team in the modern era.
“Probably the two best offensive teams we’ve had since we’ve been here have been the 2004 team with Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 and this season,” Murphy says.
But dominance was hardly the purview of the offense alone. Led by senior Josue Ortiz, who tallied 10 sacks en route to an Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year award, the Crimson defense was the stingiest in the Ancient Eight. The rush defense was particularly effective, limiting opponents to just 89.7 yards per game.
“[The 2004 and 2011 seasons] are the only two years in our 18-year tenure that the offense, the defense, and the special teams all ended up No. 1 in the Ivy League [based on our statistical analysis],” Murphy says. “And if you do that, you should win a championship.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s rare that a record-setting quarterback gets sent to the bench, but senior Collier Winters quickly made Harvard coach Tim Murphy’s decision to sit junior Colton Chapple in favor of the fifth-year senior look brilliant.
Coming into the 2011 campaign, it was all but assumed that Winters, the returning starter, would lead the Crimson attack, but a week-one matchup against Holy Cross forced the Harvard football team to change its plans.
In a 30-22 loss, Winters threw for 265 yards and two scores but also tossed two interceptions. In the fourth quarter, a scrambling Winters was brought down during a two-point conversion attempt when he heard a pop in his hamstring.
“At first, I didn’t think it was going to be that bad,” Winters says. “But throughout the rest of the fourth quarter it got really tight and pretty sore, and the next day it was tough to walk on.”
Throughout the ensuing week, Winters remained hopeful that he could start in the team’s next game, even if he was slightly injured. But he was never able to do much running, and it became clear that playing against Brown would not be a realistic possibility. Enter Chapple.
The junior had gained experience under center the previous year thanks to a Winters groin injury, and the Georgian quickly took advantage of his second big opportunity. In his first two games as a starter, Chapple led the squad to 24-7 and 31-3 victories over Brown and Lafayette, respectively, posting modest but solid passing numbers in the process. Then, with Winters still sidelined by injury, Chapple exploded in his following start the next week against Cornell.
Chapple amassed a whopping 414 passing yards and four touchdowns through the air in a 41-31 shootout. He followed that performance with a five-touchdown outing against Bucknell, in which he needed only 23 pass attempts to put the team up by 35 points.
Heading into that battle with the Bison, Winters said he was healthy again and ready to play. But Murphy thought otherwise and kept Chapple’s hot arm first on the depth chart, as he explained to Winters during the week.
“I thought that I was healthy enough to play, but I sat down and had a talk with Coach Murphy, and he said they were going to go with Colton for a few reasons—mainly because I wasn’t 100 percent and it wasn’t an Ivy League game,” Winters says. “It ended up being the right decision, even though I was itching to get back.”
After Chapple had put up historic numbers in back-to-back weeks, Murphy made the surprising decision to reinstate Winters as the No. 1 quarterback for the team’s next game at home against Princeton.
In advance of the game, the coaching staff was split on who should start, but Murphy was sure that he wanted Winters back under center. Beyond believing that Winters was a better quarterback, if only slightly, Murphy also decided on Winters based on how much the fifth-year senior had sacrificed to come back for another campaign, and because he didn’t want to punish Winters for getting hurt.
“If you put it all together, how much the kid had sacrificed, how much experience he had…he deserved to play by merit, and he certainly deserved to play by circumstance,” Murphy says.
Still, even the stadium announcer was caught off guard by the switch, incorrectly introducing Chapple as the starter before the game. Despite the adversity, Winters silenced potential critics of Murphy’s swap by matching, if not topping, Chapple’s previous two performances. In a 56-39 win, Winters threw for over 400 yards and five scores while completing more than 80 percent of his passes.
“He comes out and executed comfortably and almost flawlessly in the Princeton game,” Murphy says. “It takes a load off the coach when you come out and put up 56 points and almost 600 yards on the board.”
The known scrambler also added 30 yards and a touchdown on the ground, eliminating doubts about the strength of his hamstring.
“I had prepared for that game [and was] really just happy to be back playing football. It was a big game anyway, so I didn’t really try to put any more pressure on myself,” Winters says. “I was grateful to get my job back and ended up having a big game, so that took pressure off for the next week.”
Winters’ masterful return allowed him to regain control of a team undefeated in conference play. Winters would lead his squad to four more victories to close out the year at 9-1 as Ivy champions. On the year as a whole, Winters completed 68.6 percent of his passes, a single-season Harvard record.
“I thought he played tremendously down the stretch,” Murphy says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite just eking out wins against Yale and Princeton during the regular season, the Harvard women’s squash team was untouchable when it mattered most.
On the way to securing its second national title in three years—and 13th all-time—Harvard went 17-0, culminating in a victory over its Ancient Eight rival, the Bulldogs.
“The Howe Cup was when the team stepped up and really showed their courage, work, work ethic, and their abilities,” Crimson coach Mike Way says. “The results speak for themselves. It was just awesome.”
The final match of the 2012 CSA National Team Championships was not even close. The Crimson quickly separated itself from Yale, the No. 2 team in the nation, and carved out a decisive 8-1 victory at Barnaby Courts. The Bulldogs took home just five games to Harvard’s 24 on the day, as six Harvard players swept their respective Yale opponents.
“We were thrilled to sweep them off the court quickly,” freshman Haley Mendez says. “The older players especially were all really happy we were able to get revenge for last year’s loss.”
With the win, the Crimson also earned a taste of retribution in what was a rematch of last season’s title contest. The Bulldogs came out on top in 2010-11, sneaking by Harvard, 5-4, in the finals, thrashing any hopes of a repeat for the then-defending national champions.
But the Howe Cup was all Crimson this year. Before taking down Yale, Harvard dismantled No. 8 Dartmouth and No. 4 Trinity, both by scores of 9-0. The Crimson swept 16 of its 18 individual matches in the first two rounds of competition, allowing the Big Green and the Bantams to take home zero and four games, respectively.
And those are just the team-wide accomplishments.
Six Harvard players—more than any other college team—competed in the Ramsay Division of the 2012 CSA Individual Championships. The Crimson boasted three of eight quarterfinalists in co-captain Cece Cortes, junior Laura Gemmell, and freshman Amanda Sobhy.
Sobhy and Gemmell both advanced to the semifinals, and the freshman eventually claimed the individual championship with a dominant win over the defending titleholder, Yale’s Millie Tomlinson.
“Everyone I think was expecting Amanda to win, so that put a lot of pressure on her,” Mendez says. “It was great to see her respond to the pressure and win without dropping a single game.”
Five Harvard players were honored on All-America teams, with Sobhy and Gemmell earning first-team accolades, and Cortes, co-captain Nirasha Guruge, and Mendez garnering places on the second team.
“I don’t think we could have had a better season, between the Ivy League title, the national title, and the individual title,” Mendez says. “We have a great group of girls and really bonded well. I couldn’t have asked for a better freshman year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One game into the Harvard football team’s Ivy League title season, the Crimson’s course hardly looked promising.
Harvard had just dropped its first game against Holy Cross, and senior quarterback Collier Winters was already hurt.
His backup, junior Colton Chapple, had some experience as the third-stringer in 2010, but his time on the field was limited. Coming into its first league game against Brown with an 0-1 record and starting its second-string quarterback, it was an inauspicious start for Harvard.
Few could have predicted Chapple’s success.
The junior quarterback, in only four starts in 2011, matched or broke a series of long-standing passing records for the Crimson, and as Winters returned to health, Chapple placed himself squarely in the discussion as to who Harvard’s starting quarterback would be.
But in a move that was far from unanimous among the coaching staff, Winters returned to take back his old job, winning his final five collegiate starts en route to Harvard’s 7-0 league record.
Chapple, in his first two games of the season under center, led Harvard to a pair of convincing victories, first with a 24-7 win over Brown and then with a 31-3 blowout at Lafayette in Easton, Pa.
But in his next two games, Chapple had two of the best single-game performances for any quarterback in program history.
Playing at Cornell, he threw for four touchdowns and 414 yards, the second-highest total ever for a Crimson quarterback.
The next week against Bucknell, Chapple cemented his place in Harvard’s history books. He threw for five touchdowns, tying a record set by Carroll Lowenstein ’52-’54 in 1953.
And he did it in just over two quarters, coming out of the game early in the second half with the contest already well out of reach for Bucknell.
“By the time Bucknell rolled around, I realized that I could play in this league and that I could play at a high level,” Chapple says.
Before Chapple tied the mark on Oct. 15, Lowenstein’s record had stood for 58 years.
Not often does a record-setting performance land you on the pine, but the week after his five-touchdown game, Chapple was benched for the rest of the season. Winters promptly threw for five touchdowns against Princeton, becoming the second quarterback to accomplish the feat in as many weeks.
“I never expected to play when you have a fifth-year senior coming back from injury,” Chapple says. “We were able to battle it out in practice, and when it came down to it, the coaches—you have to respect their decision.”
While Chapple didn’t get the chance to finish the season, the year was still a huge step forward for the junior in the eyes of Harvard coach Tim Murphy.
“We became a ball control, running offense in the games that he played as a sophomore,” Murphy says. “Games as a junior, [we] didn’t change a thing—full speed ahead, full throttle, wide open offense.”
“We felt like regardless of what happens, we can win a championship,” Murphy adds. “We had the potential to win a championship with either guy.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Egyptian populace decided to revolt in early 2011, they knew their actions would bring about major changes in their country’s sociopolitical system. What they didn’t know is that nearly 1,400 miles away and 11 months in the future, their movement would spur a much smaller revolution—one in the sport of collegiate squash.
Such was the case because the events in his home country had spurred Ali Farag—the No. 1 junior player in the world and the No. 79 player overall—to emigrate to the United States in the fall of 2011.
After taking his SAT in May, Farag found out a month later that he had been accepted to Harvard as a transfer student from American University in Cairo, and just like that the Crimson men’s squash team had a new star.
“I was screaming on the phone, and my parents were crying,” Farag recalled about learning he had been accepted.
Beginning his collegiate squash career as a sophomore, Farag quickly made clear that he was no ordinary rookie. After sitting out the start of the season as the NCAA reviewed his eligibility, Farag swept Penn’s Thomas Mattsson in his first collegiate match. In his second, he downed the reigning CSA Individual Champion and the then-top-ranked player in the nation, Princeton’s Todd Harrity, in a five-game thriller. The sophomore was the first collegiate player to beat Harrity in two years.
“It was a really tough battle,” Farag said after the match. “My plan didn’t work [at first], so I had to find another plan to play, and fortunately it worked.”
Farag kept rolling from there, finishing an undefeated 16-0 in the regular season, and he entered the 32-player CSA national championship bracket as the top seed. Farag defeated Adam Perkiomaki of Rochester and teammate Brandon McLaughlin with ease in the first two rounds. Sweeps of a pair of Trinity players—Antonio Diaz in the quarters and three-time All-American Vikram Malhotra in the semis—put the Egyptian in the finals.
There, at the Alumni Gymnasium in Amherst, Mass., Farag was matched up with the tournament’s No. 2 seed, Columbia freshman Ramit Tandon, who had swept Harrity in the semis. Farag had not faced Tandon during the regular season but they had met before—most notably in the Junior British Open, which Farag won in January 2011.
Now playing for a collegiate national title, Tandon was looking to get retribution against the sophomore already considered the best junior player in the world.
The first game was tight, tied at three, four, nine, and 10 before Farag clinched a 12-10 win with a backhanded cross-court shot. Down 4-1 in the second, the sophomore fought back to pull out an 11-8 victory. And in the third game, Farag was as dominant as he had been all season, winning 11-4 to complete the sweep and earn Harvard its 34th CSA Individual National Championship and the Pool Trophy.
“[Farag] is a very exciting player with a beautiful touch and a lot of deception,” Harvard coach Mike Way said after the match. “His opponent plays a similar style…. It was beautiful squash, and hats off to both players. It was the most exciting finals that has ever been played.”
Farag, who had won a number of individual tournaments in the past, considered this championship even more special because he had triumphed while representing his new school.
“[Winning this title] was a bit different because I was playing for Harvard, not just for myself,” Farag said after the match. “Colin West [’10] won two years ago, and I wanted to get it back to Harvard this year.”
That Farag did, joining fellow rookie Amanda Sobhy as individual national champions in Cambridge.
“I think that they are probably the two strongest players ever to play in college squash,” Way said of his two national champions. “Some might disagree on the male side, because there have been some other very strong players. But there’s never been a male player as dominant and exciting as Ali.”
But it is not just Farag’s excellence on the court that has made his teammates thankful he joined the Crimson before the season began. The sophomore, an academic All-Ivy performer in the classroom, is a great teammate as well.
“Obviously, [Farag is] an incredible sportsman, but he’s also an incredible person,” freshman Nick Hopcroft says. “He’s genuinely one of the nicest people I’ve ever met. His passion for squash is inspiring to all of us.... It’s been amazing to be able to play with and learn from him. He’s a great person to talk to about your game.”
“He’s extremely humble, almost to a fault,” co-captain Will Ahmed adds. “He’s encouraging of his teammates, and he’s exactly the type of player that you’d want as your No. 1.”
With two years of eligibility left, only one questions remains: Where does Farag go from here?
“I don’t want to put pressure on him,” Ahmed said in March. “But you have to imagine that he’s in pretty good shape to [win the individual championships] the next two years, barring injuries or a player that no one’s heard of yet.”
“He’s an incredible talent,” Hopcroft adds. “I think he can go unbeaten for the rest of his college career.”
After captaining the Egyptian junior squash team to a world title in Quito, Ecuador in 2010, one goal of the CSA first-team All-American is to lead his new team to its first national championship since 1998 during his tenure in Cambridge. But if Farag has his way, his impact will go beyond Northeastern gymnasiums and extend all the way back to his home country.
“After the revolution, my parents took a different perspective talking to me about the issue of coming here,” Farag explained in February. “They told me to go there and learn something because there are not many Egyptians that come [to Harvard]. Then, come back...and try to do something for Egypt.”
No matter how many more individual titles he wins, one thing is clear: If Ali Farag can have anywhere near as significant an impact on his home country as he has had on the world of collegiate squash, that will certainly be his most important victory yet.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard softball team had a lot to live up to as it entered the 2012 season. Coming off a year in which it won the Ancient Eight title and swept the awards for Ivy League Rookie, Pitcher, and Player of the Year, all eyes were watching to see if the Crimson could pull off a repeat performance.
But despite a string of injuries and the loss of Ellen Macadam ’11, the reigning Ivy League Player of the Year, the Crimson managed to handle the pressure and repeat as Ancient Eight champions and leave its mark in the NCAA tournament.
“We definitely lost a huge player in Ellen Macadam,” says sophomore third baseman Kasey Lange. “But [senior infielder] Jane Alexander was so big in filling that spot. This team, especially the freshmen, stepped up huge as well, and thanks to everyone’s hard work, we didn’t take a step down from last year.”
Harvard finished the regular season with a 33-13 overall record, going 17-3 in Ivy play to earn its third consecutive North Division title. The team led the conference in batting average (.291), fielding percentage (.966), and ERA (1.84).
In championship play, the Crimson swept Penn in two games, winning Ivies for the second year in a row. Harvard allowed the Quaker offense a total of just two runs and seven hits, while the home team produced six runs and 15 hits of its own.
“A crowning moment was winning Ivies,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard says. “It was a huge goal, and if the team had not won this championship, it would’ve left a bad taste on their year. It really showed how well-rounded the team was, since the first championship game was won with great defense and pitching, and the second game was won with great offense.”
And, unlike last year, the team continued doing damage after leaving the Northeast with a conference title. The team lost its first tourney game against Washington but avoided elimination in back-to-back games the next day. With a 3-2 win against Maryland,  Harvard became the first Ivy squad sine 2005 to win a tournament game. It followed up that performance with a 2-0 victory over Texas Tech, the team that knocked the Crimson out of the 2011 tournament with a 7-0 win.
The victories set up a rematch with the Huskies in the Regional Final on May 20; back-to-back wins would propel an Ivy team into the Super Regionals round for the first time since 1996, when Princeton accomplished the feat.
But the Crimson fell to Washington, 4-0, bringing an end to the historic year.
Leading the Crimson defense this season were hurlers Rachel Brown and Laura Ricciardone. Brown is the squad’s KO machine, using the movement of her rise ball and changeup to strike out 232 batters in 2012, the best mark in the Ivy League.
Ricciardone, on the other hand, is a master of precision and holds Harvard’s all-time record for fewest walks allowed per seven-inning game (.81).
Together, the two pitchers provided Harvard with a one-two punch that blanked its opposition a total of 11 times this year.
But despite its eventual success, the road to the championship series was not always easy for the Crimson defense.
The infield suffered several losses this season, as sophomore catcher Ali Scott was out with a concussion, and Ricciardone had to miss a weekend of play due to a sprained ankle. Freshman catcher Katie Appelbe ultimately stepped in for Scott, and junior Jessica Ferri, senior Marika Zumbro, and rookie Gabrielle Ruiz filled the need in the bullpen.
“We were battling a lot of injuries, and for the team to step up and continue to win shows a lot of grit,” Allard says.
Before Harvard began to dominate at home, the squad completed a successful campaign on the road during spring break. In its first weekend of play, the team traveled south, nabbing two wins and suffering three losses in the South Florida tournament. The Crimson then went undefeated in five contests in the Northridge Classic and won four of five games played in San Diego, Calif.
“We faced really tough pitching in California, which definitely prepared us for the rest of the season, especially Ivies,” Lange says.
Yet the Harvard squad did not have the smoothest start to the regular season.
Once back on the East Coast, the Crimson split its first four-game series against Lehigh before falling to Bryant by nine runs. That would end up being the largest margin that the team would lose by and the most runs that an opposing squad would score against the Harvard defense.
In its opening weekend of Ivy League play, the Crimson split a doubleheader against Cornell, losing the second contest, 10-8.
But after the rough patch, Harvard began to find its groove and play with greater consistency.
In its remaining 18 conference matches, Harvard lost only twice more, both times to North Division rival Dartmouth. Its second loss to the Big Green was also its last contest of the regular season, after which it would come back to sweep Penn for the Ivy League title in Cambridge.
“This year, we had individual players improve, and then, as a team, we really worked on being consistent,” Allard says. “This team’s success despite its obstacles was just characteristic of how strong it is, how much depth we had, how people who weren’t starting all the time were still working hard in practice. We were truly 21 strong.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Squash is, by nature, an individual sport. But with the CSA Team National Championships on the line, the veterans of Harvard women’s squash team (17-0, 7-0 Ivy) showed how crucial the team aspect can be to a successful season.
Facing its biggest rival and defending national champion Yale, co-captain Nirasha Guruge got the team off to a hot start by dropping her opponent in a quick, three-game match. With the immediate boost of confidence, the team stormed out to a 4-1 lead as Guruge’s co-captain, Cece Cortes, battled for the decisive fifth victory. And when Yale’s Katherine Ballaine hit the tin to give Cortes the match and the national title, Cortes walked off the court into a huddle of her teammates to celebrate the journey they had completed.
Although the Crimson was the favorites for the title all year, the season was not without its obstacles. Players noted that the pressure to succeed can often be a burden, but Cortes believes her team was well equipped to handle the target on their backs.
“Our best asset was that we had some extremely mentally-tough freshmen and some upperclassmen who had developed their game over a long period of time,” Cortes says. “So when you have that kind of talent coming in and that veteran savvy at the top of the age group, you’re bound to succeed regardless of how tough it is.”
The season began flawlessly as the squad wrapped up its non-conference schedule with seven straight wins, taking the matches by a combined score of 59-4. The lineup fluctuated greatly during this time as players attempted to come back from injury.
But perhaps the biggest name missing from the team sheet was Amanda Sobhy. The freshman, currently ranked No. 29 in the professional squash circuit, sat poised to take the college squash world by storm. But Sobhy was required by the Ivy League to sit out the first 30 percent of the season. The same restrictions were placed on Ali Farag, the No. 1 player on Harvard’s men’s team.
Sobhy’s debut came just in time for the beginning of Ivy League play, as the team hosted Penn and Princeton. Sobhy dominated Penn captain Nabilla Ariffin to get her first college win, and the team took a 7-2 victory.
The next day did not prove to be as simple as the team faced its first hurdle against Princeton. The Crimson found itself down 4-0 in the middle of the second cycle of play.
“We were quite a nervous team because we had the world of expectations on our back,” Harvard coach Mike Way says.
The Crimson managed to win the next four matches to draw even with the Tigers. The decisive match fell into the hands of  freshman Haley Mendez, who promptly dropped her first two games. The rookie clawed her way back into the match with a 14-12 victory and then turned on the jets, beating Princeton’s Alexis Saunders in the final two games, 11-3 and 11-2.
“They pulled through that one by the skin of their teeth,” Way says. “I really think that was the beginning of something.”
Harvard ran through Ivy play without dropping a game before facing the year’s toughest task: taking on defending national champion Yale in New Haven, Conn.
As with Princeton, the Crimson found itself in a hole, down, 4-2, entering the final cycle of play.
But victories from Sobhy, junior Sarah Mumanachit, and Mendez snatched the Ivy title away from Yale, and gave Harvard the momentum heading into the Howe Cup final two weeks later.
Cortes had faith in her team’s final-round lineup.
“Sarah has developed so much since freshman year, and Haley and Amanda barely needed any coaching,” Cortes says. “They already have what it takes to win at the top.”
Despite claiming the Ivy title from its rival, Way knew his team had much more to give. And his team seemed to believe it too, as two hard weeks of preparation sent the Crimson into the Howe Cup and got it past the first two rounds against Dartmouth and Trinity without dropping a match. In the finals, the squad found itself facing Yale again, this time for the national crown.
But unlike the previous matchup, Harvard dominated from beginning to end, taking the program’s 13th national title in the process.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming into the 2011 season, Tim Murphy had already put together a sterling resume in his 17 years as the head coach of the Harvard football team. Five Ivy League titles. 111 wins. Two unbeaten and untied seasons.
And with his team’s performance this past year, Murphy cemented his place as one of, if not the greatest coach in Crimson football history.
After an early loss to Holy Cross, Harvard swept its next nine games, giving Murphy his sixth Ivy League title. In the process, Murphy earned his 118th win at Harvard, making him the winningest coach in program history.
“He’s pretty much a universally respected figure because all he really does is win,” says freshman running back Zach Boden.
And the man who opened the eyes of current Buffalo Bills quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 to his potential in the NFL, the coach whose frank discussion with senior Josue Ortiz following the 2008 season marked a turning point in his career, seemed to have all the answers again in 2011.
When talking with Ortiz in the spring of 2011 about whether the All-American should return in the fall to play as a fifth-year senior, Murphy told his star defensive tackle, “‘Josue, I really believe that you’re going to be the Player of the Year in the Ivy League. I think that’s the kind of potential you have.’”
Just as Murphy had hoped, Ortiz returned to play in 2011. And just as Murphy had predicted, Ortiz was named the Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year, terrorizing  offensive lines and quarterbacks around the Ancient Eight.
Anchored by Ortiz and his 10 sacks against constant double teams, the Crimson defense yielded just 17.1 points per game, the best in the Ivy League.
Murphy also decided to deviate from his normal offense and used two tight ends rather than just one. He hoped to incorporate both junior Kyle Juszczyk and sophomore Cam Brate— “among our most valuable and versatile athletes,” Murphy says—into the offense.
But even the 25-year head coach was taken aback by how well the change worked.
“I can’t say for a second that I knew it would work out, that it would be the highest scoring offense in school history, and those guys would team up for almost 80 catches and 14 touchdowns,” Murphy says.
The two tight ends combined for 898 yards in the season’s 10 games, helping the Crimson offense to a modern-era record 374 points.
Midway through the season, Murphy was faced with one of his toughest decisions of the year: starting junior Colton Chapple, who had just completed perhaps the greatest two-game stretch any Crimson quarterback has ever had, or previous starter and fifth-year senior Collier Winters, who was returning from injury.
“[It was] definitely not unanimous [among the coaching staff]. It was very much split,” Murphy recalls of the decision. “But I knew what I wanted to. I knew it was going to be Collier quite frankly even before I asked the staff, because at the end of the day, that’s what you’re paid to do. You’re paid to make the decision you feel most comfortable with.”
Getting the coach’s vote of confidence, Winters vindicated Murphy’s decision, throwing for 403 yards and five touchdowns against Princeton while leading Harvard to 214 points in its final five games.
But Murphy wasn’t quite finished with a season that will certainly go down as a candidate for his magnum opus. After the Crimson topped Penn to secure the Ivy championship, the coach wasn’t satisfied: If they didn’t beat Yale, he told his players, then no one would get a ring.
“That was the deal,” Boden says with a laugh. “It was definitely a persuasive argument.”
The Crimson dominated Yale in The Game, routing the Bulldogs, 45-7. The victory marked Harvard’s fifth straight win over Yale.
According to his players, part of the secret of Murphy’s long-run success, in addition to consistently recruiting talented athletes, is his combination of a deep knowledge of the game and a highly disciplined approach.
“I don’t think anybody works harder than Coach Murphy week in and week out,” Chapple says. “He almost runs the program like a business, and as soon as we get down to practice, it’s two hours of nothing but straight business, and you better be focused for that time.”
“I’ve never met a man who knows more about the game of football,” Boden adds. “It’s unreal. He knows every nuance, everything.”
And in a sense, Murphy’s years of work culminated near the year’s end, before the Ivy title, when Murphy passed long-time coach Joe Restic to become the winningest coach in Harvard history.
Then, following the season’s conclusion, Murphy—who took a 40 percent pay cut when he left Cincinnati in 1994 to come to Cambridge—received a job offer from a Football Bowl Subdivision school and was rumored to be an early favorite for the Penn State opening.
But in the end, Murphy elected to stay at the place where he had made history.
“At the time, I thought I felt good about the decision [to stay] in my gut,” Murphy says. “You look back, and it was a great decision…. The kids we work with here are among the toughest, hardest working, classiest kids I’ve ever been around. And, we really feel like if we work our butts off, and we work smart, that we have a chance to succeed on a regular basis.”
And in his 18 years at the helm of the Crimson, including a memorable 2011 campaign, Murphy has done just that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the help of a coach on the rise, Harvard squash may be the Way of the future for many years to come.
Mike Way, who coaches both the men’s and women’s squash teams, had both squads among the best in the nation in 2012. The women’s team finished 17-0 and won the CSA Team National Championship, its second in the last three years; and the men’s squad ended the season at 16-4, with a third-place finish in the CSA Team Championships, its highest since 2007.
Though he has been around the sport for most of his life, Way’s position with the Crimson is a new one. After spending much of the past three decades coaching squash in various capacities in Canada, Way moved to Cambridge in 2010 to accept his first job in the U.S. college ranks.
“It’s a different challenge, and I’m growing into it,” Way says. “But I would use the word ‘relish.’ I’m relishing the challenge and enjoying it. Each month I get into it more, [and] I enjoy it more.”
This season, his second at Harvard, Way had the luxury of coaching the top two individual squash players in the country. Sophomore Ali Farag won the CSA Individual National Championship on the men’s side, while freshman Amanda Sobhy duplicated the feat in the women’s tournament.
“I’ve coached world champions and other elite players, and there have been a lot of titles in there, but this might be the best job of the lot,” Way says.
With such elite talent, the mental aspect of the sport often becomes just as important as the physical side, something that, according to women’s co-captain Cece Cortes, Way was able to manage with ease.
“He is the kind of coach who takes on his players as an entire person,” Cortes says. “He doesn’t shy away from working out people’s mental games, and for a lot of coaches, that is tough to do because you mess with your players in a way beyond technique.”
Cortes believes that, given his ability to combine his long experience in the sport with a propensity for teaching, the success Way and the Crimson achieved in 2011-12 is a harbinger of good things to come in the future.
“It’s an individual sport so you often find coaches who can connect with one or two people, but Mike has proven to connect with all types of players,” Cortes says. “I think that says a lot for him in terms of his longevity at Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An unrepentant packrat, I am now enduring the final edition of an annual ritual: the trashing of journalistic detritus. Packets of post-game statistics, media guides, yellowing copies of The Crimson—all warrant a moment of nostalgia before heading off into oblivion by way of recyclable container.
I do allow myself to hold onto a single guilty pleasure: my press credentials. Some are more cherished than others (Dear Cornell Athletics, Who is “Dennis Zhung”?). The most meaningful of all was also the last one to enter the collection. About the size of a postcard, its blue laminated plastic reads, “NCAA 2012 BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP.”
March Madness is unquestionably the Mount Everest of college sports journalism, and after years of exploring the cozy gyms of the Ivy League, I finally reached the peak. The all-access pass gave me just about everything I could have ever wanted, from a press conference seat to bottomless cups of soda.
But even now, I cannot shake the sense that I did very little to earn that credential. Without the help of an incredible number of parties, it surely would not have existed, let alone been mine to flaunt.
What follows, then, is an assuredly incomplete expression of my gratitude to the folks who truly deserve it.
*****
I owe no small amount of thanks to The Crimson’s Business board, which somehow helped fund my travels to Boone, N.C.; the Bahamas; and Albuquerque, N.M. No thanks for the trips to Ithaca.
Next up is the man himself, Jeremy Lin ’10—deserving of mention not only for hitting the most incredible shot I’ve ever witnessed live (see: William and Mary, 2009) but also for allowing me into his Bible study two years ago. We had previously only spoken in sound bites, but Lin never even batted an eye at my request. Week in and week out, I headed to his room in Leverett House, sat on his futon, and questioned him about God instead of basketball.
I likely owe the most thanks of all to whomever or whatever it was that secured me the men’s basketball beat as a freshman in the Class of 2012, allowing me a first-class seat on one of the most exciting rides this institution has ever seen. But this particular piece of writing would be wasted without devoting space to the man upstairs.
Indeed, I have more than once uttered the blasphemic phrase, “What Would Tommy Amaker Do (WWTAD)?” We basketball writers jest about the man whose office sits on the second floor of Lavietes Pavilion, but our humor only works because it is rooted in the truth—that this story would not exist if not for the decision of an unemployed man in 2007.
This is a man who, contrary to popular belief, no longer wears turtlenecks, though he does seem to recycle the same orphaned suit jackets every weekend. A man who once attended my House faculty dinner as my guest. A man I hope will never leave Cambridge.
*****
It must first be said that Tommy Amaker is an awful quote. Years of interacting with national media have trained him well to deal with greenhorn college journalists. Amaker has mastered the art of filling voice recorders while managing to say little of substance. One could design a full-fledged game of press conference Bingo around his standby phrases.
It might seem strange, then, for a reporter to praise him.
To fully explain, I must return to Dec. 4, 2008, when Boston University came to Lavietes. That evening, the Terriers soared above the rim from the first layup line, and the visitors’ athleticism helped them run away with a 16-point blowout.
It was my first time covering Harvard men’s basketball. I didn’t dress up. I took sloppy notes. And I sat next to the legendary Bob Ryan, who wasn’t impressed with the Crimson at all.
Accordingly, I had no appreciation for my reporting duties. Why trudge over to the far side of campus simply to see this, I thought.
My other early memory of sportswriting was the first weekly media session I attended. Amaker, in fact, asked me the opening question: “Where are you from?” It turns out that college basketball recruiting helps one develop an extensive knowledge of U.S. geography.
In the years since, I’ve had the chance to speak with Amaker outside the confines of the press credential, with the tape recorder shut off, on a number of occasions. It was in these moments of rare candor that Harvard basketball’s transformation became wholly unsurprising to me.
Outsiders may take issue with the man and his methods, but it is difficult to remain a cynic when he looks you in the eye and describes his long-term vision for the program, all the while cultivating a unique atmosphere of mutual respect for even a newbie reporter.
Six semesters after we first met, I saw Mr. Ryan in Albuquerque, where we both were donning those treasured blue pieces of plastic. Though it hit a bump in that second-round matchup, Harvard’s rise is nowhere near over. As I have tracked for the past four years, the stud recruits have come, and I expect them to keep coming—as long as you-know-who is at the helm.
*****
The Parting Shot usually consists of a rumination on Harvard sports and life. For the folks on The Crimson’s Sports board, the two are commonly one and the same—a philosophy of which my post-graduate plans may be the purest expression.
Along with two of my classmates, I have founded the African Sports and Scholastic Initiative for Students in Townships, a project combining the growing sport of basketball with academic mentoring and support to empower the youth of Alexandra, a Johannesburg slum.
After a foray into sportswriting—and one failed cameo at an Amaker coaching clinic—I’ll now be the one carrying clipboards and blowing whistles. My pupils may not have the vertical leap of a Kyle Casey or the quick hands of a Brandyn Curry, but they will match them in heart—and then some.
Something tells me that I’m not finished asking, “What would Tommy Amaker do?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a disappointing end to a season in which the Harvard men’s lacrosse team never gained the momentum it had hoped for. After dropping its first two chances to clinch a spot in the Ivy League Tournament with losses against Penn and Princeton, the Crimson had one last opportunity in its regular-season finale at Yale.
But the Bulldogs prevailed in a closely contested game, and, just like that, Harvard’s season was done. It was a disappointing finish for a team that held preseason aspirations of competing in the NCAA Tournament in late May.
Despite returning 10 of 11 starters from a 10-6 squad in 2011 and bringing in what was regarded as potentially the best Ivy League recruiting class in a decade, the Crimson found itself on the losing end of multiple closely fought games. Four of the team’s eight losses, including its final loss to Yale, came by two goals or fewer.
After a promising 2-0 start to Ivy-League play, Harvard stumbled and was unable to find a win in any of its final four league contests. The most frustrating of those games may have been a mid-April, two-goal loss to Penn, a squad that, at the time, had just one win on the year.
But it was not a season without highlights. Senior attackman Jeff Cohen, the nation’s second-ranked goal scorer at just under 3.5 per game, recorded the seventh best scoring season in Harvard history en route to becoming the Crimson’s all-time leader in career goals, finishing  his four-year career with 142 tallies.
Cohen was recently named to the All-Ivy First Team, as was tri-captain Kevin Vaughan. Vaughan, who was drafted in the second round (14th overall) of the Major League Lacrosse draft earlier this year, finished his senior campaign as the squad’s second leading scorer, tallying 17 goals and a team-best 19 assists.
Sophomore attackman Daniel Eipp, whose 24 goals this season were second only to Cohen, also earned postseason acknowledgement with a spot on the All-Ivy Second Team.
After beginning the year ranked as high as 14th in the nation, Harvard cruised to wins against Vermont in its season opener and at Holy Cross three days later.
But the Crimson came up short in each of its next three non-conference games. Harvard failed to exact revenge against a Hofstra team that defeated it in 2011, as the squad fell again, 7-6. The final deficit was the same in Harvard’s next game at Georgetown, with the Hoyas dropping the Crimson to 2-2 overall. A matchup with perennial power Duke went no better, as Harvard lost by three goals and found itself below .500 heading into Ivy play.
A thrilling overtime win against Brown at home put the Crimson back on track. Harvard coasted to a 15-10 win over Dartmouth at home the following week to stay undefeated in the Ivy League.
Harvard was brought back down to earth in a 16-8 loss to at the hands of then-No. 2/3 UMass, but bounced back resoundingly with a convincing win over Michigan four days later.
Standing at 5-4, the Crimson travelled to Cornell for what many players had tabbed as the team’s biggest game of the year. But Harvard was unable to avenge its defeat in the 2011 Ivy League Championship game as Cornell cruised to a 14-10 win.
The Crimson bounced back three days later with an 18-4 thumping of Quinnipiac, and stood at 6-5 heading into its final three games, all Ivy contests. A win in any one would have guaranteed Harvard a postseason spot, but the efforts of Penn, Princeton, and Yale proved more than the Crimson could overcome.
“We’re obviously not satisfied with the final record,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said after his team’s final game, “but the amount of work and effort from these guys has been tremendous, and it’s something to be proud of.”
The Crimson seemed to play better in the comfort of familiar surroundings this year, dropping only two of its seven contests at home. On the flip side, Harvard struggled on the road, its only win coming at Holy Cross early in the season.
Neither the offense nor the defense was especially prolific from a statistical standpoint. The Cohen-led offense finished among the nation’s top 25 at 10.36 goals per game. The defense, anchored by tri-captain Paul Pate, lost a key piece when MLL-draftee senior Daniel DiMaria suffered a season-ending injury early in the year and finished in the middle of the pack nationally, allowing an average of just under 9.8 goals per contest.
Harvard will be hit hard by graduation this spring. Besides losing its top two scorers in Cohen and Vaughan, it will be forced to replace Pate and fellow tri-captian Terry White.
“It’s interesting,” Cohen says. “You spend such a small portion of time playing in actual games. Most of my memories will be of the hard work with my teammates, the great times we had on and off the field.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team won a program-record 26 games this season, but the squad’s most significant contest was really one it lost.
Indeed, the importance of the Crimson’s March 15 game against Vanderbilt went far beyond what the scoreboard read when the final buzzer sounded: Vanderbilt 79, Harvard 70. Just the fact that the Crimson had made it to the NCAA tournament—somewhere it had not been since 1946, when what is now the Big Dance was less important than the NIT—meant that the squad had finally achieved one of its longstanding goals.
“It [was] just a dream come true,” co-captain Keith Wright said after the game. “We’ve put a lot of time, blood, sweat, and tears into this basketball program.... Unfortunately we didn’t come out with a victory, but this is something that we’re going to carry with us the rest of our lives. It’s a stage where not many players get to play, and we are definitely grateful for that.”
The game marked a summit of a five-year climb for the program under coach Tommy Amaker, who took a squad that went 8-22 in his first season and four years later had it playing under college basketball’s brightest lights.
It marked a reason for celebration for a fan base that for so long had accepted mediocrity, one that could now proudly cheer for its own school when the calendar turned to March.
It marked, for students and alumni who might otherwise place no importance on athletics, a reason for interest and participation—either by watching at home on TNT, or by traveling to attend the second-round game in Albuquerque, N.M., as many did (including some members of the 1946 squad).
And for the team itself, from the seniors who had worked toward that very stage for four long years to the freshmen on their first spring break, the contest marked the ability to play in a basketball game of a magnitude none of their predecessors had experienced before.
“It was a great experience for all of us,” junior point guard Brandyn Curry says. “March Madness is one of the biggest sporting events in the world. We all grew up watching it; to finally be there, be in the moment and experience it, was a dream come true at least for me, and I know for a lot of other guys as well.”
“It was crazy,” classmate Christian Webster adds. “Just walking out of the tunnel and seeing that big screen and the floor, it was everything I’d dreamed about playing for in college. It was unbelievable.”
For those reasons, the game’s importance went far beyond the final result. But the contest’s significance was not hurt by the fact that it was also quite a match.
The teams dueled evenly early on, and the Crimson even took a lead at 20-17 on a Webster three with 5:28 to go in the first half.
But Vanderbilt’s Jeffery Taylor answered right back with a long ball of his own, and the Commodores closed the half on a 16-3 run—capped by a Brad Tinsley three at the buzzer—to take a 10-point lead into the break.
“We could’ve played a lot better,” Curry says. “That run really, really killed us.”
The Crimson came out sluggish in the second, with Curry turning it over and junior forward Kyle Casey missing a dunk, and the Commodores took advantage by building a 62-44 lead with 7:49 to go.
But that was when the Crimson made its run.
Within 90 seconds, a Casey dunk, Casey three, and Curry layup had the deficit down to 11. After Vanderbilt answered to go up 67-51, sophomore forward Laurent Rivard drilled back-to-back tough threes—he finished six-of-seven from deep for a team-high 20 points—and Curry hit a layup to cut the lead to nine with 3:30 remaining in the game.
Two Wright free throws would get the Crimson within five, 70-65, with 1:51 to go, and Harvard had the chance to make it a one-possession game. But senior guard Oliver McNally lost the ball out of bounds, and the Crimson never got closer than that.
“I thought we were going to come back,” McNally said afterward. “We made a great run.”
In the end, Harvard’s nine-point loss to the SEC tournament champions—who had knocked off future national title winner Kentucky a week earlier—was a respectable one.
“This is a huge step for our program,” Wright said after the game. “We’re leaving our mark here on the University and the basketball program itself.”
But for the players who got to achieve their dream of playing on college basketball’s biggest stage, it only left them wanting more.
“It hurts to lose, [and] it left a bitter taste in our mouths, but the whole experience was great,” Curry says. “We’re just hungry to get back.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“It definitely hasn’t hit me full blast yet,” Melanie Baskind says as she sits at a table in the lobby of Quincy House wearing a crimson “Harvard Soccer” shirt and one of her three Ivy League championship rings.
It’s exactly a week after the Harvard women’s lacrosse team’s loss to Penn in the first round of the Ivy League tournament brought an end to the Crimson’s 2012 season. But the 9-5 defeat ended more than that; it also marked the end of an era.
For four years, Melanie Baskind has dominated the Ivy League.
On the lacrosse and soccer pitches, she’s played in 115 games, handed out 44 assists, and scored 115 goals. She’s served as a team captain on three occasions, won three Ivy League championships, and been named to seven All-Ivy teams.
In her four years in a Crimson uniform, Baskind has accomplished quite a bit, but her final season was the most impressive.
On the soccer field, Baskind captained Harvard to its third Ivy League championship in four years, scoring a conference-high eight goals along the way. After the season, she was unanimously voted the Ivy League Player of the Year and selected to the All-Ivy First Team for the second straight season.
But Baskind’s year didn’t end there. For the third time, Baskind—a standout three-sport athlete while at nearby Framingham  High School—suited up for the women’s lacrosse team in the spring.
In her second season as women’s lacrosse captain, Baskind played a crucial role on both sides of the field for a Crimson squad that went 5-2 in the Ivy League. On the offensive end, she finished second on the team with 27 goals and first with six assists. On the defensive end, she was first on the team in caused turnovers (15), second in ground balls (37), and third in draw controls (22).
“She’s a dynamic player,” says Ellen Gleason, Baskind’s co-captain on the lacrosse team. “She’s all over the field.”
Just three years ago, though, Baskind wasn’t even sure she could make the team. After being a two-time All-American in lacrosse in high school, Baskind decided to give up the sport when she came to Harvard, choosing to focus on soccer instead.
But after her freshman year, during which she was named Ivy League Rookie of the Year in soccer, Baskind had an itch to return to the lacrosse field.
“I felt like if I didn’t try it given the fact that I had the opportunity, it was something I would always wonder [about] looking back,” she says.
After getting approval from women’s soccer coach Ray Leone, Baskind opted to give lacrosse a shot in her sophomore year.
At first, the 5’3” midfielder experienced quite a bit of uncertainty.
“I didn’t know what my stick skills would look like,” she recalls. “I didn’t even know if I would make the team.”
But it didn’t take long for her new teammates to realize she belonged.
“The second she stepped on the field we had an instant respect for her,” then-freshman Jennifer VanderMeulen told The Crimson in 2010.
Baskind made it clear why in her first lacrosse campaign. The sophomore started every game for the Crimson, finishing second on the team in scoring and first in ground balls and caused turnovers. After the season, she transitioned back into soccer mode, getting into shape for the start of the fall season, a process she repeated her junior and senior years.
But when the Harvard women’s soccer team returns to Cambridge this coming August, Baskind—for the first time in four years—will be far away.
“It’s really hard to come to terms with,” she says. “I definitely haven’t done it yet. I’m not sure when it will hit me. I’m a little scared for when it does.”
Not only will she be far from Cambridge, Baskind will be far away from the world of competitive athletics.
After graduation, the neurobiology concentrator will be spending the next year volunteering at hospitals and orphanages in Kenya and Uganda.
But Baskind won’t be completely separating herself from soccer. In fact, she will be working under the NGO Coaches Across Continents, which uses soccer to promote social change in developing countries.
“The power of soccer is huge. I’m excited to use it for different purposes,” Baskind says. “You hear about the potential to be a role model for young girls in developing countries. It’s hard to say no.”
When she returns to the United States after her year abroad, Baskind plans on attending medical school where she is thinking of specializing in pediatrics.
But she will not be completely abandoning athletics. While in Africa, she plans on climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro and is looking forward to playing in co-ed leagues when she returns to the United States.
“It will be a part of my life forever, but in a different way,” she says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2011, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team surrendered 10.25 goals per game, fourth best in the Ivy League. In one year’s time, the Crimson cut that average to 7.81, giving it the fifth best defense in the nation.
Part of Harvard’s success on defense can be explained by the addition of freshman goaltender Kelly Weis, who displayed a natural ability to coordinate the Crimson defense. The rookie finished the year with a .474 save percentage, second best in the Ivy League and 14th best in the country.
Weis was recognized for her performance this year by receiving an honorable mention to the All-Ivy team.
“Kelly is an amazing goalie,” junior attacker Jennifer VanderMeulen says. “She just stepped right on to the field and took the role as leader of the defense early on. Normally it takes a while to get acclimated to the college game, but Kelly just kind of eased right in and transitioned beautifully.”
“The level of her play and the intensity she brought, especially in close games, led to the number of close games we won,” co-captain Melanie Baskind echoes. “[The defense’s success] wouldn’t have happened without her.”
According to her teammates, one of the keys to Weis’ success was her ability to communicate with her teammates.
“She knows what to say and when to say it,” VanderMeulen says. “Everyone on the defensive end listened to her. The way she is able to direct the defense is huge. It helped us improve defensively 100 percent.”
After some early season struggles, Harvard was able to turn its season around thanks in large part to the play of Weis and the rest of the defense. In the Crimson’s final three Ivy League regular season matchups, Weis stopped 22 of the 36 shots she faced.
“She just comes up with big saves,” Baskind says. “Every time you think it’s an open net and it’s going to be an easy goal for the other team, she comes out of nowhere and makes the save. She also forces teams to shoot less by making them think more.”
After Weis’ strong freshman campaign, the Crimson will look to the goalie to continue to anchor its defense for the next three seasons.
“She didn’t play like a freshman, which is what we needed,” Baskind says. “I am so excited to see what she will accomplish in the future.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After failing to win a tournament in a 2010-11 season marked by three second-place finishes, the Harvard women’s golf team came charging back in 2011-12 with five first-place finishes over the course of this season.
And even under blustery conditions, the Crimson was able to achieve its ultimate goal of becoming champions of the Ivy League. Harvard beat out Penn and Yale, who had taken the first-place crown from the Crimson last year, in order to claim its position atop the Ancient Eight for the first time in three years.
“Winning Ivies was definitely the highlight of our season,” freshman Tiffany Lim says. “That’s what we work for every year. If we win Ivies, we consider the whole year a success.”
Harvard’s victory at the championships gave the team a spot at the NCAA Central Regional Tournament. Coming in, the Crimson was ranked 22 out of 24 teams, but with a final score of 943 (+79), Harvard placed 18th.
Along with their championship victory, the Crimson’s players earned a number of individual accolades.
Lim, who was ranked sixth in the nation by Golfweek Magazine in the preseason, earned the title of Ivy League Rookie of the Year. Coming in ninth at the Ivy League Championship, Lim went on to finish 23rd at the NCAA Central Regional tournament. Shooting a 227 (+11), Lim was only five strokes short of individually qualifying for the NCAA finals.
Sophomore Bonnie Hu won a position on the All-Ivy First Team. Hu, who is also a Crimson business editor, earned first place individually at the Ivy League Championships with a score of 225 (+12). Senior Jane Lee, along with Lim, also earned an All-Ivy Second Team nod.
Harvard came out of the gate strong with a first-place finish in its first tournament of the season, the Yale Intercollegiate. The Crimson’s score of 894 (+30) gave Harvard a 16-stroke edge over second-place Longwood University. Lim tied Yale’s Seo Hee Moon for first place individually, shooting a 218 (+2).
The Crimson did not slow down in its next contest either.
Harvard took first place once again with a team score of 906 (+42) at the Princeton Women’s Invitational, and Lim continued her breakout success with another event win.
The rookie posted the low score in each of the three rounds to finish with a 213 (-3).
But the win streak was snapped at the Nittany Lion Invitational, where the Crimson finished ninth. Lim was the top Harvard golfer in the scores, notching 15th place with a 151 (+7).
“I think we remained pretty consistent throughout the whole year,” Lim says. “A couple of tournaments were stronger than others, but we still performed how we wanted to. In the stronger tournaments, we may not have won, but we came out stronger players.”
The team had its last fall tournament at its own Harvard Invitational, where it tied for second place with Columbia. Hu came in second individually with a score of 155 (+11), while Lim finished a shot behind Hu to place third.
And after the winter break, it didn’t take long for the Crimson to regain its momentum.
“The team did a really good job with getting into competition mode after a long winter season,” captain Christine Cho says. “Everyone did a good job with adjusting quickly.”
The Crimson entered the spring season with an 11-stroke win against Nova Southeastern. Harvard then travelled to compete in the Rebel Intercollegiate tournament and placed 10th against a tough field. Hu earned the top individual score for the team, 230 (+14).
The Roar-EE Invitational was the Crimson’s final regular season tournament before the Ivy League Championships. Harvard took first, beating second-place Columbia by six strokes. Lee paced the Crimson with a 145 (+1), good for second place. Freshman Brenna Nelsen followed in sixth place, and Lim came in at 14th.
Harvard rode this first-place momentum to victory at the Ivy League Championships.
“We take a lot of pride in what we did and what we have done,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads says. “I think we will continue to be more and more competitive every year. We have to be a little bit more efficient than everyone else, but I think the girls are motivated to do that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the end of his fourth season at the helm of the Harvard men’s basketball team, Tommy Amaker had accomplished a feat no other Crimson coach had managed to do: lead Harvard to an Ivy League title.
One year later, the accolades continued to roll in. Harvard won a program-best 26 games in 2011-12 on the way to its second straight Ancient Eight Crown—the team’s first solo championship.
And with that came the end of a 66-year NCAA tournament drought. Amaker and the Crimson journeyed to Albuquerque, N.M., and subsequently fell to SEC champs Vanderbilt in the first round.
Despite the loss, history continues to be made with Amaker leading the charge.
“He’s a great coach because he’s a great leader,” says junior point guard Brandyn Curry. “He is definitely by far one of the best leaders I’ve ever seen, just in terms of being able to control the team and being able to admit when he’s wrong…. He listens to us when we have something to say. His office is always open.”
Since the former Duke All-American arrived on the scene in 2007, Harvard has steadily improved. From a 3-11 effort in conference play in 2007-08 the Crimson became the clear favorite to win the 2011-12 Ivy title.
Harvard led the league in scoring defense, with opponents averaging 55.6 points per game—a full 6.5 points fewer than any other Ivy team. And according to Crimson players, Amaker is a big reason for Harvard’s defensive prowess.
“Coach always preaches, ‘defense, defense, defense,’” junior wing Christian Webster says. “That’s one of the things we pride ourselves on. Coach does a good job of making us take pride in getting stops.”
Harvard won the inaugural Battle 4 Atlantis tournament to kick off the season, taking down Utah, then-No. 22 Florida State, and Central Florida in the process.
The Crimson saw time in the Associated Press and ESPN/USA Today Coaches Poll rankings, coming in as high as No. 21. And although it took until the last game of Ivy play—a Tuesday-night matchup between Princeton and then-championship hopeful Penn—Harvard made good on early predictions to capture its second straight league crown.
“[Amaker] knows the game of basketball,” Curry says. “Not only did he play at Duke, he’s one of the best college point guards there ever was, so he’s been there, he’s done that at a very high level…. Everybody has really embraced his vision and embraced his style of play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Heading into the final weekend of the 2012 season, the Harvard baseball team was still in control of its own destiny—win its next four games and the Crimson would force a one-game playoff for a berth in the Ivy League Championship Series.
Though sweeping Dartmouth in back-to-back doubleheaders—the first at O’Donnell Field and the second on the road—would be no easy feat, the team was in a considerably better position than it was before its final two days of play in 2011.
“It was nice going into that final week and still have something to play for,” says junior third baseman Kyle Larrow.
Last year, Harvard struggled considerably. Not only did it fail to win a quarter of its games—it went 9-36 overall and 5-15 in Ivy play—but the contests in which it did come out victorious, more times than not, seemed to be the result of lucky breaks.
This season, despite winning only a handful more games than it did in the 2011 campaign, the Crimson (12-30, 8-12 Ivy) consistently put itself in good positions to come out ahead but often narrowly missed its goals.
So even though Harvard was unable to take all four matches against the Big Green—the Crimson went 1-3—the squad made strides toward overcoming its recent shortcomings.
The annual Beanpot was no different.
Led by freshman hurler Matt Timoney, who allowed seven hits and one earned run in 7.1 innings, and sophomore shortstop Jake McGuiggan, who went 4-for-5 including two RBIs and a double, the Crimson beat Boston College in the first round of the Beanpot to send it into a finals matchup with the University of Massachusetts.
In the championship game, Harvard found itself down, 8-0, heading into the bottom of the seventh. The contest looked to be a remake of last year’s Beanpot finale in which the Eagles downed the Crimson, 8-0, at Fenway Park; but this year, Harvard was not ready to throw in the towel. Recording five hits—three of them doubles—the Crimson succeeded in rallying in a major way, crossing the plate six times in the inning. Harvard scored one more run in the next frame, but it was unable to capitalize on having a man on base in the ninth, losing, 8-7.
“What the season really boiled down to were those one-run games that are swingers in baseball and could go either way,” Larrow says. “The problem was, more often than not, they didn’t go our way.”
“I thought we pitched better this year, I thought we hit better this year, [and] I thought we fielded better this year,” he adds. “We were just coming up a bit short in those close ballgames.”
Fourteen of the Crimson’s 30 losses were by only one or two runs. The majority of those losses came at the beginning of the season, when Harvard traveled to Arizona, Florida, and New York to face top-tier teams—including then-No. 7 University of Arizona and then-No. 19 Stetson. While the Crimson’s schedule was tough, it still managed to muster out its first win against the Hatters.
“The first win we had against Stetson was huge because it proved that not only could we win a game, but we could win a game against a really good team,” Larrow says. “That was great for our confidence.”
Harvard opened the season with a string of road games, including a spring break trip to Florida where the team filmed its rendition of “Call Me Maybe,” which quickly became a YouTube sensation. While the video got a number of hits, the Crimson’s opponents did as well, causing Harvard to drop 16 of 17 contests to open the season.
But Harvard managed to have more success once it returned home, going 9-11 in its final 20 contests.
“We kind of forgot how to win, if you will,” senior pitcher Brent Suter says. “Once we got the hang of it, and once we got on a little roll and got a couple games under our belt, it was better.”
The Crimson still managed to finish second in the Rolfe Division thanks to the help of a few key players.
McGuiggan had the best batting average on the team—and tied for fifth in the Ivy League—with Larrow and senior Jeff Reynolds close behind with averages of .350 and .333, respectively. Reynolds also paced the team in hits (54), doubles (13)—tied for second and seventh in the Ancient Eight, respectively—and RBIs (24), earning him a spot on the All-Ivy First Team. Meanwhile, McGuiggan found a spot on the All-Ivy Second Team, while Larrow merited honorable mention.
Suter pitched the most innings on the team and had a 4.36 ERA while averaging 7.55 strikeouts per game. Recently converted to a sidearm hurler, junior Zach Olsen turned out to be Harvard’s top reliever, recording four saves and a 2.61 ERA.
“I think we were a really resilient team,” Suter says. “The results might not have been what we wanted, but overall I’m proud of this team and how we battled and bounced back from a really bad year last year…. A couple of goals were right within reach, but we just fell short.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 2011-12 Harvard men’s basketball season ended in historic fashion. For the first time since 1946, the Crimson reached the NCAA tournament.
But Harvard’s tournament berth was not the only historic moment that occurred this past year. In its most successful season in program history, the Crimson accomplished a number of firsts: the squad won a Thanksgiving tournament, entered the top 25, downed three BCS-conference opponents, and claimed an outright conference title.
“I thought the season went well overall,” junior wing Christian Webster says. “We accomplished nearly every single one of our goals.”
The Crimson entered the 2011-12 season with high expectations. Harvard was returning its entire starting lineup—including reigning Ivy League Player of the Year Keith Wright—from a squad that shared the Ancient Eight crown and was one jumper away from the 2011 NCAA tournament.
The Crimson came out of the gates hot, opening the season with a pair of convincing wins over MIT and Holy Cross. Harvard then traveled to Los Angeles to take on a Loyola Marymount squad fresh off a double-digit victory over then-No. 17 UCLA.
After falling behind by as many as 12 in the first half, the Crimson battled back to take a four-point lead at the half. The visitor’s lead grew from there, as sophomore wing Laurent Rivard closed out the game with a team-high 20 points.
The next stop for Harvard was the Bahamas, where the Crimson participated in the Battle 4 Atlantis, a preseason tournament featuring the likes of then-No. 4 UConn and then-No. 22 Florida State.
The Crimson opened the tournament by dismantling a weak Utah squad, 75-47. The win set up a semifinal matchup with Florida State, an athletic ACC squad known for its stingy defense.
But when the teams met, it was the Crimson’s defense that prevailed. Harvard held the Seminoles to 41 points—which proved to be a season low for Florida State—and the Crimson came up with a five-point win and a berth in the championship.
In the Battle 4 Atlantis finale, Harvard met a University of Central Florida squad coming off an upset over UConn. Once again, the Crimson’s defense led the way, holding UCF to 49 points in a 59-49 win.
“That was just amazing,” Webster says. “That just helped us to realize how good we were.”
Along with its defense, crucial to Harvard’s success at the three-day tournament was the play of junior point guard Brandyn Curry. While Wright was named the tournament MVP, Curry shined in all three games, leading the charge on defense and coming up with timely baskets.
The team’s success on the defensive end continued when the Crimson returned to the United States, as Harvard bested eventual America East champion Vermont, 55-48, to improve to 7-0.
Rookie forward Jonah Travis helped extend Harvard’s winning streak to eight games by dropping 19 points and 10 rebounds in an 80-70 win over Seattle at Lavietes Pavilion.
The win propelled the Crimson into the top 25 for the first time in program history and set up a highly anticipated matchup with reigning-national champion UConn in Storrs, Conn., on ESPN2.
Harvard hung around with the Huskies—going into halftime down by two—but UConn prevailed, handing the Crimson its first loss.
It proved to be nearly a month before Harvard would pick up another, as the Crimson rebounded with double-digit wins over Boston University, Florida Atlantic, and Boston College.
Harvard closed out 2011 with a gutsy win over St. Joseph’s. After trailing by 10 at halftime, junior forward Kyle Cased brought the Crimson back with a 20-point second-half performance, and Harvard emerged with a five-point win.
“He definitely saved us that game,” Curry says. “He just completely put the team on his back. He willed us to victory. He refused to let us lose.”
But the Crimson’s good fortune ran out three days later. Visiting a struggling Fordham team, Harvard could not get a shot to fall, going 20 of 55 from the field and 8 of 30 from beyond the arc against the Rams’ zone defense.
After leading by three at the half, the Crimson ended up falling by six, 60-54.
But Harvard bounced back, winning its next nine contests.
Harvard downed Dartmouth twice to open Ivy League play, winning the games by a combined 32 points. Next up for the Crimson was a highly anticipated matchup at Yale, but the Bulldogs failed to show up, and Harvard gave Yale a 65-35 drubbing.
The Crimson moved to 6-0 in Ivy League play after downing Brown the next night and then handling Cornell and Columbia at Lavietes Pavilion the following weekend.
Off to its best start in program history, the 20-2 Crimson traveled to Penn and Princeton looking to separate itself from the competition in the Ivy League standings.
But the Tigers had other plans. After Harvard topped the Quakers by six on Friday, Princeton used a late second-half run to overcome a five-point halftime deficit. Tiger junior Ian Hummer led the way, pouring in 20 points to hand the Crimson its first conference defeat.
Harvard responded with a pair of double-digit wins over Yale and Brown at Lavietes, setting up another pair of critical matchups against Penn and Princeton. This time, the Crimson managed to down the Tigers on a Friday night, but struggled with the 8-2 Quakers that Saturday. Harvard led by eight with 11:04 to go, but that’s when Penn’s Zack Rosen stole the show. The senior scored 14 second-half points, leading the Quakers to a one-point win.
With the victory, Penn pulled even with the Crimson in the Ivy loss column heading into the final week of play.
Both teams took care of business the following weekend. Harvard downed Columbia and Cornell to secure at least a share of the Ivy League title while Penn defeated Brown and Yale. But the Quakers still had one more matchup—a visit to Princeton. Win, and Penn would force a one-game playoff with the Crimson. Lose, and Harvard would go dancing.
In a game televised on ESPN3, the Tigers came away with a victory. Princeton grabbed a 10-point halftime lead and never looked back, winning 62-52 to send the Crimson to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1946.
But that’s when Harvard’s luck ran out. Later that week, the Crimson found out it would be taking on Vanderbilt, a team fresh off a win over No. 1 Kentucky, in the second round of March Madness.
After hanging around early, the Crimson fell behind late in the first half to the Commodores and, despite a strong showing from sophomore Laurent Rivard, was never able to recover. Harvard fell, 79-70, bringing an end to the most successful season in program history.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the Harvard softball team’s biggest early season matchup, the Crimson fought Cornell in a back-and-forth contest that required extra innings to be decided. In the top of the eighth inning, the Crimson broke the tie with an RBI single, and with two outs, Big Red pitcher Lauren Marx was hoping to limit the damage and end the inning as senior Jane Alexander stepped to the plate for the next at-bat.
The last time Alexander had faced Cornell, it was the 2011 Ivy League Championship Series where she went 0-for-6 in the two-game series while batting eighth in the lineup.
But the hitter in the batter’s box on March 30 was a completely different player than the one who had batted .252 in 2011.
This time, Alexander drove a ball over the left field wall, bringing in three runs and breaking the game open as Harvard went on to cruise to a 6-2 win.
In her senior campaign, Alexander led her team in hits, batting average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, runs and extra-base hits as her breakout year helped the Crimson claim a second straight Ivy League title. For her efforts, Alexander was named Ivy League Co-Player of the Year.
“Last year my play was good enough to help the team, but it wasn’t my personal best,” Alexander says. “I got surgery after freshman year, and I kind of allowed that to affect my performance. Last year it was still affecting me a little bit mentally, and this year I made the decision to not let it do that. It’s the most frustrating thing in the world to not be able to play to your potential, but my teammates were there for me and helped me get through it.”
Instead of being affected by her wrist, Alexander has been bothering opposing pitchers from the outset of the season. Alexander began the year by recording a hit in 16 of the team’s first 18 contests. That hot start earned her the leadoff spot.
“We were trying a lot of people out to see how it felt in the lineup, and Jane kept coming on strong,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard says. “All the coaches agreed that Jane was the right girl for the job.”
“We’ve really looked to her as a senior to take over that No. 1 spot in the lineup and give us a spark, and she really has stepped up to do that,” Allard adds. “I think every position in the lineup is important, but the leadoff spot is so critical for setting a tone, and when you have a player that comes to the plate and is mentally ready to go and battles hard in the at-bats, that sends a message that we are going after you to the pitcher.”
In addition to sparking the team early, Alexander has shown a propensity to come up big late in games as well. Though she only homered three times this year, two of those dingers came in extra innings. In addition to her three-run blast against Cornell, Alexander hit a walk-off home run in the bottom of the 10th to beat Brown, 2-1.
“That’s the best part of softball, bottom of the seventh or bottom of the 10th, and the game is on the line on your bat,” Alexander says. “There is so much energy on the dugout and the field.”
For her first three years, Alexander was fairly consistent, batting .222, .228, and then .252. Then, senior year brought a remarkable jump to .408, one she credits in part to a strenuous offseason routine. Alexander spent more time working on her swing back home in California with a former coach, and continued to perfect her stroke before the season began.
“I expected myself to be better because of the work I put in,” Alexander says.
Another element of her breakout performance was the motivation that comes with playing as a senior.
“Going into your senior year, there is just a mental component that you can’t really have until your senior year,” Alexander says. “Knowing you are going into the last year of the sport you dedicated your whole life to was something that was just a great motivator.”
Co-captain Rachel Brown says that motivation was evident in practice.
“She has such great drive and motivation, so she is so inspiring for her teammates,” Brown says. “She just really plays like this is her last opportunity.”
Alexander’s energy is hard to miss in the field as she jumps around at the beginning of each inning and after each out before refocusing.
“We always knew she had this in her, and it’s really great to see her breakout like she did,” Brown says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team did not have a single player finish in the top 10 in the Ivy League in scoring during the 2011-12 season. Nor did any individual play over 30 minutes per game.
No one on the squad won the league’s Player of the Year award, nor the Rookie of the Year award, nor the Defensive Player of the Year award.
But despite no one individual turning in a standout performance, the team’s season as a whole does stand out. For during the 2011-12 campaign, the Crimson did a lot of things no Harvard men’s basketball team had ever done before.
It won an outright Ivy title for the first time in program history, setting a school record for wins with 26 in the process. It held its first ever “Crimson Madness” to mark the season’s commencement, played in (and won) its first in-season tournament, and achieved its first national ranking.
Indeed, it was a special year for the Harvard men’s basketball team, one that marked the culmination of a five-year overhaul of the program under head coach Tommy Amaker that saw it go from an 8-22 team in 2007-08 to a 26-5 one in 2011-12.
The season was capped by the Crimson’s first NCAA tournament appearance in 66 years, a nine-point loss to Vanderbilt that nonetheless marked a triumphant and long-awaited return to college basketball’s biggest stage.
“It was a great season, without a doubt,” junior guard Brandyn Curry says. “Winning an outright conference championship, winning the Bahamas tournament—there were definitely a lot of good things.”
That season began with a blowout victory over cross-river rival MIT at Lavietes Pavilion. It would not be until the season’s final home game—a 55-54 loss to Penn—that the Crimson would fall on its home court, ending what was at the time the second longest home winning streak in the country.
In between—thanks in large part to a stifling defense that allowed just 55.6 points per game, fourth best in the nation—the Crimson continued to find success.
At the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament over Thanksgiving break, Harvard unexpectedly took home the title by sweeping Utah, future ACC Champion and then-No. 22 Florida State, and Central Florida in the Bahamas.
After subsequent wins over Vermont and Seattle made Harvard 8-0, the Crimson earned a spot in the national rankings—No. 24 in the ESPN/USA Today Coaches Poll and No. 25 in the Associated Press poll—and it would remain ranked for six of the next seven weeks, peaking at No. 21.
“This is a significant achievement,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said at the time. “I’m proud of the hard work [the team] put in, and I’m very pleased and flattered that we’ve been thought of in that capacity at this point of the season.”
Harvard suffered its first loss of the year in its next contest, a 67-53 defeat at then-No. 9 UConn, but won 13 of its next 14, including key non-conference victories over Florida Atlantic, Boston College, and St. Joseph’s. It did not lose an Ivy League game until Feb. 11, when it fell by eight at Princeton, and finished the year by taking five of its final six.
The Crimson clinched at least a share of its second consecutive Ivy title with its 67-63 win over Cornell on March 3, and Penn’s loss at Princeton three days later sent Harvard dancing at long last.
“Oh my God, this is crazy, this is absolutely crazy,” co-captain Keith Wright said shortly after that goal was achieved. “You have no idea how excited I am. I’ve been running for 30 minutes, in the freezing cold, screaming at the top of my lungs.”
A week later, the Crimson threw all it had at the Commodores, who had won the SEC tournament days earlier by beating eventual national champion Kentucky. Despite staging a late-second-half rally, Harvard fell, 79-70, ending its season in Albuquerque.
But the Crimson could nonetheless take pride in having done something that hadn’t occurred at Harvard in over six decades, a destiny it achieved as a team in every sense of the word.
Now able to cross one major objective off its checklist, Harvard is already turning its attention towards taking the next step and reaching even greater heights.
“The tournament showed us we’ve come a long way, but we’ve still got a long way to go,” Curry says. “We’ve still got a lot of work we have to do if we want to get to that level and compete with those teams and advance in the tournament, which is our last goal.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In most important situations last year, whether it be on the power play or in crunch time, junior Danny Biega was in the thick of things, and his talent and leadership skills shined brightly this past season for the Harvard men’s hockey team.
Biega, recently named a first-team All-American, was a top contributor both offensively and defensively, winning the ECAC Best Defensive Defenseman award while also notching 1.06 points per game—second best nationally for defensemen.
“He’s one of those guys who plays with confidence and plays with a level of competitiveness that is galvanizing for his teammates,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 says. “Danny had a huge year for us.”
The defenseman from Montreal was an integral part of the team, manning the point on the nation’s best power play and coming up with huge plays at many critical points throughout the season while leading Harvard with a +14 rating.
“He also ate up huge minutes for us, and defensively, he was incredible,” Donato says. “He probably played more as far as ice time and important minutes for us than any player that I’ve coached at Harvard.”
Biega finished the season with 35 points—the most for a Crimson defenseman since 1993-94—which included 10 goals and 25 assists, the highest assist total for any Harvard player since 2002-03. His 14 power-play points were also the most in the ECAC.
Biega’s elite play continued in the ECAC playoffs, when he tallied five points in five games. In the Crimson’s elimination game against Yale in the ECAC quarterfinals, Biega scored two huge goals for Harvard, helping the Crimson eventually beat the Bulldogs, 4-3, in double overtime. Harvard took the third game of the series in an emphatic 8-2 win and ultimately made the conference championship, where it fell to Union, 3-1.
With his performance over the past two years, Biega became the first Harvard defenseman to record two consecutive 30-point seasons since 1986-87.
In addition to being named a first-team All-American along with teammate and assistant captain Alex Killorn, Biega was named to the ECAC First Team, was a unanimous first-team All-Ivy selection, and was the runner-up for ECAC Hockey Player of the Year
Despite his strong stats and numerous awards, Biega attributes his success to the overall improvement of the team this past season. And he will look to continue to extend this team success as the 120th captain of Harvard hockey next season, wearing the same “C” on his jersey that his older brother Alex wore in 2009-10.
“It’s a huge honor,” Biega says. “With that comes a lot of responsibility. It definitely means a lot to me, and I’m definitely taking it seriously. So next year we’re just hoping to continue on the right path and achieve more than we achieved this year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Both the Harvard heavyweight and lightweight crews have experienced success during the 2011-12 season. Heading into May’s EARC sprints, both crews boasted undefeated records. While the heavyweights finished in second, the top-ranked lightweights came out on top.
But the season is far from over for both squads, as the Crimson will compete against Yale and at the IRA National Championships in late May.
HEAVYWEIGHTS
The Harvard heavyweights began their spring season on the West Coast, competing in the two-day San Diego Crew Classic. The Crimson first varsity boat won the Copley Cup, coming out on top of a 34-boat field.
Harvard traveled to the Seekonk River to challenge Brown the following weekend. The Crimson rowers took four of its six races to retain the Stein Cup. Harvard battled difficult conditions in what proved to be a very close first varsity race.
“The most challenging race was probably against Brown,” captain Michael DiSanto says. “They row well and row extremely hard, especially down there on their home course.”
At home on the Charles River, the Crimson recorded a five-race sweep against competitors Princeton and MIT. Harvard went on to defeat Navy and Penn in four out of five races in Annapolis, Md., to capture the Adams Cup.  In its final dual race at home, the Crimson dominated once again by sweeping all five races against Northeastern.
Despite the undefeated dual season, the Harvard first varsity boat faced a disappointing result at EARC Sprints. It placed second behind Brown, although the first freshman eight secured a Sprints title, and the Crimson recorded a team win.
“Overall, we are looking forward,” DiSanto says. “We have Harvard-Yale [on May 26] and then IRAs [beginning May 31]. We had a disappointment at Sprints, so I am almost positive that the guys will work hard and respond. We’ll give it 110 percent. That is our goal going forward.”
LIGHTWEIGHTS
The Harvard lightweights kicked off their dual season with a four-race sweep of Delaware. Their success in that first race of the spring set the tone for what was to be a season of dominance and consistency.
The first-ranked Crimson posted an undefeated dual season record. The first varsity boat was also victorious all season long.
After a successful showing against Delaware, Harvard traveled to Ithaca, NY., where it took three out of five races against Cornell and Penn on the Big Red’s home course.  The Crimson went on to capture the Biglin Bowl trophy the following weekend by defeating Dartmouth and MIT at home on the Charles River.
After Harvard defeated both Navy and Georgetown, the Crimson geared up to face its two Ivy League rivals in the final dual race of the season: the Harvard-Yale-Princeton Regatta. The race held particular significance for the Harvard rowers after the first varsity boat fell to Yale by only .02 seconds at last year’s IRA National Championships.
The Crimson defeated the Bulldogs and Tigers to secure a varsity and overall team win. The Harvard first varsity boat again challenged Yale and Princeton in both the heat and grand final at EARC Sprints, and came away victorious in both races.
“That course has a turn, so there is definitely a bit of a home-court advantage,” senior Tim Moore says of the race at Yale. “It was nice to really take command of that piece. Then, to defeat Yale in the two races at Sprints was definitely a bit of payback. We respect them as very worthy opponents. We won’t be comfortable until we get them at IRAs.”
Because of the long duration of the championship season, it is almost another season unto itself. The importance of the races looms large for the Crimson rowers.
“It was obviously one goal of ours to continue that dual season record,” senior coxswain Angela Chang says. “We were looking forward to these last two championship races where we know everyone is going to be working hard.”
The IRA National Championships will take place on May 31st in Camden, N.J.
“The league is competitive enough that boats can get significantly faster,” Moore says. “We are eager to continue the streak we have had and are not done yet.”

After sitting out the 2011 spring season due to a shoulder injury, Harvard senior and heavyweight rower Sam O’Connor returned to the first varsity boat this season, and it was like he never left.
“Sam is arguably the best rower on the team,” captain Michael DiSanto says. “It’s great to get your best rower back.”
O’Connor, whose brother James is a junior on the 1V boat, described his injury to The Crimson in a feature published in mid-October preceding his return.
“I was bicycling at home over winter break, approaching an intersection,” O’Connor said. “A car ran through a red light pretty fast and hit me side-on.  I crashed into the windshield and went flying.”
O’Connor woke up in the hospital to find that his injury had affected mostly his head and shoulders.  He was treated for a dislocated shoulder in his native New Zealand and underwent shoulder surgery when he returned to Harvard in January.
Ironically, O’Connor took up cycling—the very activity that caused his injury— in order to train when he was barred from the water.  On a team as competitive as Harvard’s, a year without sport-specific training would seem to be a rower’s undoing.
But O’Connor remained positive and disciplined in his training and appears to have emerged stronger than ever. In the spring of 2010, O’Connor was part of a cohort of sophomores who completed the famed “Sprints-Henley double” in the varsity eight.
In his first race back, O’Connor continued to dominate: his boat took the Championship Eight race at the Head of the Charles Regatta.
“[Sam] makes sure that we do the best in our practices,” DiSanto says. “He has a good feel for the boat and a good feel for what’s going on around him.  It is kind of like having a coach, because he knows what’s going on.  If someone is a little off somewhere he can explain it to him in a way he’ll understand.”
O’Connor has rowed in the first varsity eight since his start at the Head of the Charles, and helped kick off the spring season with a win at the San Diego Crew Classic.
The boat defeated not only Ivy rivals but also formidable West Coast opponents. The victory landed him and the rest of the boat a cover story in Rowing News.
O’Connor also contributed to the first varsity’s undefeated dual season and second place finish at EARC Sprints.  He will be a valuable force as the heavyweights look towards the Harvard-Yale Regatta and IRA National Championships in the coming weeks.

After the Harvard men’s lightweight crew first varsity boat took the lead in the second half of the EARC Sprints championship race, the Crimson could not be caught.
From that point on, the Harvard rowers dominated the race to the finish line like they have dominated on the water all season long.
The varsity boat’s performance earned the boat a Sprints title, contributed to an overall second-place team finish, and capped off an undefeated dual season for the first ranked Harvard lightweights.
“We went out there and did our job,” senior Tim Moore says of Sunday’s race. “We executed like we had planned on.”
The Crimson’s consistency this season has been remarkable.  It has delivered results all spring, from its first dual race to the start of its championship season.
The Harvard lightweights began their dual season with a four-race sweep of Delaware.
The team never looked back from that win. It carried its success through its final dual race, the Harvard-Yale-Princeton Regatta.
The Crimson defeated both of its perennial rivals to secure both a varsity and team win.
“We definitely take one race at a time,” senior coxswain Angela Chang says. “Each one is important, but the championship season is really where we have a chance to test ourselves and perform our best.”
The victory at Sprints was the latest confirmation of the lightweights’ ability to dominate.  While they are excited by their success thus far, the upcoming IRA National Championships on June 2 are at the forefront of the rowers’ minds.
All season, Harvard has been motivated by one number: .02.  That is the fraction of a second that prevented the Crimson from victory at last year’s IRAs.
Harvard is still stinging from the close loss to Yale.
“We did the same thing last year in the varsity—took all of our dual season races and won Sprints,” Moore says. “But we came up just the slightest bit short at IRAs.  I haven’t won an IRA gold, and that is really what I want the crew to accomplish to cap off my final season of rowing.”
The Crimson will spend the coming weeks training and gearing up for its final racing opportunity. Based on the team’s success so far this season and the extra bit of motivation from last year’s results its goal of becoming national champions seems attainable.

In 2011, Josue Ortiz won the Defensive Player of the Year award, led the Ivies in sacks, and guided Harvard football to an undefeated conference season and an Ivy title.
None of those is his most memorable accomplishment of the season. Minutes after a 45-7 win over Yale in The Game marked the end of his Harvard career, Ortiz got down on one knee and proposed to sophomore Kayci Baldwin, his long-time girlfriend, in front of 50,000 fans and a national television audience.
In a year during which Ortiz was a one-man highlight reel, his proposal at the Yale Bowl, one of the lasting memories from the season, capped off a dominant campaign on the defensive line.
Ortiz led the Ancient Eight with 10 sacks—two more than Cornell’s Zack Imhoff, the runner-up in that category—despite the fact he was often double-teamed by the opposing offensive lines.
But the more telling statistic is the performance of the Crimson’s defensive line as a whole. Harvard limited its opponents to 89.7 rushing yards per game during 2011, almost 30 yards fewer than the next-best team in the league.
Throughout the season, Murphy talked about the importance of the defense—and, in particular, the defensive line—in Harvard’s success on both ends of the ball during 2011. The Crimson had its highest scoring season in the modern era, beating every league opponent it faced by no fewer than 10 points.
Ortiz and the rest of the defensive linemen played a major role in the team’s offensive prowess, allowing the offense to start its possessions in optimal field position. Harvard held its opponents to single digits four times and limited its competition to the fewest points per game in the league.
After one of Harvard’s most successful seasons in recent years, Ortiz graduated in December having earned one ring and given away another. The star lineman went undrafted in last month’s NFL draft and, despite his professional aspirations, has not signed a contract as of the time this issue went to print.
But Ortiz’s 2011 season, for his success on and off the field, remains one of Harvard’s most memorable.
“He was just important to our team, to our defense, because he was the one guy that could do some things that you just can’t coach,” Murphy says.

The Harvard men’s volleyball team may have finished the season ranked 15th in the country, but some of the squad’s standout players put up numbers that ranked even higher in the individual standings.
One of those was senior Matt Jones, who posted averages of 3.83 kills and .42 aces per set, both ninth in the nation in their respective categories.
The senior has been a fixture for the Crimson at outside hitter for the past four years, seeing significant time on the court since his freshman year in which he appeared in 74 of the team’s 75 total sets. By Jones’ junior year, he was leading the team in kills (3.95) and points per game (4.8) while serving as co-captain, a role he shared with fellow senior Dan Schreff for two years.
As a captain, Jones was an important figure on the court as well as a mentor off of it.
“I can’t say enough about Matt. I look up to him a lot, both as a friend and as a leader,” sophomore opposite hitter Nick Madden says. “He’s very good at demanding respect without asking for it. He has a presence like that.”
Madden’s sentiments were echoed by Harvard coach Brian Baise, who had nothing but praise for Jones.
“He was—at the top of any player I’ve coached—as serious about doing everything he could to make this team as competitive as it could be,” Baise says. “He never took a shortcut. He worked every practice, every lift, every match.”
The hard work paid off throughout the season, as Jones provided a spark for the Crimson offense, including on Senior Night, when Harvard faced off against EIVA-rival NJIT. Jones buried a team-high 14 kills to lead the Crimson to a 3-0 win over the Highlanders, putting his team in good position going into the season-ending conference tournament.
And although Harvard fell short of its championship aspirations in the conference semifinals, Jones’ teammates and coach still recognized the senior’s impact.
“He loves to play this game and think about this game and work at this game as much as any player I’ve ever coached…. We wouldn’t have had this season without Matt,” Baise says.
With the program on the rise, next year will prove crucial, as the Crimson will be forced to look to its strong group of underclassmen to fill the big shoes Jones has left behind.

Few Harvard athletic careers culminate with the accolades enjoyed in the past season by the men’s lacrosse team’s Jeff Cohen. The attackman from Syosset, N.Y., scored 48 goals in his senior campaign, the seventh-best single-season mark in Crimson history, en route to claiming the all-time lead in career goals for Harvard. He finishes his career with 142 goals, and this season he ranked as the nation’s second-leading scorer at just under 3.5 goals per game.
“[The record] is something I’m incredibly proud of,” Cohen says, “but you don’t accomplish something like that without a ton of people helping you along the way.”
It is difficult to overstate Cohen’s offensive prowess this season. Only four times in his team’s 14 games did he fail to record at least a hat trick. He scored five goals or more on five separate occasions, including a streak of three consecutive five- goal games early in the year against Duke, Brown, and Dartmouth. Two games later, he scored a season-best seven goals in an 11-7 win over Michigan.
Many of his goals came in big moments as well. Trailing by two goals in the fourth quarter of Harvard’s Ivy League opener against Brown, Cohen scored three straight goals to force sudden-death overtime, where he proceeded to win the game with his fifth and most thrilling goal of the night.
In the Crimson’s must-win season finale, Cohen brought Harvard even and then put the team one goal ahead with consecutive third-quarter goals.
Later in the fourth quarter, with his team trailing by two goals, Cohen cut the deficit to one. But unfortunately for Cohen and the Crimson, the equalizer was nowhere to be found.
Cohen’s big season comes as little surprise to anybody who has been following Harvard lacrosse in recent years. Cohen has led the team in scoring every year since he arrived on campus as a freshman and scored 34 goals. He followed that up with 29 and 31 goals in his sophomore and junior seasons, respectively, before exploding for 48 goals in 2012.
Cohen was named to InsideLacrosse.com’s Midseason All-America Second Team earlier this year and was recently named to the All-Ivy First Team along with teammate and tri-captain Kevin Vaughan.
The government concentrator, whose older brothers Steve and Greg also played lacrosse for Harvard, will leave open the possibility of playing professional lacrosse but in the interim plans to move to New   York to work in finance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s fall, 2003. Then-junior quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 and the Harvard football team have just closed out a somewhat disappointing, 4-3 Ivy season with a 37-19 victory over their biggest rival, Yale. And based on the atmosphere around the field, the win appears to be adequate consolation for a season of missed opportunities.
David Stearns ’07—a freshman at the time—types the first sentence of a game recap: “It’s the power of The Game.”
Nine years later, his former roommate and fellow Crimson sports editor Alex McPhillips ’07 laughs as he recalls the first line of that story.
“Simple, straight forward—that’s a very ‘Stearnsian’ lede,” McPhillips says.
*****
In December of 2011—less than five years after the Class of 2007 graduated from Harvard—the Cleveland Indians named Stearns as one of two directors of baseball operations.
Stearns is the youngest person in Major League Baseball currently occupying his post. But the former government concentrator and resident of Kirkland House noted that his youth doesn’t factor into his ability to do his job.
“At some point, [age] doesn’t matter a tremendous amount,” Stearns says. “It’s more about what you can bring to the table, if your skill set matches what is needed for the particular position.”
“I had a lot of people to teach and mentor me and help me grow,” he adds. “That’s what led to me being able to work my way up. People trusted me with more responsibility than someone my age typically has…. A lot of it is about being in the right place at the right time.”
His former roommate tends to agree.
“He’s accomplished a lot for his age,” McPhillips says. “He’s really mature and kind of an old soul. That doesn’t mean he doesn’t have a good sense of humor or like to have fun. He can hang with the best of them when we’re goofing off.”
For Stearns, his appointment to the front-office position is the next step in a lifelong baseball and sports-related journey.
“I played growing up and was always very attached to the game,” Stearns explains. “Everyone has hobbies, and everyone has activities that teach them certain things. Baseball was always that activity, and staying involved as a career and profession always intrigued me.”
Because he developed an interest in both the game and the industry at an early age, Stearns was able to start forging his path to the Indians’ front office long before he graduated from college.
“I was very fortunate in that I knew I wanted to work in baseball since high school,” Stearns says. “So right from the beginning—freshman, sophomore years in college—I sent out a lot of letters to clubs and the league office.”
After landing an internship with the Pittsburgh Pirates during his college days, Stearns bounced around the baseball world, moving to the Arizona Fall League after graduation, then to the Mets, and eventually to a three-and-a-half-year stint with the Commissioner’s office.
“One thing led to another,” Stearns says. “That’s how it seems to work. Once you get in and get a network of people, it makes it slightly easier to move around from one job to another.”
As one of two directors of baseball operations for the Indians, Stearns focuses on “contracts, strategy, and analysis.”
The Harvard graduate shares duties with Derek Falvey, who is responsible for “player personnel and acquisitions.” Falvey worked as an assistant director of baseball operations in the Indians organization immediately before the December promotion.
“[Stearns] was always a very analytical guy, very rational, a real problem solver,” McPhillips says. “He’ll approach any problem or challenge...with the same focus and sense of responsibility and really the same temperament.”
And, according to Stearns, his new position—and working in baseball in general—is about as close to a dream job as he could hope for.
“The great thing is that I’m getting to do something I genuinely enjoy doing,” Stearns says. “Being able to get up every morning and know that my job is to help make a Major League Baseball team better is very exciting.”
“The fact that there are 29 other clubs filled with really smart people trying to do the same thing and that my job is to compete with them is both challenging and exciting,” he adds. “I’m around the game and contributing to making a club better and hopefully win a lot of games.”
According to McPhillips, Stearns showed a competitive edge and leadership qualities throughout his college career.
“Dave is a very responsible, meticulous person,” McPhillips says. “He was always the responsible one in the blocking group, making sure everyone was prepared. When we went on our spring break trip to Las   Vegas, he was the one who made sure we had the tickets booked, the hotel booked. He was very responsible and a great roommate.”
And although his time in Cambridge may have been characterized by a straightforward, businesslike style, Stearns expressed sentimental attachment to his Harvard experience.
“When you leave a place like Harvard, you really gain an additional appreciation for the place,” Stearns says. “Getting to the working world and starting to realize that the talent and the intellectual spark isn’t quite the same is daunting and takes a while to adjust.”
“I definitely look back at Harvard with great memories,” he adds. “[I made] some great relationships I’ve been able to keep, and all of my best friends are still my best friends from college. I think that’s a good indicator of how special a place it is here.”
Stearns hasn’t left Harvard behind in his professional life either. Two other recent graduates—Frank Herrmann ’06 and Trey Hendricks ’04—are also involved with the Indians organization.
“It’s a pretty small club and a small industry,” Stearns says. “It’s interesting that there are three of us in the same organization, all from a four or five year span at Harvard. It’s definitely unique that we’re all involved with baseball.”
Herrmann—who went undrafted after playing four strong years of Harvard baseball—was called up to pitch for Cleveland in 2010 and then again in 2011. He is currently on the roster of the Columbus Clippers playing at the AAA level.
“It’s rare that an Ivy League player makes it to the major leagues,” Stearns says. “[Herrmann] has had tremendous success coming in undrafted.”
After being drafted by the Arizona Diamondbacks and spending five years in the minor leagues, Hendricks has shifted his career path to the administrative side of baseball as part of the Indians’ scouting team.
“Maybe what they have in common is that all three of those guys really went about their business without complaining,” McPhillips says. “They’re great, focused guys, and that’s what it takes to succeed in baseball.”
When he graduated from Harvard in 2007, Stearns was met with a difficult task: attempting to break into a popular industry with a small number of jobs available. But Stearns was able to overcome the odds and has settled in nicely to his role with the Indians—just in time for his five-year college reunion.
“I’d say that five years ago I knew I wanted to give baseball as good a shot as I could possibly give it and see how far it could take me,” Stearns says. “I knew I could be unemployed or in a career for the next 30 years of my life.... [When I graduated from college,] I knew I wanted to stay in the game and contribute as much as I could. It’s worked out so far.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Innovation’s Lab first academic year has been deemed a success by Harvard administrators and Allston residents alike.
The I-Lab—which is located next to the Business School in Allston—was created as a center for entrepreneurship, bringing together students from across the University.
Currently, the I-Lab is base camp for 55 teams-in-residence, who receive space and a host of resources, including access to “experts-in-residents” who are knowledgeable in their field of business.
University President Drew G. Faust praised the venture for encouraging the cross-pollination of ideas.
“Over the past year we have watched the I-Lab evolve from an idea into a successful innovative center that fosters collaborative creativity and entrepreneurship across the University’s Schools and throughout the Boston community,” Faust said in a statement.
Gordon S. Jones, the head of the I-Lab, said the University was surprised by the level of enthusiasm the I-Lab inspired among students.
“The biggest thing we didn’t see coming was the volume of student interest,” said Jones.
I-Lab administrators, Jones said, anticipated the Lab would receive applications from 15 teams. The Lab, instead, received proposals from 100 teams—a difference which compelled I-Lab officials to reconsider space distribution so that it could accommodate as many teams as possible.
Jones said that he considers the Lab, like the businesses it houses, to be a start-up, with all the usual highs and lows.
“It’s been a crazy but good year,” Jones said.
Allston residents were also pleased with the I-Lab’s progress in its first year.
“I think the I-Lab has been a great development for the community,” said resident and Harvard-Allston Task Force member John Cusack. “It’s a really nice spot in the neighborhood.”
Throughout the year, the I-Lab has made much of its programming available to community members, often reserving portions of workshops and lectures for local residents and small business owners.
Looking to the future, Jones said that the I-Lab will be “continuing to refine and develop.”
The I-Lab will also incorporate new features, such as a physical prototyping lab in which students can model their designs.
Faust said she is optimistic that the I-Lab will continue to grow and to serve both the Harvard and Allston community.
“In the year ahead, we expect even more engagement from aspiring and established innovators, mentors and networkers across campus and in the community who access growing I-Lab programming,” she said in a statement.

David P. Davidson, new managing director of HUDS, has taped a word cloud to his office’s glass wall, which looks out onto the rest of HUDS office.
The cloud is composed of words such as caring, good, food, communication, and service. They complete the sentence at the top of the poster: “Dining Services Customer Service Culture is....”
From planning a dinner to commemorate Harvard’s 375th anniversary to opening Plaza Taco, Harvard University Dining Services has had a busy year.
But amidst this hustle and bustle, HUDS has also made a concerted effort to improve customer service and employee satisfaction—two goals that David P. Davidson has pushed since he took over as managing director of HUDS last October.
“Customer Service is beyond just swiping with a smile,” is Davidson’s mantra, and is emblematic of his philosophy that employees should have positive relationships both with students and with one another.
“I think a lot of conversations I have with our managers is trying to get the message out that we care about our employees,” Davidson says.
COMMITTED TO SATISFACTION
Davidson worked as director of retail dining at Harvard from 1991 to 2000, before moving on to serve as executive director of dining services at Yale and director of dining services at Phillips Exeter Academy.
Missing the Boston area, Davidson returned to Harvard in 2007 as director of retail and residential operations for HUDS.
When former HUDS Managing Director Ted A. Mayer announced he would retire last year, Davidson applied for the job.
As managing director, Davidson oversees the 13 undergraduate dining halls, the Kosher kitchen, 14 cafes, Crimson Catering, marketing finance, and the Food Literacy Project.
But Davidson has still found time to work closely with the management team to “create a culture where everyone is respected and everyone is treated in a professional way,” Davidson says.
And those who work with Davidson have noticed these efforts.
“The walls have come down,” Susan G. Simon, HUDS senior human resources consultant, says of the HUDS office environment. “[Davidson is] very easy to talk to. There’s a lot of positive energy.”
In his attempts to bolster staff satisfaction, Davidson revamped HUDS’ training programs. Twenty hours a week, four hours a day during winter and spring break, HUDS staff members are required to take two classes. The University-mandated classes focus on topics such as sanitation and workplace harassment.
But under Davidson’s leadership, an optional supplementary curriculum was instituted. These development courses included a pizza-making class, a coffee tasting session, and customer service culture classes.
“The whole idea is to give [our employees] experience,” Davidson says. “Give people an opportunity for them to know what they’re doing and give them skills they can use somewhere else.”
Robert J. Leandro, director of operations and facilities, says that Davidson “is concerned about the employees. He wants them to be happy.”
For Davidson, HUDS plays an integral part in Harvard’s House system because every House has a dining hall.
“The dining hall becomes a very crucial part of the community and building the community of the House. It’s going to be your home for the next three years,” Davidson says. “Clearly, our main role is to make sure that you all are having a great experience and we’re meeting your needs.”
To increase student’s satisfaction with HUDS, Davidson has implemented  changes that make dining more accessible to busy students, such as the addition of ready-made salads.
Overall, Davidson’s commitment to employee and student satisfaction has benefited him in his first year as HUDS managing director.
“We’re really pleased. It’s been a good transition,” Simon says. “It’s an ongoing process that David is really committed to.”

Members of the Occupy Harvard movement plan to demonstrate at Commencement on Thursday in protest of the potential layoffs of Harvard University Library staff, according to a press release distributed by the movement.
Occupiers plan to gather outside the Holyoke Center before making their way into the Yard, where Commencement takes place.
The protest, which is slated to include undergraduates, graduate students, and members of the Harvard Union for Clerical and Technical Workers, comes after 65 library workers took a voluntary early retirement package following an announcement by library leadership in January that the library restructuring may include layoffs.
Although the University has not said for certain that it will lay off workers, Occupy Harvard is protesting because “administrators have never lifted their threats to cut even more jobs,” according to the press release.
Jennifer A. Sheehy-Skeffington, a graduate student in psychology and an occupier, said that the No-Layoffs-Campaign is important because a smaller staff would damage what Occupiers view as an already strained library system.
“This is important because the library workers have been threatened at a time when the library is already really suffering,” Sheehy-Skeffington said.
On the Occupy Harvard blog, Occupy leaders wrote that they organized the protest in order to bring the issue to the attention of people from across the Harvard community, including alumni and parents, “to expose the damage that has been done to the libraries already, and how much more harm further cuts would inflict.”
Skeffington added that the protest is not just about the library-specific cuts, but also about the University’s approach toward labor.
“This kind of cost-cutting, corporate approach is very disappointing,” she said.
Skeffington said that she hopes students will appreciate how cuts and restructuring could endanger the entire library system, one of the “most valuable aspects of the college.” She said that the proposed plan would mean that students would be deprived of the chance to work closely with library specialists, while more skilled library workers would be working in centralized jobs that would not take advantage of their expertise.

The Class of 2012 will unite Wednesday afternoon in Tercentenary Theater to celebrate the annual Senior Class Day Exercises, which will include addresses from Mass. Congressman Barney Frank ‘61-’62 and Saturday Night Live cast member Andy Samberg.
The event will also include remarks by Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds and the Ivy and Harvard orations, which are delivered by members of the class of 2012.
Frank, the guest alumni speaker for Class Day, has served for 30 years as a Representative of the Fourth District of Massachusetts. In 2010, he co-wrote the  plan for U.S. financial reform as head of the House Committee on Financial Services.
Samberg just completed his seventh season as a cast member of Saturday Night Live and has been in films such as “Friends With Benefits,” “I Love You Man,” and “Hot Rod.” In 2007, Samberg won a Creative Arts Emmy for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics.
“The contrast between [Frank and Samberg] will make for a memorable afternoon,” said Matt J. DaSilva ’12, Senior Class Committee Class Day Chair.
Four student speakers will join Samberg and Frank.
The two Harvard Orators, Steven N. Maheshwary ’12 and Pauline Mutumwinka ’12, will deliver reflective speeches.
“The speech I wrote is intensely personal because it focuses on our collective vulnerabilities and fears, so I’m going to try not to choke up tomorrow,” Maheshwary wrote in an email. “I’d say being nervous/excited to share my message is a bit of an understatement.”
While the Harvard Orations are focused on more poignant messages, the Ivy Orations provide lighthearted comic relief. This year, the Ivy Orations will be delivered by Jacqueline J. Rossi ’12 and Matthew E. Whitaker ’12.
“It’s pretty nervewracking... There’s a lot of pressure to be funny,” Whitaker said. “I’m planning on looking at the trees a lot.”
Although Whitaker admitted to being nervous, Rossi said she is prepared for the challenge.
“I’m not that nervous,” Rossi said. “I’ve been practicing for four years, making a fool of myself at school.”
Whitaker, laughing, commented on his friendship and shared sense of humor with Rossi. “I’m surprised that the drivel we share would be funny to anyone else,” he said.

The Harvard Square Business Association has drafted a plan that proposes replacing Harvard Square’s iconic Out of Town News kiosk with an interactive information center and adding stadium seating and an approximately 23-foot-wide LED screen to the Pit.
The preliminary plan provided to The Crimson, designed by Ann Krsul Architecture and funded by the HSBA, was drafted by a committee of stakeholders including representatives of the Coop, Cambridge Savings Bank, Harvard University, and other businesses in the HSBA, according to John P. DiGiovanni, the president of the HSBA.
The planning committee has met recently with many elected and unelected Cambridge officials to discuss and review the plans.
Mayor Henrietta J. Davis said the plans will be vetted by community members and city leaders before moving forward, and City Manager Robert W. Healy cautioned that funding for the renovation has not been solicited or allocated yet.
“There are some things I liked about it, some things I didn’t like,” Davis said. “It’s very good that the businesses got out there and did some work. Sometimes you have to propose an option before people really decide to do something.”
21ST-CENTURY IMPROVEMENT
The discussion of the plans follows the completion of the third phase of an ongoing city improvement project that has brought repaved streets and new sidewalks to several parts of Harvard Square since it began in 2006.
Sheldon Cohen Island, the central gateway to Harvard Square that is home to the Pit and the Out of Town News kiosk, has been left untouched since the MBTA rerouted the Red Line 20 years ago. Now it will see construction next year when the MBTA renovates the elevator located there to meet court-mandated accessibility standards.
“As the rest of the area around the plaza really began to be upgraded and look nice, the plaza really became clear it needed some more attention,” DiGiovanni said.
DiGiovanni, who leases properties on Church Street, in the Garage retail complex on JFK Street, and in other parts of the Square, has been a leader in the beautification projects in the Square since the publication in 1998 of a document published by the HSBA called “Polishing the Trophy,” which suggested improvements to the streets, sidewalks, and lighting in Cambridge’s preeminent tourism hub.
He likened today’s 15-page document outlining the new vision for Sheldon Cohen Island to the landmark publication of 14 years ago, which eventually led to major construction projects.
“Just as ‘Polishing the Trophy’ started, we thought, ‘Let’s do something that can begin the discussion,’” DiGiovanni said. “Some images and renderings can help stimulate some creativity and hopefully some collaboration.”
The new plan would model the busy heart of Harvard Square on the look and feel of New York City’s Times Square, DiGiovanni said.
The document says, “The primary goal of this plan is to continue to use this world-recognized and beloved urban space as a meeting place while enhancing its communal features and uses.”
Artistic renderings in the proposal depict a new “Red Line Theater”: stadium seating looking down on the Pit and the double-sided LED screen standing behind the seating overlooking the entrance to the T station.
The five-foot-tall screen would project news, show videos of past and present activity in the Square, and broadcast special events like Harvard’s Commencement, DiGiovanni said. Other additions include tables and chairs, greenery, and bicycle racks.
City Manager Robert W. Healy said that it might be time for a refresher for the area but expressed hesitation about the ambitious plan’s cost.
“That’s a focal point of Harvard Square that needs some sprucing up,” he said. “I think it’s a nice project. My worry is, how do we finance it?”
Funds have not been allocated for refurbishing Sheldon Cohen Island in the current five-year capital planning, but Healy said he was interested in fine-tuning the design and exploring public-private partnerships to enable it.
TRANSFORMING THE PIT
Sheldon Cohen, a legendary presence who has been called the unofficial mayor of Harvard Square, sold the newsstand on the brick island that now bears his name to Hudson News in 1994 after 39 years manning the kiosk.
Hudson News decided not to renew its lease in 2008, but the stand found a new owner, Muckey’s Corp. When that company’s lease ends in 2013, the city could tear down the kiosk to make room for the new interactive glass-walled building depicted in the plan.
“The kiosk is really an icon of the Square. It’s a natural meeting place, and we all feel that there should be something that reflects that,” said Jeremiah P. Murphy ’73, president of the Coop and vice president of the HSBA.
The stand has long struggled to survive despite the decline of print media sales. Murphy said that converting the kiosk to an interactive information area with a wraparound news ticker would better serve the modern-day public.
As the main entrance to the MBTA station, Sheldon Cohen Island serves as a crossroads for tourists, students, and residents alike.
“It can create a cloud of social interactions,” said Laura E. Donohue ’85, the owner of Bob Slate Stationer on Brattle Street.
DiGiovanni said that he expects Harvard will be a partner in funding and envisioning any renovations, as it has been in the last 15 years of planning and construction spurred by “Polishing the Trophy.”
“Harvard is one of many stakeholders working together to maintain and enhance the unique character of Harvard Square,” Christine M. Heenan, Harvard’s vice president for public affairs and communications, wrote in an email. “Harvard looks forward to a being part of a very healthy partnership with city government, local residents, and the Harvard Square Business Association that care about Harvard Square.”

Celebrity chef and nutritious-food aficionado Jamie Oliver received the 2012 Healthy Cup Award on Wednesday.
Presented by the Harvard School of Public Health, this award recognizes an individual “who has made a tremendous contribution to public health and improving nutrition throughout the world,” said Julio Frenk, dean of HSPH.
About 500 people attended the sold-out event, which took place at the Joseph B. Martin Conference Center at Harvard Medical School.
Oliver, the host of the Emmy Award-winning show, “Jamie Oliver’s Food Revolution,” was honored for his advocacy for healthy eating and cooking, as well as for his fight against childhood obesity.
At the award ceremony, Oliver lifted the silver Healthy Cup over his head as he thanked the audience for supporting his mission to improve global public health.
“To have this [award] means a lot,” he said.
Oliver is known for a campaign he began in 2004 to improve school lunch programs in the U.S. and the U.K., according to Walter C. Willett, chair of the department of nutrition at HSPH.
While on stage, Oliver asked the packed audience to imagine what a society more focused on healthy eating habits would look like.
“Imagine a world where mothers would not feed bottles of Coca-Cola to babies,” he said, “where the ingredients would not read like scientific equations, where children and parents gardened veggies together.”
In order to raise public awareness of healthy eating, Oliver created Food Revolution Day, an event dedicated to bringing people together to “share information...and to pass on their knowledge and highlight the world’s food issues,” according to the event’s website.
“What’s beautiful about it is that people really loved the excuse to stand up for real food,” he said. “My wish is that in the next three years, a real, real food revolution will happen.”
Oliver also encouraged people to be proactive about their eating habits, adding that he believes that smartphone applications that provide healthy recipes and educate individuals about nutrition can play an important role in the future of this movement.
Oliver, who said that he believes that “modern day health is basic human rights,” added that he focuses his activism on empowerment and education.
“My uncompromised belief is that, whether we are British, American, or any dude on the planet, we can make great decisions if we are informed properly,” he said. “That gives me hope.”
The biannual Healthy Cup Award was created six years ago by HSPH’s Nutrition Round Table, a group of leaders from the business and food worlds that support research in nutrition and school meals.
Past award recipients have included U.S. Senator Tom Harkin in 2010 for putting wellness and health awareness on the American agenda, Kenneth H. Cooper in 2008 for his role as the “father of aerobics,” and businessman Lee Iacocca in 2006 for his efforts to find a cure for diabetes.

In her final season for the Crimson, Rachel Brown went out with a bang.
The right-handed hurler capped off an already stellar career with another standout performance in her fourth and final year on the Harvard softball team.
Brown lived up to her title as the 2011 Ivy League Pitcher of the Year, earning the distinction again in 2012 and finishing with a 19-5 record in the regular season.
The strikeout queen was also selected as the Ivy League Pitcher of the Week for five of the nine weeks in which the award was given.
In the NCAA rankings, Brown placed second in hits allowed per seven innings, with 3.78. The ace is ranked fifth in the nation in strikeouts per seven innings, fanning 9.7 batters on average.
“This year was the best I’ve seen her mentally,“ Harvard coach Jenny Allard says. “A lot of teams were gunning for her; they felt like it was their year to try to get to her, but I think she handled that pressure well. She was really a great leader in the circle.”
In the Ivy League Championship Series, Brown blanked the Penn offense in Game 1 and completed a perfect two-inning save in Game 2, helping the Crimson to its second consecutive conference title. Brown allowed just four hits in those nine innings pitched.
“Rachel single-handedly keeps us in so many games because she can limit the opponent’s offense to such a degree,“ Allard says. “When we know Rachel can shut a team out, our offense has a real chance to win the game. That has been a huge factor in our success.”
This year, Brown led the Ancient Eight in opposing average (.152), earned run average (1.34), and strikeouts (232).
The .152 opposing batting average and 1.34 ERA are both career bests for the righty, and the former sets a new all-time record for the Harvard softball program.
Coming into this season, Brown already held the school record in ten of the 27 all-time pitching categories. With the addition of this year’s numbers, the star hurler will break into the top spot for several other career categories, including shutouts (24), innings pitched (660.6), games started (92), and wins (72).
“I feel comfortable saying that Rachel Brown is the most talented pitcher Harvard softball has had in terms of four years of cumulative success,” Allard says. “I’ve had a lot of pitchers who have been dominant in the conference but to go beyond the conference and win is a pretty elite.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Many college athletes dream of someday taking their skills to the pros. Rarely does it happen the other way around.
But for freshman Amanda Sobhy, who is currently ranked No. 29 in the Women’s International Squash Player’s Association, the college game has always been in the plan.
“I’ve been playing as an individual for most of my life,” Sobhy says. “Being a part of a college team was one of the main reasons I decided to play in college rather than just play professionally…. It’s like a family.”
Sobhy—the 2010 Junior World Champion and the youngest woman to win four WISPA titles—is the most highly-touted player in college squash history. In her perfect 15-0 rookie campaign, the freshman never dropped a set on her way to both an individual and team title in her first year with the Crimson.
Not only was her record pristine, but it came against the country’s best competition. In the Howe Cup final against Yale, Sobhy dropped the defending individual national champion Millie Tomlinson, 11-1, 11-3, 11-1.
With dominance comes pressure to always succeed, but Harvard coach Mike Way believes his rookie sensation got the job done when she when she was called upon.
“Her opponents in those matches are very relaxed and they are free to play,” Way says. “[Sobhy] is not free to play because of expectation. But I think she’s maturing and growing as a player and not just in college squash.”
In addition to giving her two college national titles, 2012 has so far proved successful for the Sea Cliff, N.Y., native individually. Entering as an amateur, Sobhy has continued to play in the pro circuit, most notably advancing to the quarterfinals of the Cleveland Classic by downing the No. 2 and No. 6-ranked women in the world.
For Sobhy, the tournament proved that she could succeed at both the college and professional level simultaneously.
“[The Cleveland Classic] was the first time I beat a top-five player,” Sobhy says. “I was happy with how I played, especially because so many people overseas and so many professionals said, ‘Oh, you can’t improve in college.’ It’s nice to prove these people wrong and to show them that you can go to a top university and still do well on the professional circuit as well.”
Though her on-court achievements propelled the team to new heights, Sobhy’s greatest contributions came from her presence off the court, according to co-captain Cece Cortes.
“Without her, we definitely would not be the positive, winning team that we were this year,” Cortes says. “We don’t have the team chemistry we had this year without her.”
Cortes remembers Sobhy making her impact early. While her participation in professional tournaments was reviewed, Sobhy was withheld from the first 30 percent of Harvard’s season.
“When she was not able to play in October and November, she came to all of our important matches,” Cortes says. “She was there with her foam finger and helping everyone out, being a teammate and a source of support.”
When Sobhy’s debut did finally come against Penn, she dropped Quaker captain and unanimous All-Ivy Selection Nabilla Ariffin, 11-5, 11-1, 11-0.
Similar results followed, as Sobhy and 2010 Individual National Champion Laura Gemmell became one of the most formidable pairs in collegiate squash history at the top of the Crimson lineup.
Sobhy was the highlight of an impressive freshman class for the Crimson, with four members of the Class of 2015 playing the top nine. No freshman posted below an .833 winning percentage on the season.
While Sobhy’s dominance quickly became the main headline of the season, the freshman believes that the pressures in college squash are much different from those in the professional tournaments.
“There’s a little more pressure [in college] of having to not only win for yourself, but for your teammates and your school and your coaches,” Sobhy says.
Sobhy is also enjoying playing under Way—a top coach with a wealth of experience both in the pros and in college.
“He’s coached at the top professional level and coached some of the guys to world No. 1,” Sobhy says. “He has so much knowledge and it’s great to work under someone who has that experience and knowledge of training top athletes.”
Way is also enjoying the chance to work with one of the world’s youngest and brightest.
“She’s the hardest working player of both teams,” Way says. “When you’ve got someone leading by such an example—and with such a drive and desire to reach her full potential—it’s tough for others not to follow down that path.”

When Rebecca Nadler took sixth place in the giant slalom in the first weekend of the 2012 Eastern Intercollegiate Ski Association Carnival season, Harvard alpine coach Tim Mitchell said it was as impressive a finish as he’d seen her post, making it, by extension, as strong a result as a Crimson alpine skier had registered at an EISA carnival.
It turned out that the sophomore was just getting started.
Over the course of the 2012 season, Nadler kept achieving larger milestones for the Harvard alpine skiing team, giving it its first podium finishes with back-to-back second-place performances in giant slalom events and, at the Williams Carnival, a first-place finish.
It marked the first time a Crimson alpine skier had won a Carnival and the first time since 2004 that any skier from Harvard had done so. The win, combined with a third-place finish in the slalom event, put her in the lead for total points among EISA skiers.
“When I saw the results, it took a while for it all to sink in,” Nadler says. “I had some friends around and they came up to me after the race and said, ‘Becca, you won.’ I said, ‘No I didn’t….’ It was an incredible feeling the support, especially with my parents here, and my coaches and friends. It was absolutely incredible.”
Nadler ultimately finished second in EISA points behind the University of Vermont’s Kate Riley.
But the setback soon became water under the bridge at the NCAA Championships, where Nadler won the giant slalom event, giving the Crimson its first national title in the sport. The sophomore followed it up with a seventh-place finish in the slalom for another All-America honor.
“I think my individual season was pretty incredible,” Nadler says. “To say I’m happy about how things went is a huge understatement.”
Adding to the significance of the event was the fact that Nadler, who grew up on the slopes of the East, was able to win the title while racing on the vastly different snow of the West.
“Heading out for Montana, I wasn’t totally sure what to expect, or where I would measure up to girls in the West,” Nadler says. “I tried to just focus on what I’ve been doing all year, go in, and have fun.”
Not only was her season historic by Harvard’s standards, Nadler also made substantial strides in her own performance. Nadler kicked off her rookie campaign with a fourth-place finish in the giant slalom, but much of her season was plagued by injuries and illness. While Nadler ended the year with a 20th-place finish in the slalom, she took second-to-last in her preferred event, the giant slalom.
This year, by contrast, Nadler gained steam over the course of the season, posting better and better finishes and making the biggest statement of her career on the NCAA’s biggest stage.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This Saturday, Chen Guangcheng arrived in New York City, finally escaping the ordeal of persecution he suffered in his native China. The blind activist, recognized worldwide for his legal efforts on behalf of the disenfranchised, and most notably for his struggles against forced abortions and sterilizations in Shandong Province, has come a long way since he dramatically escaped house arrest in April. It appears that the Chinese government allowed Mr. Chen to leave the country on the condition that he not do so as an asylum seeker—instead, he has been given a law fellowship to study at New York University.
This last detail might be considered but a minor one in Mr. Chen’s unlikely saga, yet it hints at the important role held by American universities in fostering democracy and good governance abroad. In this particular case, Mr. Chen’s affiliation with NYU is a way for the Chinese government to save face. In the eyes of Beijing, amnesty for Mr. Chen would only legitimize his suffering and his cause. While the communist regime maintains a tight control on the media at home—one state-run tabloid condescendingly claimed that “dissidents…fail to make a dent among the Chinese”—it is highly sensitive to criticism from the international community. Yet it seems likely that Mr. Chen will benefit from his time at NYU, and, if he one day returns home, he will arrive better-equipped to battle the injustices he may there encounter.
On another level, American universities have a unique opportunity to encourage democracy abroad. Nearly 700,000 foreign students currently pursue higher education in the United States. Many of them will return home and, one day, serve as leaders in their national communities. During their time in America, these students are exposed to a vibrant environment of open discourse they might not find in their own countries. By becoming part, if only temporarily, of a society that prizes freedom of speech and civil liberties, foreign students may come to better appreciate that such values are crucial to national wellbeing.
Harvard, due in part to its unparalleled resources and international prestige, has long served as a center for molding world leaders. In fact, the University frequently welcomes to its fold the children of current global figures. The recent controversy surrounding Bo Guagua—a student at the Harvard Kennedy School whose father, former regional Chinese Communist Party leader Bo Xilai, suffered a well-documented political downfall—serves as an uncomfortable reminder of this.  For better or worse, a comparatively large number of foreign students at Harvard are uniquely poised to hold positions of influence in the future. Still other international students, armed with the prestige that a Harvard education confers, may very well be powerful figures one day. We hope that their time here allows them to grow as persons, so that they may one day better serve their countries.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Spanish, French, German, Latin, and Chinese. Such were the language options available at my suburban public high school in Central Pennsylvania. Although the school district did not require its students to study a foreign language, it was highly encouraged, especially for those interested in pursuing higher education. We were lucky enough to sample each option during our final year of middle school, so we understood what we would be getting into. My freshman year of high school coincided with the Chinese program’s inauguration. Many students heeded the oft-heard advice to take “the language of the future,” and, as a result, Chinese I was packed. It especially attracted the high achieving students who would graduate at the top of the class.
Chinese I provided my classmates and me with a literal cultural shock, as we found ourselves in an unfamiliar situation—a class, an incredible one, taught by a woman with seemingly minimal English skills. While eighth grade concentrated on culture and was rather lax on correct pronunciation of tones, ninth grade was a struggle. For that matter, so were tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grades. It took us four years to learn the material imparted to Harvard students in one. Many students did not make it, usually opting to divert their studies to Spanish in their sophomore or junior year. Those who did complete the challenge, however, were rewarded with a sense of achievement unavailable in other classes. In our senior year, we had an opportunity to put our hard-earned skills to use with a trip to the Middle Kingdom.
Few of us actually expected to have to employ our Chinese abroad. After all, we were imbued with the prideful presumption that everyone in the world speaks our language as well as the simmering timidity at our true linguistic ability. Both assumptions were immediately defeated. Rather than everyone speaking English, we soon discovered that, on the contrary, no one spoke English. On the plane I talked to a man who said he worked in finance. I tried to spark a conversation in English but quickly realized that was impossible. At a hotel in Beijing—one that seemed to have its fair share of Western guests and served both Continental and Chinese breakfasts—the maître d’hôtel was flummoxed by my friend’s request for “coffee,” until we conveyed our desire for two cups of “kafei.”  Later in the trip, we visited a Chinese high school, where crowds of basketball-playing students greeted us, eager to test out their English. However, their English was broken, and extended conversations were carried out either in a loose pidgin or facilitated by our teacher’s translation.
This was when I remembered my teacher boasting proudly about being the best English student in her class. Yet her speech was practically indiscernible my freshman year. After seeing a Chinese school firsthand, I realized the inherent deficiencies of English language programs in China. It is impossible to find good English speaking teachers for 1.3 billion people. My Chinese teacher confirmed my suspicions. Older Chinese are hubristic enough to look at their recent success and conclude, not unlike us, that they have no need to learn English and that the rest of the world would be sensible to brush up on their characters. Younger Chinese are excited to increase their life prospects with the language but lack quality educators to teach it to them. As a result, the world’s most populous country suffers from the competitive disadvantage of not being able to speak the lingua franca of globalization.
Americans can approach this situation in two ways. We can take pride in our exceptionality and believe others should learn our tongue. Alternatively, we can recognize the great opportunity to increase our national skillset and be able to communicate with people in the world’s second largest economy. The second option has very little downside—after all, it simply redirects time studying Chinese that would otherwise be spent learning European languages. Europeans have much more exposure to English, a language intrinsically closer to their own, and have a wide array of mother tongues, such that it would take much longer to be able to speak to each of the half billion people in the EU. Likewise, the linguistic choices of the half billion in Latin America are divided between Spanish and Portuguese.
Chinese speaking ability grants access to communication with over a billion people in the world. This opens quite a few doors in a world in which 64 percent of business executives are at least bilingual and 39 percent of employers hire specifically bilingual candidates. Since businesses generally want customers, as well as manufacturing partners, it stands to reason that knowledge of the language most spoken by a plurality of these groups is critically important and beneficial when job-seeking. Thus, it is within homo economicus’s rational self-interest to equip himself with this skill.
It may be more efficient for every Chinese speaker to suffer arguably less growing pains to learn English (although, as a native speaker, I cannot say if English is truly easier to comprehend—we have many convoluted structural practices unfound in the rigidly simplistic patterns of Chinese grammar). However, it is not America’s place to dictate efficiency to the people of the world. Rather, we can take this opportunity to benefit from the Tower of Babel inefficiency of multiple world languages. Until everyone starts speaking Esperanto, let us take advantage of China’s mulishness in learning English and put ourselves a step ahead.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I found out my freshman rooming assignment while on vacation with my family. I remember my grandmother reading the states out loud to me, over the phone, mangling the girls’ names with her Russian accent. With each state, my heart dropped lower into my stomach: Texas, Tennessee, North Carolina, and the Midwestern unknown of Michigan and Missouri. Moving into my three-bedroom, six-person Hurlbut suite three years ago, I was terrified.
Maybe that’s why it’s hard for me to feel anger at Dharun Ravi. On Monday, he was sentenced to 30 days in prison, a hefty fine, and 300 hours of community service for his role in the suicide of his roommate, Tyler Clementi. Of course, Ravi’s punishment isn’t actually for Clementi’s suicide—instead, it was for violation of privacy, bias, and some other minor charges. But both sides knew that the charges were only a cover for the death he couldn’t be charged for. And so, many are condemning the sentence he received as too light.
To be honest, I didn’t follow the case in the beginning. A combination of dismissal of the much-delayed realization and panic over the suicides of gay kids—an epidemic that had been going on for years without notice—and the seeming difference between this case and those of middle-school students bullied while administrators and parents turn their heads made me turn away.
It wasn’t until spring break, when the verdict was announced, that I tuned in. I read the New Yorker’s profile of the two roommates from a hostel’s computer, and I felt an instant pang of sympathy. Like Dharun, I had looked up my roommates’ Facebook profiles, occasionally cringing at what I found. Like Dharun, I instant-messaged friends, lamenting my predicament. Like Dharun, I was in possession of technology that enabled me to form opinions of my suitemates before even meeting them based on their self-representations on the web.
But what struck me most about The New Yorker’s profile was the other Tyler that Dharun had initially mistaken for Clementi. Tyler Picone, another incoming freshman, was openly gay and hyper-flamboyant. He didn’t match the shy, nerdy, introverted profile that Dharun had constructed for Clementi. When Ian Parker, the writer for The New Yorker, spoke with Picone for the piece, Picone laughed off the IM exchanges joking about his sexuality and suggested that had he been assigned to room with Dharun, they might’ve become friends. For the last two months, I haven’t been able to get that thought out of my head.
The summer before my freshman year, I zoomed in on the Bible quotes lining the “About Me” sections of my roommates from Texas and Tennessee. Up to that point, religiosity to that degree was for me embodied in the Chabad Jews I lied to about my Judaism when they asked me in the subway and hijab-clad friends from my Brooklyn high school. I was terrified, uncomfortable, and insecure, when encountered with this new form of religiosity that I perceived as personified in Jerry L. Falwell, probably more than Dharun was upon discovering Clementi. I couldn’t believe that my roommates might not believe in evolution.
Three years later, I have changed from the insecure freshman that I was when assigned to live with them. After cursing Harvard’s rooming assignments, I now count among my friends people with similar political and religious views to the girls I lived with. And so, reading about the case, I can’t help but think, “what if?”
What if Dharun hadn’t broadcast a live feed of his dorm room over Twitter? What if the Clementi’s male visitors hadn’t started to come over until later in the semester, or the following term? What if Dharun had a little time to settle down and feel more secure in himself before this happened, so that he didn’t feel need to need to pick apart his roommate in conversations with friends?
I don’t know if 30 days is a fitting sentence for Dharun, or if the “what if?” element should affect our perception of what happened in their Rutgers dorm room. But I know I’m glad he wasn’t sentenced to ten years. Re-reading the profile and remembering myself three years ago, I know that college has been a time of incredible growth for connecting with and accepting people who are in many ways different. Likewise, it has been a time of growth and a time to become more secure in my own beliefs and myself. And I like to think that, had that fateful day on the George Washington Bridge not happened, Dharun and Clementi might have become friendly. I like to think that, if they had lived together for a year, they would’ve both experienced the personal growth that college is meant to foster.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yesterday marked the long-awaited liftoff of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Media outlets paraded the advent of commercial spaceflight, surely an exciting event, but yesterday’s historic launch also may come to represent the day the commodification of outer space started to eclipse the grander mission the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has traditionally held of exploring space for the benefit of humanity. Such a possibility is saddening, as the value of space exploration beyond tours to the outer reaches of our atmosphere is indeed vast, and mankind is the worse off for ignoring it.
Last fall, NASA reported that its spacecraft Cassini had completed its mission flying around Saturn’s moon Enceladus and taking photos. The moon was a point of curiosity due to its mysterious jets of salty water vapor and ice. The ocean-like salty water had tremendous implications, as Nicolas Altibelli, the European Space Agency’s lead scientist for Cassini, explained that this showed that life- supporting conditions on ice moons and planets were possible. Reports like these often take us far beyond the everyday realms of Earth. We are forced to ask questions of philosophy and existence: Where did life come from? Where could it be going? Are we alone?
However, these research missions and the questions that follow them often do not produce profits, while representing enormous risk. The privatization of space travel has made extraterrestrial tours likely, but companies like SpaceX will try to minimize costs while maximizing revenue. With the excitement surrounding commercial spaceflight, the exploration of space for the purpose of finding out more about our universe may become a secondary concern, both politically and culturally.
In 2010, President Obama announced that he would be canceling the Constellation spaceflight program—the replacement for NASA’s storied space shuttles—along with plans for manned spaceflight to the moon. Under this new initiative, the first possibility of manned spaceflight to an extraterrestrial body would be an orbit around Mars sometime in the 2030s. Though the use of commercial vehicles is not an entirely negative development, as NASA’s bureaucracy often needlessly increases costs, the significant reduction of NASA’s influence caused by the cancellation of the Constellation program and the lunar missions is. President Obama needs to increase NASA’s budget as well as state a more definite goal to reach either the Moon again or Mars in less than twenty years.
Due to Congressional budget cuts, NASA’s budget is steadily declining, to the detriment of everyone living on our planet. An increase in NASA’s budget, no matter how ambitious, would be pennies relative to other significant governmental spending. NASA’s budget for 2011 was a bit under $20 billion, but put that number in context: the United States spent over $20 billion for air-conditioning in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2011. While the return on investment of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan has been at best questionable, the engineering ingenuity required to send vehicles and humans to space is so vast that NASA’s research has spawned countless masterpieces of engineering that are now commonplace. Though NASA should not function as a government-sponsored research and development center for useful inventions, the positive externalities of NASA’s research have been so monumental that they are hard to ignore.
Clearly, something can be done to increase NASA’s yearly budget, but public support (or lack thereof) is the problem. NASA’s yearly budget has been decreasing as a proportion of the federal budget every year since 1965, but people do not realize, or care. In a paper published in Space Policy, Roger Launius, the curator of planetary exploration programs at the Smithsonian Institute, found that in 1997 the “average estimate of NASA’s share of the federal budget by those polled was 20 percent. If this were true, NASA’s budget in 1997 would have been $328 billion.” The vast ignorance that surrounds NASA’s budget is a significant reason it has been shrinking.
President Obama needs to specify a mission to either the Moon or Mars and set a firm deadline à la John F. Kennedy ’40. This would create a target for NASA to work towards and a tangible goal that the American public can easily understand. The money that would be needed to expand NASA to allow manned flights to the Moon and Mars is there, but public support to open the Congressional purse is not. Increased educational outreach efforts would help Americans understand how important NASA continues to be, and if persuasive enough, might let them be more generous with their money. Most of all, we need to dream again. After all, $30 or $40 billion a year for an institution that transports human beings beyond the confines of our rock is anything but expensive.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nathan G. Bihlmaier, a Harvard Business School student known by his friends for his strong principles, family values, and thoughtful approach to life, was found dead on Tuesday.
Bihlmaier, who was set to graduate on Thursday, went missing Saturday night after being asked to leave a pub in Portland, Maine. Police discovered his body Tuesday in Portland Harbor after conducting a search near the pier where he had last been seen. There was no evidence of foul play, according to Portland Police Department Lieutenant Gary Rogers.
“He was a great guy,” said Helen Y. Weng ’08, a classmate of Bihlmaier’s at the Business School.
Bihlmaier was passionate about technology and health care, friends said. After graduating from the University of Kansas in 2003, Bihlmaier worked for the Cerner Corporation in Kansas City, Chicago, Denver, and Boston. He later worked as a summer associate for the United States Department of Health and Human Services.
“This is a very sad day for all of us,” the Business School said in a statement. “There is a tremendous sense of community here, of camaraderie among students, faculty, and staff. We are all in a state of shock and grief, and our hearts and prayers go out to Nate’s family at this terrible time. This is a tragic loss, and we are very sad.”
Beyond his interests in health care, Bihlmaier was an avid skier.
“Skiing was his passion,” said classmate Jad S. Elias.
Andrew J. Rosenthal, Bihlmaier’s close friend and fellow Business School student, often went on ski vacations with Bihlmaier. He recalled their last trip together, in February at Breckenridge Ski Resort in Colo. On the trip, Bihlmaier managed to convince Rosenthal to join him in hiking further up the mountain and skiing down a particularly “steep and very narrow run” known as a chute.
“Nate came down it and skied beautifully,” Rosenthal said. “I did not do as well,” he added, laughing.
Bihlmaier was also known for his deep devotion to his family, especially his wife, Nancy Ho Bihlmaier, who is pregnant with the couple’s first child.
“He was more of a family man than most other people on campus,” Elias said.
According to Rosenthal, Bihlmaier was one of the Business School students who often brought their spouses to class. When Bihlmaier introduced his wife to his classmates, the couple’s strong bond was evident. “When Nate would bring Nancy to class, his introductions for her made it so obvious how he felt about her,” said Rosenthal. “Nancy is very much part of our section community.”
Bihlmaier was so excited to become a father that he started a blog on fatherhood, said Harvard Business School spokesperson Brian Kenny.
Bihlmaier’s wife could not be reached for comment.
Most of all, friends and classmates said they would miss Bihlmaier’s thoughtfulness and insight in their conversations.
“Conversations with him were never superficial,” Rosenthal said.
Bihlmaier was a devoted student in and out of the classroom. Rosenthal remembered one discussion he had with Bihlmaier about a potential paper topic that carried over into lunch.
“Nate was unique in that he sent me back a two-page bullet-pointed list of specific feedback,” Rosenthal said. “He wanted to respond not just with his own opinion, but how he thought it related to the class.”
Though Bihlmaier was dedicated to his academic work, friends said that he always struck a balance between work and life.
“I really do think Nate was a role model for the rest of us,” said Rosenthal.

Before you hear the comedian Andy Samberg, one of this year's Class Day speakers, Flyby thinks you should know a few things about the man who's sure to elicit more than a few chuckles. Here are five fun facts about the Saturday Night Live star in anticipation of his big speech today.
1. A native of the Bay Area, Samberg attended the University of California at Santa Cruz before transferring to New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, from which he graduated in 2000.
2. Samberg joined the cast of Saturday Night Live in 2005, fulfilling a dream he'd had since he was eight years old.
3. Samberg is a member of the comedy troupe, The Lonely Island, a group that has written a number of popular digital shorts, including "Lazy Sunday," "Natalie Rap" (featuring Harvard alum Natalie Portman '03), and "I Just Had Sex."
4. Samberg frequently collaborates with SNL regular Justin Timberlake, and the two have become good friends. Their 2006 short "D*** in a Box" won a Creative Arts Emmy for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics. Timberlake also makes a cameo in The Lonely Island's hit video "J**z In My Pants."
5. Unlike some Harvard students, Samberg doesn't always aspire to awe everyone with his intellect. Of his sense of humor, he once said, "Stupid is the highest compliment a person can pay to me."
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: May 23
An earlier version of this blog post misspelled the name of Class Day speaker Andy Samberg. The post also misstated the name of the comedy troupe in which Samberg performs. It is The Lonely Island, not The Lonely Planet.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Five years ago, administrators at Harvard envisioned giving Harvard Square a sister.
The younger sibling would be located across the river, slightly smaller but brimming with all of the vivacity of her elder sibling. She was called Barry’s Corner—a proposed hub of commercial and academic activity at the intersection of Western Ave. and North Harvard Street.
Barry’s Corner would enhance the $1 billion, state-of-the-art Science Center a few blocks away, serving as a community nexus for the extension of Harvard’s academic venture across the Charles River.
But that vision never came to pass.
Instead, the plan for Barry’s Corner—like hot breakfast, faculty hiring, and the Allston Science Complex itself—was a victim of the 2008 financial crisis, and today, Harvard Square’s would-be little sister remains a relatively quiet and inconspicuous intersection.
But if plans do not fall through a second time, it will not stay that way much longer.
In December 2011, Harvard officially resumed planning for Allston. Since then, the University has embarked on an open process that will guide Harvard in achieving its vision.
Though the University has promised transparency, not all Allston residents are convinced that Harvard is disclosing enough information. And some ultimately doubt that the University can successfully integrate community and institutional interests.
NEW VISION
Harvard has considered creating a second campus in Allston for more than a decade.
This dream culminated in 2007 when the University released its Institutional Master Plan for Allston. Projecting 30 to 50 years into the future, the document envisioned the creation of a “main street” along Western Ave. and construction of the Allston Science Complex, comprised of laboratories and classroom spaces especially designed for stem cell research.
These projects, however, were halted in late 2009 after the financial crisis dealt a heavy blow to the University endowment.
As Harvard looks to move forward in Allston, some elements of the old plan have remained intact, such as the creation of a bustling hub at Barry’s Corner and a strong academic environment across the river.
“Our goal is that this would be one Harvard and that people will view Allston as part of the campus, just the way Harvard Yard is,” said University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76. “We don’t want people to think of Allston as a distant outpost.”
But the specifics of development are still in flux and could differ significantly from the vision proposed five years ago.
“The crisis, as difficult as it was, provided us an opportunity to pause once we had the foundation finished and to rethink the planning,” said Harvard Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp. “The [Innovation Lab] was something that came out of that self-reflection—that was never something that was in anybody’s plan, and it’s a huge success.”
What kind of science facility the University will construct in place of the Allston Science Complex remains unclear. Previously slated to consolidate stem cell laboratories from around the city, the building could now house a wide range of academic disciplines, from bioengineering to public health, according to administrators.
“There are lots of ideas that could be or are being discussed,” said G. Timothy Bowman, executive dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. “I can say certainly from a SEAS perspective no decisions have been made.”
Even stem cell laboratories are not completely off the table, although many faculty in the Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology department have said they do not feel the need to move given the recent renovation of the Sherman Fairchild building, which exclusively houses SCRB.
The University also plans to actively recruit businesses and companies that complement the disciplines that move across the Charles River—a strategy known as co-development.
Fostering community across the River, Harvard administrators said, is as important as establishing an academic presence there.
“Allston’s growing academic community will both benefit from and contribute to the neighborhood, promoting activity in the area and attracting new businesses and industries to Allston and Greater Boston,” Garber said.
NEW PROCESS
Harvard has resumed planning in what administrators have touted as a “revolutionary” open process, in which Harvard actively solicits feedback from the Allston community on their hopes and concerns regarding development.
This is a departure from Harvard’s last go at development, during which the University did not regularly engage Allston residents in open dialogue. Since January, University officials have presented ideas and solicited feedback from the Harvard-Allston Task Force—a group of Allston residents representing the community—at biweekly meetings.
Residents have played an active role in helping to establish criteria for the selection of a third-party real-estate development partner for the Barry’s Corner Retail and Housing Commons. Additionally, two Task Force members are serving on the University’s internal selection committee for that development partner.
“Barry’s Corner is an example of unique transparency,” said Kevin Casey, Harvard vice president for communications and public affairs. “We’ve never before included community members in an internal selection process.”
Yet despite the University’s celebration of this open process, many Allston residents have expressed doubt over whether Harvard is as receptive to public opinion as administrators suggest.
“Not that much has happened in the public eye, but I have a sense that a great deal is happening outside of the sight of the community,” said Task Force member Brent C. Whelan ’73. “The plan reflects 100 percent of what people on the inside of Harvard see as advantageous, what they would feel is best for the University. Resident input makes up about zero percent.”
“They know what we’re thinking, but we don’t know what they’re thinking,” said Task Force Chair Ray V. Mellone.
OLD COMPLAINTS
Though Harvard has made some tangible progress in Allston since halting construction in 2009, the University’s ambiguous plans and time frame have been of major concern to residents in the past several months.
According to Casey, Harvard has recruited 19 new businesses to its space in Allston that have generated more than 380 new jobs. In addition, he pointed to the Education Portal and Innovation Lab as examples of new facilities that are mutually beneficial to Harvard and the Allston community.
Despite these indicators of progress, many Allston residents are not satisfied with the pace of development.
Whelan acknowledged the spate of new businesses Harvard has recruited to occupy its Allston holdings but said that those efforts have done little to help bring about Harvard’s grander vision.
“The businesses Harvard has brought have been relatively inconsequential,” Whelan said. “I would not say Western Ave. has become a lively hub.”
Some have raised questions about the site on which the Charlesview Apartment Complex currently sits. The University acquired the land in 2007 in exchange for a slightly larger plot nearby, but Harvard has not outlined distinct plans for the site further than designating it as land for “institutional use.”
“Regardless of what the use, the site will be part of a mix that will serve to enliven the area,” Casey said, reiterating a sentiment he has expressed at Task Force meetings many times in the past few months.
Nevertheless, Allston residents are uncomfortable with the ambiguity of the University’s designs.
“I think there’s a lot of disappointment in Allston that so little progress has been made, especially regarding Barry’s Corner and planning for the Charlesview site,” said Task Force member Harry E. Mattison.
Mattison and other residents pointed to the paused Science Complex—which has remained an exposed concrete foundation for more than two years—as an example of Harvard’s lack of significant progress.
“I think there have been a lot of nice, small steps in the right direction which are good, but at the same time are overshadowed by the uncertainty that surrounds the major developments,” Mattison added.
Administrators do not deny that progress is slow.
“We’re taking some strong steps forward, but much of the tangible manifestations in actual physical development is yet to occur,” Casey said. “Selection of the real estate partner on Barry’s Corner will be an important first step.”
In addition to selecting a developer in June, the University is expected to submit a draft of a new Institutional Master Plan to the Boston Redevelopment Authority by October.
Some community members remain optimistic about Harvard’s efforts to engage the community. John Cusack, one of two Task Force members sitting on the University’s committee for selecting a developer for Barry’s Corner, said he understands the concerns of his neighbors but trusts Harvard’s slower pace.
“To me, this is a starting point, and because of its importance, there was a certain amount of time it had to take,” he said. “I don’t want to make it sound like I was remotely happy with the wait, but the fact is, this is clearly a newly-defined approach which I hope will have positive implications for the community.”
Administrators hope that the University’s continued progress will eventually allay community concerns about development.
“Harvard Yard was not built in a day but evolved over 375 years. There were high-level guidelines established that shaped building over time,” Lapp said. “We are looking to do the same thing with the Master Plan in Allston.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1986, in the spring of her freshman year, Pamela M. Conover ’89 expected to move down Dunster Street to Eliot House, where she and her rooming group had been assigned. Instead, she was informed that she would be living in Wigglesworth, only one entryway over from her freshman year room.
Conover and her four future roommates had been thrilled to be placed into Eliot, their first-ranked upperclassmen House.The women had friends who were already in the House, and were attracted to Eliot’s proximity to the Yard and its prime view of the Charles River.
Eliot House, Conover recalled, seemed “as good as it gets.”But that summer, the women learned that Eliot did not have room for them.
Instead, the five sophomores would be moving into Wigglesworth Hall, a freshmen dorm, when they returned to campus in the fall. “We were quite distressed,” said Conover. “It was not the big change we were looking forward to.”
In fall 1986, Conover and her roommates were five of about twenty Winthrop and Eliot sophomores who were sent to live in Wigglesworth.Another two Winthrop sophomores had to live in the Winthrop Master’s Residence with then-Masters James A. and Martha J. Davis.
The 1986-87 academic year saw widespread housing shortages and upheaval due to enrollment miscalculations, renovations in the Quad, and a separate system for transfer students. But despite the inconveniences caused by the housing shortage, alumni said that their unusual housing arrangements in fall 1986 brought them closer together. House life, many alumni said, was even sweeter when they were able to move into their assigned Houses.
CROWDED ON THE RIVER
In the fall of 1986, an unusually low number of undergraduates took time off or chose to live off campus, leading to an atypically low attrition rate.With more students than beds in the river Houses, administrators turned to non-traditional housing options to ease the crunch.
According to Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67, who was Assistant Dean for the House System at the time, his office chose Wigglesworth, one of the dorms closest to the river Houses, in an effort to minimize the distance between the sophomores and their classmates in the Houses.
But some of the students who were unable to move out of the Yard as sophomores were disgruntled at being denied this rite of passage. An outraged Crimson editorial reported that one sophomore was so surprised by his Wigglesworth room assignment that he thought it must have been a joke .The editorial also suggested Harvard’s promise that the residential house system served as a home was “a cruel farce.”
Brooke A. Masters ’89, who covered the housing upheaval for The Crimson, recalled that students were frustrated because they believed that Harvard had broken its promise to provide all upperclassmen with its unique brand of residential housing. “Harvard markets itself as, ‘You’re going to be in the Houses, you’re going to have on-campus housing,’” Masters said.
Even sophomores who were able to move into their new Houses were upset by the housing arrangements.Gillian Darlow ’89, who lived in a cramped triple bedroom in Eliot that fall, recalled being disappointed that Conover’s rooming group, which included several of her close friends, was so far away.“They were completely isolated from us,” Darlow said.
But Darlow said that the space constraints that she and her roommates faced as a result of overcrowding proved to be a blessing in disguise. The crowded conditions, she said, “made us all a lot closer. We were so on top of each other and it made us have to get to know each other.”
NO SPACE IN THE QUAD
In the mid 1980s, Harvard launched a multimillion dollar renovation project to bring the substandard Quad housing up to par.In fall 1986, Cabot’s Eliot Hall was renovated, displacing about fifty Cabot House sophomores to apartments at 29 Garden Street.Additional students in North House, now Pforzheimer, spent the semester living in the Botanic Gardens Apartments at 28 Fernald Drive, while Moors Hall and Holmes Hall underwent construction.
David J. Schiffman ’89, a Cabot affiliate who spent the first semester of his sophomore year living at 29 Garden Street, recalled the disproportionate impact of the housing shortage on sophomores. “We were definitely the lowest on the totem pole,” Schiffman said. “It really was not a good way to get integrated into the house by being three blocks down in an apartment building.”
John C. Reece II ’89, another displaced Cabot sophomore, was disappointed by what he viewed as the unfulfilled promise of the Harvard housing system. “You have this Harvard rooming group mentality of a common room with the rooms off of it and all the social interaction is formed by that,” he said. “And then you get put into a regular apartment off a hall.”
Displaced Quad affiliates also described their temporary housing as uncomfortable.Schiffman remembered 29 Garden Street as a “smelly old place” where even in the winter “you couldn’t keep the heat on because it was just so hot.”
But Schiffman’s memories of his semester at 29 Garden Street are not all negative.That semester, Schiffman met John T. Schiavone ’89, his roommate at 29 Garden Street, who became one of Schiavone’s “best friends from college.”
NO ROOM FOR TRANSFERS
In June 1986, the College informed new transfer students that it could not guarantee them a spot in a residential House due to the housing shortage. All new transfer students would have to find housing either in Harvard-affiliated apartments or on their own.
At the time, one transfer student told The Crimson that he was so dismayed by Harvard’s transfer student housing policy that he almost went to Stanford instead.
But L.D. Wood-Hull ’88, a junior transfer student from Wheaton College, said that he chose to come to Harvard despite knowing that he would not live in one of the twelve residential houses. “I was sitting down with all my possibilities and options,” Wood-Hull recalled. “Coming to Harvard without being in one of the residential houses was the best option, so I was happy to have that choice.”
SPRING HOMECOMING
With the start of the second semester of the school year, the housing situation improved for some students who had been affected by the shortage. A more normal attrition rate that spring allowed some of the sophomores in Wigglesworth to move for the first time into Eliot and Winthrop. Conover recalled being “really excited” to finally move into Eliot House, which was nearer to the river and closer to her friends.
By January, displaced Cabot residents were also allowed to move back into their House after renovations of Cabot’s Eliot Hall were complete.
Reece described the experience of moving into Cabot House as a second-semester sophomore as analogous to “going to the Ritz-Carlton.”“Everything was perfect white, the floors were all redone,” he said. “It was amazing. We felt very spoiled.”
For Reece, after a semester of living among adults in an apartment building, being in Cabot meant that “suddenly you’re back among kids.”
Despite having missed a semester, Schiavone remembered that he and the other sophomores had no difficulty integrating into the House community when they moved into Cabot. “I didn’t feel like we were odd men out,” Schiavone said.
The housing outlook even began to look brighter for transfer students.In March, Harvard announced that it would subsidize rent for any students who wished to live in Harvard-affiliated apartments.
“Some students were really excited about the idea,” said then-Housing Officer Lisa Colvin Zengilowski. “Even though there was this challenge and this crunch in housing, it turned into a win-win situation that allowed us to think about how to better look at transfer students.”
Today, as Harvard anticipates another housing shuffle resulting from the upcoming House renewal project, Dingman said that the 1986-87 housing shortage provided administrators with important lessons about how to best manage a housing crunch.
Dingman said that administrators learned the importance of providing contiguous and high-quality space for displaced students, as well as a robust residential staff of tutors to help ensure community.Still, he admitted that temporary housing is “not the same as living in the House proper.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On March 20, 1987, the Food and Drug Administration approved AZT, azidothymidine, for use as an antiretroviral drug to slow HIV/AIDS’ progress and effectively reduce the infectiousness of the virus.
The discovery of AZT’s new use was made by two Harvard researchers, Martin S. Hirsch and Jerome E. Groopman, sending shockwaves through the United States. HIV/AIDS had claimed 50,280 lives between 1981—when the first cases were reported in the U.S.—and 1987, and Groopman’s and Hirsch’s discovery signaled possible relief to a seemingly relentless virus.
But this finding garnered responses that ranged from enthusiastic to critical, like much of the work concerning HIV/AIDS and gay communities done during the 1980s.
Though the drug, when taken alone, proved ineffective in the long run and caused negative physical side effects, AZT’s reception shed light on a crisis that rocked the Harvard campus and nation as a whole.
‘A GLIMMER OF HOPE’
With limited information on its transmission, pathology, and, most alarmingly, treatment, HIV/AIDS seemed for many to be a death sentence until 1986 when Groopman and Hirsch discovered that AZT could serve as a treatment for HIV/AIDS.
The drug was originally developed as a treatment for cancer, which was believed to be caused by environmental retroviruses. At that time, AZT was seen by many as a miracle drug, delaying a virus that was stumping doctors and claiming thousands of lives.
Hirsch said that his revolutionary finding provided a renewed sense of hope for many individuals affected by HIV/AIDS. “After this horrible disease had been around for six years, or known for six years, the patients in all the hospitals were dying without any hope whatsoever,” he said. “People saw a glimmer of hope that we could do something about it.”
Jeffrey Epperly, longtime AIDS activist and former editor of “Bay Windows,” a Massachusetts LGBT newspaper, witnessed first-hand the desperation that infected many diagnosed with HIV/AIDS prior to Hirsch’s and Groopman’s discovery.
“Before AZT, it was not uncommon to hear perfectly rational people diagnosed with AIDS who had no other mental health comorbidities to consider suicide as a viable option. I think the promise of anti-retroviral treatment changed that,” Epperly wrote in an email to The Crimson.
TOLERANT BUT FEARFUL
Jonathan H. Mermin ’87-’88, now the Director of the Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention at the Center for Disease Control, said that HIV/AIDS was an important topic within the undergraduate community.
“It was a very common topic of discussion; it was associated with gay men so homophobia played a part in the discussion,” Mermin said. “There was great interest and fear, but there was mostly a sense that it was involving others.”
Once clinical trials proved that the virus could be transmitted to heterosexuals as well, student concerns changed. Mermin, who had done research on the intersection of public policy and science in AIDS research, was asked by friends for information about the virus.
“People would pull me aside when they started relationships. They would ask, ‘How do I keep myself safe from HIV?’” Mermin said.
Though AIDS was highly controversial throughout the rest of the country, Harvard as a whole seemed to be relatively ahead of the times.
“It was a tolerant campus,” said Eric A. Berman ’88.
Students on campus worked to understand the epidemic and the “emotionally complicated” plight of AIDS patients, according to Berman. Berman,  a member of the Institute of Politics’ Student Advisory Committee in 1987, helped produce the Committee’s rendition of “The Normal Heart,” a semi-autobiographical play by Larry Kramer that centered on the HIV/AIDS epidemic in New York City during the early 1980s.
AN IMPERFECT CURE
According to Hirsch, AZT was the first step to a comprehensive treatment for HIV/AIDS. “AZT was not the first drug that we had looked at, but it was the first drug that had any promise,” he said.
However, the drug proved less effective than anticipated. Epperly recalled many who, despite beginning the drug therapy shortly after its release, fell ill and eventually died.
“For a lot of people, it showed early promise, but either had insufferable side effects or stopped working effectively too soon,” he said.
Mermin recalled strong debates over whether AZT was more harmful than helpful for AIDS patients. “The activist community was concerned that the [drug’s] toxicity outweighed the potential benefits,” he said.
As time passed, researchers expanded upon Groopman’s and Hirsch’s discoveries to find drugs that better tempered the ravaging effects of HIV/AIDS.
Nevertheless, the discovery of AZT was a landmark on the road to removing the stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS and the communities often associated with it. “I think AZT in retrospect was a minor advance, it was a conceptual advance... I think the subsequent improvements in therapy greatly reduced the stigma,” Hirsch said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Paul J. Finnegan ’75 has been selected as the newest member of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, the University announced Wednesday. Finnegan’s appointment is the latest in a series of additions to the Corporation as part of a multi-year restructuring that includes the imposition of term limits and an expansion in the number of members.
Finnegan, who is the co-CEO of Chicago-based investment firm Madison Dearborn Partners, has been an active and visible Harvard alumnus. He currently serves on the University’s Board of Overseers, Harvard’s second-highest governing body, and was previously the president of the Harvard Alumni Association. He has also served on a number of councils and advisory boards across the University, from Harvard Business School to Harvard School of Public Health.
“I often marvel at how Paul Finnegan seems to be everywhere,” University President Drew G. Faust said in a press release. “It’s remarkable how much he does for Harvard, and how he does it with such enthusiasm, such a thoughtful and probing manner, and such concern for how we can always do better.”
The Corporation, which is the oldest corporate body in the Western hemisphere, announced in 2010 that it would enact the first major structural changes in its history in order to improve transparency and accountability. The plan expanded the Corporation’s membership from seven to 13 members. Finnegan is the fourth appointment since the announcement and the second of the new members to have served on the Board of Overseers, which is the larger of Harvard’s two governing bodies.
“I’m especially pleased to be able to take on this new role at a time when the Corporation itself is in the midst of important changes and when the University is pursuing new approaches,” Finnegan said in the press release. ”This seems to me a particularly interesting moment of transition and possibility for Harvard, and it will be a privilege to continue working with President Faust and others to make the most of it.”
As a corporation member, Finnegan will be responsible for helping make some of the University’s most pressing decisions. Senior Fellow of the Corporation Robert D. Reischauer ’63 cited Finnegan’s knowledge of finance as a skill that would benefit the Corporation.
“Paul Finnegan is one of Harvard’s most devoted, energetic, and accomplished alumni leaders,” Reischauer said in the press release. “He will bring us not only important financial and organizational expertise and a deep knowledge of the University and its governance, but also a broad set of relationships across the community.”
Finnegan’s appointment will begin July 1 and last until 2018, with the possibility of extending his service for a second six-year term.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For most people, Saran Wrap is used to keep food fresh, but for Lucius Chiaraviglio ’86, the plastic covering was part of a perennial survival tactic during his time at Harvard.
The former Currier House resident, who is allergic to the toxins in cigarettes, used to cover the exhaust pipes in his bathroom with Saran Wrap to reduce the smoke filtering in from neighboring rooms.
“I got gassed when I was in Currier,” he said almost bitterly.
But just before graduating, Chiaraviglio enjoyed a reprieve from his health concerns. It came in the form of a ban on smoking in public places, passed by the City of Cambridge in February of 1987.
Harvard was tasked with complying with the ordinance, and between signs and house newsletters, administrative meetings and conversations between House Masters, smoking was restricted in many indoor common spaces.
A SMOKER’S RIGHT?
Despite all the regulations, the campus smoking culture did not disappear.
“It was kind of cool back then,” said Salvador A. Litvak ’87, a rower in Adams House who spent hours in the dining hall eating and talking with his teammates.
“If you go to look at movies...you’ll see all the hip people smoke,” added Alice Wolf, a member of the City Council in 1987.
When Chiaraviglio fought to ban smoking in the Houses even before the city-wide ordinance, he was impeded by the “virulent” members of his House Council.
“It seemed like an awful lot of people considered it a civil right to smoke but they didn’t consider it a civil right to breathe clean air,” he said.
Even administrators were nervous about the effects of a ban. When it was mandated in 1987, Mohan D. Boodram, a resident tutor in Currier House at the time, said he and his colleagues were worried that those with severe sensitivity to smoke would use the ordinance to complain straight to the city—rather than the College—about smoke escaping into hallways from private rooms.
“We were really trying to think about every possible contingency,” he said.
However the new restrictions did not entirely change students’ actions. Despite the changes, students probably continued to smoke where they were not allowed, according to Donald H. Pfister, master of Kirkland House in 1987.
THE LAST PUFF
Nevertheless, smokers were a minority—about ten percent of the student population, according to D. Joseph Menn ’87, a former Crimson editor. Many were of what students and the faculty at the time call “high-class.”
Jerome H. Doolittle, a professor from 1985 to 1990, left an ashtray out for students to use when they had conferences with him. Only one student ever took advantage of the offering.
And change gradually took hold.
When Litvak first came to Adams—unanimously remembered as having the highest proportion of smokers—as a sophomore, there were only four non-smoking tables in the dining hall. By the time he graduated, those four tables were the only ones for smokers. As athletes, Litvak and his friends did not smoke, fostering a culture he felt might have contributed to the reduction in smoking tables.
Dunster House was the last to forbid smoking entirely in the dining halls although the ban did not go into effect until 1992.
Despite the changing rules about smoking areas, those who continued the habit could still be seen “clustering outside entrances of buildings,” according to Boodram.
UP IN SMOKE
Many anti-smoking advocates thought the Cambridge ban should be implemented at the state level as well. But while the negative health effects of smoking were widely acknowledged, the most contentious debate, says Wolf, centered on smoking in local restaurants and bars.
“Communities feel competitive in that regard,” she said, explaining that without a consistent ban, eateries worried they could lose business depending upon their smoking allowances.
“You got to be careful to balance,” said current City Manager Robert W.  Healy. “Clearly one would always err to the side of public health, but you do have to watch the impact on business development.”
Tommy’s House of Pizza—a popular hangout spot for students—featured heavy smoking that disappeared after the ban, according to Menn.
Restaurants 		were not the only ones who had to adjust to the new rules. Leavitt & Peirce, a tobacco shop on Mass. Ave, had an upstairs smoking parlor before early 1987. But under the ordinance, businesses that wanted to be smoker-friendly could not allow individuals under the age of eighteen into the store.
For Leavitt & Peirce, which sells everything from antique memorabilia to chess sets, children’s toys, and sports equipment, this was impossible.
“We have to be all ages here,” said Paul J. MacDonald, owner of the store. “It wasn’t a hard decision,” he added of eliminating the smoking parlor.
MacDonald said the biggest effect of the ban was on his cigar business. Customers were less likely to come in and buy a cigar during the winter, he explained, because they could not stay and smoke in the warmth of the store’s interior.
For Michelle M. Durocher, a library assistant in the cataloging department, the ban on smoking in public places signaled a pivotal shift in the smoking culture on campus.
“I remember this vague sense of smoke in the building all the time,” she said of Widener Library. “It’s never really gone.”
She and a few colleagues achieved a “big victory”: a tiny, closet-sized non-smoking staff room. Durocher would thread her way through tables in the big, smoking staff room holding her breath to get to the closet.
Durocher did not have to hold her breath for much longer.
As in Adams House and elsewhere in the College, the smoking and non-smoking spaces ultimately switched.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In September 1986, Harvard University President Derek C. Bok and Dean of the Graduate School of Design Gerald M. McCue cut into a massive cake sculpted to resemble the building that stood behind them—the Design School’s iconic Gund Hall.
Across campus at the Kennedy School of Government, Dean Graham T. Allison ’62 led another celebration, featuring visits from Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56, Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger ’68, and Saudi Arabian oil minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani.
In a year that brought a 350th anniversary for Harvard, two of its younger graduate schools had their own reasons for festivities. They were each commemorating their 50th birthdays. Their jubilee year became an occasion not only to invite celebrities and call caterers but also to reflect and look forward, as both schools faced the future questioning their roles within the University. The 50th anniversary marked the beginning of these graduate schools’ shift from a professional orientation to a more academic approach.
PASSING THE TORCH
For the Kennedy School, the anniversary celebration was focused on an examination of the ideals upon which it had been founded. Fifty years after Lucius N. Littauer, Class of 1878, had marked Harvard’s 300th anniversary with a founding donation of $2 million and 20 years after the graduate program had been renamed in memory of slain President John F. Kennedy ’40, HKS had finally come into its own.
Francis M. Bator, Lucius N. Littauer professor of political economy emeritus, recalled the uncertainty following the school’s 1966 renaming. “Would we ever grow into a major independent graduate school? For perhaps a decade or so there was bound to be a question about that,” said Bator. But by the 1980s, Bator said, the Kennedy School “had made a place for itself on the map”.
Allison, who was dean of the Kennedy School during its anniversary year, said that the 50th anniversary celebration coincided with a more widespread recognition of the School’s legitimacy. “By 1987 we had a campus, a strategy,” Allison said. “It was clear that the Kennedy School existed and was going to become one of the features of Harvard.”
BEYOND BLUEPRINTS
The Graduate School of Design’s influence had been growing as well, demonstrated by the 2,000 guests who joined the approximately 450 graduate students of the time for events commemorating the school’s history.
Among the most distinguished guests was Prince Charles of Wales, who had requested to visit the Design School during his trip to Harvard for the University’s 350th anniversary festivities. An anonymous donor established a prize for international urban design in honor of the Prince, a professed design enthusiast, though some faculty at the Design School criticized the royal visitor’s distaste for modern architecture.
The Design School hosted symposia on the history and future of the school and showcased exhibits of archives and student work from the past and present.
These exhibitions illustrated the growth of Harvard’s commitment to design. From a small faculty based in Robinson and Hunt Halls, the full-fledged school had expanded its programs in Gund Hall, its own building.
“The quality of the student work was an important cause to celebrate and a telling sign of our growth,” said McCue.
MORE PROFESSOR THAN PROFESSIONAL
For some at both schools, the 1987 anniversary marked the early days of a new outlook that valued academic research, not just professional development.
Professor Mark H. Moore said that since its 50th anniversary, the Kennedy School has veered from its original programs for government professionals.
“We were close to the zenith of our work at that time,” Moore said, reflecting on the 1987 state of the executive education program, a career development course that he helped found. “The Kennedy School has been drawn back from the professional frontier to a place that’s more comfortable in the world of academia and less useful to the world at large.”
Today, Moore said, “There’s always a pressure on professional schools to look more and more like academic departments.”
Echoing Moore’s belief that graduate schools defend their reputation for academic legitimacy within the University, Professor Alex Krieger, who helped lead some of the Design School’s symposia in 1986, noted that the school has sometimes been viewed as “not scholarly enough.”
In the fall of 1986, the first students enrolled in new Master in Design Studies and Doctor of Design programs, an initial step toward what Assistant Dean for Internal and External Communications Ben Prosky called a new interest in research and “design thinking” that heightened the school’s academic profile.
McCue said, “I felt that the programs we were bringing to the school would allow the school to tackle some of the larger problems that exist in the profession and for society, like housing and sustainability.”
Krieger praised the new degree programs for bringing a more diverse group of students to the school. Now, he said, students and faculty with widely varying backgrounds more frequently address issues like ecology and urbanization together.
The collaborative spirit extended across the University as well. The Design School had established joint degree programs with the Kennedy School and the Law School and had recently begun planning joint courses with the School of Public Health.
Looking back on the mentality that characterized both schools in their 50th year, faculty saw institutions that changed over time.
Prosky said that Gund Hall was designed so that sunlight could enter through its skylights, illuminating students’ drafting boards to enable easier design. This sunlight now creates a glare for the students who work on computer screens. “Who knows?” he asked. “In 25 years, will there be holograms instead?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When, in 1987, Peter D. Sagal ’87 began recording trivia questions about current events on the answering machine for his Quincy dorm room phone, he could never have known that 25 years later, he would be making a living doing something very similar for National Public Radio.
Sagal, now the host of NPR’s popular news game show, “Wait Wait...Don’t Tell Me,” never intended to be a radio host. But, after spending a decade writing plays, scripts, and screenplays, and taking odd jobs, Sagal landed at the helm of the show, where he has stayed for the last fourteen years.
BATMAN AND ROBIN
Growing up in suburban New Jersey, Sagal said that his mother, who obtained a master’s degree from Harvard, encouraged him to go to Harvard from an early age.
“She concocted this notion, really early, that I would go to Harvard,” Sagal said.
The first conversation he remembered having with his mother about Harvard was at the ripe age of five.
Sagal indeed earned a spot in the Class of 1987, and in the fall of 1983, he moved into Pennypacker Hall, where he first met his roommate Jess M. Bravin ’87, now the Supreme Court correspondent for the Wall Street Journal.
Bravin and Sagal became friends, and later that year, began one of their first projects—the Pennypacker Visiting Speakers Committee.  Both were disappointed to be placed in Pennypacker, which at the time was in such disrepair that, according to Bravin, “the place looked like a decrepit slum,” with peeling plaster and doorknobs that fell off when turned.
In response to this affront, the two hatched a scheme to get back at the University—convince the administration to pay for a speakers series that attracted washed-up movie stars and treated them as academics.
The pair chose, as the first Pennypacker Visiting Speaker, Burt Ward, the actor who played Robin the Boy Wonder on the 1960’s Batman television series.
Ward’s speech began without a hitch, but was suddenly interrupted by members of the Harvard Lampoon, the semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine, led by then president Conan C. O’Brien ’85.
O’Brien ran off with Ward’s costume, which was on display on stage, and Bravin remembered watching Sagal attempt to run down and tackle O’Brien in the basement halls of the Science Center, but O’Brien and his cronies escaped. Hostage negotiations followed, with O’Brien tormenting Ward over the phone.
Bravin and Sagal moved to Quincy in their sophomore year, at a time when Houses still had abiding reputations. According to Sagal, “Quincy was the drug house—if you were seriously into dope, you’d go to Qunicy,” but that by the time he left, it was more of “the dorky Jewish house.”
FUNNY PLAYS, SERIOUS TOPICS
Because Harvard had no formalized drama program, Sagal spent much of his time at Harvard immersed in extracurricular pursuits. He directed three plays in his undergraduate career, and after entering the annual competition to write the Hasty Pudding production, he and Bravin were chosen to develop their script, titled “Between the Sheiks.”
Their show garnered a rave review in the Crimson and featured a Sultan and his Harem, a countess, and, among others, a genie whose signature song was “You Rub Me the Right Way.”
After graduating from Harvard, Sagal moved to Los Angeles. Between odd jobs—like performing as an extra on a Michael Jackson music video and writing a screenplay on commission which would eventually become Dirty Dancing 2: Havana Nights—Sagal also spent time pursuing his passion for playwriting.
Much in contrast to his Hasty Pudding roots, Sagal said he enjoys writing “funny plays about serious topics.”
As Bravin put it, Sagal is interested in very serious theater. “Theater that puts you to sleep serious,” Bravin said.
Sagal moved to Minnesota in the early 1990’s after winning a playwriting fellowship. While in Minnesota, Sagal wrote his most successful and well-known play, “Denial,” which focuses on the issue of Holocaust denial. According to Sagal, the play is meant to explore the reasons why Holocaust denial is so bothersome.
“If you really want to piss off a Jewish person,” Sagal said, “try saying the Holocaust didn’t happen.”
ROAD TO RADIO
Two years later, in 1997, after moving to Brooklyn, Sagal got a phone call asking him to be a panelist on a new NPR show called “Wait, Wait... Don’t Tell Me.” Sagal soon replaced Dan Coffey, the original host, in 1998 and has been at the helm of the program for the last fourteen years.
“Wait Wait... Don’t Tell Me” is a weekly game show, featuring a three-person rotating panel, in which contestants are asked to answer questions about the past week’s news. It features guests like actors, political figures, and journalists.
Since premiering in January 1998, the show has gained a weekly audience of 2.6 million and took home a Peabody Award in 2008.
Although Sagal never anticipated a career on radio, he said he is quite pleased with his job. “I get to write jokes about stuff going on in the news, which is what I would do anyway,” he said.
Panelists pointed to Sagal’s ability to foster chemistry between panelists and guide the show effectively as reasons for its success.
According to them, the rapport between Sagal and the panelists is the lifeblood of the show.
“One of the great joys of my life is throwing Peter off his game—I like the look on his face,” said Paula Poundstone, frequent panelist and professional comedian.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a typical week at Harvard College, Michael M. Lynton ’82, who graduated from Harvard Business School in ’87, split his time between discussing classical literature on the steps of Claverly Hall, designing sets for campus productions at the Loeb Theater, and relaxing at the A.D. Club.
The “enormous versatility” that his college friends, many of whom he still keeps in touch with, said they admired has stayed with Lynton in his current position as chief executive officer of the Sony Corporation of America and chairman and chief executive officer of Sony Pictures Entertainment.
Lynton has maintained not only the relationships he made with individuals at Harvard, but also with the greater University. Currently a candidate for the Harvard Board of Overseers, Lynton said that there came a time when he wanted to give back to the University.
“There’s a point at which you get nostalgic,” Lynton said.
Devoted to both his academics and ever expanding social network, Lynton has drawn upon his internationally minded attitude, charismatic personality, and passion for business to become a leader within the technology and entertainment industries.
THE VERSATILE INTELLECTUAL
At the College, Lynton concentrated in history and literature, exploring his passion for English and American classics.
Carroll R. Bogert ’83 said that Lynton was an anomaly when it came to Harvard houses—each defined by a distinct stereotype in past decades. Lynton, a member of the rugby and ski teams, chose to live in Kirkland House, what was then seen as the “jock house.”
However, Bogert said that Lynton did not let the sports he played define him, as he still was very much an “intellectual.”
After studying at an international school in Holland, where his parents lived after fleeing Nazi Germany, Lynton transferred to Phillips Exeter Academy for his senior year of high school.
It was there that he met Michael D. Guttentag ’82, who said that Lynton’s image as a “learned, wise, scholarly type” was evident even in high school.
David J. Goldhill ’82,  one of Lynton’s roommates, remembered when Lynton attended every class he could during the first weeks of the semester.
“He would come back to the room and say, ‘I just listened to the most fascinating lecture.’ I would tell him, ‘You know you’re never going to take those classes.’ And he knew, but he just enjoyed listening to as many intellectuals as he could,” Goldhill said.
THE COLLEGE SOCIALITE
When Lynton arrived at Harvard in the fall of 1978, Christopher M. Kramer ’82, one of Lynton’s freshman year roommates, said that Lynton did not fit the image he had imagined and instead was more of a “New Yorker” at heart.
“When I got the list of who my roommate was, next to Michael Lynton it said ‘The Hague, Holland.’ I was expecting a little Dutch boy. He was far from it,” Kramer said.
During his time at the College, Lynton found a place in a range of social groups across campus—from the “elite euro types” to Kirkland’s “rowdy jocks” to Adams’ “hipsters” to Lowell’s “more straight-ups,” according to Bogert.
John “Janno” N. Lieber ’83-’84 remembered when Lynton helped him find a place to store his dorm furniture for the summer and carry it all across Harvard Square.
“He’s one of those people who was always stepping up to help you,” Lieber said.
But the focus on his friends did not stop Lynton from spending time with his family. Lynton’s younger sister, Carol “Lili” R. Lynton ’83 joined him at Harvard in 1979. Nearly every Sunday, the siblings met to call their parents. They maintained a strong connection to the international community, yet another group that Lynton became a part of.
THE BUSINESS MAN
Soon after graduation, Lynton headed to Wall Street, where he worked as an investment banker.
“That was a riptide that was sucking a lot of people in. It was the easiest thing to do at the time,” Lynton said.
Lynton eventually decided to leave his job and return home to Holland. As he struggled to decide what to do next, Lili suggested that he come back to the United States and enroll at Harvard Business School with her.
Unlike at the College, Lynton’s time at the Business School was not spent pursuing an active social life, but rather engaging with his other passion—business. He and Lili became a two-person study group to get through the rigors of the Business School.
And his drive did not diminish when he entered the corporate world with a MBA in hand.
“Personalities are such an important part of the entertainment business,”said Lisa M. Henson ’82. “He has the ability to move easily among all different kinds of projects.”
Friends said that the dedication and talent that have made Lynton successful were apparent from the time they first met.
“Can you pick out as a kid who you think is going to waltz to the tippy top? Michael was smart, and he has great face. It was clear from the beginning he was on the business track,” Bogert said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Shaun L. Donovan ’87 returns to campus for his class reunion, he and his blocking group will search out an old Frisbee golf course hidden behind Harvard Business School.
In the 1980s, security guards regularly reprimanded the group for hitting students and windows with stray Frisbee tosses as they wound their way through the course.
“I got to know the Charles River well and became very good      at fishing Frisbees out of the river,” Donovan said.
Steven M. Dauphin ’87, a member of Donovan’s blocking group, remembered Donovan as pragmatic and caring—traits that pushed him toward a career in public service.
“As you might expect from an engineer, Shaun first and foremost is a problem solver with a keen understanding of what can realistically be accomplished with a particular set of resources and circumstances,” Dauphin said.
“With that said, for over twenty years, he has been driven by the simple and powerful ideal that every person in this country should have access to safe, decent, affordable housing,” Dauphin added.
BUILDING INTEREST
As an undergraduate, Donovan began working for a homeless shelter in the Square, an experience he called “formative.”
“For me, that was a very important experience in becoming interested in homelessness and housing,” he said.
Later, as a graduate student at the Kennedy School taking a course called “Literature and Political Reflection,” Donovan revisited public service.
“One of the requirements of the class was that every week you do some sort of service in the community around Boston,” Donovan said.
During this time, he worked at the Algebra Project, which aimed to teach math in a new way to students in underprivileged schools.
“It really was a formative experience for me in getting me interested in the work I do now, something I enormously value about the Harvard experience,” he said.
Donovan also attended the Graduate School of Design, where he said he learned to think about his surroundings in a different way.
“I understood things in a way that I never quite understood. We look at things but often don’t really see them. I thought I knew and thought I understood, but I understood in a different way,” Donovan said. “[Attending GSD] was a remarkable transformation for me.”
Donovan also credits Harvard with pushing him beyond his comfort level. One of his professors once said, “Teaching calls us to be more than we think we can be,” Donovan recalled.
The quote describes “what the Harvard experience can be and should be. For me, it taught me to be more than I thought I could be and it inspired me to work in service,” Donovan added.
COMING BACK
Returning to Harvard 25 years later, Donovan is particularly excited to see the people he’s lost touch with.
“One of the fun things about going back is coming across, bumping into someone, that I hadn’t seen in a long time and hearing about the incredible adventures we’ve had,” Donovan said.
And others are looking forward to catching up with Donovan.
“He’s always been very intelligent, very much concerned with how others are doing. He’s very even tempered,” William E.S. Cleveland ’87 said. “I’m really looking forward to seeing him.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As soon as Philip Wilder, a social studies teacher at Moreau Catholic High School in Hayward, Calif., discovered that his former student Rosa “Rosie” Gumataotao Rios ’87 had become the Treasurer of the United States, he went to his computer.
“I sent an email, the basic ‘you-probably-don’t-remember-me’ email,” he said. To his surprise, Rios, who graduated from the school in 1983, replied within an hour.
“It was just wonderful...very humbling,” said Wilder, who then arranged a school-wide Skype conference with Rios.
“There she was in the library on the screen,” he said. “The kids were excited.... You could just see that [they] realized that there’s no ceiling. The sky’s the limit.”
Through a combination of directed action, staunch commitment to her family and culture, and professional charm, Rios had risen through the ranks of academic and professional success, moving from shelving books at a local library during her high school years to signing her name on U.S. currency today.
‘WHIRLING AND STAMPING’
Hailing from the East Bay area of California, Rios grew up in a close-knit family comprised of a single mother and nine children.
“My mom always emphasized education,” said Rios, who was the first child in her family to go out of state for college. “It was ingrained in every single one of us.”
Given the family’s large size, the Rios children formed “a little community,” said Peter Peabody, who served as the Student Activities Director while Rios attended Moreau Catholic High School.
As a result, Peabody said, “Rosa is very inclusive and very family-oriented.”
Though she missed home “every day,” Rios said that she found a community at Harvard within Winthrop House, which was “very much a family,” and through student organizations such as Ballet Folklórico de Aztlán, which provided an outlet for artistic expression and offered her a chance to “go back to [her] roots.”
“One of my favorite memories was Rosie teaching me and [our roommate] Marie some of her Mexican dances,” said Diane L. Dorsey ’87, who lived with Rios in Matthews in their freshman year. “We had a great time, whirling and stamping, although I am not sure that the proctor who lived below us enjoyed the experience as much.”
According to Rios, her commitment to the dance group fueled her involvement in the Harvard Foundation, a University-wide organization designed to promote interracial relations. Rios served on the Foundation’s student advisory committee to help coordinate Harvard’s inaugural Cultural Rhythms, an annual festival that features a variety of ethnic performing groups.
“She really [fit] in the Harvard Foundation’s model,” said Harvard Foundation Director S. Allen Counter, calling Rios “an active student leader” and “one of [his] favorite people.”
Counter often requested Rios’ presence at official meetings regarding race relations at Harvard and the execution of Cultural Rhythms, and he invited her to speak at a University-wide panel about cultural diversity in 1986.
“She was always very calm, professional, and poised in nature,” he said. “She displayed tremendous leadership in race relations...[and] worked very closely with me on creating something that was unique to Harvard at the time.”
Natalie S. Manzo ’87, who was one of Rios’ closest friends, said that it “makes sense” Rios would have helped organize Cultural Rhythms given her “polite and professional” manner and “really genuine” personality.
“People always really like her,” she said.
‘WINNING THE LOTTERY’
Rios juggled her extracurricular commitments with formidable academic and work-related obligations.
“I still had to send money home,” said Rios, who worked for an average of 20 to 25 hours a week.
Rios held a job at the Institute for Educational Management at the Graduate School of Education, and, echoing her high school position as a library aide and bookmender in her hometown library, she also worked at Widener Library in her freshman year and at the Winthrop House Library for the next three years.
“To go from the county library in my hometown of Hayward to Widener Library [at Harvard] was like winning the lottery,” she said.
In addition, Rios was one of the College’s first students to pursue a joint concentration in Sociology and Romance Languages and Literatures.
Rios wrote a senior thesis that traced the evolution of Mexican identity in different literary works.
Though enduring evaluations by both departments was “very difficult,” Rios said that she found the experience “very cathartic” as well.
‘A PURPOSEFUL WALK’
Upon her graduation from Harvard, Rios returned to California, where she split her time roughly equally between positions in the public and private sectors, serving as director for economic development for the City of Fremont and working as a principal at the consulting firm Red River Associates.
Victor MacFarlane, managing principal of MacFarlane Partners, the real estate investment management firm where Rios worked before joining the Treasury, wrote in an email that Rios “took her responsibilities as a key contributor and leader very seriously.”
“She wanted to succeed and to succeed at a high level,” he wrote. “While very competitive, she always had a smile on her face and was willing to help someone whenever she could.”
He distinctly remembered Rios’ gait.
“I can still see her walking down our halls,” he wrote. “Rosie has a very purposeful walk...It is almost military in nature that she has a target in sight and intends to get there as soon as possible.”
Indeed, Rios’ drive and expertise in economic development, real estate, and investment management equipped her to fill the post of Treasurer of the United States in 2009.
“I do feel that I was well-groomed [for the role],” said Rios, who now holds the second oldest post in U.S. government.
“I have been very fortunate to have served with such a strong leader as Secretary Geithner. He has provided a very supportive environment,” she said, adding that she takes her role as the first Latina Treasurer to be nominated by a Democratic president “very seriously.”
Though she walks the halls of government buildings today, Rios said that she tries to return to Harvard “every so often” to relive her “warm memories” of Winthrop House and attend Cultural Rhythms, which has greatly evolved since her founding year. She also keeps in touch with Counter, who said that her swearing-in ceremony marked “one of [his] proudest moments.”
“My Harvard experience was extremely worthwhile,” she said. “It was very life-changing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard hockey team sat quietly, devastated. A successful season had ended in disappointment. After losing its leading scorer in a semifinal contest, the Crimson lost three two-goal leads in a defeat by Michigan State in the final game of the 1986 NCAA tournament.
In the locker room, Peter E. Chiarelli ’87 longed to still be out on the ice, celebrating a championship. Growing up under the wings of a former national champion, seeing the trophy case full of awards on a daily basis, it was only natural.
“[My dad] had trophies and plaques from when they won,” Chiarelli remembered.  “Old program stuff I had always seen growing up. We challenged a couple years for a national title. It would have been nice to get one.”
It would take Chiarelli 25 more years to get his trophy, but when he did as general manager of the Boston Bruins, he took an entire city to the top of the mountain with him.
TRIBULATION AND NEAR TRIUMPH
From the beginning, Chiarelli was close to greatness. A plethora of trophies in his house reminded him of that. Chiarelli’s father, Frank, led Rensselaer to the 1954 national title and still holds the NCAA records for goals per game in a career, goals per game in a season, and points per game in a season. The elder Chiarelli went on to set Peter on a quest for hardware of his own, teaching him about hockey and skating outside with him, and his brother Mike, near their icy Ottowa home.
Despite his prestigious hockey pedigree, Chiarelli did not achieve instant success upon his arrival at Harvard.  After a freshman campaign in which the team went 10-14-3, the center suffered through a personally disappointing sophomore year, during which he spent a lot of time on the JV squad. Chiarelli has credited that year with motivating him to work even harder, as he gained a reputation as one of the most determined players on the team.
During his junior year, Chiarelli earned a spot in the regular rotation. In the NCAA tournament that year, the Crimson beat Western Michigan and Denver before facing Michigan State in the finals.
Despite the Crimson’s early two-goal lead, Michigan State netted a goal with just over two minutes left in the third period to take a 6-5 advantage. Harvard was unable to answer.
“Aw man, brutal,” said Mark J. Carney ’87, a former roommate and teammate, about the game’s result. “Brutal.”
“Being in that game and losing ultimately was devastating to a lot of us,” said Donald C. Sweeney ’88, a former college teammate and the current assistant general manager of the Bruins. “We thought we should have won that championship.”
Chiarelli’s junior year ended with a bit of good news though, as he was named the team captain for the ’86-’87 season.
“I wasn’t surprised,” Carney said. “The combination of not just the skill level, but the work ethic, the quiet leadership, the team focus, all those things [helped support] him being captain.”
Under Chiarelli’s leadership, the Crimson looked poised to avenge last season’s championship disappointment and was ranked No.1 for much of the year.
Harvard didn’t even make it to the championship game though, falling to North Dakota in the semifinals, missing an opportunity to challenge Michigan State, which had advanced to the finals.
“We just had a bad day, just had a bad game,” Lane MacDonald ’88-’89 said. “We were extremely disappointed.
To this day, Chiarelli remembers sitting down in that locker room, disappointed, having lost his final college game.
“I think I might have just [told] a few of the guys that they should be proud,” Chiarelli recalled. “It was really disappointing. We started the year 18-0 or something like that, we were ranked No. 1 for most of the year, and I thought we were going to win it. It was really disappointing that we didn’t get to the final game.”
Two years after Chiarelli’s departure, a Harvard team with a number of the same players would finally get a title, and some credited the former captain with mentoring the key contributors on that team.
“We had a lot of great role models on our team who instilled a lot of lessons in us about hard work, commitment, sacrifice,” MacDonald said. “Peter certainly played a role. He was a terrific captain.”
Though Chiarelli may not have personally brought a crown to Cambridge, the experience he earned over his four years in Crimson would prove invaluable later in life. The creation of a championship team, famed coach Bill Cleary, the losses at the doorstep of greatness, and the year of leadership would all help shape Chiarelli.
“You can see the building blocks of what makes a great GM,” Carney said.
GOING BACK TO BEANTOWN
After graduating from college and spending a short time in a European hockey league, Chiarelli headed back home to Ottawa to regroup. After exploring a career in law, Chiarelli eventually joined the staff of the Ottawa Senators, his hometown team.
Sweeney accurately predicted that once Chiarelli committed himself to the business of hockey, he would rise through the ranks quickly.
“He had the former player background from a college standpoint...with the lawyer background and doing all the behind the scenes stuff with Ottawa, it should have been only a matter of time before someone recognized that he’d be a good leader,” Sweeney said.
That time came in 2006 when Chiarelli became the general manager of the Boston Bruins, and renewed his quest for an ever-elusive cup.
FINALLY A CHAMPION
After a last-place divisional finish, the same determination that helped Chiarelli re-emerge in the Crimson lineup helped him prevail on a much larger stage. Over the next five years, the Bruins won their division three times as Chiarelli put together a consistent winning team.
Then, in the 2011 playoffs, Chiarelli got the breaks that went the other way back in the ’80s. Two out of the Bruins’ first three series were decided by one-goal Game 7s. Had the outcome been different, Chiarelli might have been out of a job. Instead, he was in the finals.
To start the Stanley Cup Finals, Chiarelli watched a story unfold that was all too similar to what he experienced in college.
As Boston fell behind 0-2, his chance at the long-sought after trophy appeared to be slipping.
But the resilient Bruins battled back, winning three of the next four games to take the series to a deciding Game 7. In the final moments of Game 7 with Boston up 4-0, it became clear that he had finally reached the pinnacle of his sport. He had done it.
“I just remember going down to the ice and it didn’t seem real,” Chiarelli recalled. “You could just see the emotion all around, the release, the unconditional joy. It’s a feeling I’ve never felt before.”
Friends and former teammates saw a man who had finally achieved his ultimate goal.
“In conversations with him, you could just tell the sense of satisfaction in terms of accomplishing the goal that was so hard to reach,” MacDonald said.
“That was a great way to sort of bring it all together from the first time I met him freshman year just before the first tryout... Less than 25 years later, and he’s lifting the Stanley Cup,” Carney said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was October of her second year at Harvard Law School, and Jennifer M. Granholm—Law School class of 1987, a former beauty queen, and the future first female governor of Michigan—was being investigated by the Law School Ad Board.
Granholm, who is currently the host of ‘The War Room’ on Current TV, had testified on behalf of a fellow law school student, who was accused of trying to start a riot during a protest against Harvard’s investments in Apartheid South Africa. After she admitted that she had attended the protest in order to defend her friend, the Law School Ad Board began investigating Granholm, as well.
Professor Charles R. Nesson ’60—famous for defending Daniel Ellsberg ’52 in the Pentagon Papers case—stepped forward to defend both students, according to the former governor. Granholm was acquitted and her peer only reprimanded.
The movement for divestment—which raised tensions between students and the University during the 1980s—was a defining part of Granholm’s experience at Harvard Law School, and helped to shape the advocate and political figure she would become.
Granholm has continued on that path as a career public servant who served as Michigan’s governor during one of the largest economic crises in the state’s history.
FROM HOLLYWOOD TO HARVARD
Before becoming the first female governor of Michigan, Granholm was the first female tour guide at a marine and wildlife park, which supplemented her income as she pursued an acting career. The winner of the 1977 Miss San Carlos beauty pageant, Granholm moved to Los Angeles the same year to become an actress.
After also working as a Universal Studios tour guide and appearing on the reality television show ‘The Dating Game,’ Granholm decided to pursue a different American dream. She enrolled at The University of California at Berkeley and—when she was a senior—was accepted to Harvard Law School.
“To be able to go to the finest law school in the country was beyond my wildest dreams,” Granholm said, adding that she was the first person in her family to go to college.
While everyone in Los Angeles wanted to be famous, everyone at the Law School “wanted to be president,” according to Granholm, who felt that her peers at Harvard encouraged her to strive for “excellence both in thought and in action.”
Three-quarters through her first year, Granholm met Daniel G. Mulhern—a second year—at Counter M of People Express Airlines in Newark, New Jersey on the way back from spring break.
“Dan courted me during an overnight sit-in outside the Harvard president’s office, in between chants of ‘Derek Bok! Get the Word! This is not Johannesburg!’” she wrote in her book, ‘A Governor’s Story.’
The two were engaged three months later and married in the summer before Granholm’s third year.
A POLITICAL CALLING
From encampments to sit-ins to blockades, Granholm helped to organize the Law School branch of the University-wide divestment movement.
The core group of Law School organizers, made up of Jamin “Jamie” B. Raskin ’83, Michael T. Anderson ’83, Lois P. Murphy ’84, and Granholm facilitated ‘one-a-day protests,’ which functioned like sit-ins, in front of Massachusetts Hall.
“Every generation of students has a political calling,” Raskin said, “And ours was trying to get Harvard to disengage from corporate complicity with apartheid.”
Anderson said that Granholm’s involvement—because of her reputation on campus—lent legitimacy to the movement.
“Jennifer actually gave the divestment movement a lot of credibility because people knew she wasn’t some crazy radical—that she came to it from a moral background,” Anderson said. “Certainly she was not ideologically a leftist so much as just a very earnest and moral person.”
During her time at Harvard, Granholm camped out in front of Massachusetts Hall to defend her cause.
This was only one example of the non-violent confrontation that the organizers incorporated into their protests.
“Jamie came up with the phrase ‘difficult but not impossible,’ [a] presence but not an obstruction,” Murphy said.
Granholm said that the kind of non-violent yet confrontational model that the divestment movement followed was, and still is, highly effective.
“It’s the symbol that there are things more important than one’s self, it’s a symbol that you’re willing to be physically uncomfortable and confrontational,” Grandholm said. “You have to be seen in order for the message to be seen, whether it was protesting at my house or at the steps of the capital, those messages penetrate—those resonate.”
‘NOT DONE YET’
After holding her first elected position as editor of the Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review, at the time the largest journal at Harvard, Granholm went on to graduate with honors.
After graduation, Granholm clerked for a judge on the United States Court of Appeals Sixth Circuit. She later became the first female Attorney General and the first female governor of Michigan.
Raskin said that participating in the divestment movement at the Law School helped the group of young activists sharpen their advocacy skills.
“We were constantly bringing in the ideas we were learning about in school into the movement,” he said.
But nearly 25 years after first applying law to politics, Granholm said that she was done running for office, but not finished serving.
“I’m not done yet, I can tell you that,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“I am particularly pleased and proud to be standing here ‘in the Yard.’  I have heard a great deal about Harvard—who hasn’t?” Charles, the Prince of Wales, said in a speech in Tercentenary Theater, packed with alumni, students, faculty members, and distinguished guests. The Prince of Wales was the keynote speaker on the first of a three-day convocation celebration of Harvard’s 350th anniversary.
The anniversary received attention from some of the country’s largest newspapers, including the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times.
Indeed, even the U.S. Postal Service joined in the celebration, issuing a commemorative stamp with a drawing of John Harvard’s face etched in crimson.
The festivities, which drew 44,000 attendees, were part of one of the largest and most extravagant birthday parties the country has ever seen and brought together members of the Harvard community from the class of 1918 to the Class of 1990 and everything in between.
CRIMSON AND CHRYSANTHEMUMS
On the morning of the first day of the three-day celebration, three flags waved gallantly from University Hall: the flags of the U.S., the U.K.—in honor of Prince Charles’ keynote speech—and Harvard, with its classic Veritas insignia.
The yard had been transformed, according to James D. Solomon ’87, a Crimson editor who covered the 350th anniversary. White chrysanthemums, grown specifically for the event, covered the steps of Memorial Church and four students, two boys and two girls, had been recruited to guard them.
“It was a very serious job, guarding the mums,” recalled Justine A. Harris ’90, the only freshman of the four. “A lot of people wanted to take them, walk off with the Crimson mums.”
“But we did our job and guarded them well,” she added with a laugh.
Yellow chrysanthemums also covered the ground beneath the feet of the John Harvard statue.
In his time at the University, spanning from when he was a student in the late 1950s to the present, John P. Reardon Jr. ’60, director of the Harvard Alumni Association, said he had “never seen” such an elaborate display.
The second day of festivities was intended to close with an extravagant dinner in Memorial Hall organized for the University’s distinguished guests, including alumni, administrators, and faculty members. However, this event never came to be. A group of between 70 and 100 students, alumni, and faculty members calling for Harvard to divest from apartheid South Africa orchestrated a protest, creating a human barricade at the front of the entrance. When the event attendees were unable to pass through the line of activists, the dinner was canceled, the food donated to a nearby homeless shelter, and the already opened wine poured down the drain.
On the third and final day of the celebration, Joanne “Jody” R. Dushay ’89 acted as a standard bearer, representing her class in the Alumni Day procession. After receiving a letter in the mail asking her to be a part of the festivities, she carried a sign with her class year, 1989—one that she has kept to this day.
“When I was in that parade and holding that sign, it was very special,” Dushay said. “And I do remember seeing a woman and saying, ‘that’s very cool, she’s from the oldest class.’”
The standard bearers bore signs with graduation years dating back to World War I, with the oldest coming from the Class of 1918.
Students, community members, alumni, and faculty members alike noted the magical aura on campus.
“You see all the other classes. It’s a unique opportunity to pass through the walls and get an awareness of all the classes that came before you,” Dushay said.
Such a momentous event also called for a large budget. As a student, Charlene H. Li ’88 remembered calling stores to ask for donations in the form of cake, ice cream, and punch—whatever they could offer.
“I just remember how aghast I was,” Li said. “My impression as a student was ‘You want me to call up these people and ask them to donate?’ I didn’t know they would be happy to.”
A REGAL VISIT
Rumors and lore shrouded the visit of Prince Charles of Wales, according to Solomon.
“Someone told me that the prince traveled with a taster,” he said. “I heard it was an old vestige of the monarchy and that a person had to sample the prince’s food before he ate it so that he wouldn’t be poisoned or something.”
Solomon said that he caused hysterical laughter in the British Consulate General when he called to ask the information officer if this rumor was true.
Fifty chosen students were given the opportunity to personally interact with the much talked about Prince after the British Consulate asked the University to invite individuals whose interests overlapped with those of the Prince to attend a reception with him, according to a Crimson article at the time. Students who enjoyed “polo playing, architecture, music, student government, or third world issues” were in luck.
In his speech, Prince Charles acknowledged a possible lack of enthusiasm surrounding his visit, noting that “at least one American newspaper had said it was a definite mistake to invite someone as appallingly undemocratic as The Prince of Wales.”
Before he arrived, Prince Charles was rumored to be an “incredibly stiff” figure, according to Solomon.
Yet, his speech was a tremendous hit.
“He happened to be fantastic,” Solomon said. “He charmed the entire campus, especially with his humor.”
Michael D. Nolan ’88 agreed.
“He actually gave remarks that the listeners really enjoyed and responded to well,” he said.
Despite the criticism he had received, Prince Charles kept the tone of his address light and humorous.
“Have no fear, ladies and gentlemen, I am used to being regarded as an anachronism,” he told the crowd.
“In fact, I am coming round to think it is rather grand—although parents, has it ever crossed your mind as to how you educate an anachronism?” he added. “Perhaps during the course of this address you will find out that it has proved to be a fruitless task.”
A CELEBRATION OF HISTORY
The motivation behind Harvard’s 350 celebrations were “pretty simple” at the end of the day, according to Reardon.
“It was the celebration of a great American icon,” Reardon said, “and [it was] to show the strength of the place.”
He recalled sitting next to a secret service officer during the address of then Secretary of State George P. Shultz when a plane passed overhead.
“A secret service officer turned to me,” Reardon recalled, “and said, ‘Well, that won’t happen again.’”
Sure enough, no second plane ever passed.
“I suppose that you could say,” Reardon said, “that the 350 was telling the world that Harvard was a mighty place.”
“It’s still a mighty place,” he added.
With three convocations, 106 symposia, a ball, and an event attended by 27,000 spectators at Harvard stadium that featured the Boston Pops, the sequence was intended to celebration the University’s expansive history.
“There were all kinds of dinners and things of that sort. There were fireworks like I never saw, showing ‘Veritas’ up in the sky,” said Reardon, referring to the stadium extravaganza. “I remember that [University] President Bok was concerned about what that was going to be like.”
Reardon said that he thought the celebration was an opportunity to enjoy the rich history of the institution.
“I think that people wanted to say, ‘You know, we’ve had a great run as a university. We’re 350 years old and we’re very strong today and we want to celebrate that,’” Reardon said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Between erecting a shantytown in Harvard Yard and disrupting a South African official’s speech in the Science Center, anti-apartheid activists at Harvard in the late 1980s pressured the University to fully divest from companies with ties to South Africa.
Even after Harvard tried to placate critics with a policy of “selective divestment,” student activists continued to protest any investment in South Africa.
Activist pressure played a key role in pushing the University to reduce its South African holdings significantly, ultimately leading to a decrease of $230 million in South Africa-based holdings between June 1986 and January 1987.
Although Harvard never did fully divest from South Africa, 25 years later the student participants look back proudly on the small role they played in the downfall of the apartheid regime.
THE SPIRIT OF THE TIMES
South Africa’s system of apartheid was first instituted after World War II, and worldwide opposition to the system of forced racial segregation developed quickly.
In the late 1970s, a significant movement to divest from South Africa began. It aimed to use economic isolation to pressure the apartheid government to change its policies.
As the movement spread throughout the United States, Harvard resisted calls to withdraw its investments and the original movement eventually lost momentum.
However, Harvard activists in the late 1980s were reinvigorated by Jesse Jackson’s visit in April of 1985.
In front of thousands of Harvard students and onlookers, Jackson denounced apartheid and urged students to “choose the moral high road,” according to a 1985 Crimson article.
“We as undergraduates realized that this was a national movement and that what happened at Harvard mattered,” said Jonathan E. Martin ’88, reflecting on Jackson’s speech.
In some ways, the anti-apartheid movement at Harvard stood out in what was a “fairly apathetic time,” said John N. Ross ’87. “This was not like the 1960s where the whole campus was up in arms.”
Rebecca K. Kramnick ’87, who covered the anti-apartheid movement as a reporter for The Crimson, remembered divestment as being “the issue that got students motivated.”
Douglas C. Rossinow ’88 said he stumbled into campus activism as a freshman at Harvard, arriving on campus in the fall of 1984 as a “neo-conservative student from Long Island.”
Believing that opposition to apartheid South Africa was consistent with his belief in individual rights, Rossinow joined the South African Solidarity Committee, or SASC, exposing him to an organization with somewhat of a “radicalist streak.”
“It was not that ideologically diverse,” said Rossinow, laughing. “As far as I know, I was the only one in the group who had voted for [President Ronald] Reagan.”
Within a year, though, Rossinow found his political alliances shifting. “When I saw that organized, vowed conservatives were such enthusiastic supporters of this despicable regime, that basically severed my ties to Conservatism as a political identity,” he said.
As one of the largest campus groups trying to increase awareness about apartheid, SASC used sit-ins and protests to urge the University to divest from companies in South Africa.
THE ORIGINAL OCCUPIERS
Anti-divestment protests came to a head in April 1986 when SASC led the construction of a symbolic ‘shantytown’ in the middle of Harvard Yard.
Over 200 activists carried the components of the shantytown and their symbolic, 16-foot tall “Ivory Tower” under the cover of darkness, completing their work at 2:15 A.M. on April 16, 1986.
“I wasn’t sure how many people would show up,” said Ross, recalling how he was surprised at the level of support for the protest. “This was the world before internet and email. It just went through the grapevine.”
The shantytown became a living protest, with students sleeping in the settlement and some professors and teaching fellows even holding classes there.
Although many students were sympathetic towards the cause, not everyone was on board. The settlement received a bomb threat on April 18, and on April 22, the Conservative Club built a ‘Gulag’ in the Yard to draw attention to University investment in the Soviet Union.
But as Commencement loomed closer, some students called for the activists to dismantle the settlement to avoid interfering with the event. Ultimately, one-fourth of the Class of 1986 signed a petition calling for its removal.
Meanwhile, the University and the activists were at a standoff; student activists were unwilling to dismantle the shantytown unless the University fully divested, but the University was steadfast in its opposition to doing so.
However, in their treatment of the protestors, according to Ross, the University was “terrified of clamping down too hard and provoking more student sympathy.”
Although SASC members voluntarily removed most of the shanties two days after Commencement, they left some of the larger structures standing.
Administrators took down the last remnants of their protest without the group’s consent, clearing the area where present-day Occupiers would set up a ‘tent city’ 25 years later in the fall of 2011.
“When I read about the Occupy movement, it made me think back to the tactical debates we had within SASC,” said Rossinow. “The shantytown attracted a lot of attention, but I think the group hadn’t really thought through about how it was going to end.”
Despite the controversy surrounding their actions, these students looked back on the shantytown as one of the most successful of their initiatives.
“It made the University administration pay attention,” Ross said. “They had to look over their shoulders.”
REBUILDING THE MOVEMENT
After administrators dismantled the shanty town, anti-apartheid activists were left questioning how to best proceed against staunch University opposition to their demand for full divestment.
Sit-ins and protests continued, coming to a peak a year later.
On March 24, 1987, members of SASC once again seized the limelight when their “symbolic blockade” of the Science Center ended in controversy and an unexpectedly strong administrative backlash.
South African Vice Consul Duke Kent-Brown had begun his speech in the Science Center when around 20 members of SASC left their seats and blocked off the two bottom exits of the auditorium, according to a 1987 Crimson article.
The students, who sang and interlocked arms while blocking the exits, claimed their goal was simply to ensure that Kent-Brown walked through an ongoing rally outside the Science Center.
But Harvard University police officers intervened and escorted Kent-Brown out of the building as he reportedly shouted, “I better not be touched.”
Harvard administrators were prepared for the blockade and suspected that the students would attempt to protest at the event. Harvard Dean of Students Archie C. Epps III had organized numerous meetings with the students throughout the semester to remain informed of their plans.
Fourteen of the students were later found guilty by the Administrative Board of disrupting the speech and were placed on disciplinary probation. Originally, Epps filed up to six charges against each of the undergraduates, although some of the charges were eventually dropped.
FADING ACTIVISM
According to Mitchell A. Orenstein ’89, what was supposed to be a standard, run-of-the-mill   protest became an overblown controversy. For some participants, the resulting controversy over disciplinary action and freedom of speech soon overshadowed their anti-apartheid efforts.
Overall, Harvard’s largest student movement of the 1980s began to die down in spring of 1987, and enthusiasm for the movement was not as strong as it once was.
“The energy in an activist group is never continuous at the same level. It kind of ebbs and flows, and there are all sorts of reasons why that could be,” said Rossinow.
By the spring of 1987, Harvard had sold most of its stocks and bonds in Texaco, Shell, Mobil, and Ford, cutting its investments in South Africa nearly in half.
The move reduced Harvard’s South Africa-linked holdings to their lowest level since 1983.
The decision was partly due to pressure from the activist community, Treasurer of the University Roderick M. MacDougall ’51 said at the time.
Although activists insisted it was not enough, Harvard’s decision to selectively divest from companies in 1987 “[took] a toll” on the student movement, said Orenstein in 1987 to the Crimson.
“I would say that South Africa as an issue was sort of fading,” said Brooke A. Masters ’89, a reporter for the Crimson who covered the Duke-Kent protest. “Harvard had done the obvious thing to do.”
By May of 1987, University President Derek C. Bok asserted that divestment activism had declined, an observation that was affirmed by a spokesman for SASC. “A lot of intellectuals are rethinking if divestment is responsible,” said Orenstein to the Crimson at the time.
LIFE AFTER HARVARD
Just seven years after the Class of 1987 marched at Commencement—crossing the very ground where the shantytown had stood the year before—Nelson Mandela was elected President of South Africa. For student activists, this was a monumental milestone that helped to validate their efforts at the College.
“It was a tremendous joy to see Mandela’s election,” Ross said. “I’m guessing that all of us felt like we had made a small contribution to that.”
Thomas J. Winslow ’87 did not participate in the protests at the time, aside from visiting the shantytown in Harvard Yard once to watch an educational video. After graduation, however, he moved to South Africa, where he witnessed the South African Air Force flying a salute to the newly-inaugurated president in 1994.
Looking back, he recognized the powerful role student activism played in the anti-apartheid movement.
“It simply could not have been done without the international solidarity movement working closely with democratic forces inside South Africa,” said Winslow. “I now appreciate the role of student activists and the international solidarity movement much, much more than I did at the time.”
After graduating, Grossman traveled to South Africa several times, allowing him to observe the country’s transition.
“It’s very fulfilling to know you are on the right side of history,” Grossman said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When news of the Iran-Contra affair in 1986, Harvard professors believed that President Ronald Reagan’s powerful hold over American politics would come to an end in light of the scandal.
For months, Washington was consumed by the fallout from the revelation that President Ronald Reagan’s administration had violated two Congressional impositions—surreptitiously selling weapons to Iran and then using that money to fund the Contras, an anti-communist rebel group located in Nicaragua.
“I think [the affair] marked the end of the Reagan Administration,” said Assistant Professor of Government Laurie Mylroie in a Crimson article published at the time. “It’s going to be a black mark. It’s not going to be forgotten.”
But the Iran-Contra scandal seemingly failed to become the “black mark” on the Reagan administration’s legacy that Harvard professors speculated it would be. And though the furtive affair captivated the nation, Harvard’s fairly liberal campus seem insulated from much of the buzz surrounding the scandal.
FALLOUT AND SPECULATIONS
The initial shock seemed to shake Reagan’s image on the national stage, according to Harvard professors.
“There was a sense of shock—President Reagan had framed his foreign policy in moral terms, and had argued against dealing with terrorists,” said Joseph S. Nye Jr., a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School. “Both faculty and students were surprised to discover the discrepancy between his words and actions.”
The Iran-Contra affair began as an arms-for-hostage exchange, set into motion when Iran secretly asked to purchase weapons from the U.S. in 1985. The Reagan administration was divided on the issue, as some saw this proposal as an opportunity to bring home seven American hostages held by a terrorist group with Iranian ties.
Reagan administrators, following the plan created by Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North, ultimately decided to make the sale and then diverted profits from the weapons sales to support the Contras, despite Congress’s restrictions.
“One issue that people wondered about was whether the President knew about the efforts to get the Iranians involved,” said Marvin Kalb, a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School.
The Reagan-appointed Tower Commission investigated the scandal and found Reagan to have had no knowledge of the dealings, though his back-seat management style of the White House had facilitated the exchange.
Reagan’s connections to the scandal led to a significant dip in his popularity.
“What the hearings showed us was that Ronald Reagan was not exactly micromanaging things at the White House,” said Frank E. Lockwood ’89, a former Crimson editor. “Staffers there had gone rogue, and it seemed to be flying under his radar.”
At the time, Nye believed that the Iran-Contra scandal had weakened Reagan’s presidency.
“At one point, before his open acknowledgement, there was even talk of impeachment,” Nye said.
Lockwood said the dangers to Reagan’s administration were particularly strong in light of the Watergate scandal, a highly controversial political cover-up that forced the resignation of Reagan’s predecessor in the Oval Office, Richard Nixon.
“There was a sense for a time that the Reagan presidency could be in jeopardy. This was only a few years after Watergate,” Lockwood said.
In the end however, conversations about the most recent political scandal made Reagan’s flaws seem small in comparison.
“President Reagan had made mistakes, but he was no Nixon, not even close,” Lockwood said.
A POLITICAL ANOMALY
Carrying 49 of 50 states in the 1984 presidential election, Reagan was a well-liked president in almost every corner of the country. Harvard, however, proved to be an exception.
“Harvard was one of the few places in the country where Ronald Reagan wasn’t popular,” Lockwood said. “There was a lot of opposition to President Reagan from the time he entered office to the time he left.”
The Iran-Contra affair only added to Harvard students’ widespread dissatisfaction with Reagan.
When the news of the scandal broke, liberal students reacted with astonishment.
“Among the people that were more left-oriented, it was kind of shocking,” said Mitchell A. Orenstein ’89, a former Crimson editor. Orenstein recalled that liberal students were concerned that the clandestine affair might escalate to a proxy war in Latin America, presumably under the guise of “fighting communism.”
Conservatives’ response to the scandal was tempered by their relatively small numbers on campus. “Republicans would’ve been a lot more sympathetic [to Reagan], but they were heavily, heavily outnumbered on campus,” Lockwood said.
Harvard Republicans did not place much emphasis on the Iran-Contra issue and chose to focus on United States’ relationship with the Contras, according to Kris W. Kobach ’88, president of the Harvard Republicans Club when the scandal came to light.
Even on a campus where Reagan was overwhelmingly unpopular, the Iran-Contra affair failed to attract significant attention among the student body. “When it became clear that [Reagan] had no personal knowledge of the affair, the scandal moved from outrage to the back burner,” Kobach said.
“I don’t remember that there was any great reaction on campus to the story,” said Kalb. “There were certainly a number of questions asked in class at the Kennedy School, but they were asked in a way that suggested more curiosity and interest than anger.”
Many Harvard students were mobilized by issues such as the South African apartheid, but the Iran-Contra affair did not elicit a similar response.
“The Contra stuff didn’t take off nearly to the same extent as the anti-apartheid movement,” said Orenstein. “There were people who tried to get things going, but it wasn’t something that had a huge amount of activism.”
Some political groups still engaged with the issue of U.S. involvement with the Contras, but the Reagan scandal took a subsidiary role.
“The question of whether the U.S. should be supporting the Contras was the number two issue on campus, but the Iran-Contra affair itself wasn’t really a big issue,” Kobach said. “It didn’t generate its own student protest...[or] major debates.”
LASTING DAMAGE?
Despite speculation from Harvard professors and students that the scandal’s damage to Reagan’s legacy would be lasting, many today admit that Reagan’s reputation has survived the initial attacks.
“I don’t think that the public impression of the Reagan administration was forever soiled by the public response to the Iran-Contra,” Kalb said. “Yes, at the time, it was a major story and an embarrassing story.  But Reagan had a quality about him that did not encourage flamboyant criticism.”
Nye found that Reagan’s effective damage control after the scandal won back favor.
“By owning up to the problem, and changing the personnel in the White House, Reagan was able to recover his balance in the last two years of his presidency,” Nye said.
More than two decades after the incident, Reagan is seen as a beacon of contemporary conservatism, ranked as one of the most popular presidents in history according to a 2011 Gallup poll.
“Obviously there were people who disagreed with him and thought it was a very foolish mistake,” Kalb said. “But Reagan was a Teflon president,”
Reagan’s ability to recover from the scandal was also helped significantly by his reputation as a personable figure.
“Ronald Reagan had real charm, real charisma. They called him ‘The Great Communicator,’” Lockwood said. “People just flat-out liked him.”
