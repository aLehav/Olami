After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Heeding advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as its own faculty, Harvard will indefinitely postpone its 369th Commencement Exercises, University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote in an email Friday.
Thousands of family members, faculty, and alumni from around the world typically crowd Harvard Yard to take place in the traditional Commencement Exercises, which include graduating students from the College, Harvard’s graduate schools, and the Extension School. This year’s scheduled speaker was Washington Post executive editor Martin “Marty” Baron.
Instead of holding the traditional ceremony — which Bacow wrote is “almost as old as the University itself” — the University will host a virtual commencement on the originally scheduled date of May 28.
“No virtual gathering can possibly match the splendor of our usual festivities, but we will come together online on Thursday, May 28, to award degrees so that everyone will graduate as expected,” he wrote. “Each School at Harvard will also host its own special online event and afterwards deliver diplomas through the mail.”
When experts deem it safe for the University to host a large, in-person event, Harvard will put on a belated ceremony for the Class of 2020 with “as many of the traditional campus festivities that typically precede commencement as possible,” according to the email.
Last week, Bacow announced that Harvard would move all classes online after Spring Break. He advised all students across the University to move off campus indefinitely; undergraduates specifically were mandated to vacate their dorms by March 15.
Given the coronavirus pandemic currently raging across the globe, Bacow wrote that it would be difficult to safely hold a gathering of Commencent’s size. As of Friday, six Harvard affiliates have tested positive for COVID-19, according to Harvard University Health Services.
“Given the advice we are receiving from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, other public health officials, and our own faculty, who are among the world’s leaders in infectious disease, epidemiology, and virology, it is difficult to imagine how we could safely hold such a large gathering this spring,” he wrote. “We recognize that people need to start making plans soon, so we thought it best to provide guidance now.”
Bacow added that the University is “exploring opportunities” to hold class reunions, which typically coincide with commencement in May.
“I wish we could give a firm date for this celebration now, but I ask for your patience,” he wrote. “Everything about this year seems to be turning out unusual. When we do hold commencement for the Harvard Class of 2020, I sincerely hope it will also be unusual, but only because it will be among the most joyous commencements in the history of the University.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College published a note to high school juniors Friday detailing revised expectations for applications amid the coronavirus epidemic, writing that applicants will not face penalties if they are unable to submit Advanced Placement test scores or SAT subject test results.
Testing dates for the SAT and ACT college placement exams through May have been postponed or canceled across the world in response to the pandemic. The College Board, which administers the SAT, has also scrapped the in-person component of Advanced Placement exams, which typically take place in the late spring.
Harvard’s note to juniors detailed several areas in which high school students will “not be disadvantaged" if their applications depart from the admissions guidelines the College has used in the past. Applicants will not face a penalty if their high schools move to a pass-fail grading system or if they are unable to retake the SAT or ACT.
“We will continue to look at the whole person as we consider applications next year – as always. Accomplishments in and out of the classroom during the high school years - including community involvement, employment, and help given to your family – will all be considered,” the note reads. “Students who find themselves limited in the activities they can pursue due to the current coronavirus outbreak will not be disadvantaged as a result.”
Finally, the College explained that the pandemic will not impact Harvard’s financial aid program, pointing to the continuation of the program through the 2008 financial crisis. Still, as global markets tumble, many experts believe the pandemic will cause financial woes at Harvard more broadly.
“As was the case during the economic down[turn] a decade ago and in similar situations before, our revolutionary financial aid program will not be compromised in any way,” the note reads. “A majority of Harvard students receive need based financial aid - and loans are not required.”
The College Board canceled the March 28 and May 2 administration of the SAT, noting that it will organize additional opportunities for domestic and international students. The ACT also postponed its April 4 domestic test date to June 13, allowing students to reschedule to a future test free of charge.
The College Board also announced on its website Friday that Advanced Placement exams for the 2019-2020 school year will include 45-minute virtual exams in place of typical in-person components. The organization wrote that it plans to implement digital security features to deter cheating and plagiarism.
“We’ll be as flexible as possible to give students the best chance to show their skills and stay on the path to college,” its website reads.
The June 6 administration of the SAT and SAT Subject Tests is currently scheduled to continue as planned. The next international administration of the SAT is slated for August 29, and the next ACT administration for domestic students for July 18.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard sent the vast majority of undergraduates home to their childhood bedrooms last week. Julian Lee ’22, however, has spent most of his time inside of a hotel room, as he joins other quarantined undergraduates trying to shield their families from the novel coronavirus.
“I haven't left this hotel room for the last five or six days, except to throw out the trash, and each time I do leave, I wear a mask, wash my hands, and do all that,” Lee said. “We're planning on me staying here at least a week, and maybe more.”
The novel coronavirus can incubate in infected people for up to 14 days, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Harvard students vacated campus less than a week ago, meaning undergraduates who may have contracted the virus could still be asymptomatic. As of Friday, six Harvard affiliates have tested positive or presumptive positive for the virus, according to a University website.
Hayato Shiotsu ’22 said he thought there was “a relatively high chance” that he was exposed to the coronavirus at Harvard or while travelling back to his home in Japan. As a result, Shiotsu said he has quarantined himself from friends and has kept close contact with only his family.
“I think it's hard to completely isolate myself from my family. It just happens. It's easier to make sure that I don't go downtown or meet up with friends. That takes more effort to do, so I guess it's easier to refrain from doing that,” Shiotsu said.
Others — like Lee, whose family lives in Taiwan — have taken more extreme measures to limit contact with family members and friends alike. Lee’s father drove him from the airport to a hotel. He has not been back to his house, where sharing a bathroom with his sister would prevent him from self-quarantining.
Once Lee returns home, he said he plans to stay in his room and avoid eating meals with his family for the remainder of the possible incubation period.
He added that most returning travellers in Taiwan have chosen to self-quarantine to protect their families and friends.
“I think that in Taiwan and in a lot of these Asian countries, everyone buys into the idea that this is the collective effort that they all have to make the sacrifice, this temporary sacrifice, so that we can all get back to our way of life as soon as possible,” Lee said. “Whereas in the United States, I think there's not as much of that idea of coming together. It's a lot of like, ‘What's in it for me? Why am I doing this when I am not really at risk? Why am I compromising my individual liberties for others?’”
“I think the faster the general population in the United States can come around to the idea that it really is a group effort, the faster everything can get back to normal,” he added.
Karly Hou ’23, who lives in Palo Alto, Calif., said she decided to self-quarantine to avoid potentially infecting her parents and her grandmother, who lives with her family and is in her 80s.
Still, Hou said she had found ways to maintain social contact with the outside world.
“One of my friends who lives down the street came by my house, and I opened the window and we had a conversation. I would just yell from my window and go back, so that was fun,” Hou said.
After six asymptomatic days of quarantine, Hou said she did not believe she was a carrier for coronavirus, but that she would avoid contact with her family for the 14-day period.
“I think it's well worth it if I can minimize any risk of doing anything to my family,” Hou said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the coronavirus pandemic continues to escalate in the United States, many of Harvard’s teaching and research operations have shuttered as the University attempts to stop the spread of the disease among its affiliates.
But in labs scattered across Harvard’s Longwood campus, its affiliated hospitals, and its research institutes, business has continued as usual — or even ramped up — as researchers from a wide range of disciplines fight to contain and treat the novel coronavirus.
In late February — before the virus began its rapid spread across the U.S. — a Harvard press release announced that a team of scientists co-led by Harvard Medical School Dean George Q. Daley would collaborate with Chinese researchers on a five-year effort to study the virus.
Specifically, the partners aim to create more accurate diagnostic tests and to design vaccines, antiviral therapies, and treatments. They will share $115 million in funding from China Evergrande Group, a real estate giant and Fortune Global 500 company.
Also in February, the Harvard School of Public Health’s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics shifted its focus almost entirely to coronavirus-related research, launching twenty new projects. School of Public Health epidemiology professor Michael J. Mina, who works at the CCDD, said the center is focused on understanding patterns of transmission in the United States.
“We are also working on understanding which populations might be crucial to transmission, and how different policies that are being enacted are impacting the growth of the epidemic,” Mina said. “Now that we have all the students not being in school and people staying home from work, the major questions are, well, how is this actually working?”
Mina said the center is also developing methods to better ascertain the current state of the epidemic and the impact of various interventions, given a lack of adequate testing domestically.
“We're also developing new technologies and efforts to increase testing capacity,” Mina said.
Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston is currently testing patients for coronavirus. Mina said the Broad Institute, another Harvard-affiliated institution, will begin testing for the virus next week.
Other Harvard affiliates are focusing their efforts on vaccination. Researchers in the Precision Vaccines Program at Harvard-tied Boston Children’s Hospital, for instance, are developing a vaccine specifically targeted toward the group most vulnerable to the virus – the elderly.
Led by PVP Director and Medical School professor Ofer Levy, the researchers are modeling blood samples from elderly individuals outside the body, looking for small molecules called adjuvants. Levy says the molecules work like “rocket fuel,” boosting immune response and activating an elderly immune system.
“We realize that vaccines are not one-size-fits-all, that the response to a vaccine can vary whether the individual is young or elderly, male or female, living in Africa or in the U.S.,” Levy said. “In the context of this coronavirus pandemic, we are moving forward with experiments to build a coronavirus vaccine that's optimized for the elderly.”
In health policy, researchers at the Harvard Global Health Institute launched an interactive tool in coordination with the New York Times and ProPublica to estimate and visualize the increases in hospital capacity that will be needed to meet the demands of the coronavirus outbreak.
School of Public Health health policy professor Thomas C. Tsai called the results of the projection “quite daunting.”
“In many areas — in fact, most areas of the United States — there is a critical shortage of available beds versus anticipated beds and ICUs if we are unable to flatten the curve,” Tsai said.
Tsai said the team is currently studying the availability of ventilators and estimating the potential workforce needed to handle an influx of coronavirus patients.
“Our goal is to get the conversation started,” Tsai said. “Then state and local government leaders, hospital leaders can start the hard work of planning for how we create extra capacity to meet the incoming surge.”

Harvard Business School will extend the deadline for its deferred-admission Master of Business Administration program in light of the escalating coronavirus pandemic, Business School Managing Director of MBA Admissions and Financial Aid Chad I. Losee wrote on the program’s website Wednesday.
Instead of April 2, the deadline for the upcoming application cycle is now June 1 at noon. The school will release decisions on July 28.
Intended for prospective students currently enrolled in full-time undergraduate or master’s degree programs, the 2+2 program entails at least two years of work experience and two years in the standard MBA program. Preference is given to “high potential” students who pursue less traditional paths to business school, according to the Business School website, including individuals who come from lower socioeconomic backgrounds or are pursuing entrepreneurship.
Nine percent of 1,403 total applicants to the program earned spots in the Class of 2023, with 115 matriculating in the 2+2 cohort.
In the post, Losee wrote that the admissions office decided to offer more flexibility in light of severe disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
“We have learned that many of your recommenders are overwhelmed and academic testing centers have closed in many places around the world,” Losee wrote. “In short, we understand that getting your application over the finish line is difficult with everything going on.”
Losee added that his team took the decision seriously and apologized to people for whom this development posed an inconvenience. He wrote that the situation may change, but the deadline is most likely fixed at June 1.
“We hope that these extra two months are helpful to you and allow you to focus on your senior year,” Losee wrote.

In response to the spread of the novel coronavirus, Harvard library locations closed all print services Monday, including borrowing and scan-and-deliver, per an announcement posted to the Harvard Library website by University Librarian Martha J. Whitehead. Still, some remote services and digital resources remain online. With the spring semester starting up again this Monday, here’s what you need to know about using Harvard’s libraries.
All of Harvard’s library locations are closed and largely unstaffed – “only essential employees are working on site,” Harvard Library spokesperson Anna Burgess wrote in an email. That change means any services that require handling physical books and manuscripts held by the libraries are suspended for the moment, including borrowing books, scan-and-deliver, BorrowDirect, and InterLibrary Loan. Research librarians Anna C. Assogba and Fred Burchsted wrote in an email to History concentrators that “this will have a significant impact” on research activities.
Burgess wrote that the libraries will “make determinations based on guidance from the University and public health experts” as to when to re-open library buildings and resume on-campus services.
Still, a small number of scan-and-deliver requests will go through. Assogba and Burchsted wrote that scan-and-deliver links remain open on the Hollis website because roughly 20 percent of requested documents are digitally available.
All digital resources and databases are still available. Additionally, Assogba and Burchsted wrote that “many of the publishers and vendors that provide our online resources are stepping up and offering free or expanded access during this time,” though they noted Harvard is still working out the exact details of these arrangements.
Remote library services, like Ask a Librarian, are also still in place. Burgess wrote that, compared to last spring break, emails this week to Ask a Librarian increased from 92 to 149, while chats nearly quadrupled from 46 to 166. She added that some services typically offered in person — like the Media& group, which assists with video and podcasting — have moved online.
To help researchers, Assogba and Burchsted wrote that they added two new entries to the history guides page on Hollis titled “Working Off Campus” and “Finding Sources Online.”
The University will also fulfill purchase requests for e-books in some cases, Assogba and Burchsted wrote.
“In the meantime,” they wrote, “if you don’t find what you want in HOLLIS, please let us know and we will try some other possibilities.”
Burgess wrote that the libraries are considering how “to modify certain services, like scan-and-deliver, to be available in some capacity while staff work remotely.”
She did not clarify how remote work would affect staff’s ability to fulfill requests related to physical documents in the coming months. The University is also assembling a “Research Remotely” guide that will be posted to its dedicated coronavirus website.
Burgess added that the libraries will move in lockstep with University guidelines more broadly as they consider when to resume regular service.
“Library leadership is in regular contact with University leadership,” she wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School will adopt a mandatory credit-fail grading policy for the Spring 2020 semester in response to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, administrators announced in a Friday email to students.
The email comes as an update to an initial policy change the Law School made on March 16, establishing an optional credit-no credit policy under which students could choose whether to continue with letter grades.
The grading changes in turn followed a March 10 announcement from University President Lawrence S. Bacow that Harvard would move to remote learning for the remainder of the term. In a follow-up email sent the same day, Law School administrators wrote that Law School students living in on-campus housing would be required to vacate campus by March 22.
More than 100 third-year students signed a letter to the administration on Wednesday asking the Law School to discontinue the opt-in policy in favor of mandatory credit-fail. Additionally, the First Class Law Students Association and dozens of other student organizations, such as the Affinity Group Coalition, sent a second letter on Thursday arguing the opt-in policy would discredit the transcripts of disadvantaged students, whose living situations would make it difficult to take classes remotely and force them to choose the credit-fail option.
The Law School acknowledged these letters in its email, but also wrote that other students provided input in favor of the opt-in system.
“We are grateful to the many among you who wrote to us advocating thoughtfully for both the opt-in and mandatory CR/F approaches, among others, and acknowledging the difficulty of the decision our School faces,” the email reads. “If the equities and the concerns you expressed clearly favored one approach, our task would be easier.”
The email explained that the Law School decided to switch to a mandatory credit-fail system because of the unpredictable nature of the coronavirus pandemic, as well as concerns over unexpected challenges to students.
“It has become more apparent by the day how deep, wide, and longstanding the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic might be,” it reads. “Thus, while we all hope for the best, we thought it important to give you the space and flexibility to meet the unknowable challenges that lie ahead – difficulties in securing child care, the risk to friends and family of illness or economic dislocation, and many things we cannot today foresee.”
The Law School also wrote that its decision aims to alleviate pressure on students who were trying to decide by the April 17 deadline whether or not their new living situations would allow them to succeed academically with a letter grading system.
“At this moment, when you have so much to cope with and deal with, we thought it important for you to be devoting your mental and emotional energy to something other than worrying about whether to opt into CR/F for the semester,” the email reads.
The Law School email noted that some students might oppose the mandatory credit-fail policy, since it does not offer the chance to demonstrate improvement over previous grades.
Law School student Juan A. Espinoza — who helped write the Thursday letter to the administration — wrote in an emailed statement that he applauds the Law School’s decision but recognizes the change may disadvantage some students.
“We are pleased that students will not have to worry about competing for letter grades this semester and that they will not have to carry the stress of deciding whether or not to ‘opt in’ atop all of the other issues that so many are struggling with right now,” he wrote. “Still, we're sorry for how this policy might harm those among us who were really counting on academic successes this semester, and we plan to keep pushing the administration to articulate concrete supports for these students.”
In response to that criticism of mandatory pass-fail, some undergraduates have proposed instituting an alternative “Double A” system at the College, under which professors must grant students either an A or an A-minus for this semester. Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar Michael P. Burke announced on March 12 that the College has extended its deadline to change courses’ status to pass-fail to April 13.
The Law School stated in its email that it would work to reduce any detrimental effects of the credit-fail approach, including challenges finding employment or developing relationships with professors.
“We are considering additional summer research assistant opportunities to help 1L students work with and get to know more faculty, and exploring whether it is feasible to move the law firm hiring process to later in the academic year,” the email reads. “We will also do all we can to support our LL.M. students on the job market.”
The Law School assured students it would provide more information on questions related to the grading policy change soon, urging them to take care of themselves and one another throughout the evolving situation the coronavirus outbreak poses.
“We will see you next week on Zoom, and look forward to seeing you all again in person when we can,” it concluded.

A new Harvard School of Public Health initiative will focus on the mental health of healthcare workers addressing the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, according to a Monday press release.
The program — Health and Wellness For All — will begin with an online pilot to address stress and anxiety, which can lead to burnout and attrition among public health professionals, according to the press release.
Thrive Global, a technology startup founded by Arianna S. Huffington, is collaborating with the School of Public Health to develop the content, coaching, and workshops involved in the online pilot program.
“Our global response to this pandemic is dependent on safeguarding the health of those on the front lines of the crisis,” Huffington stated in the press release. “The rest of us can isolate ourselves — our public health workers can’t.”
Participants will complete “Microsteps” geared toward incremental improvements in overall wellbeing, such as a greater focus on relationships and stress management.
Sixteen Massachusetts organizations — including the MGH Institute of Health Professions, the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce, the Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program, and Partners in Health — will pilot the program to a group of healthcare workers.
After the pilot iteration, organizers will distribute a reworked program to academic collaborators, including other School of Public Health affiliates, and eventually to the healthcare workforce at large.
Beginning Wednesday, the School of Public also launched a series of weekly online forums on mental health and coping strategies in the face of the outbreak.
Dean of the School of Public Health Michelle A. Williams stated in the press release that she believes it is paramount to manage the well-being of healthcare workers in light of the coronavirus pandemic.
“As leaders in public health, it is our responsibility to find the solution for how we can better care for our caregivers,” Williams said.
CORRECTION: March 23, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the name of a participating organization in the healthcare workers program. It is the MGH Institute of Health Professions, not the Massachusetts General Hospital Institute for Health Professions.

The City of Cambridge announced Thursday that it would activate the Mayor’s Disaster Relief Fund in order to help residents struggling economically during the coronavirus outbreak.
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui and City Manager Louis A. DePasquale announced in a press release that they would activate the fund, which is soliciting donations, to support Cambridge residents “who are experiencing extreme financial hardship” due to the pandemic.
“The COVID-19 virus has had, and will continue to have, devastating impacts on all our residents, and particularly those who are most vulnerable in our community,” Siddiqui and DePasquale stated in the press release. “We need our entire community, in collaboration with state and federal agencies, to be involved in mitigating and slowing this pandemic.”
The coronavirus — which has forced Harvard undergraduates out of their dorms, postponed the University’s commencement, and prompted Massachusetts Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 to bar on-premise consumption at restaurants and bars — has also shuttered many Cambridge businesses.
The pandemic could result in the loss of around 3 million American jobs by the summer, according to an estimate this week from the Economic Policy Institute.
There have been eight confirmed cases of coronavirus in Cambridge to date. Statewide, there are more than 400 confirmed cases of the disease. Baker confirmed the first coronavirus-related death in the Bay State on Friday.
At least six Harvard affiliates have also tested positive for the virus, though other students told The Crimson they were turned away from health facilities in their area and not given a test, even after showing symptoms of the virus.
The activation of the Mayor’s Disaster Relief Fund is one of several emergency measures aimed at blunting the local impact of the virus. The City of Cambridge and the Cambridge Department of Public Health declared a public health emergency Thursday, a move intended to expedite public health resources. The Massachusetts Department of Health has also awarded the city $100,000 as part of a $5 million grant that Baker issued to state health boards.
The city will partner with nonprofit organizations in order to provide emergency assistance through the fund, according to Thursday’s release.

Thirty-two municipal and state officials sent a letter to Massachusetts Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 Wednesday calling for a “shelter in place” to mitigate the spread of coronavirus. Despite this, Baker said in a press conference Friday that there is currently no plan for a statewide shelter in place.
The letter urged Baker to impose a shelter in place measure similar to the one imposed in the San Francisco Bay Area on March 16.
Massachusetts’s almost seven million residents would be “asked to stay home except for essential needs,” according to the letter. Essential needs may include caring for others, being cared for, or performing vital jobs.
The letter further asked the state to make room for those in need of shelter where “congregate” housing could pose a risk in the face of the highly contagious coronavirus.
State Senator James B. "James" Eldridge, who cosigned the letter, said college dorms and public buildings should be opened up to provide housing with adequate social distance to those in need.
Before Baker’s press conference Friday, Eldridge had predicted the governor would “order a shelter in place in a matter of days.”
The list of signatories is Cambridge-heavy. City Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon, and six other Cambridge City Councilors signed on.
State Representative Mike Connolly, a Cambridge resident who drafted the letter, wrote in an email to constituents Thursday that such a shelter in place measure is essential.
“The sooner we are all able to get everyone who possibly can to stay home, the sooner we can ‘flatten the curve’ on the spread of COVID-19 and begin to get back to normal,” Connolly wrote.
Both Connolly and cosigner City Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan argued that a shelter in place order would need to last at least two weeks. Eldridge said a shelter in place should remain in effect until Massachusetts has “adequate” COVID-19 testing.
Many cosigners shared similar sentiments of hoping to “flatten the curve” and dampen the spread of the virus.
“Most people in Cambridge understand that this is very serious,” City Councilor Marc C. McGovern said.
Connolly called the Baker Administration’s decision not to impose a shelter in place “disappointing.”
“They must not be listening to public health experts,” Connolly said in an interview. “Every hour that goes by means many additional lives could very well be lost in the coming days and weeks.”
When asked for comment, Baker’s director of communications Elizabeth Guyton pointed to Baker’s comments at his press conference.
Baker stated that he based his decision not to pursue a shelter in place advice on medical professionals.
“I’m not going to do it just because somebody else did it,” he said, referring to stay-at-home guidelines put in place in California and New York.
Still, Connolly, in an email to other state legislators, implored colleagues to prioritize aggressive policies to control the outbreak.
“Suppression has to be our main and overriding focus right now,” Connolly wrote. “From there we can figure out all the other details to make this situation workable for the next few weeks at least.”

Amid the surge of candidates put forth by external groups like Harvard Forward, Harvard announced its own eight nominees vying for five anticipated vacancies on the Board of Overseers — the University’s second highest governing body — in late January.
The annual election of members to Harvard’s second-highest governing board has drawn five candidates from Harvard Forward, an alumni group advocating for fossil fuel divestment and the election of younger alumni to governance positions. The five come from a variety of backgrounds, and include a professional soccer player and an Environmental Protection Agency analyst.
Many of the alumni Harvard endorsed, meanwhile, have served in major corporations or in government posts. The list of candidates includes a two-time United States Poet Laureate and the head of sustainable investing at Putnam Investments — a Boston-based management firm.
This year’s election for the Board of Overseers is scheduled to take place from April 1 to May 19. All Harvard alumni are eligible to vote by traditional paper ballot or online for the candidates, except members of the Harvard Corporation and those in University instruction and governance positions.
Meet the candidates the Harvard Alumni Association endorsed for seats on the Board: Raphael W. Bostic ’87, Katherine Collins, David H. Eun ’89, Diego A. Rodriguez, Tracy K. Smith ’94, Miki Uchida Tsusaka ’84, and Ryan M. Wise.
Graduating from Harvard College magna cum laude, Raphael W. Bostic ’87 — a former Cabot House resident — recalled his experience serving as class marshall during the 2012 commencement ceremonies “humbling” and also “a lot of fun.”
Bostic, a former Psychology and Economics concentrator, said serving as class marshall brought him back to the hours he spent in Harvard Yard during his undergraduate days.
In an interview with The Crimson, he said studying Psychology and Economics — fields that he noted respectively teach students how to maximize utility and assume people don’t rationally make decisions — gave him a better understanding of “how the world worked” and is “quite helpful” to his current role.
After obtaining a economics Ph.D. degree from Stanford University in 1995, Bostic now serves as the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta — the first African American and openly gay person to head a Federal Reserve regional bank.
Bostic wrote in his ballot statement that he is running for the Board of Overseers because of Harvard’s potential to further expand the access for people around the world to opportunities and to accelerate “broad societal progress.”
“If we are to be a society where people truly have equal access to opportunity and, in turn, an equal opportunity to achieve and thrive, then we must establish this as a high priority,” he wrote.
Prior to his position at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, he served as the assistant secretary for policy development and research at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Prior to that, Bostic served as a senior economist for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.
Bostic also served as an elected director of the Harvard Alumni Association from 2014 to 2017.
As the head of sustainable investing at Putnam Investments, Katherine A. Collins oversees research and strategy on sustainability issues and manages two public equity portfolios. She graduated from Harvard Divinity School in 2011.
Collins enrolled in the Divinity School nearly 20 years into her career as an investor, hoping to become a better “translator” between sustainability and finance.
“When we were trying to connect issues of sustainability and finance, often, there were sustainability experts on one side of the table, finance experts on the other side, and even when we really wanted to, it was really hard to translate between those two realms” Collins said. “And so I wanted to be a better translator.”
She said she wanted to study at the Divinity School to look beyond the methodologies for sustainability that she was already “deeply engaged” with.
While at the Divinity School, she founded Honeybee Capital — an organization focused on researching sustainability and structuring businesses for charitable giving.
Collins has served on the boards of Last Mile Health, a nonprofit that brings healthcare to rural areas in Africa, and the Santa Fe Institute, a theoretical research center in Santa Fe, N.M. She has also served on the board of the Omega Institute, a nonprofit focused on education in spirituality, and the Wellesley College Business Leadership Council.
“These organizations are trying to reframe conversations,” she said. “I’ve been really intrigued by the way that the specific parts of the mission relate to those broader systems changes and that’s been a big focus of my board work for them.”
Collins said she sees links between her work and contributions she could make as a member of the Board of Overseers.
“One contribution I think that’s really needed in many organizations right now is this translating capacity, being able to go back and forth between different domains of expertise and really frame important questions in their appropriate context,” she said.
David H. “Dave” Eun ’89 said he is running for the Board of Overseers because he has thought deeply about innovation and he wanted to ensure other Harvard students have the same experience he did while studying at Harvard.
Eun currently serves as the chief innovation officer of Samsung Electronics and the president of Samsung NEXT — a group focused on innovation and helping entrepreneurs expand software and services ventures.
Prior to his work with Samsung, Eun held management positions at AOL, Google, Time Warner, and NBC. He was also named a Hollywood Reporter “Digital Power Player of the Year.”
But for Eun, advocating for diversity in education and volunteering were of “personal interest.”
He said he volunteered with the Phillips Brooks House Association during one summer at Harvard, teaching English to Cambodian and Vietnamese teenagers at night after working in the admissions office during the day. As an undergraduate, he also worked with the Undergraduate Minority Recruitment Program and later went on to work as an alumni interviewer in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York.
Now, Eun co-chairs the board of StreetSquash — a program for children in Newark, N.J. and Harlem, N.Y. — and serves on an advisory board for the PACER Center, which aims to support children and young adults with disabilities.
“I’ve always thought about my own journey and having parents who immigrated to this country,” he said. “I’ve always had a particular sensitivity to those who might not feel like they’re part of a majority.”
He said he sees parallels between his roles at Samsung and Harvard’s institutional goals.
“Much of what I do is trying to make sure that I can identify new opportunities for Samsung and the partners that we work with,” he said. “I think that an organization like Harvard must have people who are asking these kind of questions. What’s working well? And what are those kind of traditions that make us who we are that we absolutely want to continue? And what are those things that we have to reexamine? What are those things that we have to change?”
“That’s what I’ve been doing professionally for decades,” he said.
After graduating from Harvard College and writing a thesis on American political theater when arts were still “primarily extracurricular,” Susan M. Novick ’85 wrote that her college years studying “anything and everything” led her to many career ventures.
Following a passion for the arts, Novick graduated to become a talent and literary agent, collaborating actors and writers. She wrote in an email that her years at Harvard made “natural” for her to “fight against stereotyping in casting” and “advocate for diverse representation in the arts.”
A former president of the Harvard Alumni Association and the parent of two College graduates, Novick has spent years helping organize Harvard’s alumni groups. The Long Island, N.Y. native began on HAA’s board of directors in 2007 and then was elected president of the Harvard Club of Long Island in 2012. In 2014, Novick began serving on HAA’s executive committee. She became the organization's vice president in 2016 and its president in 2017.
Novick wrote in her ballot statement that her service to Harvard is inspired by the University’s mission to “educate global leaders who create positive impact.”
“As the parent of two College graduates, I understand the concerns of today’s students, the perspectives of multi-generational alumni around the world, and the opportunity to bridge the two as we chart Harvard’s future together,” she wrote.
Novick wrote that her decision to run for the Board of Overseers stems from her belief in Harvard’s responsibility to lead.
“In a time when many institutions are under attack, it is important that Harvard reaffirms and sustains the educational excellence, diverse community, and interdisciplinary thought leadership that has enabled it to advance the pursuit of truth and effect positive change in the world,” she wrote in her email
In 1999, Diego A. Rodriguez began his Master of Business Administration program at Harvard Business School. Almost two decades after graduating from the Business School, Rodriguez said one of his “greatest joys” is to go back to campus and interact with his professors and current students at the school.
After graduating in 2001, Rodriguez served as an “entrepreneur-in-residence” at an entrepreneurship center at the Business School. He is also an alumni advisor for Harvard’s MS/MBA technology leadership program.
Rodriguez is now the executive vice president and chief product and design officer at Intuit, an American financial software company.
“I've spent my entire career really building new products and services,” Rodriguez said. “As a byproduct of that, I’ve also been heavily invested in helping other people do the same thing.”
Rodriguez received a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering and a multidisciplinary Bachelor of Arts degree at Stanford, which he said gives him a “balance” of engineering and humanities perspectives.
Currently serving a two-year term on the Board of Overseers, Rodriguez serves on several of the board’s committees, including the standing committees on humanities and arts and on institutional policy. He also serves on a visiting committee for the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, which will have a new campus in Allston due to open in the fall.
“I’ve always been passionate about a whole range of disciplines,” he said. “It’s why I’m on the humanities and arts committee and why I'm also on the committee for SEAS. Because I want to be that bridge that helps bring things together”
Rodriguez said he hopes to leverage his specialization in problem solving to make Harvard a better place.
“What I specialize in is problem solving, and bringing people together to discover ways of structuring a problem by asking a better question,” he said.
For two-time U.S. Poet Laureate and Pulitzer Prize Recipient Tracy K. Smith ’94, Harvard’s literary spaces provided her with a home on campus.
At the College, Smith pursued a joint concentration in English and African and African American studies. She focused on poetry in particular, taking four poetry workshops during her last two years as an undergraduate. In addition to contributing to The Crimson and the Advocate, a campus literary magazine, she became involved with the Dark Room Collective — a group focused on providing a space for black writers to share their work.
“It was really the literary community within the Creative Writing Program and then the Dark Room that gave me a sense of belonging to the University,” she said. “It was made up of young people who were writing poetry and fiction and who felt like they wanted to find ways of connecting with the people we considered to be our literary heroes or forebears.”
Following her graduation from Harvard in 1994, she said she immediately went home to California to live with her mother, who had been diagnosed with cancer.
“Reading and writing poems was one way of managing the anxiety and also the grief that I was dealing with,” she said. “That galvanized me to think about really committing to poetry.”
After her mother passed away, she completed Columbia University’s Master of Fine Arts program in poetry and a Stegner Fellowship at Stanford, which brings together ten artists — five in fiction and five in poetry — to work on their creative writing.
After publishing her first book in 2003, she taught at the University of Pittsburgh before moving to Princeton University, which she described as her “professional home.”
Since she published her second book in 2007, she continues to publish poetry and edit. She became the U.S. Poet Laureate for her first term in 2017.
“You just one day get a phone call from the Librarian of Congress asking if you would like to serve in this position,” she said. “Having been really tuned into the laureateship since my time at Columbia, I was very excited and honored.”
After her laureateship, she said she decided to travel to rural areas and talk about poems as a way of connecting with one another.
“One of the motivations that I had in wanting to take on a project like that had to do with the sense of division that has been characterizing American society for the last several years,” she said. “I feel like the internet and polarized politics have made it so that we are often talking at and about one another without quite listening and I know that poems force us into a different stance, which isn’t debate or even argument, so much as receptive alertness.”
She said her current role at Princeton and serving as the 22nd poet laureate led her to think about how to help students and “create a vibrant, diverse, healthy, and proactive community.”
“I think that my perspective is useful to the work that the Board of Overseers is doing because of those values,” Smith said.
After entering Harvard College, Miki Uchida Tsusaka ’84 concentrated in both Government and East Asian Studies because she hoped to work abroad.
Traveling between continents and cities was not an unfamiliar notion for the then-College-aged Tsusaka.
“I was born in Japan, raised back and forth between New York and Tokyo every four or five years of my life,” she said.
During her time at the College, Tsusaka wanted to work in international nonprofit organizations. As her graduation date neared, she wrote to many professors and professionals in Japan for advice on how to obtain a Master’s degree in the country. These conversations changed her future path.
“They all said, ‘You know, looking at your profile, Miki, I wonder if this pace will be fast enough for you,’” Tsusaka recalled. One of the professors she reached out to introduced her to the world of management consulting. Tsusaka eventually started to work for the Boston Consulting Group, where she served as its executive committee member, chief marketing officer, and now serves as the firm’s chief alumni officer.
Tsusaka is a founding member of the World Assembly for Women — an initiative of Japan’s prime minister — and has spoken at the World Economic Forum. She is also a member of the National University Assessment Committee for Japan’s Ministry of Education.
In her time in the College, Tsusaka served as the third president of the Japanese Cultural Society. She said her predecessor in the organization became her husband, and the next president became the current empress of Japan.
"I am forever grateful to Harvard for providing me an extraordinary educational foundation. Harvard taught me the fundamentals of speaking and listening. I would be honored to help make Harvard even better for generations to come as a unique place of learning and giving, and to ensure that the right questions are asked and firmly addressed," she wrote in her ballot statement.
Ryan M. Wise began his career as an educator in a high school classroom. Now, he currently serves as the director of Iowa Department of Education, overseeing Iowa’s public school districts, educator preparation programs, and community colleges.
He will take over as dean of Drake University’s School of Education in May.
“My career is really grounded in my experience as a teacher, teaching for five years in both rural Mississippi and then in downtown Omaha, Nebraska,” he said. “From that first day in the classroom on, I’ve been committed to ensuring all students have the opportunity for excellent learning experiences.”
After his experience in the classroom, he served as the executive director of Teach for America in South Dakota. Wise was also one of the founding members of Teach for All, a network independent and local organizations working to end inequality in education.
Though he graduated from Harvard’s Graduate School of Education in 2013, Wise said the lessons he learned at the school continue to influence his work today.
“The Harvard Graduate School of Education has a foundational commitment to equity, to really ensuring that we are working collectively as an education system to erase the pernicious opportunity gaps that exist for too many students across the country,” he said. “That was really impactful for me.”
Wise said his career is directly applicable to service on the Board of Overseers.
“We are, as a state agency, really all about providing leadership and support to creating a stronger system of education, and in so many ways, that’s what we’re doing as a Board,” he said. “We’re providing advice and counsel and insight to the University and to its leadership as they continue to strengthen Harvard’s mission.”
He said he ran for the Board of Overseers because it was an opportunity to give back to the University. Wise was elected to serve a one-year term on the Board of Overseers in 2019.
“As a relatively recent alum, I feel like I’ve still got a very fresh perspective and, as I mentioned, with the direct ties to what I do every day, I thought that this would be a good way for me to contribute,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay wrote in an email to FAS tenure-track faculty Thursday that Harvard will offer many of them the option to extend their current appointments and postpone their promotion reviews by up to a year in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic.
Tenure-track faculty whose promotion reviews are scheduled for the fall of 2020 or later may opt to extend their contract and postpone their promotion review by one year.
Extensions granted to tenure-track faculty whose promotion reviews were scheduled for the 2019-2020 academic year differ by position.
Specifically, associate professors whose reviews for promotion to tenured professors were scheduled for this spring may choose to extend their contract and postpone their promotion review by one semester. Assistant professors whose reviews for promotion to associate professor were scheduled for this academic year may not extend their review, but may extend their appointments as associate professors by one year if promoted.
“We are offering these options because we recognize that the coronavirus has significantly disrupted academic and personal life, including the transition to remote teaching, the ramping-down of research laboratories, the closure of K-12 schools in Massachusetts, changes in childcare arrangements, and restrictions on travel,” Gay wrote in her email to faculty. “I know that these circumstances have an impact on your time and productivity in doing research, building your teaching portfolio, developing your roles as advisors, mentors, and Harvard citizens, and otherwise advancing your professional careers.”
The FAS tenure track usually spans eight years. In a typical case, FAS hires a tenure-track faculty member as an assistant professor and reviews the faculty member for promotion during the fourth year of their appointment. If they win promotion to the rank of associate professor, FAS will appoint the faculty member for an additional four years and review the faculty member for promotion to tenured professor during their seventh year in Cambridge.
The coronavirus-prompted extensions to tenure clocks come during a year of scrutiny toward Harvard’s tenure processes more broadly. Gay is currently preparing to review the FAS tenure promotion process beginning in the fall of 2020. She announced her plan to do so in a December email to faculty — just a few days after more than 100 faculty members called for such a review.
Asked about the review, Gay said in a March 9 interview she hopes to compare the length of Harvard’s tenure process to that of its peer institutions, among other metrics.
