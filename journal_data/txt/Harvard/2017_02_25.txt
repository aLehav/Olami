After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Disclaimer: This brave reviewer made an attempt to play the opening 30 minutes of “Resident Evil 7” after several glasses of wine and an indeterminate number of shots.
He confidently dove into this treacherous bayou simulator, because the Deep South must be this terrible for anyone who has never been there. He boldly challenged the television screen to “come at me, bro” and dared his own avatar’s rendered shadow to “cash me outside.” All taunts came to a standstill, however, upon the first sighting of a hillbilly non-player character (NPC), walking with an eerily slow gait off-screen until he disappeared into seemingly thin air, as if possessed by the devil. Ahah! The classic bait-and-switch. “The oldest trick in the book,” our reviewer reassured himself as he continued into a blatantly foreboding haunted house. There, he found his impressionable, inebriated self victim to images of rotting intestines, bloodied family photos, and an actual possessed woman chasing him down the hallway with a chainsaw. Slightly nauseated, the reviewer proceeded to shut off the game and vomit in his toilet four times. He remembers everything to this day. Some say the video game was so horrifying that he needed to expel the evil spirits he witnessed out of his psyche. His roommates say it was obviously a result of bad decisions and overdrinking. We will never know for sure. Alas, he lived to tell the tale, and continued to live a normal, adjusted life in Kirkland House afterwards, and recovered enough to complete the entire game sober.
My drunk experience is a testament to how “Resident Evil 7,” in its broader moments, can shock and thrill. Yet, playing through its nine-hour campaign with a discerning, sober eye made for a thoroughly tense experience. The risky creative decisions Capcom made to revitalize its struggling franchise all boil down to the shift from the third- to first-person perspective, resulting in a fundamentally different game from its predecessors—one that succeeds in catching up to modern standards where past games have failed.
Players control Ethan, who journeys deep into the American South to search for his missing wife, Mia. Hopeful and terribly naive, he willingly enters a decrepit, downtrodden plantation house in the middle of a bayou, full of indications of death and decay, without any assistance or regard to common sense. Of course, nothing can come between a man and his wife. There, he is captured by the Baker family who have seized control of Mia through a fungus that turns people into superpowered, invincible pseudo-zombies. Ethan must find a way to cure Mia and escape the clutches of the sadistic and warped Baker family as he explores their estate and uncovers the mystery behind their tragic fates.
The Bakers themselves, Jack, Marguerite, and Lucas, speak in thick Southern accents. As antagonists, they are the source of the game’s many successful sections in which you must adjust to fighting and outsmarting their AI through quick sleight of hand and nimble, stealthy steps. With different behaviors and tools of destruction, from Jack’s rake to Marguerite’s pesky bugs, they proved continually inventive, frightening, and surprising whenever encountered. Interestingly, this wacky interpretation of the hillbilly may reflect just how Capcom and its designers view us Americans: dirty, violent, but ultimately sympathetic, in an almost condescending view of how tragedy befalls the simple-minded. These monsters we face are “scary” not because of how grotesque they are, but because of how eerily human they remain while possessed by an unspecified evil and darkness that pales their skin, bulges their veins, and blackens their eyes. These are the most compelling enemies “Resident Evil” has had in recent memory. They leave you feeling powerless, but not hopeless, and capable, but not optimistic, in your attempts to overcome them. Whether in sneaking around the patrols of Marguerite or solving Lucas’ maniacal torture chambers ripped out of “Saw,” the player will be left on edge, desperately hoping to escape their presence as they explore their not-so-homely abode.
Capcom has resolved to please loyal fans by structurally returning to the seminal game that started it all: “Resident Evil” (sans number). We once again find ourselves stranded in a unrealistic mansion full of trap doors, absurdly complicated puzzles, and medicinally revolutionary herbs. This time around, however, the boxes of ammo and guns littered throughout various nooks, crannies, and shelves are narratively justified by the intention to capture an essence of Southern America. The “Resident Evil” franchise has always indulged itself in its own silly idiosyncrasies that have become, at this point, obligations of legacy.
The most pivotal tradition of this survival horror series is its use of the third-person perspective, which moved from fixed, omniscient angles, to a controllable, over-the-shoulder camera in the simultaneously action-packed and tense “Resident Evil 4.” This revelation only signaled the beginning of the end of this beloved franchise, spawning two installments that struggled to modernize themselves by modeling third-person action games such as “Gears of War.” They quickly lost themselves in B-movie spectacles full of explosions and writhing, behemoth monsters that were more laughable than intimidating. Consequently, the series’ tradition of stiff, tanky characters mixed with high-octane action never truly worked. In “Resident Evil 7,” Director Koshi Nakanishi strips away spectacle and returns to subtle, quiet horror that is refreshing, and long overdue.
Controversial statement though it may be, horror seems to belong in the first-person, as indicated by players and the industry. From “Amnesia: The Dark Descent,” to the phenomenon “Slender,” and the recent “Alien: Isolation,” both independent and large studios have discovered the practicality of generating tension while occupying the claustrophobic and limited head-space of the first-person perspective. Its merits are obvious. By obscuring surroundings and severely limiting their sense of control, the first-person perspective plunges players into what is arguably a more immersive and vulnerable position in the game world. Unlike in the third-person, the player can no longer find comfort in a visual comprehension of the game environment, so threats can be suggested almost in every dark corner by audiovisual cues. Here, the mere horror of suggestion—the implied presence—sends shivers down your spine. I found myself shocked at the sight of my own shadow upon walking in front of a bright light source, and constantly jerking at the sound of my avatar’s own footsteps on the creaking wooden floor. Harsh dissonance and silence play equally important roles in generating an atmosphere of perpetual unease. The scariest moments of the game can stem not only from the explicit appearance of enemies but also from their implied presence, in which the looming shadows in the distance could be either a hallucination or, God forbid, a real threat. Those damn decapitated mannequins, for example, find a way to pop in at every inconvenient moment.
At the core of horror is the defamiliarization of a space that you felt was once safe and known. It is alien. Dark. You do not know what might be around the corner until you check it yourself. In film, the camera guides viewers through the space. This game forces players to check what’s under the bed on their own volition. “Resident Evil 7” plays like “Gone Home” if your suspicions of danger were actually true. The house itself is your enemy, a maze you must traverse and a puzzle you must crack to find relief in the nearest safe space you can find. Backtracking, in which the player is forced to retrace their steps to previously explored areas that may no longer be safe, is another well-tread series tradition that is used to extensive effect. “Resident Evil 7” formally returns to its concern with how details from the smallest creak in the distance to the door closing magically behind you can generate more tension than the writhing masses of goo-monsters of the series’ past two installments.
Ethan, similar to past installments’ characters, moves and aims guns with a sloppy weight and stiffness, continually resisting the player’s need for precision. The designers implement subtle mechanics in nearly every aspect of gameplay to make the player feel bound to external forces, never having full control of the situation. This design philosophy is exemplified in the scarcity of weapon ammo so that running away may be the only option, or in the invincibility of certain enemies, so that running away is, yet again, the only option. This crucial feeling of powerlessness, of feeling incapable of overcoming every obstacle through brute force, is a design philosophy antithetical to the majority of modern games outside horror, and it is what carries this game’s first six hours to success.
At the six-hour mark, “Resident Evil 7” encounters the trademark fatal flaw to any horror experience. Pacing is a pivotal element that is criminally overlooked, particularly in an industry that feels an obligation to justify its asking price by investing in the quantity of game rather than its quality. Horror games are often overlong, and can repeat and recycle encounters to extend game time. “Alien: Isolation,” an otherwise spectacularly produced horror game, was stretched to a maddening length at 15 hours, which is about twice as long as it should have been. The inherent problem is that the longer the game runs, the more predictable scenarios and enemies become and the more player unease becomes annoying, rather than entertaining. The more time you spend in this game, the more you realize that this environment and world that was once scary is actually a sadistic obstacle course. The artifice becomes blatant, and the charm wears off. “Resident Evil 7,” after having taken two steps forward, takes another step back in its final acts by throwing waves of walking black goo-monsters that are only scary because you fear having to use precious bullets to kill them. The game regresses back into its roots of action gun-toting gameplay—it betrays the strong adventure-game core it spent so much time meticulously developing in its opening acts through wonderfully eerie environmental horror.
It is disappointing that a game so delightfully scary in its first two thirds should end in dull, grating action. You can blame the developer’s burden to satisfy an action-hungry audience by giving them B-movie horror spectacles in the form of writing monsters with several glowing weak points to shoot bullets into. Yet, that is the reality. The good, but unscary “Resident Evil 5” and atrocity that was “Resident Evil 6” were some of the bestselling games in the series—in spite of mediocre reception. “Resident Evil 7” will not come close to their numbers.
I cannot truly claim that “Resident Evil” has come back into its own with this game, but it has certainly made a firm decision about its creative direction, at the cost of broad, mainstream appeal. The series’ disproportionate obsession with the absurdly grotesque, of writhing black goo, perhaps represents a creative drought that pales to the creative monster design that can otherwise be seen in “The Evil Within,” the truer-to-form spiritual successor of “Resident Evil” from series alum Shinji Mikami. It is unclear where this obsession with black goo stems from, unless it is commentary on the corruptive nature of oil on both the environment and the economy, both of which are represented in the thorough decay in the poverty-stricken bayou rendered here.
This is not so much groundbreaking survival horror as it is an incredibly satisfying refinement of modern horror principles. It has the advantage of learning from lessons that other horror series has refined up to this point. Still, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and, based on where the series stood a few years ago, “Resident Evil 7” is an excellent and necessary step onto the correct path.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A 15-4 run immediately following halftime propelled the Harvard men’s basketball team to a 77-64 win over Yale on Friday night at Lavietes Pavilion. The victory guaranteed the Crimson a top two seed in next month’s inaugural Ivy League Basketball Tournament. Freshmen Bryce Aiken and Seth Towns and senior center Zena Edosomwan led the Crimson (17-7, 9-2 Ivy League) to a 46-point second half. The season sweep over the Bulldogs (14-10, 6-5) was Harvard’s first since the 2012-2013 campaign.
Trailing by three at intermission, the Crimson got an easy layup for freshman wing Justin Bassey to start the second half and was off and running from there. The team was taking and making open shots to begin the second frame, a major shift from the fashion in which it ended the first half.
Less than two minutes after the break, freshman forward Chris Lewis found a cutting Towns for a layup and the latter picked up a steal on the other end that he slammed home for two. After Towns drained a three, a three-point halftime deficit was now a four-point Harvard advantage entering the second period’s first media timeout. The onslaught continued and the lead grew with the Columbus, Ohio native running the show. The freshman scored or assisted on 11 of the Crimson’s 15 points during the run that would prove to be the difference for Harvard.
The spark from Towns was a much-needed one for the Crimson following the break. Despite a hot start, Harvard entered intermission having coughed up an eight-point lead it held early in the first half. The Crimson went 6:47 without a point in the middle of the first frame.
“I was especially impressed with our initial start,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I thought that really gave us some energy and certainly they battled back and were up by a possession at the half. I thought our second half with our poise, at various points to push up and get a lead, made a big difference.”
To make matters worse, the Crimson was getting killed on the glass. Yale outrebounded Harvard 24-11 before the break, including a 7-0 mark in offensive boards. Despite the big discrepancy, Amaker stuck to his guns. With the starting five he has used for the third contest in a row—Aiken, Bassey, Towns, Lewis, and co-captain Siyani Chambers—on the floor, the Crimson was able to find holes in the Yale defense and hold the Bulldogs to jump shots and one-shot possessions to begin the half. After making 13 of its 29 field goal attempts before the break, the Bullodgs hit just 10 of their final 28. Harvard meanwhile made two-thirds of its second half field goals while inducing 17 Yale turnovers on the evening.
If Towns got the second half party going, Aiken closed it out. The Randolph, N.J. native had 14 second half points on 4-of-7 shooting, including a highlight reel crossover that led to a wide-open three and brought the sellout crowd to its feet. The freshman did the same thing less than four minutes later to push the lead to 15.
“I think I was just thinking too much [in the first half],” Aiken said. “I was just second-guessing what I was doing, when to pass, when to shoot. When we came out for the second half, I just trusted my instincts and went with it.”
For the second time this season, sophomore guard Alex Copeland was the catalyst for the Bulldogs. Coming off the bench for Yale coach James Jones, the Los Angeles native teamed up with senior forward Sam Downey for 20 of the Bulldogs’ 34 points. The duo shot 8-of-14 from the field while the rest of the team was 5-of-15. As the Crimson forced Yale into more jump shots, Downey became less of a factor and Copeland was the only reliable scoring option for Yale. No other Bulldog scored in double figures after the break and the team’s inability to consistently make jump shots doomed it on the offensive end. In his two contests against Harvard this season, Copeland has scored 20 points in each game.
“He can create a lot,” Amaker said. “He’s very crafty and dynamic with the ball and his shotmaking ability changes it because of his size. He’s a hard guard in terms of how you rush out on him with his ball skills and craftiness to get by and make a play. He can be a dynamic offensive player and certainly we’ve seen that throughout his first year.”
For the third game in a row, the Crimson came out of the gate strong. Harvard hit four of its first five shots to begin the game. All but two of the Crimson’s field goals attempts before the game’s first media timeout were layups but Harvard stopped attacking the rim as the half progressed.
After drawing four Yale fouls in the game’s first four-plus minutes, the Crimson did not get to the line in the first half’s final 15:53 as the Bulldogs committed only one foul in that span. Despite the long stretch without a field goal—something that has become a Harvard tradition this season—the Crimson was able to stay in the game due to sloppy play by Yale. The Bulldogs turned the ball over ten times in the first half and its largest lead of the evening was only six.
Despite only having six players score and having its two bigs in foul trouble during the second half, Harvard was able to keep Yale at arm’s length after cutting the deficit to single digits with 2:10 to play.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the two games the Harvard and Yale men’s basketball teams have played against each other this season, they’ve played in front of sold out crowds. Two weeks ago, it was the Payne Whitney Gym in New Haven. This time, it was Lavietes Pavilion. The first time around, the home crowd was silenced as the Crimson defeated the Elis on the road, 75-67. But at Lavietes, it was the home fans who stayed on their feet and got to tell Yale to “warm up the bus” as the seconds ticked off the clock.
In front of 2,195 fans donning Crimson and waving Zena Edosomwan fat heads, Harvard (17-7, 9-2 Ivy League) defeated Yale (14-10, 6-5), 77-64. The home team was led by freshmen guard Bryce Aiken and Seth Towns, who had 22 and 18 points, respectively.
BATTLING FOR THE BOARDS
When talking X’s and O’s, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker’s main goal against Yale was to be competitive on the glass. Bulldogs’ forward Sam Downey is second in the Ancient Eight in rebounds per game and was able to exploit Harvard’s frontcourt during the first half of the first iteration of the HY rivalry this season.
In the first half, it appeared Amaker’s goal of winning the rebounding game would fall short, as the visitors outrebounded the Crimson, 24-11, including seven offensive boards compared to Harvard’s zero. Despite struggling to keep the Elis off the offensive glass, Yale struggled to convert on its opportunities, as it had just nine second-chance points off of 12 total offensive rebounds.
That turned around in the second half, as the Crimson outrebounded Yale, 21-13 coming out of the locker room.
“I think in the second we did a better job of defending second chance shots and getting rebounds,” senior forward Zena Edosomwan said. “It’s just important as bigs to get inside. We didn’t do a good job earlier, but it got better as the game went on.”
Towns led the Crimson with eight rebounds, while freshmen Justin Bassey and Chris Lewis had six apiece.
TOMMY AMAKER’S FAVORITE WORD
When meeting with the press earlier this week, Amaker referred to balance as “one of my favorite words,” and it appears that his extensive emphasis on the subject came through on Friday night.
On Friday, that balance came through on both ends of the floor.
“I mean you look at our numbers and the balance we talk about trying to get,” Amaker said. “I thought we had tremendous balance and a great effort by everybody to put us in a position to get a victory here tonight and set us up something tomorrow and to close out our season here at home and our senior evening.”
Offensively, Harvard had three players in double-digits, with Aiken (22 points), Towns (18), and Edosomwan (15). The scoring was efficient, with the team connecting on 55.4 percent of its field goals, including 66.7 percent in the second frame. Harvard was taking high probability shots, with Edosomwan scoring on dunks and open layups created by Eli doubling up defenders, leaving space for Edosomwan. Several of Aiken’s buckets came without a hand in his face, as the rookie showed off his immense ball-handling skills, sending Yale freshman Miye Oni to the ground with an ankle-breaking crossover behind the arc.
While sophomore guard Corey Johnson played limited minutes after missing both of last weekend’s games with an illness, the combined hot hands of Aiken and Towns relieved the pressure of Johnson to be a scoring presence.
On defense, the Crimson neutralized Oni for much of the night and limiting the efficiency of the frontcourt duo of Downey and Blake Reynolds, who combined for 25 points on 9-of-24 shooting. Freshman guard Justin Bassey was tasked with guarding Oni for much of the night as the 6’6’’ Oni tends to create a size mismatch for most defenders.
“I do think that we switched a little bit in terms of not giving [Oni] lanes in terms of driving it on the ball screen action,” Amaker said. “I think he missed some shots he would ordinarily make... He’s a tremendous player, tremendous offensive player but certainly we were able to contest some shots and make it difficult.”
Six different Harvard players also recorded steals, four of whom had multiple takeaways, with Aiken leading the way with three.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One year after Clarkson swept the Harvard men’s hockey team in the schools’ two-game season series, the Crimson set the record straight Friday night with its second win of the season over the Green and Gold—a 4-1 triumph at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center. No. 3 Harvard (21-5-2, 15-4-2 ECAC) remains unbeaten at home this season, improving to 10-0-2 at the expense of the Golden Knights (14-14-5, 9-9-3).
“It was a good, solid game,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I think Clarkson is a good hockey team: well-coached, big, physical down low, good goalie. So we prepared for a game that was going to be tight and heavy.”
Six minutes into the middle period, Harvard senior blue-liner Clay Anderson fired a 70-foot shot to the front of the net, where it ricocheted ambiguously off a leg before trickling through freshman netminder Jake Kielly’s pads. Senior Phil Zielonka was initially awarded the goal before it was formally credited to Anderson who, with a bit of puck luck, notched his third tally of the season. The blue-liner’s goal proved to be the game-winner in what amounted to the Crimson’s ninth consecutive victory.
“[Anderson] made a good play to keep [the puck] in the zone,” said Donato of the winning tally. “It looked like it got deflected, I’m not sure if [Zielonka] got a piece of it…but obviously a big goal there.”
Co-captain Alexander Kerfoot cracked open the scoresheet just over four minutes into the first period, burying a Lewis Zerter-Gossage feed for his 13th goal of the season. Flying into the zone on the rush, the sophomore threaded a saucer pass from the right faceoff circle into the slot, where it landed perfectly on Kerfoot’s tape.
Harvard availed itself of quick neutral zone regroups early in the first, peppering the Golden Knights' blue-liners with rush after rush. Eventually, Kielly caved under this short burst of offensive zone pressure.
“We just wanted to make sure that we were putting pucks behind [the Golden Knights] and using our speed,” Donato said. “They have some big, strong defensemen, and we wanted to win some foot races…. Great finish by Alexander Kerfoot.”
Senior forward Luke Esposito was up to his recent tricks on Friday night, as he once again tallied a man-down strike, putting the Crimson up 3-0. Winning a foot race against Clarkson defenseman Shane Kuzmeski, Esposito threw a shorthanded puck past Kielly’s right pad while falling to one knee just 1:13 into the third. The Greenwich, Conn., native’s third 4-on-5 goal of the month put the game out of reach and gave Harvard its 11th shorthanded conversion of the season—the highest mark in the country.
“We’ve been working hard now on our PK and with the forwards,” Esposito said. “With the talent we have killing and the speed we have up front, we’ve just been looking to push the pace and get up ice and disrupt any way we can.”
Having conceded the opening goal of Friday night’s game, Clarkson falls to 4-7-2 when its opponent strikes first. Once the Golden Knights allowed Kerfoot to connect on his first-period punch-in, the odds were stacked against them; Clarkson is now 2-6-0 when trailing after 20 minutes and remains winless at 0-8-1 when the opposition enters the final period with the lead.
A hooking infraction against Zielonka 5:16 into the contest gave the Golden Knights their first man-up opportunity of the evening. But despite being undermanned, Harvard set the pace, trading chances with Clarkson and testing Kielly multiple times. The visitors’ difficulty cracking the Crimson shorthanded unit was indicative of their recent struggles with the man advantage. After finding twine from the man-up in their first seven games of 2017, the Golden Knights have gone six straight games without a power-play conversion, failing on all 22 attempts.

Before a rebound sent top shelf by Clarkson’s Terrance Amorosa broke junior goalie Merrick Madsen’s perfect night, Harvard was set to complete its second straight clean sheet, following last week’s shutout over Brown. It would have been the first time since 2007 in which Harvard blanked two consecutive opponents.
“I’ve been feeling good,” Madsen noted. “It makes it really easy to play when we have guys up front that are scoring in the first five minutes of the game. It just makes my job a lot easier.”
Madsen is playing his best hockey at the right time for the Crimson. Over the course of Harvard’s 11-game unbeaten streak, the Philadelphia Flyers prospect owns a 1.49 goals against average and a .942 save percentage.
Yet despite not having lost in more than a month, the Crimson is still vying for its first Cleary Cup—given to the regular-season ECAC champion—since 1994. The win over Clarkson was not enough to put the Crimson ahead of Union, who sits atop the ECAC with 33 points.
While Harvard was sealing the deal against the Golden Knights on Friday, the Dutchmen were digging themselves out of a late-game deficit that ultimately turned into an overtime victory against Colgate. The recipient of the Cleary Cup, therefore, won’t be declared until Saturday night, when the Crimson hosts St. Lawrence and Union entertains Cornell in the teams’ respective regular-season finales.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Beating Cornell’s men’s hockey team at Lynah Rink is no easy task. Showered with seafood or not, guests of the Big Red have emerged victorious from the arena only 30 percent of the time throughout its 60 years of existence.
Nonetheless, nine of the ECAC’s last 10 regular-season champions have all picked up two points on their trips to Ithaca, New York. And based on how things have shaped up in 2017, there’s a considerable chance that trend continues.
Tonight, No. 7 Union (23-8-2, 16-4-1 ECAC) will pay its annual visit to Lynah—this time on the final day of the ECAC regular season—knowing that a victory inside the home of No. 9 Cornell (18-6-4, 13-4-4) would wrap up its fourth regular-season crown in the last seven years.
A tie or a loss, on the other hand, would leave the door wide open for a team that took care of business in Ithaca just last month—Harvard. More than 300 miles to the east, the No. 3 Crimson (21-5-2, 15-4-2) will take on No. 20 St. Lawrence (16-10-7, 12-5-4) tonight at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center, needing a win of its own to have a chance at capturing its third major trophy of the season.
Last week, Harvard put in its first two claims on hardware, winning the Beanpot championship for the first time in 24 seasons and the outright Ivy League title for the first time in 11. This time in front of a home crowd, the Crimson will aim to grab the Cleary Cup—named in honor of Harvard Hockey legend Bill Cleary ’56—for the first time in 23 seasons.
Tonight will also be the night where the Crimson honors its eight seniors, who represent the highest-scoring veteran class (151 points) in all of college hockey. But even with post-game festivities in store, Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 is focused on the task at hand.
“I don’t think there’s a lot of time to really digest it all and have a great perspective,” Donato said. “I think we’re pretty focused on going out to try to get two points tomorrow and give ourselves a chance to win the regular season title.”
Currently one point behind Union (33 points), the Crimson (32 points) must win and receive help from Ivy League rival Cornell to capture the championship. A Harvard win and a Union loss would give the Crimson the ECAC title outright. Meanwhile, a Harvard win paired with a draw at Lynah would mean the Crimson would share the crown with the Dutchmen. But thanks to a tiebreaker, Harvard would earn the top seed in the conference tournament.
The Crimson nearly gained control of its own destiny Friday night when 10th-place Colgate gave Union a serious run for its money in Hamilton, New York. The Raiders scored twice in a row early in the third period to take a 3-2 lead over the Dutchmen, but Union’s Mike Vecchione—a legitimate contender for the Hobey Baker award—assisted on a late equalizer and netted an overtime winner to keep the Dutchmen in the driver’s seat.
Of course, Harvard never realized how close the inside track to the trophy truly became because the Crimson was simultaneously engaged in its own contest against Clarkson, which it won by a 4-1 margin. When asked how long it typically takes to start checking scores upon reaching the locker room, senior Luke Esposito provided a candid answer.
“Normally not that quick,” said Esposito, beginning to break into a grin. “But on nights like tonight, pretty quick.”
Despite not reading off the score he was hoping for, however, Esposito and the Crimson know that tonight’s a new night.
“Hopefully we get a little help from the Big Red,” Esposito concluded.
