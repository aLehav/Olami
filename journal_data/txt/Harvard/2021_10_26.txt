After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“They’re saying time travel is possible now.”
So begins the first substantive exchange between husband and wife Ingvar (Hilmir Snær Guðnason) and Maria (Noomi Rapace) in the A24 horror film “Lamb,” directed by Valdimar Jóhannsson. In a story that examines how we cope with loss, this conversation is a thought provoking and fitting way to start the film. The central characters are grieving, and though it goes unsaid, they undoubtedly wish they could go back to a time before their loss irrevocably changed their lives. “Lamb” follows the couple as they take in a human-lamb hybrid to raise as their own child. The narrative slowly unfolds into an unsettling, often bizarre exploration of grief and the fraught relationship between humans and nature. While compelling in its concept and technically impressive in its filmmaking, “Lamb” ultimately leaves viewers more baffled than contemplative due to a screenplay that leaves far too much terrain unexplored.
The film is divided into three chapters, the first of which shows Ingvar and Maria listlessly completing mundane tasks on their farm in the isolated Icelandic countryside. Heavy silence fills the air as static shots linger on them tagging sheep or doing household chores. An unspoken sadness is palpable, and though this exposition is lacking in excitement, it effectively conveys their stilted relationship with grace and subtlety.
Not long into the film, their quiet heartbreak gives way to unbridled joy when a sheep on their farm gives birth to a very unique lamb. Ingvar takes a crib out of storage and sets it up next to their bed; Maria tenderly cradles and feeds the baby, singing her lullabies. One might initially assume that the film is straying into the genre of psychological horror: perhaps Ingvar and Maria are projecting human characteristics onto a normal lamb because they want so badly to have a baby. But the anthropomorphic lamb — they name her Ada — is no figment of their imagination. She is revealed to be bipedal with arms, legs, and a lamb’s head; she can understand them, but can’t speak. The main tension of the film comes from the fact that Ada’s biological sheep mother wants to get her back from Ingvar and Maria.
“Lamb” is a bewildering and often jarring portrayal of an unconventional family; it’s quite the mental hurdle to take them seriously, and viewers might even be compelled to laugh at some of the couple’s interactions with their new daughter, whom they clothe and treat like a human. What makes her presence more uncomfortable than intriguing is the fact that the script fails to give us enough information on Ingvar, Maria, and Ada. The death they’re grieving is only fleetingly acknowledged, and we never learn anything more about their past. They communicate almost exclusively in cryptic sentences. When Ingvar’s brother Petur (Björn Hlynur Haraldsson) comes to stay with them and demands to know what’s going on, Ingvar simply replies with: “Happiness.” Throughout the film, Jóhannsson frequently centers the camera on the backs of his protagonists, their expressions obscured from viewers. Perhaps he is trying to communicate more by saying less, but ultimately this approach just makes it harder to sympathize with the couple.
While the story isn’t always easily believable, the film is consistently remarkable in its aesthetics. Carefully framed, intimate shots of the family at home are interspersed with sweeping wide shots of rural Iceland. Although the weather is perpetually bleak, the countryside is breathtaking: Snow capped mountains are situated in the distance, a picturesque stream bubbles loudly nearby, and a thick, omnipresent layer of mist enigmatically shrouds the entire area. The sinister beauty of the setting is perfect for a horror film, but despite its categorization as such, “Lamb” never truly instills fear in its audiences. Sure, it’s sometimes eerie with Jóhannssons’s use of painstakingly slow zoom-in shots, or the drone-like score that seems to indicate an unknown presence looming nearby. But the film is more of a supernatural family drama than anything else, set against the backdrop of the mundanities of everyday farm life.
For the most part, nothing too thrilling happens in “Lamb” after Ada is adopted. The arrival of Petur, the black sheep of the family (no pun intended), allows us to learn a bit more about Ingvar and Maria, but not enough to feel like we really understand them. However, the dynamics between these three family members feel authentic thanks to the natural rapport they have with each other. (A scene where they all dance to a VHS tape of an 80s-style music video that Petur made in his youth is especially memorable.) Moreover, Noomi Rapace stands out with her portrayal of Maria. She is often able to convey her character’s emotions without even speaking; a single glance or longing gaze is enough, always understated but still penetrating.
While the acting and cinematography are commendable, “Lamb” remains a mystifying film in its unexplained weirdness. Perhaps it intends to make social commentary on how humans feel entitled to exploit nature for their own personal gain. Maybe some people will leave the theater pondering their relationship with the natural world; no doubt others will leave thinking, “What did I just watch?” Still, in its bizarre and eerie originality, you can’t deny that it does, in fact, leave you thinking.

When it comes to the Boston rap scene, it’s impossible for the name Oompa to go unnoticed. An acclaimed rapper and spoken word poet known for her unfaltering flow and authentic storytelling, Oompa’s music is truly art, embodying the intersection of earnest introspection and lively beats. Two years after the release of her 2019 album “Cleo,” Oompa has finally released her much-awaited third album entitled “UNBOTHERED.” Oscillating between poignant lyricism and phenomenal production, Oompa’s “UNBOTHERED” serves as a constant reminder that joy will always persist in the face of struggle.
To solidify this theme, she begins the album with clear positive affirmations in the opening track “AMEN”: “I want my peace, I want my space,” she repeats above a slow drum accented tempo. Her coos of “AMEN” acknowledge that she knows exactly what she needs to grow — her peace is inextricable from her space. Beyond the lyrics, the echoing vocals and sultry guitar elements send listeners into another realm, providing that desired space for her message to ring through. The following title track “UNBOTHERED” leans fully into this conversation as Oompa implores her listeners to take actions towards finding the same peace she seeks. In the chorus, she advocates a redefining of self-care and self-improvement to include “therapy...loving on your tribe, when they call you on your shit learn to take that shit in stride.” Layered over a banging bass, Oompa’s desire to uplift her listeners feels both pressing and reflective — the words of someone who has dealt with their own difficulties and come out on the other side.
However, “UNBOTHERED” is not simply a reflective beacon of advice — it is also a celebration of everything from queer sexuality to reclaimed agency. In the sultry “WHERE MY SILKY?” squeaking bed sounds and pounding production transport listeners to Oompa’s bedroom as she proclaims “My heart ain’t up for grabs but my night is.” A love letter to both durags and lesbians everywhere, the seductive energy on this track is infectious. While Oompa sings about cravings for “the places where it be milky, yeah,” it’s apparent how comfortable she is in both her queerness and her sexual presence.
All of these themes come to a head in perhaps the most earnest track of the album, “DEEP.” A pounding bass, quiet electric guitar, and oscillations between lighter breathy vocals and pitched down chanting mirror the physical pace of Oompa’s tryst. Oompa leans into this musical duality as perhaps a further metaphor for her own two-sided identity. As she states, she’s both a “n*gga in these streets but a femme in these sheets.” With ease, Oompa lets listeners into her bedroom in a way that mixes vulnerability and relatability. This confidence reverberates throughout her other pieces as she demonstrates an unwillingness to alter herself for the consumption of others.
The tracks “LEBRON” and “OUTTA PATIENCE” are perhaps the most explicit in this message. In “LEBRON,” a heavy bass and a deepened set of vocals contrast with lighter clicking sounds and a rapid flow to produce a high-energy proclamation of Oompa’s abilities. Definitely leaning towards a hype anthem, “LEBRON” finds Oompa praising her own accomplishments as she says, “You do what you can, I do what I want.” This energy carries over through “OUTTA PATIENCE” as Oompa’s frustrated flow picks up speed in between acknowledgments that she’s “running outta patience.” Her impatience is for good reason — as she says, and listeners would agree, she’s a “supernova.” For someone with so much talent to remain improperly recognized by the industry is a travesty. If this album is any indication, Oompa deserves her accolades.
In “LAKYIRA SAID (Interlude),” Oompa reflects on the meanings of legacy, acknowledging that, “Legacy is a record of the life you live — present tense… If I’m gonna be here, I don’t wanna only keep record of the things trying to kill me — I wanna keep record of the things that tried to keep me.” In all respects, “UNBOTHERED” encapsulates Oompa’s legacy — a poignant acknowledgment of her struggles, her progress, her queerness, her desires, her hopes, and her successes. It is a collection of her pains as well as a collection of her joys. It is personal, unapologetic, inspirational, and incredibly deserving of all the glowing receptions it will receive.

The introduction to Molly Parden’s “Feel Alive Again” cascades like warm rain, washing away guilt and fear. The song is difficult for her to perform, she confesses. “I want everyone in the room to go there with me,” Parden says. “When I can hardly hear my voice over the chattering of the crowd, that’s pretty draining.” Listening to a Molly Parden song is a trip back in time to moments of sharp pain and deep joy. It is emotion delivered simply, authentically, and beautifully. But as much as listeners appreciate her music, the performance of it can be exhausting. Parden is an artist in a world where music is business, and being a performer and writing your truths is a complicated balance to achieve.
Parden was born in Georgia in 1988. She fell into being a musician — that is, the profession chose her. “It was more something that happened to me,” Parden says. She was gifted a guitar at 15 and began making her own music a few years later. “I didn’t know that being an artist was a viable lifestyle,” she says. Unless she could be the next Britney Spears, there was no visible path towards making music her career, something Parden struggles with to this day. To be a musician, “I have to find tours and send emails and keep up to date with my digital distributor… I have to corral musicians to play gigs with me… I have to do everyday things like go to the grocery and keep my tires rotated and balanced, and make money while I’m not on tour,” she says. With over 400,000 monthly listeners on Spotify, a strong repertoire, and an ever-growing audience, one job Molly takes frequently is babysitting. She “really love[s] kids.” She seeks to treat songwriting “purely,” and when she writes, it is still just her and her guitar.
Parden reflects on the music industry with striking honesty. Her songs are about past moments that have hurt and shaped her, yet she sometimes feels like “a cog in the machine,” beholden to the demands of the industry. Her fans, and her connection to them, keep her in the business. “It’s the four or five people a night who will come up to me at the merch table and just say, this song meant so much to me,” she says. “It’s so beautiful how music can bring us together.” And indeed, Parden’s courageous vulnerability and lyrically expressed pain have a profound, unifying effect. Struck by the last chords, one feels cleansed.
“I have found in myself a deep need to belong — and to feel like I belong — to something. To a purpose, to a cause, to a group... I want them to know that they’re getting like the real me.” In a world of ever trendy — and ever canned — pop beats and lyrics, Parden’s heart-felt folk stands out. As Parden embarks on her U.S. tour, one can only hope that she (and her audience) find the connection they are seeking.

Like many Harvard students in the arts, Mia E. Riverton Alpert ’99 had a difficult time seeing a pathway into the entertainment industry after graduation. “All our friends [were] going off to med school or law school or investment banking,” she said, “and we and our peers who were interested in arts and sort of nontraditional careers didn’t have that.”
Mia Alpert would eventually build a career as an accomplished actress and writer, and is best known for producing and starring in the film “Red Doors,” which won best narrative feature at Tribeca in 2005. While she was at Harvard, however, OCS only had what she described as a dusty old binder containing one handwritten sheet with the contact information of just five or six alumni working in the arts and entertainment. With a laugh, she said, “And so I was like, okay, I just gotta do this myself.”
Mia Alpert went on to found Harvardwood in 1999 with fellow Harvard alumni Stacy Cohen and Adam Fratto. Since then, the organization has grown to more than 10,000 members around the world. It also introduced Mia Alpert to her husband, David S. Alpert ’97, who is the CEO of Skybound Entertainment and has served as executive producer on shows including “The Walking Dead,” “Invincible” and “Locke & Key.” As the two answered questions, they each made sure the other was sharing the full extent of their thoughts and accomplishments.
The pair recently launched the Mia and David Alpert Harvardwood Artist Launch Fellowship. The multiyear gift is awarded annually to “support one recent graduate from the College for one year as they pursue their artistic projects.” The fellowship includes a $24,000 grant and will pair the Alpert Harvardwood Fellow with a mentor in their artistic field to help guide them as they pursue their creative projects. The application requires a resume, a work sample or portfolio, a short (one to two minute) introductory video, an artist statement (in written, audio or video format), a creative plan with an overview of their envisioned project(s) and a projected budget for the term of the Fellowship.
The pair share a boundless enthusiasm and passion for the Fellowship, citing the difficult decisions faced by many artists who juggle pursuing their artistic passions with student loans, rent, and job security. Mia Alpert, who spent her college summers interning at companies like Boston Consulting Group and Goldman Sachs, knows this feeling all too well. With this fellowship, she hopes to level the playing field so that future fellows won’t have to stress as much. “Not that it’s an indefinite kind of patronage,” she said. “But [they] can really get their portfolio or their reel or whatever it is in order, and work on their craft, and develop relationships, and have a mentorship, and then be ready to go down that path with a little more certainty and a little demystification of this crazy Hollywood arts thing that is so enticing and yet so frightening at the same time.”
David Alpert, who always knew he wanted to pursue a career in entertainment, had the same struggle, and ended up using law school as the springboard to his entertainment career. He brought up an idea one of his mentors taught him, that the life cycle of successful careers can be broken down into three categories: learning, earning, and returning. “We’re now sort of in the… returning phase, which is what we’re doing here,” he said. “But we want to also feed that cycle and [make] the ratio of success for those people higher… we want people to have an easier chance and easier opportunity to work.”
Something else the duo stressed is their commitment to equity, a concept that is sorely lacking in the arts and entertainment industry at large. “This is yet another way to try to do our part to make access available for people who otherwise wouldn't have access through other means,” Mia Alpert said. “And we think that over time, that will help contribute to underrepresented voices and stories and art finding an audience and those artists finding a career.”
The pair also had some advice for future applicants, beginning with carefully reading over the entire application. David Alpert encouraged applicants to strive for artistic specificity. “If it's like, I love science fiction and I know every single science fiction novel that's been written the last 50 years, there's gonna be somebody making a science fiction movie, video game, TV show that you will be useful to,” he said. “And then it will be sort of connected to the thing that you are already doing, and having that sort of level of expertise sooner increases your value and provides a broader set of opportunities.”
Mia Alpert stressed that focusing on the commercial side of creativity is just as important as focusing on the art itself, an element the Fellowship application strongly emphasizes. “There's pieces of it that are very like — develop a budget, develop a creative plan, these are to-do lists, these are excel spreadsheets — these are things that artists typically wouldn't necessarily be running to [do],” she explained. “They want to wait for the muse to come and tell them what to do, but that's just not how it works in the business of art and entertainment.”
More than anything, though, Mia and David Alpert want applicants to know that what they are doing and the art they create is valued, important, and impactful. “The arts matter, the arts change culture, we really believe that the arts have possibly a bigger influence on the culture than even government and politics… [this fellowship is] our way of saying art matters, you matter, if you're an artist we love you, and we support you, and we want to help you.”
The application for the Mia and David Alpert Harvardwood Artist Launch Fellowship are due by January 10, 2022, and can be found on harvardwood.org.

Unfortunately, it’s that time of year again: Musicians and marketing campaigns are starting their premature Christmas celebrations, and Kelly Clarkson’s newest album “When Christmas Comes Around…,” released on Oct. 15, is no exception. The long-revered legend has not had a big hit since the debut single “Heartbeat Song” from her 2015 album “Piece by Piece,” but still remained in the public eye for “The Kelly Clarkson Show” and her role as one of the hosts on “The Voice.” Furthermore, Clarkson has not released a Christmas album since 2013. That record, “Wrapped in Red,” rode its classic mistletoe-and-Christmas-jingle sentiment to the Billboard 200. Likewise, her newest Christmas album brings the cheer and hopeful aspiration to this upcoming holiday season.
Both of Clarkson’s Christmas albums explore a more classical holiday repertoire with songs like “Rocking Around The Christmas Tree” and “Baby, It’s Cold Outside.” Nevertheless, originals like “Glow” and “Blessed” are welcome additions to “When Christmas Comes Around…,” and the album even features collaborations with Ariana Grande and Chris Stapleton. Despite the early release date, Clarkson provides a heartwarming and nostalgic selection of songs that will make listeners forget that it is still October. Her familiar full-ranging vocals comfortably suit the style of the album, delivering Christmas cheer alongside an abundance of all the usual Christmas-related instruments: jingle bells and tambourines, Christmas choirs, and orchestras. Clarkson’s vocals have no doubt retained their compelling edge, and this album certainly delivers sentimental and homey Christmas vibes for her fans. However, for the many who are sick of the progressively earlier and earlier Christmas promotions that last for weeks (sometimes even months) before Christmas time, it may be worth it to avoid this album until at least mid-November.
Like many other artists that release Christmas albums in late October or early November, “When Christmas Comes Around…” speaks to the popularity of the Christmas season as the most promoted holiday in the U.S. Although Clarkson’s album does not provide a large selection of novel Christmas songs, “When Christmas Comes Around…” reminds listeners that it is okay to rejoice, even in the aftermath of such a difficult almost-two year period. It brings back the sentiment of familial comfort that many Americans love to partake in during the coldest part of the year, and reminds everyone that it is alright to look forward to a time when the pandemic will be a thing of the past. Even if it means listening to cozy Christmas albums like “When Christmas Comes Around…,” we can all take a step towards a more hopeful present and future this Christmas season.

Maybe it was the inscribed frame around the stage, or the Greek and Roman statues lining the top balcony, or maybe even the faint but familiar smell of rosin and cologne, but stepping into Symphony Hall for the first time and hearing the sweet sounds of the orchestra warming up stirred up a powerful sense of nostalgia. When Conductor and Music Director Andris Nelsons took the stage, the nearly full audience lightly applauded his entrance before he lifted his baton. There was a magical moment right before the baton fell, where even the audience could not help but hold their breath. Despite some small flaws in their performance, the world-renowned Boston Symphony Orchestra sure did live up to their reputation.
For the second program of the season, the BSO and Nelsons chose to honor the great Jean Sibelius with a simple three-piece program consisting of William Grant Still’s “Threnody: In Memory of Jean Sibelius,” Richard Strauss’ “Symphonic Fantasy on Die Frau ohne Schatten (The Woman Without a Shadow),” and Sibelius’ turbulent and triumphant Violin Concerto in D minor, Op. 47, performed by Georgian violinist Lisa Batiashvili. Strauss conducted the 1905 premiere of Sibelius’ violin concerto, and Still and Sibelius admired each other’s works. Some string players, in addition to the winds, brass, percussion, and conductor, performed without masks, and seeing their smiles and expressions on stage once again was lovely.
The first piece on the program was the Still, a short and lyrical piece paying homage to Sibelius by taking the audience through his different compositional styles. Still calls on Sibelius’ grandiose and folk-like themes, like those in his “Finlandia,” in the brass and strings, and the piece does not overstay its welcome. While Nelsons and the BSO lacked energy, this opener was just a taste of what the rest of the evening would showcase.
The Strauss exploded from the stage, the low brass section boasting their depth and power. The piece is a symphonic recomposition of one of his lesser-known operas but still a meaningful composition, going through the opera’s major themes like an excellent SparkNotes summary. Nelsons seemed more passionate about this piece, doing his best impression of Karajan by digging his arms into the strings to bring out their rich soul, all while skillfully balancing the massive orchestra. Although better than in the Still, the BSO was still resistant to outward emotions as they performed the piece; however, they were definitely more engaged both in the mannerisms in which they responded to Nelsons as well as their own sound. Assistant principal cellist Olver Aldort especially stood out, captivating the audience with his vibrato and flamboyant head movements. Another highlight of the piece was the warm and welcoming tenor trombone solo by Toby Oft. Very rarely have I heard such a soaring yet intimate sound from a trombone, and he was deservedly applauded after the performance.
The final performance was the Sibelius Violin Concerto, with Lisa Batiashvili at the helm. She performed with the confidence of a soloist throughout the entire concerto, skillfully maneuvering the incredibly difficult virtuosic passages. However, whether from nerves or maybe just her interpretation, moments of hesitancy abounded in her playing, especially in the more technical passages. These extremely subtle hesitations, especially in the first movement, often hindered her expression. Furthermore, in very intense and loud passages, it often felt as though she would press a little too much into the instrument, sacrificing her sound for emphasis. In contrast, in very soft and delicate passages, Batiashvili masterfully maneuvered around subtle yet powerful inflexions in the color of her sound and tone, giving each note so much energy while Nelsons made sure that the orchestra was conscious of her tender playing. This was especially clear in the second movement, where she successfully explored an incredible range in dynamics and colors. The fiendishly difficult third movement also showcased her incredible technical ability, but once again, the same patterns of sacrificing technique for musicality often emerged. With all that said, the performance was incredible. To finish off a fantastic evening, the audience rose to their feet to invite the soloist for an encore, where she delivered a simple but heartfelt performance of a folk song dedicated to Helsinki: a perfect end to an intense concert and a great welcome back to Symphony Hall.

For a movie starring Benedict Cumberbatch and an array of perfectly-groomed, fluffy kittens, “The Electrical Life of Louis Wain” is an unexpectedly tiresome ride. Directed by Will Sharpe, the film is a dramatic biopic of 19th century English artist Louis Wain, famed for his colorful, anthropomorphized drawings of cats. Wain, who was later diagnosed with schizophrenia, was a complex man in real life, but is reduced in Sharpe’s highly-stylized film into a quirky cartoon character that only teases at being a real man.
Olivia Colman narrates the film in a persistently Mary Poppins-esque voice that clashes with the movie’s overall tragic tone. The story stretches from Wain’s relationship with his cancer-ridden wife Emily Richardson (Claire Foy) to his chronic financial turmoil as he struggles to take care of his mother and six sisters. Throughout, the film revels in its own quirkiness. Full of fanciful costumes, risqué encounters in the bedroom, and a governess who teaches her female wards sword-fighting, “The Electrical Life of Louis Wain” progresses like a whimsical Dickens novel. The movie isn’t at all historically accurate, nor does it try to be –– a choice that leaves it teetering between mimicking a children’s bedtime story and actualizing the painful reality of Wain’s life.
Fans of Cumberbatch won’t be surprised to find him reprising the role of the eccentric, socially-awkward genius, which he plays in “The Imitation Game” (2014) as Alan Turing and in the BBC series “Sherlock” (2010-2017) as the eponymous detective. This time, though, the actor fails to revitalize his character in any fresh, exciting way –– Cumberbatch’s Louis Wain, who can whip up a sketch in less than a minute, stands painfully straight at all times and stutters when he speaks, leaving him feeling more like one of the cartoon characters he draws for the newspaper than a real-life man and artist.
Speaking of art, “The Electrical Life of Louis Wain” is puzzlingly devoid of Wain’s artistic pursuits and achievements. Sharpe sporadically includes scenes of Wain painting or transporting wagons full of cats –– his models –– but these rare bits of artistry are thrown together with confusing monologues of Wain preaching about the wonders of electricity. In trying to capture the many facets of Louis Wain –– artist, inventor, and family man –– Sharpe fails to lend depth to any of them, leaving the audience with a half-baked idea of who the real Louis Wain truly was.
Still, Sharpe’s creative approach is not without merit and results in a deliberately-crafted, visually-rewarding film. Special effects almost imperceptibly render landscape shots into paintings that match Wain’s own fantastical style. In a particularly hallucinogenic sequence, the audience enters Wain’s mind via a digitally-produced montage of wide-eyed, cartoonish “Louis Wain” cats. It seems that the real artist in the movie is not Louis Wain, who never truly evolves from the idiosyncratic man first seen handing out sketches for free, but Sharpe himself. The director aspires to capture Wain’s spirit by mimicking his eccentric style –– a technique that may work for the cats Wain draws, but leads to a flat protagonist when applied to a human being.

Pop-rock band Against The Current played at the Sonia on Oct. 5 for the last show of their Fever Tour. The band, which includes vocalist Chrissy Costanza, guitarist Dan Gow, and drummer Will Ferri, who was touring to promote their new EP “fever,” delivered a high-energy performance that got the crowd jumping and clapping along to every song.
The New York-based band started the concert with “that won’t save us,” a powerful rock song that showcased Costanza’s powerhouse vocals. Standing at only 5’1” tall, Costanza nevertheless seemed to fill up the whole stage — running, jumping, and waving her arms as she belted out songs.
The stage itself was illuminated by a minimalist set of lights that shifted colors depending on the mood of each song — bright red for the explosive “Blood Like Gasoline,” neon green for the high-energy “burn it down,” a somber blue for the ballad “shatter.” The set created a simple but effective atmosphere to draw full attention to Costanza.
The band played a mix of songs across their eight-year repertoire, performing new songs from “fever” alongside older hits such as “Gravity” and “Running with the Wild Things.” They also performed a cover of Taking Back Sunday’s “MakeDamnSure,” bringing their own sound to a song that Constanza said inspired her in the early days of Against The Current.
Costanza had an infectious energy throughout the show, urging the audience to jump and sing along through upbeat, irresistibly danceable songs such as “again&again” and “burn it down.” But she was also able to focus that energy during quieter songs like “shatter,” channeling her magnetic presence as she stood still in front of a microphone, singing about heartbreak.
Costanza’s charisma showed through even when not performing. Between songs, she displayed a down-to-earth, self-deprecating personality, sharing an anecdote about a wardrobe mishap and poking fun at her time in quarantine.
“Do you know how hard it is to come back up hereafter, like, two years of just sitting in my chair, playing video games for twelve hours a day?” she said, bending down into an exaggeratedly hunched posture in an impression of her playing video games.
Costanza gave the impression of having a casual conversation with the audience and her band, talking honestly about her long plane flight and reminding everyone in the audience to stay hydrated. She even paused the show at one point to get one of her bandmates an apple cider.
She also spoke more seriously about how Against The Current and other music artists were affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.
“We’re so happy to be back because we were gone for so long, as every band was. We couldn’t get out here, and it was one of the hardest experiences for any artist,” she said. “So I want to make sure we never take another night like this for granted.”
Against The Current ended their set with fan-favorite “Wasteland,” an emotionally charged rock ballad under purple lights. For the encore, they returned with “Legends Never Die,” a hit single written for the 2017 League of Legends World Championship. The song works just as well outside of the “League of Legends” context, and it paired with the final song, “weapon,” to bring a powerful finale to the show.
“We promise we love you,” Costanza said, addressing the audience and staff at the Sonia. “We’re having a great time. Thank you so much. Thank you for your ciders.”

If you are a dudebro who still thinks Thanos was a good villain, your favorite part of “Venom: Let There Be Carnage” will be the mid-credits scene. Any other member of the population that watches this movie on its own terms may find an endearing, wildly fun, and sometimes poetic ode to the beauty of dissonance. And, yes, a love story.
In this sequel to “Venom,” we find reporter Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) and his alien symbiote Venom, also voiced by Hardy, struggling to live together. This conflict is exacerbated once Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson), a serial killer, demands that Eddie publish his life story. Long story short, Cletus gets close enough to bite Eddie and ingest his blood, transforming into the red symbiote Carnage. It’s a chaotic downturn that sends the protagonist pair into a tailspin argument, much to the audience’s amusement.
The love story is hard to miss and harder to deny, though it is by no means functional. Venom wants to be out in the world biting off bad guys’ heads. Eddie, meanwhile, pleads for Venom to understand: “This is not about wanting to be the hero for me, man. This is about wanting to live in peace,” he says. The holes in Eddie’s already disheveled apartment ceiling tell us this argument has happened before. It’s messy, personal, and dramatic — it’s love.
Like any cinematic love story, the pair must break up to discover they want to be together. After the television has been broken and a chicken’s life is threatened, Venom gives Carrie Underwood a run for her money by ripping Eddie’s treasured motorcycle into pieces and attending an “LGBTQIA kind of festival” where he proudly proclaims, “I am out of the Eddie closet!” Though admittedly humorous, breaking Eddie’s motorcycle is yet another symbol of how deeply the two care for each other. Given Eddie’s borderline suicidal driving the last time he was heartbroken, Venom doesn’t want to see Eddie hurt driving recklessly if he’s not around to heal him — which is somewhat ironic given how many times Venom has broken Eddie’s nose.
And if all this isn’t enough, Tom Hardy, who shared a writing credit on the movie, confirmed: “Yeah, it is 100% a love story.” A human as messy as Eddie and an alien as chaotic as Venom sharing a body shouldn’t work. In these moments of tenderness, however, Kelly Marcel’s writing and Hardy’s acting make it impossible to deny that they belong together.
The action scenes only serve to strengthen this thread of dysfunctional love. Woody Harrelson and Naomie Harris, who plays Frances Barrison, for example, deliver a believable and entertaining couple that just happen to be in love with vengeance too. Against a deliciously violent backdrop of alien tentacles and wailing police sirens, Cletus and Frances make out and express their genuine love several times throughout their prison break scene. The movie leans into this discordance in what makes for a fun final battle in the church where Cletus and Frances are sharing their vows before they plan to kill their enemies: Eddie, Venom, and Patrick Mulligan (Stephen Graham), the cop who took out Frances’ eye. The symbiotes trade blows that align with the heavy rings of a bell, transforming them between alien and human each time. Eddie to Venom. Carnage to Cletus. In addition to its visual appeal, this schism makes the final symbiosis, when Eddie and Venom recognize they are compatible where Carnage and Cletus are not, all the more poignant.
One of the film’s few missed notes comes from its treatment of Frances. After her sonic scream accidentally hurts Carnage, it is revealed she can never use her powers to protect Cletus. Given the symbiotes’ vulnerability to sound and fire and Carnage’s superior strength, Frances’ sonic scream gave her the potential to be the secret weapon Eddie and Venom needed to win the final battle. Alternatively, her powers could have presented an interesting narrative for her if Cletus was unable to stop Carnage from hurting her and she defended herself, demonstrating a refusal to be silenced even for love. Thus, when she is snuffed out mid-scream by the falling church bell, her ending falls short of poetic justice. Hopefully, she is just momentarily trapped under the enormous bell, and will return as an even more chaotic villain in future movies.
In not shying away from the weirdness of a comic book adaptation, “Venom: Let There Be Carnage” manages to tell an engaging story about living and loving dysfunctionally.

Recent leaked documents reviewed by the Wall Street Journal show that Facebook is aware of the negative impacts Instagram has on teenagers, including increased rates of anxiety and depression.
“Algorithms are designed to keep us engaged. They are not designed to maximize our mental health, wellbeing, or general happiness,” said Open Influence CEO and Co-Founder and Forbes 30 Under 30 Eric Dahan.
Dahan’s company, Open Influence, has partnered with over 1,000 of the world’s biggest companies, such as Disney, Netflix, Universal, and McDonald’s, to design Gen-Z marketing campaigns.
“When we go online, we’re comparing our normal self to the best image everyone else is projecting, and we’re putting that in a bucket,” said Dahan, explaining the negative impacts of social media. “We’re comparing our average selves to everyone’s best self collectively.”
Dahan explained how this issue translates into the context of the body. Younger generations regularly view images of bodies that are posted with the intent of presenting a face of perfection. These images utilize filters and editing to create an unattainable standard that people then compare themselves to.
And yet, there remain undeniably positive elements of social media.
“On one hand, we’ve democratized information. Anyone can just go and create content, right? You don’t have to hope to sign with a big publisher or the right television network or get picked up by a radio series, whatever it is, right? You don’t have to really worry about that. You can just go online and start creating,” said Dahan.
Though this is empowering, Dahan said it also can lead to misinformation and the portrayal of unrealistic expectations.
Additionally, the issue of accountability continues to be as relevant as it is complex.
“I believe that the social platforms are ultimately responsible [for harm caused by social media] since the algorithms and platform design determine how users behave on the platform,” Dahan said. “Therefore small feature and algorithm changes could easily and quickly drive positive change.”
While Instagram was under fire for the negative impacts their platform had on user mental health, TikTok released a series of new resources to support their community’s well-being.
“We’re proud that our platform has become a place where people can share their personal experiences with mental well-being, find community and support each other, and we take very seriously our responsibility to keep TikTok a safe space for these important conversations,” said TikTok Director of Policy Tara Wadhwa in their Sept. 14 announcement.
Measures outlined in the announcement are meant to create this safe space, including expanded search interventions in relation to suicide, stronger sensitive content warning labels, and expanded information and guides on eating disorders.
However, in Dahan’s eyes, solutions could go farther.
“Warnings help, but they cannot have us unsee content or prevent the psychological effects to our subconscious. What would be more effective would be changing the algorithms to optimize for mental health. Arguably though, that could mean users are less engaged which ultimately would hurt the platforms.”
Another consideration is the role of content producers, including brands and influencers.
Dahan said that, though the category of influencers is very broad, the specific subcategory of fashion, beauty, and lifestyle influencers has definitely contributed to social media’s negative impact on mental health.
Dahan said his company always places a diverse set of influencers in front of a brand. And yet, on the brand side, “The people making those [contracting] decisions will bring those biases in, of who they thought was the face of the brand, or would be a good sort of representation,” he said.
He went on to explain that in the past year, brands strived to strengthen their diversity, inclusion, and representation initiatives.
“Those decision makers on the brand side were not only more conscious about this, but they were looking to say, we need to drive more diversity and inclusion,” he said.
“We’ve seen a huge price spike in minority influencers, just because so many brands have been seeking them out, and so much so that pricing for African American, or Latino, or Asian influencers have outpriced Caucasian influencers.”
However, the current negative impacts of social media persist. Updated initiatives on some platforms to mitigate these impacts and increasingly diverse representation within the influencer community is a start. To truly mitigate these harms, far more action is needed.

DC Comics’ iconic black-clad bat-emulating superhero has taken many forms on the big screen. From the comically miscast George Clooney in the 1997 film “Batman and Robin” to the adaptive genius of Lego Batman in recent years, Batman films are notoriously polarizing. Ben Affleck’s most recent grizzled and cranky take on the hero in “Justice League” proved to be no exception. However, in this age of film reboots and revivals, “Planet of the Apes” director Matt Reeves and “Twilight” (or “Harry Potter,” depending on your allegiance) star Robert Pattinson have risen to the challenge. The main trailer for their highly-anticipated 2022 film “The Batman” premiered at DC FanDome last Saturday, begging the question: Will DC finally break the curse of mediocre Batman movies?
The trailer for this standalone take on Batman opens with the dramatic and film noir-esque arrest of the Riddler on a rainy Gotham City night. Played in this version by actor Paul Dano, the Riddler’s strange, eclectic, and dubiously villainous characterization lends itself to constant aesthetic and narrative adaptation, from Jim Carrey’s question-mark-covered trickster to Young Justice’s cheeky “I am bush” animated criminal pawn to this new creepy (and surprisingly not green-suited) serial killer. After this introduction to a less-than-cheery Gotham, the trailer cuts to the traditional Bat-Signal across a stormy sky, and the first of many dark, fast-paced fight scenes featuring Pattinson’s new Batman. This first fight scene brings more questions than answers: Are the clown-faced thugs a reference to the Joker? Just how bulletproof is this Batsuit? Does the fight scene’s electrifying end suggest this Batman will not follow the “no kill” code?
Instead of answers, the trailer moves to a tense confrontation between a jailed, creepily calm Riddler and an enraged Batman yelling “What have you done?” across a Gotham City Police Department interrogation table. Pattinson and Reeves both noted in multiple interviews that this film’s Batman would be young and tortured, and his emotional instability becomes extremely palpable in this clip. The tension, resolved by a typical action movie explosion, morphs into the familiar image of Batman brooding as an uncostumed Bruce Wayne is shown outside the Gotham mayor’s funeral. This undertone of political upheaval, replete with hints of insider corruption and an absurdly large police presence, courses through the rest of the trailer (and presumably film) as well.
But no blockbuster superhero movie is complete without a femme fatale, so in struts Zoë Kravitz as Selina Kyle, a.k.a. Catwoman. Kravitz’s introduction is accompanied by a montage of typical Catwoman tropes: a proclamation of her independence, fiery fight scenes, motorcycles, and seducing the Batman. The trailer then rapidly cuts to reveal Andy Serkis as Bruce’s faithful companion Alfred, and Colin Farrell as the crime boss the Penguin. This casting marks yet another introduction of an iconic villain and notable actor, and Reeve’s strategy to balance all these superstars and storylines will certainly be intriguing.
The trailer speeds on, defined by short, easter-egg-rich scenes: Pattinson amidst a scattering of evidence and detective theories strewn across the floor, Bat-Cat fight scenes and flirtations, and much more low-visibility, intense Batman combat. Pattinson once again repeats the “I’m vengeance” line, leading into the next action sequence, GCPD clamor, dramatic violence, and the Riddler’s voiceover teasing, “What’s black and blue, and dead all over?” The trailer ends with an extended car chase clip between Batman and the Penguin, culminating in an upside-down shot from the Penguin’s perspective of a backlit Batman striding out of the fire, looking like vengeance himself.
A far cry from Affleck’s Batman, who embodied the legend of the unruffleable mastermind in the recently released “Justice League” Snyder cut, this new Batman exudes unrestrained rage and borderline madness. The trailer adheres to the classic dark, dramatic aesthetics of Batman films, and has no shortage of action star scenes. Yet Reeves and DC are by no means trying to emulate the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s superhero film format as they did in “Justice League.” Instead, they unearth a rare portrayal of a young and unseasoned Batman. This Batman will have no connection to the multiverse experiment in the upcoming “The Flash'' movie, which perhaps bodes well for this tumultuous franchise. Unbound from further expectations and other iconic superheroes, this standalone iteration of the Batman gives the film a chance to lean into the darkness and grit that makes the Dark Knight unique from the Supermans and Avengers of mainstream cinema.
“The Batman” will premiere in theaters on March 4th, 2022.

On Oct. 11, couple Machine Gun Kelly (M.G.K.) and Megan Fox gave GQ Magazine a sneak-peek into their relationship, including a questionable anecdote on how the two lovebirds first met when M.G.K. told Fox he was… weed?
The compelling pair have been together since June 2020, and have sparked conversation surrounding their unique expressions of affection from the beginning. During the interview in question, Fox and M.G.K. reflected on how they first met at a party in Los Angeles. “I just remember this tall, blond, ghostly creature and I looked up and I was like, ‘You smell like weed.’ He looked down at me and he was like, ‘I am weed,’” Fox said. “Then, I swear to God, he disappeared like a ninja in a smoke bomb.”
The odd interaction is reminiscent of a poorly written Wattpad fanfiction or YA novel and has even caused some fans to question not only M.G.K.'s thought process but, more radically, their long-held allegiance to icon Megan Fox. While the general reaction to this interaction and much of the pairing’s relationship has been that of confusion and curiosity, I present the following rebuttal in response to those questioning the relationship’s apocalyptic fairy tale theme: Why not?
The couple graces GQ’s Autumn/Winter 2021 cover in a grayscale, mobster-esque series of images. Regardless of whether the connection will last, both parties are well within their right to strive for their idealized relationship, even if that entails christening each other with matching tattoos reading “The darkest fairytale.” Sure, Fox and M.G.K. may both be in their 30s with children and entire artistic careers, but who’s to say that should stop them from fulfilling their dark twisted fantasies in the here and now?
Fox and M.G.K. are not the first to do it, of course. Take, for example, the short-lived yet fast-paced relationship between musician Grimes and tech mogul Elon Musk. An iconic crossover episode between an electropop auteur and an ethically questionable titan of industry, the relationship’s highlights included matching anime Twitter icons and a baby by the name of X Æ A-Xii. The pairing remained in the spotlight for its entire three-year run, partially due on the one hand to the inescapable publicization of celebrity lives, and, on the other, the couple’s extensive use of Twitter to talk to each other.
Angelina Jolie’s similarly aestheticized and fleeting romance with Billy Bob Thorton was memorialized by a now-removed tattoo of Thorton’s name on Jolie’s right arm and their decision to wear vials of each other’s blood around their necks. In the early 2000s, the public was absolutely fascinated by this pairing. It was quite honestly the pinnacle of modern romance. The mix of positive and negative reactions that fueled steady interest in their peculiar displays of affection seem to parallel the response to Fox and M.G.K.
All of this is to say that even though the public reserves the intrinsic right to hate things, celebrities’ rights to enjoy things must also be appreciated. While the fact that Megan Fox was swooned by a claim to exist as marijuana may be a truth some would rather have not known, one must also respect the confidence exhibited by the couple in their public expression of these intimate relationship details. There’s an inherent hypocrisy to our desire for celebrity information coupled with our repulsion when the information is not what we expected. Some celebrities’ seemingly indiscriminate disclosure of personal details can even be seen as a push-back against and subversion of the common lack of privacy that is a staple of superstar life.
While it would be outlandish to expect a co-worker to announce each and every one of their romantic pitfalls, squabbles with the law, or opinions on major political topics while preparing the morning coffee, celebrities are expected to present these aspects of their lives or otherwise have them leaked. With the number of big names whose personal lives are common knowledge, it is not such an outlandish thought that they may decide to take the dissemination of their personal information into their own hands. With the public’s high demand for details on celebrities’ lives, why shouldn’t celebs take it upon themselves to give the public exactly what they are asking for?
So in other words, when it comes to M.G.K. and Megan Fox: Why not?

On Oct. 20, former U.S. President Donald J. Trump announced plans to release a new social network, TRUTH Social, to the public in early 2022 with a beta launch scheduled for next month. This announcement has come after the former President’s years-long call to action against “Big Tech” companies and “fake news” media.
The new social network will be released under the merger between “Trump Media & Technology Group” and a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC). An SPAC is a company with the sole purpose of generating capital through an initial public offering in the stock market so that it can merge with an existing company.
Throughout the press release which announced these new endeavors, Donald Trump seems to have stayed true to his fight against mainstream media and monopolized social industries. A section of the release reads: “Trump Media & Technology Group's mission is to create a rival to the liberal media consortium and fight back against the "Big Tech” companies of Silicon Valley, which have used their unilateral power to silence opposing voices in America.”
Posts on the new social media platform may be formally referred to as “TRUTHS,” as Trump mentions his plans to send out his first “TRUTH” soon. The TRUTH Social interface appears to be similar to that of Twitter, with a timeline of posts from accounts you follow and the option to post various types of media such as photos, videos, text, and gifs. The application also allows for users to like, reshare, and reply to posts.
Whether this platform — supposedly based on honesty — will live up to its name is still up in the air. Despite its written commitment to free expression, there is no sign of a dislike button in the video tour of the app’s interface. While Twitter has yet to release a downvote button either, its implementation has been in testing since July. The inclusion of this feature seems to only add to users’ ability to freely express themselves. Therefore, its omission from TRUTH Social is interesting.
Another question that arises around the platform’s vehement opposition to censorship and “cancel culture” is how hate speech and misinformation will be handled. While most social media platforms have a mechanism for deleting or flagging information that does not follow its guidelines of ethical social behavior, TRUTH Social appears as though it intends to push back against those very regulations. Without such rules, the extent to which hate speech and immoral discourse will be tolerated on the new application is to be determined.
Following the announcement of TRUTH Social, the decentralized hacktivist group, Anonymous, gained access to the unreleased social networking platform and posted images of defecating pigs among other expletives. The media was posted under the account name “donaldjtrump” and was, according to Anonymous, a part of their “online war against hate.” This immediate protest against the new app, which occurred just hours after the announcement was made, highlights continued political polarization in social media spaces, especially as it relates to the 2020 election and presidential candidates.
In addition to the social networking platform, Trump Media & Technology Group intends to release an on-demand video service called TMTG+ featuring “'non-woke' entertainment programming, news, podcasts, and more.” Previous Executive Producer of “Deal or No Deal” and “America’s Got Talent,” Scott St. John, has been named as the leader of the streaming platform.
In January, many of the major social networking sites, including Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat, banned or suspended the former President’s accounts following the Jan. 6th attacks on the United States Capitol. Leading up to his removal from social media platforms, Twitter began deleting or flagging a large portion of Trump’s tweets due to misleading and false information. This has played a major role in Trump’s campaign against cancel culture and “woke” social media. Trump has since been restricted to public outreach through physical rallies, email subscriptions, and press releases such as the one which announced TRUTH Social. With Trump unable to access other public social media platforms for over ten months, the release of this new platform comes with justified concerns about the ethical consequences of his return.

Being a kid is hard — between having no autonomy, trying to figure out right from wrong, and all the while trying to steer clear of kids who may be bad influences, it’s a lot for anyone to handle. But what happens when the bad influences are actually the adults in your life? “Ten Year Old Tom” answers that question, and does a wonderful job of it.
Created by Steve Dildarian, “Ten Year Old Tom” follows, as the name suggests, a 10-year-old boy named Tom, also voiced by Dildarian. Tom is a mild-mannered kid living with his newly-single mother following his father’s abandonment to go live with another woman in Myrtle Beach. If life at home wasn’t already hard enough, school isn’t much better either. He doesn’t have many friends besides his buddy Nelson (Byron Bowers), and he is generally held in low esteem by not only his classmates, but their parents. In the premiere episode, for instance, Tom is forced to quit the bassoon after being booed off stage and insulted by parents at a school performance. This sets the tone for the rest of the first season. Much of the series centers around a ten-year-old being ridiculed by the people you’d least expect, and such a dynamic is largely unseen in television and adds to the show’s humor.
On top of that, Tom is constantly being swayed in the wrong direction and exposed to wildly inappropriate situations by the adults in his life. Later on in the season, when Tom becomes class treasurer, a classmate’s father helps Tom “cook the books” for his class budget. At the end of the episode, as with pretty much every other, Tom ends up taking the fall for actions that were heavily influenced by a reckless grown-up. Such interactions leave the audience with a bad taste in their mouth, but this is typically balanced out by the shock humor associated with these encounters.
The premise is admittedly simple, with most of the episodes following a similar plot, but the show is entertaining nonetheless. What makes “Ten Year Old Tom” so unique is that, unlike other animated series centered around children, it’s not Tom or his peers who are the driving force behind his misadventures; it’s usually an ill-intentioned adult. While the show may exaggerate situations for comedic effect, this isn’t completely untrue to life. Kids, for all their lack of experience, are in some ways ethically blank slates. It’s usually the adults around them who lie, scheme, and try to orchestrate situations to their advantage. This dynamic that underlies so many of the show’s episodes is what makes it so charming — it subverts any preconceived notions we have about the rules governing relationships between children and adults, notions that are often supported by mainstream media. In one episode, a character named Dakota says something to Tom which is especially true for him, but also applies to those watching: “I think as we get older, one thing you’re going to look back on is which adults you listened to.”
It’s worth noting that Tom, as well as other characters on the show, are fairly one-dimensional. From start to finish, Tom doesn’t really have any marked character development, and there doesn’t seem to be any kind of shift in the way he’s perceived. One would think this would make him difficult to relate to, but it doesn’t. It’s Tom’s nondescriptness that makes it so easy for us to project ourselves onto him. His most distinguishing qualities are that he minds his business and tries his best, regardless of the situation. Somehow, however, he always ends up being lured in the wrong direction by someone who’s supposed to know better, and then receives the blame for what happened. Tom does everything he’s supposed to, but still can’t seem to catch a break. It wouldn’t be a stretch to say that most people have felt like that at one point in time, especially as a kid. This goes doubly for people who had a difficult or dysfunctional home life growing up. Tom’s mother struggles to provide for him, and she encourages many of the schemes he becomes entangled in as a means to gain money for the two of them. For Tom and other children, home is associated with anything but security. The show does a great job of showcasing this in a way that’s honest, but still lighthearted and amusing.
Between its unconventional depictions of child-adult relationships, life in a dysfunctional family, and the frustrations of being a kid, “Ten Year Old Tom” is a show almost anyone can relate to. The show, like Tom, is in its early stages, and it’ll be great to see where its writers take him next.

A Note from the Editorial Board: The following piece includes discussion of severe mental health struggles and suicide. We’ve compiled a few resources that might be useful to any readers in need of help or support. Please make sure to take care of yourselves — seeking help is always worthwhile.
The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is a hotline for individuals in crisis or for those looking to help someone else. To speak with a certified listener, call 1-800-273-8255.
If you are enrolled, Harvard's Counseling and Mental Health Services offers no cost support, including Urgent Care appointments at (617) 495-5711.
For international students, here’s a list of some internationally available support hotlines that might be helpful.
On Oct. 16, 1,000 backpacks lined Harvard Yard. While we usually don’t think twice about the bags we carry with us every day, these backpacks sprawled across the grass symbolized the average number of college students we lose to suicide each year; the number of backpacks that no longer have owners to carry them.
This display — brought to campus by the Harvard chapter of Active Minds, a national organization devoted to improving mental health in young adults — was bright with vibrant colors. Its presence, however, was a jarring reminder of the mental health crisis that is casting a shadow over campuses across the U.S., including ours.
We want to applaud Harvard Active Minds for this display. Talking about suicide is difficult, but as the title of the exhibit, “Send Silence Packing,” implies, is imperative to ending the stigma that keeps students from seeking help before it is too late.
This display, with its overwhelming physical presence, reminds us that even though we too have physically returned to campus after a year away, the struggle of maintaining our mental health never left. And there are grave consequences of not giving mental health the attention it necessitates: These backpacks belonged to best friends, problem set buddies, teammates, and roommates. Demanding our attention as we passed through the Yard, the exhibit forced us to hit pause; to stop going through the motions for a moment, and to think about how we might have cared for these students and what we want our community — as a support system, and as a collectivity — to look like moving forward.
To the Harvard community: We must do a better job of actually seeing and reaching one another, particularly during difficult times.
Even before the pandemic, we have long struggled with how to effectively support one another through mental health challenges at Harvard. This is a function of being enmeshed in a culture that celebrates perseverance and looks down upon taking time to care for ourselves and for others. As we plow through our daily routines — running to meetings, rushing through problem sets, cramming for tests — we become trapped in a state of inertia, running ourselves down to the point of exhaustion.
So, for a minute or two, let’s stop sprinting. We need to be there for one other, not running away from each other.
During the pandemic, we experienced what it felt like to be without our support systems and without people to confide in. Some of us remain scarred from the personal battles that we endured during this lonely period of time. But now, we’re together again; and we must all be present, both physically and emotionally, to help each other heal.
With on-campus mental health services like Harvard Counseling and Mental Health Services consistently falling short, the most accessible individuals to whom we can lament our mental health struggles are fellow Harvard community members. For the time being, the work has fallen on us to assume the role of unofficial mental health advocates.
This doesn’t mean that we can solve Harvard's mental health crisis on our own. It means that we must simultaneously hold Harvard accountable for its lack of investment in mental health support initiatives — for instance, by demanding that we get more from our grossly under-resourced Counseling and Mental Health Services — while genuinely investing in one another as we fight for such reform.
Standing together as a community to create a more compassionate one is, in fact, a legitimate form of activism. On a regular basis, we can make sure that our friends feel valued. Some may not want to share what they’re going through, but we can still make their eyes brighter and their insides warmer.
So in all of our relationships — peer-to-peer, student-to-professor, Crimson-editor-to-Crimson-editor — let’s reach out and revel in providing the support we couldn’t virtually. Let’s not only send silence packing, but speak louder about how we want our revitalized campus community to prioritize our own and each other’s well-being.

Amherst College’s recent decision to abolish its legacy admissions has justifiably been met with cheerful enthusiasm. The college’s president finally admitted that the long-standing practice of giving preference to children of alumni in admissions “limits educational opportunity,” even as the dean of admissions declared that the college wanted to be a leader “in policies and programs that support access and equality.”
Amherst’s decision puts it on a small but growing list of elite private colleges (MIT, Caltech, Pomona, and Johns Hopkins also no longer have legacy preference in admissions) that do not give children of alumni an unfair leg up during the admissions process. In light of this, we are all perhaps thinking about the same perennial question: How long before Harvard decides to do the same?
Amherst’s move is a welcome step toward making higher education more accessible at a time when inequality has been rising for over three decades. Private colleges continue to remain the prerogative of the rich in the US — 38 colleges, including Yale and Princeton, admit more students from the top one percent than the entire bottom 60 percent of America’s income distribution. Harvard economist Raj Chetty has found that children whose parents are in the top one percent of income distribution are 77 times more likely to attend an Ivy League college compared to those whose parents are in the bottom quintile.
Legacy admissions is a big part of this inequality problem. A study of 30 elite US colleges from 2011 found that students whose parents graduated from the college were 45 percent more likely to be admitted compared to students without a legacy background. At Harvard, the acceptance rate for legacy students was 33 percent between 2014 and 2019 even though the overall acceptance rate during the same period was less than 6 percent. Most legacy students tend to be white and come from very privileged backgrounds — let’s face it, these students do not need any additional advantage in the admissions process.
Colleges usually make the argument that legacy admissions help in securing crucial donations from alumni, which can then be used to fund financial aid initiatives for low-income students. But empirical studies have shown that there is no meaningful correlation between legacy preference in admissions and alumni giving at top schools in the country.
Some have also argued that legacy admissions is important to maintain a sense of community within the institution. Lawrence H. Summers, a former Harvard president, has called legacy admissions “integral ​​to the kind of community that any private educational institution is.” But this kind of talk carries little weight, and in any case, does not justify unfairly privileging legacy students over deserving students from other backgrounds.
This year, Harvard’s endowment soared to $53.2 billion in the midst of a devastating pandemic. The University also ran a budget surplus of $283 million in the last fiscal year that ended in June 2021. No other higher education institution in the world comes even close to matching the vast amount of financial resources Harvard has at its disposal. As such, it is unreasonable for Harvard to continue to privilege legacy students in its admissions process. Giving advantage to children of alumni goes against the meritocratic spirit and impedes social mobility. Instead of entrenching already existing inequality, an institution like Harvard should commit more resources to promoting equity and democratizing higher education.
Harvard alumni can play an important role in ensuring that Harvard adopts a fairer admissions system. All Harvard alumni should have an interest in seeing a more just admissions process, and as such, they need to put pressure on Harvard to end its legacy admissions. This could be accomplished through efforts like “Leave Your Legacy,” a national campaign that aims to bring alumni together to pledge against donating to universities with legacy admissions. The alumni should take a decisive stand against the unethical practice of legacy preference that mostly harms first-generation, low-income, and nonwhite students. If Harvard alumni collectively decide to withhold donations to the university until the abolition of legacy admissions, the university will have little choice but to end the unfair admissions policy.
Private universities like Harvard continue to remain the bastions of elitism in a world that celebrates meritocracy and upward social mobility. There is a long way to go before we can make higher education truly accessible, but ending legacy preferences in admissions is a good step in that direction. Harvard should therefore follow Amherst’s lead and abolish its legacy admissions or it will soon find itself on the wrong side of history.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I first realized that my birthday was on a Saturday this year, I panicked.
Having a birthday so early on in the school year is both a blessing and a curse, especially freshman year — not enough time for the workload to get too tough yet just enough time for everyone to get into their rhythm academically and, more dauntingly, socially. Making friends is already a difficult endeavor with such a large pool of people, each diverse in their own way. The pressure to do so quickly and effortlessly makes the process even harder.
Thus, in the first few weeks of school, I resigned myself to the fact that I probably would not spend my birthday surrounded by the familiar faces and easy laughter as I was typically used to. There was the knowledge that this was my first birthday without my family and friends, and then there was the fear that I would force myself to make plans that I wouldn’t even enjoy. I took a risk and made such plans anyway.
I can’t say for sure if my risk paid off. On one hand, it was a beautiful day with wonderful people I had just met. On the other hand, I couldn’t help but feel that they were all enjoying the day more than I was and my mind kept drifting back to better ways I could have been spending my time, even if that meant doing homework alone in my room on my birthday weekend.
There is nothing that makes one feel more misplaced than being physically with a group but mentally elsewhere.
I think we are all familiar with the third-person-on-the-sidewalk phenomenon: when you are walking with two other friends but are being pushed aside, literally or figuratively, off the sidewalk and onto the grass. But typically when I walk in the grass, it is on someone else’s street, somewhere I had already entertained the possibility of feeling like an outsider peering in. Yet at the beginning of this semester, I was walking in the grass on my own block.
I felt disoriented in the setting I not only chose to be in here at Harvard, but actively orchestrated for myself. As much as I knew it wasn’t true, I couldn’t help but feel that everyone else was more everything than I could be — smarter, cooler, more adaptive — and I felt silly for even hoping for a chance in their company. At least for me, it was this insecurity alone that usually pushed me onto the grass.
But fortunately, throughout the past two months of transitioning to college, I have slowly found my way back onto the sidewalk. Though I came in expecting to be constantly bombarded with the fear of not being enough to form friendships, in a seemingly contradictory way, the sheer range of amazing talents and personalities has actually soothed me as they are almost always coupled with humility and genuinity. I am grateful that I have distanced myself from the feelings that followed me around on my birthday and have come to accept that I am capable of being liked for simply being myself, even if it took me a while to get there.
In one word, this atmosphere is refreshing. The beauty of Harvard, in my eyes, is that I have not just found a group of people that I feel included in, but several.
The downside to so many amazing opportunities to connect is that I find myself struggling to balance and maintain my place in each group, so much so that I am afraid of not belonging with any of them.
The “FOMO” culture was present before we even stepped on campus — the Class of 2025 organized its own pre-orientation program, the First-Year Open Multidisciplinary Orientation or “F.O.M.O.,” in an attempt to mitigate students’ fear of being left out. Many of my classmates still express their discomfort with the intense social demands of some clubs. I realized the burden of FOMO the most during the recent midterms cycle. I felt a twinge of guilt — not surprisingly — every time I turned down an invitation but surprisingly, also a burst of relief. The constant social upkeep had effectively drained me and I was silently very grateful for some time for just myself. Now, to intentionally escape the pressure, I sometimes opt to walk in the grass. There are days that I simply say no, even if I’m free, because I believe that time could be better spent alone.
I feel like prioritizing time alone over superfluous social preening is something that is mostly stigmatized if not completely overlooked. Sometimes, the place where you belong is not with others but with yourself, and that is not only normal but healthy and necessary. I am still trying to navigate where I want to fit into the Harvard social bubble and how to ensure that I don’t let myself get lost in the process.
I hope to get to a point where I don’t think twice about what day of the week my birthday falls on, only about what I wish to do to make my own heart content, whether that’s strolling on the sidewalk or reveling in the grass.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
William V. Giannobile, the dean of the Harvard School of Dental Medicine, lauded the school’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, said he hopes to strengthen efforts to promote diversity and inclusion in the HSDM student body, and discussed the impact of Covid-19 on oral health care in a Monday interview.
The Dental School’s active engagement in clinical care and small class size have lent themselves well to in-person learning throughout the course of the pandemic, according to Giannobile. The school hosted third and fourth-year dental students in-person for pre-clinical and limited clinical education beginning July 6, 2020, with a full campus return in January 2021.
Giannobile, who started as dean of HSDM in September 2020, also noted that HSDM has maintained a “very good track record” of Covid-19 cases since its on-campus reopening, and commended the Dental School’s use of contact tracing and adherence to public health guidelines.
Giannobile said that, as the school regroups following the pandemic, he hopes to prioritize action on diversity and inclusion initiatives.
Among those priorities is the Dental School’s ongoing search for a new dean for diversity, inclusion, and belonging, as well as expanding that role, according to Giannobile.
In January, the Dental School also established a new student scholarship called the Freeman, Grant, Franklin Scholarship to support underrepresented students in dentistry.
The scholarship was named after three African-American HSDM alumni: Robert Tanner Freeman, the first African-American in the U.S. to graduate from a dental school; George Franklin Grant, the first African-American faculty member at Harvard; and Dolores Mercedes Franklin, the first African-American woman to graduate from HSDM.
The scholarship was funded by a $210,000 gift from Colgate-Palmolive Company in January.
The school is also focusing on admissions efforts targeting potential African-American and Latinx students.
This year, the dental school’s class is 69 percent women and 31 percent men; one-third of students are from backgrounds that are underrepresented in dentistry.
“This year is our most diverse class,” he asserted.
Giannobile also highlighted the impact of Covid-19 on dental care at Harvard and Cambridge.
When Giannobile was first appointed Dean of HSDM, Harvard Dental Service — which is managed by Harvard University Health Services — had announced its closing due to financial pressures exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic.
During the pandemic, Giannobile sought to reopen the clinic to ensure that those needing dental health care could receive care. The Dental School acquired the clinic from HUHS and reopened it as the Harvard Dental Center in February.
Giannobile said that fears surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic have led to delays in dental care among the general population and a consequent exacerbation of oral health problems.
“There’s such a fear that we understand that we’ve all had with the pandemic and Covid infection, and people have really been so cautious that many urgent medical needs have not been addressed,” he said.
To address this concern, Giannobile said the Dental School hopes to promote a “closer integration” between medicine and dentistry.
“The head is connected to the rest of the body,” he said. “And there’s so many aspects of oral health that affect whole body health.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Undergraduate Council passed legislation to officially stand behind Harvard graduate student workers ahead of a potential strike and to extend funds to support financial aid-eligible students’ printing and laundry costs.
The first act releases an official statement by Tuesday in solidarity with Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers, which plans to strike for three days beginning Wednesday if its demands in contract negotiations are not met.
“The Harvard Undergraduate Council supports these demands and cares about the well-being of graduate student workers,” the legislation reads.
The statement itself notes that graduate students “serve a crucial role in the undergraduate educational experience.”
“We are acutely aware of the time and effort they invest into students,” the statement reads.
The statement reads that the current benefits graduate students receive are “inconsistent” with their workloads, and that HGSU-UAW’s demands are “intertwined” with the needs of undergraduate student hourly workers. Undergraduate research assistants are represented by the graduate student union.
The UC, by passing its statement, threw its support behind HGSU-UAW’s calls for independent arbitration for discrimination and sexual harassment complaints, alongside an increase in compensation and benefits.
In a Friday interview, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said there is “good will on every side to get to a resolution,” but the College is conducting contingency planning to avoid academic impacts.
The act to pass the statement was sponsored by Lowell House Representative LyLena D. Estabine ’24 and Pforzheimer House Representative Shreya P. Nair ’24 and was passed 40-0-0.
The second piece of legislation allocates $10,000 to subsidize printing and laundry for undergraduates. The printing and laundry subsidy program was established in the 2019-20 academic year to support low-income students who may be burdened by these expenses.
“A printing and laundry subsidy was piloted in both AY 19-20 and AY 20-21 successfully, and was well-received by students according to subsequent feedback,” the legislation reads.
As a result, the UC will continue the program this semester, providing subsidies for up to 500 students in the College — 200 freshmen, 100 sophomores, 100 juniors, and 100 seniors.
Students who express interest in the program will be entered into a lottery to be among those 500 students, who will receive a $20 subsidy in their Crimson Cash accounts.
The legislation was sponsored by 17 representatives, including both freshmen and upperclassmen.
Also on Sunday, the UC passed a bill to publish a statement advocating for the Smith Campus Center to return to being open 24 hours a day.
“Smith Campus Centre is the most important shared study space for Harvard students, as a purpose-built space for effective studying,” the legislation reads.
The legislation was sponsored by Crimson Yard Representative Ethan C. Kelly ’25 and Dunster House Representative Samuel H. Taylor ’24.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the threat of a three-day graduate student strike looms over campus, labor experts said it is fairly common for unions to strike for short periods.
After months of stagnating negotiations and a membership vote overwhelmingly in favor of a strike, the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers threatened two weeks ago to go on strike. If the University does not move toward the union’s demands by Oct. 27, the strike will start Wednesday morning and continue through Friday, coinciding with freshman parents weekend.
The impending strike will be significantly shorter than the student workers’ previous strike — when they picketed for 29 days in Dec. 2019 — and the dining hall workers’ 22-day strike in 2o16. Though short strikes are thus unfamiliar to Harvard in recent years, experts say they are common across industries.
“Strikes historically in higher ed have been relatively short over time,” said William A. Herbert, executive director of the National Center for the Study of Collective Bargaining in Higher Education and the Professions at Hunter College, City University of New York.
William B. Gould IV, former chairman of the National Labor Relations Board, noted that strikes are trending shorter.
“Unions have, in recent years, resorted increasingly to strikes of shorter duration,” Gould said, explaining that the loss of pay over an indefinite strike can be immense.
From 2010 through 2020, more than 55 percent of strikes of a thousand or more workers lasted seven days or fewer, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
A few weeks ago Harvard and HGSU-UAW engaged a federal mediator in their negotiations — the same mediator who helped the two parties reach their first contract last year. The union and the University will meet Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday. If the strike does occur, the two parties will communicate throughout it, according to Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton.
Newton wrote in a previous emailed statement that the University believes a strike is “unwarranted” given progress in mediation.
The union and University remain far apart on a few key issues, chief among them increased compensation and benefits, third party arbitration for discrimination and harassment cases, and agency shop, which would require all students workers represented by HGSU-UAW to pay fees to the union.
The union hopes its strike threat will push the University to meet its demands, according to HGSU-UAW President Brandon J. Mancilla.
“They do not want to adequately pay their graduate students,” Mancilla said in an interview Monday. “They do not want to make real structural reforms to their Title IX process. But it’s not up to them wanting to — it’s us demanding and trying to force them to.”
Unlike the union’s strike in 2019, which took place during the fall semester’s reading period and finals, Mancilla said the upcoming strike is designed to disrupt teaching instead of grading.
Herbert, the expert on collective bargaining, called the impending strike “credible.”
“In this case, I believe a very large vote in favor of striking makes it clear that the strike is imminent and that it has support among the graduate student workers,” he said.
In preparation for the strike, Harvard Director of Labor and Employee Relations Paul Curran emailed all student workers represented by HGSU-UAW Monday, notifying them that Harvard will ask them to self-report their participation in a strike so the University can adjust compensation accordingly.
Herbert said he is not familiar with universities asking student workers to report their own strike activities, adding other universities have typically relied on supervisors to sort out payrolls.
On the eve of the strike, Herbert said that HGSU-UAW’s success could depend on how supportive students and faculty are of the union’s cause. He added the federal mediator will play a critical role in reaching an agreement.
“My guess is right now that there’s going to be a lot of meetings taking place, a lot of back and forth between the parties and the mediator on the outstanding issues between now and the day the strike is supposed to begin,” Herbert said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Graduate Council members mulled the potential impacts of reinstating shopping week and as well as an imminent three-day strike by the University’s graduate student union during a public meeting Monday.
Consistent with previous meetings, the meeting was held at one of the twelve graduate schools — the rotation falling this time on the Dental School — with the option of Harvard affiliates joining virtually via Zoom.
Matthew R. “Matt” Volpe, a HGC liaison for the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers, said it appears “likely” that union members will move forward with a three-day strike come Wednesday. Prior to a potential strike, however, two bargaining sessions with the University are scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday, per Volpe.
“Based on the lawyer’s attitude — the lawyer that Harvard hires — it seems likely that we will probably go on strike on Wednesday,” he said. “But there is the possibility that we could call for further actions if there is still no movement at the bargaining table after that.”
In the current negotiations, union members are advocating for increased financial and counseling resources for students navigating the University’s Title IX program. The union’s demands include increasing professional support for Title IX complainants and changing hearing panel makeups from a majority of Harvard faculty, according t0 Volpe.
“One of the things we want to see is just that that panel instead be majority third-party individuals,” he said. “We recognize that when faculty members are making decisions about other faculty members, it can introduce some conflicts of interest.”
Attendees also addressed the potential for a reinstatement of shopping week — a period at the beginning of the semesters when students can test out classes before enrolling — on graduate student employment. HGC Chair of Advocacy Xavier I. Sayeed said members of the University’s committee on course registration are “leaning toward” an early enrollment process.
“There are some concerns that have been voiced that shopping week — and the way that it’s been conducted in the past — makes [graduate student teaching fellows’] employment unpredictable until the last minute, or sometimes they’ve been asked to teach sections for classes that end up being more full than anticipated,” he said.
Sayeed noted that the Undergraduate Council recently created a document claiming that Faculty of Arts and Sciences policies, as opposed to shopping week itself, are largely responsible for issues surrounding graduate student pay.
“The problem with graduate student pay owes to FAS’ current budgetary policies, which force graduate students to secure unpredictable, underpaid teaching assignments in order to make basic ends meet, not the decades-old tradition of Shopping Week,” the document reads.
William L. Qian, a Computer Science graduate student in attendance, said he believes shopping week would not have a significant impact on teaching fellow appointments.
“I think the undergrads are right that shopping week doesn’t materially affect TF appointments because TF appointments are adjusted throughout the semester, mostly due to the fact that Harvard’s add-drop date is very late,” he said.
“Even if Harvard got rid of shopping week, undergrads would still create their own version of shopping week, simply by dropping classes and adding classes,” Qian added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick ’78 shared his insights into what it takes to be a great leader in the face of political divisiveness at the JFK Jr. Forum on Monday.
Patrick — now a senior advisor at Bain Capital and one of three co-chairs of the bipartisan Future of Technology Commision — reflected on how his upbringing impacted his leadership style and discussed how to push back against challenges to democracy.
Patrick, a Democrat, began by detailing his childhood in Chicago’s South Side, and how the social support that the country provided him afforded him confidence in the United States.
“There were food stamps when we were hungry and affordable housing when we needed shelter, there were well prepared and loving teachers in those public classrooms, grants, and affordable student loan for college, an economy expanding to make room for me when I was ready and a reliable bus or subway to get me to that job, and home again safely. I am the symbol and the result of my grandmother's faith in America,” he said. “I owe it to her to be a patriot."
Patrick reflected on significant moments in his tenure in the State House, including the bombing of the Boston Marathon in 2013.
In the aftermath of the Boston Marathon, Patrick said he worked to contend with “grief and righteous anger.”
“I tried to balance our grief and righteous anger with the need to keep the community together positive and facing forward,” Patrick said. After the attack, he said he also tried to evoke the spirit of patriotism.
“True patriotism, it seems to me, is about national aspiration,” he said.
Patrick also reflected on a fraught choice he made in 2014, when then-President Barack Obama’s administration requested states offer shelter to minors who crossed the border alone. He received both praise and criticism after his eventual decision to offer up two sites in Massachusetts to house the children.
Patrick acknowledged the multitude of threats to democracy in the United States, such as partisan gerrymandering, restrictive voting laws, and the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol in January 2021.
He urged young people to turn out to vote and stay engaged between elections in order to hold their elected officials accountable.
“If American democracy is to have a chance, more of us have better summon up our own patriotism,” Patrick said.
Azeez S. Richardson ’25 said he cherished the event, which was part of the Seymour E. and Ruth B. Harris Lecture Series.
“Once I found out that Deval Patrick was speaking, I knew that I had to be here,” Richardson said. “His speech gave us clarity on how best to approach crises from not just a policy or political perspective but also from a moral or mental perspective.”
J. Benjamin “Ben” Romero — a first year at the Harvard Kennedy School — said he enjoyed Patrick’s commentary on patriotism.
“For me, hearing the reclaiming of the term patriot, that has been reduced to flag waving and reduced to pure symbolism, rather than the actual difficult challenge of being a patriot — which is building institutions that last, which is advocating for justice for everyone — was pretty moving,” Romero said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a bargaining session a week before its Wednesday strike deadline, Harvard’s graduate student union conceded its demand for third-party arbitration of gender- and sex-based harassment and discrimination claims — a sticking point since negotiations began for the union’s first contract in 2018.
“Given the university’s intransigence, we have conceded on our demand that Title IX cases be able to be brought to an arbitrator,” union leadership announced in an email to membership Friday.
Instead, the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers will continue to push the University to help pay for lawyers for student workers undergoing the Title IX process, the email continued. It is also demanding that hearings and appeals panels for Title IX complaints be composed of a majority of third-party individuals.
Thus far, the University has rejected both proposals, according to the union. Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment Monday.
HGSU-UAW’s concession comes after years of fighting for third-party arbitration to handle all identity-based discrimination and sexual harassment complaints. The union went on strike in 2019 in part over these demands and, when its first contract did not include independent arbitration for such cases, vowed to continue organizing around the issue.
As recently as September, union members rallied for independent arbitration for all cases of discrimination and harassment.
HGSU-UAW President Brandon J. Mancilla said in an interview Monday that the compromise will allow the union to pursue other priorities during this round of negotiations.
“We still agree that as a union, we deserve to have third-party arbitration for all issues and cases of harassment or discrimination, but in this specific fight, I think that’s one that we are willing to move on in order to get the others,” Mancilla said.
HGSU-UAW is holding firm, however, to its longstanding demand that complaints other than those of gender- and sex-based harassment and discrimination be able to be brought before a third-party arbitrator, Mancilla added.
In late August, the University offered an appeals process that could result in third-party arbitration for cases of non-Title IX discrimination and harassment — the first time Harvard opened the possibility of third-party arbitration for any identity-based complaints.
The University has long maintained, however, that allowing student workers to pursue Title IX or other gender-based complaints through mechanisms not available to other students would violate federal regulations.
William A. Herbert, executive director of the National Center for the Study of Collective Bargaining in Higher Education and the Professions at Hunter College, City University of New York, said the union’s compromise is “significant.”
“From following this from afar, it’s appeared over time that this is a major issue in negotiations, so the fact that [the union] would be agreeable to arbitrate the discrimination issues and withdraw the Title IX issues will be helpful to reach an agreement,” Herbert said. “I think it is an important breakthrough on both sides.”
On Oct. 19, Professor Ajantha Subramanian shared a letter signed by dozens of faculty members supporting the union’s efforts to find alternative solutions to the University’s current Title IX process.
“We, the undersigned members of the Harvard faculty, endorse HGSU-UAW’s demand for ‘real recourse,’” the statement reads. “We agree with the union that Harvard’s existing mechanisms and resources for addressing sex and gender-based misconduct do not ensure the safety and well-being of its members.”
Margaret G. Czerwienski, an HGSU-UAW member who spoke at the September rally, said Monday the union’s decision to concede did not come as a huge surprise. Nonetheless, she said she believes the union’s current proposals would make a “tremendous impact” and preserve the “principles” of third-party arbitration.
“The Bargaining Committee communicated extensively with those of us who had been through the process, and they were really invested in hearing about our experiences and getting our opinion on what kinds of changes would actually produce meaningful results for people going through the process,” she said.
If HGSU-UAW goes on strike, Czerwienski added she will be on the picket line calling for the University to meet the union in the middle on non-discrimination procedures.
“I think the union made a huge concession to the University,” she said. “[HGSU-UAW] made two reasonable asks — putting third-party people on panels costs [Harvard] nothing. These are very reasonable asks to make the process more fair. I don’t see any reason why the University shouldn’t meet us halfway.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Saturday afternoon was supposed to be about the clash of two football powers at Powers Field in Princeton, N.J. The 2021 Ivy League title hung in the balance as the two leading schools in the conference standings fought tooth and nail for every yard and every first down. A crowd of 10,003 sought to culminate Princeton’s homecoming festivities with an epic, competitive battle between No. 17/22 Princeton (5-0, 2-0 Ivy) and No. 16/RV Harvard (5-0, 2-0 Ivy). Yet at the end of the four-hour, five-overtime clash, football fans’ focus lay not with those in black and orange, relishing their victory, nor with those in crimson and white, who put up a valiant effort in defeat, but with those in black and white whose procedural error negated what should have been Tim Murphy’s 184th win at the helm of the Crimson.
The Tigers walked away from the game 6-0, finally emerging with the win after quarterback Cole Smith found wide receiver Jacob Bermilen in the back of the end zone in the fifth overtime period. Meanwhile, Harvard traveled back to Cambridge with a record of 5-1, convinced — rightly, as it turned out based on the Ivy League’s Sunday announcement — that it had won the contest with a quick slant from senior quarterback Jake Smith to junior wide receiver Kym Wimberly in the third overtime.
After the first two overtime drives for each team failed to produce a winner, Princeton began its drive at the three-yard line. It would be given one attempt to convert a two-point conversion and, if it succeeded and the Crimson failed to match, it would win the game. When senior linebacker Jack McGowan broke up Cole Smith’s pass, Harvard had the opportunity to come out on top with a conversion. Offensive coordinator Mickey Fein dialed up a play and trotted his offense out onto the field.
“The plan was to get the ball to [Wimberly] on the in-breaking route because of the no safety look,” explained Jake Smith when reached via text message.
Wimberly came down with the ball near the back of the end zone, and Princeton Stadium erupted. Thousands of Tigers fans fell silent as the smaller Crimson contingent on the opposite side of the field rejoiced. The Harvard sideline quickly emptied as players sprinted onto the field to mob their wide receiver and celebrate their victory. With players from both teams still on the field, officials announced that the play would be subject to an official review.
A few minutes later, with the stadium still buzzing, officials walked back out onto the field to announce their findings. While Wimberly had come down in bounds for a successful conversion, Princeton head coach Bob Surace had called a timeout before the ball was snapped, and referees had decided to grant the timeout despite only noticing it during the replay review. There was a collective cheer from Tigers fans as the Crimson offense trotted back out to the three-yard line to try it again.
“After Princeton was granted the timeout, I was very upset and confused,” Jake Smith wrote. “You can’t grant a timeout after a play has been carried out.”
According to Rule 12, Section 3 of the National Collegiate Athletic Association’s (NCAA) official rulebook, there are a wide variety of plays that are reviewable by the replay official. Because Wimberly’s catch was ruled a completed pass in the end zone and a scoring play, the review itself was completely legal. However, the rulebook stipulates in Rule 3, Section 3 that timeouts may only be requested “between the time the ball is declared dead and the next snap.” However, for a timeout request to be honored, the referee must grant it with a signal — no official did this prior to the snap. Timeouts are not listed among reviewable game decisions in Rule 12, Section 3.
Harvard scored on its second attempt as well, with Jake Smith completing a pass to senior wide receiver BJ Watson. However, Watson was flagged for offensive pass interference on the play, setting the Crimson back 15 yards. On its third try, it was unable to find the end zone as Jake Smith’s pass to sophomore tight end Haven Montefalco was broken up by Princeton linebacker Jeremiah Tyler.
“[We] had it won once… had it won twice… still, the most bizarre thing I’ve ever seen in my life,” Murphy said after the game.
The next morning, the Ivy League released a statement, in which it acknowledged that “the timeout should not have been granted and the play should have resulted in a successful two-point conversion,” but maintained that “the outcome of the game [would] stand as a win for Princeton.”
The announcement was heavily criticized by some Crimson players, who believed that the result should have been overturned.
“The announcement yesterday did provide [a] little satisfaction in knowing that the public now knows we won that game,” wrote first-year tight end Tyler Neville in a text message. “It also [aggravates] me more than anything because they are admitting that we won the game but will do nothing about it.”
There is no precedent for the NCAA overturning the result of a completed game. In one infamous 2015 game between Duke and the University of Miami, a seemingly miraculous 75-yard kickoff return featuring eight laterals that won Miami the game turned out to be fraught with officiating errors. The next day, Duke head coach David Cutliffe protested for the results to be overturned, but the NCAA has no procedure in place for reversing a game’s outcomes. Afterward, the Atlantic Coast Conference suspended the Duke-Miami referees for two league games.
The one game that saw its results change also took place between two Ivy League rivals, Cornell and Dartmouth, in 1940. In that game, Dartmouth held a 3-0 lead when the Big Red earned a fresh set of downs at the six-yard line. Although the Big Green managed a stop, referee Red Friesell lost track of what down it was and granted the Big Red what he thought was a fourth-down play from the six-yard line. After Cornell scored the game-winning touchdown, on the “fifth down,” Friesell’s mistake was discovered, and while the Eastern Intercollegiate Football Association (EIFA) could not overturn the result, the Big Red decided to forfeit the game and grant the Big Green a 3-0 victory. As far as the modern Ivy League and NCAA are concerned, there is no historical record of the NCAA reversing a game’s outcome because no option to do so exists within its rulebook.
On Monday afternoon, the Harvard Director of Athletics, Erin McDermott, released a statement, stating that the school was “extremely disappointed in the outcome of the football game due to a major officiating error” but that “we stand with the Ivy League and understand there is no recourse to determine a different result.”
So, Harvard has no choice but to regroup before Dartmouth visits on Oct. 30. The Big Green, who also enter the game with a 5-1 record after losing to Columbia on Friday night, oppose the Crimson in the middle game of Harvard’s series against its primary rivals for the conference title, which culminates on Nov. 6 in New York City against the 5-1 Columbia Lions. Harvard is still in contention for the Ivy League championship although a Crimson title would require a Tigers loss. If multiple teams finish with a 7-1 conference record, those teams would share the conference title since the Ancient Eight currently has no tiebreaker procedures for football.
Murphy expressed confidence after the game that, despite the heartbreaking ending, the Crimson would play with motivation against Dartmouth. Neville, who led the team with 58 receiving yards on four catches on Saturday, was quick to back up his coach’s assertion.
“We will be taking our anger out on Dartmouth,” he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard fell to Ivy League leaders Princeton at home on Saturday evening by a score of 4-1. After a steady first-half performance from the Crimson, the Tigers came alive in the second half, scoring three goals in eight minutes to earn the victory.
After battling for the opening 50 minutes and controlling the majority of that period, Harvard (5-5-3, 0-2-2, Ivy) crumbled in the second half versus Princeton (8-5, 4-0 Ivy) to suffer its heaviest defeat of the season. The Crimson is still looking for its first Ivy League victory of the 2021 campaign despite at times dominating the top three teams of the Ancient Eight.
“I thought we created a lot of wonderful opportunities in the first half,” said coach Josh Shapiro of the match. “We have the ability to play really good soccer, and you have to earn that by doing that work defensively, doing that gritty battling work, and that is coming and going for us.”
The Tigers came into the matchup boasting the best defensive record in the Ivy League, conceding an even twelve goals through twelve games, while the Crimson entered the matchup with the third-best offense in the Ancient Eight, averaging 1.83 goals per game.
Harvard lived up to this high offensive standard early on in the match, creating chance after chance in the opening twenty minutes but failing to convert for the opening goal. The best of these chances came in the 20th minute when first-year forward Alessandro Arlotti found himself in acres of space in front of the Princeton goal, but the Monaco native struck wide.
The Tigers settled into the game after Arlotti’s chance, instantly hitting back and nearly scoring just a minute later. Sophomore defender Nik White lost his footing while running down Princeton’s striker in the 21st minute and landed on the ball, inadvertently handling the ball, which then fell to the striker, who then struck wide.
The Tigers’ bench erupted with protests, calling for a red card for White, who was the Crimson’s last defender, but the referee was unconvinced, awarding only a yellow card and a free kick from the spot of the foul on the edge of the box, which was subsequently missed by Princeton. The chance marked the end of Harvard’s early dominance as the Tigers began to pressure the Crimson’s goal for the next quarter of an hour.
Harvard stayed resilient on defense under this pressure and was rewarded with a goal at the other end in the 38th minute. Senior midfielder Nico Garcia-Morillo created the chance with a strong slide tackle on Princeton’s right back, winning the ball and sliding it centrally to Arlotti. Arlotti could have taken the shot but smartly moved the ball wide to senior midfielder Cornelius Bencsik, who found himself in tons of space, finishing coolly into the far corner with a curling effort to put the Crimson up 1-0. The goal was Bencsik’s second in two games and his fourth on the season.
While the lead was deserved, it did not last long for Harvard, with the Tigers levelling under two minutes later. After just a few moments of play, Princeton won a corner and smashed in a header on the ensuing cross, levelling the game at 1-1 in the 40th minute.
After a hard-fought, back-and-forth first half, the second half was all Princeton, with the Tigers putting the game to bed in the first fifteen minutes of the second half. This was mostly due to the individual contribution of senior forward Kevin O’Toole, who scored nearly identical goals in the 53rd and 57th minutes, cutting in from the right wing to find space near the corner of the box and curling the ball into the far corner to beat junior goalkeeper Oskar Nilsson twice in under five minutes.
Princeton put the game beyond all doubt in the 61st minute when it was awarded a potentially controversial penalty kick after first-year defender Jan Riecke was penalized for a push on an attacker just inside the box. O’Toole stepped up and converted the kick to complete his eight-minute hat trick and seal the game.
“We have to get through some of these lapses that are there that are hurting us, but I'm so excited to fight for the rest of the season, to be as competitive as we can and make as much progress as we can as a team,” said Shapiro of the team’s remaining games.
Harvard now hosts Dartmouth this Saturday at Jordan Field, with kickoff set for 4 p.m.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following five fierce wins in its 2021 season, the Harvard women’s rugby team (5-1, Ivy 1-1) suffered its first defeat against Dartmouth (6-0, Ivy 2-0) on Saturday. The Big Green came out strong and fast right off the first whistle and was able to quell all future Crimson momentum in a 45-31 victory.
Taking advantage of holes in Harvard’s defense, Dartmouth dominated possession for most of the first half, jumping out to a 26-0 lead. Right before the half, however, senior wing Emma Kearney saw a huge run that led to a try from fellow senior wing Sabrina Kim. The Crimson managed to trim the deficit to 26-5 before the intermission, allowing the team to enter halftime with a new sense of confidence.
“We had some momentum right before the half, and then we were able to regroup at the half,” senior prop/lock Erica Jarrell said. “I think that's really all we needed to get over that hump. The nature of rugby with no stoppages or anything… if something doesn't go your way, things can just kind of snowball really fast, especially with a young team.”
While the opponent entered Harvard’s try zone within the first minute of the second half, the Crimson was able to remember the adjustments discussed at halftime and respond with a momentum shift. Down 38-5 at the 48-minute mark, Harvard appeared undeterred, and the team saw three unanswered tries, culminating in 19 points.
“We played a really, really, really strong second half,” emphasized senior wing Emma Kearney, who notched two back-to-back tries. “We narrowed the score from that first half to the second half. We were proud that we were able to mentally make that switch from being down.”
While the momentum shift in Harvard’s favor was not enough to change the outcome, the team looks at this loss optimistically.
“I think honestly, I'm grateful for it,” Jarrell reflected. “It's a lot more intimidating to be at the top of a mountain — this undefeated and sort of unchallenged team… It's kind of refreshing to sort of be on the other side of that. We just go back to the drawing board and get some high-quality data on what we actually need to work on.”
The Harvard-Dartmouth rivalry is one of the most prominent in the league, coming from two teams that historically lead the rankings and draw from top talent from across the country. It has remained steady the past five years, with the teams continuously hoping to edge the other in both the regular season, the Ivy League, and the NIRA playoffs.
While Dartmouth was victorious this time, in their previous matchup on Nov. 9, 2019, it was Harvard who was crowned NIRA champions following a thrilling 23-22 win over the Big Green in the semifinals and an 18-7 victory over Army in the title game. That same season, Harvard had bested Dartmouth in the regular season before falling in the Ivy League Championship and then redeeming itself in the NIRA semifinals. Thus, in 2019, the Crimson took two of three from the Big Green, and this season too, rematches could be in store.
The parity in the rivalry extends back beyond the 2019 season. Dartmouth and Harvard are 3-3 in their past six matchups spanning back to 2018, with neither team able to notch the pair of accolades at the same time in the past two seasons: both times the Ivys and NIRA championships have been split between the two schools.
Both Jarrell and Kearney have seen the growth of this rivalry since their first-year seasons. Continuously vying for triumph, the matchups are eagerly anticipated each year.
“It's really cool to be able to have such an intense rivalry and then also have mutual respect,” Kearney remarked.
Jarell seconded the sentiment, saying, “We are each other's greatest motivation and greatest challenge every season.”
Eager to get back on the field, the Crimson squad is setting its sights on the next challenge.
“We can play with this really good team, and the second half was ours,” Kearney said. “What really matters is going forward. We’re really excited about how we played even though the outcome isn't what we wanted.”
Looking ahead, Harvard (5-1) will face Army (5-1) this Saturday, Oct. 30, on Mignone Field at 12 p.m. to close out the regular season.
