In a surprise release, Harry Styles dropped his latest single “Watermelon Sugar” on Nov. 16 — just before performing the song on Saturday Night Live. The single, produced by Tyler Johnson and Kid Harpoon, is the second off Styles’s album “Fine Line,” released Dec. 13. Styles hinted at the track back in October, tweeting, “Kiwi walked so Watermelon Sugar could run,”and provoking several questions. The first: What is it with Harry Styles and green fruit? (Unless you consider watermelon red.) The second: What kind of rock banger does Harry have planned next? Despite its prominent electric guitar line, “Watermelon Sugar” deviates far from “Kiwi’’’s aggressive rock vibe. Even so, “Watermelon Sugar” is a compelling groove liable to induce an earworm on the second or third listen.
There is only one thing more relaxing than sitting outdoors in the evening whilst being engulfed by comforting summer air: simultaneously having sweet berries to gorge on. Styles etches this feeling into the mind with the combination of his isolated vocals along with electric keyboard and a familiar electric guitar rhythmic strum (“Tastes like strawberries on a summer evenin' / And it sounds just like a song / I want more berries and that summer feelin' / It's so wonderful and warm”). His informal elisions convey a laid-back and effortless energy that divulges into a sincere longing for intimacy in the pre-chorus (“Breathe me in, breathe me out / I don't know if I could ever go without”).
A cascade of musical escalation — the addition of a mixed beat, funky electric guitar, involved bass line, upper register harmonies, and strumming acoustic guitar — culminates in a groovy, electric bass-dependent track set to the words of the chorus: “Watermelon sugar high.” “Watermelon Sugar” is thought to be a reference to Richard Brautigan’s 1968 novel “In Watermelon Sugar,” in which “watermelon sugar” is an element that results from the dehydration of watermelon. The novel was allegedly gifted to Harry Styles by ex-girlfriend Camille Rowe while they were dating, which reinforces the idea that the sugar left behind after dehydrating watermelons is akin to the love and passion abandoned at the end of their relationship.
Sugar is addictive. It’s sweet and energy-inducing, so it is no wonder that Styles yearns for that which he once savored (“Strawberries on a summer evenin' / Baby, you're the end of June / I want your belly and that summer feelin' / Getting washed away in you”). The musical breakdown during the bridge provides a clarity that highlights the yearning in Styles’ voice, but an ascending trumpet line escalates him back into that “watermelon sugar high.”
Given the track’s dynamic and brass-infused spirit, the timing of its release is odd; it seems more suited for the summer. That being said, its post-summer debut gives Styles’ words more significance given that he confesses his cravings for a past relationship.

Taylor Swift’s “Beautiful Ghosts” drips with theatricality and melancholia. Her latest single lacks the saccharine bubblegum-pop bounce of “Lover,” her newest album, which Swift released Aug. 23. This is perhaps for the better — songs like “ME!” and “You Need to Calm Down” are canned, artificial, and sweet enough to inspire a toothache. They are what comes to mind when one thinks of factory-produced music: airy, bubbly, and entirely devoid of substance.
“Beautiful Ghosts” has some substance, at least. The song comes from the motion picture soundtrack of the live-action adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s “Cats,” which hit theaters on Dec. 20. The song represents a pivotal moment for Victoria (Francesca Hayward), a character in the musical, when she expresses at once a longing for her naïve past and an apprehensive excitement for a liberated future.
The song is built upon this dichotomy: what came before, and what is to come after. In that way, it parallels “Memory,” arguably one of the most famous songs from the original “Cats” soundtrack, when the Grizabella character warbles about her lost past while thinking ahead toward what is to come.
“Beautiful Ghosts” lacks the catchiness of “Memory,” to be sure, perhaps because the song itself does not truly begin to pick up until a minute and a half in. It is also more professedly, outwardly tragic; whereas “Memory” skirts emotion, “Beautiful Ghosts” states it outright, almost blandly. Lyrics include “So I watch from the dark, wait for my life to start / With no beauty in my memory."
The song deals with Victoria’s lack of love in her past, abandoned to wander the streets on her own. The chorus, in the same vein as the lyrics above, begins with, “All that I wanted was to be wanted.” It is so soberly solemn that it verges on emo, reminiscent of some of Celine Dion’s lesser works. Hope for a wilder future does not enter the equation at all until the very end of the song, and, even then, it is marred by memories of “beautiful ghosts.” The opposition of a lonely past and a brighter future does not provide the complexity required for proclamations of such abject misery. The feeling behind the song comes off as shallow, lacking in both depth and range.
This all said, there are merits to be found in “Beautiful Ghosts.” Swift’s vocals are excellent — perhaps surprisingly so, given her latest work. She builds into the song nicely: While the emotion of the lyrics may be stilted, even awkward, Swift does an excellent job of adding passion and warmth where she can.
Perhaps the best part of the entire song is the bridge: “And so maybe my home isn’t what I had known / What I thought it would be / But I feel so alive with these phantoms of night / And I know that this life isn’t safe, but it’s wild and free.” Not only is this representative of an emotional catharsis in a strikingly poignant way, but it is also executed excellently by Swift, who encapsulates everything that a musical ballad should be. If the song begins weakly, almost whispered, it ends with a tour de force finish.
“Beautiful Ghosts” falls short in many ways, but it isn’t unpleasant to listen to. It’s the kind of song to be switched on after a particularly bad breakup or a fight with a best friend. Certainly, it has a superficial sadness to it, but it also ends on a piqued, bittersweet note — it’s a bildungsroman novel in a song, a coming-of-age realization that one is no longer the person that one used to be. There is a clear demarcation between what is, what was, and what will come to be.

Coldplay has the ability to just make life feel more … romantic. Blasting the band’s music on a walk makes the sun a little bit brighter and the grass that much greener. Their songs are emotionally stirring, grandiose, and otherworldly. But even when they turn to the somber side (consider “The Scientist”), they never lose the thread of hope that strings throughout their music. From the contemplative “Don’t Panic” to the hyped, electronic “Something Just Like This,” Coldplay’s discography focuses on the good life and all those who exist within it can bring.
With “Everyday Life,” Coldplay’s eighth studio album, the band expands upon this theme by focusing on pressing global issues. However, in typical Coldplay fashion, dark issues are not mulled upon and presented in the depressing trappings of a Billie Ellish or Juice Wrld track. “Everyday Life” not only highlights these issues but says its listeners should care about them because we all occupy this earth, and we are all affected by and can affect the changes that are happening.
The idea of a unified global population is showcased on “Arabesque,” one of the lead singles from the album. Musically, “Arabesque” — featuring Belgium artist Stromae — is one of the best on the album. Featuring a brass band, a snazzy saxophone solo, and an absolutely stirring climax, the composition makes up for somewhat simplistic lyrics. On “Arabesque,” Martin opens the song by singing, “I could be you, you could be me / Two raindrops in the same sea / You could be me, I could be you / Two angles of the same view” and he ends it by chanting[,] “Music is the weapon, music is the weapon of the future / Music is the weapon, music is the weapon of the future / Same fucking blood / Same fucking blood.” The lyrics are uncomplicated and won’t earn Coldplay many creativity points, but the message is laid bare and easily accessible. Perhaps that is the point.
Throughout the album Coldplay seems to be attempting to address as many pressing global issues as it can. In fact, the band even delayed touring this album out of concerns over climate change. On “Guns,” a folksy, acoustic-guitar heavy tune, Chris Martin sings about the miseducation of the poor, war profiteering, deforestation, and gun violence, among other things. “Who needs education or ‘A Thousand Splendid Suns’ / Poor is good for business, cut the forests, they're so dumb / Only save your look-alikes and fuck the other ones / It's the opinion of this board that we need more guns.” On “Trouble in Town,” the topics at hand are the discrimination Muslims face and the abuse of black Americans at the hands of the police. The middle of “Trouble in Town” features an audio recording of a verbal altercation between a young black man and the white Philadelphia police officer who presumably racially profiled and harassed him. On “Orphans,” Coldplay directly references the refugee crisis, specifically the 2018 bombings of Damascus, the capital of Syria.
These are heavy subjects (and ones that are worthy of discussion), but their importance loses its sting when paired with Coldplay’s light and upbeat musicality. “Orphans” is a bit of a banger. It gives the same carefree feeling of “KIDS” by MGMT. With lyrics such as “I want to know when I can go / Back and get drunk with my friends / I want to know when I can go / Back and be young again,” it feels like something teens at Coachella in their flower crowns and appropriated Native American clothing would jam to. The song feels relatable, but not because it’s about the refugee crisis. The strange juxtaposition between sound and substance starkly highlights how Coldplay’s feel-good vibes aren’t always the best for drawing attention to global crises.
Perhaps this is a product of the dark nature of contemporary popular music, but Coldplay’s unflinching optimism comes across as a bit corny in “Everyday Life.” Not that they haven’t been corny before (their 2016 Super Bowl performance was quite overwhelming), but it is not as endearing when one has to listen to more than 50 minutes of it. If “Everyday Life” moves and inspires its intended audience then, perhaps, all is well.

On Nov. 14, Taylor Swift made a post on her Tumblr account alleging that Scott Borchetta and Scooter Braun were prohibiting her from performing songs still owned by her former label Big Machine Records. Swift claimed that this would negatively impact both her ability to perform for the American Music Awards, in which she would be performing a hits medley in honor of receiving the Artist of the Decade Award, and the production process for her Netflix documentary series.
According to Swift, Borchetta and Braun did not want her to perform her music on television because they viewed it as re-recording her old music. Borchetta allegedly told Swift and her team that she could only use her music if she agreed to “not re-record copycat versions of her songs” and if she stopped “talking about [Borchetta] and Braun.”
In an interview with CBS in August of 2019, Swift said that she would re-record her first six albums due to her masters being sold to Scooter Braun, a record executive who has been at odds with Swift in the past. By owning the masters (which refers to the first recording of a song), Braun has complete control over the six Swift albums produced under her former label, Big Machine Records.
In Nov. 2018, after Taylor’s deal with Big Machine Records ended, she joined Universal Music Group with a deal that would enable her to own her masters going forward, However, her first six albums would still be controlled by Big Machine Label. On June 30, 2018 Swift announced in another Tumblr post that Scooter Braun had made a deal with Big Machine Label which included the purchasing of her masters. Although Swift stated that she had “made peace with the fact that eventually [Borchetta] would sell them,” she said that she was deeply upset that he had decided to sell them to Braun. She alleged that Borchetta knew of her feelings toward Braun and through the sale of her masters they were both complicit in “controlling a woman who didn’t want to be associated with them. In perpetuity.” Swift also alleged that Big Machine Records did not give her the chance to buy her own masters, but Big Machine Label posted a statement in an attempt to refute this claim.
By re-recording her own songs, Taylor would be able to circumvent the purchase of her masters and put her new recordings in direct competition of her old recordings.
Taylor Swift’s social media posts garnered an outpouring of sympathy and anger from her fans, some even going so far as to crowdfund #ISTANDWITHTAYLOR digital billboards. In response, Big Machine Records put out a statement saying that “at no point did we say Taylor could not perform on the AMAs or block her Netflix special.” However, Big Machine’s statement did not directly address Swift’s allegation that they were blocking her from using songs still owned by Big Machine Record.
On Nov. 18, four days after Swift’s public post, Big Machine Records put out a statement saying that they “agreed to grant all licenses of their artists' performances to stream post show and for re-broadcast on mutually approved platforms.” Recording artists such as Swift will not “need label approval for live performances on television or any other live media.” Swift was able to perform at the AMAs in honor of being crowned artist of the decade. She opened up her performance by wearing a white jacket with black lettering listing all of her records created under the Big Machine Label. After singing a few verses from her song Man of of her most recent album, Lover Swift sheds the the jacket and proceeds with her medley. It is certainly a statement especially because the outfit looks like a straightjacket, trapping her.
Love Swift or hate her, it is difficult not to empathize her in this situation. Artists put their heart and soul into their music only to become victims of the politics and greed of the recording industry. What is especially sinister is that if even Swift — multi-grammy winning, multi-platinum charting artist of the decade — still faces these issues, then imagine what might be happening to up and coming artists. It is hard to tell whether Swift’s battle with Big Machine Records is over, but we can savor the small victory for now.

Doja Cat has come a long way since her song “Mooo!” went viral last year. After gaining national attention from the cow-themed song, the rapper released a deluxe version of her debut album “Amala,” collaborated with fellow rapper Rico Nasty on the hit single “Tia Tamera,” and saw the remix of her song “Juicy,” featuring Tyga, reach the Billboard Hot 100 — her first song to do so. Despite facing controversy over resurfaced homophobic tweets from 2015, Doja Cat continues to ride out her success with the release of her second studio album “Hot Pink.” On “Hot Pink,” released Nov. 7, Doja Cat raps and sings about sexual desire and authority. Through her sexually explicit lyrics and dynamic rap verses, Doja Cat makes it known that, when it comes to relationships, she is in charge.
Those familiar with “Amala” know that Doja Cat is not one to shy away from singing about sex or what she wants. (See: “Amala’s” opener “Go To Town,” a song about cunninlingus.) While the songs on “Amala” do refer to Doja Cat’s sex life, the references are wrapped up in metaphors. On “Hot Pink,” the artist is more explicit about her experiences. The opening track, “Cyber Sex,” is a perfect example of how personal Doja Cat’s music has become. “Cyber Sex” is like a rated R version of Beyoncé’s “Video Phone,” with lyrics that reflect Doja Cat’s reluctance to let physical distance spoil her sex life (“When he off work, he calling me on Skype” and “Can’t give head, you give me the FaceTime”). The song is just the beginning of Doja Cat expressing her sexual freedom and demanding what she wants from her partners.
On what might be “Hot Pink’’’s most NSFW song, “Rules,” Doja Cat sets some parameters for her partners. With the first lyrics of the song, “Said play with my pussy / But don’t play with my emotions,” the rapper immediately takes charge of both her lover and her listeners. The second verse of the track is the best verse on the album. Over a smooth bass line, minimal guitar, and steady drum beat, Doja Cat raps about wanting a partner who is devoted (not deceitful), has money, and knows how to please her. The artist’s flow is completely original as she switches from fast, steady wordplay about pleasure to a breathy taunt to or to rhythmic shouting for a lover who does not play mind games. Doja Cat’s lack of modesty coupled with her unique rap game makes “Rules” a standout song.
The first half of “Hot Pink” is strong and self-assured, but the second half tapers off. Songs like “Cyber Sex,” “Rules,” “Bottom Bitch,” and “Won’t Bite” (featuring Smino) — a song that has barking sounds in the background — are uniquely Doja Cat. The artist showcases her songwriting and performing abilities best on these songs. “Say So” and “Addiction” are fun and upbeat, but the rapping on both tracks is not up to par with the verses on “Rules.” In comparison to “Won’t Bite,” “Like That (featuring Gucci Mane)” is flat-out boring — not even Gucci Mane could save it, offering instead an uncharacteristically unspectacular verse. While Doja Cat’s singing on “Streets” is enticing, with lyrics such as “I found it hard to find someone like you / Like you, like you / Send your location, come through,” the song is not particularly unique (recall “Location” by Khalid).
Doja Cat’s sexual freedom, ability to switch flow in the middle of a verse, and fun wordplay are all commendable elements of “Hot Pink.” Unfortunately, the latter half of the album do not reach the expectations set by the former. While none of the songs on “Hot Pink” are so unenjoyable that they need to be skipped, the less unique tracks do not warrant the same attention that the standouts do. “Cyber Sex,” “Rules,” “Won’t Bite,” and “Bottom Bitch” all exemplify the wasted potential of the rest of the album. Still, in spite of its pitfalls, “Hot Pink” in it entirety is still worth a listen or two, if just to hear a woman proudly in control of her sexuality and her sound.

Billie Eilish has never been one to release bubblegum pop — a trend that holds true on her new single “everything i wanted.” Written by Eilish and her collaborator (and older brother) Finneas O’Connell, “everything i wanted” gives listeners a look into Eilish’s unsettling nightmares and the siblings’ protective relationship. Although a deeply personal song, in comparison to Eilish’s other work, “everything i wanted” does not stand out.
Even for Eilish, who is known for lyrics such as “The way I wear my noose / Like a necklace” and “Take me to the rooftop / I wanna see the world when I stop breathing,” “everything i wanted” is dark. Over four simple piano chords, drum beats that sound like GarageBand samples, and a repetitive ringing sound, Eilish sings about her fears and nightmares. The song begins with the lyrics “I had a dream / I got everything I wanted / Not what you’d think / And if I’m bein’ honest / It might’ve been a nightmare.” The coupling of disenchanting lyrics and monotonous instruments makes the track lifeless from the start. The proceeding lines “Thought I could fly / So I stepped off the Golden / Nobody cried / Nobody even noticed,” coming from a 17-year-old, are more disconcerting than deft.
While more upbeat and hopeful than the verses, the pre-chorus and chorus of “everything i wanted” are too generic to save the song. The same four piano chords continue with more stale drum beats as Eilish sings about her loving relationship with her brother. The chorus “And you say, ‘As long as I’m here, no one can hurt you’” portrays the siblings’ desire to protect one another. Although these lyrics are loving and a lot happier than the first verse, they are not exemplary of Eilish and O’Connell’s particular songwriting capabilities
On older songs such as “idontwannabeyouanymore” and “xanny,” Eilish showcases her ability to be both vulnerable and stylistically unique in her music. These tracks exemplify Eilish’s vocal range, ability to make sad songs upbeat, and original use of synths and modifiers to alter her voice. Although the song is personal and features the kind of melancholic lyrics that are emblematic of Eilish’s style, “everything i wanted,” unlike her other work, is boring. It is possible that Eilish wanted to take a break from the theatrics typical to her music. After releasing one EP and one studio album and going on two headline tours in just two years, it is also possible that Eilish is burnt out. “everything i wanted” is an unfortunate fluke in Eilish’s canon, one that will hopefully not be repeated in the artist’s still bright future.

For about half of American poetry’s history, it was actually quite British. That is because British poetry served as the model for many colonist writers around the start of American poetry in the 17th century. It was during the 19th century that we saw the rise of a uniquely American poetry — one that grew more and more distinct as we entered the 20th century. The year of 1912 was an especially important point in the trajectory of American modern poetry, due to the inception of a few key poetry practices and institutions.
Harriet Monroe’s “Poetry: A Magazine of Verse”
In 1911, at age 51, a female poet roamed downtown Chicago in search of support for a publication solely for poetry. This was bold and unprecedented. Never before had the U.S. had such a journal. The context didn’t make it much easier; there was little good poetry and even less demand, and not much hope of Chicago diverting artistic attention away from the well-recognized prestigious forums of the Art Institute and the Chicago Symphony. At the same time, the woman — Harriet Monroe — saw the presence of such forums, in addition to a world-class symphony and opera, theater troupes, dance companies, and so on, as a source of potential in Chicago’s early 20th century cultural landscape. Thus, she set out to elevate poetry in Chicago’s cultural consciousness in the same manner as other arts had. After much work and planning, including performances of her poem “The Columbian Ode” at the opening ceremonies of Dedication Day at the Chicago World’s Fair and constant networking with Chicago’s social elites, Monroe was eventually able to secure the financial backing for the endeavor, and the first issue of “Poetry: A Magazine of Verse” appeared in October of 1912.
The Magazine’s Open Door Policy
This first issue of “Poetry: A Magazine of Verse” from 1912 included Monroe’s “Open Door Policy,” which Monroe put forth this way: “The Open Door will be the policy of this magazine—may the great poet we are looking for never find it shut, or half-shut, against his ample genius!” In this way, the magazine supported and perpetuated poetry with diversity in style, genre, approach, etc. The magazine established its reputation early on by publishing the first important poems of Hilda Dolittle (commonly H.D.), T.S. Eliot, Marianne Moore, Ezra Pound, Carl Sandburg, Wallace Stevens, William Carlos Williams and more now-famed poets, and it quickly became the world’s leading English-language poetry journal. The magazine, now under the less redundant title of “Poetry,” is credited with playing a pivotal role in the “Renaissance in American Poetry” as the oldest monthly devoted to verse in the English-speaking world.
Imagism
Although the concept of imagism originated as early as 1908, when T.E. Hulme spoke of an exacting poetry with no excess verbiage, imagism as a movement really began in 1912 with the famous modernist poet Ezra Pound’s efforts. In 1912, after reading H.D.’s “Hermes of the Ways,” Pound signed the poem “H.D., Imagiste” before sending it to Monroe’s Poetry magazine in October of that year, and he himself used the term “Imagiste” when publishing Hulme’s Complete Poetical Works. Imagism — a style of poetry favoring simplicity, clarity of expression, and extreme concision through concrete visual images, as a response to the romanticism of its Victorian predecessors — has been described as the most influential movement in English poetry.

With the resurgence of American populism, the escalation of intra-party conflict, and the specter of impeachment looming over Washington, the future of U.S. politics is increasingly uncertain. This is especially true for the Democratic Party, whose voters are faced with a historically crowded pool of candidates for the 2020 presidential nomination. With competing voices spanning the political spectrum and the party’s identity at stake, the choice can seem a bit overwhelming. As a result, many on the left have looked to TV pundits — like Jon Stewart, Rachel Maddow, and Bill Maher — for clarity by way of political and cultural commentary.
Others, however, have looked to Squidward Tentacles. The grouchy octopus and longtime Bikini Bottom resident has become an unlikely voice for young people disillusioned with the social and economic status quo. Squidward’s role in political discourse has been noted by many; Rodger Bumpass, the character’s voice actor, called him a “poster child” for disaffected millennials, and his relatability is the subject of countless blog posts and Reddit threads. With his suction cup on the pulse of the nation, might Squidward have any wisdom to offer voters about the 2020 Democratic presidential field?
We think so. In celebration of his recently announced Netflix spinoff series, here are several top Democratic presidential candidates represented by Squidward quotations.
Joe Biden: “Just listen to me! I’m not supposed to be here. I gotta get home to my own time period! I gotta go!” (“SB-129,” Season 1)
Whether he’s reminiscing about President Kennedy’s moon shot speech or encouraging parents to leave the “record player” on at night for their kids, former vice president Biden has struck many as a visitor from a bygone era. Like Squidward after his 2,000-year imprisonment in the Krusty Krab freezer, Biden clearly has some acclimating left to do.
Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren: “The gentle laborer shall no longer suffer from the noxious greed of Mr. Krabs! We will dismantle oppression board by board! We’ll saw the foundation of big business in half, even if it takes an eternity! With your support, we will send the hammer of the people’s will crashing through the windows of Mr. Krabs’ house of servitude!” (“Squid on Strike,” Season 2)
Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are fierce critics of the American capitalist elite, and both have made the issue of skyrocketing income inequality central to their campaigns. Several commentators have raised doubts about the feasibility of their progressive proposals, which include Medicare For All plans and taxes on wealth. However, these skeptics would do well to remember the success of Comrade Tentacles’ similarly ambitious “Krusty Krab Unfair” campaign, which saw the end of Mr. Krabs’ greedy labor practices and the (literal) dismantling of his establishment.
Pete Buttigieg: “The first place snail racing cup presented to Squidward...Tortellini?” [sigh] “Will I ever win?” (“The Great Snail Race,” Season 3)
Mayor Pete’s last name has confounded voters of every color, creed, and political persuasion (Jimmy Kimmel even did a segment on it). While Mr. Buttigieg has been a good sport about the confusion, the same cannot be said of Squidward, whose last name Tentpoles — er, Tentacles — was flubbed repeatedly leading up to the Bikini Bottom snail race.
Michael Bloomberg: “I always thought the most important rule was, ‘Why do today what you can put off ‘till tomorrow’!” (“Imitation Krabs,” Season 2).
Bloomberg’s late entrance into the presidential race has raised more than a few eyebrows, and the unusual timing of his announcement has even given rise to several conspiracy theories. But perhaps he just shares Squidward’s penchant for procrastination. When your campaign is backed a $58 billion fortune, it probably doesn’t matter much anyway.

With a chart-topping album and an appearance at Coachella, 17-year-old Billie Eilish is emerging as the child star of our generation. And she’s doing it her own way, with whispery vocals, hyper-processed sounds, and a not-quite-goth aesthetic of neon hair dye and dark, baggy clothing. But Billie Eilish is one thing few would expect of someone with her early success and edgy style: a substance-free teen.
On “Xanny,” a track from her debut album “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?” Eilish explains why she abstains from alcohol, weed, and Xanax (the titular drug). Of drug users, she says she’s “Better off without them / They're nothing but unstable / Bring ashtrays to the table / And that's about the only thing they share.” As the dramatic yet minimal ballad floats on, Eilish’s friends get stoned, but she stays sober, “in their secondhand smoke / Still just drinking canned coke.”
On Dec. 5, Eilish debuted a music video for “Xanny.” It’s her ninth music video, and the first she directed herself. In the video, Eilish looks strangely “normal”: She wears an understated cream sweater and her hair is a natural brown. Sitting cross-legged on a white bench in a white tiled room, she looks much like an average person on the street and little like her typical stage persona. The video progresses in a series of small, shocking movements. The camera zooms in and out on Eilish’s face; she dances robotically, following the music mostly with her neck, head, and glazed eyes; and at the song’s climactic moments, disembodied hands enter the frame and extinguish cigarettes on her face.
Eilish isn’t one for minimalism. That’s why her decision to bring natural hair, an understated outfit, and an almost all-white palette to her first self-directed music video is so interesting. In many ways, Eilish seems to be inhabiting the character of the addict she describes in the “Xanny” video: Her eyes are glazed over and she’s apathetic, barely reacting as cigarette burns cover her face. This choice overturns many pop music narratives around drugs and alcohol. For Eilish, getting drunk and high isn’t sexy; it’s dull and repetitive, colorless and numbing. Her cool self is her sober self.
There’s an obvious explanation for Eilish’s attitude: She’s still too young to legally drink or promote drug use without raising eyebrows. But age has been no obstacle to other hard-partying child stars, and Eilish’s conviction seems legitimate, coming out not only in her recordings but also in her interviews. So maybe Eilish’s substance-free attitude reflects something more meaningful. Eilish has long complicated the norms of female celebrity, refusing to be sexualized to sell records. Paradoxically, in being boring, this music video may represent an attempt by Eilish to twist pop culture’s norms around drug use—another attempt to do fame differently.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The end of 2019 means more than just the beginning of a new decade – it means the Roaring Twenties are back in full swing. When we think of the popular culture of this time period, we might imagine the flourishing art scene of the Harlem Renaissance and jazz music or the birth of feature films and dance clubs. While we can’t necessarily reinvent these cultural shifts today, we can pretend we’re living the high life of the Twenties by dressing the part, and take some fashion inspiration and Charleston into the New Year.
1. Flapper Dress
What’s the Twenties without a dress to shimmy in? Flappers were young women of the 1920s who rebelled against stereotypes of feminine behavior in favor of activities like drinking, driving cars, and dismissing sexual norms. French designer Coco Chanel greatly influenced the classic dress we know today with her fresh, boyish styles. Original flapper dresses are known for their sleeveless, knee-length silhouette with a straight, drop waist that deemphasized the female figure. These dresses tended to flatten the bust and performed a functional role to the wearer with its loose design, allowing for a greater range of motion.
2. Cloche Hat
Keep your noggin warm this winter with a chic cloche hat! These bell-shaped hats (“cloche” is French for bell) paired well with the cropped haircuts women flaunted during the 1920s. Because these hats tend to sit low on the forehead, they have an extra warmth-factor to them. While often made of felt, the materials varied — sometimes, people wore straw cloches in the summer or beaded ones for a night of dancing. Cloches also became a medium for artistic expression as the Art Deco movement took off. Some hats had jeweled brooches, feathers, embroidery, or ribbons. These ribbons could even be fashioned into different bows or knots that indicated the relationship status of the wearer.
3. Red Lipstick
The 1920s also ushered in industrial advances, some of which revolutionized the makeup industry. The 1915 invention of the metal lipstick container revolutionized the application of lip products. New, longer-lasting stains and glosses became available, likely popularized by film actresses. Makeup users especially enjoyed accentuating the cupid’s bow of the lips with extra crisp lines. Katy Perry can thank the twenties for her positive experience in “I Kissed A Girl” – cherry-flavored lipstick was also invented during this time period.
4. Oxford Bags
After Oxford University’s administration banned knickerbockers (baggy pants that gathered at the knee), young British men skirted around the rule by wearing trousers that fit over them comfortably. These extra loose, wide-legged pants are known as Oxford bags. Oxford bags became a trendy fashion item for men, especially those in Ivy League universities, who learned of the style through studying abroad. College-aged men in America popularized the style enough for United States president Calvin Coolidge to take notice of them, although he said he “wouldn’t be caught dead” wearing them! These pants fit normally around the waist, but their cuffs could have a circumference as wide as 44 inches.
As we tango into 2020, take time to reflect upon the fashion from a hundred years ago and perhaps reinvent your style for your New Year’s resolution. Jay Gatsby is surely rolling in his grave, yearning to throw the most epic New Year’s party to commemorate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The American Repertory Theater’s world premiere production of “Moby Dick” has everything you could want in a new musical. Beautifully crafted and innovative set design, haunting music, a stellar cast, perfectly synchronized choreography, winning voices. All the elements are just right. It is a great tragedy, then, that the musical’s most successful elements are left unmoored due to the script’s mixed up themes. In efforts to bring modernity to this colossal 19th-century work, the musical loses sight of many of Herman Melville’s original themes while also tending to get lost in its own colossal production.
For the most part, the A.R.T.’s musical is a retelling of the original work. When the show begins, the narrator Ishmael, played by a compelling and earnest Manik Choksi, addresses the audience to tell them that he is an immigrant who has suffered great despair in America. In order to cope with this, he finds himself turning to Melville’s masterpiece. Ishmael begins to frame this adaptation by providing Melville’s biographical information, focusing on his very close relationship with fellow author Nathaniel Hawthorne. As Ishmael then envisions himself aboard the Pequod, the cast of characters introduce themselves through a set of jazzy, lively songs and robust choreography.
Those familiar with the book and the common queer reading of Ishmael and the harpooner Queequeg (Andrew Cristi)’s relationship will not be surprised to see a link between the introductory biographical facts and the book’s very own plot. In fact, much of the musical is influenced by their tender relationship. This is a successful choice as the play’s best musical numbers largely comes from Choksi and Crist’s chemistry and energy. Numbers like “A Bosom Friend” represent the musical’s capacity to translate the book to the stage well, producing moving and funny songs that energetically bring beloved characters to life.
Yet from the start, things are muddied as the show toes a fine line between lauding Melville’s work and criticizing it. These simultaneous goals conflict with each other so frequently that they culminate in more confusion than reconciliation.
In its attempts to atone for the original book’s mistakes, the play goes too far or else is too obvious in its efforts. It casts actors of all genders and races into the roles of white New Englanders and indigenous crew members, a choice that works well much to the credit of the cast. In particular, the performances of the fabulous and mesmerizing actresses that play mates Flask (Anna Ishida), Stubb (Kalyn West), and Starbuck (Starr Busby) illustrate that this casting is ultimately a necessary choice. The issue, however, lies in how pointedly the other characters address these ironies to the audience. Where it might have allowed the paradox to speak for itself, “Moby Dick” has the tendency to be distractingly self-reflective.
While the first couple of nudges and winks from the characters might be amusing, the constant reminders become rather too pointed. Mid-way through the play, Eric Berryman, the actor playing the mystic character Fedallah openly acknowledges this character’s Orientalism-inspired portrayal in the book and Melville’s often problematic descriptions of his characters’ identities. As he does so he removes his costume and breaks out of character, announcing himself to be the black actor that he really is. Berryman performs an initially admirable stand-up bit that relies on tongue-and-cheek jokes about the blind casting and his own paycheck.
Many of the jokes land just right largely due to Berryman’s charismatic delivery, but the longer the bit goes, the more he sinks into opaque, disparaging comments about the world. Overall, this style of humor reflects the play’s tendency to make sweeping critical remarks without citing any specific issues. Criticisms about racism and climate change are clearly articulated, but the nihilistic statements about the cruelty of humanity take no clear form and merely prolong the sentiment of being unanchored.
The musical’s numbers themselves are poppy, experimental, catchy, and stalwart, made all the better by a stellar band with fantastic saxophonists and trombone players that steal the attention of any song they perform. These musicians all mirror Melville’s own experimental form chapters beautifully. At times, the song’s lyrics themselves feel somewhat detached from the music, especially those which rely on direct lines from the book. At times, even the music mirrors the confusion of the show’s themes. All the actors and singers are mesmerizing, particularly Dawn L. Troupe as Captain Gardiner of the Rachel who performs a heartbreaking number about the desolate captain pleading for Ahab (Tom Nelis)’s help in saving his crew. Nelis also delivers an astonishing performance, perfectly straddling the embodiment of this madman while also imbuing him with pity, particularly when he delivers the famous self-reflexive “Is Ahab, Ahab?” speech.
The show’s set is absolutely brilliant and breathtaking. Costume designer Brenda Abbandandolo produced period costumes that somehow manage to appear modern, lending the work a sense of timelessness. Scenic designer Mimi Lien used wooden masts and a poop deck to create the aura of the ship, but also surrounded the entire stage with wooden canopy to resemble both the belly of the ship and the rib cage of a whale. These clever elements have the effect of welcoming the audience both onto and into the ship, making them as much a part of the production as the crew.
And yet, when the cast actually welcomes members of the audience onto the stage to participate as crew members, even whirling them around in small whaling boats, the effect is too much. The participation devolves into heavy gimmick that becomes quite ridiculous to those not directly participating. Audience participation in the beloved whale sperm squeezing scene successfully provides a reprieve from the heaviness of the work and a display of male friendship. But for the most part, these scenes only elongate what is already a very long show.
Writer, composer, and lyricist Dave Malloy and director Rachel Chavkin were bound to ruffle feathers in adapting what many hail as the first great American novel. But with “Moby Dick,” they do too good a job unravelling and rewriting the story. Sure, the product is provocative and original — at once recognizable and changed — but it doesn’t do much in the way of providing solutions to the issues it raises. Many of the show’s criticisms about Melville’s portrayal of indigenous people, his lengthy chapters, or his blatant misinformation about whales appear valid. However, if the premise attempts to convince us that the story of “Moby Dick” is the antidote America needs in 2020, then the play goes out of its way to shut down that thesis. It begs the most telling question of all: If the creators are so critical of most of Melville’s choices, then why adapt“Moby Dick” in the first place?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than half of Harvard Law School students who responded to a 2017 mental health survey reported experiencing mild to severe depression and anxiety, according to a report released Friday by a Law School working group of faculty, staff, and students.
The report references aspects of a 2017 student mental health survey at the Law School, whose results student activists have long called on administrators to publish. The working group’s report is accessible to affiliates of the school online.
HLS assembled the working group in fall 2018, tapping Marcia L. Sells, the Law School’s dean of students, and Jessica L. Soban ’02, the school’s associate dean for strategic initiatives, to lead it.
“The Working Group met multiple times over the past year, examining data, consulting with members of the Law School and University communities, speaking with experts, and thinking creatively about how to promote student well-being,” Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 wrote in an email to students Friday.
The group reported that 35 percent of Law School respondents to the survey screened positive for mild depression, 15.6 percent for moderate depression, 5.8 percent for moderately severe depression, and 3.6 percent for severe depression. The survey also found 15.1 percent of Law School respondents screened positive for moderate anxiety and 9.1 percent screened positive for severe anxiety.
Administered anonymously, the Law School conducted the survey in coordination with the school’s student government and then-Executive Director of Harvard University Health Services Paul J. Barreira between November 16, 2017 and January 19, 2018.
Roughly 44 percent of law school students across cohorts responded to the survey. Participation rates varied by class year and program: 44.1 percent of first-year Law School students took the survey, compared to 49.3 percent of second-year students, 42.2 percent of third-year students, and 33.9 percent of Doctor of Juridical Science students.
Manning wrote in his email to students that the report provides a sense of where the Law School stands in the broader context of the legal profession, legal education, and graduate education.
“Through a series of thoughtful recommendations, the Working Group also lays out an initial framework for addressing the mental health and well-being challenges on our campus,” Manning wrote. “They further identify some things we can do right away to improve student well-being.”
The survey also asked three questions related to suicide, including a question asking whether respondents had considered committing suicide at any time during their life.
Barreira — who currently directs graduate student mental health initiatives — wrote in a letter to the working group that he now believes the data from those questions is flawed and does not accurately measure current risk. The report does not include any of the data from the suicide-related questions.
“In the initial administration of the mental health graduate student survey in 2016 and 2017, I used the Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised to assess level of suicidality,” Barreira wrote. “After the administration of two surveys, however, I realized that I was unintentionally measuring primarily life-time risk of suicidality, rather than current risk.”
Addressing sleep, exercise, and alcohol use, the working group’s report found that respondents were not practicing “adequate” self-care.
Just over 40 percent of respondents reported that “they do not feel rested when they wake up for the majority of days in a week,” and 80.9 percent reported that they do not meet the American Heart Association guidelines for exercise. 37.5 percent screened positive for problematic drinking.
The report stated that environmental factors — including the “imposter phenomenon,” social support and loneliness, and feeling overwhelmed — may factor into the survey’s results and could provide potential “areas for intervention.” It also noted that only 55.1 percent of respondents were aware of available campus mental health resources, while 19.5 percent reported concerns that seeking mental health help might impact their bar eligibility.
The working group also compiled a list of recommendations to “support well-being and mental health at both HLS and the University.” The recommendations included expanding avenues to workshops and clinical care, fostering a cohesive Harvard Law School community to support students' well-being, advocating to eliminate mental health questions from bar applications, and more effectively communicating available resources and services.
“Although we can never eliminate stress or worry entirely, we can aspire to reduce the stigma associated with mental health challenges, to help students better care for themselves and their peers, and to provide the robust continuum of wellness and mental health resources that students need to thrive at HLS,” the report reads.
Since 2016, Harvard University Health Services has conducted multiple graduate and professional school mental health surveys. The Law School’s report references data collected in those surveys to contextualize its own statistics.
In a November interview, Barierra said mental health surveys of College freshmen and five departments across the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences showed significant signs of depression and anxiety. Prevalence rates of depression across the surveyed graduate departments ranged from 15 percent to 30 percent, while prevalence rates of anxiety ranged from a 13.2 percent to 30 percent. The surveys had an average response rate of 63.5 percent.
“There's a small percentage of students across the University, just graduate students, who we would want every one of them to be in treatment or at least getting an evaluation,” Barreira said in November.
Since 2018, the Law School has created programming that promotes self-care, including new clinical drop-in hours at Pound Hall, expanded grief support groups, and more mental health training for student advisors, according to the report.
In 2019, HUHS piloted same day appointments at Counseling and Mental Health Services, which are single 30-minute counseling sessions to discuss non-urgent issues. The appointments are for students not already seeing a clinician. CAMHS and the Undergraduate Council also launched an anonymous and confidential online screening tool for depression, eating disorders, alcohol use, anxiety, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder earlier this year.
The working group concluded that the Law School can do more to support students.
“Despite the efforts undertaken by HLS in the relatively short period since the 2017-2018 survey, it is clear that more can and should be done to support student well-being and mental health at both HLS and the University,” the report reads. “Both have taken up the challenge in parallel.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge Police Department billed Harvard around $185,000 in security fees associated with the first two weeks of the graduate student union’s strike, according to CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick.
CPD sent the University an invoice to pay for “safety and security support” associated with the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers strike earlier this month, Warnick wrote in an email. The bill covers strike-related costs the police department incurred between Dec. 3 and Dec. 16.
HGSU-UAW began striking on Dec. 3 after 13 months of contract negotiations with University administrators. Striking union members and their supporters have picketed around campus, disrupted package deliveries, and held rallies featuring prominent politicians in Harvard Yard.
Warnick wrote that CPD intended to keep both passers-by and picketers safe. He added that Harvard requested the additional security.
“Our goal with this type of event is to provide a police presence in order to insure the safety of those participating and to maintain the normal flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic,” he wrote. “In the event of a disturbance or hazardous traffic event, officers would be responsible for assignments such as crowd control, road closures, traffic detour contingencies, enforcement (if necessary), etc.”
Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano declined to comment on whether his department has also increased its presence due to the strike, citing the department’s policy “not to comment on staffing, equipment, operations, and security measures” in an email.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain also declined to comment, citing the same HUPD policy.
In recent years, Harvard has requested support from CPD for other high-profile events.
CPD charged the University $12,000 in security fees when controversial sociologist Charles A. Murray ’65 spoke at the Harvard Kennedy School in 2017.
Some HGSU-UAW members took issue with the high dollar amounts the University has paid CPD. In online posts, several graduate students wrote that the University is willing to pay for crowd control but not for the union’s proposed higher wages.
In a Tweet sent earlier this month, striking union member and History of Science Ph.D. student Bradley G. Bolman compared the amount Harvard is paying CPD to monitor the picket line to the amount that Harvard has proposed to put in a pool fund to help student workers pay for child care.
Since the time of Bolman’s post, Harvard has increased its proposed dollar amount for this pool fund from $275,000 to $325,000 annually.
Bolman wrote that he views Harvard’s payment to CPD as evidence that the University is financially equipped to meet the union’s demands.
“[I]t's clear that the university *could* afford to offer graduate students far more than currently proposed, yet would rather toss this away externally than improve student life,” Bolman wrote.
Swain declined to comment on Bolman’s criticisms.
Josh D. Bronson — who directs training for the campus safety agency International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators — said in an interview that it is standard procedure for universities to employ local law enforcement to provide security for special events on campus.
“This is not an uncommon practice for campuses to contract with local police departments to provide extra security for certain, you know, activities and that could be anything from athletic events, to graduations to, you know, other large events,” Bronson said.
Bronson, who is a former assistant director of campus safety at McDaniel College in Westminster, Md., said that costs associated with extra security tend to run high.
“Universities usually pay overtime costs because they're bringing in extra officers for the local police department,” he said. “So that could account for the high price tag.”
He added that Harvard could be paying CPD to “keep the protesters safe.”
“It's not always about just, you know, making sure that the protesters are, are behaving, you know, and following the law, it's very often more about making sure that their first amendment rights are being upheld and that they're not going to be facing any sort of backlash from anybody,” he said.
