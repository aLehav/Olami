After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
How far can the ramifications from one violent event reach? How many degrees of separate truly partition complete strangers? In her vibrant new novel “How It All Began,” Penelope Lively attempts to explore these questions through a “human version” of a highway pileup. The result is hardly as outwardly gory as a collision, but it is equally interconnected and upsetting.
The intersection of countless lives begins on the streets of London, where a delinquent opportunist mugs Charlotte Rainsford, a retired schoolteacher, and breaks her hip in the process. From there, Lively careens from one unfortunate situation to another and invites the reader to look on as nine different lives twist and turn in increasingly difficult situations. Lively believably constructs these stories by fully investing in the development of every character; despite the wide array of perspectives, she effectively highlights the individual personalities and struggles of the majority of people in the story. Yet at the same time, her writing inherently leads the reader to sympathize more with certain people than others—Charlotte, for example, is far more sympathetic than Henry, the arrogant historian. The reader thus gradually finds himself immersed in Charlotte’s struggle and subconsciously roots for her to succeed. It is here, in personal explorations, that the chaos of various experiences recedes and the characters themselves take center stage.
Lively chooses to open the novel with a quote from James Gleick’s “Chaos.” “The Butterfly Effect was the reason,” Gleik wrote. “Errors and uncertainties multiply, cascading upward through a chain of turbulent features.” This quote is apt, for the sequence of events in the novel jumps unpredictably after the inital experience of Charlotte’s assault. Before long, the purse thief has indirectly caused a divorce, a romance, and a national scandal. The chaotic interactions between characters continue to escalate throughout the novel with no end to the chain reaction in sight. These unpredictable fallout effects serve as powerful reminders of the potentially vast repercussions of any event. Lively utilizes this provocative theme to make her characters question the results of their independent actions.
One surprising aspect of the novel is that the female characters are far more sympathetic than their male counterparts. Their initial appearances would not suggest their hidden strife, and Lively soon reveals that there is more to these placid women than a calm exterior. These aspects of the women contrast heavily with the one-dimensional male characters, who are haplessly disengaged from their role in the world’s complexity.
As the story progresses, intense interest in the characters’ struggles begins to recede. When the damage mounts, Lively’s sympathetic yet devastating character portrayals actually leave the reader yearning for all the fictional lives to return to normal. The travails of old age come to light especially through Charlotte and Henry: Charlotte grows more frail by the day due to her hip injury, and Henry—in one of his only sympathetic moments—must deal with memory loss as he tries to continue his illustrious academic career. Both worry about being left behind by a younger generation and approaching the end of their lives. As compelling as it is to skip from one disaster to another, the characters’ difficult situations make it increasingly hard to find entertainment in the mess of their lives. This choice between desire for chaos and engagement with the characters is disorienting. Lively thus effectively and intelligently turns the entire premise of the novel on its head. No longer is this a compilation of snapshots of various sad lives but a cathartic and upsetting character study in individual experiences. Her unrelenting prose continues to lead the reader across these short, separate, and devastating narratives.
“And what of the mugger?” Lively invites the reader to question at the novel’s end. “The catalyst, he or she who set everything off?”  For the mugger—after Charlotte’s initial fateful encounter—slips away, never to appear again. Like a scientist observing her own experiment, Lively walks the reader through a laboratory of lives yet barely gives enough attention to each unfolding situation. She posits unanswered questions and, by the novel’s unresolved end, appears to marvel at her own carefully constructed chaos.
Though Lively may be able to move forward to the next scenario, her precise and effective emotional construction leaves the reader behind. She creates these characters to entrance and fascinate, but the abrupt departures from situations presume the reader can leave the characters behind as callously as the narrative does. This is frightening—but also, on an emotional level, a uniquely thought-provoking experience. We have seen their discord, and we reflect upon it. Lively has written a book whose ideas haunt long beyond the last page. That itself is notable achievement. Through upsetting snapshots of characters’ lives, Lively invites the reader to peer in. Her language and ability to manufacture a connection create a singularly compelling novel.

“Myths and creeds are heroic struggles to comprehend the truth in the world,” Ansel Adams once said. People choose to rely—at face value—on the timeless messages contained in these stories, rather than attempt to unravel their original composition. Perhaps this is for the best, for the beauty of a myth often relies on its uncomplicated explanation of extraordinary events. Argentinian writer César Aira, on the other hand, begs to differ. “Varamo,” translated by Chris Andrews, is a testimony to the fact that the backstory behind a seemingly fantastical myth is always worth exploring. Over the course of the novella, Aira narrates the story of the inspiration behind an ordinary man’s impressive literary debut.
Aira writes “Varamo” in a scientific and analytical style, but its content is decidedly surreal—a somewhat unsurprising choice, given the impressive creative history of magical realism exemplified by other Latin American writers. At the novel’s outset, these surreal elements are less apparent. In the city of Colón, Argentina, the government accidentally pays Varamo, a lower-class employee, his wage in counterfeit bills. Even more peculiar, he is planning to write a book about his favorite hobby called “How to Embalm Small Mutant Animals.” Yet these aspects of the novel are quite commonplace compared to his experience when his Chinese mother pays a visit and starts ranting to her son in Cantonese—a language he does not even understand—about a malicious poison-pen letter she received. Varamo then proceeds to unveil an assassination attempt on the Panamanian interior minister—and still, the bombastic absurdity of events has barely commenced its crescendo. By the end of this remarkably curious day, he will write “The Song of the Virgin Child,” a fictional piece of acclaimed modern poetry. Varamo’s day appears quite absurd to the reader but may actually be commonplace in his environment, a city where even “regularity races:” In the book’s setting, the aim of most citizens is merely to keep pace in a frenetically changing society and not get lost amidst the hustle and bustle of a thriving metropolis.
Upon entering the compelling world of “Varamo,” there is no way out. Aira establishes a strong grip on the reader in the first few sentences, which describe the nature of the novel: “It was a bubble in time, in his biography, an unprecedented and unrepeated exception. The action contained the inspiration, and vice versa, each nourishing and consuming the other, so that nothing was left over.” The narrative style is usually straightforward and simple—just like Varamo himself—yet Aira’s motives over the following 85 pages are more ambitious than the humble background of his protagonist. Aira vows to debunk the myth surrounding Varamo’s literary creation and rise to fame by dissecting in meticulous detail this one fateful day.
When the methodical and impersonal tone of “Varamo” is coupled with these extraordinary phenomena, hilarity ensues in an uncanny way. Aira’s humorous writing style is absurd yet always ironic, simple in logic yet increasingly mystifying in message. Aira describes Varamo’s realization of the impossibility of embalming a fish playing a miniature piano with the following description: “Some association of ideas prompted him to notice a detail that rather seriously undermined his project: fish don’t have arms, so they don’t have hands, or fingers, and can’t possibly play the piano, even as a joke.” In his naiveté, Varamo fails to recognize the most banal of facts, which leaves the readers with questions about whether or not his perception of the world depends on wholly different senses than those of a normal human.
A curious aspect in the construction of the novel, however, is its over-arching discourse concerning avant-garde artwork. Instead of trying to demystify the artistic merit of modern art, Aira chooses to explain the making of this art as the result of mere accidents, since Varamo’s account of this day is transformed into a celebrated poem. Aira’s stubborn and indefatigable attitude casts shadows over society’s supposedly deteriorating sense of art over the past century. One might even interpret this determination—through which Varamo has, by pure chance, created a masterpiece—as a mockery of the critics of the modernist institutions, who defend traditional artistic values and who would rather see a return to traditional artwork. It is more likely, however, that Aira aspires to bring out how avant-garde daily life is; there is not a single doubt about the greatness and significance of the poem “The Song of the Virgin Child,” despite its absence in the novel. Yet the fact that its mystical and surreal subject matter comes from real life means that one compelling element of it—its supposed creativity—is nothing more than an illusion.
“Varamo” is a short ride of quotidian wonders and the exceptional story that leads to these wonders—with an intellectual twist. Through vivid descriptions of the most extraordinary of circumstances, Aira explores the background of one man’s myth-like literary creation. The story will lead the reader to start asking fundamental questions about myths in the arts and the myths everyone grew up with. For Aira himself, it’s not so much who you are that matters, but what happens to you.

When I was younger, I was an obsessive mixtape maker. This pastime was my first to be rendered anachronistic by rapidly advancing digital technology, and so I remember it with pleasure. In the kitchen, my family had a tall black structure with irregularly placed shelves, one of which held a combination cassette player, radio, and phonograph—sort of a dunce’s corner when it comes to current music technologies. When the weather warmed and school days became a thing of the past, I would become preoccupied with the making of mixtapes for drives to my grandfather’s house in Cape Cod.
I would load a favorite tape into Tape Player A and a blank cassette into Tape Player B. Inevitably fast-forwarding to midway through my favorite song, I’d back up to the beginning, and record the track onto the new tape. As it recorded, I’d listen and think about the trip to come. One March, I even collected my favorite summer traveling music and stashed it away until summer so, after such anticipation, it would feel all the better when I listened to it with the windows down.
I think that everybody does this personal categorizing on some level. Wake-up music is not the same as break-up music, just as work-out music is not going-out music. Of all the songs within my own summer genre, renowned slide guitarist Derek Trucks’ cover of “Gonna Move” by Paul Pena is perhaps the epitome of summer music.
The only official recording of the Derek Trucks version is a "Bootleg" from a show at Georgia Theatre. Trucks starts the progression timidly—building from a muted root, to a slightly more wild second, to an unleashed fourth, and back to a slightly more defiant root. The bass and drums kick in, and an organ sweeps the band into a jaunty clip. The group rides this chord progression while lead singer Mike Mattison recounts Pena’s simply told tale of growing up and moving out. The chord progression reflects the theme admirably—each iteration builds upon the last, as if every ascent gains slightly more ground in an ever forward shuffle. The song is always leaving—moving away from the root with evident joy.
Derek Trucks is simultaneously one of the greatest live improvisers and one of music’s most timid stage presences. As a slide guitarist, he wears a glass cylinder on his finger that enables him to play in-between notes, so when he slides into a note he hits exactly every tone that precedes it. Trucks begins each phrase with the hot, crunching noise of his slide ascending to the proper note, and his riffs are characterized by a reliable progression along a tonal spectrum: they begin as harsh, indiscriminate crunches, and then move closer and closer to pure, tender single notes, often gaining slight vibrato towards the end. Each phrase is then answered by a companion—more or less the same idea with one alteration, picking up on the previously established pattern and mutating it slightly.
Though each note is born of many, his early riffs are comprised of single notes, not chords. As the solo reaches its peak, the organist plays successively higher inversions of the chords, and Trucks moves higher and higher up the neck. Mattison belts the chorus, and Trucks quotes the first half of the melody before suddenly dropping away from it to slide into an unexpected, almost gospel chord that sounds like an impassioned, harmonized hum. The song comes to an abrupt halt, but Trucks keeps playing, his guitar crunching and sighing. As the residual band noise fades, his guitar rides a single strum to a breathless low note. Then it rises in a sliding chord, as the bombastic introduction to the Looney Tunes theme song, and the band returns for one last celebratory hit.
This song perfectly fulfilled a certain common criterion on my playlists. A friend of mine once observed that you can hear someone smile when they sing, and, less frequently, when they play an instrument. It’s this intangible sound that Trucks’ rendition of “Gonna Move” so clearly embodies—an openness, a hope, a confident glee. The song is successful because of its infinite regression: At the broadest level, its lyrics pose a theme of leaving with the hope of a better life. On the minutest level, Trucks’ guitar solo is built of many small departures. No note is simply played—all are suggested by an approach that seamlessly becomes another departure. The song’s joyousness lies in its hopeful promise and the perfect unity of all the parts converging to convey the same confident message that is nowhere clearer than in the electric shrieks of Derek Trucks’ Gibson SG. His solos are all journey and never arrival—assertions of build and anticipation over climax; the joy of leaving in hope over staying in despair.

Some albums find you when you need them the most, and “Franks Wild Years” found me about a week after I graduated high school. In many ways it is a funny record for an obsessive Tom Waits fan like myself to latch onto. It is generally considered the weakest of the three experimental albums Waits recorded in the mid-eighties, after he quit playing the piano music that defined his early career. Not to imply that Pitchfork.com is the arbiter of all musical taste, but “Swordfishtrombones” and “Rain Dogs,” the two other works that heralded this turn in Waits’ music, placed 11th and eighth, respectively, on that influential music blog’s list of the “Top 100 Albums of the 1980s.”
“Franks Wild Years” did not even make it into the top hundred. It is subtitled “Un Operachi Romantico in Two Acts” and grew out of a fairly unsuccessful play Waits staged at Chicago’s Briar Street Theatre in 1986. It gained a small bump in popularity after the song “Way Down in the Hole” was used as the theme for the HBO series “The Wire,” but apart from that the album for the most part has slipped into obscurity.
But none of that mattered to the terrified teenager who was about to move 3,500 miles away from home in London to the United States. I spent the beginning of the summer after graduation putting on a brave face for my parents—as I am sure they were doing for me—and drinking cheap wine with my friends. As those June days dragged on and my friends began to leave home one after another, I realized just what a momentous transition I was about to endure. That is precisely when the beautifully discordant, haunting, and melodic “Franks Wild Years” found me.
“Wild Years” struck me as incredibly honest. Waits is legendary for his exceptionally gravelly voice, but on this album his usual gruffness is transformed into a mournful wail, the type it is impossible to fake. As I listened to him pour his heart out in “Innocent When You Dream (Barroom)” and “Train Song” during those balmy summer nights riding home on the Tube for yet another going away party, I would take comfort in this honesty. It felt like he had found the courage to share his deepest sorrows and frustrations with his audience. His voice, combined with that brassy, vaudeville sound, gave me the space I needed to think through my own anxieties about leaving home and the possibility of slowly drifting from the friends who helped me survive high school.
That summer it seemed like my life revolved around “Franks Wild Years.” I listened to it in the car and on the flight from London to Boston. I bought a vinyl reissue of it on Amazon.com so that I could play it on my new turntable. I even found a way of playing “Cold Cold Ground” on my cello, holding the instrument horizontally and strumming it like a guitar. I would sing along, doing my best to impersonate Wait’s bourbon-soaked voice. (I don’t smoke and back then I couldn’t stand whiskey, so I could never quite achieve the intended effect.) Perhaps most tellingly, I would always give myself a minute to reflect after hearing “Train Song,” the penultimate track on the record. It narrates the final chapter of the concept album’s protagonist Frank, who after reaching the stars and crashing back to earth like the all-American Icarus he is, finds himself broken and alone on a train hurtling through the midwestern countryside.
Now, three years after my original run in with “Franks Wild Years,” I still have fond memories for it. Although I shudder with embarrassment when I think of myself strumming my cello, I still do occasionally work through some of these songs on my guitar, and like a toddler making truck noises when playing with toy cars, I try to impersonate Waits’ signature growl when I sing along.

There is a tenuous balance between self-image and the body as it appears to the rest of the world. For some, maintaining that balance becomes an ongoing battle, an obsessive and consuming compulsion to remain in control of what is displayed to the public: the reflection in the mirror.
For artist Judith Shaw, whose exhibition “Body of Work” came to the Student Organizaton Center at Hilles last Thursday through the Eating Concerns Hotline and Outreach, the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, the Peer Contraceptive Councilors, and Sexual Health and Education and Advocacy Throughout Harvard organizations, that inner conflict manifested itself in a 15 year struggle with anorexia. When she could finally admit that she needed help, she found that creative self-expression brought her closer to being at peace with herself. She began creating sculptures and cutouts that reflected the stages of pain, acceptance, and confrontation that she experienced during her recovery—a recovery that remains a work-in-progress much like her burgeoning catalogue of work.
“Recovery is not something that’s over and done with,” Shaw said during the speakers’ panel that followed the opening of the exhibition in the penthouse of the SOCH. Continuing to create art, Shaw added, helps keep her focused on moving forward.
“We each have the opportunity to create ourselves and create our lives,” Shaw said. To Shaw, recovery also means recreation—a chance to start anew, rediscover equilibrium, and discard feelings of worthlessness, feelings she had chosen to mask with the numbness that anorexia cultivated. Her art developed along parallel lines with her therapy. The first piece she created during treatment, “Running on Empty,” features cut-out words and phrases that expressed the inner turmoil that accompanied her throughout her battle with anorexia contained in a life-sized cardboard cutout of her own body. A newspaper clipping saying nothing but “Help wanted” glared out from the collection of words—it is something Shaw found herself unable to say for 15 years.
“What I wish someone had said to me was, ‘I miss you,’” Shaw said. She recalled feeling isolated and uncertain, emotions reflected in similar cutouts filled with puzzle pieces and boxes peppered with holes that represented the lack of connection and acceptance Shaw felt in the throes of anorexia.
Some Harvard undergraduates who attended the event also believed that people should be more open to having a discussion about self-image issues despite the sensitive nature of the topic. “I think it’s rarely talked about on campus, so an art show is a really beautiful way to open up a conversation about it,” Madalyn S. Bates ’14 said. Hearing speakers talk about their personal experiences with eating disorders and creative expression also revealed new ways to think about the relationship between art and self-perception.
“One of the speakers phrased it in a really interesting way that I hadn’t thought of, which was that your body is yours—but also exists in the outside world—and it has expectations from other people,” Bates said. “It’s a meeting place between who you think you are and who the rest of the world thinks you are, so to see this meeting place represented in art is very meaningful.”
Sara S. Lytle ’13, who contributed to the student exhibit and spoke at the event, noted that the artistic representations of that meeting place between art and self-perception are capable of addressing more than eating disorders. “These issues are not just about eating disorders. They’re also about what it means to be human, to be flawed,” Lytle told the audience, adding she believed that creativity comes out of imperfection. “A moving photograph—a beautiful one—does not have to be of a perfect image.”
Lytle’s photography was accompanied by sketches, paintings, sculptures, and other photographs produced by Harvard students. Each piece conveyed a message about various ideas of self-image, including gender identity and self-alteration as well as eating disorders. Though the media and messages of the student work and Shaw’s pieces may have varied, the common themes of self-acceptance, and the forward movement towards inner peace remained.
“In my experience, [recovery] is more of an art than a science,” Shaw said. According to Shaw, the creation of art thus becomes more than a way to express and move past the suffering that an eating disorder entails: it is also an expression of hope, an optimistic view of a new future, and a reminder that even recovery—with its own setbacks and obstacles—is an imperfect journey.

The lecture hall in the Carpenter Center is packed with an audience expecting to hear about the work of one of the most prominent Arab artists in the world. What they get is something unexpected: not a conventional lecture about Lebanese artist Walid Raad’s work but an hour-long talk in which Raad recreates the simultaneously real and false narratives that lie behind his artistic approach.
Raad is known for blurring the lines betwen truth and fiction in his artwork. Visual and Environmental Studies professor Carrie Lambert-Beatty alludes to this when she warns the audience that Raad is “disarming.”
A member of the audience commented at the end of the lecture, “I totally suspended my disbelief when I wasn’t supposed to.... Everything he said was so believable.”
Walid Raad now lives in New York and is deeply interested in the intersections between memory and history and between fiction and reality. His work is  influenced by the traumatic events of the Lebanese civil war of 1975-1991, which he uses as a backdrop in some of his stories.
Raad begins his talk by providing an overview on his works in the past decades. Raad created the most well-known of his projects under the name of “The Atlas Group,” an imaginary foundation dreamed up by Raad that features the work of both real and fictional artists.
The foundation is entitled “The Atlas Group 1989-2004” but Raad is quick to inform the audience that the name is misleading: He continues to work on the project today, but all works will be assigned a production date between 1989-2004. A prominent figure is Dr Fakhouri, a historian who bequeathed his works to The Atlas Group—but Dr. Fakhouri is a fictional character.
Then, under dimmed lights and dressed in black, Raad begins to tell the first of four stories he will share during the night. The narratives seem credible, or at least he is a consummate performer.
Some of his tales sound more absurd than others. One of his stories concerns his reluctance to exhibit his work in Beirut. Finally, after repeated petitions, he relented in 2008 and agreed to exhibit his work at the Sfeir-Semler gallery. But as he prepared for opening, a strange phenomenon takes place: All his works shrink to a hundredth of their original size. Other stories about the Artist Pension Trust, “the most beautiful man [Raad] had ever seen,” disappearing colors of the future, and invisible art works bewitch the audience.
His stories seem stranger than fiction, yet so much is grounded in what he calls “historical fact” that his world transforms into an incredible place where anything is possible. His seamless intertwining of truth and fiction seeks to question the audience’s conviction in the importance of fact and the steadfastness of logic.
Director of the Carpenter Center David Rodowick comments that he doesn’t “know of any other artist doing [what Raad] is doing contemporarily.” Raad’s work, he says, is “extremely grounded in history.... He keeps sourcing [his work] like a historian, but you never quite know what is true and what is not.” In this realm of indiscernible truth and fiction, the audience has little idea of what is real and what isn’t. Or perhaps they are relegated to a state of unimportance.
Raad is confronted by a member of the audience who challenges the veracity of his lecture at the end of the talk. She shouts out microphoneless and nervous: “You’re a great storyteller, whether your stories are true or not.”
Raad’s response is perhaps rehearsed to seem unrehearsed. He replies simply, “I seem to always work with facts, and sometimes these are historical facts.” His lecture is far more than an informatory talk: doubtless, we are informed about his work and the state of the contemporary art world, but the lecture is an experience that profoundly tests the audience’s credibility.

Partying on and off the set, visiting Disneyland, and feeling hung over—just another day in the lives of the stars of the upcoming film “Project X.” Thomas Mann and Jonathan D. Brown talk about their experience during the filming of “Project X,” which chronicles the 17th birthday party of nice guy Thomas  (Mann) and the hijinks that follow. Co-star Brown plays JB, a shy self-proclaimed “fat Jew.”
The Harvard Crimson: Your characters in the movie seem very close. How did you develop a relationship?
Jonathan D. Brown: Hanging out with each other.
Thomas Mann: The only preparation we did was hanging out with each other and building a history so that the chemistry works on-screen. They set up little “play dates” for us.
JDB: Disneyland.
TM: Yeah, we went to Disneyland.
JDB: We took initiative too. We were like, “Let’s go get Chinese food!”
TM: We went to Big Bear [a mountain getaway in California] one weekend.
JDB: We bonded. We still hang out. TM: All the time. This [movie] is a big thing that ties us together.
THC: There must have been plenty of competition for a role in a movie like this. How did you end up getting cast?
TM: They did a nation-wide talent search, and a lot of people submitted…[over] 3000 videos, tape submissions, which is how this guy (points to Jonathan) got cast.
JDB: Yeah, I did an open call audition over the internet. I saw a random blog that said “casting” and I’m like “Okay.” I had no real acting experience. I was actually pursuing stand-up. It snowballed from there. Three months and nine auditions later, I got it. A brutal gauntlet of tests. I lucked out.
TM: It was an audition for me. I ended up going in seven or eight times. It was tough.
JDB: Going three weeks without hearing anything is like a punch in the gut.
TM: It was like an emotional roller coaster.
JDB: The movie’s better for that brutal process.
THC: Critics and viewers will undoubtedly label this film a “party movie.” Does it have a more significant meaning?
TM: It’s an experience. It’s a real feast for the eyes.
JDB: But I think there is an element of commentary about the social structure in high school.
TM: It’s important for it to stay grounded… Costa’s [the actors’ third co-star] character is big, and he’s the instigator.
JDB: We all know someone like him; everyone knows a Costa, a jackass like him. TM: And there are kids like Thomas who are more shy and reserved. They want to get out of their shell but are too afraid to take the risk.
JDB: And then there’s a fat Jewish kid.
THC: Why is the movie called “Project X?”
JDB: Working title that stuck.
TM: It’s the idea that they decided to document the party and gave it the name “Project X.”
JDB: That’s why Costa calls it “Project X.”
TM: It sounds like a top-secret mission.
THC: The dialogue in the film sounds authentic. How much of it was scripted and how much was improvised?
TM: There was a lot of improvising in rehearsals.
JDB: Not as much in the movie.
TM: Once we were cast they rewrote the script for our specific voices. We would shoot as it was written.  Then we had some room to play.
JDB: There were two credited writers: Matt Drake and Michael Bacall. Bacall came up with the story then they wrote the script together. Then there was the on-set writer who played a massive role in changing the characters to our tune.
TM: There was a lot of rewriting on the day. It was spontaneous.
JDB: Even though it’s a movie, it is borderline interactive.
TM: The idea is to make you feel like you’re there. Even though it’s a “found footage film,” it’s stylized.
JDB: No shaky camera holding. If you go out [of the theater] and feel hung over, you won’t feel nauseous, you’ll just feel tired. You feel beat.
TM: Yeah, you feel exhausted afterwards. The movie is so fast paced.
THC: What is your favorite song from the movie?
TM: “Heads Will Roll (A-Trak Remix)” by Yeah Yeah Yeahs.
JDB: “Pursuit of Happiness (Steve Aoki Remix)” by Kid Cudi. It’s kind of the unofficial anthem of the movie.

It is easy to overlook an inconspicuous door to the smallest part of the Visual and Environmental Studies department tucked away on a quiet corner of Linden Street. Yet the Monday Gallery—the first student-run gallery at Harvard—opened on March 5 with a flashy reception that attracted over 150 people. The Monday Gallery is a permanent space in which students concentrating in VES can showcase their work. The gallery itself represents more than just a space to display artwork; it shows off the other talents of the students that organized it.
“There was a serious gap in the VES structure, as there was no place students could submit and showcase their artwork. There were events like Arts First and end-of-the-semester shows...but the VES concentrators wanted something more,” said Daniel R. Bredar ’14, a co-curator of the Monday Gallery. The gallery may even help students fulfill acedemic requirements. Seniors on the studio track in the VES department are expected to display some of their artwork as part of their thesis. “Students need to be able to envision the work they are making in time and space, in a destination,” said Avery A. Leonard ’14, artist and co-curator of the Monday Gallery. However, they often have little hands-on experience in creating a show. “The Monday Gallery is an opportunity for us to acquire and practice the managerial and technical skills needed to install work and view art with a new literacy for the mechanics of how [the art] got there,” Avery said.
The interior of the gallery is elegant in its whitewashed walls and clean-cut lines. Yet this simplicity hides the laborious efforts that went into the making of this gallery. “We painted all the walls white, replaced lightbulbs in the ceilings, got submissions, sorted through them, picked out what worked....We spent three to four hours over the course of two days trying to figure what should go where,” Bredar said in reference to the five-person team that founded the gallery. This was no easy feat, especially given the short period of 12 days that they had to convert what was initially a room for senior thesis concentrators into a full-blown gallery. The small gallery held its opening reception on February 27. The gallery also gave the VES students an opportunity to understand firsthand what it what it would be like to work on the other end of the spectrum as a curator instead of an artist. “It’s a lot of hard work. You have to figure out publicity, logos, installing the artwork.... I knew it would be overwhelming, intense, and a huge learning experience, but preparing for the exhibition made it real,” said  Kayla A. Escobedo ’13, an artist and another co-curator of the gallery.
The curators are looking to add more media with which visitors can connect. “We are looking at bringing a more interactive feel to the gallery experience [to] fill the gap between gallery art and performing art,” Bredar said. To jumpstart the process, the curators provided peanuts in artfully designed containers during the opening reception as a pun on the phrase “peanut gallery.” The co-curators said they hoped to create more avenues for the spectators to connect with the art exhibited more personally.
The gallery, while originally a mere vessel to display various artists’ works, is itself an exercise in creativity. The opening of the gallery is akin to the unveiling of an artwork. Just as an artist conceptualizes an idea and seeks to express it through his art form, so did the five curators start with an idea and bring it to fruition through unwavering dedication. The student-run gallery maintains an air of professinalism which puts the gallery on par with the more established galleries on campus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“If I were the night sky / Here’s my lullaby,” sings Andrew Bird in deep, drawn-out vocals on his latest CD, “Break It Yourself,” a stunning and mature album that provokes more contemplation than his lighthearted previous releases. What the album sometimes lacks in accessible hooks and Bird’s signature syllabic experimentation it makes up for with a streamlined musical focus on harmony and a lyrical focus on mortality and love. The album is a nature-inspired lullaby whose reflective material gently lulls the reader into the morbid and beautiful mind of Andrew Bird himself.
While many of Bird’s older albums were dominated by songs with stunning and dense internal rhyme schemes like “Fake Palindromes,” “Break It Yourself” forgoes intricate phonetic craft in favor of vivid imagery and instrumental intricacies. “I didn’t know that your love was a commodity,” he sings to a former lover. “What about appreciation? That depends on your depth and density / What about inflation? Charts and graphs don’t mean nothing to me / In your nation with its worthless currency.” There are few other songwriters who could so creatively string together a girlfriend-as-an-industrialized-country metaphor.
In the second half of the album, Bird shifts his focus to a careful construction of musical soundscapes. His extensive musical environments consisting of little more than a violin are particularly compelling; in musical interludes like that in “Things Behind the Barn,” for example, high-pitched and looping strings encapsulate the eerie abandonment of a rural farm at dusk. And the final track of the album, “Belles,” is a wordless song of ringing wind chimes and crickets.
The undeniable tour-de-force of the album is “Orpheo Looks Back,” the only track that approaches, on its own, the iconic brilliance of nostalgic, lovelorn older songs like “The Trees Were Mistaken.” Bird builds this recursive, violin-based track on the Greek myth of Orpheus, who tried to rescue his wife Eurydice from the underworld. Her return, however, was based on his agreement to never turn around during their journey; when Orpheus became nervous and turned to look at her, he lost her forever. “When Orpheo keeps on straining,” Bird wonders, “Is it to see what lies behind her / Through the shells of empty buildings and great columns of glass? / Say you don’t look, say you don’t look / ’Cause it’ll drive you mad.” The looping layers of violin slowly morph into dizzying rounds of repeated and layered lyrics, an innovative and gripping shift. Bird’s singing, whistling, and fiddling come together to enthusiastic effect.
The most unexpected aspect of the album, however, is Bird’s balancing act as he explores the thin line between life and death. “Near Death Experience Experience” finds him tempting fate: “So you dare the plane to crash / Redeem the miles for cash / When it starts to dive,” he sings against an upbeat percussive background. “And we’ll dance like cancer survivors, like we’re grateful simply to be alive.” Yet not all is immortal hubris: in the slower, hypnotic “Fatal Shore,” Bird contemplates the afterlife with oceanic imagery: “When are you coming to shore, coming to shore? To never fear any more, fear any more?” He loops and repeats the lyrics with fading whistles and pulsing drumbeats to create a mesmerizing virtual hypnosis.
The main flaw in “Break It Yourself” is the relative weakness of the album’s second half; for an artist who clearly puts so much thought into arrangement and lyricism, the album takes a long time to settle into its thematic concepts. Yet the folksy fiddler has never engineered albums for easy listening—and who can deny the observational genius of a man who contemplates how “the moon plays the ocean like a violin?” Like the pervasive imagery of nature throughout the album, “Break It Yourself” is haphazardly organized yet beautiful in effect.

Ken Marino and David Wain’s latest collaboration features a young married couple, George (Paul Rudd) and Linda (Jennifer Aniston). Debating whether to buy an apartment in New York City, George asks his wife, “Is this where you want to be?” Linda responds, “This is where we need to be.” The universal question of “Where is home, really?” is answered loyally with the long-awaited conclusion that home is where the other dwells, whether in New York or elsewhere. Despite this predictability and the slightly disappointing lack of chemistry between Rudd and Aniston, “Wanderlust” entertains with feel-good hilarity that weaves between the values of corporate America and a simple, “hippie” happiness.
After George is fired from his corporate job, the couple ditches their newly-acquired apartment to move in with George’s brother (Ken Marino) and his family in Atlanta, but a night at a bed and breakfast called Elysium on the way makes them consider other options. Elysium is a commune although its leader Seth (Justin Theroux) says, “We prefer ‘intentional community. We’re not a bunch of hippies sitting around playing guitar.” Gradually, George and Linda’s initial repulsion by the nudity of a community member turns into appreciation of the lifestyle after getting high, stomping grapes, and battling with guitars.
Alternating between the impersonal, suburban, corporate-climbing home of George’s brother Rick, and the no-doors, no-leaders, free love mantra of Elysium, “Wanderlust” argues that America needs to become less materialistic. George takes a nuanced approach to the hippie lifestyle of his new friends in Elysium:
“Just remember, money buys nothing…literally,” Seth says.
“Don’t you mean metaphorically?”George responds. \
“No. Literally,” says Seth.
Insanely long awkward moments in which neither the characters nor the viewers know whether or not to laugh add to the film’s humor. When George tells the landlady at Elysium his name, she asks if he brought John, Paul, and Ringo with him. He says he didn’t. But she stares at him quietly before insisting, “Not even Ringo?” He again says no. And she keeps staring. Before we figure out what exactly is going on, the scene suddenly cuts.
In this way, “Wanderlust” keeps a straight face and is funny in the process. The script is self-aware, with characters throwing out lines that make it obvious that the audience is laughing with them, not at them. Snippets like “Monogamy is sexual slavery” and “We’ve got to protest!” are delivered semi-seriously, and the production as a whole laughs at itself when Seth makes his first appearance in the film carrying a goat around his neck. Bringing this sort of fresh perspective into its stereotypes, “Wanderlust” plays with a relatable struggle for balance between the worlds of different priorities and thus has the potential for depth.
However, while George and Linda are supposed to be the measure of normalcy in the caricatured film, they are unconvincing as husband and wife. For example, their trip to Elysium is shot in a series of jump cuts—with George driving and Linda yelling, then with Linda driving and George sleeping, and then with them both singing to the radio—that illustrate a comfortable rapport, but Rudd and Aniston’s childish antics do not indicate that they’re more than just old friends.
It is especially surprising that despite this particular mash-up of actors—Rudd and Aniston successfully co-starred in “The Object of My Affection”—the chemistry between the couple was just not there. It seems that too much familiarity has caused this on-screen couple to rely on the positive reception of their prior film to do the job for them. What could have been a poignant comedy by its perceptive portrayal of American life remained instead just a laugh-out-loud movie with some of modern comedy’s favorite actors.

I learned more about how to make art from the Henri-Georges Clouzot documentary “Le Mystère Picasso” than I learned from any previous semester-long painting class. The 1956 documentary is entirely dedicated to recording how Picasso draws and paints. Some of the scenes show him drawing with thick markers that bleed through his paper, so that to the camera, filming from the backside of a glass easel, the lines seem to be making themselves. For paintings where this through-glass approach does not work, the filmmakers take dozens of still images of the painting as it progresses.
 
To me, then a beginner artist in a studio art class freshman year, Picasso’s process seemed truly alarming. He draws something beautiful—the head of a goat, for example—and puts it through a wringer of destructive changes, going much further than it seems like any sane artist should.
 
For the goat, which can be seen on YouTube under the title “Le Mystère Picasso 1,” Picasso begins with a weird, gestural, lively, and sympathetic pen drawing—already an artwork in its own right. Then he fills in the background with crude swaths of red, blue, and yellow, disturbing the delicacy and humor of his drawing. Next he covers the drawing by building up the goat’s head in gray, black, and white paint, patterning the fur with ornate strokes of neutral tones. The work is beautiful again; if I were him I would stop there. But then he wipes out all his careful patterning and replaces it with a few angular marks on the goat’s cheek and nose: a third beautiful stage, and distinctly Picasso—but of course he keeps going. He builds up the background, obliterates it, and replaces it with trees and flowers. He exaggeratedly shrinks and bends the goat’s neck, making it into something closer to a caricature, then he builds up the face again with busy lines. And then, finally, he stops. 
 
This is not even an extreme example; the drawing that he changes from a fish to a rooster to a human face is much worse. Each one of his drawings and paintings is shown to contain many hidden drawings and paintings underneath. From a starting point of sketchy realism, Picasso moves through stages of maximalism, simplicity, and cartoonishness to end up with something that defies any category. As you watch, you realize his genius.
 
Like every groundbreaking artist, Picasso does not stop at the merely good. He goes for the crazy. He blows things up. This compulsion strikes me as deeply courageous. He’s not afraid to lose what he has in favor of some unknown. He seems to be constantly striving for something no one has seen before—stranger, busier, less safe. He is a savage editor and an even more inventive creator. Picasso filled his whole life with creation, making use of everything, from a broken chair to a sardine skeleton, in his painting and sculpting. The documentary taught me to be bolder and to approach all things as accessible and mutable and better for being so.
 
With all this in mind, I have a proposal for a dorm room art project, if you want to try these things yourself and go beyond the good. Start at Utrecht, an art supply store up Massachusetts Avenue in the direction of Central Square. For less money than a dorm-room poster, you can buy a large sheet of watercolor paper, a medium-sized brush, and your favorite two or three bottles (or more) of colored ink—the Higgins brand is good. Ink is more portable and easier to clean than acrylic, and it dries faster. When you get back to your room, fill a cup with water and dampen your paper all over, which will make the ink easier to use and will cause lines spread with feathery edges. It doesn’t matter what you draw, or if you draw anything at all; you can just make shapes and lines. Wait for it to dry, and then mess up your favorite part, unbalance it, add a pattern or a central figure, cover something up. Do this over and over. At the end your paper will probably look like a huge mess. You should hang it up on your wall and step back.
 
The point of this activity, and the mystery of Picasso, is figuring out how to push beyond the boundaries of habit or taste or even beauty. No matter what your ink-painting looks like, your methods and your intentions make it something worth thinking about and talking about. You work on a loop of intuitive action and response, you blunder past blunders, you allow nothing timid or sacred.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week The Crimson ran a story that must have plunged a certain subset of the artsy elite into a tailspin. The article detailed potential plans to implement a university-wide smoking ban that would prohibit smoking on any part of Harvard’s campus. Difficulty of enforcement aside, one cannot help but feel that this policy deliberately targets a certain type of Harvard student for whom the decision to smoke is—much like wearing thick-framed glasses—a fundamental expression of artsiness. To be a young smoker in this day and age, and in this country, is no easy feat. In fact, being a smoker at Harvard is already well nigh impossible; the smoking table that used to serve as a perch for smokers of Kirkland and Eliot Houses is no more, and smoking is not allowed in the immediate vicinity of the houses, so smokers have to stand in the street in ignominy, puffing away under the disapproving eyes of passersby.
 
It was not always thus. As recently as the late eighties, there was a separate smoking room in the Freshman Union, the predecessor to Annenberg. Can you imagine? An annex of the freshman dining hall only for smokers? You must be joking, you say dismissively. But I am not joking. I am merely relating historical fact. We are students in a health-conscious age in which students are more likely to unroll a yoga mat than to roll a cigarette. “Smoking is a disgusting habit,” said one student who asked to remain anonymous. “Harvard students should know better.” And so they do. Most smokers in the world, not to mention smokers at Harvard, are aware of the seriously detrimental effects of the habit. So, to smoke in college, I would argue, is a decision to disregard the prudent advice of parents, doctors, and friends and to take some sort of social stand.
 
This is an oversimplification, of course. Harvard students smoke for a number of reasons. Some students I spoke to adopted the habit from their parents. Others picked it up while studying abroad in Europe, where the vice is so much more common and really not considered a vice, after all. The “artsy,” so often the target of this column, smoke because they associate the behaviour with the kinds of people they aspire to be—intellectuals, actors, painters, and the like. 
 
Condemning the habit is easy but lays one open to hypocrisy. The student quoted above supports the plan to make Harvard’s campus smoke free. She is a resident of Kirkland House, and her ground-floor window opens onto the single sliver of pavement that Kirkland smokers now use in the absence of the aforementioned table. She asked for anonymity, however, because she confided that those smokers outside her window are her friends, and she does not want to offend them. Her respect for their feelings is touching, but it does not seem to influence her support of a policy that would make it impossible for them to smoke.
 
I am against the smoke-free Harvard policy, not because I think smoking is cool, but rather because I think the policy is profoundly inconsistent and even hypocritical. Smoking used to be an integral part of being at college and even to being a Harvard student. The Freshman Union’s smoking room is a testament to that fact. Moreover, the ongoing archaeological dig in the Yard has unearthed countless antique tobacco pipe stems. Even when it was officially banned from campus during Harvard’s Puritan era, smoking was still a common habit among students. Perhaps those among us who choose to light up are simply upholding a centuries-old tradition.
 
Drinking has always been an integral part of being a college student, and yet the University seems to have no problem with this activity—its amnesty policy demonstrates an institutional acknowledgment that students are prone to drink—actually, to drink quite a lot. Drinking to excess is arguably as harmful to one’s health as smoking. And yet, while the college does try to prevent underage drinking, its alcohol policy is relatively lenient. Can you imagine if Harvard announced plans to become an alcohol-free campus? There would be outrage, uproar, and chaos. Just as drinking defines many Harvard students’ social interactions, so smoking, too, is important to some students’ self-identification. Yes, it’s bad for you. But drinking isn’t great either. People still do it, and trying to change that is as futile as trying to light a cigarette in a strong headwind.

“There’s a midget trapped in the oven!” a partygoer screams over the din of hundreds of partying teenagers.
“What are they saying?” the party’s host yells out.
“I don’t know. All I heard was midget and oven,” his friend responds.
“Project X,” the newest tribute to the drugs, alcohol, sex, loud music, and promiscuous dancing of unruly youth life lifts all normal party behavior to an unbelievable extreme. However, the fresh, uncensored portrayal of high school shenanigans, including the green cast and documentary-style filming, creates an enjoyable film geared towards Generation Y.
Set in suburban California, the film employs a faux-documentary style that follows Thomas (Thomas Mann), Costa (Oliver Cooper), and JB (Jonathan Daniel Brown), three friends who feel invisible in their school’s hierarchy. Costa and JB decide to throw Thomas a birthday party that is “big enough to be cool” thus gaining the admiration of their peers. Thomas’ parents leave for the weekend, and Costa, his gregarious Queens-born friend, spreads the word via Craigslist, the radio, Facebook, and Twitter. He publicizes the party with “unlimited high school girls” so effectively that thousands of drunk and crazy people descend into Thomas’ family-friendly neighborhood.
Cinematographically, the set of the party looks amazingly out of control.If only people in high school have parties as outrageous as Thomas, Costa, and JB, the need for these types of escapist movies would be nil. The movie tries to channel a sort of Playboy Mansion vibe—topless girls in the pool, aforementioned midget Verne Troyer, a gnome stuffed with Ecstasy, and a DJ pumping a sick soundtrack. Granted, the size of the party is somewhat unbelievable. However, the majority of the movie is enjoyable and fun because it seems so genuine, a feeling created by the documentary aspect of the cinematography as well as the cast.
Thomas Mann, Oliver Cooper, and Jonathan Daniel Brown used their real names in the movie, and Brown was actually cast through an online audition process. All brand-new to Hollywood, they maintain their not-yet-jaded demeanors during the filming. They are able to play high-schoolers because they attended real high schools, instead of being tutored on sets. They all have great chemistry between them, and thus, their friendship doesn’t seem forced. Due to the fact that there are no headlining actors or big names—besides the producer, Todd Phillips, who directed “The Hangover”—the movie’s ambiance is solely based on the ridiculous scenario as a “celebration of bad behavior.”
Moreover, unlike other movies based in high school, there aren’t unbelievably witty people who speak as adults in children’s bodies—think the characters of “Cruel Intentions”—or generalized cheerleaders or nerds. The people in the movie talk and dance like people in high schools across the country and thus provide a seemingly uncensored picture of America. They swear, talk about “finger banging,” strategize about how to seduce a girl by “telling her how pretty she is,” grind to music, and play flip cup. Despite the sometimes juvenile nature of the film’s content, it did not seem as if it was trying to aim for anything more than its goal: a somewhat journalistic account of an unusual event.
There are really no bounds in the dialogue or storyline, for that matter. In that way, the party ultimately unwinds from believable-but-insane rager to an unreal catastrophe. Riot police and a crazy drug dealer wielding a flamethrower are involved, and it the plot unraveled into an absurd scenario. However, although this craziness mars the aforementioned ‘honest’ feeling, at least a sort of moral message is upheld with the party-throwers suffering the consequences. College funds are spent on rebuilding houses and Thomas was brought up on six charges, but he is a legend at his high school. The epic party is still a night to remember for the young protagonists. So even though the appreciated realistic qualities of the film are squandered by the end of the movie, it was refreshing to see the repercussions, unlike wondering what happened to the tattoo on Stu’s face after “The Hangover II.”
“Project X” is a movie strictly for Generation Y. Baby boomers might not appreciate the visions of suburban homes up in flames all due to an irresponsible party, but young adults might appreciate the relatively realistic and impressive rager, if only vicariously. Although the movie suffers from a bout of unbelievability, it is still a good depiction of our generation’s culture.

The almost spooky balance of order and spontaneity in tenor saxophonist John Coltrane’s “A Love Supreme” is most easily discernible in a passage near the end of its first movement, entitled “Acknowledgment.” After persistently developing minor pentatonic themes across a dense and determined solo, Coltrane settles down into a musical trance. Taking the iconic, three-note theme of the movement over which the words “a love supreme” are later chanted, Coltrane modulates from key to key, traveling through all 12 keys of Western harmony. He jumps erratically, choosing none of the symmetric intervals that could dutifully carry him through the spectrum of keys; nonetheless, he is still able to reach every key, which suggests an intense deliberation or some kind of mysterious, prepared framework. The passage seems too disorderly to be planned, but too unified to be improvised.
This tension is central to the entire jazz idiom, but it is difficult, and most likely impossible, to locate a more astonishingly perfect balance than that found in “A Love Supreme,” Coltrane’s open letter to God. The album is the music of passion, even rapture, held within a divine formal unity. It rewards both visceral and microscopic listening and has remained the musical favorite of a wide swath of listeners even while persistently hiding many of the most fundamental secrets behind its own construction. In a master class on Monday evening, Quincy Jones Professor of African American Music Ingrid Monson attempted to crack some of the secrets of the 1964 classic by examining many individual moments that hint at its intricate formal mechanics.
Coltrane communicated the concept of “A Love Supreme” to his fellow musicians as a vague blueprint with plenty of room for experimentation. However, Monson notes that Coltrane had much more concrete intentions. “Coltrane arrived in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey [studio of famed producer Rudy Van Gelder],” Monson said, “with a plan in mind for a four-movement work. He gave the musicians some general chord progressions and some general instructions, but they knew that these were simply guidelines. They knew in the end that they would be following Coltrane and each other.” In one four-hour session on December 9, 1964, Coltrane and his famed rhythm section—McCoy Tyner on piano, Jimmy Garrison on bass, and Elvin Jones on drums—hammered out one of the greatest and most enduring jazz albums ever created. “There is a power in capturing a very particularly fine improvisational moment,” said Monson about the session. As much as Coltrane wanted his group, whose minds were practically linked after three years of playing together, to run free, he had a clear vision of his piece which included many structural nuances.
Proceeding gradually through the recording, Monson revealed vast structural parallels that serve as the tendons and ligaments within the teeming, organic mass that is “A Love Supreme.” She highlighted several thematic connections, including an elaborate key structure, between movements and culminated with an unveiling of the final movement, “Psalm.” According to Monson, this movement—a heavy, monotonous, and rubato ballad—is the wordless recitation of a poem that Coltrane wrote in the LP’s liner notes without explanation. “The relationship of the words to the music was a bit of a secret to be discovered,” said Monson. “Not even the musicians in the band knew that he was using a text, which suggests that he had it memorized.” To reinforce her point, Monson projected the words on the screen behind her, then bounced a laser pointer over their syllables as “Psalm” played in the background. The master class had become a John Coltrane sing-along.
Without the knowledge that it is based on a text, “Psalm” sounds like the most meandering and unrehearsed movement of “A Love Supreme;” with the words in mind, it proves to be the most structured and poignant. In a moment of particular exaltation, Coltrane ascends into the upper reaches of his instrument as he wordlessly intones the words, “God is. He always was. He always will be.” Yet again, the work operates in a tenuous limbo wherein disorder proves to have secretly been the most divine form of order all along. “I think it’s part of the spiritual idea,” says Monson, “that those who were going to be attuned to this are going to get it. It’s as if to leave a mystical puzzle there for the listener to solve.” Whether spiritual puzzle or musical delight, Coltrane’s “A Love Supreme” still captivates and confounds almost 50 years after its release.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Bruce Springsteen has always been whomever he wanted with little regard to how others perceived him. Tapes from his early performances in the ’70s show a scrawny, mercurial collection of poorly recorded pixels shamelessly rambling with the clearly affected mannerisms of Bob Dylan and Van Morrison. In the ’80s, he became equal parts Rambo and lonesome cowboy on “Born in the U.S.A.” and “Tunnel of Love.”  Recently, the 62-year-old rock star has undergone yet another mutation away from the sheen of his late 20th-century work and toward the ramshackle style of early American folk singers. He’s cropped his hair close and donned a tight vest that makes him look like a folk doctor of suspect miracle cures in the Wild West.  On his most recent album, “Wrecking Ball,” he completes his transformation into an American folk hero and attempts to take on the recent economic downturn with all the vitriol and grizzled longing his years allow. The album, while at times overblown and shabbily executed, still possesses great energy and enthusiasm and manages to muster some of the old E Street Magic that has stayed constant throughout his career.
Perhaps it is unfair to expect subtlety from an album entitled “Wrecking Ball.” Springsteen, a proponent of the dense Wall of Sound production method, delivers his new, folkier sound in a paradoxically blown-up production. If anything, the production on this album is more like a larger, now-crumbling wall of sound.  New tonal flavors—like the liberally used fiddle and mandolin—accompany the centerpiece of Max Weinberg’s thunderous drums. Many of the tracks involve rowdy background singers that seem intended to give an “authentic” feel to Springsteen’s workingman’s romps. For instance, “Easy Money” rises to a celebratory hoedown, with fiddlers stomping behind a choir that sounds like it was recorded in a pub. “You put on your coat I’ll / Put on my hat / You put out the dog I’ll / Put out the cat,” sings Springsteen. This is an admirable attempt at modernized Depression-era folk protest music, but between the lazy lyricism and the cluttered production, the song comes across as forced.
Lyrics are a persistent problem on the record. Classic lines like “Mister, I ain’t a boy, no, I’m a man / And I believe in the promised land”—from 1978’s “Promised Land”—carefully walked the border between universality and triteness because Springsteen snuck them into keenly observed character studies and narratives. The lyrics of “Wrecking Ball” are embarrassingly earnest. On “Land of Hope and Dreams,” Springsteen sings the line “Big wheels roll through fields where sunlight streams / Meet me in a land of hope and dreams” twice. Lyrics like these can push an otherwise good, if gratuitous, song toward ridiculousness.
Despite these shortcomings, “Wrecking Ball” provides more glimpses of Springsteen’s former majesty than many of his recent efforts. The title track, which was written for the razing of Giants Stadium, conjures surprising pathos despite using football as a central metaphor for life. Otherwise cringe-inducing lines like “If you’ve got the guts, mister / Yeah if you’ve got the balls” seem like genuine assertions of character when coupled with the mighty refrain “Bring on yer wrecking ball.” The track powers its way through each triumphant build, bursting into horn-driven, double-time segments—always cued by Springsteen’s immortal count-offs—and pulling back to epic washes of distorted chords that are matched only by Springsteen’s own defiant bellow. Though this is an undeniably indulgent number, its own obvious faith in the redemption of rock and roll is enough to spur it on.
The album succeeds in spite of its excess because it recalls Springsteen’s best qualities, even if it only rarely achieves them. He’s called it his “angriest” album, but the E Street Band is having far too much fun on these tracks to come near the bare anger of Springsteen’s “Nebraska.”  All the paradoxes and shortcomings of the album are embodied in the climax, “Land of Hope and Dreams.” The song begins with absurd gospel belting accompanied by a portentous church organ. After several measures of an ’80s drum machine lower expectations even further, Springsteen’s guitar thrills with the power of the titular wrecking ball and ushers in martial drum rolls and a whirling rock organ. The group launches into a celebratory riff that ably expresses the song’s message of redemption. In a chilling moment, the late Clarence Clemons’s saxophone roars into a solo reminiscent of “Jungleland” to guide the track to its end. This last unheard recording suggests that, though Clemons may be gone, his gut-wrenching solos remain. Similarly, “Wrecking Ball” ably reminds of all the reasons Springsteen deserves the folk-hero treatment, even if it breaks no new ground.

The Magnetic Fields have carved out a niche in the indie world by constistently creating witty pop songs with infectious melodies. So it is disappointing that the melodies in the band’s newest release, “Love at the Bottom of the Sea,” are sorely lacking in lyrical ingenuity and musical complexity. Many of the melodies actually detract from the album’s few redeeming components. Though some of the instrumental arrangements are intriguing, the melodies are more representative of the quality of the album in general; “Love at the Bottom of the Sea” suffers from the same simple-mindedness and stagnancy as its underwhelming lyrics.
“Love at the Bottom of the Sea” is a collection of 15 two-minute-and-change snippets that never quite develop into full songs. Now and again, the album shows glimpse of the effortless whimsicality that has characterized the band’s career: “I’d Go Anywhere with Hugh” prances gaily for the entirety of its short life. The bass bounces from note to note while guitars playfully riff on various looping melodies. “I love Hugh and Hugh loves you / You love me, and he does not / I don’t love you and you don’t love Hugh / What a sad gavotte,” vocalist Shirley Simms sings, describing the love triangle in which she is caught. This is one of the few songs on the album in which the Magnetic Fields effectively uses light instrumentation to complement its light vocals to humorous effect.
While the album has other fleeting moments of bouyant simplicity, it cannot recover from lack of depth. “Love at the Bottom of the Sea” contains neither lyrical nor musical complexity. Though repetition and restraint can sometimes serve as assets, they lead in this case to a monotonous album. Most obviously damaging is the lack of thematic movement. The acclaimed and groundbreaking “69 Love Songs” possessed  a distinct ebb and flow, and the common themes that ran throughout made it cohesive. In contrast, “Love at the Bottom of the Sea” is little more than a choppy collection of songs that don’t relate beyond a vague theme of homosexuality.
The songs themselves suffer the same fate. Even the catchier ones, like “Andrew in Drag,” draw strength from Stephin Merritt’s humorous lyrics but are limited by their lack of internal growth. ”Andrew in Drag” bumbles through lines like “The moment he walked on the stage, my tail began to wag / Wag like a little wiener dog for Andrew in drag,” only to be followed by series of similar jokes delivered in the same style and phrasing. This repetitiveness makes even these short two-minute songs feel tedious by their end.
The vocals are so choppy and repetitive that they ruin whatever fun exists in the instrumentation. Dull lines like “Let Laramie / take care o’ me / till they bury me” predominate. While earlier lyrics were full of intricate wordplay and ambitious poetic storytelling—“Home was anywhere with diesel gas / Love was a trucker’s hand,” Merritt sang in 1999’s “Papa Was a Rodeo,”—these new lyrics are comparatively trite and lazy.
“Love at the Bottom of the Sea” reaches a high point on “Horrible Party.” The song paints a picture of a wonderfully absurd night and is complete with whirling instrumentation and a swaggering, circuitous rhythm. The track’s repetitiveness and crazed energy heighten the sense of being trapped in an evil circus party. It is this circus-like energy that the Magnetic Fields should attempt to capture—they are best when they are outlandish, zany, and chaotic. In “Love at the Bottom of the Sea,” however, they miss their mark, playing clowns who try to entertain with nothing but cheap lyrical tricks.

“You feel, when you play, like all the sounds are just passing through you. We’re equal afterwards. It’s this infinite music going past, and we’re trying to catch onto it,” said Aquiles Navarro, a trumpet player and a student at the New England Conservatory, as he held up two fingers like he was snatching something from the air. Navarro and 22 other NEC students had just performed a “Conduction”—a form of structured improvisation created by conductor and composer Lawrence D. “Butch” Morris—under Morris’ direction at the Institute of Contemporary Art last Friday.
The concert began with the musicians in a semicircle around Morris—the two violins closest to him, a guitar player on each side, and a xylophone-like vibraphone and a few drums towards the back. They had worked with Morris for three days in an intensive workshop during which he taught them the Conduction lexicon, a set of hand and baton gestures he has devised to direct music. The musicians learned how to interpret each of his signals—not as directions on exactly what to play, for no particular notes are ever specified, but simply as signals on when to play and how to move within the dynamic structure of the music. On the small, lit stage in the ICA, the musicians were all at the edges of their seats, rapt as Morris used his baton and body to speak to them.
That performance was the only night when this Conduction’s particular iteration—the contingent collision of sound in space—would ever be heard or made. This finitude seems important because the specificity of time and place could play a part in each of Morris’ creations. Speaking about the effect of circumstance in music, he said, “I think that even when you walk out the door you’re borrowing from the space around you. I don’t deal in chance and uncertainty. I deal in risk.”
Morris began the first piece with his hands at his sides, beckoning slightly as if to call forth a dark sense of motion. The notes came both urgently and evenly. The vibraphone player held two mallets pronged in each hand, gently flicking the bars. The musicians all, for a moment, moved to this beat in a sustained, fluttering pulse. Morris became stiller, and no single sound dominated. With his back to the audience, he seemed to be supervising the assembly of something vast and strange. Someone sitting in the front row began to rock his head back and forth like a metronome.
Morris stepped back, moving his hands gently at his sides, giving the musicians space to draw the sound out. The music was almost loud. In the moment before he broke the sound, he stood in front of the ensemble like he was on the edge of a precipice. The sound trembled in front of him, and for a good five seconds it was as if he would not dare step forward.
Morris conducted with energetic and fluid motions—a flick of his arm darting forward, calling on the guitar to repeat itself; the “that’s life” gesture he sometimes made in the middle of a sustained sound, raising both palms and parting them, then letting them fall. For Morris, each unique concert space differently influences his conducting.
“It’s about the rules of space,” Morris said. “It’s like, in New York, you run the red light. Everyone does. In L.A., you don’t do that. No one in here has ever run a red light in Los Angeles. It’s strange that that’s what happens."
As the piece continued, Morris reached quickly forward, darting back into the musicians’ sustained sound. He swept his baton across as if leveling a surface, and each instrument sounded for just one second as the baton passed it. After a pause, Morris moved forward again, and out of the cacophony the piano leaned into a beat.
Morris conducted for a little over an hour. In the pieces, he continually reshaped the musicians’ combined sound, each new assembly and destruction erased by the next.
For musicians like guitarist Andrew Clinkman, the constant renewals in Morris’ pieces represent a new way of thinking about musical structure. “The way that I deal with time and space as a performer is very different than the way I deal with it as an improviser. [As a performer,] the way I move into time and space is linear. Time and space are a line,” Clinkman said. “Here, you can at each moment cancel what was done before. Every moment is itself a thing and a potential.” In a sense, Morris’ concerts are doubly unique: the audience not only witnesses a new format for improvised music but also experiences the movements and decisions of musicians who themselves feel like they are treading new ground.

Icelandic culture descended upon unsuspecting Bostonians for four days this past weekend. The Icelanders came for Boston’s 3rd annual A Taste of Iceland, a festival hosted by Iceland Naturally, a council of Icelandic brands. They brought with them their cuisine, music, films, and a raffle to win two tickets to Iceland on Icelandair.
The festival featured a special Icelandic menu at Eastern Standard Kitchen & Drinks from Thursday to Sunday as well as a series of free events over the weekend. The schedule for Saturday included ice skating at the Kendall Square Community Ice Skating rink, and at night 88.9 WERS FM presented a concert called Reykjavik Calling at the Paradise Rock Club that brought together Boston-based and Icelandic artists like Mugison, Dave Munro of Air Traffic Controller, and Eli “Paperboy” Reed.
The events concluded Sunday with film screenings at the Kendall Square Cinema. The Roving Reporter ventured around the festival to experience this eclectic combination of cultures.
Sarah Witt, employee at the Kendall Square Community Ice Skating rink
RR: What do you know about Iceland?
SW: I lived there for three months about five years ago. I worked on a sheep farm. You can hitchhike anywhere around the country, and it’s safe, which I did. This family took me in on their sheep farm/hotel where they do the bird-watching tours where the puffins come to the westernmost tip. I just love the country; I think the people are really reserved, and they’re very warm and friendly.
RR: What do you think of Icelandic cuisine?
SW: It’s horrible. I ate whale meat while I was there. In general there aren’t very many fresh fruits and vegetables. Their strawberries were okay, but other than that, it was horrible. I think I lost, like, 20 pounds. But they have good lamb meat.
Matthew Audette, chef at Eastern Standard Kitchen & Drinks
RR: You’ve prepared a special Icelandic menu with Icelandic chef Hákon Már Örvarsson—what makes Icelandic cuisine unique?
MA: The freshness, and how local all of the ingredients are to Iceland. Hákon Már Örvarsson brought all of his own ingredients with him…. He brought a lot of dried herbs, fresh herbs, blueberries, and this product called skyr, which is similar to Greek yogurt. That was something we talked a lot about…how we get the produce we work with. We both work a lot with local farms.
RR: What is your favorite item on the menu you prepared?
MA: He’s doing this lightly smoked Icelandic Arctic char, and it’s rolled in plastic wrap, lightly cooked, and then smoked on the way to the table.
RR: On the menu, you combine lamb and dried blueberries. What’s that like?
MA: The lamb is marinated, and then blueberries are sprinkled almost like a finishing salt. The blueberries have almost a coffee aspect to them, which has to do with the bitterness.
RR: Sounds delicious. Have you ever been to Iceland?
MA: I have never been to Iceland, but after speaking a lot with Hákon Már Örvarsson, it’s definitely a place I want to go.
Suzie Cheatham, concertgoer at Reykjavik Calling
RR: How did you find out about the Icelandic festival?
SC: My cousin sent me an email because my daughter lives in Iceland.
RR: Have you ever been to Iceland?
SC: Yes, about five times. I like that it is a very basic life—there are a lot of things that we think we have to have that they don’t have. Stark countryside, but it’s really gorgeous.
Judy Jun and Brendan Mattox, concertgoers
RR: How did you find out about this festival?
JJ: We are part of [88.9] WERS [FM], actually. I’m a writer for the show.
RR: What was your favorite band that performed tonight?
BM: I really like Sóley [Stefánsdóttir]. I think soon we’re going to hear from Mugison, so pay attention to that one.
RR: Have you ever visited Iceland?
BM: It’s really cold. Volcanoes, hot springs—and one of the artists told me that Reykjavik is the only city heated entirely from underground hot springs.
JJ: I love Iceland, and I’ve always wanted to go there. I was talking to one of the artists, and he says the three things Icelanders are proud of are their music, nature, and bad humor.

Composer Alvin Curran has created pieces for musicians in boats spread across a lake. He has written compositions that incorporate wolf calls, conch shells, foghorns, and church bells, and has now been making experimental music for about 50 years.
Curran co-founded the avant-garde group Musica Elettronica Viva in Rome in 1966. He has created over 150 compositions and sound installations, and his pieces incorporate everything from synthesizers and taped natural sounds to rock and classical instrumentation. He was born in Providence, R.I., and attended Brown University, then studied under composer Elliott C. Carter, Jr. '30 at the Yale School of Music. Curran now teaches privately in Rome and continues to conceive new pieces. Last Tuesday, he shared the theories behind his experimental pieces as the Music Department’s Louis C. Elson Lecturer.
The Harvard Crimson: How is it different to make music now then it was when you were with Musica Elettronica Viva in the ’60s?
Alvin Curran: The Musica Elettronica Viva group really grew organically, in every sense of the word…. In [that] climate of imagined revolution, as it were, the MEV group was a direct reflection of [those] times, of literally creating a start-point zero, trying to imagine a world growing out of a freshly plowed field...where the war machinery, the economic arrogance and overbearing power of capitalism in general would simply cede to a more equitable way of life…. Groups were popping up—theatre groups, dance groups, music groups—and the theme of the day was spontaneity, improvisation, [to] just do anything in the instant..... I don’t think there has been anything similar, on this worldwide scale, of social and political imagination.
THC: And today? In the digital age, how do you see your music as different from that of DJs and performance artists?
AC: Well, for one, I work with some of these people. So, in order not to get too old too quickly, I really embrace a lot of the new developments, and I’ve worked with a bunch of these young guys...these, basically, turntablists.  They’re coming from the pop world, but they speak the historical avant-garde language: the language of sound, the language of madness, nuts, craziness. Like myself [laughs].
THC: Your lecture tonight is called “The New Common Practice, or, A Life in Unpopular Music.” Is that how you see your life so far?
AC: There’s a lot of irony there. I’ll also explain very clearly tonight that I’ve made a career [making experimental art] and others have too. There are not a lot of us…that is, people who do things when they don’t necessarily know what the outcome is. It’s a risk-taking business. If you go into portrait painting, you know what you’re getting yourself into—you paint a portrait, you frame it, you get a check…. [But] there is a thriving musical and artistic life going on which is not necessarily known by a lot of people. And not only is it not known, but it’s distinctly uninterested in those kinds of behaviors which lead to topping the charts or “making it”…. This kind of thing is what I call making unpopular music because it simply defies the laws of economics and good behavior, basically…. This has been part of the classical avant-garde [movements throughout history].
THC: In some ways, it seems like you see your music as a continuation of those classical avant-garde traditions?
AC: I feel very grounded in classical music…[but] I do make a music which is an extreme development of music in the classical tradition…. I’m part of that tradition. I’m just in some land of the weirdos—but I’m not even that, because I make very conventional music. A lot of my music is written for piano, violins, normal instruments, chamber music, string quartets, and so on. It’s not that unusual. But there is one piece of mine which lasts for six hours; that’s unusual. So things like that—other gestures, other ways of thinking about time and space and place—those things are definitely extensions of the classical experiences.
THC: What are you hoping to leave your audience with tonight?
AC: I’m talking about a very special subject…. [It is] a kind of musical theory, if you want to call it that. It’s called “The New Common Practice,” and “The New Common Practice” simply means…making music without rules, without codes, without authority, without any knowledge of what the outcome may be. This is a practice which is actually beginning to happen all around the world right now, simply because, musically speaking, the study and practice of music has come to a point in our time where, in fact, everything is possible. It’s as simple as that. Everything you think, musically, is possible.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three summers ago, I had the opportunity to stay in Munich for a few days. Excited by the prospect of being in a city with such a rich musical tradition, I made sure to see the Munich Philharmonic’s concert, which was held in the Philharmonie hall in the Gasteig cultural center. The Munich Philharmonic is undoubtedly one of the most accomplished orchestras worldwide, and since its founding in 1893, it has been led by illustrious conductors Rudolf Kempe and Sergiu Celibidache. The orchestra’s performance of Mahler’s fifth symphony met my high expectations, but I remember being disappointed by the Philharmonie’s acoustics, even as a young and rather inexperienced classical music aficionado.
This discrepancy was puzzling. One would think that one of the best orchestras in the world would have a home venue fit for its skill and that a hall built in the 1980s would have been designed with the scientific tools necessary to ensure that it would, at the very least, match the sound of older concert halls around the world. Instead, the Philharmonie is notorious for its subpar acoustics. Shortly after its opening in 1985, Leonard Bernstein suggested that Munich “burn it.”
Designing a concert hall with the best conditions for classical music remains as opaque as ever—and perhaps advances in modern science have even mystified further the necessary conditions for good acoustics.
TEARING IT DOWN
Since Bernstein’s harsh advice, others have also critiqued the acoustics of the hall; Italian conductor Riccardo Muti refuses to perform there. “There are seats behind the orchestra, and it’s pretty acoustically terrible,” says Eric J. Heller, chemistry and physics professor who taught Science of the Physical Universe 13: “The Physics of Music and Sound” last fall. “I heard the city of Munich is thinking of tearing it down.”
In building the Philharmonie, the city had to consider factors aside from the music itself, and the hall’s acoustics ultimately paid the price. For a cultural center like Munich, it was important to have a space that would look  impressive. “If a city builds a concert hall…they’re going to go for something fancy,” Heller says. “It’s a gorgeous space.” The expansive wooden walls and panels and the hall’s fan-like shape make it easy on the eyes, but they also contribute to its poor resonance. The wooden walls and panels are actually apt for concert spaces, since wood ensures that sound will bound off surfaces rather than get absorbed. However, the shape of the hall requires sound to travel further to reach a surface, so much of it dissolves before it can bounce back to create a reverberation effect.
Unforeseen logistical problems plague the hall as well. “The part that was supposed to be the opera house became the concert hall,” says Federico Cortese, music director of the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra. “They switched the large space [to house the Munich Philharmonic], and that screwed up the acoustics. The place is famous as a concert hall, but a rather unfortunate place to perform.” Though the intended opera house was more appropriate for the Philharmonic’s size, it was acoustically unfit for classical music performance.
ECHO CHAMBER 
Even good performance spaces are borne from negotiations between conflicting needs, and Harvard’s Paine Hall was no exception. Before its recent renovation, which took over a year, Paine Hall had acoustic problems of its own. The Fanny Peabody Mason Music Building, which houses Paine Hall, had retained its original ventilation system from 1914. “It was configured with a huge fan in the basement that inflated the whole building like a big balloon,” says Robert E. Olson Jr. ’70, the architect who spearheaded the renovation project. “The ductwork that carried the air through the building would carry sound up and down as it distributed through the building. That was the state of the art in 1915…. But you would hear steam and banging [in the music hall] and you would hear the practice rooms and the custodian’s office in the basement on the second floor.” The music department had to close access to practice rooms when there was a concert in Paine Concert Hall because the sound could be heard through the vents.
Though the old ventilation system has recently been renovated, the compromise in acoustics that was made in the building’s construction in 1914—based on the different needs for a speaker and for an orchestra—remains. “For a concert hall, you want something called a reverberation time, which is the time it takes for sound produced on stage to decrease in its intensity by a factor of a million,” says Heller. “You want that to be about 2.1 seconds or so, but that’s terrible for speech. It’s too much echoing. It makes speech way too difficult to understand. You’d want [the reverberation time] to be a little over one second in a speaking hall.” Given Paine Hall’s dual purpose, its reverberation time falls in between the ideal lengths for a lecture space and concert hall.
The renovations to the building’s ventilation system were extensive yet Paine Hall’s physical appearance was untouched: It was a conscious decision to keep the acoustics of the hall the way it was. “The acoustics are good. They are as good as they can be given the hall’s size and shape,” says Anne C. Shreffler, interim chair of the Department of Music.  “It’s a multipurpose hall for lectures and performances, so it was not designed to be the perfect hall.”
Though Paine’s versatility limits its potential to be a perfect venue for a single purpose, the ability of a multi-purpose space to possess great acoustics is evident in Sanders Theatre’s success. “First and foremost, Sanders is a classroom until mid-afternoon,” wrote Ruth Polleys, program manager of Memorial Hall and Lowell Hall, in an email. “This was indeed the original plan for the space. I don’t think [Sanders Theatre] was built as a concert hall. It happens to be a wonderful hall, with wonderful acoustics...but Sanders is also perfectly designed for speaking,” says Cortese. The hall was designed as an academic theater but its acoustics came out impeccable, which enables it to be used for perfomances. The mystery behind Sanders’ sound led Wallace C. Sabine, who founded the field of architectural acoustics during his time as a Harvard professor of physics, to use the space to conduct experiments that would eventually lead him to discover the formula for reverberation time.
FINE-TUNED 
Though the music department has been committed to balancing the two functions of Paine Hall, in 1990 the music department made a decision that privileged its concert hall function over its lecture space function. The seating in Paine Hall was to be replaced, and there was an extensive debate on whether or not to add wooden pullout desks so that students could take notes on a hard surface during lectures. “I’m very pleased that they chose not to do this in 1990.... It would have added a lot of hard, reflective surfaces, which would [have] drastically changed the acoustics,” says Nancy B. Shafman, director of administration for the Music department.
Even without the addition of the desks, the replaced upholstery on the seats noticeably changed the character of the hall’s acoustics. “Sound gets absorbed by material. We put pads on the back of the seats, so that even if the seat was empty we would get a similar absorption affect as if a person was sitting there,” says Olson. The type and amount of upholstery affects the acoustic differences musicians will feel between a rehearsal—when all the seats are empty—and a concert. Without this provision, the presence of an audience would affect not only the ambiance of a performance but also its actual sound.
While there are larger elements that impact the acoustics of a space, like its shape, even smaller, seemingly insignificant details as these can change the hall in unpredictable and substantial ways. Even the type of paint that is used on the walls has an effect. Boston’s Symphony Hall—widely regarded as one of the most acoustically fine concert halls in the world—owes some of its success to the smallest details in its aesthetic composition. There are statues embedded in the upper walls, and the railings on the balconies have intricate designs on it. “A small fig leaf that bulges from the wall helps segment high frequency sound,” says Heller. “A statue that’s about six feet tall is helping to scatter the lower-frequency sound. You want sound to be randomized in its direction after a couple of bounces of the walls and ceilings.”
OUT WITH THE NEW 
Given the fact that the smallest detail can affect the acoustics of a space, the construction of a concert hall is still risky. Despite advances in the science of sound, acoustic architects still cannot fully account for every such detail in the design of a concert hall. Sound waves are chaotic. “We have computer programs that can actually check out the designs,” says Heller. “But it turns out that it is too much work for even the most powerful computers to follow every single wave of sound.”
Older concert halls, designed with anecdotal principles and evidence in  mind, tend to have better acoustics than modern halls. “The concert halls that were built in the early 19th and 20th century are to this day the most beautiful and acoustically perfect halls,” Shreffler says. “People go to these old halls and try to figure it out. Acousticians study them: What makes it so perfect? Why are there no bad seats? Is it the material? The shape? And certain things are known, but they have derived principles from studying these old halls.”
Though the Paine Hall renovations may have been a chance to update the acoustics of the space using modern science, the department, aware of this history, chose not to. “When you start fiddling with acoustics, there’s always the danger of making them worse,” says Shreffler. The science is frustratingly imprecise.
Thus, results of incorporating such science into the process of designing concert halls have been mixed at best. “In the 20th century, it became much more complex,” says Cortese. “From just a matter of tradition, it became a matter of intellectual knowledge to create the right reverberations with buildings that were more sophisticated but not necessarily following the old rules for the orchestra.” Though some concert halls built with the help of science in the late 20th century have been immensely successful—like the Berliner Philharmonie, constructed in the ’60s—there is still much to be learned from the existing tradition of acoustics.
MATCHMAKING
Concert hall architects must also contend with the fact that different types of classical music are best heard in different acoustic circumstances. Earlier classical music generally demands crisp sounds, which means that a hall with a lot of reverberation would not be a good place for such a performance. “[Boston’s] Symphony Hall has beautiful acoustics,” says Lidiya Yankovskaya, a professional conductor. “I think the acoustics are reflective of when it was built. It is most suited to Beethoven or early Romantic music. But I did Bach’s St. John Passion last year, and I was singing in the chorus. We were working so hard to make all the articulations super clear. But one rehearsal I sat out and listened, and it had turned into mush because the space is so lush.”
Yankovskaya is also the current musical director of the Lowell House Opera. The production must annually overcome the challenges of performing in a dining hall. Ironically, though this space was built with no intention of being used as an opera hall, it is markedly successful.  “The acoustics work,” Yankovskaya says. “For the stage, we build a large set of platforms so that it is not a dining hall anymore by the time that everyone is done with it.”
As Lowell House Opera has to work with its traditional venue despite its potential flaws, other musicians and artistic programmers around Cambridge and Boston must strike a balance between acoustics and logistical factors when choosing a performance space. The Celebrity Series of Boston books around 40 performances per season. The selection of venue depends on practical concerns like expected audience size and availability of the space, but the organization must also accommodate the needs of the artists. “It’s sort of a chess game of trying to find the right thing for the artist and the hall,” says Stephanie Janes, the publicity and communications manager of the series.While New England Conservatory’s Jordan Hall is widely regarded as the best hall in Boston for chamber music, pianist Lang Lang was presented in Symphony Hall because the demand for tickets was so high. The Emerson String Quartet, though, will be performing in Jordan Hall on April 27. “The Emerson String Quartet has performed in Jordan Hall before, and they really like the acoustics there,” Janes says.
REMASTERED SOUND
Part of what makes acoustics so important to musicians and enthusiasts is that it affects the caliber of the performance itself. “We had to play for hundreds of reasons in bad venues, and the musicians did not enjoy that,” says Cortese. “Everyone is happier when people can hear each other. It affects the mood, because you don’t have to work as hard.” Not only do good acoustics contribute to how well an orchestra can play together, but it also ensures that the musicians feel more confident—which makes for a better classical music experience.
The perfect concert space can also recreate the sound that the composer intended. According to Cortese, Verdi’s operas are best heard in 18th-century theater in Italy, since those are the halls that Verdi wrote for. “Every time you do an opera in the United States, the proportions [between sections] are off. As soon as you perform in an old theater, you have it right away.” The right acoustics brings musicians and listeners closer to the old masters’ visions.

“If a bomb went off in this room at this moment, the cause of Strindberg would be set back a century,” one monocle-clad audience member observed as a crowd of scholars shuffled into the Barker Center’s Thompson Room on Friday afternoon. The group, a collection of translators, directors, professors, and filmmakers, had gathered for the Harvard Strindberg Symposium. To distinguish it from similar academic events, the symposium was filled with both critical and performative reinterpretations designed to show its enduring depth and broad relevance of Strindberg’s work. “Modern theater would not have existed without him. That’s a fact,” said Ursula A.L. Lindqvist, preceptor for Scandinavian languages and director of Undergraduate Studies for Scandinavian.
August Strindberg, as Lindqvist explained during the first lecture, was a Swedish writer whose enormous body of work has always had a complicated critical reputation. He is usually thought of as a misogynist, and his attitude towards women has became so infamous that Woody Allen has quipped about it in his 1979 film “Manhattan.” Lindqvist, however, believes that focusing on this specific reading of his character is unfair. “It’s not desirable or responsible to label Strindberg a misogynist,” she said. “It is undeniable that today Strindberg remains one of the great modernists.”
These underappreciated strains were addressed in lectures given by Harvard Professor Martin Puchner and University of Illinois Professor Anna Westerståhl Stenport. Puchner, who discussed the 1903 play “Hellas,” identified the Swede as a modern champion of the philosophical drama that originated with Plato’s Socratic dialogues.
Stenport’s speech, which focused on the 1901 play “Dance of Death,” was a more explicit attempt to move away from the criticism that has colored Strindberg’s work; as she noted, the somewhat reductive interpretations that emerged upon the work’s premiere have persisted to this day. “The marriage drama plot, the religious conversion plot—it’s there, but there’s so much more,”  Stenport said. Her speech examined how the play’s harsh social critique, layed out in a highly expressionistic manner, has not been examined in traditional studies of the work. By examining historical evidence, she was able to convincingly claim that the play’s unorthodox set design was meant to evoke late 19th century prisons.
Such critical reevaluations were augmented by one of the most distinctive elements of the symposium: the inclusion of staged readings of Strindberg’s work. Excerpts from ”Hellas” and “Dance of Death” preceded Puchner’s and Stenport’s lectures and gave their claims context. Lindqvist feels that these performances were an integral part of the symposium. “We’re actually showcasing the creative work, which is the reason we’re all here,” says Lindqvist. “What better way to understand Strindberg than to come in contact with his work directly?”
These performances served another purpose; as David R. Grieder ’14, who helped publicize the event, explained, they are one of several elements in the symposium designed to appeal to undergraduates. For Lindqvist, getting students excited was a major goal of the event. While researching previous Strindberg events at Harvard, she discovered that in the middle of the 20th century students used to frequently stage his plays at venues such as the Loeb Ex. Since then, however, that interest has been lost. “Since the 1960s, he has definitely not been at the forefront of student consciousness. We need to reintroduce Strindberg,” Lindqvist said.
Ture Rangström, artistic director at the Intima Teatern in Stockholm, Sweden, feels that Strindberg is growing in popularity among the youth because of his modernist aesthetic. “Young directors want to do Strindberg because they feel he is more free, more experimental,” he says. Strindberg’s work was explored by radical reinterpretations of his plays, as well as more conventionally staged scenes. Filmmaker and choreographer Gabrielle Lansner, for instance, showed her short film “The Stronger,” which explores Strindberg’s eponymous 1889 play through the medium of dance. Other interpretations were discussed by scholar Victor Grovas, who spoke about Mexican stagings of Strindberg, including versions done by the cult filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky.
What was most compelling about Grovas’s speech was how it displayed the universal appeal of Strindberg’s work, despite his tarnished critical reputation. These sentiments were shared by Grieder. “The longer I worked on it, the more I realized its magnitude,” he says.  “People are going wild in Sweden right now for the centennial of his death.” Details such as this abounded at the symposium, and showcased a desire to revive popular interest in Strindberg. “If you make a symposium like this, this is how it starts,” Rangström said, smiling.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past January, President Obama stated that the state of our union is and always will be strong. With an improving yet still ailing economy and bleak budget outlooks for the future, some may disagree. What nearly every American and politician agrees upon, however, is that the state of our politics is weak. The strong reaction to the miraculous recovery of Representative Gabrielle D. Giffords showed, if anything, that most Americans and members of Congress wish that the government could work better for its people. Despite the good intentions of many individuals—from the Bowles-Simpson Commission to the Senate Gang of Six—politics in America remains unnecessarily polarized. If gridlock remains despite the willingness of significant party members and committee leaders to work together, perhaps we as Americans have been looking for the problem in all of the wrong places. Polarization in America is not a result of disagreements over solutions; it is a serious dispute over what the problems actually are.
If Americans remember one thing about their government from the summer, it is the fierce and drawn-out debate over the debt ceiling and fiscal future of the United States. Approximately six months later however, the president seems to have forgotten. He’s been fighting against Congress for six months, but he won’t even mention what they were fighting about. In the State of the Union address, the big three entitlement programs—Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security—received one mention in a speech that lasted well over one hour, despite the fact that they are the largest drivers of the federal debt by a wide margin. In the Republican response, it took Governor Mitch E. Daniels (R-IN) a mere few minutes to point out the glaring omission: “So 2012 is a year of true opportunity, maybe our last, to restore an America of hope and upward mobility, and greater equality. The challenges aren’t matters of ideology, or party preference; the problems are simply mathematical, and the answers are purely practical.”
On the issue of entitlement reform and truly placing the nation on a path to fiscal sustainability, Republicans have kept their word. Last April, Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-WI) introduced a plan to reduce the federal deficit by $6.2 trillion over the next ten years and reform welfare and entitlement programs to bring future spending under control and preserve the programs for the future. In response, Democrats accused Ryan of throwing grandma off the cliff and gleefully used the plan to pummel Republicans in a special congressional election in New York. Ryan tried again, this time introducing a bipartisan Medicare reform plan with Senator Ron L. Wyden (D-OR) that offered both more choices for seniors and means testing programs, which determine eligibility based on each recipient’s wealth. The White House, Democratic leaders, and liberal advocacy groups once again flatly rejected the proposal. When Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) introduced a plan to reform Social Security that would prevent drastic cuts as it depletes its funds over the next 20 years, Democrats and Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-NV) refused to consider it.
After two Republican proposals and at least one bipartisan proposal, Democrats have yet to put forward even one solution to the entitlement crisis that currently threatens to engulf the nation. Rep. Nancy P. D. Pelosi has vowed to fight against any attempt to cut Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Sen. Reid called Social Security “the most successful social program in the history of the world,” yet he proposed nothing to save it. President Obama has done little but attack Republicans for even touching the programs. Under the president’s 2013 budget plan, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the economy will completely shut down in 2027 because of the sheer size of the debt. The Democratic Party has essentially announced that its policy is to deny reality. Medicare will be bankrupt in less than nine years. The economy will collapse in 15 years, and, if we somehow survive Obama’s budget projections, Social Security will cut all benefits by nearly 25 percent in 20 years if nothing is done. Currently, the entitlement programs have promised $46 trillion in benefits that they cannot pay for, and the figure worsens every year that nothing is done. If Democrats want to pay for these with increased taxes on the 1 percent, they better hope that the wealthy get a lot richer, and quickly. For every year that the status quo remains, the situation worsens, and the possible solutions shrink in number.
By refusing to recognize the true financial state of the union, Democrats have created the paralyzing partisanship that they so frequently complain about. Republicans have come forward with solutions for the American people and have displayed willingness to compromise, but compromise assumes that the opposite side has a position with which one can compromise. Democrats not only lack solutions, but they also willingly remain ignorant of perhaps the greatest threat to the future of the nation for their own temporary political gain. Ending polarization doesn’t require any complicated reforms; all it requires is for one side to open its eyes to reality and come forward with its own solutions. The adults in the room are waiting.

On March 4, President Obama warned thousands of members of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee that excessive talk of war would only benefit Iran and hurt Israel and America. However, he assured AIPAC that he would take a strong stance against Iran, even resorting to military action as a last resort. Obama is right to take a firm but even-handed stance against Iran, a country which has consistently destabilized regional peace. However, Iran does not pose a legitimate threat to Israel, a country with the military might to handle a hypothetical Iranian attack without the help of the U.S. The growing sound of drumbeats on Capitol Hill over Iran is a symptom of the influence of the Israel lobby rather than the demands of the situation at hand, and the U.S. should avoid getting involved in a potential war with Iran at all costs.
Iran’s bark is surely louder than its bite. For one, the country has failed to prove itself militarily. Its apparent assassination attempts on Israeli agents failed catastrophically, with every participant in the affair apprehended before a single Israeli was harmed. Furthermore, although it may not be immediately apparent, sanctions on Iran have been effective. The Iranian rial has plummeted, losing half its value since December 2011, the same month that President Ahmadinejad admitted to Iran’s parliament that the country was segregated from the international banking system. Rising food and gasoline prices have been a problem since early 2010, when the Iranian government cut food and gasoline subsidies substantially due to economic difficulties.  The recent sanctions enacted by America and the European Union in light of the International Atomic Energy Agency’s troubling report, which are estimated to cut Iran’s oil exports—themselves accounting for an estimated 65 percentof the Iranian government’s revenues—by 60 percent. These economic difficulties are being felt by Iran’s general public: 65 percent of Iranians worried about the current sanctions affecting their lives a “great deal” or “somewhat.” Iran’s inflation also remains high at 21 percent. Clearly Iran is in no military or economic position to attack Israel. Allowing war rhetoric to dominate diplomatic strategy in the Middle East will only drive the Iranian people to favor their government even more in the face of foreign adversity and increase the likelihood of an Iranian pre-emptive strike.
On the other hand, Israel has demonstrated its military might countless times since its inception, crushing opposition in the Gaza Strip, West Bank, and Lebanon in the past decade alone. Not only does this demonstrate Israel’s obvious resilience against a weaker opponent, it also raises another question: Is Iran the only country in the Middle East whose belligerent militarism should be worrying the United   States right now? Although Iran is belligerent and weak, Israel is belligerent and terrifyingly strong.
But if the threat of Iran is indeed so minimal and Israel is more than capable of handling the situation, where is all this war talk coming from in the U.S.? The Israel lobby has maintained a prominent presence in Washington  D.C., with lobbying groups such as the aforementioned AIPAC responsible for providing significant funding to the campaigns of countless congressmen, governors, and even presidents. The addition or subtraction of support from this powerful lobby can literally mean the birth or death of a political career. A number of powerful members of the Israel lobby have come out wholeheartedly in favor of U.S. intervention in the situation. It comes with no surprise that Mitt Romney, who has also been invited to speak at AIPAC conference, has stated “If Barack Obama gets re-elected, Iran will have a nuclear weapon, and the world will change if that’s the case.” Republican candidates Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich have also been invited to speak at the conference. The pressure for the U.S. to intervene in an issue in which it has very little, if any, involvement stems almost solely from political pressures rather than from U.S. interests in the conflict. Surely we should pay more attention to the situation at hand rather than the war mongering of lobbying groups.
Iran poses little threat to Israel and it is highly unlikely that its nuclear program will turn into a full-fledged attack against Israel. Israel is more than capable to launch a pre-emptive attack and does not need America’s help should it decide to do so. Ultimately, the U.S. should resist the influence of the Israel lobby and try to stay out of this sticky situation. If anything, there are more pressing matters in the Middle East than the overhyped tensions between Israel and Iran.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A recent wildly popular Crimson news article on alternative sexualities at Harvard—deemed “The Kinkiest Student Newspaper Article Ever” by one blog—belies the fact that frank and open conversations about sex and sexuality do not, in fact, occur very often on Harvard’s campus. Sex is a topic so ubiquitous and so integral to our social worlds that the dearth of open discourse on sexuality at our otherwise intellectually vibrant university can be downright baffling. Fortunately, “munch,” an informal collective of Harvard students interested in kinky sex, and Harvard’s inaugural Sex Week, scheduled for March 25-31, promises to reverse that trend and arouse a much-needed dialogue on sex and sexuality on our campus.
Munch, a budding student organization, marks the first time in recent memory that a Harvard student group has been founded to provide a safe and accepting environment for students with sexual interests outside of the mainstream. Founded just last semester, munch has already successfully reached out to students with unconventional sexual preferences and has begun to fill its role as a supportive space for students who have felt alone amid Harvard’s patently silent sexual culture. Facilitating open dialogue on sexuality is essential in de-stigmatizing unconventional interests and practices, and munch has certainly done just that. Munch’s efforts to lift the stigma from kinky sex are particularly laudable on a campus so frequently divisive as our own. In this spirit, we unequivocally support munch in its effort to become an officially recognized student organization.
Along with munch, Harvard’s first annual Sex Week represents what we hope will become a permanent campus trend. Frank and objective conversation on sexuality is fundamental not only to accepting students with alternative sexual preferences, but also to promoting healthy sexuality among all students. The importance of talking about sex cannot be overstated, particularly on a college campus, where many experience independence and explore their sexuality for the first time. Students who are aware of issues surrounding sex like the availability of contraception and other forms of protection, the tremendous variation in sexual preferences, and the dangers of sexual violence, are far more likely to access their sexuality in a healthy way and be honest with themselves and their partners about their desires.
Sexual literacy can also play a role in diminishing the frequency of sexual violence. A United States Department of Justice report states that “sexual assault is widely considered to be the most underreported violent crime in America,” and a dialogue on healthy sexuality has the potential to empower victims to report sexual assault and lift the stigma from reporting sex crimes.  Additionally, students who are aware of what does and does not constitute acceptable sexual behavior will become students who intervene when their peers exhibit sexual aggression and citizens who reject the victim-blaming rhetoric that so often allows sexual assailants to commit crimes with impunity.
Though munch represents the sexual interests of a minority of Harvard students, the spirit that it and Harvard’s upcoming Sex Week embody—one of open and candid conversation about sexuality—is relevant in some capacity to all of us. We encourage students to take part in the conversation that munch and the organizers of Sex Week have begun. Whether we are having it or not, all of us can be talking about sex.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, President Obama called upon Americans to push Congress to end fossil fuel subsidies. This announcement has the potential to be a merely symbolic moment, a simple election-year scheme designed to appease environmentalists and budget hawks. However, it also has the potential to become a powerful victory for our country should we choose to answer our president’s call to action and make his words reality.
From any position on political spectrum, ending fossil fuel subsidies should be a policy to support. Most people would argue that subsidies can be smart investments—assuming that they support industries which work in the public interest through the products they supply or jobs they provide.  However, fossil fuel subsidies are a waste of money. Why should an average American give his or her money to an industry which already makes record profits year after year? Beyond being a senseless fiscal decision, subsidising fossil fuels is dangerous. Every year, 24,000 Americans die because of toxic pollution from fossil fuel powerplants. By subsidizing fossil fuels, we pay to harm our own families. Fossil fuels are also a major contributor to climate change, which has health, agricultural, economic, and ecological consequences around the world. It is outrageous that the federal government wastes around $10 billion each year subsidizing a harmful industry already bloated with profits.
It is particularly frustrating that our government is giving money to already-profitable corporations at a time when there are many other pressing issues crying for financial support. Those billions of dollars given to fossil fuel corporations could be used to help pay off our national debt. They could provide tax relief to struggling American families.  The money could be used to upgrade our public transport systems, like the seriously-troubled MBTA, which would have the additional benefit of reducing dependence on automobiles. Or it could be invested in shovel-ready renewable energy projects which would create thousands of jobs, like Cape Wind or clean-tech infrastructure. There are many productive uses for those billions of dollars—but supporting dangerous energy corporations which already earn record profits is not one of them.
Critics may argue that fossil fuel subsidies are necessary to protect consumers from high gas prices. However, this is false reasoning—oil prices are not a simple issue of supply and demand.  According to the Energy Information Administration, supply is higher than it was three years ago, when gas cost $1.90. An oil boom in North Dakota is expected to push US crude output this year to its highest level since 1999—and yet the price of gas is expected to hit the roof. These rocketing prices come, in fact, from Wall Street trading of gasoline futures contracts, which are basicallly bets on where gas prices are going to be. Elimintating fossil fuel subsidies will not affect the real forces which drive the prices at the pump.
Some may argue that if we eliminate fossil fuel subsidies, we should also cut back on renewable subsidies in the interests of fairness. This is false logic. Firstly, there is a belief that taxpayer money can and should be spent on initiatives that work in the taxpayer’s interest—clean and safe renewable energy is in the public interest and worth taxpayer support through subsidies. Secondly, subsidies on fossil fuels do not serve to level the playing field, so removing them would only help to lessen the distortion. Fossil fuels have the tremendous advantage of externalizing immense costs of production to the public, which makes them appear cheaper than they really are. If fossil fuel corporations actually paid for the healthcare bills and economic losses which result from their pollution, fossil fuel energy would be far more expensive than clean and safe renewable energy. It is also worth noting that fossil fuel subsidies today are far greater than renewable energy subsidies—between 2002 and 2008, the government gave $72 billion to the fossil fuel industry compared to just $29 billion for renewable energy investments.
Now is the time to step up and answer our president’s call to stop supporting a dangerous industry. Do you have two minutes of free time today?  Call your representatives and your senators, and ask them to take action in the next two weeks to remove fossil fuel subsidies from the 2013 budget.
This is our country, and it is our duty to see that our money is spent wisely. We must stand up for a safe, healthy future. Will you make that phone call?

Harvard’s Berkman Center for Internet and Society announced the next phase of its collaboration with Lady Gaga’s new Born This Way Foundation just days after the pop sensation’s much-trumpeted visit to Harvard to launch the organization.
After co-sponsoring a star-studded stage event with the Harvard Graduate School of Education last week, the Berkman Center will return its collaboration with Lady Gaga to more familiar territory—academic research.
On Monday, the Law School center announced the research project, entitled Kinder and Braver World, which it described as an attempt to compile anti-bullying research that will inform the work of the Born This Way Foundation.
The research will touch on subjects such as anti-bullying initiatives and methods of youth empowerment, ranging from government legislation to school curriculums.
“We are continuing to figure out what are the underlying issues associated with youth empowerment and bravery,” said John G. Palfrey ’94, a co-director of the Berkman Center who will serve as co-editor of the Kinder and Braver World project.
The Berkman Center made the first five papers in the series available to the public on its website on Monday.
Palfrey said that these five papers have already informed Lady Gaga’s preparations for launching her foundation. He added that the internet will allow the public to contribute suggestions to further hone the work.
“We can put work out there and improve it pretty much on a continuous basis,” Palfrey said, praising the ease of submitting feedback online.
The new project will unveil more papers on its website in the coming months.
The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation donated $500,000 to the Berkman Center to fund research for the Born This Way Foundation, plus an additional half a million dollars to other facets of the Foundation’s work, according to the Berkman Center’s website.
The website said that Lady Gaga has put $1.2 million into the organization herself.
Palfrey said that the Berkman Center hopes to involve youth directly in its Kinder and Braver World research. Current research underway at the center’s Youth and Media Lab will contribute to the new series, he said.
At the launch event in Sanders Theatre, Lady Gaga said that she wanted her foundation to base its efforts on researching solutions to bullying rather than just doling out funds.
“I really wanted to do this properly.... We are not philanthropists,” Lady Gaga said of herself and her mother.

The Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, which represents many of the workers in the Harvard Library system, released an open letter to the Harvard community Monday morning that raised concerns of understaffing in the Library and the lack of transparency in the ongoing restructuring process.
HUCTW leaders wrote the letter in response to Harvard University Library Executive Director Helen Shenton’s Jan. 19 announcement that the Library would reduce its staff through a voluntary retirement process and possibly layoffs.
The letter, which features testimony from unnamed union and non-union workers, warned that the transition process may fail if it does not involve workers, adding that understaffing and outsourcing already threaten the Library system’s quality.
“The process needs to be transparent and participatory,” stated the letter, which was published in The Crimson on Monday. “If the cautionary cries of library staff about severe understaffing and quality concerns are not heard and heeded, the Harvard Library transition will not be successful.”
Although leaders from HUCTW have previously sent several letters to the union’s membership, this is the union’s first open communication to the larger Harvard community regarding the restructuring.
But despite the open letter’s warning against potential layoffs, its authors emphasized that the letter’s criticism was targeted at ill-conceived plans, not the Library transition itself.
“This isn’t meant to be an anti-transition letter—it’s meant to make the transition work, and the only way it’s going to work is if these concerns are heard and heeded,” said Carrie E. Barbash, a HUCTW Organizer and one of the letter’s authors. “[The workers are] a group who are deeply committed to their work in the libraries. They want the reorganization to be great, too.”
Barbash said union leaders decided to write the letter following the first meeting between HUCTW representatives and Harvard Library officials.
“We just weren’t feeling like we were being heard,” Barbash said. "It just seemed that after that meeting we really wanted to open this up more and broaden the conversation.”
HUCTW leaders have worked on the letter for the past week, Barbash said. In addition to Barbash, the letter’s principal authors were HUCTW director Bill Jaeger and HUCTW organizer Alexandra E. S. Chisholm.
A University spokesperson declined to comment on the open letter but pointed out that Harvard has included Library employees in forum and working group discussions during the past two years of the transition process. The spokesperson added that a series of joint council meetings will be held starting in March so that HUCTW and Library management can negotiate the Library reorganization.
James R. Adler, a cataloging assistant at the Harvard Divinity School, said he appreciated the letter and agreed with many of its points.
“[The letter] walked step-by-step through the reasons this needs to be done more carefully and with more participation,” Adler said.
The effects of understaffing are a daily struggle, Adler said.
“It’s something we feel constantly,” he said. “I don’t even feel like I can go to half of the meetings because of all the work I have to do. We have been stretched so thinly.”
Adler added that he feels the University has not done enough to incorporate employees in this undertaking.
“I feel like we have not been listened to—and the results are showing,” Adler said, referencing the low morale of his coworkers. “If we had been allowed into the process much earlier, I think it would have been a better process.”
Despite these concerns, Adler said that he and other library workers support the University’s creation of a more modern library system.
“There are two visions here,” Adler said. “The library of the 21st century is one vision. Also, there’s the nightmare of layoffs. It’s impossible for the staff to see past the first nightmare and see the vision.”

Harvard Business School convened more than 600 business leaders in New York City on Monday night to discuss U.S. competitiveness in the global economy and propose steps that individual companies can take to strengthen American business.
The event, part of the Business School’s U.S. Competitiveness Project, included opening and concluding remarks by Business School Dean Nitin Nohria and panel discussions featuring HBS faculty members and New York business leaders.
Nohria mentioned in his opening remarks that more Business School alumni live in New York City than any other town in the world.
At the event, professors Michael E. Porter and Jan W. Rivkin presented the results of a recent survey of more than 10,000 Business School alumni meant to assess graduates’ views of America’s ability to compete with other countries. The study was featured in the latest issue of the Harvard Business Review.
“America needs to be and needs to remain a very central part and a very competitive part of the global economy, because the world still depends upon America’s prosperity, as do we here in the United States,” Nohria said.
Speaking to attendees, Porter argued that the decline in U.S. jobs reflects not only a short-term economic downturn but also deeper problems in American life. Ineffective legislators, a complex tax code, and failing elementary and secondary education all weaken U.S. competitiveness, alumni said in response to the survey, though they praised the American university system and the nation’s entrepreneurial spirit.
Porter said business leaders should not just wait for the federal government to fix the problems that the survey participants identified. Instead, he encouraged business leaders to take action by supporting local manufacturers, creating apprentice programs to train U.S. workers, and expanding domestic operations.
“Our real focus in this project is to think also about the role of business,” Porter said. “What’s the role for us? What can we do without the need for government passing legislation?”
In a panel session moderated by Harvard Business Review Editor-in-Chief Adi Ignatius, professors discussed policy recommendations based on their research.
To provide concrete examples of business decisions that fit these academic models, New York business and civic leaders including Citigroup CEO Vikram S. Pandit and IBM executive Stanley S. Litow shared their experiences on a second panel.
“America’s unparalleled ability to pair entrepreneurs with capital creates innovation and growth that benefit people in every corner of the world,” Pandit said in a press release. “That progress is currently stalled but could be reignited through sound policy.”

Women’s Week 2012 kicked off Monday with a launch party and a performance by Expressions Dance Company in front of the Science Center.
Members of The Seneca, Inc., a co-sponsor of Women’s Week, served free candy and cake decorated with the official colors of Women’s Week, purple and yellow.
Before indulging in the festive sweets, students had to fill out a card that read “Women’s Week is...” and change their statuses on Facebook to say they were participating in Harvard’s Women’s Week.
“My news feed was bombarded with statuses about Women’s Week, which made me very happy,” said Seneca President Marianna F. Verlage ’13.
Women’s Week, co-sponsored by The Seneca and Harvard College Women’s Center, aims to celebrate women’s achievements and generate campus conversation about the status of women in today’s society.
Though Monday’s party in front of the Science Center marked the beginning of Women’s Week, the series of events officially began Sunday with the Radcliffe Choral Society’s talk on pursuing passion while searching for a career.
Organizers significantly expanded their publicity campaign this year, according to Women’s Center intern and Women’s Week organizer Nur N. Ibrahim ’13. In the month leading up to Women’s Week, sponsors posted its trademark logo—two yellow W’s with a purple background—across campus. Organizers then took pictures of this guerilla-style advertising and posted those images on Tumblr, according to Ibrahim, who is also a Crimson editor on the photography board.
“That definitely attracted a lot more attention,” Ibrahim said. “A lot more people will come to events this year simply because of things that preceded them.”
The week will culminate on Thursday, Feminist Coming Out Day, with a coffee house and reception for the Feminist Portrait Project. The Portrait Project is an initiative sponsored by the Radcliffe Union of Students that asks self-identified feminists to submit a picture and a statement explaining why they are feminists.
The Feminist Coming Out Day Coffee House has been one of the most popular Women’s Week events in recent years, according to Ibrahim.
During the reception, students will perform music and spoken word poetry related to gender issues.
Co-sponsored by Queer Students and Allies, the event aims to demonstrate the diversity of individuals at Harvard who identify as feminists, RUS co-chair Humbi Song ’13 said.
Other events include a discussion on feminism and hip-hop hosted by the Association of Black Harvard Women and Latinas Unidas as well as a forum at the Institute of Politics on female leadership.
Ibrahim said that Women’s Week events draw significant numbers because these events offer students the opportunity to discuss topics that are not typically broached in such public settings.
“Events like this really attract a huge [portion] of the Harvard population because it’s something that’s not discussed in major Harvard forums,” Ibrahim said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four authors and scholars examined gender roles and stereotypes in children’s and young adult literature at a Women’s Week 2012 event on Monday.
Panelists discussed the history and evolution of gender stereotypes in this genre of literature. They also talked about the ways in which they have attempted to subvert these norms in their own work.
Panelist Jacqueline Davies said that in one of her books she wrote the male protagonist, Evan, as a more emotive character and his sister, Jessie, as more logical.
“The brother’s the one who’s good with people, who understands people, who’s very empathic, so in that case, I actually had my male and female characters play against what people would generally think of as being gender-stereotypical roles,” Davies said in an interview.
Davies said her readers, generally between 8 and 11 years of age, responded positively to this blurring of gender norms.
“I get girls writing to me saying, ‘I love it that Jessie’s so smart,’” Davies said. “I don’t get boys writing to me saying ‘I love it that Evan’s so empathic.’ They never notice that. They just like the characters.”
Her book centers on a competition between the brother and sister, with each vying to sell more lemonade than the other. When Davies visits classrooms and asks students which of the two characters they want to win, girls often voice support for Jessie while boys get behind Evan. Davies attributed the children’s preference for the sibling of the same sex to simple gender bias.
“The boys like the boy, and the girls like the girl,” she said.
Panelist Jeannine Atkins said that Lucy from C. S. Lewis’s “The Chronicles of Narnia” was an example of how gender stereotypes enabled the author to weave greater emotion in his text.
“Lucy is the heart of the books,” said Atkins, a professor of children’s literature at University of Massachusetts, Amherst. “Lucy could cry, and she could have tea with Mr. Tumnus, and she could fall in love with him as a friend.”
The event, which was held in the parlor of the Phillips Brooks House, drew a crowd comprised of 22 women and 1 man.
Women’s Week, which is co-sponsored by the Harvard College Women’s Center and The Seneca, Inc., seeks to foster discussion about women’s current status as well as celebrate women’s history and past achievement. Women’s Week 2012 features a series of events which  will culminate with the Feminist Coming Out Day Coffee House on Thursday evening. Women’s Week will conclude with its final event on Friday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Voters in ten states, including Massachusetts, had their first chance to weigh in today on a Republican primary contest whose outcome has become increasingly less certain since it began in January.
Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney had been considered the party’s most likely nominee, but a series of setbacks and lost primaries have plagued his campaign in the weeks leading up to today’s ten contests, collectively known as Super Tuesday. Former Senator Rick Santorum has posed an increasing threat to what once seemed to be Romney’s inevitable nomination.
Political analysts said this week that they believe Romney is still the likely Republican nominee. His performance today will likely determine the course of the race in coming months, they said.
“There’s nothing definitive on the table except that Romney can get close to closing the deal,” Harvard Kennedy School lecturer M. Marty Linksy said about Super Tuesday.
“He’s got two things going for him. One is the symbolic strategy that would manifest itself if he won Ohio or Tennessee. The other is the numerical strategy if he came away with a lot of delegates,” Linsky said. The day’s results, he added, could allow Romney to numerically run away with the race.
But whatever the outcome, political analysts said they doubt the other Republican candidates will drop out of the race.
“Throughout the country, it will be enough of a mixed bag that every one of the candidates will be able to step up to the podium and in some way, shape, or form say it was a good night,” Republican former songressional candidate Joseph D. Malone ’78 said.
Republican political analysts said the Massachusetts primary does not hold much real significance nationally, as voters are expected to overwhelmingly support their former governor.
Republican consultant Todd Domke said Romney is well positioned to win the state by a landslide.
“It's a coronation of Mitt in his main home state,” Domke wrote in an email. “Romney is expected to win about two-thirds of the vote [...] and all of the delegates. The other candidates didn’t contest him here, so the outcome has never been in question.”
Despite Massachusetts’ lack of strategic importance, Romney will be back in his home state at the Westin Hotel in Boston tonight to make a speech after voting closes nationwide.

By clinching the Ivy League Basketball title this past weekend, Harvard became the fifth school in the Ancient Eight to claim both the basketball and football crowns in the same year. The Back Page took a look in the archives to see how the Crimson’s efforts on the hardwood and gridiron stack up with other school’s accomplishments.
The four schools before Harvard to claim both titles were Yale, Dartmouth, Princeton, and Penn.
The Quakers and Tigers lead the pack in dual championships, with the two schools garnering five seasons each with top honors in both football and basketball.
Though Penn won the basketball Ancient Eight title in six straight seasons (’70-’75), the football team was never able to complete the tandem championships. Two years later, a five-year basketball streak was again let down by a football drought. And in both cases, the year the basketball team’s streak ended, football finally managed to take the helm of the Ancient Eight.
The Bulldogs have not accomplished the feat since the first Ivy League season in 1956.
Columbia has only won a single title in each sport since the inception of the Ivy League, and both of those came before 1970. Brown now joins the Lions as the only other school that can boast a solitary title in basketball.
Cornell has only combined for seven titles between basketball and football, but has dominated other men’s sports. The Big Red has won (out of 56 seasons) 32 wrestling championships, 26 lacrosse championships, and currently ranks behind the Crimson and Princeton with the third-most total Ivy League titles.
The last time Dartmouth won both titles was also its last basketball championship, as it has been more than a half-century since the Big Green could call itself the best of the Ancient Eight.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amanda Sobhy has not just been good this season for the Harvard women’s squash team, she has been flawless. The freshman wrapped up her undefeated year this weekend by sweeping through five opponents at the College Squash Association (CSA) Individual Championships, held at the Alumni Gymnasium in Amherst, Mass.
Sobhy recorded impressive results against top Ivy League competitors, including a 3-0 victory against Julie Cerullo of Princeton in the semifinals.
“It was a fairly one-sided match [in the semifinals],” Crimson coach Mike Way said. “There’s not much to say, except that the difference in level of play was obvious to everyone. It was a very quick match.”
In the finals, Sobhy beat Yale’s Millie Tomlinson, 3-0. Tomlinson, the defending champion, gave Sobhy her toughest match of the season. Although Sobhy defeated Tomlinson in three straight games, Tomlinson took 19 points off Sobhy—the most any competitor has all year long.
“Millie played extremely well, and Amanda took a little time to settle in the first game,” Way said. “Amanda really had to get her focus back…. She came through in the end, but the challenge was settling mentally, especially in the first two games.”
Although the final was a little more challenging, Sohby showed throughout the weekend why she was the No. 1  seed heading into the tournament. The freshman won all five of her matches in three games, and gave up at most seven points in one game. In the end, her opponents combined to score only 47 points against her, compared to her 165.
“There was definitely a lot [of] pressure on me, because I was definitely the big favorite to win,” Sobhy said. “At such a high level, there’s pressure to live up to, but I’ve been in these situations before and know how to handle [it].”
But this was not the first time that Sobhy has shown her power on the squash court. The Sea Cliff, N.Y. native was perfect all season at the No. 1 spot for Harvard, going 15-0 overall and 6-0 in Ivy League contests.
Some of the freshman’s most convincing wins came at crucial times for Harvard. Sobhy’s 3-0 sweep of the Tigers’ Cerullo helped the Crimson remain undefeated in a tight contest that Harvard won, 5-4. Sobhy also contributed to the squad’s Howe Cup victory by defeating the Bulldogs’ Tomlinson, 3-0, which helped the Crimson earn its 13th national championship. In her Howe Cup victory, Sobhy gave up only five points to Tomlinson.
Sobhy looks back very favorably on her first season playing for Harvard.
“To win all three [Ivies, National Championships, Individual Championships]—I couldn’t ask for a better first season,” Sobhy said. “Especially being with such a great team—the girls are all a great bunch, and it just makes the experience much more enjoyable.”
Not only has Sobhy excelled in collegiate play, but she has also been a staple in the squash community at large as one of its most prominent players.  She is currently the No. 1 ranked U.S. female squash player, and is ranked No. 20 in the Women’s International Squash Players Association.  Sobhy has won five WISPA tour titles and is the youngest player to win four WISPA crowns.
Although many players at Sobhy’s level decide to forgo college and continue on straight to the professional level from junior play, Sobhy is happy with her decision to attend Harvard.
“Going to college and getting an education was always a main priority for me,” Sobhy said. “If you have the chance to get a Harvard education, why not?  Plus, you play college squash to get that team experience, so I’m really glad I chose the college route. It’s only four years and then after that I can do all the professional tournaments that I want.”
One of Sobhy’s favorite victories was the 2010 Junior World Championships. A four-time U.S. Junior Nationals champion, Sobhy became the first U.S. player to ever capture the Junior World Championships crown.
“That was the greatest feeling because I won it on my 17th birthday,” Sobhy said.  “It was a really good birthday present for me. Plus, I beat a girl I’d never beaten before, so it was a really great accomplishment.... It was good for U.S. squash and good for myself–it got my name out there on the map.”
Sobhy can now add a CSA Individual Championship to her fond memories of squash victories.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is no secret that despite more and more rigorous admissions policies, there are certain high schools that send a disproportionate number of students to Harvard. Roxbury Latin, Philips Exeter and Philips Andover, the list goes on; all these schools have long-established academic traditions that allow their students to distinguish themselves for the admissions office.
There are certain schools that endear themselves to Dean Fitzsimmons and company for another reason: their athletic programs. Over the next few weeks I will be exploring this interplay between academics and athletics in the admissions process, beginning with two public schools in California: Los Gatos and Corona Del Mar. Each school has six student-athletes on Crimson rosters, the most of any public school in the nation.
A COMMUNITY OF SUPPORT
As public schools, Corona Del Mar and Los Gatos are not able to recruit and support athletics in the same way that their private counterparts can. However, both schools have benefited from being in prosperous communities with high property taxes, and therefore greater school funding.
“I don’t know if it’s justified, but you hear other people say that it’s the public school that acts like a private school,” sophomore football player Andrew Berg said of Los Gatos, his alma mater.
Los Gatos is located in the heart of Silicon Valley and is host to the headquarters of Netflix and Image Shack. And according to the U.S. Census Bureau, over a quarter of families living in Newport Beach, where Corona Del Mar is located, have an annual income over $200,000.
“A lot of this can be attributed to being in a community where we’re privileged to have these opportunities,” said Evan Zepfel, a senior on the men’s water polo team and Corona Del Mar graduate. “There are parents who have the time and money to drive us to practice every day and we’ve just been lucky to have the opportunity to dedicate this much time to athletics. Without the support network back home, I know I wouldn’t be here and I can say with a fair amount of confidence that most of us wouldn’t be here without athletics.”
There is, however, a difference between excelling in athletics alone and being able to handle Harvard’s academic requirements.
Brandon Vance, now a bartender and track coach at San Jose City College, coached seniors Christine Reed and Nico Weiler in the pole vault at Los Gatos.
“Traditionally, the school values academics first,” Vance said. “The community here is very strong, and the high school doesn’t support sports that strongly. Realistically, the message from the administration is school first. So you end up having these kids like Christine—one of our better students—that is also an athlete. You really get well-rounded kids.”
A TRADITION OF SUCCESS
“Every single person at Harvard from Corona Del Mar is an athlete,” Zepfel noted. “Now that I think about it, as far back as I can remember, every person from my school who went to an Ivy League, or Ivy-League-caliber, school was an athlete.”
The Corona Del Mar water polo program has won 13 California Southern Section championships and, with Evan’s younger brother Ben joining the class of 2016, will have had at least one representative on the Crimson for eight straight years.
“I have no idea why it’s happened,” Zepfel said. “When I was a senior, there were three seniors on the team. We were the top three students in our class and we went to Princeton, Harvard, and MIT. There’s definitely a tradition of academic success combined with success in the pool.”
Corona Del Mar has also benefited from the presence of freshman Evan Ramsey. Ramsey’s father, Christopher, is the Chief Executive Officer of U.S. Water Polo, and part of a larger community in Newport Beach, which is very supportive of water polo.
“There aren’t that many colleges that play water polo and, at least for me, it was tough looking at a certain quality of schools,” Zepfel said of his college decision. “It kind of limits the ones you can pick to seven or eight: Harvard, Princeton, Brown, Stanford, UCLA, Cal-Berkeley, and Claremont McKenna.”
Sport-specific success is common across the board. Reed, now the co-captain of the Harvard women’s track team, noted that every coach at Los Gatos had competed at the Division-One level, including former Olympian Karl Keska. As a result, there are currently three Los Gatos grads on the Crimson track team.
“It clusters by sport,” Reed said. “Coaches realize that they can start recruiting from a single area and athletes realize that it’s possible to go to certain schools. For me, seeing Sally Stanton ’08 [another Los Gatos grad] succeed here in my discipline really made me step back and think that I might be able to do the same.”
LEAVING THE WEST COAST
Despite their significant presence on campus, there is at times a conceptual barrier for Californians choosing a school in the Northeast as their college destination.
“It’s a little bit random just because we’re a pretty small town where going to the East Coast for school is not really the norm,” Reed said. “The California state system is so good, academically and athletically, that most people who go to high school in Los Gatos stay in California.”
They are not only traveling far from home, but also giving up something that is routinely bemoaned by students from warmer latitudes: the weather.
Zepfel noted that he worked out with his brother, Ramsey, and Jeff Reed ’11 over winter break.
"In a lot of ways it was just like being in practice at Harvard. The only difference is we were in California in the sun instead of freezing on the walk across the river.”
But water polo and track are two sports that are traditionally dominated by sunny states. For others, the decision was more straightforward.
“Field hockey is an East-Coast-based sport,” said Noel Painter, a freshman who led the Crimson with eight goals her rookie season and also attended Los Gatos. “California only has four colleges with field hockey, so the only places I looked at were on the East Coast. When you talk to normal people here, they know what field hockey is, that’s just not the case back home.”
Beyond the weather and popularity of the various sports, the Harvard name also plays a significant role in the recruiting process.
“When I first started getting recruited, I decided that this could be something special,” Berg said. “It’s not really something that most people get to do. I could have stayed close to home and been comfortable, or I could come out here and try to do something different. Now that we have a good-sized community of Los Gatos kids here, hopefully that gives kids a little extra confidence to take a shot and apply, whether they’re athletes or not.”
ADJUSTING EXPECTATIONS
Athletes who come from heavily involved high school programs note a strange dichotomy in the transition to playing for the Crimson. The time they commit to their sports is often inversely proportional to the number of fans attending.
“I played in front of two or three thousand people in high school, and you get used to having at least a relatively full support structure,” Zepfel said. “That’s not to say we never get [any fan support] here, but we kind of have to work for it. I don’t know if things would be different at a different school, but just in terms of the entire school’s mindset towards athletics, it was weird at first playing games with no one there. It was really weird.”
Not only is there often a lack of fan support—especially for the more obscure sports—but there is also in many ways a cultural disconnect between the way athletics are viewed in high school and how they are perceived on Harvard’s campus.
Corona Del Mar has a policy that requires students to play a sport for at least two years. If you cannot make a team, you are forced to take physical education classes as an equivalent.
“I wouldn’t say you were looked down upon, but it was definitely socially stigmatizing if you weren’t on a varsity team at CDM,” Zepfel said.
Los Gatos, which is in a joint school district with nearby Saratoga High School, similarly gives athletics a special cultural significance.
“Kids are given the option of going to Saratoga or Los Gatos, and the stereotype is that Los Gatos is for the athletes and Saratoga is for the smart kids,” Reed said. “There’s a lot of pride in the athletics at Los Gatos. Being on a sport there is definitely a socially significant thing. But the academics are very important as well.”
The adjustment from high school to college is rarely an easy one for any college freshman, and even more so for those with such immediate commitments as off-season workouts and daily practices. In preparing psychologically for college, students often lionize the college experience. Transitioning to a culture that puts academics so far above athletics often forces student-athletes who have committed to the Crimson to temper their expectations.
“Everyone in town goes to football games in high school,” Berg said. “Here, you’re not seeing your neighbors or your buddies at the games. With less of a community of support and more rigorous academics, the lifestyle is definitely more stressful here. At the same time, it’s college so it’s more fun.”
THE STUDENT-ATHLETE AT HARVARD
People often criticize the emphasis that American culture puts on intercollegiate athletics as misplaced. Unlike the majority of the world, athletics in the United States are primarily organized on the scholastic level. Indeed, it was only last month that U.S. Soccer fell into line with the rest of the world and totally divested its developmental academies from high schools.
The student-athlete is a popular archetype in the American psyche, and if anything can be learned from the narratives of the athletes from Corona Del Mar and Los Gatos, it’s that the archetype is still very much alive in corners of the country.
“When I decided to come here, I knew that sports would take a back seat,” Painter said. “You come here for your education and field hockey or football comes second, or third. One thing that’s great is that my time playing sports and taking hard classes at Los Gatos definitely honed my time management skills.”
Time management is not only a skill that most college students struggle with, but also one that is made even harder when a number of hours each day are being filled up by commitments to an athletic team.
“With six hours being taken out of your day, it really forced you to manage your time if you wanted to succeed in high school,” said Zepfel, an Economics concentrator who turned in his senior thesis less than an hour before meeting with me. “Now that water polo is over, I’ve gotten terrible at managing my time. I wake up in the morning and don’t know what to do with my day, and end up getting nothing done.”
The role that athletics plays in the admissions process at Harvard is a touchy subject in campus discourse. Despite the self-imposed requirements of the Academic Index, the process of recruiting and the likely letter is often misunderstood. At the same time, the Ivy League has a surprisingly high attrition rate in its athletics due to the lack of binding athletic scholarships.
No matter how one feels about student-athletes at Harvard, what’s happening in the classrooms and on the playing fields of Los Gatos and Corona Del Mar can’t be ignored.
“[Los Gatos is the] best place in the world to be a teacher and a coach,” Vance said. “The kids are driven, and I feel like that comes from the community. People just want to make themselves better, and even though I’ve never been to Harvard, I feel like it’s the same environment there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In his prime, Michael Jeffrey Jordan of the Chicago Bulls was untouchable.  MJ’s signature fadeaway jumpers, stifling defense, and ability to finish at the rim elevated him to a level of greatness that no other basketball player in history has reached. No one could stop His Airness on a basketball court.
Harvard sophomore Ali Farag did his best Jordan impersonation over the weekend at the CSA Individual Championships. And though he didn’t have a basketball in his hands like MJ, Farag was equally unstoppable with a squash racket.
In a field of the 32 best collegiate squash players in the country, Farag did what he has done all season long: He won every time he stepped on the court. The transfer student from Cairo, Egypt swept each of his five matches, including the national championship match against a familiar rival, Columbia’s Ramit Tandon.
Though Tandon and Farag did not face off this season, the two have competed with one another for years, most notably in the Junior British Open.
Farag’s match with Tandon was his closest of the weekend. In the opening game, with the score netted at 10 points apiece, the sophomore was in danger of dropping his first game of the tournament. But Farag was able to rise to the occasion when it mattered most, picking up the next two points for a 12-10 victory.
“Squash is more of a mental game than a physical game,” Farag said. “[Tandon] probably wasn’t physically tired, but mentally tired. He started to make mistakes [at the end of the first game].”
Farag carried his momentum into the match’s final two games, as he edged out Tandon and earned the championship, 12-10, 11-8, 11-4.
When he stepped off the court, the first thing Farag did was call his older brother, Wael, and share the good news.
“[Wael] was so tense,” Farag said. “I gave my mother my Blackberry before the match and she was constantly updating him.”
Before advancing to the championship round against Tandon, Farag swept Trinity’s three-time All-American Vikram Malhotra, who picked up a game against Farag when the pair met in late January. In the other semifinal match, Tandon bested defending national champion Todd Harrity of Princeton in three games.
“I watched [Tandom and Harrity’s] match the night before,” Farag said. “I wouldn’t say that I studied their games, but I looked at their weaknesses and their strengths. I was happy to play anyone [in the final].”
Whereas Harrity took home the individual title a year ago playing a power game, Farag’s teammates attribute his success to his creativity and tact.
“He’s comfortable hitting shots from all areas of the court,” Crimson co-captain Will Ahmed said. “A lot of times, he hits shots that, quite frankly, you’re not supposed to hit. But when you can hit them as smoothly and beautifully as he does, you can get away with it…. For someone who hasn’t seen a lot of squash, it would almost look artistic.”
As much as Ahmed admires how Farag handled his business on the court, he also credited the sophomore for not letting his unparalleled success get to his head.
“He’s extremely humble, almost to a fault,” Ahmed said. “He’s encouraging of his teammates, and he’s exactly the type of player that you’d want as your No. 1.”
Farag is no stranger to the kind of success that he enjoyed over the weekend. His resume also includes individual titles from the World Junior Open and the Junior British Open.
“[Winning this championship] was a bit different because I was playing for Harvard, not just for myself,” Farag said. “Colin West ’10 won [the national championship] two years ago, and I wanted to get it back to Harvard this year.”
With players like Farag and the CSA women’s individual champion, Crimson freshman Amanda Sohby, bursting onto the scene, Harvard may be changing the nature of collegiate squash.
“[Having Farag and Sohby] is going to attract other strong players,” Crimson coach Mike Way said. “Our sport is growing, there are new teams coming into the program, and the level of squash—the bar has been raised. Other schools are going to step up their recruiting.”
As just a sophomore, Farag will remain a daunting force to anyone seeking individual glory in collegiate squash for two more seasons. If he can duplicate this season’s Jordan-esque dominance in his junior and senior campaigns, Farag may be able to steal another page from MJ’s book and win a national championship three years in a row.
“I don’t want to put pressure on him,” Ahmed said. “But you have to imagine that he’s in pretty good shape to [win the Individual Championships] the next two years, barring injuries or a player that no one’s heard of yet.”

After a tough, overtime loss to the Boston Celtics on Sunday, Jeremy Lin and the Knicks were not able to bounce back against the Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday night.  The Knicks were defeated, 95-85, by the Mavs at the American Airlines Center.
Jeremy Lin’s less-than-stellar performance contributed to the Knicks’ struggles.  Lin scored 14 points, only half of what he contributed in the Feb. 29 home win against Dallas.  The Harvard grad had only two turnovers and seven assists, but it was not enough to propel the now-struggling team to victory.
The Knicks threatened a comeback at the start of the fourth quarter, scoring 15 points in a row within the first seven minutes.  Amare Stoudemire led the charge, with 26 points overall, while Lin sat on the bench during the seven-minute span.
Dirk Nowitzki and Jason Kidd were the top scorers for the Dallas team, putting up 28 and 15 points, respectively.
Tuesday’s loss now gives the Knicks a 2-3 record in their last five games.  Lin and the Knicks will look to recapture the magic on Wednesday night as they take on the San Antonio Spurs at Madison Square Garden.

As part of our Housing Market series, we'll be posting reviews and rankings for each of Harvard's 12 residential Houses over the next few days. Click here to read more about the series.
Nestled snugly between Harvard Square shops and restaurants, Adams House, incorporated in 1931, is the oldest of the Harvard Houses and also the closest House to the Yard. Most of the buildings of Adams House were built as Gold Coast dormitories at the turn of the century to provide rich Harvard undergraduates with a luxurious alternative to the antiquated Yard dorms. In previous years, Adams has dominated the House rankings due to its superb location and beauty.
House Spirit: Unlike other Houses, Adams doesn't display their House spirit blatantly, preferring to keep their House pride on the inside—quiet but strong. Adams House builds a sense of community through notable events such as Drag Night and Carpe Noctem. Residents fondly wrote about the "warmth of community" and tradition provided by the  regular Apthorp Teas at the House Masters' residence. While some residents applauded the tightly knit community, others found it lacking. A handful of Adamsians were merely lukewarm about House spirit. A resident referred to "lack of IM attendance" as evidence of low House spirit. Another commenter recognized Adams could do better. "Not the best House community, but very close." This year, Adams was tenth out of 12 in House spirit.
Housing Quality: Residents raved about the housing, claiming that it's possible to have "huge rooms even sophomore year" and "living is legendary by senior year." Rooms in Adams tend to be spacious and refined, and the wood molding and dark-wood fireplaces keep residents from feeling like they live in a concrete box (too soon?). Adams may have nice housing, but be prepared for uninvited visitors. Residents have complained that it suffers from invasion by the bane of all River Houses: cockroaches and mice. (Although others add that they have never spotted either.) Regardless, Adams is still prime real estate. As one commenter put it, "When it rains, it takes a whole minute to get to class." All in all, Adams came in at number nine.
Dining Hall: The dining hall was consistently cited by commenters as the worst part of Adams House, not because it's not a beautiful d-hall, but because others are aware of that fact, too. At just a hop skip away from the Yard, Adams is a popular choice for a lunch break between classes. And that's the problem. Good luck finding a seat because due to its central location, Adams is typically overcrowded. Adams residents are notoriously disgruntled when, as one resident says, "randos eat in our dhall." Despite strict dining restrictions, non-Adams residents still manage to slip in during peak hours. On top of the "busy and hectic" environment, the food isn't the best and the bulky wooden chairs can be a nuisance. Adams fizzled in the dining hall rankings, landing twelfth out of 12.
Facilities: Adams is known for its old world Harvard aesthetic appeal, proudly reflected by its elegant architecture and gold-leafed walls. It boasts of a beautiful—albeit dimly lit—library and cozy study nooks that offer quiet places to work in solitude or with a small group. Its underground tunnels are covered in creative murals hand painted by past Adams students, and the Upper and Lower Common Rooms are ideal places to host meetings or study groups. Overall, Adams' common spaces are both charming and historic.
Rating: Proximity to the Yard and a loving House staff seem to have trumped the House's failings. Residents have a deep affection for their House Masters, Resident Dean, and tutors, who "make Adams house a really great place to be!!!" As one Adams resident wrote, "I didn't feel at home at Harvard until I moved here." In terms of Adams, it is clear that overall reputation caused poll participants to place it on the high end; in regards to specific factors, Adams was relatively lukewarm. But as the popular saying goes, reputation is everything, and in the end Adams House ranked fourth out of 12.

As part of our Housing Market series, we'll be posting reviews and rankings for each of Harvard's 12 residential Houses over the next few days. Click here to read more about the series.
Creative housing video? Check. Stellar House Masters? Check. Convenient location? Double check. Quincy students can say that they fared quite well in the housing lottery.  Said one Quincyite, "Everyone loves Quincy...Plus we're being renovated first. The proof is in the pudding."
House Spirit: Quincyites love to gush about their House and show off their Penguin Pride. "Friendliest house on campus!" and "Great sense of community and spirit!" were typical responses to Flyby's poll. Students can eat, work out, and party without leaving the courtyard. Due to Quincy's central location, many students feel that there is really no need to leave. Popular House Masters—and their highly-attended study breaks—help breed House spirit, as does the annual Quincy Field Day. However, despite rave reviews from Quincyites themselves, Quincy came in eleventh in this category.
Housing Quality: Though cramped walk-through bedrooms in Old Quincy were a frequent complaint, students can expect N+1 housing starting in 2014. New Quincy, though not the most aesthetically pleasing building on campus, boasts large rooms and common spaces that are well suited for throwing parties. "Sometimes, Quincy just parties too hard for me to go to bed at a decent hour on Friday night," one Quincyite said. "But that's okay," the reviewer added. Quincy is ranked sixth for housing quality—in other words, solidly average.
Demonstrating true Penguin Pride, Quincyites are excited about upcoming renovations of Old Quincy. 180 students will live in swing housing in Harvard Square next year, and residents reported being thrilled about not having to live in Old Quincy. To bring together a soon-to-be more dispersed community, Quincy HoCo plans to spend more money on Penguin Pub, Quincy's Stein Club.
Dining Hall: With floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Mt. Auburn St. and Quincy Courtyard, the Quincy d-hall is light and airy. Students love the dining hall staff, and the dining hall is a central gathering place for students, making Quincy "the student center we never had" in the words of one reviewer. That said, Quincy is also a central gathering place for students from other Houses, so it is sometimes difficult to find a seat during peak dining hours, and the lines for food can be lengthy. Other reviewers put down the "ugly mural in the dining hall" as a complaint about the House. Overall, beautiful window views combined with overcrowding means Quincy comes in seventh place with respect to its dining hall.
 
Facilities: Quincy features various meeting spaces, though it can be hard to nab a reservation. By far the most popular facility, however, is Quincy Grille, where students can indulge in greasy food and are bound to run into people they know. With nearby ping pong and pool tables—and the d-hall right upstairs—the Grille area is an ideal spot for students to hang out. Students can also take advantage of the Quincy pottery studio.
Rating: According to one student, "It's Quincy. There was Quinception. Enough Said." With its central location, stellar senior housing—and, after the upcoming renovations, improved underclassman housing—and popular House Masters, Quincy is a standout, coming in third out of 12.
Our rankings so far:
3. Quincy
4. Adams
5. Lowell
6. Pforzheimer
7. Leverett
8. Currier
9. Mather
10. Winthrop
11. Cabot

Stuck in Cambridge for the break? No need to worry: Flyby presents Staycation 2012, a brief guide to fulfilling all of your spring break needs right here in the 02138. Enjoy.
Sun: There's no guarantee of warm weather in Boston next week, but if you're looking to experience the sun, take a tour of the Massachusetts State House—its golden dome looks like a sun shinging from the top of Beacon Hill. If you want more sun at the end of the day, you can always eat dinner at Vinh Sun BBQ and Restaurant in Chinatown.
Relaxation: Flyby wouldn't suggest relaxing by the beach at this time of year, but what about learning the arts of meditation and defense? The Boston School of Boabom is offering free introductory classes next week, on Tuesday at 8 p.m. and Saturday at noon. Relieve stress and learn something new in the process.
Bronze: Friends who go to warm places will come back with beautifully tanned skin. Aside from the multitude of spray tanning salons in Boston, there are many other ways to bring bronze into your life. Start by exploring the multitude of bronze sculptures downtown, including one honoring the book "Make Way for Ducklings" by Robert McCloskey.
Culture: One of the most important part of any vacation is experiencing the culture of your destination. Take the T to the Blue Hills to hike and explore a new part of Boston. Or, rent a Zipcar and drive up the New England coast, maybe with the goal of a tour of the Newport mansions, or a lobster in Maine.

This month, many seniors will breathe long sighs of relief as they finally turn in their alternately adored and loathed theses. Listed below is a small sample of some of the fascinating and unusual works of scholarship that this year's seniors have produced.
Bryce J. Gilfillian '12
Concentration: History
Thesis: Unmasking the American Man: Superheroes, Security, and Alternative Depictions of Masculinity in the American Postwar Era, 1945-1954.
Who knew that Superman and Lois Lane only became an item in the later decades of the comic or that Batman was once depicted as possibly having a homosexual relationship with Robin? Gilfillian uses the adventures of Superman, Batman, and Captain America to investigate how masculinity was explored in comic books of the era. In his research (which, yes, involves reading hundreds of comic books and drawing skeptical glances from Widener librarians), Gilfillian challenges the notion that superheroes were heterosexual, Christian "defenders of women and American virtue" and sheds light on the nuances of how manhood was conceived during the post-war years.
Maxwell L. Meyer '12
Concentration: Economics, East Asian Studies Secondary
Thesis: China's Authenticity Problem: Rethinking Anti-Counterfeiting Strategies in Low Enforcement, High Technology Environments.
Meyer's journey began in Xiu Shui Jie, a giant fake goods market near the heart of Beijing. He had recently given in and bought a set of Dr. Dre headphones for around $350 and was surprised to encounter an excellent identical, but fake, pair in the market, which he bought for the equivalent of $20. Since then, Max has investigated how to persuade individuals to buy the real good when the counterfeit looks and works just as well. Through conversations with government officials, newfound friendships with store owners, and savvy uses of Chinese Twitter, Max draws upon novel research to make several timely proposals for luxury goods companies doing business in China.
Jeremy Patashnik '12
Concentration: Economics
Thesis: Free Riding: Group-Size Effects in a Public-Goods-Game Model of Bicycle Racing
If Lance Armstrong were to talk to Patashnik, he might be happy to discover he's been participating in a public goods game while rocking the Tour de France. In his thesis, Patashnik breaks new ground by mixing game theory and professional sports, applying the economic concept of "freeriding" (i.e. reaping the benefits of others' cooperation without cooperating oneself) to competitive cycling. Freeriding can occur in cycling when riders choose to enjoy the efforts of riders at the front—who do more work by blocking wind—without spending significant time at the front themselves. This dynamic occurs both within the main group of cyclists (the "peleton") and the small group of riders that often break off during a race (the "breakaway".) After many hours of reading race descriptions and logging data points from the Tour de France and the Giro d'Italia, Patashnik has uncovered insights into the game theory of cycling, including a greater likelihood of freeriding within the main pack of  cyclers than within breakaways.
Colin Teo '12
Concentration: Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, Film Studies Secondary
Thesis: Sculpting the Flower—A Single Gene Duplication Underlies Complex Patterns of Functional Evolution in the Columbine Flower (Aquilegia).
Some people stop to smell the roses. Teo pauses to investigate the genetic basis of flower development. For the past year, Teo has been pursuing the question of "what makes flowers." Most labs studying flowers use the Thale Cress—the plant equivalent of the lab rat—to look at plant genomes. However, as Teo notes, "if you really want to know about the tree of life, you can't just look at one plant." At the lab where he works, Teo has been growing mutant versions of the Columbine flower through a process called gene silencing, which involves "tricking" the flower to cut up relevant parts of its own RNA by introducing a virus. He's discovered interactions between genes in this species that have never been seen before. And, all of this occurs in an underground growth chamber with minutely controlled lighting, humidity, and temperature.
Caroline N. Vloka '12
Concentration: Human Evolutionary Biology
Thesis: The gastrocnemius as a factor for human bipedalism
The creators of "Chicken Run" probably didn't realize they were onto significant scientific insights on the evolution of human bipedalism (bipedalism: that we walk on two legs). Fortunately, Vloka did. The HEB concentrator has been throwing guinea fowl (according to Caroline, a fairly "athletic chicken" with a human-like calf muscle structure) onto treadmills to investigate how we've evolved to move. She's uncovered information about how the calf muscle's angle changes as we increase speed, as well as the crucial role of the Achilles tendon in running. Her research also bolsters the claim of five-toe-shoe advocates: humans have evolved to run with the front of the feet striking ground first, a movement the admittedly "not fashion forward" shoes facilitate.

Before Linsanity swept the nation, Jeremy Lin '10 was just like us, posting insights about his personality and day-to-day life on Facebook. But Lin has recently switched his Facebook to the new timeline format, and apparently taken down all his public statuses from before Feb. 24. Fortunately, Flyby scooped some of Lin's best status updates from 2011 before he made it big.

It is not unusual for a House to ridicule its rivals in video form, as payback for being made fun of in previous years. And this week has seen much of the same. With just days to spare, more videos from Leverett, Cabot, Currier, Winthrop, Kirkland, Quincy, Dunster, and Pfoho have joined the list that is 2012's Housing Season. Here's a recap of the new additions.
It seems that spoofs are in vogue this year, at least in Winthrop. Inspired by the old classic "Stop in the name of Love," Winthrop's first video, "Throp In The Name of Love" features their lion mascot dancing to lyrics like: "JFK walked these halls." The second video "Throp Gun" is an adaptation of the "Top Gun" trailer, and brags about Winthrop's four years of Straus Cup glory.
Following the trend, Cabot released "House Like You," a rendition of Adele's hit song "Someone Like You." It tells a sad tale of two unfortunate freshmen lotteried into River Houses, who still dream of someday, somehow, making it into Cabot.
Dunster makes its season debut with "Now That's What I Call Housing," a medley of nine clips of popular songs whose lyrics have been rearranged to insult the other Houses. On the House's YouTube page, Henry Dunster Moose promises to release longer versions from the collection, which currently includes: "Because I Got Lowell," "It Sucks in Quincy," and "Lev Stinks."
The weekend also saw the return of Quincy, Leverett, Kirkland, and Currier to our screens. A series of short "This is Quincy House" videos were released, giving us brief 30-second glimpses of the Quincy House mascot, the penguin, in various aspects of House life such as laundry, parties, and dining.
Kirkland has put out two new unofficial offerings: this video, which co-opts Jimmy Kimmel's Halloween prank, using clips of adorable children throwing tantrums to the news that that they have been placed in other Houses, and this one, which riffs off of Dunster's past Old Spice spoofs.
Leverett's official video, "Lev Solo Cup," was described in the House's e-mail to freshmen as an "ode to Toby Keith," and is modeled after Keith's "Red Solo Cup." With its country music instrumentals, the song's lyrics boast of Lev's favorite famous alum, Jeremy Lin.
This unofficial video, a short film from Currier, follows two scientists and their unidentifiable accents, as they measure the hallways of each of the twelve Houses. In the end, using an extremely complicated mathematical and scientific argument in which long hallways are equivalent to greatness, the video postulates that Currier = longest hallways = best House.
Finally, Pfoho just came out with a Housing Day music video, a riff off ABC by the Jackson Five, featuring five adorable polar bears.
Flyby is still waiting for a video from Lowell. In the meantime, the House has released two songs, "I Believe in a Thing Called Lowell" and "Baby Got Bells" on its tumblr blog.
