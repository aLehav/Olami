After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

The life of Eliza B. Mantz ’18 is probably not compliant to Occupation Safety and Health Administration standards. She recounts, laughing, a story about fiddling with the new light setup of the Loeb Experimental Theater while dangling precariously off the top of a 15-foot ladder, legs wedged in the spaces between the rungs. Evidently, the excitement of the theater does not lie solely on the stage.
Mantz is just as comfortable being in the spotlight as she is aiming it—her time doing theater at Harvard has been split almost evenly between serving on the crews and acting as part of the casts. “Since I’ve gotten here, every semester, I’ve acted in at least two shows and designed at least two shows,” Mantz says. “It’s really challenging but also really exciting, since it gives me two ways into the texts.”
A prolific theater-maker, Mantz has participated in about a dozen Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club shows in her just-over-three semesters at Harvard. She’s active within the community as well; she serves on the HRDC Board, overseeing the Loeb Experimental Theater, which the HRDC’s website aptly calls “the premier black-box space on campus.” Mantz has acted in plenty of roles, taking on roles that run the gamut from exotic dancer to band “momager.”
But Mantz enjoys working on the less visible aspects of theater as well. She’s well-versed in set construction and light design, with the deft manipulation of the latter being one of her areas of expertise. “That’s the thing about lights—people kind of forget about them. But that’s kind of why I love it, because it’s so underappreciated. It’s a really difficult medium, because you do have to be really careful not to make it feel awkward or make transitions or looks that take the audience out of the play,” Mantz says. “If you do your lights really well, people will say that they were unnoticeable, which is honestly kind of the goal.”
Mantz’s devotion to theater is echoed in her academic trajectory as well: She’s one of the dozen students enrolled in the fledgling Theater, Dance, and Media concentration. For Mantz, her contact with theater in an academic setting proves yet another source for inspiration in her theater-making. “The thing that we’re trying to do as TDM concentrators—but also as a theater community at large—is understand all that theater has been in the past and all it could be in the future,” Mantz says. “We can use that understanding of what was effective and what wasn’t effective to create something new.”
As its intensity would indicate, Mantz’s interest in theater is no passing infatuation. She knew she wanted to participate in theater from a very young age. “My family has a really long history of being involved, either directly or peripherally, in the arts,” she says. Her first performance was in her elementary school’s production of “Cinderella,” in which she played a cat. She participated primarily in musical theater until high school, when her interest began to shift towards non-musical drama. “I find that musical theater for me captures a very small amount of storytelling styles,” Mantz says.
And that, for Mantz, is the crux of the matter—using theater to tell stories. The theory and the practice of theater allow her to analyze the way the stories are told as well as actually to tell the stories themselves. “Storytelling is really where my passions lie, and I realized early on I could do it best and most effectively through theater,” she says. Mantz intends to continue her work to learn how stories were told: She plans to spend the upcoming summer abroad, researching the representation of non-white actors in Early Modern English theater. And she intends to continue telling as many stories as she can. Whether through her work with the HRDC or her plans for future theater work, much of Mantz’s own story yet remains to be written.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Camino de Santiago, a collection of pilgrimage routes to the shrine of St. James the Great in northwestern Spain, offers itself to anyone with perseverance and the ability to make good plans. Its travelers include backpacking aficionados and tourists as well as the devoutly religious. When Landon Roussel—Cambridge resident and primary care doctor at Mount Auburn hospital—undertook the trip for the third time, however, the road became a complex spiritual journey of reconciliation with his estranged brother, Cory. Soon after hiking the Camino, Cory died for reasons related to his drug addiction, prompting his older brother to chronicle their journey in his first book, “On the Primitive Way.”
The Harvard Crimson: What made you decide to write “On the Primitive Way?”
Landon Roussel: I think the idea came to me maybe a week or two after I found out that my brother was killed. He was killed in October of ’14, and as soon as I was writing his eulogy and trying to capture my memory of him—my memory of us, really—I realized that our story was too deep, too rich to just get down in a few pages. So the next logical thing would be to put it down in a book. Not only for our sake, for capturing our story, but for capturing the process that many people go through of trying to reconnect with their loved ones who they might have gotten separated from or estranged from or distanced from for whatever reasons. Be it addiction, be it prison, be it family drama… whatever it is.
THC: Was writing the book partly a form of therapy?
LR: It was extremely therapeutic to go back and relive not only the happy memories that we had but also the difficult ones as well. It forces me to make sense of not only the past but make it relevant to the present by writing about it.
THC: Do you think that over the course of the trip your relationship with your brother changed?
LR: Oh, it did, definitely. We had hardly spoken. Our  relationship was very, very stretched for a number of reasons, the main of which were drug abuse and prison. We just sort of getting hits and hits to our relationship. Afterwards, it wasn’t perfect by any means, but it was a sort of mutual understanding that we were going to commit to understanding each other.
C: What was your favorite part of the trip?
L: When we were walking to a town called Melide—and people who have walked the Camino de Santiago, at least the last hundred kilometers, will know this town, because it’s famous throughout all of Spain for its octopus—we had just had a disagreement that was tough. Not because of the disagreement itself but because of our past. Emotional memories of us disagreeing were, for me, very difficult because of experiences of his anger related to drug abuse. So as we were walking to Melide we had a disagreement that we were able to resolve peacefully and civilly, as many adult brothers who disagree should, and I just sort of felt a weight off my back. I remember my backpacking almost feeling lighter, as I had my wet clothes that I had pinned on the outside of my backpack earlier in the day to dry—I could almost feel the water evaporating off the clothes and feeling that was sort of an allegory for the weight which I had shed from our past together and the hurt that we endured.
C: Did your work as a doctor influence the writing of “On the Primitive Way?”
L: I remember having patients who were on the brink of death—or who have died—and that made it tough to deal with. Being with family members as their loved ones were dying while I was trying to grieve the loss of my own loved one. But it also gave me an added sympathy for them. Also, I still have patients who are dealing with addiction, and it really speaks to them when I tell them that my own brother dealt with it and was eventually killed in relation to it. It builds an incredible rapport. I feel like I understand where they’re coming from because I’ve dealt with it myself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At Harvard, perfection often feels like the norm. But for many students, under the veneer of confidence and accomplishment lies something darker. In a bubble that often seems to be defined by awards and achievements looms what current Crimson president Mariel A. Klein ’17 termed the Harvard Condition. The expression refers to “the appearance of normalcy but the reality of distress.” In her scrutiny, Klein explored the problem of mental illness on campus, and identified challenges that students with mental health problems face while at Harvard.
It is important to focus on how Harvard as an institution can do a better job addressing mental illness. The University must continue to assure students that University Health Services responds appropriately to those who seek treatment for their mental illnesses—by quickly scheduling consultations, and by following up with students after visits and meetings. But Harvard has a far greater responsibility than simply ensuring that students in need of help receive appropriate care. Harvard faculty and staff must make more of an effort to address how and why so many students are struggling with mental illness in the first place.
Many students who experience mental health problems cite alienation as a core contributor to their disorders. This intense loneliness is often experienced by freshmen, most of whom are without strong support on campus when they are forced to quickly acclimate to college life. Though Peer Advising Fellows (PAFs)—undergraduate mentors matched with students during their freshman year—play a critical role in helping freshmen smoothly transition to life at Harvard, they are merely undergraduate students themselves. These upperclassmen are too often unable to help freshmen with the challenges they face; in fact, many PAFs suffer from the same feelings of loneliness and mental health problems that their advisees experience.
It also seems unlikely that many of the current proctors and advisers can truly meet students’ needs, as a number lack the experience, knowledge, and time needed to deal with the many problems that students face. There are too many stories of academic advisers who told their advisees that they knew virtually nothing about academics at Harvard. There are too many students interested in the humanities who were paired with an over committed engineering graduate student who had little time, interest, or insight to provide to the student. And there are too many students who met individually with their academic adviser or proctor only once or twice throughout their entire freshman year.
Harvard must do a better job of matching students with mentors with whom they can form relationships and receive guidance, especially during their freshman year. There are many ways Harvard could address this issue. One way would be to guarantee that the freshman advisers are more experienced mentors who have the time and knowledge to help students. Harvard staff members could also work harder to ensure that students are matched with advisers whose academic interests align with the students’ interests. Furthermore, instead of requiring a student and adviser to meet solely before study card day, all advisers could be required to meet with their freshman advisees a set number of times throughout the year.
If students were paired with more senior advisers who could provide greater guidance, especially academically, they would feel less alone when adjusting to college life, and would perhaps face far fewer problems. When freshmen enter Princeton, for example, they are given a faculty adviser in the department in which they indicate interest. Once students declare a major, they are paired with a new faculty advisor from the department in which they are majoring. Harvard could draw upon this model to craft a new advising system that more thoroughly addresses the needs of its students.
Too often, college students make the mistake of already viewing themselves as adults. But the reality is that we’re not adults. We need help: We need more experienced adults who have perspectives that we cannot possibly have in our late teens and early twenties, and who have the time, interest, and knowledge to help us navigate Harvard and its challenges. We need mentors who are there to help us solve problems that may arise, academically and otherwise, so that we know we are not alone. Perhaps then we will be moving one step forward in addressing the mental illness epidemic that is raging across our campus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a tight race for Missouri’s 6th district Congressional seat back in 2008, Representative Sam Graves launched an attack campaign against his opponent, Kansas City Mayor Kay Barnes, over her “San Francisco Values.” One particularly risible attack ad featured scenes of champagne glasses clinking in the air interspersed with clips of flamboyant ethnics gyrating on each other to the beat of vaguely sexual elevator music. Graves’s margin over Barnes deepened after the commercial aired, leading to a 59-37% victory. Now, eight years later, Graves’s campaign manager and the mastermind behind the “San Francisco Values” bit —a man by the name of Jeff Roe—manages Ted Cruz’ presidential campaign.
But you didn’t need to know all this to tell that Cruz’s “New York values” jab at Donald Trump two Republican debates ago was nothing more than political theater. If you can remember what seems like years ago in election time, Cruz seemed ill at ease up on stage—unconvincingly making an entire city the punch line of a joke that the rest of the country was in on, then seeming too exhausted to deliver any of the million possible rebuttals against Trump’s uncomfortable exploitation of 9/11. He seemed like a candidate unaware of his eventual upset Iowa victory, ready to try anything to stop the Trump machine.
Perhaps Cruz does genuinely believe New York City is an accurate trope to highlight the most un-conservative parts of Trump—his “socially liberal, pro-abortion, pro-gay marriage” track record and his “focus around money and the media” as Cruz put it. Perhaps—and most likely, I’d say, considering his debate performance—he doesn’t. This hardly matters though, since Jeff Roe’s strategy—though distasteful and overblown—worked well before and was an important contribution to his victory over Trump in last Monday’s crucial battle of Iowa.
It’s worth noting first though that many of Trump’s most echt-New York qualities are what drew his adherents in the first place. Conor Freidersdorf writes in The Atlantic, “He’s big, loud, brash, unafraid to brag, and full of superlatives. He speaks his mind and has [a] high opinion of himself. He’s comfortable with being pushy and with open conflict. He values ruthlessness and winners.” It’s this New York bravado, this cosmopolitan penchant for melodrama that holds together the Savior complex that fuels the Trump machine: From a wretched hell full of PC witch hunts and being reminded that se habla español, The Donald will save Iowa—you know, the real America—and make it great again.
Cruz’s response to the angst of today’s middle American was far more effective, I think. Whereas Trump delivers exhausting outrage and gimmicky machismo, Cruz chose the more timeless approach of identity politics. Somewhere early on the campaign trail—probably when Trump’s support started to pick up—the senator stunningly rebranded himself from the Princeton debate champion and husband of a Goldman Sachs executive to the southern evangelical who likes his beer cold and guns hot. He became a hopeless bromantic of Trump, but only incidentally—as a side-effect of his focus on the culture war against moral decay and religious lethargy, a twin issue to Trump’s culture war against political correctness.
Accusing Trump of espousing New York values fits well into Cruz’s general strategy, and critics were too quick to declare Trump the winner of this altercation. Branding New York as a modern American Gomorrah surely alienates urban voters, presumptuously intervenes in the fruitless search for the “real America,” and of course obscures the truth: That New York represents vice and excess far less compellingly than it does limitless opportunity and vibrant multiculturalism. But that’s a small price to pay to exploit Trump’s greatest vulnerabilities—his social liberalism, his glitz, and other unforgivable red flags for the middle American voters who will likely choose the Republican nominee.
In these weeks after Iowa, Cruz will only attempt to further undermine Trump’s urban appeal, likely drawing connections between him and Hillary Clinton, a fellow denizen of New York and easy target for embodying the city’s values. Trump, for what it’s worth, has already done his part: In perhaps the most New York move of all time, he tweeted a threat to sue Cruz for rigging the caucuses. “Bad!” The great American bard ends his tweet accusing Cruz of not winning Iowa, but stealing it.
But not even self-destructive Trump can help Cruz’s cause if Cruz himself doesn’t press the “New York values” bit more believably and more often than he did on the debate stage two weeks ago. The Rubio supporter in me wishes he won’t. But the part of me that admires Cruz’s skillful ability to play the game is intrigued. In a particularly overpopulated field where candidates had to move, adapt, or die, Cruz has demonstrated a level of adaptability and a readiness to prioritize that just might take him to the White House. I would like to see that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past Sunday, five of Harvard's peer counseling groups launched QuadTalk, an initiative aimed at bringing mental health resources to the Radcliffe Quadrangle. All five groups involved in the project—Room 13, Eating Concerns Hotline and Outreach (ECHO), Sexual Health and Relationship Counselors (SHARC), Contact Peer Counseling, and RESPONSE Peer Counseling—have main offices in the Yard, River Houses, or at University Health Services; QuadTalk aims to ensure that students living in the Quad have easy access to the same services as their peers. Through the new program, the five groups will rotate responsibility for staffing Jordans South basement of Pforzheimer House each night from 8:00 to 11:00 p.m.
QuadTalk is an excellent initiative. It acknowledges the potential for substantial unmet need for these mental health services in the Quad, where distance from the main resources on campus could pose a significant obstacle for residents in need of them. Moreover, this initiative helps raise the visibility of mental health issues on campus and highlights Harvard’s commitment to providing support to its students.
We are especially impressed by the fact that this initiative was pioneered by Harvard undergraduates themselves. The peer counselors from these groups recognized the need for more resources in the Quad, and worked together efficiently with administrators to make QuadTalk a reality. We look forward to seeing how these groups will collaborate on this initiative and others in semesters to come.
Just as peer counseling services like those involved in QuadTalk are vital to student well-being, so too must professional mental health services be available and accessible to all students. Counseling and Mental Health Services at UHS—which provides students with clinicians who offer a range of services including individual counseling, group counseling, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and medication evaluation—helped secure space for the QuadTalk initiative, and plays a central role in ensuring that Harvard students can seek professional help when they need it.
In certain areas, however, UHS should take steps to ensure that its mental health services are more accessible for more students. In particular, past criticism has centered around a lack of diversity among Mental Health Services clinicians, which became a major issue during last semester's elections for the Undergraduate Council. Only 25 percent of Harvard Mental Health clinicians identify as people of color, and research shows that shared race or ethnicity between patients and clinicians breaks down barriers that often prevent people of color from seeking professional mental health services. While no easy solutions to this problem exist, UHS should strive to increase the diversity of its clinicians so that no student faces undue obstacles when they seek out mental health services.
Initiatives like QuadTalk are precisely the kind of project that Harvard should pursue as it seeks to make mental health services as accessible as possible for all its students. We applaud the students and administrators who have expanded peer counseling to the Quad, and hope to see further progress on this vital issue.

“You learn, no matter what age you are, to keep things to yourself,” Irish author Colm Tóibín writes in his most recent novel, Nora Webster. The book is based in large part on Tóibín's own experiences in his native Ireland.  The film adaptation of Tóibín's 2009 novel Brooklyn has been nominated for three Academy Awards. Fifteen Minutes managed to catch up Tóibín over e-mail in the midst of the mad rush of his book tour. He mused on memory, emotion, Machu Picchu, and banana sandwiches.
Fifteen Minutes: This issue is all about travel. How has living abroad — in a variety of different cultures and countries — influenced your writing?
Colm Tóibín: I think living in Spain affected me in every way, but after that I was probably too old to be influenced by anything much. I don't thinking living in the United States, for example, has made any difference to me at all.
FM: In a similar vein, how have your ties to your home country, Ireland, influenced your writing and reading life? Several novels of yours are even set in your hometown.
CT: I am not sure about Ireland. I come from Wexford and Wexford matters to me. It comes in dreams. I like it there. I suppose I am from there.
FM: When and why did you begin to write?
CT: I began writing poetry when I was 12. I don't know why.
FM: What do you find the most difficult stage in the writing of a novel?
CT: Every book is different, but I think each book has moments when the emotion becomes pure. You are almost working towards that all the time. It is important to release emotional energy, but also keep it under control.
FM: Are there any books you can’t travel without?
CT: No.
FM: Who are your favorite Irish authors?
CT: Yeats, Joyce, Beckett, John McGahern, John Banville.
FM: Is there a particularly comforting food, song, and/or memory that reminds you of home?
CT: Food? Cheaply made banana sandwiches. Song? Maybe some opera.
FM: What is your preferred method of travel?
CT: I like walking, but most places are too far away to walk.
FM: What have you found most enriching from living on college campuses and working as a professor?
CT: The library, the students, the general atmosphere of seriousness about learning.
FM: Can you describe one of the best vacations you’ve ever taken?
CT: I went to Peru when I was in my late twenties and I enjoyed that.  Especially Machu Picchu.
FM: As you’ve aged, has your approach to writing changed? Your process?
CT: No, it remains the same. It requires concentration. That doesn't change.
FM: Many of your books feature Ireland. Through the years you’ve been a writer, have you found that your descriptions or portrayals of the country have changed?
CT: I don't think I have ever written about Dublin. Maybe in one or two stories. But the rest is set in Wexford. Because I have a house there now and spend time there I think I see it more clearly.
FM: Your most recent book, Nora Webster, has been a long time coming — you’ve said previously that it took you an exceptionally long time to write. Why?
CT: A lot of it is based on memory, on things that happened. So it took longer to find a shape and a structure.
FM: What was the experience of seeing your novel Brooklyn reinterpreted by Hollywood?
CT: What happens is that the emotion which gave rise to the book comes back to you raw. It is an interesting experience, probably enriching.
FM: Are there any characters, from any of your novels, to whom you feel a particularly strong attachment?
CT: The best thing I have written is a story called 'A Long Winter'. I like the protagonist in that story.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 5, 2016, at 2:16 p.m.
Wearing white lab coats and singing hymns, a group of roughly 40 Harvard Medical School students delivered to Massachusetts Hall Thursday a petition calling for more diversity on their Longwood campus.
Last month, a group of Medical students began gathering signatures for the petition, demanding that the next dean of the school emphasize diversity among students, faculty, and staff. University President Drew G Faust and Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 have begun the search for a new dean, following current Medical School Dean Jeffrey S. Flier’s plans to step down in July. 
The group of students planned to deliver the petition to Faust, whose office is located in Mass. Hall, but she was not there to accept the petition, according to Nelson Malone, one of the petition’s main organizers. A Harvard University police officer did not allow the entire group of students to enter Mass. Hall because of  crowding concerns, so a smaller group of students entered the building to deliver the petition to a Mass. Hall secretary.
The petition, created by the student group Racial Justice Coalition, now boasts more than 300 signatures, according to several student organizers. Among their demands, the students ask that a new dean commits to increasing campus diversity and that a quarter of interviewed candidates for the deanship come from a background underrepresented in medicine.
In a Monday interview, Faust said a commitment  to diversity is an important qualification for becoming the next dean of the Medical School. Still, she said she was skeptical of establishing quotas for interview applicants. She said she has met with some medical students during the dean search.
“I think that the point that the person who leads the Med School ought to be a person with a deep commitment to diversity is absolutely right,” Faust said. “How we accomplish that I don’t think comes through quotas on interviews. We want the person who is going to see this as really an essential part of being an excellent dean.”
Malone said he hope Faust will respond within the next two weeks, and meet with them in person to discuss the petition.
Sanjay T. Kishore, a student organizer, said the group does not yet have further plans for action but will wait to see how Faust receives their petition and demands.
The students delivered their petition at a time when discussions of race and diversity dominate rhetoric across Harvard’s campus. At the end of last semester, students at Harvard Law School issued a series of demands to dean Martha L. Minow, to improve the school’s treatment of minority students. Meanwhile, at the College, House masters unanimously decided in December to change their title, in part citing the racial implications of the term “Master.” They have yet to decide on a new title.

Massachusetts State Police found the body of an unidentified male in the Charles River near the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Thursday morning.
Two joggers alerted authorities at 8:17 a.m. after they saw the body floating close to the Longfellow Bridge near Memorial Drive, Massachusetts State Police Director of Media Communications David A. Procopio wrote in an email.
State troopers responded to the call and the State Police Marine Unit arrived to retrieve the corpse from the water at about 8:30 a.m. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner has been working to identify the man since Thursday afternoon, Procopio wrote.
Troopers from both the Middlesex County District Attorney’s Office and the Massachusetts State Police are conducting the investigation, according to Procopio. As of press time, the office had not released further details on the individual’s identity and cause of death.
Cambridge Police Department spokesman Jeremy Warnick said the department is not involved in the investigation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a lull in activism over race relations at Harvard Law School, about 100 affiliates gathered at a “community meeting” Thursday afternoon to discuss the school’s controversial seal, which is currently under review. 
The committee to review the seal—which will release its recommendations to the Harvard Corporation in March—convened the meeting in the WCC center to solicit feedback on the seal.
Law School Dean Martha L. Minow created the student and faculty committee last November in response to demands for the seal’s removal by student activists from the group Royall Must Fall. The seal, which features the crest of the former slave-owning Royall family, was a focus of protests last semester about race and diversity at the Law School.
The review committee itself does not have the power to change the seal; rather, it aims to release a recommendation to the Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—which holds final decision-making authority. The committee has solicited feedback from Law School affiliates via email since November, and committee chair Bruce H. Mann said the group has received more than 150 messages so far.
The format of Thursday’s meeting diverged in practice from previous townhalls. Individuals broke into small groups along with committee members, who took notes on the discussion. Mann, who delivered the opening remarks and emphasized the importance of engaging a variety of viewpoints, said he hoped the format would help inform committee members about different opinions on the seal.
“Our hope is that this arrangement will enable people to listen to one another, and engage one another and members of the committee in a more conversational setting,” he said in his remarks.
Alexander J. Clayborne, a Law student affiliated with Royall Must Fall, said he was pleased at the turnout of faculty and staff at Thursday’s meeting. While he called the conversations that took place “robust,” he expressed disappointment at what he called a one-sided approach in favor of changing the seal. He said he had hoped Law School affiliates with opposing views would attend and debate the merits of the seal change with the activists.
“Student activists are accused of stifling free speech on campus, but whenever there is an opportunity to engage with people who disagree, the people who disagree don’t show up,” Clayborne said. “That’s a level of intellectual cowardice that needs to be called out.”
In the absence of dissenting voices, Clayborne said many conversations focused on the consequences of a potential committee recommendation to change the seal, though attendees did not create any definitive plans.
Since December, activists have been relatively quiet and members of several student groups—including Royall Must Fall, Reclaim Harvard Law, and the Black Law Students Association—declined to disclose their upcoming plans on the record. Meanwhile, the seal committee will meet later this month to deliberate, Mann said.

Cambridge residents saw double digit percentage increases in property values and rent for homes and apartments last year—a sharp rise that has City Council officials debating how to soften the blow.
The rental rate for single-bedroom apartments in the Harvard Square and Cambridge Riverside areas increased by 16.8 percent and 17 percent respectively in 2015, according to  Devin A. O’Brien, the head of strategic marketing for Zumper.com, a rental startup that uses data to analyze the market. The region experienced the greatest percentage increase in the Greater Boston area.
“In the next year, I don’t necessarily see things going down,” O’Brien said. “I see them going up at a lower rate of increase compared to the past year or two.”
The housing market saw a similar increase last year, following a trend that began in 2012, according to Charles P. Cherney ’89, the vice president of Cambridge-based Hammond Real Estate.
“It was the case that from 2005 to 2012, the Cambridge sales market was pretty stable,” Cherney said. Since then Cambridge residents have seen home prices raise by “ten percentage points a year.”
Cherney and Cambridge Vice Mayor Marc C. McGovern described the double-punch of increasing home prices and rents since the financial crisis as a “perfect storm” that has put a strain on new tenants and homebuyers.
“That’s the perfect storm of many buyers, recovering economy, low interest rates, and low supply,” Cherney said.
McGovern said local universities, including Harvard and MIT, could play a greater role in providing more affordable housing.
“The universities can do a huge amount. In fact they are one of the major players in the real estate development outlook for the city,” Cambridge City Councillor Nadeem A. Mazen said.
Currently, students at Harvard and MIT can pose a threat to families attempting to move into Cambridge, McGovern said.
“If you can put two or three or four graduate students in an apartment and those people are pooling their rent, a family can’t compete with that,” McGovern said. “Harvard actually does a pretty good job of housing their graduate students.”
Cambridge’s allure to potential new residents could also help explain why rates and prices have risen, according to McGovern.
“All these things we love about living in Cambridge—that means other people love them too,” McGovern said. “We are sort of a victim of our own success. We are a safe city, we have good jobs, we’re clean, the schools are good.”
While the Cambridge City Council cannot legally control rental prices, councillors have outlined potential ways to mitigate the effects of the costly housing market, including devoting funds to affordable housing. One of the many proposed solutions to the growing problem is inclusionary housing, where a percentage of newly constructed buildings are reserved for affordable housing developments.
Mazen said the City Council has among the best inclusionary housing programs in the state. When certain pricing thresholds are passed, a significant portion of residential development units must be reserved for affordable housing.
“If you're above a certain height or above a certain area, you need to start thinking about 12 percent for affordable housing,” Mazen said, referring to building size.
McGovern, a supporter of the inclusionary housing program, recommended introducing measures to the slow the rate of homes being converted to condominiums, which would make it easier for families to find homes.
Despite multiple solutions and councillors eager to implement changes, McGovern and Mazen both said the affordable housing crisis is partially outside their control.
“You’re putting band-aids on a cracked dam. It’s the most expensive area in the country some people say,” McGovern said.

Oggi Gourmet will move to the former home of Finale Dessert Shop on 30 Dunster Street, joining Clover Food Lab as an eatery that has successfully found new real estate in Harvard Square as it prepares to vacate its current location in the Smith Campus Center. 
While the renovations aren’t slated to begin until April, the restaurant will begin moving its equipment as early as next week. Although the physical location will be different, the square footage will remain about the same and customers should expect almost everything else to remain unchanged, Oggi Manager Elvett Welch said.
“Here it’s a… longer space and over there it is more like a square” Welch said. “You might not see everything at a length like this.”
Although Clover and Oggi have been successful in the search for a new space, several Smith Center businesses have yet to find new venues.
Al's Harvard Square Cafe, an eatery specializing in Italian subs, is still searching for a new location. Al’s employee Catherine Bonilla said customers ask almost everyday whether Al’s will be closing.
“We might open somewhere else, but probably not in the area.” Bonilla said.
Since its Harvard Square location opened in 2001, Al’s, which currently boasts four Boston-area locations, has been a fixture for students by offering their popular “bag lunch” meals, which consist of a sandwich, soda, and bag of chips.
Boston-based bakery and cafe chain Au Bon Pain, which resides in a larger storefront than Oggi and Clover, is also still looking for new real estate.
"Harvard Square is an important area to Au Bon Pain and Boston as a whole,” Au Bon Pain spokesperson Maria Feicht wrote in an email. “We hope to find another location in the near future that fits our needs and serves our guests in the same capacity."
The impending departure of Al’s comes as disappointing news to many students who are fans of the cafe.
“It is one of the few affordable places in the Square and will be greatly missed.” Chad J. Benoit ’16 said. “I will always remember the first time I went to Al's and got a large sandwich and failed to realize that it is nearly impossible for one human to eat a large-size Al's in one sitting.”
Other students, including Max W.  Liebeskind ’17, said they were more saddened by Au Bon Pain’s potential departure.
“I’m not a big fan of Al’s since I don’t think their sandwiches are that good,” Liebeskind said. ”Au Bon Pain is disappointing. It’s a great breakfast place.”

The Secondary Field in Global Health and Health Policy is offering the College’s first-ever course in humanitarian studies this spring, featuring an optional three-day crisis simulation in the forest at the end of the semester.
The course, entitled GHHP 70: “Global Response to Disasters and Refugee Crises,” is intended to teach students to apply global health theory and policy to real-world humanitarian crises, according to course heads Michael J. VanRooyen and Stephanie Kayden, who are medical doctors and have worked in crisis areas.
“Part of our interest is to introduce this topic of humanitarian assistance as its own discipline,” VanRooyen said. “For us, it’s really identifying it as a new and dynamic field.”
Kayden expressed her hope that the new course would help students understand the realities on the ground in the many disaster areas around the world.
“We want them to understand what it means to be a refugee, how the international community is designed to respond to disasters and refugee crises,” Kayden said.
The new course culminates in an optional crisis simulation in which students can apply what they’ve learned in a more realistic setting. Students will spend three days in a forest by North Andover, experiencing “the discomfort of being in the field,” according to VanRooyen.
The students in GHHP 70 will play the role of refugees, while graduate students, humanitarian professionals, and members of the U.S. military will act as aid workers.
“They have to work in teams,”  VanRooyen said. “They work with U.N. agencies and military and NGOs and child soldiers and rebel militias and news media and all of those things to really understand the feeling of the field and to perform within it.”
The simulation, which has run for more than 10 years, has grown “in complexity and nuance” since its first iteration, VanRooyen said. Prior to this semester, the simulation run by the course heads was only available to graduate students and professionals in the field of humanitarian aid.
Assistant Director of the GHHP Undergraduate Program Christy L. Colburn approached VanRooyen and Kayden about teaching a course at the College after participating as a volunteer in the simulation herself last year.
“I knew that undergraduates would be really interested in this and that there’s nothing like this at the College currently,” Colburn said. “We have a number of courses that talk about global health and theory, but there’s nothing where they can practice it and put it into a real world context.”
Student response to the new course offering has been enthusiastic, with about 120 students entering a lottery for only 25 spots, according to VanRooyen. VanRooyen said he hoped the course’s presence at Harvard would positively influence future research.
“Our structure and experience base and research base at Harvard is unique,” VanRooyen said.“The aid world has recognized the importance of university presence, like Harvard, to contribute to the development of leaders in the future.”

Freshmen will soon have more opportunities to exercise their creativity thanks to a new initiative by the Freshman Dean’s Office to extend the hours of the Freshman Arts Room.
Located in Holworthy Basement, the space is commonly used for evening workshops and the artistic pursuits of freshmen, but is currently only open on Wednesdays from 8 p.m. to midnight. The new initiative extends those hours to 24/7.
“It’s something that’s been on our minds, as the arts space has become increasingly more utilized with students,” said Torey E. Martin, the FDO’s fellow for First Year Programs. “We wanted to try out a model similar to the music practice rooms.”
To implement the change, the FDO, with the assistance of Yard Operations, installed a new card reader at the entrance of the Arts Room which will allow students to enter 24 hours a day. 
“If inspiration hits them at 2 a.m. and they want to go paint, they certainly can go and do that,” Martin said.
Still, students have not been granted this privilege just yet. To gain swipe access to the room, undergraduates must first contact the Director of Arts Initiatives, Jennette A. Trenchard, about their desire to use it.
“Students will have to email me and let me know their name, their student number, and just let me know that they’re interested in getting access to the room,” Trenchard said. “After that they’ll get an orientation that I’ll set up for them, either with me or the Freshman Arts Board.”
This orientation will cover the basic rules and regulations for using the space, followed with a user participation agreement that the student must sign.
Trenchard said she has worked with the arts board and the FDO to plan various events for this semester, including a Valentine’s Day event and a Mardi Gras celebration.
“We’re very excited about it. I think it’s a great opportunity for students to be able to utilize the space much more freely,” Martin said.
Audrey S. Thorne ’19, a current member of the Freshman Arts Board, said she is looking forward to the coming changes.
“It’s really amazing that we’re finally going to be able to say ‘Anyone who wants to can use art supplies whenever they want,’” Thorne said. “I think that it will definitely become a more lively, fuller space.”

With construction on the Smith Campus Center set to ramp up later this year, Harvard administrative offices and businesses displaced by the renovations have recently moved to new temporary locations.
Significant portions of the Harvard University Health Services have moved from the Smith Center at the end of last October to a new space on the seventh floor of 114 Mount Auburn St., according to Lindsey Baker, a spokesperson for HUHS. The Center for Wellness has also moved to the same building and the HUHS reception desk has relocated to the second floor of the Smith Center.
“It creates a nice space on the seventh floor that’s just for health services and people coming to the Wellness Center,” Baker said.
Director of the Center for Wellness Jeanne M. Mahon said the “new space is quiet with lots of natural light,” adding that the center has created an additional treatment room that has allowed the center to offer new chair massages every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday.
Baker said the Dental Services Offices, located now on the seventh floor of the 114 Mount Auburn St. building, is also undergoing renovations. Once the renovations to the office are complete, the University’s pharmacy will move into the arcade area of the campus center.
The Holyoke Street Garage, located under the Smith Center, will remain fully operational even though construction might force drivers to seek alternate routes to enter the garage, according to the HUHS website.
“[The pharmacy will] be in the sort of same section as the Health Services, so it’ll be nice for picking up your prescriptions after clinical visits,” Baker said.
Harvard’s Student Health Program office, which manages both the student and employee health plan, have also temporarily moved to 16 Dunster St., Baker said. Once the renovations on the first floor of 114 Mount Auburn St. are completed, that office will also move to that building.
Administrative offices are not the only organizations moving from the Smith Center due to the renovations. Businesses that currently reside on the first floor of the Smith Center will be moving to alternate locations. Clover Food Labs will move into a space previously occupied by Yenching on Massachusetts Avenue.
The Harvard Public Affairs and Communications offices have moved to the sixth floor of the 114 Mount Auburn St. building.

More than two months after Latino students voiced a series of demands to Harvard’s central administration, Latino student groups hosted a town hall with a focus on bridging gaps between what students say are partially fragmented student groups.
The town hall on Thursday evening focused on building a coalition for student groups of color, with many students acknowledging that student organizations need to bridge gaps both within and between their constituencies. Many students said they recognized a “divide” between Latino student groups, specifically pointing to a variety of cultural groups.
Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18, a Mather House Undergraduate Council representative, also suggested that student groups representing different races and ethnicities should convene to discuss issues relevant to their respective group.
“Leaders of cultural groups could come together and set up a monthly meeting,” he said.
Ruben Reyes ’19 said increased visibility by College administrators would also go lengths to make students of color feel more comfortable. Several administrators attended Thursday’s town hall, including Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, interim Dean of Student Life Thomas A. Dingman ’67, and Dr. S. Allen Counter, head of the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations.
Thursday’s discussion comes more than two months after a group of Latino students submitted a set of demands to University President Drew G. Faust, many of which—such as a multicultural center and cultural sensitivity trainings for Harvard faculty and staff—students referenced at the town hall. One change, a requested replacement to House masters’ controversial titles, is currently underway.
Students also discussed expanding Latino Studies at Harvard. Currently, undergraduates may obtain a secondary in Latino Studies under the Standing Committee on Ethnicity, Migration, Rights. Gonzalez said he hopes the field will expand into a full concentration.
Town hall attendees also advocated for increased hirings for faculty of color across all departments—an action which a recent diversity report highlighted.
The report, compiled by the College’s working group on diversity and inclusion, calls for a sweeping range of both short-term and long-term reforms, including standardizing diversity practices in Houses and cultural sensitivity training for all Harvard faculty and staff that regularly interact with students.
The meeting ended on an optimistic note: attendees collected a list of action items such as increased mental health resources and diversity trainings for Harvard faculty.
“I definitely see a very vibrant future for the Harvard Latinx community,” Reyes said.

Last spring Divest Harvard—a group of students challenging the University to withdraw its financial investments in fossil fuels—drew headlines for a week-long blockading of Harvard President Drew G. Faust’s Office. But after a quiet fall semester, the group is planning to refocus its efforts towards a less flashy and more targeted approach to achieve its goals.
The semester will be a time for re-strategizing and reevaluating the role Divest plays on Harvard’s campus, according to Naima Drecker-Waxman ’18, a coordinator for Divest. Given the number of  Divest members who have either graduated or will graduate this year, she said the group will emphasize regrouping, institutional memory, and event planning this spring.
“We are at a point in the campaign where it’s been three years since we started,” Drecker-Waxman said. “It’s also a time to really reevaluate the goals of divestment because ultimately divestment is a tactic and the goal is around climate justice.”
Despite the recent lull in action, Divest is planning more events.
Drecker-Waxman said Divest is “definitely coming back in terms of direct action,” although she declined to specify what events the group planned for the coming semester.
In addition to regrouping and focusing on event planning, Divest will pivot its priorities. The group will seek to reflect an expanded understanding of climate change in terms of “centering things like racial and economic justice and organizing around climate change.”
Divest is adding the Spectra pipeline—a natural gas pipeline that runs through much of the Northeast, including Massachusetts—to its list of projects it considers environmentally dangerous. The group plans on hosting educational events about the pipeline and Spectra’s plans for expansion.
The focus on the pipeline is part of the organization’s goal of expanding its activism outside the gates of Harvard, Drecker-Waxman said. While the group won’t abandon their push for tangible change from Harvard, Drecker-Waxman said Divest needs a new approach to working with University administrators.
“What we think immediate action would look like is entering negotiations as opposed to the same meeting that we’ve had 13 times,” said Drecker-Waxman, emphasizing the need to have a “serious conversation” around the next steps.
Alongside Divest’s new strategy for its campus activism, some of its members are also involved in a lawsuit against Harvard.
In late November 2014, the Harvard Climate Justice Coalition, a group of Harvard students including some Divest members, filed a lawsuit against the University for its  financial support of the oil, gas, and coal industries. The lawsuit claims that Harvard intentionally invests in “abnormally dangerous activities.”
The suit was heard in late February, but the judge of the Suffolk Superior Court granted Harvard’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit about a month later. In response, the Coalition appealed and filed an appellate brief in October. The group is currently waiting for a ruling on the appeal.
“We think the trial court made an error dismissing the case,” Joseph “Ted” E. Hamilton, a Law School student and member of the Coalition, said. “We think the judge made some factual conclusions that really should be left to a jury.”
Kelsey C. Skaggs, a Law student and Coalition member, said the group’s appeal is currently pending before the Massachusetts Appeals Court. The group expects the court to assign the lawsuit a hearing date in the coming months.
If the courts do not grant an appeal, Hamilton said the group would likely appeal once more to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Crimson fans can add another color to their wardrobe.
As of a few weeks ago, the Cleveland Browns have emerged as a possible darling of the student body, filling their front office with a selection of Harvard graduates. Sashi Brown, Paul DePodesta, and Andrew Berry compose what is likely the most intriguing management in professional football—and, perhaps, a new bandwagon team for Crimson fans.
Admittedly, yes, these are the same Cleveland Browns who ended the season with a 3-13 record, marking the fifth-consecutive year with a last-place finish in the AFC North. Yes, these are the Browns who haven’t made the playoffs since 2002—who haven’t won a championship since 1964 or ever, depending on your definition of championship (the first Super Bowl took place in 1967.)
But Crimson supporters have good reason to pay attention to a Browns organization that is suddenly dominated by Harvard degrees.
First, on January 3, it was Sashi Brown. A graduate of the Law School, the 39-year-old Brown was promoted from his role as general counsel to become vice president of football operations. In this capacity, he will have final say over personnel decisions, including whom to draft and include on the 53-man roster.
Three days later, the Browns sent ripples across the sports world by snatching up Paul DePodesta as their chief strategy officer.
Previously DePodesta had served as the vice president of scouting and player development for baseball’s New York Mets, helping the organization to its first World Series appearance in 15 years.
More previously he had worked for the Oakland Athletics and advised general manager Billy Beane on the importance of analytics. This sabremetric revolution was dramatized in Moneyball; Jonah Hill played DePodesta.
But even more previously, DePodesta attended Harvard. He had played both football and baseball, lived in Cabot House, and graduated in 1995 with a degree in Economics.
With the Browns, he will hold a flexible management role, promoting analytic efforts and confronting any organizational inefficiencies.
The Harvard-heavy front office was completed on Wednesday when the Browns announced the hiring of Andrew Berry as the vice president of player personnel.
Not to be confused with Professor Andrew Berry, a specialist of evolutionary biology at the College, this 28-year-old Berry graduated from Harvard in 2009 with a simultaneous bachelor’s degree in economics and master’s degree in computer science.
By that point, he had also compiled an impressive resume on the gridiron, starting for four years as a cornerback and earning a slew of awards: All-Ivy team three times and All-American twice.
Although he had hopes of playing for an NFL team, a herniated disk in his back curtailed that ambition. Instead he transitioned to a staff role, reportedly turning down an offer from Goldman Sachs to accept a scouting job with the Indianapolis Colts.
Less than a decade later, he has arrived in Ohio as one of the youngest executives in the league.
The Crimson trio of Brown, DePodesta, and Berry offers an unusual combination as the Browns look to recuperate from their three-win campaign. Joining the Harvard brain trust will be a new coach: Hue Jackson, previously the offensive coordinator with the Cincinnati Bengals.
Jackson has developed a reputation as a more traditional leader—someone who interacts well with players and values in-game instincts. It remains to be seen whether this classic approach can thrive alongside the rigorous statistics of DePodesta and company.
At least for now, though, there has hardly been a better chance to strut around campus wearing a Browns jersey. What strange times we live in.

The last time the Harvard men’s basketball team entered the Palestra, it was in a much different place.
Facing Yale in a one-game playoff to claim a spot in the NCAA tournament, the Crimson played to a 51-51 tie. Then, with nine seconds remaining, Steve Moundou-Missi ’15 received a pass from Wesley Saunders ’15 and scored a mid-range jumper for the win, sending Harvard dancing for the fourth straight season.
This year, however, the Crimson returns to the Palestra with the situation turned on its head. Heading into back-to-back contests against Princeton (12-5, 2-1 Ivy League) and Penn (6-11, 0-3), Harvard (9-11, 1-3) is scraping just to get to .500.
The Crimson will look to bounce back after falling last Friday to Cornell and last Saturday to Columbia, on a buzzer beater by the Lions’ Alex Rosenberg. Last weekend marked the first time that Harvard had been swept in an Ivy home weekend since 2009.
“Coach always says the only thing better than winning a conference game is winning a conference game on the road,” senior Patrick Steeves said. “So I think two big wins against two good teams would be huge for us.
The last time the Crimson faced Penn at the Palestra, the team limited the Quakers (6-11, 0-3) to just 38 points. Among Ivy League teams, Penn is unique in at least two ways: it is the only team without a conference win and the only team without a player in the top 10 of league scoring.
Despite failing to put a mark in the win column through three conference games, the Quakers are not a team that can be counted as an automatic win. In its Ivy opener, Penn forced Princeton into overtime before eventually falling by two.
One area in which Harvard has struggled mightily, especially in Ivy League play, is foul shooting. In conference play, the Crimson shoots 46.6 percent from the charity stripe; overall this rate is 57.8 percent.
Nationwide the next worst team, University of Arkansas-Pine Bluff, shoots over two percentage points higher—and has a 5-18 record.
What started as a problem limited to frontcourt players like junior Zena Edosomwan and sophomore Chris Egi (46.3 percent combined) has spread throughout the roster. Down the stretch last weekend, both Steeves and junior Corbin Miller missed key free throws against Columbia.
To get to Philadelphia, however, the team will need to go through Princeton, one of three teams picked above Harvard in the preseason media poll.
The programs present a conflict of styles, as the Tigers enter the game with the second-highest scoring offense in the Ancient Eight at 77.0 points per game, while the Crimson boasts the second-best scoring defense, allowing 66.3 points per game.
“We really have to do a good job defending the lines, meaning defending the three point line, and not fouling them and letting them get to the foul line,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.
A good defensive game will start with limiting junior Henry Caruso, the third-leading scorer in the Ancient Eight at 16.6 points per game. Senior forward Agunwa Okolie, the team’s best perimeter defender, will likely be tasked with guarding Caruso.
However, the Okolie-Caruso matchup alone will not determine the contest. It will take a complete effort from the Crimson, who did not put together consecutive quality halves last weekend, to come out with a win.
Twice in three conference losses, Harvard has seen a double-digit lead disappear. In the other, it fought back from a 15-point halftime deficit, only to give back the lead with a poor closing stretch.
In that game, against the Big Red, the starting rotation of Okolie, Cummins, Edosomwan, and freshmen Corey Johnson and Tommy McCarthy used less than eight minutes to even the score, but when Amaker went to the bench to give the starters a rest, the progress slowed significantly. Not a single bench player scored a point.
“We ask a lot of our starters,” said Steeves, the team’s highest-scoring reserve. “Guys like Zena have been having breakout seasons and defenses are focusing on them and so I think just for [the bench] to be able to get in there and kind of take some pressure off maybe is something we need to do a better job of this weekend.”
Though the Crimson is on the outside looking in at the top of the Ancient Eight, the round-robin nature of the 14-game conference season means that any team can compete with any opponent on a given night.
“The league is really crazy, so the worst thing you can do is not be prepared for a game on any given night,” Okolie said. “[We’re] focusing on ways to win games this weekend, and hopefully things will work out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It will be a clash of the titans this weekend at Lavietes Pavilion as the Harvard women’s basketball team (8-9, 3-1 Ivy) takes on Penn and Princeton, the two teams sandwiching the Crimson in the Ivy League standings.
In a series of games that will go a long way in deciding the recipient of the Ancient Eight’s automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament, Harvard faces the Quakers (14-3, 3-0) on Friday night before welcoming the Tigers (13-4, 2-1) for a Sunday matinee. The “Killer P’s,” as the Crimson’s upcoming opponents are known, have combined to win each of the last six Ivy titles.
“I think that every game is important in the Ivy League season,” senior guard Shilpa Tummala said. “It’s a 14-game tournament, so we have to be worried about everyone…. We’re going into this game knowing they’re good teams but preparing the same as we would for every game in the Ivy League.”
Two wins this weekend would see Harvard climb past Penn, currently top in the conference, and into first place. The only conference loss suffered by either opponent came during Princeton’s trip to Philadelphia earlier this month.
“Because they’ve both won titles in the recent past, that’s what makes them everyone’s target,” Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “We’ve done well, but we haven’t ended up with wins. We’re still so young that we’re just putting it together, and I think it’s coming together for us right now.”
The Quakers, who have won the last four meetings against Harvard, feature a pair of skyscrapers down low. Forwards Sydney Stipanovich and Michelle Nwokedi are both 6’3,” and they lead the team in scoring and rebounding, individually averaging 14-plus points and 10-plus rebounds per game.
“We will have to focus on team defense and realizing that they have a really good interior game…. Our guards are going to have to step up,” Tummala said. “The way we’re going to win is to play as a team and have that pack mentality on defense.”
Penn also figures to maintain its half court press and two-three zone that have held opponents to a conference-low 52.2 points per game this year. For Tummala and the Crimson, the focus will be on beating the press and hitting its outside shots.
While the Quakers’ paint presence will make things difficult for Harvard’s leading scorer—captain AnnMarie Healy, averaging 15.6 points per game—the team’s three-point specialists, notably Tummala and captain Kit Metoyer, will get chances to score.
“Penn has a system that’s terrific,” Delaney-Smith said. “[Coach Mike McLaughlin] has a nice team, and he has great height. But his system uses that height really well. They just play a 2-3 zone and slow the game down with a half court press, and that just works perfectly with their personnel.”
The Crimson will be off Saturday before taking on the Tigers the next day. Princeton, which went 30-0 in the regular season last year on its way to a fifth Ivy League title in six years, is undefeated at home but just 2-4 on the road this season.
“I love playing at home,” Tummala said. “There’s always an advantage to being home. It’s really nice to have this weekend be at home first and have a feel for it: our rims, our gym, our locker room, our fans. It’s going to be a great environment for us to play in.”
The top four scorers for Princeton are all seniors, with guard Michelle Miller, guard/forward Annie Tarakchian, and forward Alex Wheatley all averaging double figures. Miller, who leads the Tigers with 13.8 points per game, shoots 45.5 percent from the field and 38.8 percent from beyond the arc.
Princeton has also benefitted from dominance on the glass, with Tarakchian’s 9.5 rebounds per game allowing the team to outrebound opponents by 15 boards a contest.
“Our thing goes back to sticking to what we do best,” Tummala said. “That’s hitting our open shots, passing the ball, moving the ball inside, and really setting the tempo of the game however we need to. I think our identity really lies in our defense, and if we stick to our defensive principles, offensively everything will come as it should.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The king is dead, and his prince is in charge.
The first back-to-back weekend of Ivy League play was as much confirmation as coronation. Harvard, which now ranks last in all of Division I in free throw percentage, stumbled to two home losses in eminently winnable contests against the Gentleman’s C’s, the last a buzzer-beater from Columbia senior Alex Rosenberg after Harvard missed consecutive free throws down the stretch with an opportunity to put the Lions away.
If inconsistency was the story of Harvard’s weekend, dominance was the tale for the Bulldogs. After jumping all over the Quakers on Friday, Yale raced out to a double-digit lead against Princeton at home and held off the tricky Tigers down the stretch. With co-leader Columbia coming to town this weekend, the Bulldogs have a good shot to put distance between themselves and the field. Since Yale plays six of its last eight games on the road, it will need that cushion.
Princeton, whose multifaceted group of wings has given everyone trouble so far, lurks as a dark horse. The Tigers have a rough two-game stretch at Columbia and versus Yale in mid-February but a manageable schedule bracketing those contests. Forward Henry Caruso, the Ivy League’s third-leading scorer, has emerged to supplement a bevy of outside threats who all shoot well from distance and drive the line. Were it not for the disappointing early returns on Spencer Cook’s season (39.3 percent from the field, 30.2 percent from three), this team might easily be the favorite.
The existence of a clear top three muddles the picture for the league’s middle class. Even without Robert Hatter, Cornell pulled off an improbable sweep last weekend behind career nights from freshman Matt Morgan. After an electric win over Harvard, Dartmouth has shifted down from turbocharge to neutral.
And then there is Harvard. With a bit better free throw shooting—and a healthier Zena Edosomwan—the Crimson might easily be 3-1 and on the heels of a Yale team that visits Cambridge last weekend. As Amaker told The Daily Pennsylvanian this week, “If we shoot free throws better.... I think the narrative of this team is different.”
Yet free throws aren’t Harvard’s only issue. Since nearly defeating No. 7 Kansas in December, Harvard has had leads in every second half—including against No. 1 Oklahoma—but an inability to stop opponent momentum has doomed them. Too often one basket has become three. Columbia ran off a 16-4 run in the second half against Harvard, nearly matching Dartmouth’s 27-6 spurt and Oklahoma’s 27-2 stretch.
With January lineups that alternatively missed Edosomwan, freshman Corey Johnson, and senior Patrick Steeves, Harvard has been unable to maintain its rhythm. For a team that boasts the best win of any Ivy (BYU) and three close losses to top-15 teams, the slow start is especially frustrating. Its reward—a trip to a stadium where it has won just twice in 27 years—is hardly consolation.
Yet, Harvard has no choice but to find that form again; while it may already be out of the Ivy League title race, another loss or two would seal the coffin door.
On to the picks.
COLUMBIA AT YALE
The league’s only two undefeated teams tip off the weekend at Payne Whitney, where the Bulldogs boast an 8-0 home record. Yale has been the more dominant team through four games, but Columbia boasts three of the conference’s four most valuable players by Basketball-Reference’s Win Shares metric. The Lions come in as confident as ever after coach Kyle Smith’s first-ever win in Lavietes, arguably the league’s hardest place to play.
Yale can comfort itself in centuries of history, however. It was Yale graduates, after all, who founded King’s College, Columbia’s precursor, in the 1750s. The cause was alarm about the College of New Jersey, now Princeton—the first of many places (Toad’s being the most recent) to cause Yale to question its intellectualism. After King’s College closed during the Revolutionary War, its Loyalist alumni fled, and in the aftermath came the architects of what may be Division I’s worst football team.
Two and a half centuries later, I’m feeling confident picking against the Torys in this one.
Pick: Yale
DARTMOUTH AT PENN
Watching Penn throw up an oh-fer on the Brown-Yale road trip last weekend, I couldn’t help but think about when the Quakers were good at sports. Like the time The New York World-Telegram reported an Ivy League conspiracy to stop playing Penn in football because the Quakers had scheduled Notre Dame. The reason? By playing Notre Dame, Penn would be “condoning” the decadent academic policies of the South Bend institution.
Oh Howard, I do wonder how they might descend from that high horse.
Pick: Dartmouth
CORNELL AT BROWN
By beating Penn, Brown no longer carries the distinction of the league’s only team without a victory. With power forward Cedric Kuakamensah carrying a 9.4 percent block percentage and Steven Spieth distributing and scoring well at the point, the Bears have some interesting pieces. They haven’t yet come together, but on a campus where the football team’s “timeless rivalry” is with URI, I think you’re granted a bit of a longer time horizon to figure things out.
Pick: Cornell
HARVARD AT PRINCETON
From here on out, it appears that every game will be a must-win for the 1-3 Crimson. No team has won the league with a record of 11-3 since Harvard did it three years ago, and even that team shot out of the gates before needing a Princeton collapse on the final weekend. The Crimson has won twice straight at Jadwin after a quarter-century of futility that culminated in an HSAC piece proving the home advantage the Tigers get from Jadwin’s strange lighting backdrop.
Were Charles Eliot, the Harvard president who labeled the curveball as deceptive and thus “not an ability we should want to foster at Harvard," still alive, I daresay he might shoot out that darned backdrop.
Pick: Princeton
CORNELL AT YALE
Matt Morgan could score 50, and I don’t think it’ll matter.
Pick: Yale
COLUMBIA AT BROWN
After an interlude of unbiased news coverage, The Daily Spectator has returned to form. Consistent readers of this column may recall famous columns comparing Lions games to the Super Bowl, celebrating December wins in March, and likening Hanover to a “scene from The Shining.” Daniel Radov is back to make his place in history, calling Alex Rosenberg’s buzzer-beater last Saturday his second “game-winning” shot in three years.
Problem is that the shot Radov refers to was waived off for a foul about which Lions fans are still salty. I’d liken christening it a “game-winner” to calling Justin Bieber a “family figure” or labeling Qdoba a “burrito chain.” Try as hard as we might to imagine that reality, it just ain’t here.
Pick: Brown
DARTMOUTH AT PRINCETON
After seemingly turning the corner against Harvard, the Big Green took a step back last weekend with a sweep at the hands of the Gentleman’s C’s. Against a Tigers team that can’t afford many missteps with the way the Lions and Bulldogs are playing, that’s a recipe for disaster.
Pick: Princeton
HARVARD AT PENN
It is hard to square the sedate basketball rivalry between these two schools with its electric football history. Penn nearly took away Harvard’s undefeated season a year ago before completing the feat last year, nicely priming the Crimson for a ninth consecutive beatdown of Yale.
It was the fourth consecutive year the game had title implications, something that can scarcely be said for the teams’ encounters on the hardwood. Since Zach Rosen patrolled the floor, Penn has routinely been at the bottom of the conference. Firing Jerome Allen last year was a first step, but outside of an overtime effort against Princeton, Penn has looked poor in Ivy League play. Senior Darien-Nelson Henry has steadily become one of the best rebounding big men in the league, but his advanced defensive stats lag behind his impressive box score statistics. Sophomore Sam Jones has stepped up, but he and classmate Antonio Woods are not at the same level as the conference’s best backcourts (Yale, Princeton, Cornell).
It says here this game will be closer than last year, but don’t expect Harvard to bow out easily.
Pick: Harvard

As much as HUDS has stepped up their salad and website game this past year, eating in the dining hall still feels like a chore. Doubly so if you're in Adams, where recently a putrid stench has invaded the dining hall and residents have been forced to use plastic plates. However, there once was a time not too long ago when HUDS was the last word in fine dining.
Take a look at this menu from a Tuesday in 1909. Currently stored at the Harvard University Archives in Pusey Library, this menu (1) is  beautiful and (2) should make modern Harvard feel ashamed of itself. The menu was displayed alongside an essay written by Henry David Thoreau when he was a student at the College, to show what the author ate the day he published his essay. But really, we at Flyby think it's there to send a messages to modern-day Dining Services: This could be us, HUDS, but you playin'.
When was the last time you had broiled halibut (a fish, I had to look that up) or broiled lamb chops for breakfast? I had a boiled egg for breakfast today.
Or a cut of (real) veal for lunch and a melba tart for dessert? Adams had chicken fingers at lunch today.
How about roast lamb, fried scallops, and a fig cake for dinner?
All of this makes us wonder: what happened? Harvard tuition costs somewhere around $63,000 per year. Are we really getting our money's worth? Oh, how the mighty have fallen.

It’s no secret that this season’s presidential campaign is one of the most entertaining (if not terrifying) yet. Watching the presidential debates makes one thing tremendously obvious: comedy writers will have prime material for the rest of the campaign season, and possibly until the end of time. We’ve all seen Tina Fey’s Sarah Palin and Kate McKinnon’s Hillary Clinton, and maybe even dream of being on SNL (don’t worry, you don’t have to comp any semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine to do so, even if their comp materials may lead you to believe so). If you’re looking for an easier way to emulate the greats of this election season, here are a couple tips:
Bernie Sanders
Aside from the endless tirades against Wall Street and the “big banks,” the name of Bernie Sander’s game is waving your arms around like a madman, and shouting like one too. When in doubt, act like you’re trying to get the attention of your friend from across Mass Ave while they have headphones in (jumping is also encouraged). While you’re shouting about Wall Street (ignore the fact that you sent your resume to Goldman Sachs in a fit of desperation over winter break) throw in the word “establishment” and the phrase “political revolution” a couple of times and you’re all set for a spot-on impression.
Hillary Clinton
Say what you want: she is the queen of shade. Hillary’s mastered a suave, quiet way of telling people to sod off. Look at the snapshots of her in the Benghazi hearings, or stills of her face just before she rips into Republicans or Bernie Sanders, and take tips. Or maybe go in the obvious direction and try out her perfectly-rehearsed chuckle and her internal dialogue about being president. Whatever you do, don’t forget the iconic haircut and pantsuit.
Ted Cruz
Make sure you memorize your bible verses and bring a note card full of jibes at the media wherever you go. Also, it’s probably a good idea to learn how to stare into the deepest recess of someone’s soul. Cruz has proven at every Republican debate that he’s the king of awkward eye contact. And awkward interactions. And, just being generally awkward.
Donald Trump
Let’s face it, if you can’t make a Trump impression funny then the stage is not for you. Whatever angle you end up tackling this from, It’s going to be “huuuuuuge.” I’m not quite sure where the nearest wig store in Cambridge is, but if you’re that pressed to emulate Trump, I’m sure you can find a few hairballs in the corner of your dorm room and some yellow paint from the Freshman Art’s Room. Finally, enroll in the new EXPOS 40: Bold, Brazen and Bullheaded, a Public Speaking Practicum.
Marco Rubio
Boots! Seriously, ditch the “buttas” and combat boots and get yourself a pair of whatever Rubio was wearing on the campaign trail. And while you’re at it, it’s time to put those public speaking courses that you took in high school to the test. Stand in front of the mirror, lace your bootstraps up and recite your most patriotic speech, while nervously chugging water every few minutes. Just be sure not to accidentally flip flop; Fox News will be sure to catch it on tape.
Ben Carson
Honestly, all you need to do to be Ben Carson is just chill out—and if you hit up your stoner blockmate to do so, we aren’t going to judge you. Just sit in the back of your section with a muted smile and never raise your voice above a murmur. Always look very pleased with yourself. If you can spare the cash, maybe also commission an oil portrait of you and Jesus to hang in your dorm room.

At the end of the day, we should all be grateful to have such a cast of characters running for President. Good to know we’ll be in excellent hands for the next four years.

Every snow storm in Cambridge brings with it a host of goodies including cancelled classes, warm cocoa, and transportation nightmares. MBTA passengers, especially those who ride the T’s Red Line, are no strangers to delays and bus substitutes. So why did I think today would be any different? Today, I was trapped on the Red Line for a half-hour long trip from Kendall Square to Harvard Square (that's two stops, for those of you who are counting). Here’s a minute-by-minute recap of my latest transportation woes:
12:31 p.m.: After finishing up with a meeting in Kendall Square, I arrive back at the Kendall/MIT station for a smooth quick ride back to Harvard. It only took 8 minutes earlier in the morning. What could possibly go wrong?
12:34 p.m.: My train arrives and I board. The conductor makes an announcement that a track issue near Harvard Station will delay the train. No problem, so long as everyone’s safe.
12:41 p.m.: The train still hasn’t left the station. I check Twitter to find the Cambridge Fire Department report a fire around Harvard Station. I didn’t realize the Lowell dining hall had relocated.
12:44 p.m.: We’ve moved a bit but we’re stopped in the tunnel somewhere between Kendall and Central. I start to regret not packing snacks.
12:45 p.m.: The man sitting across the train from me begins making phone calls and complaining that he shouldn’t have left work so early. I make a mental note that any and all future jobs of mine must offer the flexibility to phone it in on snowy Fridays.
12:48 p.m.: We’re moving again. HUDS chicken strips are calling my name.
12:53 p.m.: We’re stopped again, just past Central. I’m reminded of my Shuttle Ride of Doom and inspired to share my latest transportation woes with Flyby's loyal readers.
1:01 p.m.: Finally back to Cambridge. It’s not snowing as much anymore. How long was I trapped underground anyway?
