After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What does a squirrel holding a grenade have in common with a beautiful, seashell-shaped agate teapot? Both are subjects of ceramic pieces crafted by Michelle Erickson, a renowned artist whose work combines historical ceramic techniques with modern themes.
While most of her work is original, Erickson has over 20 years of experience working with 17th- and 18th-century reproduction pottery. Her reproductions and contemporary pieces have won critical acclaim across the globe. Erickson, who recently returned from a three-month artist residency at The Victoria and Albert Museum in London, will be teaching a Visiting Artist Workshop through the Office of Fine Arts at Harvard  on Feb 28.
The Harvard Crimson: How would you describe your style of ceramic work?
Michelle Erickson: I use a lot of…references from ceramic history—both lost ceramic arts that have been rediscovered and techniques I looked into, and also the context of that history, of the social or political or environmental context of that history [as a way] to describe 21st century issues. So, I would say my work is narrative. It uses history as a way of looking at our present human condition.
THC: You are known for your work with both recreations of older pottery styles and contemporary pieces. How are the two creative processes different, and which do you find more rewarding?
ME: For me, the two processes are totally integrated, so I don’t make that distinction. A lot of the work that I do in recreating is trying to rediscover a technique that was used to originally make a piece...and then I tend to use a lot of those techniques sometimes in a very different way in my contemporary work than in the recreated object.… Both processes are so integrated into each other.
THC: You’ve worked with a variety of different historical ceramic traditions during the course of your career. Do you have a favorite?
ME: I think one of my favorite types of ceramic techniques to work in is slipware, which is almost the antithesis of the blue and white pottery tradition...it manipulates liquid clays in different ways. Slipware is sort of one end of the spectrum and blue and white porcelain is the other, and I really like both of those two extremes.
THC: You do a lot of work with clays you find yourself instead of simply buying commercial clay. How does that play into your work?
ME: I certainly do use commercial clays, but I can’t just use any clay for a lot of the things that I do. I really have to find the right clays. I like to get clays right from the ground and use them in different ways, and sometimes they are very unusable. They’re not necessarily predictable or dependable, and they might not do the kind of things you want them to. But I find that I like to have the material and the symbolism of clays from different areas.... I don’t really have an agenda with indigenous clays: I just like to explore them and see where they lead.
THC: What do you hope to gain from the experience of teaching a workshop at Harvard?
ME: I always learn when I’m trying to teach or illustrate things that have become kind of second nature to my own practice. When you have to get outside of yourself and bring that material to an audience who may or may not have any knowledge of it, it really forces you to look at and describe your work in ways that you may not do when you’re just working on your own.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s not everyday that an opera company turns 75. In fact, there is only one such group in New England that can boast such a lengthy continuous run: the Lowell House Opera. This group, which mixes Harvard students with professional performers and a production team from the Cambridge and Boston communities, has been performing in the Lowell House dining hall since 1938.
“Working with LHO is very difficult and exciting because it’s totally different from what goes on in the rest of the theater community at Harvard. You’re working in a company that has a history and a future, and you’re working with donors and alumni,” says student producer Nicholas T Rinehart ’14, a Crimson arts editor.
There is a definite sense of professionalism at the Lowell House Opera, created by the integration of the larger arts community into the performing company, says LHO alumn Anh M. Le ’12. “It’s a place where students learn from professionals, and there’s really a professional aspect to it,” she says. “We bring in outside singers, outside instrumentalists; we really try to utilize the amazing talent that is in the larger Boston region.” The company has throughout its history synthesized the talents from both inside and outside the Harvard gates, but recently there has been a push to encourage even more student involvement. One aspect of this push was the creation of a new student production fellowship—Rinehart now holds this position.
In this capacity, he has already started revamping the company in honor of its 75th anniversary by initiating the creation of a new website and logo. “I’ve taken it upon myself to totally rebrand the company,” he says. This year will also mark the start of the James Laurence Michel Memorial Lecture Series, named after the late Dr. James L. Michel ’76, a longtime supporter of the LHO. These lectures will feature members of the Boston community, like Harvard music professor Carolyn Abbate and various graduate students at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
The 75th season has a certain air of innovation, but in a house full of traditions, many aspects remain the same. Perhaps the greatest point of consistency over the 75 years has been the unique and challenging performance venue. “A giant chandelier is a part of your stage no matter what, and it may make sense for the opening act of “La Traviata,” but there aren’t many of other operas where a giant chandelier remains on the stage for the entire production,” LHO stage director Roxanna K. Myhrum ’05 says. “It’s funny to think of generations of other people being like, ‘All right, how do I do “Turandot” with a giant chandelier? How do I stage “Madame Butterfly” and “Candide”?’…. That chandelier exists through time for everyone.”
While performing in a dining hall has its setbacks, it’s the opera’s connection to Lowell House that music director Lidiya V. Yankovskaya believes has allowed the opera to perform continuously for so long. “The people who have been in charge of Lowell House through these years…have been so supportive of the opera and have recognized what an important part the opera is not only of the Lowell and the Harvard community, but of the Boston community as a whole,” she says.
And the Lowell House Opera has contributed to the community—not simply through its performances, but also by exposing its members to the world of theater. “When I came into Harvard freshman year, I just really liked listening to opera… I knew nothing about theater,” says Le,  who is now a student at the Yale School of Drama. “It was really because of Lowell House Opera that I now have this professional goal and have this kind of career dream, so it’s been a huge impact on my life.” She is studying theater management with the goal of becoming an opera producer and is only one of many alums who have pursued a career in the opera community.  Along with its other accomplishments, Lowell House Opera can celebrate inspiring its members, another tradition that the historic company plans to continue for many years to come.

For a first-time visitor to Harvard, it is a bit of a shock to see to a concrete, spaceship-like building wedged between the traditional Barker Center and Fogg Museum. The Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, now celebrating its 50th anniversary, might be a disappointment—at least a surprise—for those who think that “Harvard” and “red brick” are synonymous. As Harvard’s stronghold for artistic experimentation and innovation since 1963, the Carpenter Center still carries out its mission of helping to reconcile Harvard and artistic modernity—most recently, through its new exhibition “Brute,” which is on display in the Carpenter Center through April 7.
Harvard is fortunate to have the Carpenter Center, modernist architect Le Corbusier’s only building in North America, on its campus. To celebrate the building’s half-century-long presence at Harvard, visual and environmental studies faculty members Katarina Burin and Amie Siegel have devised “Brute.” They have called upon a select group of internationally acclaimed artists, namely Nairy Baghramian, Anna Barriball, Barbara Bloom, and Alexandra Leykauf, to join them in responding to the architecture of Carpenter Center and Le Corbusier’s artistic legacy.
What brings together all the artists featured in “Brute” is, in Burin’s words, an interest in the reflection of space in architecture. “Brute” aims to reactivate the whole building, not simply the parts of it normally used for exhibition, as a site of display by means of a mélange of the factual and fictional.
To this end, one of the most intriguing components of “Brute” is its fabricated double, an imaginary exhibit only present in model form in the Main Gallery. The models show loans that were never actually made from the Harvard Art Museums collections, ranging from Josef Albers’s “square” paintings to a Jean Prouvé “chaise-longue,” on display on all five floors of the Carpenter Center. A perceptive visitor might note that only these “borrowed” works, and none physically present in the exhibit, are featured with photographs in the exhibition brochure; others might enthusiastically venture out to climb three flights of stairs in expectation of seeing a Trockel porcelain sculpture strangely exhibited next to a fragment of concrete from Chur, Switzerland, dated 200 B.C.E.-300 C.E., only to realize that the models are, in fact, fictional.
In her contributions to the exhibition Katarina Burin emphasizes the presence of the modernist architectural and design heritage of Cambridge. Her displays and installations of documents and artifacts concentrate on the lives of architect-designers Fran Hosken, Eleanor Raymond, and Petra Andrejova-Molnár—the first two of whom received their design education in the Boston area, and the last of whom is entirely fabricated.
Among more direct responses to the architecture of the Carpenter Center are the works of Alexandra Leykauf and those of Anna Barriball. Professing an interest in the building’s mixture of serial production and organic forms, Leykauf considers space to be more than a medium. She has been inspired by the “ondulatoires” (undulating glass surfaces) of the second-floor studios to create “Untitled (open book),” an enlarged black and white photograph of an open book mounted on a convex wood screen. Seen from afar, “Untitled (open book)” deceives the eye and makes it seem as if the gigantic book is physically present, suggesting a depth and an irregular rhythm that echoes Le Corbusier’s “ondulatoires.”
Anna Barriball’s video pieces negotiate space through the juxtaposition of representations of surfaces in photographic form. In “Screen (night photographs),” she loops the negatives of the photographs she has taken of every single window of the Carpenter Center from outside at night. Taken with a digital auto-focus flash camera, these photographs are almost aleatory shots of shining metal details or exit signs of the building. Along with her “Untitled,” a set of leaves cut out of curtain fabric scattered on the floor in the Main Gallery for the opening reception and subsequently removed, “Screen (night photographs)” simulates one’s consciousness while walking: Barriball calls the infinitesimal blackout between two photographs a “blink” between two locations.
Whether or not she specifically addresses the Carpenter Center itself, each artist builds upon her reaction to the revolutionary aesthetic ideals of its architect. Siegel, whose film “Provenance” focuses on the circulation of Brutalist furniture from auction houses to a luxurious yacht, Parisian apartments, and a Punjabi library, succinctly replies with a smile on her face when asked about what the exhibition is really about. “‘Brute’ is the performance of a place,” she says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This year’s Oscar nominees are a controversial bunch, to say the least. “Zero Dark Thirty” prompted Congressional hearings about its depiction of torture; “Django Unchained” was certainly racially charged; and “Argo” fell victim to a much-discussed snub in the Best Director category.
Then there’s “Les Misérables.” The controversy there can be boiled down to one word: really?
An incredible amount of hay has been made as to whether “Les Misérables” deserves to be in competition for the lofty prize. First came glowing early reviews and predictions of Oscar gold that propelled the film forward, followed soon after by a major backlash. But the third and current phase has been somewhat unique, not only in character but in duration. Negative reviews of highly anticipated films inevitably evoke ire from fans, but rarely is the reaction so sustained—or so ad hominem towards dissenters. I have yet to see a justification of the film that actually argues for the movie’s merits; instead, the film’s defenders assert that those who dislike the movie are predisposed against it and are nitpicking problems just to be contradictory or, worse, to ruin the experience for those who did enjoy it.
This defense has yet to rest. On Jan. 28, New York Times critic Stanley Fish published a piece entitled “Les Misérables’ and Irony,” in which he declares that those who “trash” the film do so out of fear that applauding its unironic assault on the senses means being labeled a “bourgeois cheerleader.” Fish argues that critics who dislike the material or find director Tom Hooper’s in-your-face directorial style don’t appreciate the raw, unaffected emotions Hooper strives to create. The movie, Fish says, aims to disarm viewers of their ability to detach from the characters and “leaves critics with nothing to do except join the rhythms of rapt silence, crying and applause, and it is understandable that they want nothing to do with it.”
The flaw in this argument is that it is simply wrong. Rebuttals like Fish’s do nothing to debunk the criticisms of the film; claiming admiration of a movie solely for its director’s intentions ignores the multitude of problems that can arise in execution. It’s Hooper’s penchant for extreme close-ups and not his goal that has drawn so much ire. Few would argue that a bomb like “Movie 43” deserves praise just for trying to be funny, so why do proponents of “Les Misérables” claim the film’s intentions override its many blemishes?
Besides, talking about claustrophobia-inducing camera work and sappy material, as most of the film’s critics do, certainly isn’t nitpicking; it’s calling out factors perceived as major, in many ways damning, flaws. I have personally been very vocal about my negative feelings towards the film, most of which stem from the cinematography and performances. If I were to instead point out such mistakes as the presence of a modern-looking Santa Claus in the 1840s when his current depiction wasn’t codified until the 1930s, that would indeed warrant a severe finger-wagging. But I haven’t seen a single review that mentions this mistake, and indeed I only bring it up here to illustrate what could reasonably be described as an overly specific criticism.
More problematically, fans of the film outright disparage the intentions of moviegoers and critics who don’t enjoy the film. I have watched movies for the sole purpose of mockery, films including such “gems” as “The Star Wars Holiday Special.” But aside from such legendarily bad movies, I watch films with the sincere intention of enjoying them, even when I plan on writing a review or analysis. To argue that critics walk into a theater hoping to feel nothing for two or more hours is to suggest that they have a decidedly masochistic approach to their job.
A critic of any medium who only recommends works from which he felt fully detached does a disservice to his audience, and I have never seen a piece of criticism reflecting this predilection. The job by necessity requires a willingness to submit to emotional experiences for the sake of better being able to convey to readers a piece’s flaws or merits. And yet, proponents of “Les Misérables” ascribe detachment—even outright malice towards tear-jerking cinema—to those who scorn this particular adaptation, even when the same critics frequently praise other movies precisely for their emotional heft.
Most pressing is that this head-in-the-sand approach of deriding a film’s detractors undermines the very foundation of the critical community, the reason for existence of which is to engender thoughtful discussion and analysis of a work. Negative responses deserve to be entertained, even if only so that they may be disproved; very few films deserve to be considered entirely unimpeachable. I’m more than happy to hear out your praise; all I ask in return is my right to disagree.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Kafka’s “The Metamorphosis,” a salesman named Gregor Samsa finds himself transformed into a giant beetle. The human-turned-arthropod despairs at his inability to leave bed for work, and he struggles to master his new physique. Though Gregor’s family is dismayed by the event, his parents submit to their son’s fate. Rather than seek a cure for Gregor or wonder at the root of his metamorphosis, they handle the beetle at a distance, doling out empathy until their disbelief turns to anger. Eventually, Gregor’s disgusted father beats back the roaming insect with apples—one of which remains painfully lodged inside Gregor’s shell. By the end of the story, Gregor’s beloved sister insists that the family purge the beetle from their home.
Reading “The Metamorphosis” this summer was my first encounter with Kafka. I was subletting an apartment from a couple who had “The Metamorphosis” on their bookshelf, and I pulled out the novella on a weeknight when the New York humidity left me lazing next to their fan. I was less troubled reading about Gregor’s transformation than about his family’s reaction, which haunted me first in its resignation and then in its cruelty. Why did his parents so helplessly accept their son’s misfortune? How could they not ask questions? Why did their aversion to the beetle override their empathy? I realized that in Kafka’s literary Coliseum—my metaphor for the author’s strange, bleak arena in which surreal events overtake innocent characters—the victim is only half the spectacle. The audience, sitting back and watching the unbelievable unfold, becomes its own unsettling display. I closed the book, but my discomfort lingered.
Later that night, I opened my laptop. My news feed flashed with headlines: “Gunman turns ‘Batman’ screening into real-life ‘horror film.’” “Shooting Rampage at ‘Dark Knight Rises’ Showing in Colorado.” “‘Dark Knight Rises’ shooting ranks among the worst massacres in U.S. history.” I learned that a man named James Holmes had dyed his hair red, claimed to be the Joker, and shot over 60 people in a movie theater screening of “The Dark Knight Rises” at midnight. Dressed in head-to-toe tactical gear, he threw tear gas grenades into the aisles and fired at random as the audience screamed in terror.
Was this reality? I could almost feel Kafka’s Coliseum rising up around Aurora as though summoned from the author’s literary depths. I began to grasp that in our historical moment, a shooter can costume himself as a superhero villain and blast Batman fans with ammunition. The surrealism of the episode sent shudders down my spine. I followed the news as politicians and journalists veered their conversations toward gun control, and I wondered what type of tragic audience we Americans would prove to be.
Kafkaesque events continued to transpire through fall. In October, I watched footage of Hurricane Sandy—the cyclone that meteorologists called “Frankenstorm”—rip front walls from apartment buildings, hurl beach houses into water, repurpose taxis into the likes of yellow minnows, and send 7,000 U.S. citizens into emergency shelters. Barely two months later, I read about the Sandy Hook shootings. First-graders huddled in storage rooms, in bathrooms, and under desks as their friends endured bullets from the murderer’s Bushmaster XM15-E2S rifle. The victims’ bodies were so mutilated that police hesitated to let parents see their shot children.
Each of these incidents left America in shock. It was as if crime and environmental change had morphed into the paranormal. President Obama called for a gun violence task force. New Yorkers debated the prospect of building a sea wall. I started getting daily email requests to sign gun control petitions, and I tracked Facebook updates from volunteers fundraising for hurricane relief.
Through all the chaos, I found myself returning to “The Metamorphosis.” Kafka’s story gave me a touchstone for reflecting on our society’s reaction to these events. Having already thought through the dangers of resignation, I felt proud that so many people were taking action.
At the same time, casting these tragedies in a Kafkaesque light also added nuance to my evaluation. I became more aware of our diverse coping mechanisms. Some of us do resemble Gregor’s family. We turn away from painful situations, accept our powerlessness, or let our resentment grow larger than our will for change. Perhaps these impulses are essentially human. Perhaps they deserve compassion, or perhaps they do not. The question I keep coming back to is: if your child’s life was inexplicably damaged—if he went to the movies and experienced a shooting, or if a storm destroyed his home—how would you try to overcome this fate?

Can you remember the last time somebody trolled you?
If not, perhaps you’re not familiar with the word “troll,” as in the slang verb form “to troll.” This usage derives from another, narrower meaning of “troll” that emerged out of the proliferation of online chat rooms and web forums circa the ’90s, which Wikipedia defines as “Someone who posts inflammatory, extraneous, or off-topic messages in an online community, such as a forum, chat room, or blog, with the primary intent of provoking readers into an emotional response or of otherwise disrupting normal on-topic discussion.”
As with other popular internet slang, trolls and trolling have migrated from the virtual into the real. It’s relatively common to hear of people “getting trolled” in everyday life, which I would define as being deliberately misled and thereby humiliated or made upset. Not all trolling is created equal: most trolling, like slipping a fake anonymous love letter under your roommate’s door on Valentine’s Day, is generally harmless. Other forms of trolling, however, can border on harassment and possibly be subject to legal action.
Although trolling is becoming an increasingly mainstream phenomenon of contemporary youth culture, be apprised that the practice has been around since ancient times. It’s also important to note that being smart isn’t enough to avoid being trolled—even people like Plato got trolled from time to time. Case in point: An apocryphal story goes that Plato once offered Socrates an elegantly concise definition of man as a “featherless biped,” to which Diogenes of Sinope, an essentially homeless philosopher and troll par excellence, replied by offering Plato a de-feathered chicken, i.e., a new member of mankind.
Of the different realms in which the art of trolling takes place, the arts may be most insidiously affected because of how difficult it can be to identify fraudulent artistry—essentially a work of art whose merit is unearned on a formal level, but is still earned through some intentionally deceptive means (like a conceptual artist whose explanations of his or her art are so purposefully dense and opaque that even professional critics would be fooled into thinking that the artist was brilliant) or unintentionally (an artist whose work is created haphazardly and doesn’t reflect technical achievement or conceptual brilliance, but somehow happens to look like it does). For instance, a recent n+1 article explains how the American philosopher Stanley Cavell abandoned a possible career in music after struggling with how to differentiate true art and fraudulent art. (Academia in general is also subject to risk, though—just look up the Sokal Affair). For a mainstream instance of alleged arts trolling, check out “Exit Through the Gift Shop,” a documentary chronicling a French immigrant’s rise to fame as a street artist through clever marketing and publicity—even though the art itself is questionable.
As a student of jazz, I’m intimately familiar with trolling in an art form that has its fair share of trolls. Trolling in jazz is not uncommon: for as long as musicians have been holding open jam sessions, inept musicians have been showing up to the chagrin of other players. In response, the rhythm section, consisting of bass, drums, piano, and guitar in some configuration, might troll these inadequately prepared musicians off the stage by changing the key in which the song is being played. This renders the musical choices of the soloist completely irrelevant and often causes his or her playing to sound extraordinarily dissonant and therefore just plain bad.
Another story I’ve heard involving jazz trolling began with a series of phone calls. A musician thought he’d play a practical joke by calling every bass player he knew and setting them up for what they thought was a real gig. These poor bassists agreed to meet at the place and time designated by their false employer, and at that particular day and time, bystanders were bewildered by the convergence of 30 men lugging double basses into the center of Time Square.
The only thing that really matters for us non-trolls, though, is how to respond to a troll. Several weeks ago, a young musician in New York criticized Wayne Shorter, a legendary saxophonist who played with Miles Davis in the ’60s and became a widely respected composer in his own right. Ordinarily, this wouldn’t provoke too much controversy; everybody’s entitled to his or her opinion, right? Unfortunately, the phrasing of the comment, which used expletive language to insinuate that Shorter is a musical charlatan who is undeservedly lauded for his contributions to jazz, and the fact that it was shared publicly on Facebook led to a firestorm of replies and social media mini-debates; It even led some musicians to interpret the episode as evidence of the jazz community’s doomed future: a splintering and dissolution of this marginalized artistic community.
As I’ve learned over the years, and as I hope many of those involved with this particular incident have learned, the best way to deal with trolling is to ignore it. Trolling stokes its own fire, and even cases that initially begin as unintentional provocation can turn into trolling—when parties become aggrieved and respond, causing the original provoker to feel defensive and shift from unintentional provocation to great provocation in self-defense. Certain incidents may require the intervention of outside parties, but I’d hesitate to call these incidents trolling. At a certain point, it’s just harassment.
Harassment is bad, and trolling can be bad, but it needn’t be. At this point, sometimes I even enjoy getting trolled just a little bit, but as with drinking and as with art-making, we have to be responsible about it. Troll responsibly.

Last week, the Internet exploded with the latest wave of backlash against HBO series “Girls.” The Feb. 10 episode, “One Man’s Trash,” featured creator and producer Lena Dunham’s character Hannah engaging in a sexual escapade with an older, handsome stranger, played by a guest-starring Patrick Wilson. Amid controversy over how the unconventionally attractive Hannah could possibly snag such a nice-looking man, I’d like to say the following: Thank you, Lena Dunham. Since its premiere in 2012, “Girls” has been both acclaimed and derided, with much criticism focusing on the show’s representation of class privilege. Personally, I’ve never understood this line of attack. Yes, the show explores the lives of privileged women, but it never claims to do otherwise. Critics in this camp seem under the impression that “Girls” wants to represent its generation and fails to do so by focusing on only one specific subset. But at the moment when Hannah utters the widely reprinted quote that instigated this misconception—“I think I may be the voice of my generation. Or at least a voice, of a generation”—she is on drugs, begging for money on the floor of her parents’ hotel room. Her proclamation is ironic. “Girls” aims to speak only for the world it depicts—one of privileged, highly educated, under-skilled twenty-somethings with strong yet vague desires to pursue art—and does so, for the most part, with startling acuity.
But what has puzzled me the most about the discussions of privilege surrounding “Girls” has been the absence of dialogue about Hannah’s atypical Hollywood appearance. While I do think that the complex rendering of the show’s characters is progressive in itself, on the most surface level, it’s true that the experiences of wealthy white people in New York is not new territory for television. However, focusing on a female protagonist that lacks typical body privilege is.
Historically, women have been valued for their status as physical objects. This underlying idea buoys the narratives of countless film and television shows. In romantic comedies, for example, girls undergo makeovers to become conventionally attractive before men will date them. We internalize the idea that women must look a very specific way in order to be loved.
So when “Girls” introduced an alternatively attractive protagonist with the same confidence and romantic prospects as any Hollywood ingénue, I welcomed the breath of fresh air. But as exemplified by last week’s reactions, audiences consistently criticize this aspect of the show for its supposed lack of realism, as opposed to praising it for its truthfulness. Never do these conversations acknowledge that the point of view that finds Hannah’s love life unviable is largely shaped by film and television that propagates partnership standards much less realistic than those depicted on “Girls.”
The dichotomy in perceived attractiveness levels—as illuminated by Dunham and Wilson—provokes such criticism but doesn’t seem to hold up for the opposite gender paradigm, and many saw last week’s episode as Lena Dunham’s response to this reality. We frequently see films in which men with offbeat looks pursue classically attractive women: Woody Allen dates Diane Keaton; Seth Rogen dates Katherine Heigl. These actors’ characters are loved as full packages with personalities, regardless of their lack of traditional handsomeness. Dunham’s tryst with Patrick Wilson is just a gender reversal of the same trope.
However, claiming this is be the episode’s main feat undersells “Girls.” Yes, Dunham is reversing a common stereotype. Yes, she is responding to untruthful claims that “Girls” who look like Hannah can’t date classically attractive men. But she also is actively changing the landscape that gives birth to the points of view that find these depictions unrealistic in the first place. Younger generations will watch television shows like “Girls” and likeminded contemporaries like “Broad City” and see three-dimensional female characters with different looks, shapes, and sizes experiencing fully realized love lives. They will internalize the idea that this is a reality that can happen, just as the generation before them so clearly internalized that it was not. Close-minded notions of who can date whom will begin to expand.
Like almost any television show, “Girls” has its flaws. But it’s also a huge progressive step in the body politics of television. If future shows take up what “Girls” has done well but also rectify its shortfalls by putting together people not just of different sizes and sexual orientations, but also of different races, creeds, and other variations not readily explored on television, the viewing public of the future will change. There won’t be a large audience claiming certain romantic combinations ring false, because all will be represented both in reality and on screen. Let’s own up to the fact that television can shape the way we think—let’s allow it to make progressive strides so that our brains can, too.

What  happens when two very different one-trick ponies co-star together in  one movie? Pretty much what you’d expect, actually. “Identity Thief,”  which opened Friday, is a vehicle for the boisterous Melissa McCarthy to  torture the always dour Jason Bateman. And she does, for nearly two  hours, with plenty of bodily humor to keep the movie entertaining in  short, cringe-inducing bursts. However, the chemistry between the two  never quite materializes, and these frequent pit stops aren’t enough to  justify the movie’s 112-minute runtime.
 Bateman plays his usual hard-luck character: a well-mannered  businessman stuck in a mid-level job and surrounded by idiots. His  character, Sandy Patterson, finally gets a chance at the VP job of a  shiny new investment firm, but he is disgraced when his identity is  swiped by a spa-loving convict—of what Patterson terms “Hobbit  height”—living in Florida (McCarthy). In order to preserve his job,  Patterson must travel from Denver to Florida to nab the thief and bring  her back.
 The chase ignores several easier fixes to the problem: why  doesn’t Patterson cancel the credit cards? Surely the credit companies  can get involved? But of course, a practical solution wouldn’t lead us  to scenes like Patterson and his nemesis wrestling in a lavish Florida  condo, with Patterson eventually smashing her over the head with a  guitar.
And  there’s plenty more where that came from. For better or for worse, the  funniest parts of the movie come from McCarthy’s physical humor, which  carried her through her breakout role in “Bridesmaids.” She drew  snickers from the audience just by appearing on screen in a bright pink  top, eyes bugging out, chubby arms full of cosmetics. She beats Bateman  over the head with a flaming stick, has sex with reckless abandon, and  gets catapulted into the air by a speeding car. Her complete commitment  to these often uncomfortable physical roles deserves some amount of  praise.
 However, it’s too bad that director Seth Gordon has to rely  so heavily on these visual gags to keep the movie humming. Bateman can  be as witty as anyone in the business, but he doesn’t get lines that  show off his expert deadpan delivery. The film sets and maintains a  fairly low bar for comedy; for example, one of the principal recurring  gags is that Sandy is considered a girl’s name. During the lulls in  physical action, the dialogue feels like filler rather than comedic  opportunity, making it hard not to empathize with Bateman’s exasperation  that we haven’t arrived in Denver yet.
 Further hurting the movie is its ridiculous drug  dealer/bounty hunter side plot, in which a collection of buffoons with  varying motives attempts to murder the two leads at every step. However,  their presence is hardly explained or mined for any laughs. This  classic trope can work if ridiculous enough—think Ken Jeong’s sneering  Mr. Chow in “The Hangover”—but here, T.I. and Genesis Rodriguez crash on  and offstage randomly, adding nothing to the action nor the comedy.
 With each passing town, it becomes clear that McCarthy’s  character—unnamed for most of the movie—has deep psychological problems  that can be traced to her being abandoned as a baby and going through  the throes of foster care. “Blame the system!” the movie seems to shout.  Unfortunately, the morals are too little, too late, and out of place.  Moreover, they seem to condone McCarthy’s drunk-driving,  throat-punching, binge-spending ways, a very questionable takeaway point  from a major motion picture.
 In the concluding scene, Gordon finds the balance between  sincerity and humor. A flash-forward shows Patterson and McCarthy’s  character meeting again three years later. The dialogue is warm, fluid,  and optimistic, and the two show a natural rapport. The movie could have  ended there, but McCarthy promptly punches a woman who calls her  “bitch” and gets tasered as M.I.A.’s “Bad Girls” jingles in the  background. Perhaps this is Gordon’s way of acknowledging that the  pairing doesn’t quite work—maybe it’s just better for McCarthy to take  the spotlight and do her thing.

Nick Cave, the brooding and self-absorbed heart of Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, has long dedicated himself to pushing the limits of the musical macabre. Against all odds, the group has attained an even higher level of eccentricity with their newest album, "Push The Sky Away." Cave’s hallmarks include his low register, at-times-threatening lyrics, and tense instrumentals that form a dark frame for his voice. "Push The Sky Away" develops the band’s classic sound, adding an element of lunacy to the band’s traditionally grim yet controlled lyrics and balancing the usually deep tone of the music with more whimsical tropes. The most remarkable feature of the album, however, is the earnestness that persists in Cave’s unwaveringly brooding vocals, which maintains the album’s integrity even as Cave vacillates between his classically disturbing images and the more insubstantial themes that crop up on "Push The Sky Away."
Since their inception in 1983, Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds have recorded 15 albums. Each of these works help to construct the gloomy and pensive oeuvre for which "Push The Sky Away" acts as the culmination. Before its recording, the group was scattered. Cave and a few others branched off to work on a side project, Grinderman, and the original bassist, Barry Adamson, left the group. After the disbandment of Grinderman and Adamson’s decision to rejoin, the group reconvened for their tour de force, "Push the Sky Away."
The first track from the album reveals the group’s newfound fascination with the more cosmetic possibilities of production. The song—whose title, "We No Who U R," might be more at home on a Ke$ha album—proves to be shockingly catchy while still setting the sinister tone for the rest of "Push The Sky Away." Instrumentally, the song derives its success from the combination of airy, feminine backup vocals and flute that balance Cave’s throaty growl. The piano-driven chord progression and clean percussion give the song an unexpected sweetness. The beginning lines of the song contribute to this dulcitude, with Cave softly intoning, "We go down with the dew in the morning light." Almost inevitably, the band deserts the positive vibe and relapses into its classic sound. The lyrics abandon lighthearted natural imagery for an unsettling tone with, "And we know who you are / And we know where you live / And we know there’s no need to forgive," establishing the generally deranged mood of "Push The Sky Away." This song begins the album on a strong note, introducing an attractive, accessible pop sensibility while still remaining cohesive with the rest of the body of work.
The other high point of the album is the beginning of "Higgs Boson Blues," where Cave relinquishes any lyrical inhibitions that may have previously stifled him. Instrumentally, the song is not of particular interest—the instrumentation primarily comprises guitar and percussion, the guitar changing chords only every other measure and the drums not doing much more than keeping the time. The decision to err on the side of simplicity here, however, intentionally highlights Nick Cave’s voice and, more specifically, lyrics. The beginning of the song logically approaches the two titular topics: the Higgs Boson and the blues. Cave begins the song with a narrative setup, "I’m driving my car down to Geneva," which is the location of the Large Hadron Collider where the Higgs Boson was investigated; he also makes reference to Robert Johnson, an influential blues singer. Within this concrete frame, Cave’s lyrics are free to reach a new state of fevered brilliance, and he sings, "Well here comes Lucifer / With his canon law / And a hundred black babies runnin’ from his genocidal jaw." The first half of "Higgs Boson Blues" is marked by lyrics that feel wildly surrealistic yet strike a chord of earnestness that makes the song feel genuine despite its mania.
In the song’s second half, however, the major flaw of "Push The Sky Away" comes to the fore as the cohesiveness of the lyrics falter over awkward allusions to pop culture which clash with the mood of the band. Among a gallimaufry of inexplicable lines, Cave’s apparent obsession with everybody’s favorite Disney starlet becomes evident in the lines "Hannah Montana does that African savanna" and "Miley Cyrus floats in a swimming pool in Toluca Lake." It is in lyrical moments such as these that the songs seem to lose the balance between eccentricity and gravity. It is evident that Nick Cave believes in these lyrics, but his conviction only carries him so far.
The atmospheric, experimental "Push The Sky Away" marks the reinventive return of Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds. Even with the new turns that the group takes, though, it still feels like a sincerely crafted album. Of course, because of Cave’s singular mind, some of the elements that arise from his sincerity can be jarringly strange. An overwhelming majority of the album is captivating, and the candor with which it is presented makes "Push The Sky Away" a memorable album in the extensive discography of Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds.

“Pirate Flag”
Kenny Chesney, “Life on a Rock”
 
Country superstar Kenny Chesney released this summery single just in time for the winter storm Nemo. "Pirate Flag" celebrates a man who trades in his small-town life for a full-time party with rum, pirate flags, and "island girls." Chesney releases his signature drawl over an introductory bed of acoustic guitar and rhythmic clapping, which is soon overwhelmed by a more driving beat as Chesney slips deeper into pirate mode. The story is somewhat undermined by logical gaps—Chesney claims to have ridden the bus to his Caribbean getaway—and its forced rhyming makes it a difficult sing-along. Still, the song’s upbeat tempo and fun, if ridiculous, theme could make it a nice addition to any party playlist.
 
 
“Major Distribution”
50 Cent Ft. Snoop Dogg and Young Jeezy, “Street King Immortal” 
"Major Distribution" is the first single off of 50 Cent’s long awaited album, "Street King Immortal." Throughout the song, 50 rumbles in his signature raspy-melodic voice, "I’m trying to move one brick, two brick, three bricks, four." Presumably intended to sound intimidating, the lines come off sounding like a nursery rhyme written to help children learn how to count. This singsong chorus is composed of three unremarkable verses. Despite its shortfalls, the song is worth a listen, as it features Snoop Lion as his former, rapping Snoop Dogg self. But don’t get excited for a Doggy-Dog return—the song was recorded before Snoop adopted his new reggae persona.

“Mirrors”
Justin Timberlake, “The 20/20 Experience” 
After half a decade without Justin Timberlake, two new singles in the space of a few weeks feels like rain in the desert. "Mirrors" the eight-minute second single off of "The 20/20 Experience," evokes a soulful, ‘90s R&B feel. The song takes a while to warm up, beginning as a synth-driven ballad that seems as if it would be more at home on an All-American Rejects album. The first verse, rife with cliched images, ends with an almost stalkerish declaration—"Just know that I’m always / Parallel on the other side." JT redeems himself with a catchy hook and chorus and a slow-clap in the second half of the song. The song’s theme is perfect for JT’s comeback album, too. One can’t help but feel Timberlake is singing directly to the listener when he declares, "I don’t want to lose you now," or, "You were right here all along."

The memoir “True Notebooks” begins similarly to many education dramas: a man walks into a raucous classroom filled with at-risk youth. Anybody who has seen “Freedom Writers,” “Stand and Deliver,” or “Coach Carter” can predict how the rest of the story should go: the man will slowly win over the troubled teens and—despite seemingly insurmountable odds—the students will flourish and become fine, on-track young adults. The beauty in “True Notebooks: A Writer’s Year at Juvenile Hall” is in its ability to transcend this worn-out narrative.
In the book, author Mark Salzman tracks his challenging first year as a writing teacher at Los Angeles’s Central Juvenile Hall. Salzman is deeply wary of his memoir becoming a feel-good, bootstrappin’ tale. In fact, at the beginning of the story, when Salzman is trying to talk himself out of teaching the class, he writes, “Reasons not to get involved…The Cliché Problem: white guy with everything going for him telling dark-skinned kids in prison that art matters.” By acknowledging this risk from the start, “True Notebooks” defies cliché and instead offers a candid narrative of juvenile hall and the boys who live there. It was this authenticity of the book that gave me critical perspective at two distinct times in my life.
I first read “True Notebooks” in seventh grade. Like many great books, it transported me into a world different from my own. Through Salzman’s recollections I discovered the inner workings of L.A.’s Central Juvenile Hall; through inmates’ poems and essays I saw gang fights, drive-by shootings, and Russian roulette. Yet the book gave me a different perspective than other books and movies about inner city America. Other accounts of wayward youth led me to believe that a strong role model and a positive attitude was all it took to turn someone’s life around. “True Notebooks” shattered that illusion.
Many of the boys featured in “True Notebooks” face bleak futures. Kevin Jackson—my favorite character and arguably Salzman’s favorite student—shows tremendous growth throughout the story. He becomes a leader in the classroom and helps recruit others to join the class. He shows true remorse for the gang-related shooting that ended in the death of a teenager—even though he belongs to a rival gang—and in Salzman he finds a role model. Yet, in the penultimate chapter, Jackson’s sentencing at the end of his time at Juvenile Hall results in 66 years to life in federal prison, and he is immediately transferred to a maximum-security facility near Sacramento. Kevin’s story was devastating, but it provided some much-needed perspective. “True Notebooks” stood in my seventh-grade mind as a worthy counter-narrative to standard white savior spiels, deserving in its unwillingness to be anything other than an account of harsh reality.
My second reading of “True Notebooks” left me feeling not depressed, but inspired. When I revisited the book last year, its subject matter was no longer alien to me. I was working full-time at a middle school in Watts—a neighborhood in south Los Angeles historically known for intense gang violence. I was assigned to assist a class of eighth graders, all of whom had scored “far below basic” on the California Standards Test. The harsh realities I had learned about in “True Notebooks” were right in front of me: gang fights occurred nearly every week, gunshots interrupted class on more than one occasion, and my students continued to fail test after test. I had no illusions that I would be the hero in a beautiful underdog story.
In March, my favorite student was sentenced to six months for a gang-related crime. I knew he would be sent to L.A.’s Central Juvenile Hall, the very place I had come to know when I first found “True Notebooks.” I picked up the story again to try to gain perspective on where my student would be spending his 14th birthday and summer vacation.I left the book once more with a renewed outlook on the world. The last page of the memoir is a poem that Jackson sent to Salzman from his high security cell. In the poem, Jackson outlines the bleakness of his situation, yet maintains a hopeful attitude:
“I still have a long journey to go / But I’ll be free again /  I’ll use this time to grow / In not just one way, but all / There’s a lot for me to learn / So I’m gonna start like a baby, with a crawl.”
With my rereading of the poem, Kevin Jackson’s story—the very story that had depressed me in seventh grade—became a beacon of hope. No, Kevin’s life was not going to be filled with success or happiness. Yes, Kevin would probably spend the rest of his life in jail. And yet, the existence of a book that captured Kevin’s story was reassuring, even hopeful; I could truly believe this cautious optimism for the simple reason of Salzman’s commitment to the truth.

Karen Russell’s latest work, “Vampires in the Lemon Grove,” is built from puzzle pieces. Each component—one of eight short stories—is simple, shaped by simple plots, colored in by simple characters. Each tells a separate tale, of age-old vampires, tattoos with the ability to alter the past, women who produce silk like worms. Each suffers a similar flaw: underdeveloped characters and heavy-handed messages. Fit together, however, the simple pieces transform into a complex picture of fate, human agency, overcoming the past, and the power of story. While intriguing as a whole, the flaws marking individual parts ultimately detract from the collection’s merit.
“Vampires in the Lemon Grove” is never uninteresting, not for its plot twists or artistry, but simply for Russell’s creativity in coming up with storylines. The author alternates between magical realism, realistic fiction, and fantasy in her eight stories. The premise of each is original: for example, a vampire couple who feast on lemons, a boy trying to take control of his fate from seagulls, another boy who must carry a window through a snowstorm on the frontier, a barn that holds ex-presidents in horses’ bodies, and a man explaining rules for tailgating in the Antarctic. While promising, the stories mostly fail to deliver and instead remain underdeveloped and offer little more than the originality of their plots.
Exemplary of this trend is the collection’s seventh story, “The New Veteran.” The protagonist is a massage therapist named Bev who has been assigned to treat a veteran suffering from PTSD and back pain after his friend was killed in Iraq. As she treats him, his tattoo becomes animate, a moving manifestation of his pain. The more she massages it, the better he feels, but she begins to realize the cost: her own sanity. While the premise is fascinating, the delivery is lackluster. In key moments of tension, the protagonist and soldier’s responses are unexpected or even inexplicable because Russell doesn’t devote time to develop or explore the characters’ emotions except in small revelatory moments. For example, when Bev treats the soldier for the first time, he begins to tell her the story of his tattoo, playfully shifting his hips to make it move. When she starts massaging him, however, he instantly turns sour, snapping at her without reason when she asks whether the massage is helping. Moments like this never build and are never explained, and so the characters remain unsympathetic and unrealistic, nothing more than vessels for the story.
The collection is as flawed in language as it is in character development. Russell does occasionally succeed in being poetic; in the first story, “Vampires in the Lemon Grove,” she writes, “Only one or two lemons tumble from the branches each hour, but I’ve been sitting here so long their falls seem contiguous, close as raindrops.” Just as often, however, her attempts at poetry leave the language overwrought and ineffective, landing in phrases like “We bump our fangs and feel like we’re coming up against the same hard truth.” When the language is neither poetic nor overworked, it remains uninteresting, offering no more than the ideas it conveys.
While the individual stories suffer, Russell does well in treating the collection as a whole. Each story is connected to the rest, often referencing its predecessors in some way—for example, Bev’s friend tells her to stop acting like a whale, a remark recalling another story that concerns a fight between krill and whales. While the messages are simple when taken alone—how we cannot overcome fate, how stories can be extremely dangerous—when combined in this way, they contradict and build upon one another. Eventually, then, what Russell presents is a complex treatment of these themes that is far more interesting than what she could accomplish in any one story.
In the second story, “Reeling for the Empire,” Russell makes her most successful foray into magical realism: an agent recruits young women to work in a factory, serves them tea that turns them partially into silkworms, and leaves them with the ability to create silk from within. Toward the end of the story, the protagonist realizes that if she focuses within, she can create silk that can be used to make a cocoon that perhaps can help her free herself from her misery. Were Russell to follow her own advice and focus more on the internal workings of her stories, perhaps her collection would have surpassed its basic success and become something truly beautiful.

Ben T. Zauzmer '15, an Applied Math concentrator in Mather House, gained Internet fame last year for his strikingly accurate predictions of who would win the 2012 Oscars. This year, he's at it again.
Using results from similar awards shows, critics' picks, and other available data, Zauzmer runs statistical analyses to determine the probability that nominated movies, directors, or actresses will win in their given categories this Sunday. Flyby sat down with Zauzmer to talk movies and math.
 
Flyby: How long have you been interested in the Oscars?
BZ: My interest in the Oscars goes back many years, although last year was the first time I tried to predict the Oscars with math. Last year went well. [I got] all 8 of the major categories [and] 15 out of 20 overall.
 
Flyby: What are your predictions for this year?
BZ: For Best Picture right now it's "Argo" at 60%. I don't use personal predictions, just math. For Best Director it's Ang Lee for "Life of Pi," and then the acting awards are: Daniel Day Lewis for "Lincoln," and Jennifer Lawrence from "Silver Linings Playbook." For Best Supporting Actor, it's Harvard's own Tommy Lee Jones '69. That's going to be a little closer, with Christoph Waltz from "Django Unchained" being a close second. And then Anne Hathaway is the runaway favorite, mathematically, for Best Supporting Actress [in "Les Misérables"]. 
 
Flyby: How do you get the data for these predictions?
BZ: A lot of time spent on the Internet, on MetaCritic, Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB, Wikipedia, the websites of different guild awards, the Oscars' website, etc., gathering it all, throwing it in Excel, then using Excel and Mathematica and Stata to actually come up with the formulas. Much of it this year was done over winter break. I had a wonderful break gathering data about movies and watching movies. 
 
Flyby: How has it been having your predictions garner a lot of press?
BZ: It's been a lot of fun, people from all over the world have been interested. I think a lot of people are on there because they're filling out their own Oscar polls this weekend, they want to give it their best shot. I know last year at Harvard, some kid entered his freshman dorm's Oscar pool. He won after using my picks, and he gave me a bar of chocolate that he had won. So that's always fun.
 
 
Flyby: As far as you know, are you the only person who has done statistical Oscar predictions based on data instead of just general consensus?
BZ: Last year, I was the only person, because I scoured the Internet and did not find a single other [Oscar prediction website] as far as I know. This year, there are a couple others that have just started. I think it's all just for fun, and it's great to see other people getting in on the mix. I don't necessarily agree with their models mathematically. I think a lot of other people are using data that they expect to be predictive [but is not]. A good example is box office data, for Best Picture. You think, "Oh, a movie is more popular with viewers, it's more likely to win Best Picture." Unfortunately, the math doesn't hold. The Huffington Post Model heavily relies on that. But, at the end of the day, I might prove more right than them, they might prove more right than me, just by random chance. 
 
Flyby: In your findings, what is the biggest predictor of Oscar winnings?
BZ: It depends on the category. For Best Picture, right now, I believe it is the win for the Directors' Guild. BAFTAs are huge in a lot of categories. If I had to pick one that was overall the closest mirror to the Oscars, it's easily the BAFTAs. There is no polling from the Academy. If there were, that would make my job so much easier, and the percentages could be a lot higher.
 
Flyby: Are there any awards shows that seem to not be a good predictor for Oscar wins at all?
BZ: Oh, sure, a good example is the Golden Globes. I have all the data in my spreadsheet, and so last year I checked it, this year I checked it again, the answer is still no. When you do the multiple regression, you come out with a negative coefficient. The Golden Globes are famous, historically, for not being a great predictor.
 
Flyby: Have you ever thought of applying your methods to other awards shows, like the Emmys?
BZ: Yes, I have, and right now there's just not enough data for the Emmys, the Grammys, the Tonys. What you need is a lot of other people, award shows, critic scores, and it just doesn't exist for everything else I've seen.
 
 
Flyby: What are your plans for the Oscars this weekend?
BZ: I will be watching them in Mather. Last year I hosted an Oscar party for the freshman class [and] I got about 70 people, that was a lot of fun. I don't know how well this will go, there's an enormous amount of chance, part art and part science. Science at best could predict the majority of the Oscars, but I fully expect that there's still a lot of reason to be nervous Sunday night. I think that's why they're so much fun.

Centering around a Princeton University admissions officer,  “Admission,” an upcoming film starring Tina Fey and Paul Rudd, will  strike anyone who has ever applied to a highly selective university as  all too familiar. In the film, directed by Paul Weitz, Fey plays Portia  Nathan, an admissions officer who encounters Jeremiah, an eccentric yet  intellectually gifted prospective applicant from an alternative high  school. Jeremiah has a slim chance of getting into Princeton, but Portia  soon learns that he might be the son she gave up for adoption years  ago.
Inquisitive parents and applicants with long lists of extraordinary  achievements populate the film, giving  viewers a sense of the  obsessive effort that is poured into the tens of thousands of  application packets that arrive in offices like Portia’s every year.  Anyone who has successfully gone through the college application process  will likely laugh at the pitch-perfect depiction of parental  anxiousness and at the portrayal of overachievers vying for coveted  acceptances. But students still wrapped up in the process—especially  those counting down the days until April 1—might be further discouraged  by the visual representation of the impossible odds of landing a spot in  a “dream school” and disheartened by the apparent well-rounded  flawlessness of an ideal applicant.
“Admission” captures the draining and sometimes panic-inducing  process of  Ivy League admissions, but the film is about much more than  that. During a press conference in New York City on Feb. 8, director  Paul Weitz said that although the film is set in one of the nation’s top  universities, it is not meant to serve as a laudatory celebration of  the Ivy League.  “I personally don’t think it matters where you go to  college. It’s about who you come across when you’re there. You can come  out of a great school having been undereducated in the most important  things in life,” he said. The film, similarly, is about how the  trajectory of someone’s life, regardless of how carefully planned out,  can be completely altered by people they encounter and with whom they  connect.
Audience members may see some of themselves in Jeremiah (Nat  Wolff), and Wolff’s own experience in filming for “Admission” was a  classic case of art imitating life: he is a second-semester high school  senior who, like Jeremiah, is preparing to decide where to spend the  next four years of his life. Wolff met with his college adviser just  three days after reading the script, and at the press conference, he  described his anxiety over his own college applications.
The films marks a more dramatic role for Fey, who prior to this  film starred in NBC’s “30 Rock” and the 2010 comedy “Date Night” with  Steve Carell. For the film’s stars, though, more important than  assigning the film to a specific genre was conveying the complex set of  emotions in each scene. According to Fey, the approach was to draw out the elements of  comedy and drama in each scene and depict those moments as honestly as  possible. “It’s a human and heartfelt story, and you just try to play  the tone that seems to be presenting itself on the page,” she said.
Paul Rudd plays John Pressman, an administrator at Jeremiah’s high  school, and he also spoke at the conference about the unique  opportunities offered by a film with elements of both comedy and drama.  “Comedy is an effective means of conveying something dramatic. Life is  funny, life is dramatic, and those tend to be my favorite kinds of  stories,” he said. Weitz noted that to balance these elements successfully, comedy  needs to emerge from the drama organically. A good movie will balance  both naturally, he said. “The characters don’t know they’re being funny  in any good comedy. The most fun thing is seeing a character emerge and  to have actors walking that line [between comedy and drama].”
For all involved, the film seems to have been an enjoyable and  cooperative effort. Filming on location at Princeton was permitted,  which provided cast members with some of their favorite scenes. During  the press conference, Fey said that one of her most memorable scenes was  one in which her character stomps around campus in aggravation, but her  tantrum is juxtaposed by the jaunty background music provided by a  Princeton a capella group—which she encounters and pushes past in the  middle of their song.
This combination of light-hearted humor and emotion is a defining  component of the film—“Admission” deals with the often-harrowing journey  of applying to college with both levity and realism. The cast hopes the  setting and the subject matter of the film will strike a chord with  both the hopeful high-schoolers and the college constituents in the  audience.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Concealed in a Harvard repository, accessible only by special request, are some remarkable materials whose potential to influence collective memory is considerable, and whose public disclosure could be significant. The Tiananmen archives of the Harvard-Yenching Library contain thousands of photographs, manuscripts, and newspaper articles detailing the violent military crackdown of June 4, 1989, on student demonstrators in Beijing. The recent debate on library digitization, in the context of the Collections Digitization Program of the Harvard College Library, has not yet touched upon the Tianamen archives, whose role nonetheless appears significant in such a discussion. Although the sensitive nature of the material poses concerns about the safety of authors and interviewees alike, enough time has passed so that the bulk of these materials may be made digitally available to the public without harm, potentially offering novel historical evidence regarding a highly contentious moment in the recent past of China.
Harvard has had a fundamental role in keeping alive the memory of the Tiananmen massacre of June Fourth, a role perhaps best highlighted by the remarks of Lawrence Sullivan, research associate at the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies at the time of the crackdown. Sullivan declared to The Crimson in 1990, “Harvard has become the center of the Chinese dissident community.” The intention to establish a collection of material dealing with the pro-democracy movement of 1989 and its military suppression was first announced by Harvard-Yenching librarian Eugene W. Wu in October 1989. Wu, whose efforts were pivotal to the creation of the archives, talked of the Tiananmen collection to the Harvard Gazette at the time of his retirement in 1997. The librarian said he was “particularly pleased” with the acquisitions. The library became a recognized center for preserving the memory of June Fourth, and—as relayed by current librarian Xiao-he Ma—outsiders have been sending material for inclusion in the archives up to the present day. Strikingly, the archives include a pair of bloodstained trousers and a jacket, as well as several banners handwritten by the student demonstrators.
“In view of the sensitive nature of some of the targeted materials, strict guidelines will be established regarding access,” Wu wrote in his 1989 announcement, “so as to provide maximum protection for the individuals whose identity might be revealed through these materials.” The potential dangers of a public disclosure of the materials are also highlighted by a notice appended at the front of the senior thesis of Tamar P. Shay ’93, which is included in the archives, and deals with the happenings of June Fourth. “The names of interviewees in this thesis have been disguised by pseudonyms,” Shay wrote. “However, because their identity can be surmised from other information, the safety of the interviewees could be compromised if the thesis comes to the knowledge of the Chinese government.”
Many years have passed, however, and June 2014 will mark the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown. Time has now eroded those dangers that prompted Wu and Shay to keep their work strictly confidential, and an initiative aimed at digitizing some of the Tiananmen archives’ materials could be plausible. While the decision to publicly distribute any single piece of archival evidence will ultimately have to rest with those whom the material concerns, it is conceivable that a critical mass of individuals willing to divulge information about themselves may be gathered. The possibility of a future digitization of the archives is particularly significant in light of the continuing censorship of the 1989 events on Chinese soil. The absence of a museum or memorial to the happenings of Tiananmen within China only adds to the momentousness of the archives.
The importance of the quest for truthful historical memory that countless reporters, scholars, and students carry out daily stands pivotal in the face of persistent censorship. Although potentially long and costly, an initiative to digitize and disclose the Tiananmen Archives could offer fertile ground for more genuine historical investigation, in defiance of the authoritarian winds that many a time have blown to distort collective memory.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sherman McCoy, the testy, testosterone-filled 1980’s bond salesman of Tom Wolfe’s Bonfire of the Vanities, frequently calls himself a “Master of the Universe.” The Master of the Universe is a demigod above the law of us plebeians, egotistically immersed in a life of conspicuous consumption and addicted to the adrenaline-fueled machismo of making billion dollar bets.
Thankfully, McCoy is a frightful fiction—our country’s laws prevent such impertinence. “The United States maintains one of the strongest and most effective anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regimes of the world,” David S. Cohen of the Treasury Department assured the nation.
So when it was discovered that HSBC knowingly laundered for ruthless drug cartels and Russian mobsters, transacted with blackballed organizations that bankrolled Hezbollah and Al-Qaeda, and helped Iran and North Korea evade sanctions, our robust regulatory agencies sounded the bank’s death knell. Right?
Given all the corporations-are-people bluster in the air—and that breathing in the same vicinity as Al-Qaeda, let alone moving billions of dollars for it, are possible grounds for placement on President Obama’s kill list and an eventual zapping-from-the-sky—didn’t our Very Tough Officials press severe criminal charges? HSBC will surely lose its banking license, right?
Wrong.
Not one person behind the decade-long, mind-bogglingly heinous crimes of HSBC will spend a single day in jail. Not one person at HSBC who provided one billion dollars to the terrorist-linked Al-Rajhi bank in Saudi Arabia, or who washed the blood from the hundreds of millions of dollars coming from Mexico’s Sinaloa and Colombia’s Norte del Valle drug cartels, will have to personally pay a single dollar.
Instead the Department of Justice issued a fine for $1.9 billion—about five weeks’ worth of profit.
The new normal of banking is a pattern of massive fraud encouraged—er, punished—by these impotent wrist slaps. Profits are privatized among the shareholders, and losses are subsidized by the taxpaying shmucks. Now, congressional Republicans want to do away with the Volcker Rule so that banks can gamble with their clients’ money too.
There is an epidemic of amnesia when it comes to bank regulation in Washington. Sycophantic lawmakers fawn over CEOs, jockeying for favor and a slice of an almost $500 million lobbying pie. Bending over backwards for the banks, Congress expressed little outrage regarding the HSBC settlement. And less than two weeks after the HSBC settlement came the announcement that UBS was getting away with rate-rigging LIBOR for a measly $1.5 billion.
Basically, a bunch of bankers from prestigious financial institutions like Barclays and the Royal Bank of Scotland colluded to distort the LIBOR index to misrepresent the strength of their banks and make their trades more lucrative. The problem is that LIBOR is a crucial determinant in the prices of hundreds of trillions of dollars worth of assets—any imaginable financial instrument, from college loans to credit cards to mortgages, was artificially distorted to help traders make a few extra dollars on their deals.
In an encouraging change of pace, Senator Elizabeth A. Warren exposed the farcical power of the Very Tough Officials by asking a simple question: “Tell me a little bit about the last few times you've taken the biggest financial institutions on Wall Street all the way to a trial."
The silence was telling. Eventually, Thomas J. Curry, Comptroller of the Currency, mumbled the disheartening, but illuminating, admission that “we do not have to bring people to trial.”
Petulant Congressmen stonewall attempted reforms to the banking system, shredding any legislation into a large, postmodern hodgepodge of exemptions. Warren’s brainchild, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has been repeatedly stymied by Senate Republicans who refuse to confirm any of the president’s nominees for its directorship.
After watering down regulatory laws to the point of irrelevance, Republicans like Senator Marco A. Rubio have the audacity to claim “a major cause of our recent downturn was a housing crisis created by reckless government policies.”
Apparently, financial institutions engorged themselves on toxic, predatory mortgage deals at the behest of the government, when George W. Bush was still in office. Rubio and the Republicans are endorsing a sort of voodoo economics that is completely counter to the facts—maybe there’s something in the water?
There’s an appalling inequality of justice in this country. In the eyes of the government, fraudsters like HSBC and UBS are clearly exempt from the laws. Too big to fail has become too big to jail.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last weekend, up to 50,000 people rallied in Washington, D.C. to protest the creation of the Keystone XL pipeline and the expansion of the tar sands industry. This was the largest climate rally in history, and for good reason. People are finally realizing that society cannot continue to extract new forms of fossil fuels if they care at all about future generations on this planet.
Unfortunately, former Harvard president and current professor Larry Summers didn’t get the memo. In a recent Washington Post opinion piece titled “The growth agenda we need,” Summers lays out a detailed four-point plan to kickstart the American economy—a plan that includes approving Keystone XL. Summers is right in saying that it is time to transform the North American energy sector. But Summers’ plan is far from transformative. Instead, it merely reinforces the dominance of fossil fuels, an energy source that is warming our planet to unprecedented levels.
Summers claims that the U.S. must approve Keystone XL in order to keep tar sands from being exported to Asia, which has far fewer sound environmental regulations. This argument is flawed for two main reasons.
First, it makes the assumption that the morality of our nation is relative to the behavior of other nations. This relativistic viewpoint ignores the simple facts. Burning Canadian tar sands will accelerate the dangerous effects of fossil fuels and climate change, regardless of who does it. Such environmental negligence would threaten 100 million lives by 2030. The World Bank has stated that “adaptation may not be possible” to the world we are currently on track to create. It is hardly an excuse to say that we can commit deadly sins simply because the sins of others might be worse.
The second flaw in Summers’ argument is his assumption that tar sands will continue to be extracted regardless of our behavior. Tar sands can only be transported out of the heart of Canada by three routes: south, through the Keystone XL, west, through the Canadian Rockies and First Nations lands, and east, through New England. And opposition against tar sands expansion has already shown the potential to be an unstoppable force.
Thousands of people have put their bodies on the line to stop expansion to the south. Many have been arrested at the Tar Sands Blockade in Texas. Last fall, 12,000 rallied and 1,253 were arrested in Washington, D.C. to stop Keystone XL, in the largest showing of civil disobedience in 30 years. First Nations peoples of Western Canada have been steadfast in their opposition, and their enhanced legal status gives them a virtual veto over the construction of pipelines on their ancestral lands. Here in New England, Better Future Project and 350.org are working in coalition with other local and national groups to prevent ExxonMobil from shifting the direction of an oil-bearing, 60 year-old pipeline to allow it to export the heavier and more leakage-prone tar sands without the necessary presidential permit. Just two weeks ago, our groups convened over 1,500 people in Portland, Maine as the first potent display of grassroots opposition to this eastern pipeline.
We need a transformation of our energy system, as Professor Summers notes. But this transition must break away from increasing fossil fuel consumption. To some it may seem like the forces of the tar sands industry are too powerful to be stopped. But there are more people fighting for a clean energy future than ever before, and our numbers are growing every day. Our society has reached a point where we can begin to understand a world destroyed by carbon fuels, and we know that this is not a path we should begin to go down.
Rachel Carson said, “We stand now where two roads diverge. But unlike the roads in Robert Frost’s familiar poem, they are not equally fair. The road we have long been traveling is deceptively easy, a smooth superhighway on which we progress with great speed, but at its end lies disaster. The other fork of the road, the one less traveled by, offers our last, our only chance to reach a destination that assures the preservation of the earth.”
The two paths are clear before us. Which one will you choose?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When last year’s graduating seniors were asked to take a survey detailing satisfaction with their concentration, many large departments, like economics and government, received mediocre marks. While it may be tempting to explain away the survey’s lopsided results with such phenomena as, say, students without a particular passion for Pigovian welfare economics selecting the concentration for its lucrative exit opportunities, the fact remains that many Harvard students are not satisfied with their course of study. Harvard’s large concentrations should take the survey’s results seriously and look to smaller concentrations as a model.
In order to best learn from this survey, the College should note that two main factors loosely correlate with a concentration’s popularity: the concentration’s size and the category in which it falls within the arts and sciences. The division with the most satisfied concentrators was the humanities, but even within that category, larger concentrations did relatively poorly. Two of the college’s largest concentrations, economics and government, received notably negative reviews from their concentrators. The exception to these trends was the small concentration of music, which received the lowest satisfaction rating of all concentrations.
Perhaps even more disconcerting than the survey itself, however, are the reactions from some faculty members within poorly performing departments. In several cases, these faculty members, rather than take responsibility for their department’s performance, blamed external factors. The Director of Undergraduate Studies for the Department of Economics, Jeffrey A. Miron, believes that his department’s low satisfaction ratings are an unavoidable by-product of the fact that some concentrations are likely to attract students for reasons of utility: “I think some majors tend to get students because the students love those disciplines, and other majors get students because it’s a useful thing to do,” he said.
Perhaps there is some truth to these explanations, but as the government department’s Director of Undergraduate Studies Cheryl B. Welch rightly said, “that doesn’t mean a big department can’t do better.” Harvard’s large concentrations should not simply shrug off this survey’s results as unfortunate but unavoidable; they should work to create better experiences for their students. Smaller concentrations, many of which did very well on the survey, often feature strong faculty-student interaction and vibrant advising systems. The life sciences have seen an increase in popularity after splitting into a number of smaller concentrations and implementing a more personalized advising system. All concentrations should note the positive effects that such endeavors have yielded and enact similar programs.
Before taking any serious action, of course, the College and its departments should carry out more detailed and accurate surveys of student experience that control for factors like size and reason for concentrating. Even so, poorly performing departments should see the recent concentration satisfaction survey as a wake-up call, and they should contemplate serious changes instead of shunting responsibility onto external factors.
Harvard students should not have to sacrifice satisfaction with their studies if they wish to study a large concentration like economics or government. To the contrary, Harvard’s goal should be to offer a positive concentration experience for all of its students. Taking the recent concentration satisfaction survey seriously and enacting systemic changes per its results would be a key step toward realizing this goal.

Petitions for a nap space in Harvard Yard, extended dining hall hours, and weekend brain break are all slated to receive official responses from Dean of Harvard College Evelynn M. Hammonds, likely by the end of the semester.
The student-initiated petitions were submitted to Hammonds as a part of the “We the Crimson” initiative, started by the Undergraduate Council last November. The initiative features an online portal that students can access to submit petitions and vote for other submitted petitions. At the end of each month, the top three petitions are submitted to the administration for an official response.
One of the petitions, started by Yuqi Hou ’15, proposes the creation of a space in Harvard Yard for students to take naps.
“People don’t realize how important it is to take a nap,” Hou said. “It improves your GPA because you’re actually more focused.”
Hou first thought of the idea in December. After meeting with the Harvard Center for Wellness and Interim Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich, Hou turned to “We the Crimson” to gain student support for her idea.
Hou complemented the petition, which received 184 votes, with an online survey.
Of the 432 students from across the University who responded, only 21 percent felt well-rested on a typical day. Almost 60 percent of those surveyed were in favor of a designated nap room in the Yard.
However, some students who were supportive of the petition also voiced concerns.
Harry W. Hild ’16, supporter of the idea, pointed out that 96 students ranked cleanliness of the nap cushions as the most important factor.
“I’m not sure I’d want to hop on someone else’s beanbag after they’ve used it,” he said.
Two other petitions from January were submitted to the Dean for response.
One petition, which received 238 votes as of Sunday, asks for at least one dining hall to offer service until midnight.
“I’m kind of a night person and often times a 7 p.m. closing time for dinner is pretty early,” said Michael F. Trang ’14, who started the petition.
The other petition asks for the brain break service to include the weekend.
As a Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisor, Margaret E. Crane ’14, who proposed the petition, questioned why brain break isn’t offered on weekend nights.
“Providing students with food past 7 p.m. will allow them to have a full stomach if they choose to drink, and create a social space in the dining hall,” Crane said.
Although all three students hope that the administration will consider their proposals, Hou expressed some skepticism.
“I think that the administration will take a look at [the petition] and decide if there’s enough student support and demand they’ll do it,” Hou said. “But in general, I don’t have too much faith in the administration.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: February 25, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly reported that the 432 Harvard students who responded to an online survey about a proposed nap space were undergraduates. In fact, while 418 of respondents were from the College, the survey also drew responses from students from Harvard’s various graduate schools.

Cass R. Sunstein ’75, a professor at Harvard Law School and former White House appointee, was selected as Harvard’s newest University Professor, the University announced Tuesday. With this distinction, Sunstein joins 23 of Harvard’s most recognized faculty members including the likes of University Professors Lawrence H. Summers, Helen Vendler, and Henry Louis “Skip” Gates, Jr.
In a press release, University President Drew G. Faust announced that Sunstein would assume the Robert Walmsley University Professorship following the retirement of Law School professor emeritus Frank I. Michelman.
“Cass Sunstein’s scholarly work has cast fresh light on long-standing questions and opened new paths for legal theorists,” she said. “He is a scholar, teacher, mentor, colleague, and public servant of uncommon range and distinction.”
Michelman said that he could not be more pleased by the appointment.
“Cass Sunstein has made exceptional contributions to learning, to understanding, to public policy on a remarkable number of different levels,” he said. “He’s the kind of multi-faceted, well-rounded scholar and contributor that I think University professorships should recognize.”
Sunstein said the announcement came as a surprise, and that he was both “honored and humbled.”
“I had in mind: teach my courses and write my articles,” he said. “It’s a great honor that Professor Faust would see fit to do this.”
Sunstein, who is among one of the nation’s most cited legal scholars, has published over 30 books and hundreds of articles in a variety of legal fields including administrative law, constitutional law, environmental law, and labor and employment law.
He left his position as the White House’s administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in August 2012 to return to teaching at Harvard Law School.
“Working in government is the honor of a lifetime. I’ll always be grateful for that opportunity,” he said.
Still, Sunstein noted that he continues to love the classroom experience.
“If you have an idea that might be original and true, that’s a thrilling moment. If students have an idea that’s original and true, that’s completely thrilling,” Sunstein said, reflecting on his classroom experience. “I hope to be the best teacher that I could possibly be. And I hope that my next articles and books are as good as I can make them.”

The Harvard College Democrats, which has not endorsed a candidate in a primary since at least the last five years, broke the tradition Tuesday night, voting 36-1 to support U.S. Rep. Edward J. Markey of Medford in his race against U.S. Rep. Stephen F. Lynch of South Boston. The two men are seeking the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate seat vacated earlier this month by Secretary of State John F. Kerry.
Also at the meeting, the Dems voted, 28-8, to support Divest Harvard, an initiative that calls on the University to withdraw endowment investments from fossil fuel corporations.
Markey seemed to have the endorsement even before the speeches began. Many in the crowd sported “MARKEY FOR SENATE” stickers as they listened to the campaigns’ positions. As the votes were being tallied, members organized support efforts for Markey.
“Maybe they’ll just count the Lynch votes, then subtract them from the total to get the Markey count,” said Dems member Alice F. Hyde ’16 before the meeting began. “That might make things quicker.”
When it came time for the speakers to take the floor, State Rep. Carl Sciortino, speaking for Markey, struck a chord with the crowd. He repeatedly referred to Markey’s progressive stances on climate change, abortion, and LGBTQ rights.
Sciortino praised the Harvard Dems for their successful support of Senator Elizabeth Warren in her campaign last November.
“If you look back at the last couple of election cycles, and what this group at Harvard did, wow,” Sciortino said.
Following Sciortino, Braintree Mayor Joseph C. Sullivan, speaking for the Lynch campaign, began by addressing Lynch’s opponent.
“We think [Markey’s] been a fine congressman, and we’d like to keep him there,” Sullivan told the crowd.
Though he earned appreciative laughs and attention from the crowd, Sullivan was unable to downplay Lynch’s historically conservative record on social issues. In particular, his portrayal of Lynch as holding a pro-choice position on abortion was questioned more than once during the brief question and answer period following Sullivan’s remarks.
After the votes were counted, Harvard Dems president Simon M. Thompson ’14 said he thought Markey’s progressive leanings—especially concerning hot-button issues like climate change, LGBTQ rights, and abortion—drove the endorsement.
“I think that [Markey] and his positions speak well to the progressive views of college students today,” Thompson said.

Harvard Law School students hosted 21 high schoolers from the Boston Debate League Tuesday in a day-long seminar designed to help young debaters improve their policy debate skills. Students attended a criminal law class, toured the University, and heard from law school dean Martha L. Minow and a number of law school professors.
Amy H. Bond, a first-year student at HLS who helped organize the event, said she and other law students were inspired to host the seminar after judging the Boston Debate League’s tournament in January. Impressed by the quality of the high school debaters, Bond and her classmates decided to contribute to the Boston Debate League’s mission—bringing debate to students from Boston’s public schools who might not otherwise experience it.
“Historically, policy debate has been a prohibitively expensive activity,” Bond said, outlining common preparations like debate camp, personal coaching, and tournaments out of town. She added that it is nonetheless an important skill that develops analytical reasoning, research acumen, and persuasive rhetoric. Exposure to policy debate is especially valuable because it is directly applicable to the law profession.
During the seminar, students­—a number of whom competed at the national debate tournament at Harvard last weekend—attended a mock debate between law school professors Michael J. Klarman and Julie C. Suk ’97 on the role of courts in the civil rights movement. HLS librarians demonstrated how to conduct policy research and students also had an opportunity to hear from law professors Daniel J. Meltzer ’72, Charles J. Ogletree, and Jon D. Hanson.
The debaters also learned about student life and admissions at Harvard from an admissions officer and current undergraduates. Michelle E. Choi ’16, who volunteered at the event, said she and other undergraduates who have benefited from debate hope to share similar opportunities with younger students who do not have access to comparable resources. “As of now, a group of undergrads who did debate want to establish a long-term program to have consistent mentorship for these debaters,” she said.
La Alianza, the Black Law Students Association, and the Dean of Students Office co-sponsored the event. Bond said HLS students may consider making the seminar an annual event.

A mover and shaker in the Harvard Athletic Department is taking his talents to Palo Alto. Harvard Assistant Athletic Director Kurt K. Svoboda is now the property of Stanford Athletics.
Stanford University Athletic Director Bernard Muir officially announced Svoboda’s hiring on Tuesday. Svoboda, who served as the Crimson’s public and media relations executive for eight years, will immediately assume a similar role with the Cardinal.
During his time at Harvard, Svoboda directed the Harvard Athletic Department’s transition into the social media age, focusing on cost-effective, online productions rather than on media contracts. Svoboda was responsible for the December hiring of Imry Halevi, Harvard Athletics’ new director of multimedia and production—a position created by Svoboda.
“The remaining Athletic Communications staff deserves much of the credit for the transition [to multimedia],” Svoboda wrote in an email. “We focused on changing our respective skill-sets from that of traditional and graphic design professionals to social media experts and willing multimedia and video editing students.”
Svoboda added that the department “championed what is needed in today’s landscape.”
Under Svoboda’s direction, GoCrimson.com, Harvard’s athletics website, expanded its broadcasting reach. The Harvard Athletic Department has most recently added home varsity wrestling meets to its menu of over 150 live events per year. The department’s video features and productions receive 1.5 million annual views, according to a press release.
Athletic Director Robert L. Scalise said that he would be sorry to see Svoboda go and credited him with making important strides in the athletic department’s multimedia broadcasting.
“We’re really proud of Kurt,” Scalise said. “He made big gains in video streaming and multimedia during his time here. He stayed ahead of the technology and he’s really taking it to the next level.”
In addition to his work in broadcast, Svoboda made waves on other social media platforms. In 2011, Svoboda used Twitter to encourage Associated Press pollsters to watch Harvard men’s basketball games online. The Crimson cracked the AP Top 25 for the first time in program history that year.
Harvard men’s tennis coach David Fish ’72, who has coached at Harvard since 1976, acknowledged Svoboda’s role in exporting the Crimson brand.
“Kurt was a dynamic force in the movement of the Harvard sports communications,” Fish said. “We went from much more of a writing-based to a web and video-based system, and he helped Harvard become the number-one, most-viewed athletics site in the Ivy League. He was dynamic, he tried to treat all the sports fairly, and he assembled a great staff of people who worked really hard for him.”
During his tenure, Svoboda directly managed public relations for 12 of the Crimson’s 41 varsity squads, including Harvard’s football and men’s basketball teams. He will now oversee the communications for the defending Rose Bowl Champions.
“Like at Harvard, I look forward to interacting with a large collection of bright and athletically-talented individuals,” Svoboda said. “I am extremely humbled by the opportunity. I am transitioning from the largest athletic department in the country to the most successful one. Both schools illustrate that students can have the best of both worlds athletically and academically. It is a wonderful privilege to tell that story.”
The Harvard Athletic Department has named Timothy J. Williamson as Interim Director of Athletic Communications. Williamson had served as Svoboda’s assistant since December 2007.

Pakistan’s Ambassador to the United States Sherry Rehman advocated improving international relations while facing tough criticism over domestic issues at the Institute of Politics Tuesday night.
Meghan L. O’Sullivan, professor of the practice of international affairs at the Harvard Kennedy School, set the tone for the night when welcoming the speaker.
“She really embodies the bridge between these two countries,” Sullivan said. “As we well know, this is a difficult relationship, but also a consequential relationship.”
Rehman opened by echoing hopes for a sustainable relationship between the United States and Pakistan, focusing her address on lessons learned from the past.
Rehman referenced the war in Afghanistan with its political, social, and cultural implications. She highlighted its continued centrality in the countries’ current discourse, yet emphasized the danger in repeating the mistakes of the past.
“Even if we had somehow crafted and executed the best of policies, Pakistan was left with some of the world’s largest population of refugees,” Rehman said. “They are the forgotten statistic from that war. Ladies and gentleman, Pakistan cannot afford a repeat of the 1980s.”
The ambassador also called for positive changes in disposition to ensure a sustainable relationship.
“Coarse diplomacy through the media is not the way to diplomacy. We need to talk issues through,” Rehman said.
The night transitioned to a forum where attendees, many from Pakistan or of Pakistani descent, requested the ambassador’s insight into some of the country’s most poignant issues.
Rabeea Ahmed ’14 asked the ambassador of the current mass killings in Balochistan and the government’s response to such violations of human rights.
Syed Shehroz Hussain received resounding applause after questioning the ambassador why his late father, a Shia leader in Pakistan, was not provided with the protection he requested.
“My government has treated this act of senseless murder as quite unconscionable and frankly unacceptable as it presents a clear and present danger to us and how we seek to protect our citizens,” Rehman said. “If our citizens are unempowered or endangered it is the failure of our government.”
As tensions subsided, the ambassador chose to end the night on a positive note.
“Enough of looking back,” Rehman said. “We are looking forward rather than looking backwards. Let me assure you, history will not end in 2014. Pakistan hopes to be a valuable partner and friend beyond that milestone.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 21, 2013, at 1:02 a.m.
EdX, the nonprofit online learning venture started by Harvard and MIT last May, announced Wednesday that it is doubling in size and expanding internationally with the addition of six new schools to its consortium.
EdX’s institutional members now include Australian National University, Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland, McGill University and the University of Toronto in Canada, and Rice University in Texas.
While edX users have come from all over the world since the platform’s launch last spring, the new partnerships in North America, Europe, and Australia will mark the first time online courses are developed offshore.
“Each of these schools was carefully selected for the distinct expertise they bring to our growing family of edX institutions,” said Anant Agarwal, president of edX, in a press release. “We remain committed to growing edX to meet the needs of the world while maintaining a superior learning experience for all.”
Beginning in late 2013, ANUx, DelftX, EPFLx, McGillX, RiceX, and TorontoX will offer courses in topics ranging from science and the humanities to public policy.
Classes announced so far include ANUx’s “Engaging India” and “Astrophysics,” the latter taught by Nobel Laureate Brian P. Schmidt. Additionally, “Introduction to Aerospace Engineering,” “Solar Energy,” and “Water Treatment Engineering,” will be offered later this year, all through DelftX. Finally, students of TorontoX will be able to take “Terrestrial Energy System,” “Behavioral Economics,” “The Logic of Business: Building Blocks for Organizational Design,” and “Bioinformatic Methods.”
These universities join founders Harvard and MIT, as well as the University of California, Berkeley, the University of Texas System, Wellesley College, and Georgetown University in the X University Consortium.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Of the 2195 fans who packed Lavietes Pavilion on Saturday night to watch Harvard top Princeton, one has a particularly large stake in the future of the Crimson men’s basketball program.
Harvard commit Zena Edosomwan was in the stands for Saturday’s contest to cheer on the Crimson.
“I’m just excited to watch these guys play, but at the same time, it’s just, wow,” Edosomwan said. “I’m so excited for the next level. Look at the fans out here today. The crowd was so electric. Just honestly seeing how far the program has come, and how they’re playing, I’m very excited.”
Edosomwan, who turned down offers from Cal, UCLA, Texas, USC, Washington, and Wake Forest when he picked the Crimson last spring, is currently attending Northfield Mount Hermon in western Massachusetts.
Despite the fact that he is currently in the midst of his own season, Edosomwan says he keeps close tabs on the Crimson.
“I’m always keeping track,” he said,
Edosomwan and his teammates at NMH took on Harvard’s club team on Sunday afternoon at Lavietes Pavilion.
The 6’8” forward saw limited minutes in a 84-41 NMH victory. Playing in front of the Harvard coaching staff—including head coach Tommy Amaker—and a smattering of current Crimson players, Edosomwan posted 10 points and 12 boards, according to MaxPreps.com.
Edosomwan did all of his damage in the paint, finishing a variety of put-back and reverse layups.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Kenyatta Smith had a monster weekend for Harvard men's basketball, almost netting the first triple-double in school history and earning this week’s top honors. However, in a great week for Harvard sports fans, three other Crimson athletes put in impressive performances.
Amanda Sobhy, Women’s Squash
Women’s squash beat Trinity to clinch the national championship this week for the 14th time in program history. Sobhy has dominated competition for the past two years and in the deciding match this week she was up against Kanzy El Defrawy, the only player to ever even take a game from Sobhy in her career when the two met earlier in the season. There was to be no repeat this time as Sobhy dispatched the freshman, 11-8, 11-7, 11-8, taking Harvard to the top of the college arena.
 
DJ White, Men’s Volleyball
Penn State came to Harvard riding a 51-game conference win streak and a No. 9 ranking in the country. Expecting a comfortable win, they were instead shocked by the Crimson, led by sophomore DJ White, who produced arguably their biggest win of all time and their first ever over the Nittany Lions. White was dominant with 13 kills and a killing percentage of .500 in a superlative performance.
 
Steven Keith, Men’s Wrestling
After senior Walter Peppelman recently became the seventh wrestler in Crimson history to achieve 100 career wins, this week Steven Keith followed suit. The senior went a perfect 2-0 with his 100th and 101st victories over Brown and Boston University, respectively, this week, cementing his place on the all-time list.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“This is Harvard Hockey, A Tradition of Excellence.”  The tag-line on Harvard men’s hockey’s media guide doesn’t leave much room for error. 21 Ivy League titles, 12 Frozen Four Appearances, the 1989 NCAA Championship; the Crimson’s history dating back to 1897 backs up the guide’s bold claim. More than any other Harvard sport, save for crew, the men’s ice hockey program here in Cambridge boasts accolades not only impressive for a highly-academic school in the Ivy League, but also relevant on a national level.
With nine NHL Draft picks, a returning First-Team All-American in captain Danny Biega and a No. 17 preseason ranking, the Crimson appeared poised to reignite that tradition of excellence this season. Instead, with four regular season games left on the schedule, Harvard currently sits in last place in the ECAC at 4-12-2 (7-15-3 overall). For the seventh straight year, the Crimson entered February with a losing record. My question to Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 and everyone associated with the program is: What gives?
In years past, Donato has responded with the reasonable answer that the nature of Harvard’s schedule—a late start to the season compounded by a lengthy winter break—has prevented sustained momentum. This claim has been given some legitimacy by Donato’s teams’ composite record in the month of February. Since Donato took over the reins of the program from Mark Mazzoleni in 2004, the Crimson has gone 40-26-8 (.595) in 74 February games and just 83-88-27 (.487) in all other games. Recently, the difference has been even more pronounced. In the last five years, Harvard is 24-26-7 (.482) in games played after Feb. 1, and 26-57-17 (.345) in games played before that date.
The Crimson is currently on a four-game unbeaten streak, the longest unbeaten stretch in what has been another long, disappointing season. With a win over No. 15 Boston University and a tie against No. 19 Dartmouth, it would seem that Donato’s self-fulfilling prophecy of late-season resurgence is making another appearance. After dealing with inconsistencies inherent to the team’s schedule, the Crimson is finally realizing its potential. It’s a classic story of redemption.
The only problem is, these scheduling problems are not unique to Harvard. Both No. 13 Yale and the Big Green are in the Top 20 despite dealing with almost identical schedules. Ivy league teams don’t start until late October—as opposed to early October for other ECAC teams—and generally have around a two-week winter break at the end of December. If these other teams are able to build and maintain momentum in the early season and sustain that momentum through the end of the year, then what makes Donato’s Harvard teams exceptional?
This season, the Crimson has been hit with a number of personnel issues, notably the departure of defensive mainstays Patrick McNally and Max Everson. This has contributed to a slew of defensive issues that have led to Harvard giving up 79 goals against, third worst in the ECAC. But despite NHL-caliber offensive firepower in freshmen Jimmy Vesey (Nashville Predators, third round) and Brian Hart (Tampa Bay Lightning, second round), sophomores Colin Blackwell (San Jose Sharks, seventh round) and Petr Placek (Philadelphia Flyers, sixth round) and senior Alex Fallstrom (Boston Bruins, fourth round), the Crimson is currently last in the conference with just 56 goals scored in 25 games.
Making things worse, after leading the nation in power-play conversion percentage last season, Harvard is 58th out of 59 NCAA Division I hockey programs, scoring on just 11 percent of its power-play opportunities. Clearly something more is amiss.
In the past, calls for Donato’s job have been silenced by late-season success, and with the team’s recent form and the ECAC tournament looming in just a few weeks’ time, that may very well happen again. But Harvard should critically assess what it considers excellence on the hockey rink. Donato carries prestige, having played on that 1989 national championship team and following it up with a long career in the NHL. He has displayed an incredible ability to recruit top-shelf talent, with recent Donato recruits Alex Killorn ’12 and Louis Leblanc, formerly ’13, contributing to the Lightning and Montreal Canadiens, respectively, and the likes of Hart, Vesey and Biega sure to follow.
These factors all contribute to building up the aura around one of Harvard’s premier athletic programs, but unless Donato can find a way to make the successes of the name on the front of the jersey match the successes of the names on the back, consistently over an entire season, Harvard hockey will continue to represent a tradition far-removed from excellence: that of disappointment and unmet expectations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’ve never been to Ithaca. I hear it’s gorges.
But on Saturday night, I had to double-check my GPS when I walked into the middle of the third period of the Harvard-Cornell men's hockey game. I was greeted by a sea of Waldos. Big Red-and-white-striped fans must have occupied a solid three-fourths of the seats at the Bright Hockey Center.
Why was the Harvard presence so weak? The most obvious answer is that the Crimson men’s hockey team (and Cornell’s squad, for that matter) has reduced itself to irrelevancy this season. But that’s not the reason I—and I suspect many other Harvard students—avoided the first 50 minutes of a classic hockey rivalry.
I had been busy watching a meaningful game—a game that carried real postseason implications, a game that would shape a Crimson team’s fate for the remainder of the season. I’m writing, of course, about the Harvard men’s basketball team’s 69-57 triumph over Princeton.
Ivy League basketball and ECAC hockey are two totally different animals. In Ancient Eight hoops, every game counts. The regular season is essentially a big round-robin tournament that decides which team goes to the Big Dance in March.
Comparatively, the ECAC regular season means jack squat. Sure, regular season success satiates a hungry fan base and provides helpful postseason positioning. But beyond that, a first-place finish or a 12th-place finish does not guarantee a team’s final fate. Just ask 11th-seeded Brown, which reached the ECAC semifinals in 2010, or sixth-seeded Harvard, which won it all in 2004. All 12 teams have a shot in the ECAC Tournament.
Few sports leagues offer a bottom-feeder the opportunity to renovate a season in just six games. In recent years, the Harvard men’s hockey team has embraced this opportunity. In 2013, the Crimson will have to welcome the postseason with open arms like never before.
The bottom line: The season is not lost. It can be saved.
The Crimson’s recent play is indicative of a team preparing for another last-minute push. After an eight-game losing streak, Harvard has been unbeaten in its last four, winning two and tying two. The Crimson has not necessarily found a way to win, but it has found a way not to lose.
In the past couple of weeks, it seems that Harvard’s senior players have realized that they have one final chance to rewrite their legacy.
“We [seniors] want to make an impression or at least go out on top as much as we can,” senior forward Marshall Everson told me the day before the Crimson’s Beanpot consolation game versus Boston University.
In that game, seniors scored six of Harvard’s seven goals in a 7-4 win. Four days later, seniors contributed the Crimson’s first three goals in a 4-1 victory over Colgate.
Underperformances from Harvard’s veterans have characterized much of the Crimson’s struggles this year. But Everson, Luke Greiner, Alex Fallstrom, and Danny Biega appear to be righting the ship.
Injuries and sudden departures have also plagued Harvard this season, but things are starting to look up in the personnel department. Most notably, rookie Kyle Criscuolo has started to hit his playmaking stride after returning from the disabled list at the beginning of the month.
The freshman center has recorded five assists in the last five games. With Criscuolo out of the lineup, the Crimson posted a 1-9-0 record. With Criscuolo in, Harvard has gone 6-6-3.
Expectations are a funny thing. ECAC preseason polls picked Cornell and Harvard to finish second and third, respectively. The two squads now sit at the bottom of the conference.
Harvard’s underachievement has made this regular season one of the most painful in program history. Can Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 possibly gain absolution for this year’s circus? If Harvard continues to improve and builds off of its recent postseason surprises, I think he can.
Fans will not remember Harvard’s 2010-11 campaign for the Crimson’s lackluster 7-14-1 regular season record. They will remember that Harvard fought within an overtime goal of advancing to the ECAC semis. The 2011-12 season isn’t memorable for Harvard’s record-setting frustration in the “ties” department during the regular season. Fans will remember the Crimson’s run to the ECAC finals.
It’s going to take a lot to erase the memory of this regular season, but Harvard has to take comfort in the fact that there remains something to play for next month. At this point, the ECAC Tournament is the light at the end of a long, dark, and rather meaningless tunnel.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sophomore center Kenyatta Smith had the performance of his career for the Harvard men’s basketball team this weekend.
By leading the Crimson to two victories over Penn and Princeton at Lavietes Pavilion, Smith helped widen Harvard’s advantage in the Ivy League standings and the race for an automatic NCAA tournament bid that comes along with an Ancient Eight title. With the win against the second-place Tigers, Harvard now has a 1.5 game lead in conference play, which becomes increasingly important as the madness of March approaches.
Until last weekend, Smith had not lived up to his high school expectations. The three-star prospect was the Crimson’s highest rated recruit in his class and according to Scout.com was the nation’s No. 13 ranked center coming out of Flintridge Prep School in La Canada, Calif. But during his freshman season, he averaged just 2.1 minutes per game and only saw action in eight games.
So far this season, he has enjoyed more playing time, averaging 12.4 minutes per game in 20 games. Even with the increase in playing time, Smith has only started seven times, with Harvard coach Tommy Amaker using him as a post presence off the bench in the past 15 games.
But Friday was different, as the sophomore broke out in historic fashion with one of the best games Harvard has seen all season. Against Penn, Smith shattered the Crimson’s all-time blocks record of seven—which had stood since 1977—when he turned away 10 shots in 31 minutes of play. As well as dominating on the defensive end, he put up a career-high 20 points, going eight for nine from the field in an efficient offensive performance.
Adding to his career night, Smith had nine rebounds—just one board shy of a triple-double, an especially elusive statistical achievement for a center. The sophomore led both teams in rebounds and blocks on Friday night and was second only to sophomore forward Wesley Saunders in points.
Friday night, Smith was tapped to start for the first time since the Crimson’s loss at the hands of Vermont on Nov. 27.
“I was a little nervous, [having] not started since the beginning of the season,” said Smith after the contest against Penn. “But I just...tried to calm myself down and just focus on playing my game.”
Smith’s focus paid off, as he topped his previous career highs in points, blocks, and rebounds. Throughout the season, Harvard has struggled to find a strong presence inside the paint, which Amaker highlighted as one the factors contributing to Smith’s starts this weekend.
“We have to have a post presence...to be able to put the ball inside at some point, and [Smith is] our best option when it comes to that,” said Amaker following Friday night’s game. “I was incredibly impressed with how he handled it tonight.”
After his performance the night before, Smith found himself in the starting lineup again against the Tigers on Saturday.
In the Crimson’s biggest conference matchup so far this season, the center helped Harvard to a 12-point victory over its Ivy League rival and led the game with seven rebounds and six blocks. Finishing alongside sophomore forward Steve Mondou-Missi with a team-high 14 points, Smith took a total of nine shots—five from the field and four from the line—and sunk them all. Despite playing only 20 minutes, Smith was responsible for each of the Crimson’s six blocked shots.
The victory over the Tigers gave Harvard a valuable edge in the conference standings, and his performance over the weekend earned Smith his first career nod as Ivy League Player of the Week. On the weekend, the sophomore amassed 34 points, 17 blocks, and 16 rebounds. He went 13 for 14 from the field and eight of nine from the line in 51 minutes of play—more than he had played in his last six games combined.
Smith is now second in the Ivy League in blocks per game, despite having played less than half as many minutes as Brown’s league-leading freshman forward Cedric Kuakumensah.
With six Ivy League games left to play for the Crimson—including a rematch against Princeton on the Tigers’ home court—Harvard will likely look to Smith for a continued inside presence as it works towards a title and a tournament bid.
“There’s a lot of basketball still to be played,” said Amaker over the weekend. “Kenyatta was [given] an opportunity and embraced it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There’s no place like home.
After going 3-3-1 since its last home game on Jan. 19, the Harvard women’s hockey team found its groove again at the Bright Hockey Center on Tuesday night. Despite playing with an altered lineup, the squad registered its 18th straight home victory dating back to last year with a 5-2 win over Brown.
Harvard outshot its visitors, 52-16, and drew eight penalties while only committing five infractions.
“Their goaltender played real well but we had a lot of good looks at the net,” Harvard coach Katy Stone said. “I liked our effort—backchecking, forechecking—it was a pretty comprehensive game. We got a lot of new faces in the lineup and that was exciting for us.”
Despite a shuffling of the lineup before the game, the Crimson’s second line continued its hot streak early, scoring the first goal of the game eight minutes into the first period. Down on the red line, freshman Dylanne Crugnale threaded a pass to sophomore Hillary Crowe in the slot, who stood ready to one-time the puck by Brown goalie Katie Jamieson on the farside for a 1-0 lead. Crowe’s goal extended her point streak to a career-high five games.
Crugnale got the assist after being added to the second line when senior Kaitlin Spurling was moved to the top group to replace junior Kalley Armstrong, who missed the game with an injury, though according to Katy Stone, Armstrong’s absence was mainly precautionary.
“Our whole year has been about stepping up, filling spots, and I’m completely confident in any of our forwards to step up when Army gets hurt or I get hurt,” Fry said. “I think [Spurling] did a great job and I think Dylanne did a great job when she came up front.”
The Bears were able to answer Harvard’s opening tally a minute later with a redirection from the slot to tie the game on the team’s second shot.
But after that, Brown would have no response for the remainder of the Crimson’s onslaught.
Harvard broke the tie before the first period was over when junior Lyndsey Fry beat Jamieson on a breakaway. Co-captain Jillian Dempsey earned an assist on the play by intercepting a puck at center ice and flicking it to a streaking Fry.
With the point, Dempsey entered the top ten in points in Harvard history.
“[It is] just unreal to be even mentioned with some of those players,” Dempsey said. “I couldn’t have done it without my teammates throughout the years.”
Though the Crimson entered the first intermission with a 2-1 advantage, the damage could have been worse as Jamieson made 20 saves in the first period. The goalie continued to stand on her head in the second, making 13 stops on 14 shots, including saves on a number of point-blank opportunities. She finished with 47 saves.
“After the first period it was like, ‘Here we have all these shots and we aren’t producing much,’” Fry said. “She’s a big goalie, she’s a strong goalie, and she does a really good job of getting square with the puck so as long as we were shooting at her without anybody in front she was going to make those saves, as she should.”
Several of Jamieson’s second-period stops came while her team was attempting to kill the four penalties it committed in the second period alone. Harvard made the Bears’ job easier by negating multiple man advantages with infractions of its own.
Yet, the Crimson was able to convert one of its power play chances into points. With five minutes left in the frame, freshman Mary Parker made Brown pay for tripping and slashing penalties by gathering a bouncing puck in the crease and shoveling it home while Harvard was on a five-on-three.
Seven seconds into the final period, Fry put her team up, 4-1, by scoring a dagger goal immediately following the opening faceoff.
“Instead of having their wing lined right up against me, they kind of had her pulled back a bit…so that gave me a little more room to go,” Fry said.  “Then I just thought I caught the defense off-guard.”
Spurling added a goal 10 minutes later to give Harvard its second straight five-goal game.
“That’s great,” Stone said. “It’s nice to have offense coming from a lot of different places.”
The Bears tallied a late goal with less than two minutes remaining, but it wasn’t enough to end Brown’s 24-game winless streak against the Crimson that dates back to 2002.

Harvard's men's basketball team is first in the Ivy League, which means we might want to start taking school spirit seriously. But this can be hard. And since I am incredibly qualified to advise other Harvard students how to show some spirit (I did watch all three "Bring It On" movies), here are some tips.
1. Face Paint
Nothing says "I love sports" quite like face paint. You can put it on your cheeks, your chest, or your car to cover up that dent your parents don't know about. If you don't want shell out the cash for crimson face paint, you can get the same red-faced effect by running around for a couple minutes or blushing constantly.
2. Go to a Game
It may sound extreme, but the good news is that you don't have to go for long. Just long enough to snap a selfie of you in your face paint and get interviewed for the next Crimson article. For which you should say "Go Crimson!!!!" Make sure to convey all the exclamation marks. Fans like punctuation.
3. Follow a Player
Find an athlete (preferably a good looking and single one) and become their number one fan. Cheer for them at games, study their statistics and memorize their class schedules. Trust me, this is the closest to socially acceptable stalking that you will ever get.
4. Make a Bet
Put your money where your mouth is; make a bet and suck on a quarter (it's a good source of copper). It's easy. Just find your bookie and put twenty dollars down on the Harvard basketball team, or, if you are playing Roulette, all your chips on Crimson.

On Feb. 6, the Committee on Undergraduate Education discussed a proposal to change the structure of reading and exam periods. Under the proposal, assignments such as final projects and papers would no longer be due during reading period, and instead on specified dates during exam period.
 
As Harvard examines how this would change the last weeks of each semester, Flyby took a look around to see how some other schools handle it.
 
Princeton: Princeton also has a reading period that lasts approximately 10 days, during which faculty can choose to hold class. The last day of their reading period is dubbed "dean's date" and is designated for the " final submission of written work", including papers and projects.
 
And don't forget — unlike Harvard, they have their fall semester finals after winter break.
 
Yale: Though some classes may meet during Yale's weeklong reading period, they aren’t allowed to assign due dates for take-home exams during that period. Instead, the take-home finals are due during the regular exam period.
 
Other final assignments, however, are due during reading period: "It is expected that instructors will require all course assignments, including term papers, to be submitted at the latest by the last day of reading period," the reading period policy reads.
