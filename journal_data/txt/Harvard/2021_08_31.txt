After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a brief contract with Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker’s label, 20-year-old Tampa Bay rapper 2Gaudy is in the midst of a rebrand as an independent artist.
Formerly known as 637godwin, the rapper released his first single “Letterman” under his new name 2Gaudy on Aug 13.
Under his old moniquer 637godwin, the rapper amassed over 25,000 followers on SoundCloud and 190,000 monthly listeners on Spotify with his distinctly melodic brand of rap influenced by the likes of Smino, Trippie Redd and the late Chicago rapper Juice WRLD.
“When I first heard Juice, I got super hooked on his style and the way that he would have lyrics that would either tug at your heartstrings or be really super clever with wordplay,” the rapper said. “That was something I found myself wanting to aspire to be.”
While in high school, the rapper committed to a career in music, teaching himself FL Studio on YouTube and taking a job at a bagel shop to pay for audio equipment. His original rap name was “Godwin” after his legal middle name.
“I learned enough to make songs that people could listen to, like pretty good quality,” he said. “Once I got to that point, it became about me wanting to elevate my lyricism to create songs that can uplift and make people happy.”
Over the last year, the rapper attributes his commercial success to migrating his music from SoundCloud to other streaming services.
“I started putting stuff on Spotify because the majority of my music is on SoundCloud and it doesn't really exactly reach a wider audience — a lot less people have SoundCloud on their phone,” 2Gaudy said.
“I wouldn't say that I've blown up yet though,” he added.
2Gaudy’s most popular song to date, “She Wants It,” written and released last year, has received over 1.3 million streams on SoundCloud and over 11 million plays on Spotify, bolstered by its appearance in several popular Fortnite gaming videos.
Early last year, the rapper’s music and impressive streaming numbers caught the eye of Travis Barker, who expressed interest in signing the rapper after finding him online.
During his introduction to the label, the rapper was informed following an investigation by Barker’s legal team that the name “637godwin” violated two different copyright claims on the three-number sequence “637” and the word “Godwin,” respectively.
“[The legal team] wanted to make sure that no one could come back later and say that I didn't have the rights to my name, also to cover themselves so they wouldn't get sued,” he said. “It turned out I couldn't use the name 637godwin.”
By the beginning of 2021, the combination of the copyright situation and the pandemic had significantly limited the rapper’s ability to collaborate with the label, according to 2Gaudy. The two parties subsequently decided to part ways, but the rapper said he is grateful to Barker and the label for the industry experience.
“They gave me back all my tracks, so I own the rights to my songs and my masters and they let me keep the advance money,” the rapper said. “I really can't complain, all of it is just a learning lesson.”
“To change my name after all this time kind of blows, but it is what it is,” he added.
2Gaudy used the advance money from the label to install a personal studio in his home.
However, the rapper said that the legal red tape associated with being a signed artist and his current copyright-fueled rebrand as 2Gaudy have delayed his release schedule over the last ten months.
“I have probably 300 songs that are unreleased in the vault,” he added. “When you're making content and putting it out, but getting no validation for it eventually over time you’re just like: ‘Why the fuck am I even doing this?’”
The rapper records in his personal studio every day.
While working with Barker’s label, 2Gaudy said that meeting his musical hero Trippie Redd was a personal moment of validation and inspiration that continues to inform his work ethic.
“I was with Travis at his studio and he just called up Trippie Redd and in 15 minutes he was there,” 2Gaudy said. “That blew my fucking mind. Because up until that point, Trippie Redd was the GOAT in my eyes.”
The pair collaborated on an unreleased single after meeting one another. During the studio session for the track, 2Gaudy says the most powerful advice he received from Redd was to “just be yourself.”
As an independent artist, the rapper is excited to leverage the freedom of being unsigned to release content on his own terms. Most importantly, 2Gaudy said that he wants to stay true to himself.
“Music is about more than a trendy song that pops up and takes the internet by storm for a meme,” he said. “What I’m aiming for is a cult following.”
Despite his undeniable commercial success, the rapper shared that he finds the most happiness in playing his music for other people, not making money.
“If I had to stay the same way I am right now financially and everything just to be able to reach more people, I would definitely, definitely do that,” 2Gaudy said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In mid-July, a pair of bus-stop billboards featuring rapper ANKHLEJOHN’s face and name were installed at two locations in the artist’s hometown of Washington D.C.
The ads were part of a Spotify initiative to highlight musicians from the Washington metropolitan area including D.C. MCs like ANKHLEJOHN and DMV artists like Rico Nasty and Ari Lennox.
According to ANKHLEJOHN, being chosen for the ad campaign represented a chance to reach new listeners and strengthen his brand, except for one thing: Spotify misspelled his name on the ad as “AHNKHLEJOHN.”
Rather than take the mistake personally, however, ANKHLEJOHN embraced his partnership with Spotify as an affirmation of years of hard work as an independent artist and validation of his prowess as a lyricist.
“I was just so honored that I got the opportunity to have my face right there,” the rapper said in an interview with The Harvard Crimson. “I was still happy to post it and receive the love from it. I wasn’t embarrassed. It was still a really big moment for me.”
The rapper added that he felt such gratitude f0r the recognition in his hometown that the first sight of the billboard — even though misspelled — brought him to tears.
“I get shown love in real life too,” ANKHLEJOHN said. “Everything is going pretty good. I’m still gonna raise it to a higher level and we still have work to do, but so far it’s been pretty lucrative.”
A few days after discovering the spelling error, ANKHLEJOHN contacted the Spotify team and the billboard was fixed by the beginning of August. The rapper says that he feels nothing but appreciation for the ad placement.
However, the rapper quipped that he may have been better off going by his old rap name “The Golden Child,” after the 1986 Eddie Murphy movie, which is much harder to misspell than ANKHLEJOHN.
Over the past several years, ANKHLEJOHN has established himself as one of the best underground rappers out of D.C., through his high-release output of 90s-inspired mafioso raps with assists from the likes of former Odd Future affiliate Navy Blue, Big Ghost LTD., and Pink Siifu.
On July 30, the rapper released a full-length album with New Jersey MC Da$H and producer LOOK DAMIEN! entitled “Honey Sweeter than Blood.” The project is ANKHLEJOHN’s second collaboration album of the year, following a full length EP with New York MC Rome Streetz released in June.
ANKHLEJOHN said he prefers to work alone but is drawn to collaborate with artists with whom he has a genuine personal connection, like Da$H.
“My stuff came across his radar and he took a liking to it and I linked up on some man shit — we ain’t like those Internet-type n*****,” ANKHLEJOHN said. “We have a lot in common. We’re both new fathers and I've been a fan of bro for a long time. There was just a mutual respect.”
After meeting in person for the first time last year, ANKHLEJOHN said that he was thinking about reaching out to Da$H to make a few songs together when the New Jersey rapper suggested that they make the album that would become “Honey Sweeter than Blood.”
“After the first song was done, we realized we could definitely make classic shit,” he said. “And that's exactly what happened: that first song went on, the second song went on, and then by the third song, we were in motion. He would go in the booth, then I would go in. It was amazing.”
ANKHLEJOHN shared that his greatest source of artistic inspiration is the music of his peers. The rapper’s most frequent collaborators span the Northeast from Da$H in New Jersey to Rome Streetz in New York City to Al.Divino and Estee Nack in Massachusetts and share ANKHLEJOHN’s zealous enthusiasm for boom-bap style raps.
“We all want the same thing,” the rapper said. “Whether you come from Lynn, Massachusetts; Washington D.C.; Richmond; Brooklyn, New York; Los Angeles, California, I mean we all relate in some aspect. We just link up.”
“We’re like The Avengers of this shit,” he added.
The rapper’s 2020 album “As Above So Below” was fully produced by LA-native Navy Blue and features guest verses from Al.divino, Richmond artist Fly Anakin, Brooklyn MC Wiki, and Da$H.
Up until this point in his career, ANKHLEJOHN said that he has primarily relied on his gut instinct for quality to network into other artists and shape his catalogue. Moving forward, the rapper hopes to channel the freedom of being an independent artist into a release schedule that maximizes his product and creativity.
“I’ve been very intuitive and it’s worked for me,” the rapper said. “I might wake up and want to drop a project. Some of my best work has come from that type of attitude, but I know that for the level I’m trying to be at, more planning is necessary for the future.”
Such planning appears to already be in the works with ANKHLEJOHN’s next album “As a Man Thinketh” on deck to release this month. The tracklist includes production credits from heavy-hitters Navy Blue, Nicholas Craven, and Griselda Records collaborator Jay Versace.
The rapper said that he hopes to play a live show at the Middle East Restaurant and Nightclub in Boston in the near future.
