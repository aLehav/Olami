After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Poet, singer, and songwriter Mary Lambert wants to move to Massachusetts. She wants to give everyone in the audience a hug, and she wants a unicorn. After watching her in Sunday night’s performance of “Not Crying on Sundays,” hosted by Radcliffe Union of Students, Queer Students Alliance, and Speak Out Loud, I wanted to give Mary Lambert all of those things.
 
Lambert is best known for writing Macklemore’s “Same Love” in which she is also the featured singer. The song has become an anthem for the BGLTQ movement and, recently, an anthem for opponents of the Defense of Marriage Act. This year, Lambert, along with Macklemore and Ryan Lewis, won the VMA award for Best Music Video with a Social Message.
 
Since the release of “Same Love” in July of 2012, Lambert released a solo album, “Letters Don’t Talk,” and, with the artistic freedom that a fan-base provides, has decided to direct her artistic work towards young activists, queer youth, insecure women, and unlikely fans from all backgrounds. Her lyrics are image-heavy, equal parts devastating and humorous. In her own style of mixed poetry and music, Lambert is able to integrate personal experience with a reassuring message, producing a warm aura on stage. In her spoken word/song called “I Know Girls (Body Love)”—which she performed on Sunday—Lambert implores her listeners to “love your body like your mother loved your baby feet” and “remember the first time you touched someone with the sole purpose of learning all of them.” 
Even with the profound political relevance for which Lambert’s music has become famous, she is incredibly personable and humble in concert. Adorable and quirky don’t quite cover Lambert’s presence—she sat down to her piano in a sparkly, strapless dress that she said she “wore just for us.” Between songs, she repeated how grateful she was to the Harvard students for hosting her.  “I’m also bipolar,” she confessed at the beginning of the concert in a spirit of openness, adding, “You’re welcome.”
After starting on a somewhat depressed note with a poem about her own experience with rape, she turned the mood around by mentioning her love of Massachusetts town names. “Chicopee” seemed to particularly delight her, and after repeating the name in a squeaky voice, she obliged her listeners by fulfilling a request from the audience.
 
“I hear it is someone’s six-month-iversary,” Lambert said, and she proceeded to sing one of her love songs to the couple who had requested it (The piece was “My Moon” from her debut album “Letters Don’t Talk”). Lambert consistently tries to connect with her listeners and be genuine in her themes. Her songs and poems are not just political, and her lyrics are hymns of first love, defeated insecurity, and mental health and body image issues.
 
By the end of the concert, Lambert and a few of the audience members broke her rule—there was some crying on Sunday. It was difficult to tell whether Lambert or the audience were more grateful for the warm atmosphere generated by the successful performance.
 
Lambert sings for those young people whose bodies or sexualities never quite seem to follow what society says is right. The goal of her music is to provide solace from societal struggles with her rich and wonderful voice, and she held true to that value throughout the performance. “We’re perpetually waiting by the phone for someone to pick up and tell us that we did good,” she sang from “(Body Love).” 
“Well, you did good.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Over the past 38 years, there have been a number of “Saturday Night Live” cast members who have served the show well, each bringing their own unique humor and performance style. Unfortunately for viewers, not every longtime player has as few career options as Kenan Thompson. Over the last two years, “SNL” has lost no fewer than five star cast members, including Kristen Wiig, Andy Samberg, Bill Hader, Fred Armisen, and Jason Sudeikis. In the show’s 39th season premiere, “SNL” alum Tina Fey introduced us to an unusually high number of new featured players, six in all. Now that the season is several episodes in, here’s our take on who will stay and who will go.

 
Beck Bennett
Bennett enjoys a bit of exposure in an airport sketch during the premiere. Though his character doesn’t claim any of the biggest laughs of the sketch, he supports it skillfully with his portrayal of an upper-middle class husband along with his more experienced cast-mate Kate McKinnon. Certainly one of the more comfortable freshman performers on stage, he could do very well. He seems malleable and he could enjoy great success in the near future as both an actor and comedian as he develops his comedic style over the coming season. Best case scenario, the fledgling straight man could do well as a Jason Sudeikis replacement.
 
John Milhiser
Milhiser was notably invisible for the entirety of the premiere and his sole appearance in the Miley Cyrus episode is a Jon Cryer impression in the “50 Shades of Grey” sketch. Milhiser is a gifted impressionist but his capacity as a cast member remains to be seen. For his sake, let’s hope he grabs Lorne Michaels’ attention, soon, or he could get taken off the air like last year’s Tim Robinson.
 
Kyle Mooney
Tina Fey calls out Mooney’s “deer in the headlights look” in the “New Cast Member or Arcade Fire” game show sketch. This is likely more intentionally ironic than an accident, since his performances are the most inspired out of the new cast by far. He turns his newcomer status into a real advantage, revealing a self-effacing humor, reminiscent throughout of the always-committed Vanessa Bayer, as he throws himself into his characters. He never wavered in portraying the awkward veteran stand-up comedian character Bruce Chandling on Weekend Update.
 
Michael O'Brien
O’Brien has been an “SNL” writer for the past few years and based on his performance, maybe the writers’ room is where he belongs. Even in the hilarious context of his 1950s try-hard car salesman sketch, O’Brien looks rigid at times. Though he has a few great moments in the sketch along with Tina Fey, his performance feels subpar. Hopefully this can be attributed to nerves; otherwise, he has a ways to go if he wants to grab the interest of the crowd like more confident ex-”SNL” stars such as Hader. Otherwise, he might have to prepare for a very short career as a cast member.
 
Noel Wells
One of the best new additions to the show, Wells’s impersonation of Lena Dunham (as well as of Emma Stone) is stellar. In the “Girls” parody sketch Fey steals the show; however, Wells’s performance holds its own as the duo elicits gut-wrenching laughter from the crowd. She should have no trouble holding—and keeping—America’s attention this year. There’s plenty of room for her to utilize her skills of uncanny character impersonation to reap the same success Will Ferrell did during his time on the show.
 
Brooks Wheelan
Wheelan does a solid job with his meth-head character early on in the show, and his nude scene (yes, he gets naked on his first show) is absolutely hilarious. He certainly holds character well to maximize the punch of that specific joke. If he can throw caution to the wind like Chris Parnell could on a regular basis, he could become one of the most recognizable performers on the show.

The chance to channel your inner Obi Wan Kenobi might be closer than you think. Working within the Harvard Quantum Optics Center and the Harvard-MIT Center for Ultracold Atoms, Harvard professor Mikhail D. Lukin and MIT professor Vladan Vuletic recently led research through which they discovered a new state of matter that behaves similarly to Star Wars lightsabers. Though it’s still in its early stages, the future's looking bright for this new type of light technology.
 
Fifteen Minutes: How did you come to discover this, and how does it work?
 
Mikhail D. Lukin: Quantum theory is by now about a hundred years old, with well established basic principles. Right now, though, what we are trying to do is to not just be able to explain it, but to also control quantum systems, all the way down to individual quanta. This in particular involves control of light at the quantum level. But one of the features of the light field is that if you take two light beams, they just go through each other. What this means is the fundamental quanta of light fields, called photons, do not interact with each other. This work basically addresses the problem of trying to make single photons interact with each other; this is important, for example, for applications such as the processing of information, which is carried by light fields. What we have developed allows us to make single photons interact so strongly that they form a molecule.
 
FM: How is this similar to the famed Star Wars lightsabers?
 
MDL: Basically, the physics behind our observations is similar to what we see in the movies. We created an optical medium such that if you take two faint light beams, consisting of just single photons, they don’t actually just pass through each other, but the photons inside start interacting with each other, or talking to each other, much like massive material particles. This not unlike what we see in the movies, where eventually the light beams behave almost like solid objects. So this analogy is apparently very fascinating.
 
FM: What do you think could be in the future for your discovery?
 
MDL: In the future, there are several directions that we and others are pursuing. One of them is to try to make bigger and more complex objects from photons. The molecules consisting of two photons that we observe can be thought as a kind of new form of matter. We would like to create more complex objects, like,  for example, crystals out of single photons of light. There is also an applied part to this work, because as I mentioned before, photons are the best candidates for carrying information. You can encode information in just one single photon, which makes this transmission perfectly secure: no one can intercept such a message without being detected. What our work does is it shows a way how to actually make the single photons interact with each other, build single photon switches and transistors, and, by that, process the information carried by light fields. And that is one of the frontiers of modern technology, because it can be used in the development of quantum computers and quantum communication systems.

It’s October, which means your average Harvard students is watching the baseball playoffs or cramming for four midterms–unless you’re a sophomore, in which case you’re probably freaking out about having to declare your concentration by mid-November (or even sooner for some programs). 
To help you avoid picking the wrong one, Flyby compiled a cheat sheet detailing some possible areas of study.
1. Folklore and Mythology
We’re sure that someone has told you, “You’re graduating with a degree from Harvard, so all you need to do is pass!” If you really want to test that advice, this is the concentration for you. We dare you to find something less applicable to the professional world.
2. English/Comparative Literature
We know that these are separate concentrations, but stop trying to explain the difference between the two and go back to reading that book. These concentrations are perfect if you can’t stand desks or p-sets. Find a comfortable chair (a deep-red leather if you want to complete the intellectual look), forget how to count past 20, and enjoy your books. (Caveat: This should be pretty obvious, but to be an English concentrator, you ought to own a tweed blazer or two.)
3. Computer Science
You’re at Harvard, so you probably didn’t have a crazy social life in high school—why start now? Fridays, Saturdays, and fun are overrated anyway. Your skillset will be in high demand when you graduate and having a steady, prosperous job might do wonders for your social life after you turn 30.
4. Economics
Oh, how’s the season going? Looking to go into consulting/finance/i-banking/whatever else Harvard kids do when they sell out? Original.
5. Government 
This is a great choice if you want to do anything like law or public policy, or just make other people feel bad about their résumés. “Oh, you scoop ice cream during the summer? That’s so cool. Yeah, I just did a little bit of work with Joe Biden this summer.” “Oh, him? Yeah, Joe introduced me once or twice.” Or at least, that’s what you tell yourself.
6. Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology or Organismic and Evolutionary Biology
This basically applies to any biology concentration with more than one word preceding the “biology”: Do less. Do a lot less. You don’t get bonus points for having a concentration with a longer name. Also, reconsider any major involving the word “organismic.”
In sum, there are exactly zero concentrations safe from ridicule. Here’s what you should actually do: Pick your concentration, and don’t start a single conversation in the next three weeks with ANYTHING related to your newly chosen academic path. Your friends will thank you for it.
