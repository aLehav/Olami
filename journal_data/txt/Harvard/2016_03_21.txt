“ShadrachSmith” is a mysterious commenter active in the comment sections of student publications across the Ivy League. He or she has made 21,286 comments since the creation of the account on April 12, 2010. ShadrachSmith’s comments can sometimes veer towards the offensive, and a fair number of them are not pertinent to the content of the articles. Here, we have picked out for your convenience a few of ShadrachSmith’s recent contributions in the comments section of The Harvard Crimson.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Our last day in London was cold and wet. Still, I didn’t want to leave.
It’s not just the tea there (much better), or the number of streets and landmarks referenced in T.S. Eliot poems (much higher). It’s not the way things don’t go wrong in the United Kingdom but instead “go pear-shaped”—and, when they go just right, “Bob’s your uncle!” It’s not even the hats.
Though England’s charming conventions, tasty treats, and huge amount of history endear its capital to me, they’re not enough. In fact, the real reason my spring break trip made me more serious than ever about hopping across on a semi-permanent basis has less to do with where I’d be going to than where I’d be coming from: As much as I’m an Anglophile, I’m worried I’m also starting to become an Ameriphobe.
Don’t get me wrong. I love the United States, from the national anthem to baseball to listening to the national anthem before watching baseball—which, embarrassingly enough, always gets me teary-eyed. Cricket and “God Save the Queen” could never do it for me. And forget monarchies; our system of democracy fascinates me so much I used to carry a copy of the Constitution in my pocket.
Washington, D.C. looks nothing like Maine, which looks nothing like Nevada, which looks nothing like the Californian coast. The people across the country are as varied as the landscape, not only in the nation’s biggest cities. That’s a sign of something else: Being American, to most people, often means being a whole mix of things, and it never means looking just one way. For all the United States’ problems—and there are lots of problems—the inclusive concept at the country’s core holds up.
But when Donald Trump promises to “make America great again,” he’s tearing down the very things that make America great already. Under the guise of countering political over-correctness, he’s not only throwing civility out the window but also channeling a kind of bigotry the U.S. hasn’t seen in the political mainstream for generations. The melting pot, in Trump’s America, would turn into a boiling pot, and the very people the nation was built to welcome would get poached.
The Constitution isn’t safe, either. Trump’s not alone in stomping all over it: The Republican Senate has vowed not to confirm any nominee President Obama puts forth for the Supreme Court vacancy—not even the centrist he’s chosen for the nod.
Even if Trump doesn’t win the Republican nomination, much less the general election, droves of Trumpeters have made their way to the ballot box over the past few months. The xenophobic, authoritarian culture Trump has produced and promoted is potent, and it’s terrifying. Up against this America, a life of buttered scones and crumpets looks particularly rosy.
And this is coming from someone who, compared to some, doesn’t have a lot to lose under a Trumpian regime: Trump is no feminist, but most of the time, the hate he spews isn’t directed at me. I doubt I’m the only one itching to escape, and I suspect many of the others have stronger grounds to fear what’s happening at home.
Maybe I’m being cowardly. Maybe running away from America’s problems is just as bad as running away from my own. In the end, some combination of inertia, obligation, and that stubborn love of baseball will probably keep me in town. But for soon-to-be graduates and other 20-somethings who do decide to get away, the years before they’ve really settled down should be an easier time than any to pack up. It’s not so unreasonable a choice for young Americans who, in a country that day by day looks less and less like America, are starting to mind the gap.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Shortly before spring break, the gender-neutral sign on a single-stall restroom in Eliot House was vandalized. On Facebook, an Eliot House resident posted on an image of the sign, which had been torn to reveal the word “men” painted in black underneath. This incident precipitated outrage online and a response from Eliot Faculty Dean Gail O’Keefe, who emailed Eliot House residents saying the administration would investigate and that vandalism would not be tolerated.
Led by Adams House, some Houses began replacing gender-specific restrooms with gender-neutral ones in early September. According to the Adams House resident dean, the restrooms were explicitly labeled gender-neutral to make them “actively welcoming” for people of all gender identities. The gender-neutral restroom in Eliot was also explicitly labeled as gender-neutral.
The vandalism of the gender-neutral restroom in Eliot is indicative of systemic transphobia on Harvard campus. The destruction of a gender-neutral sign was the symbolic reclamation of an exclusive space that had been made more inclusive and accessible. We are disturbed by this act, and we are disappointed that the administration has not responded publicly. The email from O’Keefe was only sent to Eliot House residents. A message from the administration should be sent to the entire College. It is imperative that administrators voice their support for queer and transgender students and reaffirm the College’s commitment to expanding gender-neutral restrooms as essential for the safety of marginalized community members.
The need for gender-neutral restrooms is profound, and their expansion is long overdue. Gender-neutral restrooms are critical for the safety and well-being of BGLTQ students, and it is vital that they are installed more widely throughout campus. While it is commendable that some of the Houses have started to implement gender-neutral restrooms, single-gender bathrooms are the majority, especially in residential buildings. The process by which students can petition for gender-neutral restrooms in their dorms remains inconsistent and opaque. Additionally, very few gender-neutral restrooms exist in academic buildings.
The administration should standardize the procedure to proliferate the number of gender-neutral restrooms on campus, and they should also make the introduction of gender-neutral restrooms a top priority in House renovations. Harvard can also make progress immediately. There is no compelling reason for single-stall bathrooms to be gender-specific. The administration should make all single-stall bathrooms gender-neutral and in this way provide safer and more inclusive spaces for all of its students.
It is of the utmost importance that Harvard treat students of all genders with equal respect. Indeed, the Department of Justice has ruled that preventing transgender persons from using bathrooms that aligns with their gender identity constitutes discrimination. Using the restroom is a basic necessity, and access to safe restroom facilities is essential to upholding all students’ dignity. The administration must reject the transphobia so evident in the incident at Eliot House and deliver BGTLQ students the safety they need and deserve.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“We gon’ be alright. We gon’ be alright. Do you hear me? Do you feel me? We gon’ be alright.”
When Compton rapper Kendrick Lamar decided to make this the chorus of his 2015 song “Alright,” I wonder if he could have imagined the remarkable impact that it would have beyond the confines of the music industry. In addition to earning Lamar a Grammy last month, “Alright” has emerged as an unofficial anthem for social justice protests around the country over the past year.
Whether in protest of police brutality in Cleveland, or during struggles for inclusion at institutions of higher learning where exclusionary legacies linger, or, as happened recently, at a rally in Chicago in protest of a certain front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, “We gon’ be alright” has assumed a symbolic place in the hearts and minds of young activists across the country.
As a native of Southern California and longtime fan of Kendrick Lamar, I am ecstatic that this song, with its unbridled celebration of blackness, has seamlessly become a source of strength for many who are fighting legacies of oppression and looking to move their communities and this country forward.
And yet, for all the positive energy that “Alright” has provided for black Americans across the country, there are certain voices in the media that criticize Lamar’s song and other hip-hop songs like it for being responsible for various issues in black communities, such as the deep tensions that exist between communities of color and the police.
In particular, commentators seem to have taken an issue with the full refrain, which reads, “Wouldn’t you know, we been hurt, been down before. When our pride was low, looking at the world like, 'Where do we go?' And we hate po-po, wanna kill us dead in the street fo’ sho’. I’m at the preacher’s door, my knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow but we gon’ be alright.” 
Let’s get one thing clear: Hip-hop is not the cause of tensions between black communities and the police. There is only one cause—the systematic abuse and killing of unarmed black men, women, and children by the police, an issue that has only recently reentered the public consciousness due to the advent of cell phone footage.
When brothers and sisters and sons and daughters don’t come home again and again, their bodies riddled with bullets, their pockets empty, their skin a shade too dark, it is in this moment that distraught communities find strength in the words of a young Compton rapper, one who speaks to that very same experience because he lived it himself.
The person who hears Kendrick’s words and walks away solely with a message that advocates violence against the police is terribly mistaken. This is a song about hope. This is a song crafted to carry a special message to communities of color struggling against police brutality across the country through a celebration of the remarkable legacy of survival that defines the history of African-Americans in America.
With “Alright,” Lamar reminds black Americans that yes, we’ve been hurt and down before and yes, the struggle against structural racism and the problems it has produced continues. But we gon’ be alright, he says, because if African-Americans have survived what they’ve been through before, they will continue to survive in America. In essence, “Alright” functions as a tool of healing for communities that have been affected by the violence, both physical and psychological, that America’s criminal justice system inflicts each and every day.
That a song like “Alright” is functioning as a healing mechanism is not a new phenomenon. Along with the cold, harsh clanking of chains on the feet of black slaves, one could also hear the beautiful sounds of Negro spirituals. Every tone, as Frederick Douglass once wrote so eloquently, was “a testimony against slavery, and a prayer to God for deliverance from chains.” Invoking the memory of the ancient Israelites’ bondage, the souls of these black folk would sing, “One more river to cross!” And during the struggle for civil rights in the twentieth century, when black Americans found themselves facing the piercing sounds of high-pressure water hoses and vicious dogs, they found a way to drown out those noises with the angelic sounds of gospel and soul music: “A change gonna come!”
Today, as people of color and their allies find themselves engaged in a struggle against systemic racism in every corner of our criminal justice system, behind every harrowing bullet fired from a police holster, comes the healing power of these words, “We gon’ be alright!”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority fiscal control board voted on March 7 to increase its fares starting this July, a move with potentially negative consequences for Harvard affiliates.
The decision—which the board made amid loud chants of “fight the hike” from protesters who interrupted the meeting—came on the heels of the MBTA’s recent proposal to cut late-night weekend service, a change likely to disproportionately affect the Harvard Square T stop more than other MBTA stations. The MBTA  voted to carry out this plan on March 16.
The price revisions, slated to take effect in July, include increasing the cost of riding the T with a CharlieCard from $2.10 to $2.25 and with a CharlieTicket from $2.65 to $2.75. The cost to ride the bus with a CharlieCard will rise from $1.60 to $1.70.
Dalen L. Ferreira ’19, who said he uses public transportation at least once a week, described the fare increase as “annoying” but not disastrous.
“I may not get to ride as often as I like, but I hope it won’t affect me too much,” he said.
The MBTA estimates that the fare hike will yield roughly $43 million in new revenue in fiscal year 2017. After the vote, fiscal control board chairman Joseph Aiello said the MBTA hopes to use the money to improve service.
Charles Chieppo, a Kennedy School fellow at the Ash Center who previously served on the MBTA’s Blue Ribbon Committee on Forward Funding, had a slightly different take.
“They’re doing it because they’re bankrupt, that’s pretty much what it comes down to,” he said.
Chieppo, who recently authored a report outlining steps the MBTA should take to increase ridership and reduce operating costs, said he was unsure whether or not the fare hike will lead to improved service, as the MBTA projects. He expressed certainty, however, that “people that don’t have a lot of disposable income” were most likely to suffer from the price increase.
Gene A. Corbin, assistant dean of student life for public service and manager of Harvard College’s Phillips Brooks House, agreed.
“Our larger concern is how these increases and costs will impact working families that we [at Phillips Brooks House] serve in the community,” he said. The Phillips Brooks House is the organization that supports public service efforts at Harvard College, including the student-run Phillips Brooks House Association.
Corbin said that the fare hike will likely have a “small impact” in increasing transportation costs for student-led service programs whose members must frequently travel into Boston, but termed the price increase “nothing that we cannot overcome.”

The Boston Redevelopment Authority voted unanimously on Thursday to approve Harvard’s plans for the Life Lab, a biotechnology research and entrepreneurial facility scheduled to open in Allston this fall.
The board of directors of the BRA—Boston’s urban planning agency—approved the Life Lab at their meeting as one of a slew of seven projects that together represent an investment of $285.5 million and will create more 530 construction jobs. The Life Lab alone is projected to cost $17 million and generate 13 jobs.
The Life Lab will feature 36 lab benches, fume hoods, tissue culture and microscopy facilities, a private faculty-in-residence lab suite, conference rooms, and co-working spaces to support team planning. The two-story, 15,000-square-foot facility is slated for construction on Western Ave., in the parking lot directly west of the four-year old affiliated Harvard Innovation Lab. 
"We are very excited to have received the approval from the BRA to begin construction on the Harvard Life Lab,” Jodi Goldstein, the director of the Harvard Innovation Lab, said in a press release. “This project is a pivotal step in making Allston one of the most robust startup communities in the region.”
Harvard spokesperson Annie Tomasini and Business School Chief of Operations Andrew F. O’Brien led the University’s presentation to the BRA on Thursday evening, describing the Life Lab’s layout, intended function, and accompanying community benefits package.
“It is a pilot project, we want to see if we can develop this building adjacent to the i-lab and see how productive we can be in accelerating the startup of these life science businesses,” O’Brien said in his concluding remarks to the board.
Though most aspects of the Life Lab were not contentious, board member and former President of the Boston Architectural College Theodore C. Landsmark raised concerns over the planned building’s exterior design. In a pointed exchange with O’Brien, Landsmark asked for assurance that the first iteration of the Life Lab, an interim facility intended to operate for five to 10 years before moving to a more permanent location, would not look like a “trailer.”
“I would just suggest to you that, given that the Mayor and this agency have asked for as much innovation in design as possible, [and] particularly given that the program of this 15,000-square facility is about generating innovation and entrepreneurship, that the buildings you generate in the future… be equally innovative as the work that is proposed to go on within [them],” Landsmark said.
University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke declined to comment on Landsmark's concern.

In the midst of an unusual election cycle, this year's candidates for Harvard’s Board of Overseers completed questionnaires about race-based affirmative action, revealing widespread support for more transparency in Harvard’s admissions process.
The questionnaires, distributed by a consortium of 10 alumni organizations, surveyed the candidates on transparency in admissions and the importance of student diversity—topics that have garnered attention in an unusually contentious Overseers election.
In January, a group of five alumni running under the slogan “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard” began collecting petition signatures to earn a spot on the ballot for the University’s second highest governing body. Ron K. Unz ’83 has organized and five-time presidential candidate Ralph Nader has headlined their twofold agenda to abolish undergraduate tuition and make public more data about Harvard’s admissions practices, which are currently the subject of legal scrutiny. Their group will appear on the ballot, mailed to alumni by April 1, alongside eight candidates nominated by the Harvard Alumni Association. 

“Our understanding is the [“Free Harvard, Fair Harvard” candidates] didn’t share the same opinions, and it would be incorrect for us to consider them as having a monolithic viewpoint,” Mukesh Prasad ’93, a leader in both the South Asian and Asian American alumni groups who helped distribute the survey, said. “Likewise, it would be wrong of us to assume that all eight of the Harvard Alumni Association candidates did not share any of those same viewpoints as the slate.”
All of the HAA nominees who answered the survey questions expressed support for affirmative action and race-conscious admissions policies.
Karen F. Green ’78, an HAA-nominated candidate, said she supports affirmative action and disagrees with the “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard” platform.
“I believe Harvard should continue to take race into account just as it takes other factors into account, like ethnic and socioeconomic background and particular talents people bring to the classroom,” Green said.
Four of the eight HAA nominees also voiced support for some degree of more transparency in admissions, a principal tenet of the “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard” campaign.
“I am a social scientist, and I believe in the transformational power of data, information, and communication. I agree that Harvard could be more transparent about its admissions process,” P. Lindsay Chase-Lansdale ’74, an HAA candidate, wrote in her survey response.
But other HAA candidates, including Green, argued that Harvard’s admissions department is already sufficiently transparent.
The outsider candidates, however, unanimously agreed that Harvard should be more transparent in its admissions processes, but diverged in their opinions on affirmative action and race-conscious admissions more generally. In his questionnaire response, Unz wrote that he personally opposed affirmative action and has “serious doubts about the value of ‘diversity’ for its own sake,” while Nader wrote that he “strongly” supports both affirmative action and “reparations for African Americans.”
The “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard,” group has repeatedly faced pushback, with some critics calling their platform a bait-and-switch attempt to torpedo Harvard’s affirmative action admissions policies.
In an interview, Unz said he believes the questionnaires revealed more agreement than disparity between his slate and what he called the “mainstream” candidates.
“Probably the candidates running with me are less supportive of diversity and affirmative action, but if you look at the statements, it isn’t a huge difference in positions that they’re taking,” he said.
Some of the outside candidates called into question the integrity of the questionnaires, saying that some of the alumni groups who organized the survey seemed to have already made up their mind about the candidates before even reading their answers.
Lee C. Cheng ’93, one of the “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard” candidates, took issue with the way the Coalition for a Diverse Harvard has characterized his and his group’s views as being against affirmative action. He also said that he questioned the “good faith” nature of the survey when the Coalition for a Diverse Harvard, one of the participating alumni groups, had already expressed its disdain for his slate.
Stuart S. Taylor Jr., a Harvard Law School alumnus and another petition candidate, said he appreciated the opportunity to answer the questions in a consolidated format. Outside of collecting the signatures for his candidacy, Taylor said the few hours he spent answering the survey has been the most time intensive part of the campaign.
“There hasn’t been a whole lot for me to do,” Taylor said. “I’m not getting up every morning and thinking what can I do to get elected to the Harvard Overseers. I’m not sure what I would do if that were a high priority for me.”
Kentaji B. Jackson ’92 declined to complete the survey, citing her position as a federal judge who could potentially rule on affirmative action in higher education.

Owen A. Labrie, who was expected to be a member of the College’s Class of 2018 before he was accused of sexual assault, was arrested Friday for breaking his court-imposed curfew.
Labrie, now 20, was accused of raping a then-15 year-old girl at the prestigious St. Paul’s School in New Hampshire two years ago, as part of a tradition known as the “senior salute.” He was acquitted of felony sexual assault charges but found guilty in August 2015 of multiple misdemeanors and one felony charge of using a computer to solicit a minor.
Labrie was out on a $15,000 bail and had to abide by a curfew that required him to be home between 5 p.m. and 8 a.m. every day.
Judge Larry M. Smukler of the Merrimack Superior Court in Concord, N.H., revoked the bail Friday and sentenced Labrie to one year in the Merrimack County House of Corrections. Labrie could serve only eight months of his 12-month sentence but will have to register as a sex offender if he loses his appeal.
Officials began investigating Labrie after reporter Susan Zalkind saw him on a train in Boston last month, later writing about their conversation on Vice.
Labrie’s lawyer, Jaye L. Rancourt, wrote in her objections to the court that Labrie did follow the curfew, but only broke it for classes and visitations with his attorneys J.W. Carney and Sam Zaganjori. Rancourt also said Zalkind “accosted” Labrie on the train but David Marek, a spokesperson for Vice Media, denied the claims.
Harvey A. Silverglate, a longtime Cambridge lawyer who has advised Harvard students in proceedings with the Administrative Board, said he disagreed with Smukler’s ruling.
“I think it’s a hypertechnical violation that shouldn’t have been the subject of a revocation," he said, saying he thought Labrie posed no danger to anyone when violating his curfew.
Silverglate also said Labrie should have taken the terms of his release on bail more seriously, especially since Silverglate thinks Labrie has a chance of winning his appeal.
“He was a fool for getting himself into a position where he could end up serving all or most of the sentence before the appeal is decided,” Silverglate said. “He might have avoided the jail sentence altogether.”
Labrie was accepted to the College’s Class of 2018. Though Harvard has not confirmed whether it rescinded his admission or he withdrew his application, Labrie did not enroll.
Labrie’s lawyers and Merrimack Court officials could not be reached for comment Sunday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After 45 years of working in the Cambridge City government, City Manager Richard C. Rossi announced his intent to retire in June. The seasoned Cambridge veteran served three years in the position.
According to Rossi, he and the Cambridge City Council met earlier this March to discuss the extension of his three-year contract. At the meeting, Rossi informed the council of his desire to retire “after a long period of thought and discussion.” He announced his retirement officially in a statement addressed to the City Council’s Government Operations, Rules, and Claims Committee on March 11.
“For me it’s a career decision, which was quite difficult and painful for me to make, but finally I did make it,” Rossi said in an interview.
The city manager position, arguably the most powerful in the city, carries great influence in Cambridge. As the chief executive of the city government, the city manager is responsible for enforcing laws and ordinances, advising the City Council and implementing their decisions, appointing city officials, and crafting the city budget.
The decision to retire was difficult, Rossi said, in part because he has worked for Cambridge for more than four decades.
“I have worked for the city for 45 years. I’ve been city manager for the past three, and I’ve been deputy city manager for 32 years prior to that,” Rossi said. He also served as acting director of the Water Department and acting commissioner of public works during his tenure with the city government.
Rossi said he believes his ability to work with his office to serve the residents of Cambridge as best he can has made his time as city manager effective.
“We have an incredibly talented and competent team of public officials,” Rossi said. “This is an outstanding city that is far and ahead the best in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.”
City officials praised Rossi for his work bringing organized lobbyists and community members together during his term as city manager.
“I think there were a lot of things that I think people were really dissatisfied with when he came in,” Councillor Nadeem A. Mazen said. “I think the city manager did a good job in slowly moving to the point where both groups can get what they want.”
In his final few months, Rossi said he will propose the budget for the 2017 fiscal year to the City Council and continue work on initiatives in STEAM programming and early-childhood education.
“I’m working closely with my staff to make sure they are on top of all of the goals we have set out to have accomplished,” Rossi said.
The task of appointing of a new city manager rests solely with the Cambridge City Council, as outlined in the Council’s rules. However, choosing a new City Manager has, until recently, been a rare job for the City Council. Prior to Rossi’s appointment in late 2012, Robert W. Healy, served as city manager for a historic 31 years. A City Council committee will meet on March 23 to create an outline for the new search process, according to Rossi.
“The city manager is the singular most important role,” said Mazen. “It is the decision that defines a city councillors’ role.”
While no plans for selecting a successor have been finalized, Councillor Craig A. Kelley said that the process will be a national search, and may include a private consulting firm to aid the Council as was the case in 2012.
“I would suspect that we would look toward the employees to find out what they would be looking for in a potential boss,” said Kelley. “My belief is that what we’ll do is that we’ll hire a consulting company of some sort to help set up an advertisement.”
Kelley cast the one dissenting vote against the appointment of Rossi in 2012, objecting to the process by which the decision was made. This year, this selection will be “longer and be more extensive” than the 2012 undertaking, Kelley said.
While Rossi’s contract ends in June, the City Council requested that he remain involved in the government should a successor not be found before the contract deadline. Rossi said he intends to stay on as long as needed to facilitate an “orderly transition.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Uber and Lyft may have gained some new customers from Harvard this week. March 18 marked the end of late night service on the T, a popular option for students who frequent downtown Boston or MIT on weekends.
The Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority voted unanimously to cut late night T service on weekends in February. The cuts officially end T service after midnight on Friday and Saturday nights. Previously, the T ceased operation at 2:00 a.m. on weekends.
Despite the news, Harvard undergraduates said they were either unaware or ambivalent about the change, lamenting the loss of service but showing no signs of changing their weekend plans.
“I feel like plenty of people will just not bother changing their own plans,” Dalen L. Ferreira ’19 said. “A lot of people wouldn’t mind walking back and forth from MIT to here.”
In the face of the cuts, students said without the T they would instead use resort to ride sharing services after midnight on weekends.
“I guess some people who are going into Boston late at night will resort to Uber anyway,” Marie C. Becker ’18 said. “Personally, I don’t feel affected by it and I don’t think most Harvard students do.”
“I’d probably start Ubering,” Makeda V. Daniel ’19 said. “It wouldn’t stop me from going out.”
The changes stand to disproportionately affect the Harvard Square T stop compared to other stations. An MBTA report from last February found Harvard Square was the fourth busiest station during late night hours.
Ferreira worried that the cuts may create difficulty for students getting back from school vacations.
“People are getting back in tonight from South Station, how are they going to get back?” Ferreira said.
Before cuts, students had the option of riding the Silver Line from Logan Airport and taking the Red Line from Amtrak at South Station at late hours on weekends.
Nick S. Morihisa ’18 raised worries about visiting friends who live off campus.
Students expressed concern in January after the MBTA announced the possibility of cuts, citing expensive Uber and Lyft rides. Yet, for city officials and residents, the primary concern was not for college students but rather for low-income workers who may be affected by the cuts.
Late night cuts, a fare increase and other money saving measures have decreased the MBTA’s projected budget for the 2017 fiscal year to a $134 million deficit, reflecting more than $104 million in cost cuts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The once-pervasive Harvard Law School seal, criticized for its ties to slavery, is quickly disappearing.
After the Harvard Corporation granted the Law School permission last week to discard its contentious seal, the school now faces the practical implications of a major branding change: the extensive process of physically removing all traces of the image from its campus and websites by the end of April.
Until last week, the controversial crest featuring three sheaves of wheat was everywhere. It adorned the school’s doors, chairs, apparel, letterheads, web pages, social media avatars, and the large crimson banners that typically serve as the backdrop to each graduating class’ commencement ceremony.
Almost immediately after the Corporation’s decision, the school changed its profile image on social media accounts, including Twitter, from the seal to the bolded words “Harvard Law.” Paper cut-outs of the the “Veritas” seal, the emblem representing the whole University, are now taped over spots on the student center doors where the crest used to be, and the school hopes to finish removing the seal from buildings by the end of this week. And,the school’s apparel store, the Coop, will stop ordering new merchandise featuring the old seal.
The crest belonged to the Royall family, prominent slaveholders who helped endow the first law professorship at Harvard more than 200 years ago. The student group Royall Must Fall began calling for the seal’s removal last fall, and Law School Dean Martha L. Minow created a committee in late November to reconsider its use. The committee released a report to the Corporation in early March requesting to change it, a recommendation the Corporation approved last week.
The Law School is now turning to the logistical challenge of excising itself from the seal. Rohit Deshpande, a Harvard Business School professor and marketing specialist, said logo changes of this scale are rare because of the expense. Law School spokesperson Robb London said he did not have a cost estimate for the change.
When changes like this do occur, Deshpande said, the best branding strategy is to execute them rapidly.
“What they’re trying to do is maintain or create loyalty to the brand, so they want to do this fairly quickly,” Deshpande said.
Quickly is exactly how Law School Dean for Administration Francis X. McCrossan—who is leading the effort to coordinate the seal’s removal—is approaching the process, he wrote in an email sent to school affiliates Friday.
London estimates there are about 200 places on campus that display the seal, a figure that does not include its online manifestations and the printed materials and letterhead departments and administrators use.
In his email Friday, McCrossan said the school’s Facilities Office is working to remove or cover up the seal on all buildings this week. The Communications Office has already removed the seal from the school’s official social media pages, and is tasked with re-configuring the school’s web-pages by the end of April.
In the email, McCrossan requests that departments and programs cease using print materials featuring the seal, directing them to the Communications Office to order replacements. He also asks people who have removed seals themselves to return them for potential use in an exhibit about the Royall family in the future.
The school has also asked vendors to stop producing merchandise displaying the seal and requested that the University’s Office of Trademark Programs no longer approve product designs containing the image.
While the Law School Coop will stop ordering new merchandise with the seal, Coop president Jerry Murphy said the store will sell the rest of its inventory, meaning that the seal will not disappear from the the Coop’s racks immediately. Murphy predicts that demand for merchandise bearing the seal will increase as it becomes a rare commodity.
“It becomes more valuable now because people know it’s going away, so they want to buy it,” he said.
London said he does not anticipate the change impacting the school’s ongoing capital campaign. Because donors to educational institutions typically identify more with the name of the school than with its logo, Deshpande said, a logo change is  unlikely to hurt fundraising efforts.
A new seal will be designed in time for the school’s bicentennial in 2017, which London called an opportunity for reflection. “There's a natural synergy between that kind of reflection and the process of designing a new symbol for the school,” he wrote.
Deshpande said that from a marketing standpoint, the school’s decision to time the rollout of a new seal with the bicentennial is smart. “They’re putting a positive interpretation on it, because the bicentennial is a time of celebration,” he said. “It’s a very smart time to do it, so it’s less of an apology for history and a slaveholder image, and more of looking forward to the school and [its] third century.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
LAKE PLACID, N.Y. — The No. 9/9 Harvard men's hockey team has received the third seed in the Northeast Regional of the NCAA tournament. The 16-team field was announced Sunday afternoon, and it pins the Crimson against No. 5/4 Boston College on Friday night (8 p.m.) at the DCU Center in Worcester, Mass.
The winner will play either No. 3/3 Providence or No. 16/15 Minnesota Duluth in the regional championship game on Saturday with a trip to the Frozen Four in Tampa, Fla., on the line.
Harvard has squared off against the Eagles once already this year. The two sides met in the opening round of the Beanpot—a game won, 3-2, by Boston College.
Elsewhere in the field, No. 1/1 Quinnipiac earned the top overall seed and will play in the East Regional in Albany, N.Y. No. 10/11 Yale earned the third seed in the same region, meaning that the two sides could potentially square off in an all-ECAC regional final on Saturday.
Meanwhile, all four Beanpot particpants made the tournament, making up 25 percent of the entire field. No. 11/10 Boston University will play in the West Regional in St. Paul, Minn., while No. 14/14 Northeastern will play in the Midwest Regional in Cincinnati, Ohio.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a three-week break, the No. 49 Harvard men’s tennis team (10-8) returned to the courts this past weekend in San Diego, CA., for the Hilton San Diego Mission Valley Spring Classic. Entering the tournament at the No. 6 seed, the Crimson took on No. 34 San Diego (11-7), No. 46 Denver (10-6), and No. 75 San Diego State (5-9).
Harvard ended the weekend with two losses and a decisive victory on Sunday against San Diego State.
“Overall, though the results weren't always the best, we all started to improve,” freshman Christopher Morrow said. “It was really useful to play outdoor tennis. We can take our win on the last day into those matches and we are all confident of finishing the season strongly.”
HARVARD 4, SAN DIEGO STATE 1
The freshman duo of Morrow and Andy Zhou got things started for the Crimson on Saturday with an early 6-1 victory at third doubles. Co-captain Nicky Hu and junior Brian Yeung sealed the doubles point for Harvard, defeating their Aztecs opponents, 7-5.
With two matches still in process, three singles wins solidified the win for the Crimson. Three After an early loss in the first set, sophomore Kenny Tao came back to decisively take his next two sets for a win at third singles. Yeung followed suit, giving the Crimson the four points needed for victory. He earned his second victory of the day at fourth singles. Eking out a lead with a tiebreaker victory, he took the second set 6-4. Zhou defeated his opponent 6-2, 6-1 at fifth singles, giving the Crimson the four points needed for victory.
The Crimson’s only loss came at second singles, where co-captain Sebastian Beltrame fell to his opponent 6-3, 6-4.
“We have been slightly down, so it was nice to finally get a win over a good team,” Tao said. “I think everyone played well, and we're dangerous when that happens. Hopefully we can maintain that going into Ivy play.”
DENVER 4, HARVARD 3
On Friday, the Crimson was unable to come back from an early deficit. Splitting the singles points 3-3, Denver’s sweeping victories at second and third doubles boosted them over Harvard.
In one of the closest matches of the weekend, Yeung won a second-set tiebreaker after losing the first set. But the second set victory wasn’t enough for a win, as he ultimately fell in a tight third set.
Harvard’s victories of the day all came in three-set matches. At first singles, Hu took the first set 6-3, but fell 6-3 in the second. He was able to recover, however, and earned a win in the third set.
At third singles, Tao came back from a 6-3 loss in the first set to dominate his opponent 6-0, 6-1 in the next two sets.
Tao won two of his three matches this weekend.
“I was pretty happen to win a few matches at the three spot,” Tao said. “I guess it’s kind of a confidence boost for me personally to know I can hang in there with the better players.”
The final win of the day came from Morrow at sixth singles. After splitting the first two sets, Morrow found himself at a 4-0 disadvantage in the third set. But the rookie managed to come back and win the third set.
“I just tried to restart and put as many balls into play as possible,” Morrow said. “I felt like I started to do that really well and thankfully it was enough to come back and win.”
SAN DIEGO 4, HARVARD 1
In the first match of the tournament, Harvard came out strong to win the doubles point. Going 1-1 at second and third doubles, Hu and Yeung, playing first doubles, managed to close out their match 6-4 for a point for the Crimson.
But Harvard was unable to overcome the Toreros in the singles competition, losing all its matches in straight sets. At first and second singles, Hu and Beltrame took two ranked opponents: No. 26 ranked San Diego senior Uros Petronijevic and No. 53 Toreros senior Jordan Angus, respectively.
Both matches went into the third set, but went unfinished due to Harvard’s losses across the rest of the ladder.
“On the first couple of days as a team we didn't commit to our games enough and didn't play enough points in the way we wanted to,” Morrow said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Harvard wrestling stepped onto the mat one final time this season as seniors Devon Gobbo and Todd Preston, as well as sophomore Josef Johnson, represented the Crimson on college wrestling’s biggest stage, the NCAA tournament hosted at Madison Square Garden this weekend. While the three fell short of podium appearances, Gobbo, the newly crowned EIWA champion, managed to stay alive into the second day of competition, coming one match short of an All-American title.
“Looking back on the weekend as a whole, things definitely didn’t go the way we had planned, or the way we had hoped,” Johnson said. “But the main thing I’m going to reflect on after this is how we all pushed each other to get better. We accomplished so much throughout this season, and this weekend didn’t take away from that.”
In the first few moments of his first career appearance at NCAAs, Johnson managed to get the crowd on its feet as he took a successful shot at Penn State’s Bo Nickal, the No. 1 seed and the eventual second place finisher. Johnson caught Nickal off guard, and managed to get himself on the board before the favored 174 lbs. veteran could make a move.
“I think Josef realized that he can not just compete, but win at this level,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said. “The same guy he had beat from Penn at EIWA’s ended up placing top four, an All-American. He now knows that he has the capability to wrestle with those guys, and he has two more years to figure out what he needs to do to get further.”
Nickal came back to win the match after the surprising start, notching a major decision against Johnson on his silver medal run. Following this, Johnson dropped a hard fought contest against Binghamton’s Jack McKeever, 4-2, ending his first NCAA appearance.
“I didn’t accomplish my goals,” Johnson said. “But at the same time, it was very apparent throughout the entire weekend that I’m on the same level as the guys who did place. So I have a really positive outlook on the whole experience, and I walked away with confidence knowing that not only myself, but a lot of guys on our team moving forward can compete at that high level.”
Captain Todd Preston ended his celebrated Harvard career with his third NCAA tournament appearance. The 2014 EIWA champion had a hard time building back momentum after a first round loss. At 141 lb., No. 10 ranked Preston dropped the bout to Clarkson’s Brock Zackerl. After notching a 13-3 decision in the consolation brackets, Preston dropped a 5-3 decision to Chatman’s Mike Pongracz.
“He wasn’t at his best this weekend, and it may sting for a little, but Todd has been a wrestler that has been a leader on this team from the beginning,” Weiss said. “He inspired his teammates, and he grew tremendously throughout his time here. He poured himself into the process and has done a great job for us.”
Gobbo was the only Crimson representative in the second day of competition. At 165 lbs., Gobbo notched a fall against Columbia’s Tyrel White, before falling himself to Alex Dieringer, the undefeated, three-time NCAA champion out of Oklahoma State. In the second day of competition, the EIWA champion fought his way through two rounds of wrestlebacks, before getting edged by Purdue’s Chad Welch in the final bout of his college career, 8-4.
“That final match, he had the first takedown,” Weiss said. “They were swapping points the whole match, and he made a great comeback, but he just ran out of time. He was right in that match, and he left it all out there on the mat. That’s all we can ask for, and I’m really proud of how he did.”
For Preston and Gobbo, the weekend was a bittersweet career ending for two integral wrestlers on the Harvard team.
“It has been a true honor to coach both Devon and Todd,” Weiss said. “They have brought tremendous successes to the program, and have grown into fantastic men, which was evident through the poise they handled themselves with this weekend. I know they have great things ahead of them, and could not be more proud as a coach.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard baseball team (5-7) finished up its Spring Break trip in Florida with a three-game set against Army on Thursday and Friday, losing the opening game on Thursday before splitting Friday’s doubleheader with the Black Knights (8-10).
The Crimson recorded double-digit hit totals in each of the three games at Jack Russell Stadium in Clearwater, with Saturday’s finale rained out after the top of the third inning, with Harvard leading, 3-0.
“This whole break in general has been pretty positive,” captain DJ Link said, “and I think we’re pretty confident going into Ivies that we have a good team, a good lineup, a good staff, and guys in the bullpen who can come in and do their jobs. As a whole, we’re in a good situation.”
Sophomore third baseman John Fallon continued his strong start to the season with four hits and five RBIs. Senior second baseman Mitch Klug had six hits in nine at-bats in the series, improving his batting average from .171 to .273.
HARVARD 5, ARMY 3
The Crimson avoided a sweep Friday afternoon with a win over the Black Knights, riding junior right-hander Nick Gruener’s complete game to a 5-3 win. Gruener improved to 2-1 on the season, striking out four while walking none.
“We all knew [Gruener] was going to go out there and pitch well,” captain Matt Sanders said, “but it was a tremendous effort for him to go out there, throw a complete game, and succeed against their hitters who are scrappy at times. Hats off to him for a great effort and pitching incredibly well.”
Fallon’s third-inning single extended his hit streak to five games, while freshman first baseman Pat McColl also extended his own hit streak to five with a double in the first frame.
Army struck first in the second, but freshman center fielder Ben Skinner, hitting ninth, smashed his first career home run over the left field wall in the top of the fourth to give the Crimson a lead it would never relinquish.
The Black Knights saw their cleanup hitter get on base in every at-bat through six innings, but Gruener stayed composed. In the bottom of the fourth, Army started with three singles but the Miami native battled back with a strikeout and two flyouts to end the rally.
Runs in the sixth and eighth innings gave Harvard insurance heading into the ninth, and after a two-out error allowed the Black Knights to cut the lead to 5-3, Gruener forced a pop up to finish things off.
ARMY 6, HARVARD 4
With ace senior Sean Poppen on the mound in the first game of the doubleheader, bad defense cost the Crimson in a tough 6-4 loss.
Poppen threw six innings while allowing six runs, with only two earned. The death blow came in the top of the sixth, when the Black Knights tagged the Virginia native for four runs, all unearned and all with two outs.
Quinn’s sacrifice fly in the fourth cancelled out Army’s RBI single in the top of the second, but the Black Knights to retake the lead on a wild pitch in the top of the fifth. In the sixth, an errant throw from Poppen on a bunt allowed the batter to reach second. A single and walk loaded the bases before back-to-back two-run singles extended Harvard’s deficit to 6-1.
Freshman left fielder Trent Bryan hit a three-run home run in the bottom of the seventh, the first four-bagger of his career, but it wasn’t enough as the Crimson’s rally came up just short. Nonetheless, the team’s veterans took notice of the performance of the younger hitters.
“I’m really impressed with the younger guys, coming out playing with energy and being fearless out there,” Sanders said. “You look at guys like Bryan, McColl, Skinner, and they’ve settled into a role quickly in the lineup, and I think they’re going to be guys we can really rely on later in the season.”
ARMY 13, HARVARD 12
The first contest of the series was arguably the most exciting, with the two teams combining for 25 runs and 29 hits before the Black Knights grabbed a walkoff win, 13-12. Klug was the main man offensively, going 5-for-5 with two runs and an RBI.
Harvard’s bats were hot from the start, scoring four runs in the first. Army responded with three in the bottom half of the inning, setting the tone for the game.
“When we had runners in scoring position, we were capitalizing on those opportunities,” Link said. “That’s what you have to do in games where you’re going to put up a lot of runs.”
Fallon’s three-run double in the top of the fourth extended Harvard’s lead to 7-4 before the Crimson scored three more in the fifth to grab a 10-5 advantage.
By the end of the seventh, however, Army had clawed their way back, cutting the lead to 10-9. RBI singles from Bryan and junior catcher Josh Ellis in the top of the eighth seemed to provide ample insurance, but five singles in the bottom of the ninth off of senior Sean O’Neill were enough to propel Army to the victory.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard sailing team competed in three separate regattas over the weekend in Connecticut, Maryland, and Massachusetts, posting top-ten results in each of the events.
SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND TEAM RACE
After finishing seventh last weekend in the St. Mary’s Team Race, Harvard’s veteran leadership looked to make its mark in New London, Conn., in an event hosted by Connecticut College.  The group did just that, even if the weather conditions were far from ideal.
“There wasn’t very much wind the first day so we didn’t get many races in, which was unfortunate,” junior crew member Julia Lord said. “We only were able to finish one round robin. Usually what we would like to do is have more than that so we can have more practice.”
When the results from Saturday, the first day of racing, were posted, the Crimson was in the lead with a 3-0 record against the rest of the field.  This fast start did not prove to be a fluke for Harvard, as it was able to finish in second place out of the ten inter-conference schools it competed against.
“I think we did a lot better this weekend than in the past,” Lord said.  “We were on spring break this week so we had a lot of time to practice.  I think that was really good for us. There were a couple of things we could’ve done better, but we’ve definitely improved since last weekend.”
The Crimson’s only losses came to Brown and Connecticut College.  With Harvard and Brown both posting identical 7-2 records over the event, the loss to the Bears proved consequential.  Brown came home with the trophy as the squads’ results against one another broke the tie between the two.
ST. MARY’S WOMEN’S INTERCONFERENCE
In the second regatta hosted by St. Mary’s in the past two weeks, the all female contingent sent down to Maryland by the Crimson finished tenth place in out of a pool of 18 schools.
Racing in FJs and 420s in shifty winds of 7-10 knots, Harvard totaled 328 points over the 36 races competed in by its A-Division and B-Division crews.  Tis performance was more promising for the Crimson than its 13th place result a week prior in the shortened Navy Spring Women’s Regatta.
The A-Division boat of sophomore skipper Taylor Ladd and sophomore crew Kirstin Anderson started off the event solidly with a top-five and top-ten finish in the first two races.  After a lull in its performance over the next three events, the boat pulled itself together and earned top-ten finishes in ten of the final 13 contests.  Over the weekend, the duo scored 148 points; good enough for fifth place in the division.
Freshman skipper Taylor Gavula and freshman crew Lena Episalla led their boat to an 11th place result in the B-Division.  Posting consistent results throughout the weekend, the pair scored 180 points over 18 races.
Just besting Boston College’s 227 point showing, the University of Rhode Island was able to claim victory in the regatta with its 219-point performance.
THE IKE GEIGER TEAM RACE REGATTA
In a team regatta hosted by MIT on the Charles River Basin, Harvard posted a 10-11 record en-route to finishing fifth among the eight in-conference schools competing in the event.
Facing stiff breezes early on in the morning that relaxed as each day progressed, the team of Crimson sailors racing in FJs was able to best the Coast Guard, Northeastern, and URI.  After a promising 6-1 start in the first round robin of the event on Saturday, the shifting conditions began to take a slight toll on Harvard as the racing plodded on, leading to the final result.
“The conditions were pretty variable throughout the weekend, breezes were up and down, and the wind changed directions a lot,” sophomore crew Kevin Coakley said. “I think we did pretty well adapting to a lot of different circumstances, but we definitely have some work to do as far as becoming a cohesive unit and being able to transfer all the skills from one type of breeze to other types of conditions.”
Boston College pulled away with the victory after going undefeated on Sunday’s round robin and posting an impeccable string of results to finish the weekend with 19 race wins to its two losses.

Welcome back to campus, Harvard!
Whether you spent the last week chilling in Cambridge yearning for the sweet taste of HUDS meals, or lounging on a beach in Cancun, or carefully crafting a March Madness bracket that would be in tatters by last Friday night, you probably weren’t thrilled to be returning to classes today.
You didn’t do any of that reading you were supposed to catch up on over break, that pset due tonight at midnight is still lying unfinished in your backpack, and the outside temperatures are hovering around freezing again.  Just when you think life can’t get any more grim, Dean Khurana and Dr. Paul J. Barreira slide in your @college inbox with an update about the hottest topic of the Spring semester: the mumps.  (Ok, technically that update dropped last Thursday, but who actually checks their email over break?).
Didn’t read the email?  It’s ok, it’s basically just Rakesh and Dr. Barreira reminding us all to not be gross.  What’s more concerning is the increased ambiguity about how many people actually have the mumps. The numbers ‘have grown’, according to the update, but by how much it doesn’t say.  Should we take that to mean a handful of students, or like, seven handfuls?  How many students even constitutes a handful? We need answers, Paul.
Speaking of needing answers, spare a thought for the residents of the Inn at Harvard who weren’t initially aware that their dorm was being used to house mumps patients in isolation.  Leaving aside the fact that the way the students figured it out (by noticing food packages suspiciously left outside the doors of isolated students) was kind of hilarious, it was probably pretty distressing news for them to learn.
Considering the incubation period for mumps is up to three weeks, we can be almost certain that mumps won’t be going away any time soon.  About as certain as we were that those “6-10 inches” of snow never had a chance at shutting down class today (sorry Freshmen, you won’t be experiencing the glory of a Harvard snow day any time soon).
