After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Nov. 6, Record Hospital—the underground music department of WHRB, Harvard’s FM radio station—hosted musicians in Holden Chapel to perform for a local audience from all over the Boston area. The lineup included Haram, a New-York based punk band whose frontman, Nadir Habibi, sings entirely in Arabic, and St. Ripper, a female-fronted punk band from the Boston area. Also in attendance was CYBERBULLY, a solo electronic act, as well as Epoxy, an outfit so fresh that they are yet to establish themselves online.
Roughly 40 attendees were present by the time the show started—the vast majority of whom were not students at Harvard but members of the underground community who had traveled from Boston and the surrounding area. Nicole R. Spector, a graduate student at Northeastern University, found out about the event on Facebook. “I’m here to see Haram,” she said, referencing the evening’s headliner, who have been doing well in the punk scene since releasing a demo in 2015.
Brieanna R. Martin ’18, a member of Record Hospital, explained that much of the department’s motivation behind organizing the gig was to connect with the community in the Boston area. “We try to have events and make our air the best it can be to engage the local punk scene. A lot of people might not be from Harvard or Cambridge but from all over Boston, so they can get their music exposed and widen their audiences.”
Emma I. Weil ’18, another organizer of the event, agreed. “Harvard doesn’t engage with the community, and it’s really important for us that we’re actually not only being a radio station that has airplay but that we’re also doing something productive for Harvard and also for Cambridge and Boston.” Martin added that as part of a Harvard organization, Record Hospital was able to use on-campus venues for free, and they would like to share such resources with people who did not have the privilege.
Epoxy was the first act to perform in the chapel. The three-piece band were well received, the crowd settling into a semicircle around the stage with about half of the attendees wearing earplugs to shield their ears from the loud volume. They were followed by CYBERBULLY, an electronic act so loud that the entire building vibrated for a solid 20 minutes. At 10 p.m., Haram opened their set to a full chapel, the crowd having grown to fill the room. To wrap up the show was St. Ripper, fronted by Amanda Ray. As listeners nodded along throughout the night, a tiny statue of Mozart, gifted to the Harvard Glee Club in 1921 and positioned high on a ledge, cast a watchful gaze over proceedings.
Alan R. Jackson, who performs as CYBERBULLY, spoke favorably of the event following his slot. “It was great. The venue was really cool, and especially around Boston I’ve found that a lot of bands sort of stick together, so to be brought into a totally new scene of people is really nice.”
The lights were brought up between every act, and attendees mingled in small groups, chatting as the bands transitioned onstage. The acts themselves collaborated to share bass amps and equipment. For those who missed out on the event, Martin was quick to point out that it would not be their only opportunity to attend a Record Hospital-hosted evening. “We put on a much bigger show which is two nights in the Spring, [called] Fest,” she said, adding that the local community can also engage by tuning into Record Hospital’s weekly programing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the lead-up to today and tomorrow’s vote on graduate student unionization, supporters and detractors have presented many arguments about the benefits and costs of unionization. Anti-union documents (like the University FAQ, or “A Critical Approach”) tend to present the union as a nebulous specter of “intrusion” into our lives, asking us to pay dues, talk to organizers, attend rallies, and possibly go on strike for uncertain improvements. Though union supporters have already disputed the factual claims in these arguments, I’d like to explain my support for a union at a more general level. I do think we should be paid more for our work—and with a union, I think we would be—but it’s about more than that. Having a union is about making our workplace democratic.
Democracy means being organized so that you can have a collective voice. That means participating in organizations like political parties, activist groups, or unions. Organizations need money to function, and we shouldn’t begrudge them our dues for the same reason the University should be happy to pay graduate students—we work for the University, and the union works for us.
Democracy means having lots of conversations. About money, about how much you’re being asked to work, about how people treat you, about the right direction for higher education. Organizers of the union want to talk to you so they can understand your point of view, so your individual voice doesn’t get left out of the collective voice. They’re not just trying to badger you into doing one thing or another.
Democracy means taking action sometimes. That might mean striking. There are many ways of limiting strikes to minimize or eliminate disruptions to people’s research, but at the end of the day, if something needs doing, people need to be in the streets demanding it. People need to be calling their friends to join them. People need to be writing letters and signing petitions and going to meetings. Not everyone can do this all the time—that’s why unions pay staff organizers—but everyone should be able to do it some of the time. And if no one has that time to spare because they have too much work, that’s a problem we really should be up in arms about.
Democracy means caring about other people. It means being willing to lend your energy, or at least your vote, to help someone struggling in another department, just as it means caring about people of other genders or races or religions. This doesn’t mean leveling all graduate students’ pay. But it might mean calling on the University to curb the growth of administration, or to pay its highest officers less. It might also mean lobbying state and federal government to give more money to higher education. It does not have to mean fighting with administrators or our fellows; we can all work collectively to fight for what’s best for the University as a whole.
Democracy means struggling for things you might not get. Every anti-union argument I’ve seen emphasizes the uncertainty of the future. The University’s FAQ notes that “there is no way of knowing now whether or how current stipends and benefits might change.” In truth, the future is always uncertain, and politics even more so. Just look at last week’s vote returns. But not having a union is like not having elections at all (we certainly didn’t elect Drew Faust). It’s true there’s the Graduate Student Council, and some of our representatives are elected. But having been on the GSC executive board for three years, I can tell you that administrators were never more open to change than after they found out students were organizing a union. They know full well we have more power together than individually.
When I read anti-union material, what I hear is that we should be content to keep our heads down and take the money Harvard gives us. Of course I’d like to see a Harvard that guarantees us a living wage year-round the whole time we’re here. But I want more than a dollar amount on an offer letter. I want to see a Harvard where the President and Overseers meet with graduate student representatives regularly. I want to see a Harvard where folks are invested in each others’ well-being and work to protect each other from mistreatment and discrimination. I don’t think we can have any of these things unless we work together to make sure Harvard hears us clearly.
Opponents of a union often say they want to “work with Harvard, not against it.” I think that means a union is exactly what they want.

Today and tomorrow, I and other Harvard students in teaching and research positions will vote on whether we want the Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers to represent us. Are we ready? Does making this decision seem daunting to you as you navigate exams and papers in the middle of the semester? Completely black-and-white after being bombarded with pro-union arguments for the past year? Have you simply not had time to think about the process in depth? If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, I argue that you should vote "no" to the HGSU-UAW—whether you support graduate student unionization or not.
We simply have not had enough time to discuss the pros and cons of having a union at Harvard. Up until Nov. 8, much of the student body (along with the rest of America) was focused on the presidential election, leaving us only a week to learn about the unionization process. The situation for early year graduate students, who are still taking classes, is especially bad. Many classes have exams or large assignments due in early or mid-November. I and many other second year students in the Biological and Biomedical Sciences Ph.D. program had our thesis proposal rough draft due last week, for example. First-year graduate students are also still adjusting to their first semester of graduate school and rotating while dealing with their course loads. These issues are only worsened by the lack of absentee ballots for the union election; students who are not on campus or who cannot travel to one of the polling locations today or tomorrow simply cannot vote. What are students flying home early for Thanksgiving or who do not work near Longwood or Harvard Yard to do?
Union representatives argue that any election date would have its inconveniences—but some dates are much more inconvenient than others. This is one of them. In contrast, holding the election early in the spring semester would have given students time to learn about the unionization process over winter break, while avoiding exams and assignment deadlines before the holidays. The extra time would also have given both pro- and anti-union sides the opportunity to fight for more accessible voting locations and an absentee ballot system. Unfortunately, the union election cannot be postponed at this point; the best way to show union representatives that you have doubts about the election process is to vote "no" today or tomorrow and open the conversation. Even if the issues outlined above do not affect you personally, consider voting "no" to help early year graduate students—who would be most affected by a union—in these situations. A "no" vote does not necessarily mean you outright reject all forms of graduate student unionization at Harvard. However, in all cases, it will provide the time necessary to discuss how an election for such a union could be run in a fairer, unbiased way.
In contrast, if the majority of students vote "yes," reversing the unionization process is almost impossible. Union representatives argue that there is no "downside" to forming a union. In fact, there are many potential disadvantages to forming a union. The aim of this piece is not to argue either for or against forming a union, though points against the union have been outlined by other students elsewhere. In addition, many students have also shared personal testimonials about how they have been negatively impacted by the HGSU-UAW and unions at other universities on the Against HGSU-UAW Facebook page.
Union representatives argue that they would never allow such things to happen at Harvard. But what steps has the HGSU-UAW taken to safeguard against these possibilities? What about the students who already feel pressured by union organizers, pitted against their peers, excluded, or discriminated against? The upcoming union election does not take the wishes of separate departments into account—the majority of students in my program, BBS, could vote "no" and still be voted into the union if the majority of students in other programs vote "yes," for example. Would contract votes, which decide stipends and benefits for all graduate students, or votes to strike, be held in the same way? The answers to these questions are vital towards making an informed decision on how to vote. The fact that union representatives have not taken the time to consider and publicize the answers to these issues should be reason enough for students to vote "no." Putting the brakes on the unionization process would enable both students and the union itself to consider these issues more closely.
Ask yourselves: What is the downside to having more time to discuss unionization? Even union representatives would agree that everyone should be fully informed before this decision is made, given its importance. Even if you support the HGSU-UAW, do you want the union to be formed when many students have not had time to make an informed decision? Casting a "yes" vote means that the union will be formed right now, without taking these concerns into account. By casting a "no" vote, you will help overwhelmed graduate students have their voices be heard—and pave the way towards having a thoughtful, balanced discussion about unionization.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A week after Election Day, the nation and the Harvard community are still coming to terms with the historic election of Donald J. Trump. Unprecedented in his role as president-elect, Trump ran a campaign that indiscriminately espoused hateful rhetoric. We condemn the racism, sexism, misogyny, xenophobia, and bigotry that Trump has embraced. His election to office now legitimizes them in the national mainstream. In the wake of this divisive presidential campaign, moving past his election in a day or even a week is not feasible for many students on this campus. More time is still necessary for them to settle.
There are many students who remain distraught due to the results of Election Day. While it would be wrong for  administrators and faculty to presuppose all students are upset with the president-elect, we encourage them to recognize, with continued consideration and support, the students who are under distress. Similarly, students who supported Trump must seek to understand the shock and indignation still ripe on this campus that is causing many students to shutter themselves from others’ opinions.
A vote for Trump may not mean a person wholly embraces his philosophy, but nevertheless, it means that they were able to overlook the odious rhetoric that directly threatens livelihoods of marginalized groups in order to cast a vote. As much as Trump supporters would like their voices to be heard—and as much as they deserve their voices to be heard, as we have affirmed—they must be mindful of other students’ open wounds and approach them with respect and compassion rather than skepticism.
This sympathy should extend to students’ reactions to protests. While nothing can change the result of the election, the expression of pain and anger through protest should not be dismissed as pointless noise. Protesters, both on and off this campus, believe that a president-elect who espouses racism, sexism, misogyny, xenophobia, and bigotry is an injustice, and are exercising their freedom of speech. We must allow them to use their demonstrations to demand that Trump, his supporters, and the rest of the country be held accountable to their needs and values as well.
We would be remiss to ignore the painful truth that, as students on a traditionally liberal campus, few of us expected or even seriously entertained the idea of a potential Trump presidency. In failing to grapple with that possibility, many of us lost touch with the majority of Americans outside of Harvard’s gates. The so-called Harvard bubble has become disconcertingly insular, and students must confront the biting reality that Harvard’s predominating bias does not reflect the views of the entire nation. It is important to have a dialogue, however stilted and difficult it may be at first, where students are truly considering all perspectives, hearing all voices and not just affirming each other’s liberal ideas and shutting contrary opinions down—because, as evidenced by Election Day, Harvard students are not the only people who have a say in this nation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Nov. 21, 2016, at 1:04 p.m.
To the Editor:
Yesterday, several of Harvard's roughly 40 courageous undocumented students and their supporters stood on the steps of Widener Library and bore witness to their fears—of exposure, of sanction, of deportation. But they also spoke of the sacrifices made by their parents and their own hard work, of the way that their own presence at Harvard represented the culmination of a larger, collective effort. It is time for the students, faculty, staff, and administration of Harvard to join them.
The Harvard University website includes a pointed statement about the University’s commitment to excellence through diversity, emphasizing “the centrality, importance and complexity of inclusive excellence in our academic and administrative endeavors, [and] the benefits of diverse learning and working environments.” The website also emphasizes the ongoing character of the University’s commitment: diversity is not simply a matter of admission. It is a matter of an enduring and democratic commitment to learning from one another. It is central to the university’s pedagogical and intellectual mission.
In ways both explicit and implicit, the president-elect of the United States has threatened that mission. Our students, colleagues, and co-workers—immigrants and Muslims and queer people and people with disabilities as well as women of various backgrounds—have some reason to fear for their safety. In the weeks, months, and years ahead, it will take steadfast commitment and sustained energy to protect the democratic inclusion and spirit of open inquiry from which this University draws its vitality.
The students who bravely stood on the steps of the library yesterday are on the front lines of that struggle. The president-elect has pledged to revoke a well-known executive order deferring deportation in the case of students in good standing. Because the original executive order allowing for those deferrals required students to register with the government, it created a guide which the new administration will be able to follow to the gates of our campus. It is imperative that we stop them there.
Therefore, the undersigned Harvard faculty call upon the President and administration of Harvard to defend the students and mission of our University by taking actions including, but not limited to the following:
1. Reaffirm the University’s commitment to creating a campus atmosphere of respect by denouncing hate speech directed at immigrant, minority, female, and LGBTQ students, employees, and faculty and by informing the campus of existing resources (such as hotlines, counseling, and legal assistance) for reporting and responding to bias or hate incidents, at Harvard and beyond.
2. Respond immediately, concretely, and clearly to the petition calling for increased administrative support for undocumented students at Harvard signed by many members of our community and delivered to Dean Khurana yesterday. We understand that Harvard may not be able to take, or may decide against, some of the steps recommended by that petition, but we believe that the students deserve a quick, clear, confident response. Unless and until Harvard hires the additional staff recommended by that petition, Harvard administrators should make clear (on posters, as well as in email, or by other public means) what offices, and what people, are charged with helping undocumented students who require legal, institutional, practical, or psychological support.
3. Declare Harvard to be a “sanctuary campus,” (in keeping with municipal laws in Cambridge, a sanctuary city), and remind the Harvard University Police as well as all faculty, staff, and administration that it is the University’s commitment to support and protect all of its students, faculty, and employees, regardless of their citizenship status, religion, ethnicity, or national origin.
4. Reaffirm current admission and financial aid policies regarding undocumented students.
5. Guarantee student privacy, in accordance with existing policy, by refusing to release information regarding citizenship status or other personal information.
6. Make clear that Harvard will use all legal and practical means at our disposal to protect all members of our community in the months and years to come.
Sincerely,
Suzanne Preston BlierWalter JohnsonStephen Burt

To the Editor:
For more than a year and a half we have been building our union, HGSU-UAW. We have had thousands of conversations with student workers from across Harvard. With our union, we can stand together to protect what we have and to win improvements to compensation, health and dental care, mental health, child care, protections from discrimination and sexual harassment, workload protections, job security, and a fair grievance procedure. We are voting yes to unionization.
Now more than ever, the future of higher education is at stake. We can expect Congress to attempt to cut federal research funding and the safety nets that protect all workers. Xenophobic acts and the threat of deportations make it all the more critical that we come together to protect each other. By joining with tens of thousands of academic workers across the country and hundreds of thousands of members of the UAW, we can work to protect STEM funding, the Optional Practical Training program, our civil rights, and the academic mission of teaching and research. We cannot meet these challenges individually. Instead, we have come together as HGSU-UAW, to use our collective power to stand up for the integrity of higher education.

On Nov. 7, when I traveled home to the District of Columbia, my parents greeted me with steaming heaps of beef, a crock of buttered broccoli, and a side dish of questions.
My mother wanted to know about recent reports that the Harvard men’s soccer and cross country teams had produced sexually explicit documents rating their female counterparts. My father wanted to know about the all-male final clubs, and how I felt about them as a woman.
“Harvard can feel like an old boys’ club, it’s true,” I told my parents over second helpings. “But I think we’re making progress.”
My mother and I exchanged looks. We beamed. Without saying Hillary Clinton’s name, we both knew why we were smiling. We both knew why I was home.
***
The voting booths, tucked inside the neighborhood recreation center next to fields where I played soccer as an eight-year-old, opened at 7:00 a.m. I arrived at 6:30, feeling out of place in an already-long line of lawyers and government employees, uniformly clad in black wool topcoats.
Stiffly glamorous, these denizens of tony northwest D.C. double-fisted iPhones and Starbucks coffees as their ballot-white breath fogged their phone screens. (I launched “Candy Crush” on my phone, hoping others would think that I, too, had emails to check.)
Spots of color soon began to break up the black monotony. Women in bright-colored jackets and scarves joined the line, many towing sleepy, messy-haired children.
One voter, D.C. resident Christy H. Ross, approached the center holding hands with her tween-aged daughter, still clad in pink-and-green checkered pajamas. Ross was dressed all in white but for the bright blue “Hillary” sticker on her shirt.
“I dragged her out of bed early because I just feel like it’s so memorable,” Ross said, ruffling her daughter’s hair. “Being able to vote for a woman for the first time in our nation’s history—I mean, we’re almost 250 years old.”
Ross grinned. “I think when she’s older she’s going to remember that.”
Further down the line, a couple in matching electric-green windbreakers clutched their bikes and the hands of their young son. The woman reached inside her backpack for a drink, swigging from an “I’m With Her” water bottle.
Nearby, Laura R. Wigglesworth, a woman in her mid-forties, waited with her two high school-aged daughters, Molly and Claire. Wigglesworth watched with a smile as her children chattered and interrupted each other at high speed and top volume. I caught the words “Hillary” and “glass ceiling.”
All three sported “NASTY” writ large in black eyeliner on their foreheads, with a Venus symbol drawn on one cheek. When I asked Wigglesworth whether she’d had to roust her daughters from bed that morning, she chuckled.
“Oh no,” she said. “They brought me along.”
***
Reaching my voting booth, I felt a bit let down. I had been expecting something grand and momentous—something befitting my first-ever vote in a presidential election cast for the first-ever female nominee of a major political party.
Instead, I found myself in a repurposed basketball court. The line of voters snaked around a much-abused foosball table and past a dented red popcorn cart, littered with a few leftover kernels.
On one wall was a poster advertising karate lessons, held weekly at the center. A middle-aged white man in karategi, photoshopped in front of a wall of fire, stared down at me. (He bore a suspicious resemblance to the bumbling, overweight volunteer election official Frank, who guided me through the check-in process.)
No one was solemn or grave or silent. Children giggled and played; parents joked. One of the myriad lawyers removed her black overcoat, revealing a blindingly pink blazer that clashed with her red-and-blue “H” pin.
Just in front of me, a mother hoisted her two-year-old daughter onto her lap as she sat down to vote. The two held the pen together, heads bent over the ballot.
How fitting. In one deep breath, I colored the tiny circle next to “Hillary Clinton” with black and hopeful ink.
***
Less than 48 hours later, back in Cambridge, I watched in disbelief as Donald Trump claimed the presidency.
As I’ve done so many times before, I called my mother and waited for her to explain, to make everything intelligible. I’d thought we—me and Ross and the bikers and Wigglesworth and the pink-suited lawyer—were about to elect the nation’s first female president. Instead, we voted into office a man who boasted that he likes to “grab ‘em by the pussy.”
My mother, rarely at a loss for words, told me she didn’t know what to say.
I don’t know, either.
I do have a promise. One day, be it eight years from now or 16, I will take my own child by the hand. We will walk to a voting booth, and we will fill in the circle next to the name of the first female president.

Four experts in environmental justice analyzed the connections between environmental preservation and workers’ rights at the Kennedy School Monday, honoring one panelist for her work promoting safer conditions in nail salons.
The panel, moderated by Marshall L. Ganz ’92, a senior lecturer at the Kennedy School, was structured as an open discussion on environmental and labor issues, as well as the need for innovative solutions to address them.
“What we’re hearing is an account of work that connects the most vulnerable among workers, immigrant workers... and policy development, and groups connecting the two,” Ganz said.
The event celebrated the granting of the Roy Family Award for Environmental Partnership to the California Healthy Nail Salon Collaborative, whose co-founder and manager, Julia Liou, served as a panelist. The award is given every two years by the Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs to a project that promotes an environmental cause through creative methods.
The California Healthy Nail Salon Collaborative works to “improve the health, safety, and rights of the nail and beauty care workforce,” according to its website.
“The issue is that nail salon workers experience health issues because of the toxic chemicals that are in personal care products,” Liou said. “A lot of the workers were experiencing acute symptoms like asthma, respiratory illnesses, even miscarriages.”
Aside from Liou, the panel featured Matthew Tejada, director of the Office of Environmental Justice at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Natalicia Tracy, executive director of the Boston-based Brazilian Worker Center and Brazilian Policy Center; and Donnell “Trip” Van Noppen, the president of Earthjustice, a non-profit environmental law organization.
Each panelist was given time to discuss their personal efforts organizing to improve environmental conditions for citizens, particularly underrepresented or exploited workers.
Tejada emphasized that environmental degradation exists beyond the typically imagined scope.
“A lot of folks think it’s black and brown people living next to a refinery, or it’s a bunch of toxic sites down in the south or somewhere, or something’s happening on the border,” Tejada said. “But environmental justice issues happen throughout all of our communities, throughout the United States.”
Hope Cahan, a California government employee who has worked with the Healthy Nail Salon Collaborative, also attended the event.
“The Healthy Nail Salon Initiative is a great combination of both environmental issues along with social justice,” Cahan said. “We’d certainly like to have this replicated in as many places as possible, and improved upon. The broader goal is to reach out into the whole cosmetology field.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust decried the “acrimonious words” and “escalating numbers of cruel and frightening incidents” reverberating around the country in the wake of Donald Trump’s victory in the 2016 presidential election.
In an email to Harvard students, faculty, and staff Tuesday afternoon, Faust called for resistance to “hatred, intimidation, and intolerance in every form.” She wrote that violence and division “put the very idea and purpose of universities at risk” and “threaten our profoundest national and human values.”
“Although there is much about which we may differ and disagree,” Faust wrote, “we must affirm the values of inclusion and belonging, and exemplify the respect for individuals and ideas that is the essence of an academic community.”
Since Election Day on Nov. 8, racially charged incidents have occurred in schools and universities nationwide.
While there have been no such incidents on Harvard’s campus, many students have demonstrated in the aftermath of the election. Law School students held a rally dubbed “Harvard Against Hate” last Thursday, and hundreds gathered in Harvard Yard Monday to urge the University to protect its undocumented students.
Reflecting on the election in the email, Faust termed it the most “divisive and contentious” campaign in living memory. Among other divisive proposals, Trump called for mass deportations and the construction of a wall along the border between the United States and Mexico. In the past, Faust has lobbied elected officials in favor of more protections for undocumented university students.
Tuesday’s email marks the second time Faust has recently and publicly discussed the national political state of affairs. In her Convocation address to freshmen at the beginning of the semester, Faust warned against “the vile discourse of ethnic, religious, and racial hatred that has spread with such active virulence” across the nation.
Faust—an acclaimed scholar of American history who has said she views the world with an academic’s eye—narrowed her advice to a personal level. She insisted this historical moment demands action from every individual on Harvard’s campus.
“I have necessarily regarded this moment not just through the eyes of a university president, but also those of a historian—as a scholar keenly aware of how history turns on contingency, of how much what each one of us says and does matters,” she wrote. “We cannot shrink from—or escape—our responsibilities to both the present and the future.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The John F. Kennedy, Jr. Forum was filled Monday night as the Young Turks broadcast a live panel from the Kennedy School about the aftermath of the 2016 election, as part of their nationwide tour.
The Young Turks, an internet-based media organization, partnered with the Fusion television channel to host live broadcasts on college campuses throughout the fall.
People eager to see the broadcast packed the forum, with some even putting out chairs on the third floor so they could watch the event. The panelists, who consisted of the Young Turks hosts Cenk Uygur and John Iadarola, Fusion host Felix Salmon, and Institute of Politics fellow Sarah Isgur Flores came onstage to huge applause and a crowd of fans wearing the Young Turks gear. Flores was the deputy campaign manager for Carly Fiorina’s 2016 presidential run.
“This is the biggest, best crowd we’ve seen so far,” Uygur said.
The panelists talked about President-elect Donald Trump’s unexpected victory and his potential policies once he takes office, ranging from foreign affairs to sustainable energy.
“With John Bolton now being a frontrunner for Secretary of State, we have a good idea of his foreign policy,” Iadarola said, referring to the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations whom the hosts said had a pro-interventionist stance.
The panelists speculated on how Trump would respond to pressing diplomatic issues as a businessman. The panelists disagreed on whether the chance for a conflict with Russia will increase. Iadarola and Flores said they thought the chances would increase, while Uygur and Salmon disagreed.
“Putin and Hillary Clinton cannot stand each other,” Flores said. “I think Trump comes in with a different relationship and Putin is relieved.”
As to how Trump got elected, the panelists all agreed that the boost he received from the media was unprecedented due to the substantial news coverage he received from the onset of his campaign.
”If you’re running for a senator in Montana, you don’t get free media,” Uygur said.
Another IOP fellow and New York State Assemblyman Michael A. Blake took the stage for a short one-on-one interview with Uygur. When asked how the Democrats could reach out to Trump voters, Blake said they needed to reconnect with citizens.“If you look at what’s going on in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, a lot of people are like ‘You’re not hearing me, you’re not feeling my pain!’ Those people walk away from the process,” Blake said.
“I could feel the excitement in the room, even from the third level,” Nadine Khoury ’20 said. “It was informative that the panel... offered varying analyses of the early cabinet picks.”

Mental health issues have played a central role in campaign platforms for the Undergraduate Council’s presidency and vice presidency this year. While all four tickets have advocated increasing awareness and support for campus-wide mental health, the tickets differ in their position on the Council’s role in these efforts.
CAMHS IN THE HOUSES
Two tickets want to work toward integrating Counseling and Mental Health Services clinicians from Harvard University Health Services into House life. Scott Ely ’18 and Evan M. Bonsall ’19 have proposed adding a CAMHS counselor to the "house circle" to increase accessibility. Similarly, Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18 and and Alex Popovski ’19 want to give CAMHS clinicians non-resident tutor privileges in Houses, equipping them with dining hall access so that students can informally get to know their mental health professionals.
“It’s much less scary to talk to someone you know,” Popovski said.
Although the Ely-Bonsall and Gonzalez-Popovski tickets have advocated for bringing CAMHS staff in closer connection with students in the Houses, Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 and Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 said the UC’s policies moving forward should be ones that can be “practically implemented.” Sachee and Khansarinia noted that, in the past, candidates’ platforms have pushed for similar House access for CAMHS staff, which they say is difficult to carry out.
“That, in our opinion, is a thing that [has] unfortunately already been explored by the UC and already been seen to be way too expensive to implement,” Sachee said.
Instead, the two said they want to work on “things we actually have control over.” Their published platform includes increasing funding for peer counseling groups and working with College administrators on a policy that allows students to receive assignment extensions solely through consulting their House or Yard resident deans.
Ely, Bonsall, Gonzalez, and Popovski have also advocated increasing funding for peer counselors.
Gonzalez and Popovski said they hope greater socioeconomic diversity among student peer counselors will make student-led mental health resources more attractive to undergraduates. For them, the UC should be supporting these groups with additional financial resources—their platform even includes making peer counseling count for some students’ work-study requirement.
“If you have a termtime job, you’re cut out from being a peer counselor,” Gonzalez said. “We want to make sure there are no barriers to becoming a student peer counselor.”
INCREASING ACCESSIBILITY AND AWARENESS
Gonzalez and Popovski, along with their contenders, are also focused on publicizing mental health resources and making them more accessible to students. Ely and Bonsall have specifically proposed using the UC as a platform to spread information about mental health resources.
For Ely and Bonsall, increasing access to mental health resources fits into their larger mission of accomplishing small, tangible goals, that, in Ely’s words, “make things just a little bit better everyday for Harvard,” and, according to them, is one of the most important focuses of their platform.
“Every year, most tickets have a mental health program, but once they actually get elected, it seems like something else takes precedence—usually trying to throw parties or improve social life,” Bonsall said. “To say that very important issues like mental health and sexual assault should take a back seat to throwing parties—I think that’s completely out of line with the mission of the UC.”
The only ticket comprised of students not on the UC, Grant S. Solomon ’18 and Alexander T. Moore ’18, has been critical of the other candidates and what they characterize as a lack of demonstrated results on the Council thus far.
“They’ve been on the Undergraduate Council and had this large voice. I’d love to know what they’ve done, because I don’t know,” Solomon said.
While not voicing any specific initiatives to address mental health, Solomon and Moore said they want to bring the perspectives of other student groups to the Council.
Solomon and Moore questioned the progress that the current UC has made to improve campus mental health, and this year’s mental health platforms have struck a different chord compared to last year’s presidential campaign.
During the 2015 UC presidential election, Shaiba Rather ’17 and Danny V. Banks ’17 focused their mental health platform on increasing racial diversity among CAMHS therapists. While Sachee and Khansarinia said that they thought increased diversity among HUHS staff was a positive idea, they noted the UC’s limited influence on HUHS hiring policies.
“We hope we can get there in the future, but it’s not something that the UC really has any purview over,” Sachee said.
Voting for the UC’s incoming president and vice president opened on Nov. 14 and will close on Nov. 17.

Students for and against unionization have escalated their organizing activity in preparation for the official vote on Wednesday and Thursday.
This week’s vote will decide whether or not the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers becomes the union representing thousands of teaching and research assistants across Harvard.
HGSU-UAW organizers have increased their efforts in the past month by calling eligible students directly, sending emails, knocking on dorm room doors, and gauging student opinion in dining halls.
“We’ve been having thousands of conversations over the past week with grad workers all over Harvard,” HGSU-UAW organizer and Ph.D. student Abigail Weil said. “I think more than ever our supporters have been stepping up and showing their enthusiasm and dedication.”
The HGSU-UAW also has paid for sponsored advertisements on Facebook and Instagram, which pop up on students' social media feeds.
“We’re really trying to find as many means as possible for getting in touch with people, and so social media is a part of that,” HGSU-UAW organizer and Ph.D. student Aaron T. Bekemeyer said.
Some graduate students in the loosely organized “Against HGSU-UAW” group say they think it is unfair that the union effort has the backing of the United Auto Workers and has been actively organizing for much longer.
Some union organizers are paid $500 a week for 20 or more hours of work per week, according to the union effort's website.
Graduate student union organizer and Ph.D. student Avery A. Davis wrote in an email that UAW’s support has leveled the playing field with Harvard.
“Having the resources from the UAW to sustain our organizing campaign has been essential,” Davis wrote in the email.
However, Ph.D. student Jae Hyeon Lee, who created the “Against HGSU-UAW” Facebook page, sees the resource disparity as an “unfair advantage.”
“We basically have to do with what we have as individuals,” Lee said. “And all of us are busy so we don’t really have time to implement a large scale initiative like phone banking, that the UAW people have been doing.”
For students who are against the HGSU-UAW, Lee’s Facebook page—created just over two weeks ago—is the central hub of organizing and communication about anti-union activities.
“For me, practically the only means,” Lee said. “There are a lot more activities going on in the past few days, but there’s no central place where people report these activities, or strategize and things like that. There’s just a general sense that there’s more conversation and more activities among graduate students.”
Lee created a Google spreadsheet for students to record where posters have been placed. The locations include the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, graduate student dorms, Medical School buildings, Law School cafeteria, and the Science Center.
“I’m getting a constant stream of materials that people produce, forward to me, and then I just make them available on the Facebook page,” Lee said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 16, 2016, at 1:07 p.m.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith and Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Xiao-Li Meng wrote separate emails about the unionization vote to graduate students on Tuesday, touching on personal experiences and the presidential election.
These emails come just one day ahead of a historic vote that will decide whether students form the first graduate and undergraduate union in Harvard’s history.
“The recent US presidential election should remind all of us of the importance of voting, and of how a democratic system determines outcomes by those who cast their votes, and not popular opinion,” Meng wrote.
Smith’s email, which was sent to GSAS students and forwarded to FAS faculty members, urged eligible voters to consider the impact of a union on the “important relationship between a student and a teacher, a graduate student and a mentor.”
“I worry that the conversation has lost sight of the primacy in the faculty’s mind of each student being a student, even when classified as a research or teaching assistant,” Smith wrote. “While we as faculty might not express this primacy often enough, it absolutely shapes, as I will describe, our interactions with each of you as research and teaching assistants.”
Harvard administrators have corresponded with students about unionization several times over the past few months. In his email, Meng stressed that Harvard is working in uncharted territory. He referenced New York University, the only private university to have a graduate student union, writing that the school’s union “lacks the impressive breadth of the union being proposed at Harvard.”
“As a statistician, I know too well the dangers of relying on a sample size of one, especially when the sample is from an indirect source,” Meng wrote.
Their emails come amidst an 11th-hour push by advocates for and against unionization ahead of this week's vote, as well as last-minute questions from graduate students—compiled by the Graduate Student Council—which ranged in topic from union dues to the potential for a strike. The GSC provided answers from both GSAS administrators and the union effort.
In his email, Smith invoked his relationship with the graduate students who work under his wing at Harvard, calling them his “research partners.”  Smith noted, however, that his relationship with his graduate students is not necessarily the standard among all faculty members.
“I’m not naïve. I know that not all faculty members relate to their graduate students,” Smith wrote. “And as Dean, I have seen that most of our faculty act as I do.”
Abigail Weil, a union organizer, had sharp words for Harvard administrators after receiving the email.
“It’s deeply troubling to see this disregard for empirical evidence and this really energetic attempt on the part of the administration to convince people to vote ‘no’ and protect the status quo,” Weil said.
Still, Weil said union organizers were optimistic about the vote, and also referenced the recent election.
“The importance of this vote through the context of the presidential election is lost on nobody,” Weil said. “And I think that’s really adding to that sense of urgency because now people think that the bargaining table is a place to really share a lot of the things that are important to us.”
John Froberg, a graduate student who plans to vote against unionization, wrote in an email that he does not feel there has been adequate time to “have a robust debate” about unionization.
“I think the volume of these emails so close to the election highlights a critical problem with this unionization drive: the very short time frame of the election,” he wrote.
Smith and Meng were not the only administrators to weigh in on the vote. Harvard Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf sent an email to Kennedy School students encouraging them to cast their ballots.
In an email to The Crimson sent through FAS spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven, Smith wrote that "We are encouraging an open discussion where all perspectives are welcome.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s central Title IX office has launched a new website that provides information about the University’s Title IX policies and procedures, continuing a push to better inform students, faculty, and staff about how Harvard responds to cases of sexual harassment and sexual assault.
The Title IX office has historically struggled to inform students about Harvard’s Title IX procedures. In a University-wide survey in 2015, 71 percent of respondents said they were not at all or only a little bit knowledgeable about what happens when a student reports an incident of sexual assault or misconduct.
The website, called a “Resource Guide,” elucidates various aspects of Harvard’s policy and procedures on sexual harassment and sexual assault. It features sections with answers to questions, including “What is sexual harassment?” and “Who can help me?”, as well as resources tailored to specific populations on Harvard’s campus.
The online guide is the culmination of years of work between the Title IX office and other University offices focused on preventing and responding to sexual assault on campus, and  expands on existing online Title IX resources.
The website is also the latest in a series of efforts the Title IX office has taken to better inform students, faculty, and staff about its work. In April, the office released a new set of Frequently Asked Questions about Harvard’s approach to cases of sexual assault, an expansion on a previous version of the FAQs.
“The comprehensive nature of this resource is where it really stands out,” University Title IX Officer Mia Karvonides said Tuesday. “And it’s not just about what can you get from the Title IX office or the Title IX coordinator at your school or your unit, it’s about what are the comprehensive resources across campus, across the University as well as in the community.”
The launch of the website comes about a year after the 2015 sexual conduct climate survey found that 31 percent of senior undergraduate women experienced some kind of sexual harassment—termed “nonconsensual sexual contact” in the survey—during their time at the College. The website incorporates the results of the survey. Harvard unveiled new Title IX policies and procedures in July 2014, setting a “preponderance of the evidence” standard during investigations and creating the Office of Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution.
“We really sought out as many resources as we can for the LGBTQ community because we saw in the climate survey results that… there was a real call to action around making sure we have more supports and are being responsive to the needs of the LGBTQ community,” Karvonides said.
She said that work on the website began in late 2013. More than 60 people, both University affiliates and other people outside of Harvard, reviewed the site before its launch.  While students are one of the primary audiences for the website, Karvonides said her office also designed the site so that faculty and staff members would also find it useful.
The federal government continues to probe the College’s compliance with Title IX in an investigation that began in the spring of 2014.

After a marathon bargaining session, Harvard and its custodial workers reached a tentative agreement around 1 a.m. Wednesday, narrowly averting what would have been the University’s second campus strike this semester.
The tentative agreement will increase employees’ salaries by 12.5 percent over the duration of the four-year contract. By the end of the contract, the average salary for janitors will increase from $21.89 to $24.61, according to a press release from 32BJ SEIU, the regional union that represents Harvard’s janitors. In addition, the contract “includes language to promote full-time work,” satisfying one of the union’s core bargaining goals. Currently, about 30 percent of the janitors work part-time.
In the press release, Roxana Rivera, the vice president of 32BJ SEIU, wrote that the tentative agreement is a “win for families, communities, employers and the economy as a whole.”
“The service workers are rightfully proud of the work they do and are determined that these jobs remain strong jobs, with good wages and benefits that create an entry into the middle class,” Rivera wrote.
The press release also said that the agreement “secures employer-paid” health care, but did not clarify whether those benefits will differ from their current package. According to Rivera, SEIU’s workers do not currently receive their benefits directly from Harvard but rather from a fund SEIU maintains to which Harvard contributes.
University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga praised the agreement.
“Harvard’s custodial colleagues play an important role in support of the University’s teaching and research mission, and we are pleased to have reached a tentative agreement with SEIU,” deLuzuriaga wrote in an emailed statement. “We believe this is a fair deal for both sides, and we are hopeful for a ratification.”
Members of the union voted overwhelmingly last week in favor of authorizing a strike had the two parties not struck an accord before their contract expired Tuesday. The bargaining session ran an hour past that deadline.
Harvard and the union began bargaining on Oct. 7, amid the University dining services’ unprecedented 22-day strike.

In their first non-conference game of the year, Harvard women’s hockey (1-5-0, 1-4-0 ECAC) fell to UNH (4-10-0, 3-5-0 Hockey East) in a hard-fought overtime battle. The contest marked their fifth straight loss, and third one-goal loss in a row.
The Crimson’s .142 winning percentage is deceiving, given that this is the team’s second overtime loss in the last three games.
Senior goalie Molly Tissenbaum has been under siege as of late, stopping 42 shots against the Wildcats, and 50 recently against Princeton. Her .933 save percentage is among the best in the conference. This was the veteran netminder’s third start of the season; she has been alternating games with senior goalie Brianna Laing.
The Crimson drew first blood at 6:10 in the opening period, as junior forward Lexie Laing fired home a power play goal assisted by senior defender Briana Mastel and junior forward Haley Mullins.
Mastel notched her second helper with 9:45 to go in the third period when freshman forward Kat Hughes scored Harvard’s second power play goal of the game—senior Abbey Frazer also assisted on the play. Hughes’ wrister was the first goal of her career.
Down 2-1, UNH fought back late in the final frame, as Amy Schlagel scored the equalizer with just 3:41 left in regulation. Harvard managed a few chances in the final minutes of regulation, but extra time would be needed to settle the contest.
At 3:19 in the overtime period, Harvard’s Mastel drew a two-minute minor for interference, earning the Wildcats a dangerous 4-on-3 advantage. 14 seconds into the penalty kill, the Crimson surrendered a goal to UNH’s Jonna Curtis, her second of the night, following a scrum in front of the net.

Despite trailing at the half by three points, the Harvard women’s basketball team surged past visiting Maine en route to a 69-62 victory in its home opener on Tuesday. In the second straight year hosting the Black Bears (1-2) in its home debut, the Crimson (1-1) avenged its 2015 loss and earned its first win of the new season with concerted defensive play and an increasingly more patient offense as the game progressed.
A 37-34 lead after 20 minutes had Maine feeling confident entering the intermission; nevertheless, with just over four minutes remaining in the third frame, Harvard reclaimed the lead at 45-43 thanks to sophomore guard Sydney Skinner’s lay-in. From there, three lead changes and two ties very much defined the quarter as a nail-biter. The Crimson eventually blew the contest open late in the final period, achieving the game’s largest lead by either team at nine points with just one minute remaining.
“There was a lot of energy,” sophomore guard Madeline Raster said. “Our in-game adjustments were really good. In the first half, [the Black Bears] were getting back-door [looks]... and then we made some adjustments in the second half, and we were able to stop them in our zone.”
Entering the season, both teams had been ranked third in their conferences’ respective preseason polls. The win moves Harvard to 25-10 in home openers under head coach Kathy Delaney-Smith.
“I think it’s a great win for us,” coach Delaney-Smith noted. “For a young team, I was very happy…. I’m very pleased.”
Although the Crimson eventually ran away with a sound victory Tuesday night in Lavietes Pavilion, it did not always control the game as the final line would indicate. Harvard’s only lead of the first half occurred shortly after tip-off and lasted a mere two minutes. It wasn’t until the Crimson locked down defensively and prioritized communication that it found success against the tenacious Black Bears.
“We never really grabbed the ball with any kind of toughness,” coach Delaney-Smith said, “because we were hurrying to be in our transition game… and you’re going to win or lose a ball game based on your defense and your rebounding, especially with this team.”
Maine converted just 23 percent of its field goals in the latter 20 minutes—sinking just seven shots from the floor—as it struggled to solve the committed Harvard defense. One of the leading causes of the Black Bears’ shooting woes was the Crimson’s paint protection in the second half, which recorded five blocks and 17 defensive rebounds in quarters three and four. Harvard freshman forward Jeannie Boehm played a crucial role in her team’s improved interior defense, sending back three Black Bear shots and pulling down five defensive boards.
Trying to to set a fast-paced tempo early in the game, the Crimson pushed the ball up the court in transition after nearly every defensive rebound. Hustle was evident in the first few minutes. Harvard set the tone with 12 rebounds—four of the offensive sort—after the first quarter. Although this gritty play was not enough to give the Crimson the lead entering the second frame, Harvard managed to tie the game with eight minutes left in the first half thanks to some key three-pointers and second-chance baskets.
As the second half opened, Maine stymied Harvard’s early attempts to seize the game by answering each basket with one of its own, often a clutch and-one or deep ball. With a minute remaining in the third quarter, however, Raster stole the ball off a Maine inbound and converted an easy lay-up to tie the game. Seconds later, continuing her impressive individual effort, she drained a three to give her Crimson the lead exiting the third frame—a lead that Harvard perpetuated until the final buzzer.
“[Coach Delaney-Smith said] we were going to win the game with defense and rebounding,” Raster said. “Our shots were going to fall, but we really needed to talk on defense and make the adjustments we ended up making.”
Harvard senior forward Destiny Nunley led both teams in scoring with 22 points on 8-of-12 shooting, while two other Crimson players notched double figures. Raster, coming off a sharpshooting performance last Saturday in which she scored all 18 of her points from long range, played the role of facilitator on Tuesday, dishing out five assists.
For Maine, senior guard Sigi Koizar had the hot hand, chipping in a team-high 21 points while shooting a perfect 9-9 from the charity stripe. The Black Bears finished the night shooting a collective 93 percent from the free throw line, despite second-half woes from the field. Freshman guard Naira Caceres snagged eight rebounds, good for a game-high. Ultimately, it was Maine’s ball movement and aggressive rebounding that kept them in the game.
“In the beginning we saw a lot of those back-screens,” Nunley recognized.
Regarding the opposition’s play, Raster added, “I thought [the Black Bears] were really aggressive on the offensive boards.”
Whereas Maine’s top five scorers all started the game, the Crimson received vastly more substantial contributions from its bench; Skinner, leading all reserve players with 10 points, doubled the Maine bench’s scoring output. Junior guard Taylor Rooks also added six points and four rebounds off the bench.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

On Friday night, Harvard football’s hopes of an outright Ivy League title died in Philadelphia.
A win over Penn would have secured a fourth straight Ivy League title—a school record—along with the satisfaction of beating a Quakers team that had dealt the Crimson its lone defeat in 2015.
But that satisfaction never materialized. Penn jumped to a 14-3 advantage, weathered a Harvard comeback to tie the game, and mounted a methodical touchdown drive to retake the lead. Thanks to a botched hook-and-ladder play, the Quakers tacked on another score as time expired and emerged with a 27-14 win.
That result dropped the Crimson into a three-way tie for first with Penn and Princeton. Next weekend will determine the Ancient Eight crown.
PENNED IN
Before Friday night, the Quakers defensive line had recorded nine sacks, the least in the Ivy League. Led by senior and NFL prospect Max Rich, the Harvard offensive line seemed poised to take advantage of the matchup.
Not so fast. The Quakers brought pressure all night and totaled six sacks. Senior quarterback Joe Viviano never looked comfortable in the pocket and finished with a career-high three interceptions.
Penn defensive end Louis Vecchio accounted for three sacks. The most crucial came with nine minutes left in the fourth, when Harvard faced a third-and-seven from the Quakers 42. Vecchio burst through the line and hugged Viviano to the ground. Down 14-6, the Crimson had to punt.
“If you saw our first couple games, we played against running quarterbacks and used a passive, just-contain-them approach,” Vecchio said. “This week we knew that we couldn’t be afraid.”
Vecchio’s impact went beyond the sacks, however. In the second quarter, he anticipated a Harvard screen, intercepted the throw, and rumbled 40 yards for Penn’s first score. Then in the third quarter, he strip-sacked Viviano at the Harvard 38. The Crimson retained possession but kicked the ball two plays later.
Besides his three picks, Viviano ended the night with 11 rushing yards on 16 attempts, the second straight week that he has averaged less than a yard per try.
FOOLED THREE TIMES
“At the end of the day, we just made too many mistakes to beat a good football team.”
So said Harvard coach Tim Murphy. In fact, he said it four times in the course of a six-minute press conference.
“Mistakes” could refer to any number of events—the three picks that Viviano threw, the game-sealing fumble, or the coverage breakdown that led to the Quakers’ second touchdown.
But few errors loomed larger than the Crimson’s red-zone inefficiency. Harvard marched inside the Penn 20 three times and came away with a total of six points.
The first red-zone trip came on the team’s second drive, when Harvard advanced to the four. However, the drive ended with a field goal after Viviano overthrew senior halfback Anthony Firkser on third down.
At the start of the second quarter, the Crimson had a chance to expand on the 3-0 lead when it pushed forward for a first-and-goal from the seven. Then the gaffes began. A holding call. A near-interception. A sack. Ultimately Penn took over when Viviano tossed a third-down pick.
The final red-zone visit occurred at the start of the fourth. In this case, the Crimson earned a first-and-10 at the Quakers 11 but got no further. Freshman kicker Jake McIntyre converted his second short field goal.
“We’re not really hurt when a team moves a ball,” Vecchio said. “We know that in the end, they still have to get into the end zone. We’re not going to let them do it.”
NO RUNNING ALLOWED
On a night of overall misery, Harvard dominated one aspect of play: the ground game. While Crimson rushers rumbled for 136 yards, Penn totaled 21. On 20 rushes.
Quakers running back Tre Solomon entered the night leading all Ancient Eight rushers in yards per game, but against Harvard he finished with 26 yards on 2.2 yards per carry. Senior Alek Torgersen fared even worse. Previously averaging over 40 rushing yards per contest, he ran six times for negative 18 yards.
Early in the night, Penn seemed eager to establish the ground game, rushing on four of  its first six plays. However, the Quakers soon abandoned this strategy. In the second quarter, the hosts called nine straight pass plays.
Harvard’s run defense proved instrumental in the second half, when the Crimson faced a 14-3 deficit. Penn tried to milk time by calling run plays, but Harvard refused to give up first downs. Between 6:41 in the third quarter and 11:24 in the fourth, the Crimson defense forced three consecutive three-and-outs, giving the offense a chance to cut into the lead.
“Our defense… played heroically,” Murphy said. “We’re capable of hanging in there defensively with anyone.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Call it a logjam. Call it a loaded backcourt. Call it a quarterback competition. Call it what you want, but Harvard has three starter-caliber point guards on its roster.
Co-captain Siyani Chambers is a four-year starter and three-time All-Ivy selection, sophomore Tommy McCarthy started in Chambers’ place last season and averaged nearly nine points and four assists per game, while freshman Bryce Aiken is the most highly touted guard to ever put on a jersey for the Crimson and has the highest ceiling of the trio. Unfortunately, all three play the same position. Does that mean that they can’t be on the floor together this season? For a potential answer to this question, let’s take a 300-mile trip to the Philadelphia Main Line.
You could say Villanova coach Jay Wright is the antithesis of Harvard head man Tommy Amaker. While Amaker opts for an open collar on the sideline and sweats at practice, a three-piece suit is as much a Wright trademark as the discipline of his teams.
Wright graces the cover of GQ while Amaker is reluctant to reveal which quarter of his team will be starting that night. Wright gets in his players’ faces and has no shortage of words for referees while Amaker has not picked up a technical foul since 2007.
However, both coaches have made it a priority to recruit and develop players who fit their systems and have been successful in reinvigorating previously dormant programs.
Taking chances on undervalued talent has recently paid dividends for Wright, who is beginning his 16th season on the Main Line, and his Wildcats. Wright has often steered clear of the basketball hotbeds that are the Philadelphia Catholic and Public Leagues in favor of creating a group composed of players from across the East Coast who fit his team-first system.
Villanova has brought in the four or five-star recruit every now and again but it is by no means outrecruiting Kansas or North Carolina, two teams it defeated last season. Instead, Wright is instilling the “Villanova Way” in his players. Wright’s teams are known for their talented guards, suffocating full-court defense, and ability to shoot the lights out. Few players leave early for the NBA and young players are eased into the college game. The Wildcats rarely beat themselves, largely due to the team’s continuity and personnel. Each player knows his role on the team.
The recruiting and incorporation strategies have worked. In case you forgot, Villanova won the national championship last season in what was perhaps the most exciting title game in NCAA history. Last year’s starting five for the Wildcats featured two seniors, two juniors, and just one freshman, something that has become almost unheard of in today’s power basketball conferences. Perhaps more impressively, neither of the juniors left for the draft and Villanova entered this season ranked fourth in the preseason coaches’ poll.
The last team to repeat as national champions was Florida in 2007. Villanova seems as likely as any team to return to the Final Four this season. The team is not starting a single freshman and players who got their feet wet last season will be eased into bigger roles for Wright this year.
You’re probably asking, what does this mean for the Crimson and its point guard dilemma? Bryce Aiken, meet Jalen Brunson. Siyani Chambers, you be Harvard’s Ryan Arcidiacano.
Villanova entered last season ranked 11th in the country, with several important players returning. The keys to the Corvette belonged to Arcidiacano, a three-year starter and captain since his freshman season. Brunson was the heir apparent but exclusively played point guard in high school. Where would he fit in? An old adage in baseball says that if you can hit, you’ll be in the lineup. Wright found out very early on that Jalen Brunson can hit and started him alongside Arcidiacano from the get-go.
Brunson remained a starter all season and went on to average 9.6 points per game, including a 25-point performance against Temple, his father’s alma mater. The similarities between the Harvard and Villanova situations abound. Chambers is the heart and soul of this year’s Crimson while Aiken is the crown jewel of a loaded recruit class.
“Siyani’s definitely a leader as everyone knows,” Aiken said. “Playing with him, he makes it a lot easier because he’s experienced, he’s been here for three years. He makes the job easier for everyone, he’s always communicating, the loudest person on the floor and I’m learning from him everyday. I’m thankful that he’s on my side.”
The parallels between Aiken and Brunson are striking. Each player grew up in New Jersey—Aiken in Randolph and Brunson 100 miles south in Cherry Hill. Each comes from an athletic family.
Aiken’s parents were varsity athletes at UConn and his two older brothers played college basketball. Brunson is the son of former Temple great Rick Brunson, now an assistant coach with the Minnesota Timberwolves.
Their styles of play are extremely similar as well. Both players are seen as slightly undersized (more than slightly in Aiken’s case) pure point guards who thrive at getting their teammates involved. Future150 praises both players’ three-point shooting and ball-handling. Brunson was rated a consensus five-star prospect coming out of high school, the highest-rated recruit Villanova had received since Mouphtaou Yarou. Aiken is certainly not your typical Harvard recruit nor even your typical Amaker recruit. He has the most scoring potential of any Harvard point guard since Jeremy Lin ’10.
While Harvard recruits under Amaker have come from basketball hotbeds like Los Angeles, Atlanta, and North Carolina, the North Jersey portion of the NJSIAA is an entirely different animal.
Much like how Brunson was tested against the likes of Jabari Parker and Jahlil Okafor in high school, Aiken is no stranger to big name hoopsters. He considers Kyrie Irving a mentor, and Mike Rice, formerly the head man at Rutgers was his high school coach. He played against New Jersey high school stars Isaiah Briscoe (Kentucky), Markis McDuffie (Wichita State), and Malachi Richardson (Syracuse, Sacramento Kings) and nine of his AAU teammates are playing at Division I schools.
While being a pure point guard today means an emphasis on involving one’s teammates, that does not mean that Aiken and Brunson are scared to score. Aiken went for 21 points in his collegiate debut while Brunson had double-digit scoring outputs in 15 games last season. It also doesn’t mean that they can’t play off the ball. Aiken playing with Chambers or Brunson playing with Arcidiacano isn’t John Wall playing with Bradley Beal or Jahlil Okafor trying to coexist with Nerlens Noel.
“We’re both interchangeable,” Aiken said of his on-court dynamic with Chambers. “If he gets the ball, I’ll gladly run the wing and vice versa. We’re very effective when we play together because we’re both ball handlers and we can both create for ourselves and our teammates. Throughout the season, that will be a really effective duo to have on the court.”
It might not be conventional but convention doesn’t always lead to success. Just ask Wright—Wright, who is fond of playing four guards at a time, Wright, who likes using small forwards as centers, Wright, who is not afraid to go 10 or 11 deep so that he has fresh legs to press after his team scores.
While Amaker is somewhat conventional in his inside-out style of play, he can be creative when he needs to be. He went into zone defense more last season to capitalize on his team’s length, brought in a 6’7” natural scorer to be a wing in the Ivy League (Seth Towns), and sat the best player on last year’s team (Zena Edosomwan) to keep up with teams who utilized smaller lineups.
Being a pure point guard these days doesn’t mean putting up Kendall Marshall-esque assist numbers. It also doesn’t mean always bringing up the ball. With wing being Harvard’s biggest question mark and thinnest position, Aiken can fill a hole for Amaker much like Brunson did for Wright a season ago.
Additionally, Aiken will most likely be the team’s starting point guard next November with McCarthy as his backup. Playing Aiken off the ball with Chambers running the point will also allow McCarthy to log meaningful minutes, much like how Phil Booth did on Villanova’s championship team. Harvard needs at least three wings around Chambers this year in order to be successful, so why not have one of them be Aiken? He can get to the rim and makes his teammates better. A lineup with Chambers and Aiken may be undersized but both can get to the rim and create spacing, whether or not they have the ball in their hands.
“The chemistry we’ve still got to get to,” Chambers said. “It’s a lot of new faces for me. For the freshmen, it’s new to play with them and for them to play with us. We just have to really get the chemistry down, but we’ve been working hard at it in practice. If we stick to our identity and be unselfish and continue to move the ball, I think we’ll be alright.”
Does this mean that Aiken will have started and played 22 minutes in a game in which Corey Johnson hits a buzzer-beating three to send Harvard to a national championship this April in Phoenix? Probably not.
Does this mean that Aiken will get Amaker out of the first weekend of the NCAA Tournament just like how Brunson was able to get the monkey off of Wright’s back? It seems like a stretch.
But does this mean that the Crimson will win an extra Ivy League game or two by having its two most talented ball handlers on the floor at the same time for a majority of the game? In that case, I would say that it might be worth bucking convention.

There’s nothing quite as American and college-quintessential as the “tailgate.” Seas of students clad in their school’s colors. The faint scent of beer in the air. The sporadic breakout of spirit cheers, led by either an all-too-eager or an all-too-inebriated fan.
Tailgates are arguably the most exciting part of Harvard-Yale (sorry football fans, you’re outnumbered.) You’re bound to walk away from a tailgate with at least ten prime candidates for your new Instagram or profile pic, and a dozen viable snapchats of you and your friend clad in Harvard merchandise. And did we mention the free food and drinks? If, for some reason, you’re stumbling into the big game with an empty stomach or a stone-cold-sober disposition, heading over to a tailgate is a major key.
We recommend you check out Flyby’s guide to Harvard-Yale, “Pregame Edition” to get a grasp on how best to prep for the tailgate. But while pregames are great for socializing and having fun with a small group of friends, tailgating with a crowd is what gets you fired up for the game itself.
At Harvard-Yale, you’re going to want to find the tailgate that’s best suited to you. That means you might want to veer away from the one that super-secret-single-gender-social-organization is hosting and head over to one where there’s at least a 70 percent chance you’ll bump into someone you know and love. Freshmen, the First Year Social Committee has you covered with a tailgate specifically for your class, and the house committees are banding together with the Office of Student Life this year to bring you a massive undergraduate tailgate right before the Big Game. Think Yardfest block parties, but with much more Crimson-themed memorabilia.
Keep an eye on our daily newsletter, Harvard Today, for the lowdown on any other, smaller tailgates that organizations are hosting on Saturday.
