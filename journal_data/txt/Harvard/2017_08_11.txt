After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BANGALORE, India—A certain summer war film raises my hackles. And as the people around me know well, that means constructing a rock-solid argument to present to anyone who asks why I didn’t like it. I must practice constant vigilance. One never knows when a Nolan megafan will emerge from the woodwork.
Whether it’s with music, movies, or books, I’ve always tried to pin down what I feel about the media I consume. When I love things, I love them fiercely, but there’s only so many ways to say that a novel is amazing. It’s far easier to write reviews for books I didn’t like. That can sound vitriolic, but that’s not the intent.
My criticism comes from a place of frustration: I so badly want to be swept away by this year’s summer anthem that it riles me up when I’m not. I want to break it down and spell out the flaws that I perceive in it. But that can be exhausting. So somewhere around my third phone call to my best friend complaining about “Dunkirk,” I wondered how I could be more appreciative of the things that I do enjoy.
I don’t want to switch off my inner critic. I think it’s important to be critical of pop culture, because it’s never just a TV show. But I do want to celebrate the songs or books or movies that really captured my attention, because there’s a lot of them. And instead of more circular, excited conversations with my best friend about how Matthew Reilly is really how action should be written, I found this enjoyment in another form of media.
At the risk of sounding like my NPR-obsessed parents, podcasts are unexpectedly great. This past week, I discovered “Switched on Pop,” a show dissecting what makes pop music so darn catchy according to music theory. There’s some wildly deep insights that remind me of being in a literature class, and there’s some classical references every now and then that go over my head.
But despite the critiquing it does, “Switched on Pop” is at its core two music lovers breaking down what makes pop so good. Imagine that: A review show that is just crammed full of enjoyment of some of the most popular—and therefore most criticized—Top 40 tracks. And for every time my mind is blown while binge-listening to “Switched on Pop,” there’s five times when I’m just sitting in my seat, eyes closed, swaying to the beat. That’s a feeling you can’t replicate.
It’s that in-the-moment, all-encompassing appreciation that I want to write odes to. I’m still grappling with how to reconcile that aspiration with the part of me that wants to write an entire novel on how much I dislike “Game of Thrones.” But while I’m figuring it out, I’ll be thinking about Ariana Grande’s musical genius.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Like most American universities, Harvard can’t stop thinking about political correctness. We rebrand insensitive slang, reconsider house names, change faculty titles, and replace school seals to keep in tune with PC culture. But the term “politically correct” is slippery, and according to Harvard students, it ranges from “impositions that supposedly protect marginalized groups” to “terminology that define[s] people by their status as a person and not their disability.” Needless to say, the conversation is ongoing.
But at its core, political correctness is an attempt to impose desirable mental attitudes by removing undesirable words from our vocabulary. The words we use, after all, frame our understanding of what we think, write, and say. Changing our vocabulary is thus a matter of changing our intellectual, ethical, and philosophical perspectives. To encourage gender equality, “actress” becomes “actor.” To inspire religious tolerance, “Merry Christmas” becomes “Happy Holidays.” To motivate empathy, “mental retardation” becomes “intellectual disability.” Such vocabulary inculcates unconscious virtue (if there is such a thing) as enlightened society would define it. Although they’re imposed by the ivory towers of business, media, politics, and academia, such attitudes can hardly be considered dangerous. Society, after all, could only benefit if everyone were respectful enough to substitute insensitive words for politically correct, if top-down engineered, ones.
Eric Arthur Blair might disagree with that assessment.
Blair, more commonly known by the pen name George Orwell, joined the PC conversation in 1949, when he published his dystopian classic, “1984.” In the chilling world of totalitarian super-states, where two plus two equals five because Big Brother says so, Orwell’s most eerie invention is Newspeak. This reductionist language is designed to diminish vocabulary and amputate nuance until party members are unable to express independent, heretical thinking that would threaten Big Brother’s power. “Equal” means only “the same” in a literal sense; “all men are created equal” can only be sensibly rendered as “crimethink.” In the parlance of Big Brother, the words to describe freedom and equality’s intellectual or existential dimensions simply do not exist. Words are changed so that mental attitudes—and soon, intellectual, ethical, and philosophical aptitudes—change accordingly.
Sound familiar?
We all generally recognize that the aim of calling the poor “economically disadvantaged” or the lame “physically challenged” is to express respect for, or at least sensitivity towards, those less fortunate than we. Everyone knows PC words are attitude micro-adjusters. Less obvious than the effect of what we say, however, is the effect of what we don’t. As harsh delineations become offensive and prevarication respectful, PC words—like Orwell’s Newspeak—are often used not so much to express meaning as to destroy it.
Newspeak crams nuance into “blanket words” to choke the dangerous precision of ideas. As a result, all words associated with liberty and equality become “crimethink” and all words associated with objectivity and rationalism become “oldthink.” Today, for one example, many words associated with deficiency or disadvantage have become “challenged.” From the physical defects of the “vertically challenged,” “visually challenged,” “aurally challenged,” or simply “challenged,” to the moral felonies of the “ethically challenged,” PC language collects the short, blind, deaf, handicapped, and criminal in the same conceptual cohort. Such misleading euphemisms are becoming the new golden standard of “respect” and “empathy.”
As a result, PC language begins to erase the lines between condition and volition. A person born blind is “challenged” in the same sense as the person who willfully chooses to violate the law. Both are victims of circumstance. “Criminal” or “cripple,” or any other way of distinguishing the two, becomes a dirty word. Precision, true but insensitive, soon acquires a disagreeable taste.
The blurry lines continue. “Juvenile delinquents” are “children at risk.” Over-reactive college students are “triggered.” “Bums” are “homeless people.” Welfare recipients are beneficiaries of “government aid.” And, as justification, “politically correct” is simply “sensitive.” Masked by prevaricating language, accountability too often falls through the cracks of consciousness as it slips through the fingers of discourse.
In the wake of this censorship, the attitudes and ideas eschewed by PC vocabulary are becoming increasingly inexpressible. To say “bum” or “cripple” now is to be condemned and discredited as insensitive—a label devastating enough professionally and socially to make such language almost unthinkable. Though the year is 2017 and not 1984, the step from language to idea is still a slippery one, and a concept without the words to describe it, though not unthinkable, is certainly unarguable. And in a society built on debate and discourse, unarguable ideas remain unarguably powerless.
This isn’t to accuse PC culture of an Orwellian conspiracy. This is simply a caution, as urgent to us as it was to Blair in 1949, that the words we use—and more importantly, the words we don’t—affect the thoughts we think, and ultimately the liberties we either keep or concede.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: August 10, 2017 at 6:36 p.m.
The Justice Department’s decision to reopen an investigation into Harvard’s admissions process may result in the federal government joining an existing lawsuit on the issue, according to several legal experts.
The department last week publicly vowed to investigate allegations that Harvard discriminates against Asian Americans in its admissions process. The department’s investigation will focus on a single complaint filed in 2015 by 64 Asian-American groups that claims Harvard unfairly denied admission to qualified Asian American applicants, Justice Department spokesperson Sarah Isgur Flores said on August 2.
But three legal and affirmative action experts said they think the new investigation means the Justice Department plans to get involved in a separate lawsuit filed by the anti-affirmative action group Project on Fair Representation in 2014. Like the complaint, the lawsuit alleges that Harvard discriminates specifically against Asian-American applicants in its admissions process. The lawsuit is currently in the discovery process.
The Justice Department has multiple options if it chooses to engage in the lawsuit, according to Matthew M. Cregor, who works for the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice, a group that is helping to defend Harvard in court. The department could file a “statement of interest” in the case, submit an amicus brief, or file to “intervene”—request to join the suit on behalf of either the plaintiff or defendant.
The Justice Department could also sue Harvard itself, although all three legal experts reached by The Crimson said they thought that was unlikely.
Cregor said he thought the department is most likely to file a statement of interest. He said the department often uses these statements to make clear “how they think the court should interpret and apply the law.”
“The statement of interest is something they could file tomorrow without asking anybody’s permission,” Cregor said. “And given that it’s this early in litigation, it probably gets them the most flexibility in what role they decide to play in the case going forward.”
But Mishell B. Kneeland, a former Texas assistant attorney general who helped defend the university in the landmark affirmative action case Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, said she thinks the department will be more aggressive and file to intervene in the case.
She pointed to a Justice Department memo, obtained by the New York Times, which revealed the department is seeking lawyers to staff the Harvard investigation.
“Well, since they’re actually looking for people to staff it—I don’t know that you need to send out a call for people to apply if you’re just going to do a statement of interest,” Kneeland said. “It appears to me that they would be looking to intervene.”
Justice Department spokesperson Lauren Ehrsam did not respond directly to a question asking whether the department plans to get involved with the lawsuit Wednesday. She wrote in an emailed statement that the Department “as a matter of policy” does not comment on ongoing investigations, and that “we will not be commenting further on this.”
Edward Blum, the anti-affirmative action provocateur who serves as the president of the group suing Harvard, said he has had no contact with the Justice Department concerning the case, although he would welcome their involvement.
“We would very much welcome the DOJ to intervene in the lawsuit,” he said. “There is room at the plaintiff’s table for the DOJ.”
Cregor, Kneeland, and Roger Clegg, the president of the conservative think tank Center for Equal Opportunity, said they think the Justice Department will have a heavy impact on the lawsuit, if it chooses to get involved. All three said they believed the Justice Department would intervene in favor of Students for Fair Admissions.
“It would bring the resources of the Justice Department into the lawsuit, and also the weight and the credibility of the Justice Department, too,” Clegg said. “Judges tend to pay attention to what the Justice Department says.”
Kneeland added that the department’s intervention would force Harvard to expend “significant resources” to compete with Justice Department lawyers.
As an immediate first step, the Justice Department will likely begin examining Harvard admissions data, Cregor and Kneeland said. The University was already ordered in September 2016 to submit six years of admissions data as part of the Students for Fair Admissions lawsuit.
Although on opposite sides of the issue, Blum and Cregor both see the Justice Department’s investigation of Harvard’s admissions as having wide-ranging implications—extending far beyond the University alone. Blum said he thinks this investigation will spark a departmental effort to examine admissions at “elite schools across the country.”
Cregor sees the investigation as having a more symbolic impact.
“I think it’s a shot across the bow to universities and states that are working to promote the diversity of their populace in their institutions of higher education and it’s a none-too-silent dog whistle to a fraction of Americans who want to claim reverse discrimination,” he said.

Jared Kushner: Harvard alum, advisor to the president, and...master chef? Many of today’s—and yesterday’s—celebrities once called Harvard home, so Flyby decided to dive deep into the College’s yearbook archives to find out what some noteable alumni were up to during their time in Cambridge.
John Fitzgerald Kennedy ’40
Though he is one of the most popular presidents of all time, John F. Kennedy ’40, a former Crimson editor, didn’t always possess the optimism that many commander-in-chiefs are known for. In the Class of 1940’s post-graduation report a few years after he graduated, Kennedy wrote about his time in the Navy and his early retirement due to an injury.
Kennedy ended his short review on an ominous note, stating, “I am pessimistic about the future of the country.” Despite—or perhaps in spite of—his disillusionment, Kennedy became a congressman only seven years after graduating from Harvard.
Jared Corey Kushner ’03
Prior to helping his father-in-law/president run the United States, former Kirkland House resident Jared C. Kushner ’03 was Cooking Editor of Current Magazine at Harvard. We don’t really know what that title would entail, but our best guess is something having to do with reviewing recipes.
He has had a remarkable career trajectory. From analyzing soufflés to running a New York publication to trying to bring peace to the Middle East, Kushner’s public profile has risen like a well-yeasted loaf of bread.
He concentrated in Government, so one could argue that his acquisition of a highly coveted role at the White House wasn’t without some preparation—or should we say marination. Perhaps there are parallels between Kushner’s cooking skills and his politics: Both require precision as well as dedication—and creativity when it comes to following the rules.
(Curious about Kushner’s other college activities? His yearbook entry also tells us that he was part of the Friends of the Harvard Art Museum, vice president of Friends of Chabad, a Hasty Pudding Club member, and a JV Squash player.)
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Class of 1904
You might be familiar with this Harvard grad because of his 12-year presidency, during which he led the country through a world war and an international economic collapse. Or, you may know the 32nd president because of his time as president of The Crimson and as a Class Day Officer in 1904. Either way, President Roosevelt was a skilled leader—in The Crimson’s newsroom, and in the Oval Office.
Neil deGrasse Tyson ’80
Before Neil deGrasse Tyson ’80 became the voice of seemingly every space documentary (and before he and Bill Nye the Science Guy blessed us all with their bromance), he could be found concentrating in (you guessed it) physics at Harvard College. When he wasn’t busy analyzing black holes, Tyson also participated in crew, wrestling, cross country, and basketball. He was a resident of Currier House.
Conan Christopher O’Brien ’85
Imagine what Conan C. O’Brien ’85, the famous late night host, was like at Harvard in 1985. Your assumptions are probably pretty accurate. He was president of the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to publish a so-called humor magazine. He was also a member of the Signet Society, a social club geared towards those interested in the arts. Perhaps the most surprising thing about O’Brien, who resided in Mather House, is that his field of concentration was “history and literature,” if that counts for anything.
Benjamin Joseph Novak ’01
Benjamin Joseph Novak ’01, better known as B.J. Novak, spent his college years living in Winthrop House and concentrating in literature. Given his later role as Ryan on The Office, it’s not really a surprise that Novak’s yearbook entry lists his involvement in the Hasty Pudding Club and the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club. He was also a member of the Harvard Television Organization, librarian of the Lampoon, and a member of the Phillips Brooks House Association, focusing on prisoner education.
