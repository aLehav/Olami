After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By using Facebook to analyze over 50 billion friendships across 187 countries, a recent study conducted in part by one Harvard professor suggests that people from “high social class” countries tend to have lower percentages of international friends.
Researchers also looked at the Facebook friendships of 857 Americans who self-reported their social class. The researchers found that wealthier Americans have a lower proportion of friends from outside the U.S. than their lower income counterparts.
A team of researchers based at the University of Cambridge’s Department of Psychology that included Harvard Business School associate professor Amy J.C. Cuddy conducted the study.
The study defines social class by objective and subjective measures: both an individual’s income bracket and his or her perceived place in society. At the country level, researchers determined the social class of each country at the national level based on its gross domestic product per capita. The research team used anonymized Facebook data to assess friendships across the entire social network.
“Facebook is a great proxy for the real social environment and a great proxy for friendships,” said lead author Maurice H. Yearwood, a doctoral student at Cambridge.
Researchers found that for those living in low social class countries, on average 35 percent of their friends were international, as compared to 28 percent in high social class countries.
Yearwood said the data suggests that, compared to wealthier people, lower-income people strive to make more global connections. This could be because richer people already have power and resources, so they have less incentive to expand their networks, he added.
“The question now becomes: who’s actually friending who?” he said.
Nishtha Lamba, a co-author and doctoral student at Cambridge, said this study is only the beginning of research about globalization and multiculturalism.
“It’s like a Pandora’s box. Every study is opening a scope for another study,” Lamba said. “This concept of internationalism and social ties should be evaluated a lot more...especially from a cultural standpoint.”
Yearwood pointed to the benefits of assessing massive data sets, now made possible through social media platforms.
“Right now we’re in the technological age,” he said. “Now that we have the data in front of us…we can answer questions we couldn’t answer 10 years ago.”
Big data, one of Yearwood’s areas of focus, involves analyzing a massive set of information to discover correlations or patterns.
“In terms of the social and behavioral sciences, people are still on the fence about using big data,” he said.
Yearwood, however, believes studying big data through online platforms is the cutting edge for global research.
“Being able to partner with different companies like Facebook and Twitter…really strengthens how we use data in the academic community,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 28, 2015 at 2:04 a.m.
SOUTH BEND, Ind.—One week after raising the Whitelaw Cup as champion of the ECAC last March, the Harvard men’s hockey team saw its 2014-2015 campaign come to an abrupt halt at Compton Family Ice Arena, where Nebraska-Omaha sent the Crimson packing by way of a 4-1 victory in the opening round of the NCAA tournament.
Thus, when asked last week about returning to South Bend for this weekend’s Shillelagh Tournament, Harvard co-captain Kyle Criscuolo’s message was plain and simple.
“We have some unfinished business out there.”
In its first trip back to South Bend, the No. 8/8 Crimson (5-1-1, 4-1-1 ECAC) erased a few of its demons, taking advantage of nine Notre Dame penalties Friday night to knock off the No. 18/- Fighting Irish (5-4-4, 3-1-2 Hockey East) by a score of 4-1 to move on to the championship game against RPI on Saturday afternoon.
No two penalties proved more costly than the ones dealt to Notre Dame rookies Andrew Oglevie and Dennis Gilbert with the game tied at one late in the second period.
On the ensuing 5-on-3, Criscuolo received a feed through the crease from junior center Alex Kerfoot, but rather than shoot, the co-captain kicked a pass out to junior defenseman Victor Newell, who ripped a shot from the point that skipped off the boards and right back to Criscuolo.
The co-captain did not let the second chance slip. Criscuolo lifted the puck over the right shoulder of sophomore goaltender Cal Petersen to give the Crimson its first lead with 1:16 to go in the frame. Then with 33 seconds remaining, Criscuolo doubled the lead on the 5-on-4, wristing a shot stick-side past Petersen from a crowded slot.
An injury scare midway through the third period nearly overshadowed the Southampton, N.J., native’s first two-goal effort of the season, as Criscuolo struggled to lift himself up following a blocked shot and eventually required assistance after reaching the bench.
But with Harvard on the penalty kill in the final two minutes of play, Criscuolo was back on the ice.
“I think he was stunned a little bit, and he’ll probably have a pretty good bruise,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “But he came back [and] declared himself ready rock and roll…. We didn’t want to fool around with giving up another goal. He’s one of our best penalty-killers, so we wanted to make sure that if he was healthy we got him on the ice.”
Joining Criscuolo, Kerfoot, captain Jimmy Vesey, and junior forward Tyler Moy on the power play unit was Newell, who took over for rookie forward Ryan Donato as point man of the attack. And Newell was sharp, racking up two assists—including one on a Vesey third-period strike that upped the lead to three—while helping the Crimson improve its puck possession in the attacking zone, an area in which Harvard had struggled over the past few contests.
“We’re always searching for different combinations, and I think we’ll continue to switch—I don’t think one recipe is going to be good throughout the year,” Donato said. “But I thought the power play was persistent today. [It] didn’t click right away, but we were getting some good looks.”
The Crimson failed to convert any of its power-play opportunities in the opening period, but its three trips to the man advantage offered Harvard a change of pace from 5-on-5 play, which Notre Dame dominated for the bulk of the first. The Fighting Irish generated six of the game’s first eight shots, but Crimson sophomore goaltender Merrick Madsen—who made 29 saves in his fourth start of the year—stopped all six to keep his side in contention.
Notre Dame would eventually strike first, however, as assistant captain Mario Lucia’s slapshot from the top of the right circle at 10:30 in the first period put the hosts in front. Rookie defenseman Bobby Nardella picked up an assist on the play, one of two on the night for the Irish’s seventh defenseman.
Nonetheless, only one of Nardella’s helpers went to one of the men in gold. While attempting to track down the puck in his own zone with less than five minutes to play in the first, Nardella coughed up possession alongside the goalmouth, offering rookie forward Lewis Zerter-Gossage an opportunity to pounce on the loose puck.
The freshman made use of the early Christmas gift, coming from behind the net to rip the puck past Petersen for his first collegiate goal, giving the Crimson new life after a slow start.
Following the blunder, Notre Dame went on to commit eight more penalties, making things increasingly more difficult for the Irish penalty kill tasked with stopping the nation’s second-best power-play unit.
“They do a good job of moving the puck,” Notre Dame coach Jeff Jackson said. “They’ve got five big-time forwards on that top unit, so when they move the puck, they have good instincts, they pass the puck well, and they break you down.”
The Crimson and RPI will face off in an all-ECAC tournament final tomorrow afternoon at 4:05 p.m. Notre Dame and Western Michigan will play in the consolation game at 7:35 p.m.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Familiar faces will be pitched against each other this weekend in Minnesota, as the No. 8/8 Harvard women’s ice hockey team (7-1-1, 5-1-1 ECAC) travels to Duluth, Minn. to take on the No. -/10 University of Minnesota-Duluth Bulldogs (5-9-0, 3-7-0 WCHA) in a pair of non-conference tilts.
While this weekend will be the first time the squads have matched up since 2006, there will be plenty of familiarity between the two benches, as Harvard coach Katey Stone and the Crimson will be reunited with old members of the women’s hockey program.
New UMD head coach Maura Crowell served as an associate head coach at Harvard for five years, while assistant coaches Laura Bellamy ’13 and Samantha Reber ’15 played for the Crimson–with the former also serving as an assistant for Harvard–prior to joining the Bulldogs.
“Their coaches have been a huge part of our program in years past,” co-captain Michelle Picard said. “It will be great to see them again obviously, but at the same time they’re our opponents this weekend…. We’re both two talented teams and this weekend will be a battle.”
The Crimson will look to continue its seven game win streak, and go in to the weekend on a wave of momentum after blanking out No. 4/4 Northeastern, 3-0, at home on Tuesday.
After struggling to find its rhythm early on in the season, the Harvard offense has roared to life, outscoring its opponents 25 to six in the past seven games after finding the net just three times in the first three games. Senior forward Miye D’Oench has led the way, amassing six goals and 12 points for a front line unit that has seen five different players score more than one goal so far.
A large part of this surge has been due to the increased comfort the players have experienced playing with each other as the season progresses, particularly the rookie members of the squad.
“We’re at a point where we’ve had our lines pretty much the same and we’re getting to know each other,” junior forward Sydney Daniels said. “We have a lot of freshman on the team who are getting more comfortable with the system…. They’re familiarity is helping us generate offensive momentum.”
The Crimson go into this weekend’s matchups averaging just short of three goals a game, good for 11th in the nation, while the Bulldogs have conceded almost as many goals a game.
Harvard’s depth will be a key asset in exploiting one of the weaker backlines in the nation, as 14 different players have chipped in at least one point so far this season. Having various athletes that can continue to produce has made the Crimson a dangerous team to play against regardless of who is on the ice.
“Depth is a big part of our game,” Picard said. “No matter who we have on the ice, they’ll get the job done, which means that we’ve got a lot of people that can play a lot of minutes and everyone gets to stay fresh and put their best foot forward when they get on the ice.”
While the Harvard offense has found its spark, the defense continues to exert itself against its opponents. After keeping NCAA goals leader Kendall Coyne and a potent Northeastern attack in check on Tuesday, the Crimson improved to a mere 0.89 goals allowed per game, good for second in the nation.
Picard and co-captain Emerance Maschmeyer have led the charge for Harvard. While Picard has kept the defense steady, particularly against the power play–the Crimson is fourth in the nation in penalty kills percentage–Maschmeyer has continued her stellar play in goal.
The Bruderheim, Alberta native has conceded less than a goal per game, only one of two goaltenders to do so, and is currently top in the nation with a .976 save percentage. The senior is 174 saves away from becoming the all-time saves leader in Harvard history after passing Christina Kessler ’10 recently.
With the Crimson squad firing on all cylinders right now, Harvard heads into the weekend in good shape and will look to head back into conference play with their perfect nonconference record intact.
Though there will be some intrigue surrounding the game due to the reunion between the Crimson and a few of its coaches and players, the squad maintains that they go into this game with the same approach it has going into every other game.
“Every game we come in and try to play the same way but I think going against former Crimson coaches and players will be a little bit weird, to see them out there,” Daniels said. “But after warmups… It’ll just be another game with another coach and another team.”
