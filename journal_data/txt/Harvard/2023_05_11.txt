“As long as you can still grab a breath, you fight. You breathe. Keep breathing.” —Hugh Glass, “The Revenant”
When you try to breathe in the air at the top of Mount Kilimanjaro, you fill your lungs with roughly half as much oxygen as you would at sea level. This can lead to altitude sickness, which is a friendly way of saying that your brain and all other vital organs begin to malfunction, simulating — and sometimes actually precipitating — suffocation.
“I didn’t feel like I was in my body,” Nicholas C. Ige ’25 recalled from the summit push.
What was once an introspective and meditative walk became something far more intense, where not breathing meant his vision failed and not moving meant falling over from dizziness. But Nick is an atypical human being, forged in the crucible of war alongside countless others for whom giving up was not an option.
Nick adopted a reverent tone at this point in the interview, leaning forward in his war room seat to regale me with the miraculous tale of Oliver Campbell — a fellow Army Ranger who was successfully resuscitated after succumbing to injuries sustained in combat. Willing himself to safety while severely wounded, Ollie later recounted simply focusing on his breath — a tactic that kicked in with Nick’s instincts on Kilimanjaro.
“I did not get shot four times in the chest. I was just walking up a fucking big hill with snow on it, but I felt like I was going to die,” Nick said. “And I just remember thinking about that — if you can breathe, you can fight; if you can fight, you can live. I just kept cycling that through my head. I was just trying to give myself any kind of parable to keep walking, because it felt like my whole body was shutting down on me.”
Nick has shared an abundance of stories about his courageous peers with me. It isn’t hard to imagine, however, that many of them have shared their own stories about Nick.
The veteran fails to mention in this interview that he himself is a recipient of a Bronze Star with Valor, as well a Purple Heart — medals awarded for heroic service in combat and being wounded while serving, respectively. Nick has also received the Soldier’s Medal — the most valorous award for efforts in a non-combat environment — for his heroism while off duty. To say that climbing Kilimanjaro was the only obstacle Nick has overcome with poise is a gross understatement.
Also present in the war room for our conversation was Nick’s friend Bianca Braun ’23, who couldn’t help but smile when Nick cited his Ranger ego for willing him to finish the climb or die trying.
“You will never die,” Bianca laughed. “I don’t think you will.”

“The purpose of life is not to be happy. It is to be useful, to be honorable, to be compassionate, to have it make some difference that you have lived and lived well.” —Ralph Waldo Emerson
On his seventh day away from Cambridge, Nick Ige sat — because he could not stand without passing out — atop the tallest summit in Africa and the highest single free-standing mountain in the world, more than 19,000 feet in the sky.
“1/7 peaks done,” the Instagram caption read.
Summiting Kilimanjaro is a monumental milestone. But there is more to the journey than the destination, of course. Each picture in Nick’s camera roll from along the way brought to mind a new lesson learned and a new source of motivation.
Nick frequently praised his team of porters, whose steadfastness never faltered. Eli, the lead guide, climbs the mountain several times a month in minimal gear to support his son going to school. Others on the team are part-time poachers, making do with the volatile returns of ecotourism. In the context of their life circumstances, Nick’s training regimen and self-imposed pressure was “a privilege.”
“‘Oh no, I’m tired.’ Why am I tired?” Nick asked. “I’m tired because I get to learn,” he said. “This portion of the whole trip just put so much into perspective about how grateful I am, or I should be, for the opportunities that are presented to me.”
Hiking enabled Nick to ruminate on these realities and their pertinence to vocation. Previously interested in pursuing a career in research at NASA, which synthesizes his technical training and current education in STEM (and, yes, also paves his way to becoming an astronaut), Nick wondered if a more humanitarian future awaited him.
* * *
“One’s is to defend the dead. / One’s to suffer until ego is shed. / One’s is to dribble the nectar of evil. / One’s but to roll a stone up a hill.” —Tracy K. Smith, “Soulwork”
Nick has grappled with the ramifications of his project countless times: What does it mean to serve once more? Whose lives can he actually improve? “Help” and “impact” are nebulous buzzwords, seldom realized in concrete ways outside the purview of a military career. But somewhere along the harsh, rocky slopes of Kilimanjaro, an idea to expand the Seven Summits project into something greater took shape.
“Study, Adventure, Train,” as it’s tentatively called, is a lifestyle brand in development. Alongside attending Neuroscience classes this semester, Nick has been workshopping this future business endeavor by centering his social media presence around its core goal: Partnering active and outdoor living with scholarship. For the first time since planning to climb, Nick considered the philanthropic potential of owning a company.
“You have attention. The spotlight is now yours. What do you do with that spotlight?” Nick demanded of himself. “The reason I wanted to do this project is really to help other people, and help people on a larger scale.”
Perhaps Nick’s ardent desire to leave the world a better place than he found it has an outlet beyond climbing mountains.
* * *
“‘That is well said,’ replied Candide, ‘but we must cultivate our garden.’” —Voltaire, “Candide”
Thinking about the future can be exhilarating, but also distracting.
Nick is cautious of letting unrealized plans seduce his attention away from climbing, where ideas like “Study, Adventure, Train” are born. After conquering Kilimanjaro, there were only six peaks left to summit, afterall, and Nick only had a few days to celebrate and recharge with Eli before meeting me in Australia, where the next mountain remained unaware of his past accomplishments.
“The mountain gives no fucks who I am,” Nick said. “The mountain is going to keep on doing mountain shit.”
On more than one occasion during our interview, Nick simply stopped talking, letting his pictures of the Tanzanian landscape — the lonesome boulders and all-seeing sun — come to life and fill the room with their own voices. Nick sat still, savoring Kilimanjaro’s apathetic majesty.
Training, studying, and preparation for the next life chapter will always be waiting for him, but some time must be set aside to admire the other giants in this tale.
“The mountain’s not doing that for me. It’s not doing that for anyone. It just is. It’s very indifferent to what it is, and it doesn’t care who’s walking up it or who’s walking down it,” he said. “I think there’s something very beautiful in that.”

“Glory before death, adventure before all.” —Nicholas C. Ige ’25
In need of questions answered, Nick and I approached a lone photographer who sat perched overlooking a trail down to Blue Lake’s edge. A small, untouched oasis nestled within the mountains, and one of just four glacial lakes in continental Australia, Blue Lake certainly commands the gaze of every camera lens in its vicinity. But while the main trail was well populated, Nick and I had ventured far off on an obscure side path — two specks just as secluded among the grassy peaks as Blue Lake itself, joined by another hiker for the first time in some miles.
“Can we swim in that?” Nick asked, pointing across the alpine vista to the turquoise waters. The photographer squinted back, clearly off-put by such a juvenile question.
“You’d be crazy, it’s freezing in there.”
“But we’re allowed to swim in it,” Nick persisted. “Right?”
“You’d be crazy.”
Crazy, but most certainly refreshed. After summiting Mount Kosciuszko and trekking for another 15 miles through the Snowies — the county’s tallest mountain range — the photographer’s endorsement of sanity felt like a worthy price to pay for the freezing embrace of Blue Lake.
Luck, Nick taught me as we ambled down to the water, is actually just the confluence of “opportunity and preparedness.” The opportunity of Blue Lake appeared and Nick and I were prepared (read: crazy enough) to take advantage of it. We were lucky.
And I can assure you, Mr. Photographer, that Nick Ige is indeed crazy and the water was indeed frigid. But as we splashed about, serenaded by the bleats of mountain goats and kissed by the high-altitude breeze, I could not have felt a purer bliss in the entire world.

“I love a sunburnt country, a land of sweeping plains, / Of ragged mountain ranges, of droughts and flooding rains.… Core of my heart, my country! Land of the rainbow gold, / For flood and fire and famine she pays us back threefold.” —Dorothea McKellar, “My Country”
In some respects, climbing the tallest mountain in Australia was only a footnote of my time with Nick.
After meeting in Sydney with a giant bear hug on Jan. 5, we immediately hit the road west and inland for Thredbo — a ski town at the base of Mount Kosciuszko. One night of merriment with the off-season lifties later and we awoke from a sound night of slumber in our Suzuki rental to commence the hike, which we finished before sunset. Within 36 hours of linking with one another, we had successfully traversed the Main Range loop — the most circuitous route one could take to reach the summit of Kosciuszko — and checked a second mountain off Nick’s list. 2/7 peaks done.
I can summarize the rest of our itinerary quite briefly for you: Nick and I left Thredbo that night, heading south until we reached the ocean. For the next week, we weaved our way along the coast heading back east toward Sydney, stopping to surf, drink, and surf a little more in every hole-in-the-wall town we could find — Corryong, Orbost, Eden, Wollongong. After a few final days sampling the delights of the big city, Nick and I parted ways at Sydney Airport. Two weeks later, we were back on Harvard’s campus. The broad strokes almost blur together.
But the schedule, quite frankly, was the least important part. For two people that never seem to stop dealing with schedules — attending classes, labs, practices, and dinners as part of a tightly operated, life-or-death routine — keeping track of time or place was impressively unimportant to us. How, then, can I even go about describing the trip?
Unlike the last two articles, I have no interview to work with — just field notes, photos, and sweet reminiscence. But our travels can only really be recounted as they were at the start of this article, anyway: in vignettes of ineffable joy and sublime tranquility, serendipitous encounters and absurd conversation. To tell you about Nick, Australia, and the mountains demanding our ascent, I think it best to sketch a few scenes.
* * *
“You have never seen such animals as these who without a sound or a sign carry you off. You race with them across the long familiar ground that in that moment seems so glorious, so charged with beauty, strange.” —Joy Williams, “The Quick and the Dead”
You’ll grasp quite rapidly from this article that Nick has a propensity to submerge himself in any body of water within sight. We are alike in this way, Nick and I.
After celebrating the successful hike with another serene night of sleep in the Suzuki, Nick and I set off the next morning in our fortress of dreams for Lakes Entrance — the first town on our coastal wishlist. Not far into the journey, however, Nick spotted a roadside creek that beckoned us to don swimsuits and adjourn the drive.
Once on the bank it took me slightly more convincing to dive in given the lack of cell service, our distance to civilization, and the unusually high number of venomous species in Australia, many of which are waterborne — 66, to be exact, which doesn’t include non-venomous but still deadly animals. But I also remembered I was accompanied by Nick, who I would bet has a 50/50 shot at winning a fight with a crocodile. Not ideal chances, but not bad enough to stop us from swimming and skipping rocks to our hearts’ content.
A few days later in the town of Bermagui, a barista recommended we investigate the Blue Pool (which, it seems, was named in the same unique convention as Blue Lake) — a swimming pool carved into the town’s coastal cliff face. We weren’t satisfied with a mere afternoon basking with locals, so we returned to Blue Pool the next morning for a polar plunge. I only just dipped in, pacing back and forth for a few seconds while shivering frantically. Nick sat perfectly still for three straight minutes.
He told me once that he prefers journaling in the morning because “you’re influenced” at the end of the day, but not immediately when you wake up. I gather that Nick was practicing a kind of journaling at Blue Pool, expressing gratitude and setting his intention for the day. I learned, watching in silence, that there are times for splashing and times for centering.
* * *
“They’d be into some more good waves the next morning, but they couldn’t help but think back to the many things they’d already seen and done.” —Bruce Brown, “The Endless Summer”
Beyond streams and pools, Nick and I also found time to enjoy the larger bodies of water around us. Renting surfboards was a finicky process, but we managed, pausing our road trip when the opportunity presented itself. No schedule, no worries.
The people in Australia, and the beachgoers in particular, were remarkably friendly. Even the grumpiest individual we encountered — a water sports shop manager in Merimbula — lit up when we discussed the overlap between Australian and Californian beach cultures. Joy cannot help but bubble to the surface when you catch a whiff of surfboard wax in the air, when you hear the ocean thrumming just on the other side of a sand dune and know that you’ll soon be able to watch the sunlight glitter on a swell like a thousand tiny jewels.
Nick is a far better surfer than I, but this doesn’t matter to him. Surfing, as he told me at a crowded beach in Sydney, is more of a “vibe” or a “mindset” than a skill. It isn’t hard to watch Nick glide across a cresting wave, throwing up a shaka and a smile before gently tumbling into the water, and think to yourself that he does not perfectly epitomize that vibe.
When we first arrived in Bermagui a few days prior, Nick and I popped into a surf shop, already in a giggly mood after walking past a recreational cricket game in the local park and not understanding anything happening. Nick and the owner struck up a conversation, in pleasant agreement about how silly it is for self-proclaimed experts to consider some surfboard types illegitimate.
Listening to their mirthful exchange evoked a similar feeling to the one that touched me in Merimbula — a chimerical longing for tranquility and adrenaline at once. Many times throughout the trip, there came a euphoria for having witnessed nature in action, for having witnessed myself become small. I don’t believe surfers are chasing anything but that feeling.
“It was meant to be fun,” the shop owner concluded with a smile. “Always was.”

“God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.” —Winnifred Crane Wygal, “Serenity Prayer”
In the spring of my freshman year, I was diagnosed with anorexia. The story of college for me, at its core, has been about asking where Charlie went and finding him again.
I can confidently say that my relationship with my body is healthier now than it has been in a long time. This does not mean, however, that the obsessive thoughts are completely gone, that the wounds aren’t still raw, or that questions remain unanswered. I am continuing to climb and suspect that, to some degree, I always will be.
When Nicholas C. Ige ’25 and Kevin Fischetto ’26 first approached me in the fall, I was immediately drawn to their project for this reason. They offered a solution to my dark days and responses to my endless volley of questions. I disclosed this with Nick a few miles after leaving Charlotte’s Pass, the trailhead for Mount Kosciuszko, and in turn he shared with me the somber contingencies of leaving the army — anger, losing your closest friends to self-harm, breaking down when you watch a particularly realistic war movie. Nick, ever the open book, will share all of this if you ask.
On our afternoon in Bermagui, we asked a fisherman at Blue Pool where the best bars were. He assured us that the drinking demographic of the 1,500-person town always flocks to “the Bermy pub,” so that evening we ate, drank, and rubbed elbows with Bermagui’s finest. Nick has told me countless times that to fight back against depressive thoughts and win, you must simply “do hard shit.” But that night, it occurred to me to ask Nick a new question: “Do you believe in free will?”
Nick paused, took a sip from his lager, and encouraged me to think back to Blue Lake and what luck really means, to consider more fully the significance of opportunity and preparedness. Much is out of our control, but how capable we are of responding is not. Self-doubt, impatience, hatred — all seem so trivial when you’ve run a dozen miles before 9 a.m., or better yet, when you’ve spent the entire day outdoors with a friend.
By chance, there sat a playground with swings across the street from the Bermy pub that many pints had rendered deeply enticing. It just so happened that the same thought struck another four geezers from the pub, and so by sheer accident, Nick and I made four new friends, swinging and sending laughs into the balmy evening air long past the pub’s closing. By the time Nick and I walked the short distance back to the Suzuki, parked on top of a cliff overlooking Blue Pool, the clouds had cleared and we had the good fortune of viewing a full moon before drifting off to sleep.
There was so much spontaneity to attend to — so many jokes to crack and smiles to share, so much fresh air to breathe and moonlight to swim in — that I ran out of questions to ask that night. The dark days, as luck would have it, felt so very far away.
* * *
“I am scared, and want to love so hard, I want to love and be loved. But until then I am alone.” —Nick Ige, Dec. 3 journal entry
It’s difficult to overstate just how much Nick and I talked about over the course of the trip. There was plenty of silence, sure, but the two of us were quite rarely outside spitting distance of one another the entire time. And when you’re on a road trip with someone as storied as Nick, you find yourself covering all kinds of unexpected ground.
That this would be a discussion-based trip was established on the first day. Deftly maintaining conversation while adjusting to driving on the other side of the road, Nick enlightened me about the training Rangers must endure, their odd fraternal rituals, how depoliticized war feels in live combat, the mission on which he earned both his Bronze Star and Purple Heart medals, the time he rescued two people from a burning house without protective gear while off duty, and how he still tenses up slightly when he sees “ambush trees” — the kind of cover that assailants in Afghanistan would often spring from — alongside the road, among other things. And that was just in the first two hours.
We proceeded to discuss how deployment changed his perspective on religion, the various spiritual leaders we’ve had in our lives, and open-mindedness as a kind of religious practice. Conversation petered out as night fell because we had to keep a lookout for kangaroos jumping onto the road.
But thankfully these conversations extended beyond the car. Over breakfast, we discussed the pitfalls of the American two-party system and what characteristics you should look for in a long-term partner; over lunch, his tattoos and our relationships with our families; over dinner, the social scene at Harvard and ideas for my thesis.
Nick is an unapologetic person and we disagree on many things, but rarely have I felt my lived experience received so respectfully and my opinions pondered so deliberately. Assumptions were always checked at the Suzuki door, and leaning into empathy was a consistent theme of the trip. Of course, anyone who eats in the Cabot House dining hall and sees Nick chatting with someone new at every meal could probably guess something similar. Loving life so fully entails loving the people in it.
* * *
“I am granite reorganized, a formation—: yet forming. I dream with the mountain because I am of the mountain. … I was dreamed into being—: I was the dreamer.” —Natalie Diaz, “Duned”
You won’t be surprised to learn that Nick has continued to push himself physically and mentally this semester, running self-timed marathons regularly. In February, he ran 37 miles across Cape Cod. Over spring break, he notched a cool 50-mile run in Puerto Rico.
Ultramarathons are part of his training to tackle Mount Denali in Alaska — the next mountain on his list and the tallest from base-to-peak on the planet, only third in total elevation behind Asia’s Mount Everest and South America’s Mount Aconcagua. Nick plans to begin climbing Denali on May 18, just days after the semester ends, but you can support him now by contributing to his GoFundMe, which you can find on his Instagram bio.
Injuries, travel expenses, and LS1b problem sets are always emerging to obstruct Nick’s progress, but he continues to find new sources of inspiration. Nick is a magnet for similarly ambitious training partners, who accompany him in the weight room and on his runs. His Instagram page is overflowing with uplifting comments from friends and distant supporters alike. Nick and his project possess an unmistakable gravity, one felt within his communities on campus and also far beyond them.
The mission is to promote student mental health and veterans’ education. Nick has come far, but five more peaks and countless memories await him.

“Where is that real, unconditional, nourishing something? How can I be good to others and good to myself, one with body and one with mind? Make this part of your Constitution, Charlie. Somewhere between Sunlight and Mountain, heart and soul, worries dissolve as though they never existed.” —Charles W. McCormick ’24, Jan. 12 journal entry
Late in April, I visited Nick in his room to chat about these articles. I walked in to see gear sprawled everywhere and Nick lying like a mummy in a bivy sack on the floor, taking stock of his equipment before he leaves campus. The goofiness clearly never left.
But it’s been a long semester, and we are both tired. I’m in a rut with final papers looming. Nick shared that he’s been feeling undisciplined as the year comes to a close. Not one to dwell on negative feelings, however, he reminded me that the mountaintops are that much sweeter when you’ve experienced the valleys. In the moments we are tested, we also see growth.
Nick let me skim through his journal from winter break to find quotes while he packed. I’m never quite sure how to end my entries when I write, but Nick always signs his off with a brief message: “Nick, lead with love” or “Nick, plan your victory.” These little reminders anchor his writing, prescribing something to focus on until he opens his journal again.
I think it best to end this article with some reminders of his. I look forward to hearing all about Denali the next time I see him, and I can’t wait to pass his stories along to you. Maybe I’ll even have some more questions answered. But until then, dear reader,
“Seize your chance to grow,”
“Rebuild your trust with yourself,”
“No longer let fear stop you,”
“You are in the journey, keep going,”
“Love yourself, and let it be free.”

Hip-hop and classical music are in many ways at odds with each other, often falling at opposite ends on the music spectrum. Perhaps that’s why it’s hard to imagine a rapper being embraced in a world where classical elitism shuns outsiders. However, Moroccan-French pianist, producer, and composer Sofiane Pamart is changing that narrative for good.
The classically-trained French pianist has had his fair share of success in both worlds. Having worked with household names like Scylla, Dinos, Laylow, and Vald, Pamart’s earlier discography is peppered with gold and platinum records for his collaborations on rap albums. That’s not to say his love for classical music has waned in any way. More recently, his work on hip-hop albums like 2018’s “Pleine Lune” has given way to contemporary classical ones like his 2019 studio debut “PLANET,” which was shortly followed by its deluxe edition “Pamart: PLANET GOLD” in 2020. Besides receiving a gold medal during his time at Conservatoire de Lille, Pamart has received critical acclaim for “PLANET,” which was certified gold record in France last year — and just this morning, he got word that the album received certified gold record abroad.
Following the 2022 release of Pamart’s latest album “LETTERS,” the rapper/pianist sat down with The Harvard Crimson to talk about the album, his relationship with fans, and future projects.
When asked about the inspiration behind “LETTERS,” Pamart credited his travels in Asia.
“The feeling of the emergency of a place that I discover triggers something inside me that is very powerful. And I can use it to go on the piano and explain everything I have in my heart,” Pamart said.
In contrast to his debut album, which Pamart said was about “questioning what was [his] identity, what was the music [he] would love to bring to the world,” “LETTERS” is all about discovering his growing fanbase and giving back to them for their ceaseless support.
“The process of composition of ‘LETTER’ was to be grateful, to be thankful to, to my audience. And trying to tell them a lot of things without words,” Pamart said. “I wanted to dedicate something in my discography only for them.”
From the moment Pamart sits down to compose or produce to when an album gets released, every note comes from inspiration.
“It always starts from something that I experienced. It can be a situation, a meeting, a landscape, or something that I find very inspiring and is emotionally strong enough to become music,” Pamart said. “When this happens, I stop playing and I become myself instantly.”
Pamart is also influenced by years of classical training. That foundation of classical perfectionism always finds its way back into his music — oftentimes in unwarranted ways.
“I start to overthink, I start to make it more complicated. I start to add layers that make the song more interesting in an intellectual way,” Pamart said. “When I reach that point, I destroy the song, because I think the secret of a beautiful story in wordless music is to be very emotional.”
It’s there, amidst that introspective creative process, that Pamart settles on a title for his compositions.
“The naming of the song is very important for me,” he said. “Like ‘LOVE’ was obvious. ‘SOLITUDE’ was obvious. Because it's obvious words and obvious feelings.”
But when it comes to the ephemeral and indescribable vulnerability behind some of the melodies, describing that in words can get complicated. In these cases, each song becomes imbued with layers of meaning, coming to life in more ways than one.
“Like ‘FROM,’ for example. How can you express “FROM” in a musical way?” he asked. “I try asking myself, maybe I can think about where I come from? How do we arrive at composing a song? Where does it come from?”
Using emotions as leitmotifs in his music is a lesson Pamart learned through his collaborations with rappers.
“I understood that when I’m working with them, I need to focus only on what makes them react emotionally,” Pamart said. “I needed to quit the classical world and the way they think to make my music more emotional.”
Speaking of his most recent collaboration, “Tulum, México,” Pamart fondly recalled how the project came together with close friend and industry giant, Josman.
“[Josman] asked me what are you doing next month? And I said I'm doing my South America tour,” Pamart said, to which Josman replied; “If we finish this song by the end of the session, I will book my tickets and join you in Mexico.”
Since then, the song has gone viral — a feat which Pamart credits to how much fun they had in making it.
“If you are very sincere about something you give to music, it's crazy. It's impressive how people feel it.”
That bond Pamart shares with his fans dates back to 2019. Due to Covid restrictions, Pamart couldn’t perform live for much of his career thus far — much to the frustration of his newfound fanbase. Despite the distance, his online audience continued to grow.
“There was so much anxiety in the air and so much unknown happening that we were fighting together,” Pamart recalled. “We were helping each other to handle our emotions in this situation.”
“As soon as we could do gigs, I got my first gig in Montreux Jazz Festival,” he said. “I met my audience there, and it was crazy, you know. It was my first show ever as a solo artist.”
Performing at Montreux was just the beginning for Pamart’s rise to fame. The very next year, Pamart became the first pianist in history to sell out the Accor Arena Bercy. In 2022 he became the first artist to play an entire concert live under the northern lights of Lapland.
“I saw the Northern Lights twice in my life. The first time I was playing under them, and the second time, the day after, I was watching them, still in the emotion of what we just accomplished,” Pamart said. “People cried in the team. It was so magical.”
Pamart has certainly kept himself busy. Every year since his 2019 studio debut, the musician has consistently put out an album. Now, fresh off the heels of his big North and South American tour, 2023 is shaping up to be a monumental year for the musician. When asked if fans can expect more tour dates this year, Pamart was enthusiastic.
“I'm focused on this part of my career, on sharing my music to all the world,” Pamart said. “My first album is ‘PLANET.’ I didn't want to play it for some of the people on this planet. I want to play it for everyone.”
Indeed, every decision that brought him this far is building towards the big vision Pamart has for his legacy — a process that he envisions lasting for another “50 years at least.”
“I want this journey to be worldwide. I want the music to destroy all the boundaries.”
Pamart has dared to do what few have done before: to push the boundaries of what classical music can be. By changing what one can accomplish through classical music, it’s safe to say that not only is he changing the landscape of music now, he’s also paving the way for an entire future generation of musicians.
