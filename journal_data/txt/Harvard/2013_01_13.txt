After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Unless you've been in a coma for the past ten months, you've probably heard about "Girls," which premieres its second season tonight on HBO. You've also probably heard as much about the polarized opinions surrounding Lena Dunham—the show's 26-year-old writer, director, executive producer, and star—as you have about the show's portrayal of hookup culture and twenty-something life.
Twenty-nothing life would be more appropriate; the show is as bleak as it is witty. Dunham's depiction of New York City presents a stark contrast to the glittery, urban playground of "Sex and the City"—these girls are more likely to pregame with PBR than with 10 dollar cosmopolitans. The maelstrom of criticism and praise that has surrounded the show, impressively, makes the obsessive navel-gazing of its characters look like normal introspection by comparison.
Perhaps the intense media chatter is due to the fact that "Girls" is one of the first shows to hold a (decidedly unglamorous) mirror up to current young adult life—and perhaps the vitriol is a knee-jerk reaction to disliking this reflection.
It's also possible that the controversy comes as a result of the fact that Dunham herself leads a life that's a far cry from those of her characters, being much more successful and ambitious than they are. Additionally, Dunham has been the lucky recipient of numerous irrelevant and depressingly sexist personal attacks, most notably regarding her weight. An ambitious woman? Oh no! A full-figured woman in a nude scene? The horror!
There's also the part where all the girls of "Girls" are white, which hasn't sat well with many bloggers and critics. But the reality is that the majority of television shows are primarily populated by Caucasians. This is a problem, but it's not a problem that "Girls" started, and it's something that Dunham has promised to address in this upcoming season.
Speaking of representation, consider this: in the 100-top grossing movies of 2008 and 2009, women held only 33% of speaking roles.
There are more frightening facts, such as how few shows and films pass the requirements of the Bechdel test: (1) there are two female characters, (2) who talk to each other (3) about something other than a man. "Girls," though, does pass the Bechdel test, and its female-focused cast is a step away from the gender imbalance that plagues popular entertainment.
But social justice doesn't seem like the point. Regardless of the lifestyle it presents and whether or not you subscribe to it, "Girls" is well-crafted and smart, which is a rare find in modern television.  If you feel otherwise, well, HBO GO is free for all Harvard students, so you can decide for yourself.
This season, we hope for more watching and less squawking.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To wrap up its two-day trip to the nation’s capital, the Harvard wrestling team made the short drive to College Park, Md. to take on No. 23 Maryland and Stanford in two dual matches.
After losing, 21-19, to American on Friday night, the Crimson opened up on Saturday against the Terrapins. Despite having the lead at the midway point, Harvard was unable to hang on, falling by a final of 22-14.
But the Crimson stormed back a few hours later and dismantled the Cardinal to coast to a 28-9 victory.
“I think that we wrestled really well this weekend,” co-captain Steven Keith said. “The loss to Maryland was a tough, close match where a couple things could’ve gone differently, and we [would have won] that match against the No. 23 team in the country. We rebounded really well and just annihilated Stanford, so it was a really good way to finish the weekend.”
Harvard received solid performances from Keith and fellow co-captain Walter Peppelman, who both went undefeated on the day. The only seniors to take the mat, Keith contributed a shutout and a fall, and Peppelman demonstrated similar consistency to win his matches by a combined score of 21-2.
“[Keith and Peppelman] both wrestled strong,” Crimson coach Jay Weiss said. “I tell the seniors, this is the last time they’re doing this, so you have to treat every time like it’s the last time, and they’re doing that. They’re doing a nice job.”
HARVARD 28, STANFORD 9
A team effort from start to finish gave Harvard its sole victory of the weekend. The outcome was all but decided by the midway point, as the Crimson held a commanding 17-3 lead over Stanford.
Harvard would go on to further expand its lead, ultimately winning by 19 points. The 28 points were the most scored by the Crimson since Jan. 7 of last year and came after two consecutive losses.
“It’s a huge thing to learn [how to bounce back],” Weiss said. “When we get into tournament situations, you have to be able to push that away and have a short term memory. They really wrestled a lot better [against the Cardinal].”
Harvard won seven of the ten bouts, and held Stanford to three-point decisions in its three losses.
Every match, with the exception of Keith’s, who achieved a fall, went the distance, and Crimson wrestlers took advantage of a number of takedowns to keep the scoring high and secure bonus points for the team.
Peppelman, junior Cameron Croy, and sophomore James Fox all secured major decisions and held their opponents to three points or fewer. Keith’s fall at 2:00 racked up even more bonus points.
The victories were the 98th and 94th career wins for Peppelman and Keith, respectively. The two co-captains currently rank sixth and seventh on the program’s all-time wins list.
MARYLAND 22, HARVARD 14
A few hours earlier, Harvard took to the mat against host Maryland. Although the Crimson found itself in the lead at the midway point, the Terrapins won the final four matches to capture a 22-14 dual victory.
Five of the ten Maryland wrestlers to take the mat were ranked in the top 25. The two ranked Harvard competitors, Keith and Peppelman, are both listed as No. 11 in their respective weight classes.
“I think that we let the match slip away [against the Terrapins],” Weiss said. “I think we outwrestled them. Sometimes guys just didn’t have enough points. But I think we were right in that match and it was our match to win, which is disappointing.”
Freshman Jeff Ott started off strong for the Crimson and picked up a 3-0 victory over Shane Gentry, ranked 17th in the nation, at 125 lbs.
After sophomore Ryan Osleeb was pinned, Keith tied the score at six apiece with a 7-0 win.
A few minutes later, Harvard took the lead by winning two consecutive major decisions, as Peppelman and freshman Devon Gobbo defeated their opponents by a combined score of 23-3.
Although the Crimson found itself up five, Maryland roared right back, scoring 13 points in the last four matches to overcome the Harvard lead and secure the victory.
The Crimson finished 1-2 on the weekend, but the team gained valuable dual match experience and demonstrated its ability to bounce back in the face of adversity.
“I think we’re in great shape going forward,” Keith said. “We have some tough matches coming up that I think we can win, and I’m really excited with where we are and where we’re headed.”

The No. 2 Harvard women’s ice hockey team extended its unbeaten streak to 11 games with an easy 4-0 win over Quinnipiac Saturday.
In its second straight shutout—and eighth of the season—the Crimson (13-1-1, 11-0 ECAC) came out firing and didn’t slow down, handing the Bobcats (12-9-2, 8-5-1 ECAC) their second consecutive conference loss.
Since opening its season with a 2-0 win over Quinnipiac, Harvard has consistently sat atop the ECAC standings, but the Bobcats—who were in second place coming into the matchup and have now dropped to third—had a chance to jump into the top spot with a victory. A repeat performance of the shutout in October ensured the Crimson sole possession of the league lead for another day.
“We’re better now than we were then,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “We played good defense, we had good goaltending, and we worked our way up the ice. We used our speed last night, so that made a big difference.”
It took Harvard 10 shots to find the back of the net and break the 0-0 tie.  With less than three minutes left in the first period, junior forward Kalley Armstrong picked up the rebound off a shot by co-captain forward Jillian Dempsey and beat Quinnipiac goaltender Victoria Vigilante for Armstrong’s sixth goal of the season.
The Bobcats senior goaltender was a presence in the goal, making 26 saves as the Crimson pounded the net. Despite laying out and making tough stops that kept Harvard off the board for most of the first period, Vigilanti couldn’t keep up with a dominant Crimson offense.
From the first goal on, the Crimson dominated the possession game, outshooting the Bobcats 30 to 18 on the night. Dempsey added her 18th goal of the season early in the second period, receiving a pass across the goal from junior forward Lyndsey Fry that sent Vigilanti sprawling. A quick slap shot put Harvard up, 2-0.
“We played really well as a team,” said Fry, who had two assists in back-to-back games for the first time this season. “We got the shots through that we needed to get through and had people going really hard to the net.”
Five minutes into the third period, the Crimson once again took advantage of a loose puck when freshman forward Miye D’Oench found the net after a shot deflected off Vigilanti’s pads. Nine minutes later, D’Oench fed sophomore forward Samantha Reber to cap off Harvard’s four-point win.
“[The back-to-back wins are] obviously a great way to start the New Year,” Fry said. “We’re definitely showing our league as well as the rest of the country that we’re not stopping just because it’s the New Year. We’re going to keep going, and these wins were huge.”
Freshman goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer tallied 18 saves en route to her third shutout of the season. Maschmeyer’s 95.1 save percentage is second in the nation, behind only co-captain Laura Bellamy.
The Crimson failed to convert two power play opportunities but continued to look invincible in the penalty kill with a perfect 4-for-4 record. Quinnipiac’s best look came midway through the third period with sophomore defender Sarah Edney in the penalty box for hooking, but Maschmeyer and the Harvard defense fended off four consecutive shots by the Bobcats to improve its nation-leading penalty kill percentage to 96 percent.
Despite having dismantled its ECAC opponents thus far—outscoring them 49-4—Stone emphasized the importance of not discounting any team. The matchup with the Bobcats was the 16th of a 30-game season, and Harvard has 11 conference contests left to play.
“Every game is critical to us, and we take them one at a time,” Stone said. “We don’t look past anybody, and I think that’s what keeps up playing in the moment. It’s a long season, and if you get too far ahead of yourself, that’s when you get yourself in trouble.”
Coming off Friday’s 3-0 win against Princeton, Stone said that she was happy to see the level of play improve. Despite getting the win, the Crimson struggled to create scoring opportunities, a far cry from its 9-1 rout of the Tigers at the beginning of the season.
“Our goal today was to be better than we were yesterday, just as it is to be better on Tuesday than we were today,” Fry said. “A cool thing about hockey and our league is that on any given day, anybody can win, and that’s why we have to work for everything we get.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Saturday night’s contest between the Houston Rockets and the Philadelphia 76ers saw two teams both looking to end skids.
After ringing in the New Year with a victory over a struggling Lakers team, Philadelphia had been unable to notch another game in the win column, while Houston looked to end its own streak of back-to-back losses. With a little help from a three-day break and poor defense by Houston, it was the Sixers that snapped its five-game losing streak, topping the Rockets, 107-100.
Jrue Holiday put up the first five points for Philadelphia and never looked back, finishing with a game-high 30 points on 11-of-22 shooting. The Sixers led by as much as 14 in the third quarter, but James Harden brought Houston within three with six minutes to go.
But the effort by the guard, who led the Rockets on the night with 29 points and nine rebounds, wasn’t enough as Houston missed its next eight shots to allow Philadelphia to take the win.
Jeremy Lin '10 had a +/- of +8 but failed to be as efficient as his teammates when he was on the court, only sinking two of his 13 shots for seven points. The Rockets struggled from downtown, missing 24 of 32 attempts, including eight consecutive misses in the final frame. Lin clanged all three of his treys while teammate Chandler Parsons netted only one of his seven attempts behind the arc.
With the loss, Houston, which played its fourth game in five days, falls to seventh place in the Western Conference, eight games behind the first-place Thunder.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women's basketball team earned its sixth straight win against Dartmouth on Saturday afternoon at Lavietes Pavilion. A combined 41 points from junior Christine Clark and senior Victoria Lippert powered their team over the Big Green (2-13, 0-1 Ivy), 88-66. The Crimson (10-5, 1-0 Ivy) led by as much as 31 points in the victory.
“The game itself I thought was really great,” sophomore guard Ali Curtis said. “We came out strong and I thought we fought the whole time. Dartmouth always gives us a good run for our money during Ivy League conference play.”
Clark recorded a game-high 22 points on 8-of-11 shooting and was a perfect five-for-five from the charity stripe. Lippert contributed 19 and hit all three of her free throw attempts. She sits atop the Ivy League in free throw percentage at 89.2 percent.
The third double-digit scorer for Harvard was freshman guard Shilpa Tummala, who put up 10 points in her Ancient Eight debut, a career-high. The 5'11” rookie entered the game late in the first half and played for just eight minutes total, but shot 4-of-4 from the field, including two three-pointers.
“It was nice to finally start clicking for myself on the court,” Tummala said. “It made me feel a little more confident. My teammates definitely have helped with that and are always pushing me in practice and helping me stick through it.... It felt good to be able to help contribute to the team in whatever way I could.”
Tummala, who was two-time captain at St. Mary's High School which was ranked No. 1 by ESPN, scored her first career basket Jan. 2 against Massachusetts.
“Shilpa is a great player,” Curtis said. “Coming in she had great stats. She had a good following through high school. We knew she was going to be an integral part of our team and coming off the bench last night she was feeling good, feeling confident. She didn't even look at the basket when she shot—it just always seemed to go in and it was great for her.”
In addition to Clark and Lippert's performances, it was a strong day for the bench, which contributed 37 points total. Junior guard Jasmine Evans notched eight points while junior center Elise Gordon and senior guard Elle Hagedorn each chipped in six. Hagedorn handed out a team-high four assists, while Curtis added three.
“That in itself shows just how deep our team is, how much everyone wants to win and how important this conference title is to us,” Curtis said. “It was awesome to see everyone get out there, really have fun, and play the game that we love.”
For Dartmouth, its sole senior, guard Faziah Steen, was the dominant shooter of the day. Playing for 34 minutes, she tallied a team-high 18 points and provided defensive pressure, recording a game-high five steals. Steen was followed by freshman Lakin Roland who put up 13 points, and sophomore Tia Dawson, with 10. Dawson was aggressive on the glass, pulling down a game-high nine rebounds.
While Steen drilled an early jumper, it was a pair of Harvard seniors, Lippert and Crimson co-captain Miriam Rutzen, who led the home team on a 13-2 run in the first five-and-a-half minutes of play to bring Harvard out to an early lead it would never relinquish. The team would head into the locker room 16 points on top of its opponents. While hot shooting by Steen and Roland would cut the lead to 11 at its smallest halfway through the second frame, the Crimson went on a 12-0 run to widen the gap and eventually seal the win.
The Crimson hit a total of 10 treys and was able to keep the turnovers down to just nine, below its season average of 17.4 per game. The squad out-rebounded the Big Green, 42-32, with Clark, Lippert and Rutzen each grabbing seven boards. The win is Harvard’s third straight and improved the team to 5-0 at home.
“I think it's just a great start to the Ivy League and sends a message to rest of our team that we're able to take on the conference and do the best we possibly can,” Curtis said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
HANOVER, N.H.—Despite leading a team that occupied the bottom spot in the Ivy standings in 2011-12 by as many as 14 points in the first half, the Harvard men’s basketball team gave up its advantage just before the break on Saturday, entering the locker room down one, 43-42.
After a back-and-forth second period, the defending Ancient Eight champions were able to erase the small deficit and pull away, 75-65, but—like so many contests at Leede Arena—it didn’t come easy. The second half featured six ties and five lead changes, with neither team going ahead by more than five until Harvard (9-5, 1-0 Ivy) scored eight of the last 10 to claim the final, 10-point advantage.
“We hit a stretch where we didn’t play up to our standards,” said freshman point guard Siyani Chambers, who scored a game-high 22 points. “We relaxed, didn’t play good defense, [and] we didn’t get any rebounds…. Other than that stretch, I think we played pretty well. But we can’t have those stretches anymore.”
Although the Crimson has topped the Big Green (3-11, 0-1) in its last seven contests and holds a 9-2 record against Dartmouth with coach Tommy Amaker at the helm, Harvard has traditionally struggled in contests played in Hanover.
The Crimson has held the advantage in both locations under Amaker, but the average Harvard margin of victory at home is 14.2 points compared to 4.8 at Leede Arena. Last year, although the Crimson eventually claimed a 54-38 victory, Dartmouth got within five points as late as 13:35 in the second half of the road game. In 2010, Harvard escaped Hanover with a four-point win after trouncing the Big Green by 29 in their matchup at Lavietes Pavilion.
“For whatever reason, many Harvard teams have never fared very well coming here to play,” Amaker said. “It’s always been games like this where you’re trying to figure it out, or games like this where you don’t come out with a victory.”
STEVE’S JOBS
With 1:36 to play in Saturday’s contest, forward Steve Moundou-Missi slammed the ball through the basket, giving his team an eight-point lead and adding an effective exclamation point to a career night. The sophomore scored a season-high 15 points on seven-of-nine shooting.
“I thought his play and his minutes were tremendous for us to give us the boost that he did,” Amaker said.
After entering the contest with 15:26 left to play in the opening frame, Moundou-Missi quickly made an impact, finishing his first layup of the night just 15 seconds later off a pass from co-captain Christian Webster. Moundou-Missi scored nine of his team’s next 15 points, amassing 11 in a stretch on the court that totaled just over five minutes.
Aside from a single made free throw to capitalize on an and-one opportunity midway through the first half, Moundou-Missi scored all of his points in the paint, including three dunks over the course of the night.
“We needed his energy around the rim to finish the basketball [and] to defensive rebound for us,” Amaker said. “I thought his minutes and his presence were outstanding.”
The sophomore contributed a game-high six rebounds—two on offense—in 24 minutes of action. Before Saturday’s matchup, Moundou-Missi averaged just under 16 minutes per game on the season.
ADJUSTMENT BUREAU
After a first half laden with defensive struggles on both ends of the court, Dartmouth and Harvard each made successful adjustments on defense for the second period.
“It was a sensational effort by both teams and our team in particular to clamp down, get the stops, [and] make the plays necessary,” Amaker said.
In the opening frame, junior co-captain Laurent Rivard lit it up from behind the arc, knocking down all four of his three-point attempts, including his team’s final bucket of the half off an assist from sophomore Wesley Saunders. But though Rivard tried twice more from deep in the second frame, his 12 first-half points were all the junior would tally over the course of the game.
The story was the same for the rest of the Harvard team, as Dartmouth limited long-range offensive chances in the second half. After shooting an impressive six of seven from three-point range in the first, the Crimson made just one more shot from deep on six attempts in the final 20 minutes of play, dropping from 85.7 to just 16.7 percent shooting from deep.
Although Harvard struggled on the defensive glass in the first half—Dartmouth tallied nine offensive rebounds and 17 second-chance points in the frame—the Crimson buckled down on defense down the stretch.
“We gave them way too many second shots in the first half,” Chambers said. “[Amaker] was really adamant about making us box out.”
The Big Green added just four more points off of offensive boards after halftime—the same total as Harvard in the frame.
“If you look at the shooting percentages from the first half and the second half, I thought we did a tremendous job with our defense,” Amaker said. “That was one of the bigger keys for us to come out with a win.”
The Crimson pulled down 16 rebounds to Dartmouth’s 11 in the second half after a first half in which the Big Green outrebounded Harvard, 17-9.
“We just toughed it out as a unit,” Chambers said. “There was more talk on the defensive end. We were really focused every possession on trying to get a stop and trying to get a rebound.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the second time in four days, the Harvard men’s hockey team found itself making a late upset bid against a ranked opponent on the road.
But unlike on Wednesday against Boston University, the Crimson’s comeback attempt fell short against No. 12 Dartmouth Saturday night, as a Jesse Blemish goal with under eight minutes remaining gave the Big Green a 3-2 win at Thompson Arena.
The defeat marks Harvard’s sixth in its last eight games and fourth straight against an ECAC opponent. The free-falling Crimson (5-8-1, 3-6-0 ECAC) now finds itself tied for second-to-last place in its conference midway through the season.
“It was a back-and-forth game,” junior defenseman Dan Ford said. “We didn’t play poorly.... It was just a tough Ivy League road game, a one-goal game, [and] Dartmouth made the plays that they needed to [make] to get the win.”
After Harvard rallied to tie the game at two, Beamish scored the go-ahead goal—the first of his career—with 7:29 remaining, tipping a Ryan Bullock shot past Crimson junior goaltender Raphael Girard to send the home crowd of over 4,000 into a frenzy.
Despite a late push, Harvard could not find an answer before the final horn.
“Dartmouth’s a good team,” Girard said. “We sure could have gotten the win out there, but hockey is a game of mistakes.... We can definitely skate with those guys.”
After denying an abundance of early pressure on Girard, the Crimson got on the board first—something it had not done in its last three contests.
At the 13:22 mark of the first period, forward Jimmy Vesey weaved his way through a trio of Big Green (9-5-2, 5-3-1) defenders before scoring from just outside the crease while moving right-to-left.
It was the team-high sixth goal of the season for the rookie, who missed two games last week while playing for the United States at the World Junior Championships in Ufa, Russia.
“Even though [Vesey is] a great player, we can’t just rely on him because he’s only a freshman,” Girard said. “But it was really nice to have him back to create some offense.”
The Harvard defense kept the Big Green off the board for the remainder of the opening period, but Dartmouth’s Matt Lindblad tied things up just over four minutes into the second. During a four-on-four set up by a Vesey facemasking penalty, Lindblad put away a rebound to tie the game.
“They’re a really good transition team,” Girard said. “They want to have some four-on-fours on power plays.... [It gives them] more room on the ice, so it allows their power play to work better, which gives them more chances and more momentum.”
Four minutes later, with 29 seconds still remaining in the major penalty, Nick Bligh put the Big Green ahead, 2-1, with a power-play goal.
After a shot by the hero of Wednesday’s game, senior forward Conor Morrison, hit the post at the period’s end, Dartmouth took that lead into the final period.
But four minutes into the third, the Crimson was able to find the equalizer.
Streaking along the boards on a three-on-two, freshman forward Greg Gozzo centered a pass to Ford, who fired a shot from the right circle that deflected off of Big Green goalie Cab Morris. Sophomore forward Petr Placek was right there for the rebound, which he fired through Morris’ legs to tie the game.
“Placek did a really good job of driving the net hard, which opened things up for me,” Ford said. “He made a great play to stop in front of the net, find the puck, and get a good shot off.”
But Beamish’s goal put Dartmouth ahead minutes later, and Harvard was denied its second straight upset victory.
Girard finished with 27 saves to Morris’ 24. Ford paced the Crimson with four shots, while Eric Robinson and Eric Neiley both had that many for the Big Green, which outshot the Crimson, 30-24, overall.
“We really feel we need to do a better job as a team of blocking shots,” Ford said. “Right now it’s probably one of the things other teams are doing quite a bit better than us. That was definitely the case [Saturday] with Dartmouth. That probably had an impact on some of their goals and its something we’re going to try to get better at as the season goes on.”
