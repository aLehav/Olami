Following the deaths of two of their biggest heroes in the ultimate superhero rager that was “Avengers: Endgame,” the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) had simply too much going on for it to continue as normal. Though there have been spinoffs set in the MCU before, none have tied into the popular movies like they will in Phase Four, with major characters spotlighted in their own series rather than exclusively showing up on the big screen.
The first show in this new phase is “WandaVision,” in which Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany) make their comeback. Vision was last seen dead in “Avengers: Infinity War” and Wanda was last seen speaking with Hawkeye at Tony Stark’s funeral in “Avengers: Endgame.” The show will undoubtedly suck Marvel-deprived audiences in with its 1950s nostalgia and the nitty-gritty details behind characters. While Wanda and Vision, combined, usually get a fifth of the screen time of other MCU leads, by moving their story to a series, creators can expand on plots that are too edgy to be seen anywhere other than television. One can’t help but wonder about the mystery of how this self described “unusual couple” will develop.
The trailer takes place mostly in the ‘50s, music by the Platters underscoring Wanda’s and Vision’s domestic life, portrayed in black and white with a fish-eye lens. Wanda makes Vision appear human, rather than as his android self, and performs household tasks with her powers — reminiscent of Samantha from the 1960s sitcom, “Bewitched.” Wanda hints at a theme of the show early on when she says, “This is our home now. I want us to fit in.” The ‘50s were a time of convention and fitting in, but these aspirations will undoubtedly be made more difficult by Wanda’s and Vision’s superpowers and unconventional relationship.
These scenes elicit evoke an era from decades past while offering eerie contrast as things start to fall apart over the course of the trailer. Could the background song “Twilight Time” also be a nod to “The Twilight Zone”? Different realities have the potential to be quite intriguing.
In the first day of the trailer’s release, it garnered over 53 million viewers, more than eight times the viewership of its debut platform, the Emmys. But if you watched and had no idea what was going on, you’re not alone. The confusing choices seem deliberate, a parallel for characters who don’t seem to know what’s happening either. They look confused by the many time warp events, when time appears manipulated: repeated lines, scene rewinds, and Teyonah Parris’s character, Monica Rambeau, getting thrown through what looks like a time portal. Additionally, when their neighbors ask about where they’re from, they both start to answer and stop short of a real explanation — hinting at the possibility that Wanda’s and Vision’s memories were erased.
The fact that Vision is even alive is also a mystery. The events of the TV show are set to take place after “Avengers: Endgame,” after Vision’s death. Is it possible he’s still dead? The trailer shows a scene with Agnes, their nosy neighbor, (Kathryn Hahn) in which she tells Vision he’s dead. However, the cuts between their exchange makes it come across as a teaser.
The leading theory behind Vision’s role is that Wanda changed reality in an attempt to obtain a happy family, a plot line from Scarlet Witch comics. In another nod to the comics, the trailer teases a special Halloween episode which includes Wanda in her comic book character’s typical superhero suit. And if the The comics also hint at the introduction of the superhero team known as the X-Men, because the franchise just can’t resist a team-up.
Some crazy speculative theories on why Vision is alive: Wanda is trying to rescue Vision, and the ‘50s setting is an exploration of Vision’s consciousness, which is still intact but lost; Wanda raised Vision back from the dead by utilizing their ties to the Mind Stone; the creators are expanding on the parallel universe idea, as first exhibited in “Avengers: Endgame,” and they’re in a universe in which Vision didn’t die.
Scarlet Witch has the most powerful and unpredictable powers out of the Avengers, but she’s only ever appeared in movies with team ups. Being able to center on her powers and explore them more will undoubtedly make for a bewitching series. Additionally, the dreamy nostalgia of past decades and, as the trailer puts it, “Visionary New Age of Television” are on track to make this debut a hit.

“The Ascension,” Sufjan Stevens’ first solo album in five years, is deeply, profoundly, weird.
His songs have always been difficult to describe: They ricochet between worlds of sound as different as Renaissance polyphony and EDM dance-beats in the space of seconds, always with his trademark flair. As a lyricist, his focus on the complexities of his religiosity makes him almost unclassifiable. His music is too deeply intertwined with his belief to lump him in with the aggressively secular indie mainstream, but he steadfastly refuses to be called a “Christian artist,” calling music of that genre “devotional artifice” and “didactic crap.” That label would do him a disservice, anyway, since so much of his music explores the jumbled intersection between the heavenly and the mundane, the divine and the down-to-earth.
“The Ascension” is by far his most ambitious exploration of this juncture yet. Throughout its hour and 20 minutes his faith is never far away: In most of its 15 songs he sings directly to God, and even when he doesn’t his lyrics are suffused with religious imagery. But these are no straightforward hymns of praise, and calling them unconventional would be an understatement. The opening song, for example, asks its addressee — “the Lord himself” — to “move like a centipede.” Though this is an especially jarring simile, much of the album goes further, pushing lyrical boundaries with an astonishing audacity. For the most part, it succeeds, and this radical use of language draws out new meanings instead of mindless provocation.
When Stevens is able to give meaning to lyrics this unexpected, the effect is amazingly destabilizing. “Ativan,” an album highlight, seems to be addressed at times to both God and the titular drug, and Stevens’ blurring the boundaries between recreational drug use and Christian spirituality in lines like “tranquilize me and revise me” is unarming in the best possible sense. There is a boundary-pushing, vivid physicality even in the song’s more conventional sections and, at its extreme, the forthright frankness of “I shit my pants and wet the bed / It takes some time to throw the demons off” conveys much more about a spiritual struggle than any meditation on metaphysics possibly could.
Certainly, this radical approach to religion will not appeal to everyone. Nor will the fact that Stevens — an artist who in the early 2000s dallied with the idea of making 50 albums as a tribute to each US state, filled many of his early songs with good-natured references to signposts of Americana, and has been mostly apolitical, at least explicitly, in his music until now — chose to throw politics into the mix. The album’s last song is called “America,” and here he sings a protest to that country for the first time, with “no shame to admit I no longer believe” in the American dream. This disillusionment with his nation, meaningful and skillfully presented on its own, would feel awkward if not for earlier songs’ hints at the same theme, hints which are only made clear much later.
For all the unexpectedness of the lyrics, Stevens’ music is only more audacious, and in that reckless experimentation lies the album’s real greatness. He pushes the genre-jumping, playfully-experimental attitude of his earlier work still further here and, when it works, the result is equally great. The hyperactive percussion underlying most of the songs is often based not just on a conventional drum-kit or normally synthesized sounds: It draws instead from daily, mundane, “found” noises, like an elevator’s ding or a beeping alarm. Distorted almost beyond recognition by electronic processing, they are collated together into intricate mosaics that stand behind much of the music and are certainly among the highpoints of the album.
Had these been omnipresent, we might have tired of their effect. However, Stevens effectively intersperses sparing, empty textures in between them, allowing our ears a break and forcing us to process their complexity. Some songs, meanwhile, such as “Lamentations” and “Die Happy,” have long stretches of almost no pitch at all, maintaining interest solely on the strength of these sounds. In other places, Stevens electronically manipulates long instrumental interludes into creations that are somehow more expressive because of how contorted they are.
Despite this sort of innovation, he falls back on the same musical devices a bit too frequently. The first song ends with a long, ascending scale backed by a thumping bassline, and it grows almost to a frenzy when the bass suddenly cuts out and we are left with long-lasting lines and ethereal harmonies that fade to the end. It is a wonderful effect the first time it is used, and even the second time as well, but the unexpectedness that lends it this wonder is lost when Stevens leans on it to end his songs as often as he does here. It is an apt musical depiction of lost expectation and disillusionment, but its overuse makes it dull.
Leaving these comparatively minor imperfections aside, though, “The Ascension” is a masterful work. It is not an easy listen: Its lyrical difficulties demand more than a casual hearing, and the atmosphere and impact for which it strives — and usually attains — require more effort from a listener than much else. But these difficulties are never superfluous, nor does Stevens ever insert a quirk for its own sake. Rather, one gets the sense while listening that this is his natural idiom, that the unexpected truths he seeks to illuminate here could not have been expressed another way. This is certainly Stevens’ best album yet, and in a year already filled with excellent releases, it ranks among the greatest.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, most people don’t know the next time they’ll be able to attend a live concert. Six months into this drought of live music, the chameleonic Gabriel Garzón-Montano has crafted the perfect antidote for lovers of ambitious Latin music. His sophomore album “Agüita,” out October 2nd, is a sharp work, twisting into his already well-defined sound: sparse, jazz-inspired Latin tracks. This new project reveals an overwhelming tenderness, elevating it from his previous albums. It carries listeners from the confines of their own spaces to a hypnotic dance floor, through a plethora of rule-bending blends that prick at the mind’s sense of security as much as the body’s. Be warned: Garzón-Montano’s album revels in extremes, leaving no listener untouched.
Most famous for a Drake sample on 2016’s “Jungle,” Garzón-Montano’s career took off quickly: He released his debut EP in 2014 and opened for Lenny Kravitz the same year, before producing an incredibly well-received first album, “Jardín,” in 2017. Born in Brooklyn to a French mother and Colombian father, he grew up immersed in the sounds of the Philip Glass Ensemble. He grew a sensibility for precise production and is a talented multi-instrumentalist, playing guitar, bass, piano, and drums. Now, years after that first brush with fame, Montano has a new manifesto: that old sound? He’s moved on. In an interview with Uproxx, he cites that the music industry forces him to ask, “I’m supposed to sing about what matters to heart, but at your convenience? Do you feel safe enough to listen to my emotions?” “Agüita” ensures listeners have a harder time doing so.
The album is structured through a merry-go-round of three intertwined characters: the “impressionist,” the Latin trap star, and a third undescribed one. For his Latin hip-hop work, “Muñeca” and “Mira My Look” (“look like I made you, mom like I made you, feed you and bathe you”) alter modern reggaeton and sly, Gambino-esque hip-hop. When they appear on the album, they punctuate and relieve the emotionally heavy surroundings, if also providing the album’s only awkwardness. Garzón-Montano’s other eight songs are less easily categorizable; some are his tried-and-true experimental sound, while others extend into spacey ambience to dramatize moments of crisis in romantic and familial relationships.
On the opener, “Tombs,” creepy, dissonant vocals blur into a symphonic interrogation of death: “Why discuss what we can’t see? Why awaken from a gorgeous dream?” As with the rest of the album, chromaticism abounds, and this track builds to a climax of electric guitars with a flash of intensity comparable to Yves Tumor. Midway through the album, “Fields” situates the listener in Garzón-Montano’s breathy voice as it almost stretches to its limit over tense horns. The album’s centerpiece, “Moonless,” crystallizes the album’s designing principle: His lyrics mourn his mother over a deceptively upbeat, euphoric instrumental. Juxtaposing his experimental sound with strings that evoke his mother’s classical training, a surprising truth emerges. Music is attuned to mourning because it mobilizes the sounds which form our hearts, and attempts to capture those who have moved us the most.
Given the Black roots of reggaeton and Latin trap styles which Garzón-Montano plays with in this album, it’s worth asking what power he has in using it. He’s not an A-lister, like chart-toppers Bad Bunny and J Balvin, but he still is influential within the experimental music landscape. The song “Agüita,” was inspired, he says, by his experiments on Tierra Whack’s “Fruit Salad,” with some production techniques from Migos. In extending beyond his previous sound, the dilemma emerges: When these are Black-created genres, how far can a non-Black artist go? In June, he released a statement after silence on the Black Lives Matter uprisings in the U.S., vowing to “value all black lives as much as I do black culture.” His veracity is still a little shaky, but if there’s anything he proves, it’s that music carries through cultures, and one can draw elements from many into a cohesive final product.
“Agüita”’s title track (featuring one of the most electric videos of the year, floating from the expansive jungle to the streets of Colombia) comes right before the album’s closer. Bass emerges, autotune whines, a trap beat rattles, and listeners are launched into what, as a single, sounds like a typical Latin hip-hop song. But after the album has lulled listeners into a meditative state, “Agüita” is a jolt of energy. It’s destabilizing, almost scary — inviting audiences to flock to the street and throw their bodies into dance. By the sweeping final track “Blue Dot,” static cracks suggest the album itself is breaking open: a natural ending to a riveting trip through the mind, fading out over wordless final minutes. Only then can the album get under the skin, as it was meant to be known.
