After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In her exhilarating debut novel “The Girl with the Louding Voice,” Abi Daré details the life of an optimistic, if naive, girl from a small village in Nigeria. Adunni wants to finish school but, in the wake of her mother’s death, her father marries her off to a rich man with two other wives in order to collect her bride-price. Thus ensues a fast-paced adventure novel that oscillates between uplifting and heartbreaking. The novel’s only real shortcomings are its semi-predictable plot and a bit too much didaticism.
Perhaps one of the strongest parts of the novel is Adunni’s narrative voice, no pun intended. Written in the patois of Adunni’s village, the book is inundated with insightful and colorful descriptions of Nigeria. Most salient are Adunni’s accounts of the upper class of Lagos, which she encounters after running away from her abusive husband. Adunni’s vibrant metaphors highlight some of the more ridiculous practices of the extremely wealthy: “Big Madam’s face is full of all sorts of makeups, be like she melt a rainbow, wipe it on her face.” The depictions are often humorous and bring a bit of light in moments that are otherwise stressful, even dangerous, for Adunni.
Daré does an excellent job capturing the class and gender struggles present in Nigeria. Adunni is often left demoralized by the powerful men in her life: Her father trades her away for money, her husband assaults her, and the husband in the house she works at is an ever-threatening presence. Yet even the women are not always there to help and class ties often override everything else. The rich friends of Big Madam, Adunni’s employer in Lagos, scoff at the notion that something bad happened to Big Madam’s previous housemaid: “They all run away in the end, don’t they?” They poke fun at Adunni and rudely order her around. Big Madam beats Adunni for the slightest transgressions, just as Big Madam’s husband beats her.
The book is almost impossible to put down for many reasons. The prose, while written in Adunni’s patois, is easy to read, the chapters are short, and the novel itself is packed with action. Adunni is constantly in unsafe environments and each chapter brings suspense: Will she be safe? Can she escape her life of servitude? Despite her perilous situation, Adunni is a hopeful and easy-to-love character. It’s difficult not to become enraptured by her easygoing nature and her determination to learn, which only makes the reader all the more invested in her safety.
Though the book is suspenseful, the plot usually turns out to be exactly what one might predict. The characters Adunni comes into contact with — the rude husband, the kindly cook, the nasty rich women, the one rich woman who sees Adunni’s shining light — begin to feel a bit archetypal. Their characterization makes it all the easier to foresee what is to come. It gives the novel a mythic or fable-like quality, making it feel less like the story of one girl and more like a lesson nicely packaged within a novel. The didacticism — all girls deserve to go to school, no one deserves to be treated so terribly — is particularly heavy-handed considering that most would agree with its general premise.
But in the end “The Girl with the Louding Voice” is an uplifting story. What begins as demoralizing (“Use her till she is useless!” her father tells her husband at Adunni’s wedding) ends as a hopeful look at what hard work and kindness can achieve even in the darkest circumstances.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“That’s some real white people shit. They ain’t even black.”
How many times have you heard something like that? I have become so deeply accustomed to it. I hate it. I have heard it in South Africa. I have heard it here in America. I have heard it from my own mouth — indeed, I am guilty too. You know where I haven’t heard it from much? White people. This is black people limiting black people, and I can’t comprehend why we do it. There are as many ways to be black as there are black people. And I really don’t think I can say that enough.
“You’re black and you listen to THIS music? Wow.” But who gave anyone the power to define what it means to be black? The black musical tradition is certainly rich. There’s enough jazz, rap, hip-hop, and R&B to fill your ears and soul for many lifetimes. But if a black person wants to slap on some country, who are you or I to tell them that we no longer share an identity because of it? I don’t care if you, or even most of us, don’t like the music. I don’t care if a genre has even explicitly excluded black people from itself. We still don’t get to make that statement, and let me tell you why ...
There are as many ways to be black as there are black people.
“You’re black and you can’t even speak your language? Mxm.” But who gave anyone the power to define what it means to be black? Yes, South Africa has many languages to choose from. I miss them all, some days out here I really wish I couldn’t understand everyone’s conversation. But simply because someone has dark skin and never learned their native language does not entitle us to strip them of their heritage. I don’t care if it signals a lack of respect. I don’t care if you feel like that person is trying to distance themselves from their culture. We have no right to do that, and I will tell you why ...
There are as many ways to be black as there are black people.
“A black Republican? That sounds like an oxymoron.” But who gave anyone the power to define what it means to be black? Granted, the vast majority of black Americans are not Republicans. I am definitely a part of the roughly 84 percent of us who aren’t right now. But who gave the 84 percent of us the power to deny the identity of the rest. I don’t care if the policies that they support may hurt us or themselves. I don’t care if they are being used as tools by other politicians to justify their racism at times. We still don’t get to make that statement, and I. Will. Tell. You. Why.
THERE ARE AS MANY WAYS TO BE BLACK AS THERE ARE BLACK PEOPLE.
“How are you gonna be black and have hair like ... that?” But who gave anyone the power to define what it means to be black?! If it is natural and curly, someone will think your hair looks “nappy.” If it is not natural and straight, someone will think that you don’t love yourself. Heck, if it is naturally straight, you know someone is still going to persecute you. If it is uncombed, someone will think you look like a “savage.” If it is combed, someone will still think that you don’t love the way God made you. Lord knows that as a man I cannot even begin to process what it is like for black women, but I know that there is no such thing as pleasing everyone. And that is just hair. I don’t even have to bring in the light-skinned, dark-skinned dynamic or the mixed, non-mixed angle for you to get my point which is that: I don’t care what you think; no facet of appearance gives any of us the right to strip the identity of anyone else. And do I still even need to tell you why?
…
I understand the apprehension around expanding what it means to be black. I get that if we expand what we consider black, we expand that to some things or people that we may not want to consider part of the same group as ourselves. But that is not a choice we get to make. We don’t get to limit or take away identity. Haven’t we all felt enough of what being stripped of an identity can do to a person? I certainly think we have.
So who am I to define what being black is? No one. So I won’t. And who are you? No one. But I can no longer tolerate the limiting of that definition by any individual. There are as many ways to be black as there are black people.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It comes as no big surprise to many students at Harvard University that the administration has come under increased scrutiny by the United States Department of Education for a lack of transparency with regards to funding, or now, two leading advisory board members have resigned from the Institute of Politics amid tensions within the Harvard Kennedy School. After just one semester at Harvard, I’ve witnessed a student union strike for fair work conditions such as pay equity, health insurance, and better protections against harassment and discrimination, and protests calling for Harvard’s leadership in divesting from fossil fuel investments for climate justice. To add to this list of moral grievances, the Kennedy School is undermining a pivotal component of the Mid-Career Masters in Public Administration program, exclusively targeting students from developing countries — almost half the entire cohort.
At stake is an integral part of the MC/MPA program, the Mason Fellows Summer Seminar. The Edward S. Mason Program, designed for students from developing countries, is a big deal; it boasts a prime minister, presidents, and leaders of multilateral institutions among its alumni. It’s the program that brought me to the Kennedy School.
The two-week Mason Fellows Seminar has been hosted upon the fellows’ arrival at Harvard and orients us before a subsequent five-week MC/MPA Summer Program, which includes the larger MC/MPA cohort, including students from developed countries. Quietly, however, the HKS Five-Year Academic Calendar has been updated — no longer showing the Mason Fellows Seminar in Summer 2020. Instead, the Seminar appears to have been swapped to a mere week-long “Fall Launch,” and relegated, like an afterthought, to the end of the summer. This is not what’s best for the integrity and excellence of Harvard's MC/MPA program.
The Mason Fellows Seminar is an incredibly valued period allowing students coming from some societies, where there is no freedom of speech nor right to assemble, an opportunity to find their voice. Mason Fellows can come from autocratic regimes, places where electricity and drinking water are not available 24 hours a day, and in some cases, places where having certain sexual orientations is a crime punishable by death. The opportunity for fellows to come together before the academic year begins is invaluable for both their experience and the campus community to which they contribute.
My Mason summer experience helped me cultivate relationships, exposed me to different backgrounds and experiences, and introduced me to public policy issues from leading Harvard professors. By contrast, the twice-as-long, cohort-wide MC/MPA Summer Program that followed was banal with the majority of the time spent on introductory subjects in economics and statistics, much of which could have been delivered through HarvardX, the open online learning platform. In fact, one could argue using HarvardX would allow more of the Mason Program pedagogy and benefits to be integrated into MC/MPA summer program.
In the same week that the Kennedy School announced it was searching for ways to “make progress in the areas of diversity, inclusion and belonging,” administrators signaled no interest in changing their course on the MC/MPA summer program changes. This was despite a meeting MC/MPA student leaders held with administrators, including Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf, to initiate a process of engagement to best inform how all MC/MPA summer programming could be improved. The irony that, at a time when the Kennedy School searches for ways to make progress in belonging, inclusion, and diversity on campus, an exemplary program specifically designed to foster these values — not to mention paid for by Mason fellows themselves — has been gutted, is not lost on me. Actions taken by the Kennedy School suggest what we’re hearing is just empty rhetoric. The proposed changes in MC/MPA summer programming are actually a step backward for diversity and inclusion and demonstrate Harvard’s inability to navigate diversity settings effectively.
Such apathetic decisions towards the Mason Program which values diversity and inclusion are not those of the Harvard I had envisioned when I was writing my application. I envisaged a scholastic year under the tutelage of leading thinkers and subject matter experts in the international development and public policy space. I envisaged myself learning new and innovative methods to analyze and propose solutions for today’s issues. I envisaged a cadre of fellow students with a strong desire to learn and who come from varied backgrounds and experiences. I did not envisage being enrolled in a scholastic enterprise that only professes the merits of transparency and open data, participatory and inclusive processes to manage change, and using information and knowledge to inform decisions, while not actually practicing them.
My time at Harvard will come to an end in May, and without action to reverse course by the Kennedy School Administration, this will be the last MC/MPA class benefiting from a Mason cohort to benefit from the two-week induction period. Established some 60 years ago, the Mason Fellowship sought to bring developing country leaders to Harvard to “address the world’s most compelling development challenges.” Halving the introductory seminar undermines that goal. Perhaps in some areas Harvard can walk-the-walk, but when it comes to issues like equity, diversity, transparency, and informed, inclusive decision-making you should only do as Harvard teaches, not as it practices.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two years have passed since Harvard College Faith and Action was put on administrative probation after its leadership was found to have pressured a bisexual assistant Bible course leader to resign after discovering her same-sex relationship. Soon after, the College stated that HCFA would have to sever its ties from its parent group Christian Union in order to regain its status as a recognized social organization on campus.
As it turns out, HCFA did not sever such ties. It was recently reported that HCFA continues to receive Christian Union funding in the form of staff salaries, office space, food, and scholarships for retreats. It was also reported that Christian Union gave the student group $796,180 between July 2017 and June 2018 while its year-long probation period was still underway.
This isn’t a new problem. A year ago we strongly criticized how the College’s poor enforcement of HCFA’s probation. It appears that not much — read: nothing — has changed since then. The fact that HCFA has still not severed its ties to Christian Union underscores the broadly felt impotence of the Dean of Students Office as an enforcing body.
We reaffirm our judgment that HCFA was wrong to discriminate against its membership on the basis of sexual orientation and that they should accordingly face the stated punishment. But it’s the College’s, and in particular the DSO’s, job to enforce these sanctions. At the point where HCFA has carried on without issue for two years, it’s hard to see such a lack of punishment as anything but Harvard’s fault.
As we have written before, it is ludicrous to believe that the sanctions against unrecognized single-gender social group members — spread out across all of the many recognized organizations on campus — would be enforced effectively (or at all) given how the probation of HCFA has been conducted by the DSO. In order to gain necessary credibility, the College must hold itself accountable for its incompetence in enforcing its probations and ensure that any violation of rules meets its stated consequences.
The College’s failure to enforce its probation of HCFA is likely connected to a statement made by Roland S. Davis, who then served as Associate Dean of Students for Diversity and Inclusion, that the College is hesitant to punish HCFA because it does not want to be seen as waging war on Christianity. While we recognize that Harvard does not want to be seen as an enemy of religion on campus, the College must apply its rules evenly and fairly, and we maintain that the freedom of one group on campus cannot come at the expense of another’s.
That being said, we value and appreciate religious groups having space on campus, and it is important that the College supports their presence. This support, however, cannot get in the way of the College’s ability to enforce prohibitions on religious groups that breach student organization policy.
HCFA should face the punishment it was given despite the time that has passed since its demonstrated discrimination and policy breach. To make that happen and to prevent future cases like this, Harvard should take full responsibility for failing to enforce its measures against HCFA, as well as social groups on campus, and it should move to improve the efficacy and transparency of implementing such punitive measures in the future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: 12:39 p.m.
Hundreds of supporters lined the streets outside of U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren’s (D-Mass.) house in Cambridge Tuesday morning to greet her as she walked to her polling location at the Graham and Parks School.
Warren — a former Harvard Law School professor — hugged and took selfies with supporters as her onlookers chanted “I believe that she can win” while she inched her way down the street with her husband, Law School Professor Bruce H. Mann.
“It’s just a typical Election Day in Cambridge!” Warren joked to supporters after voting.
Warren was delivered a stinging third-place finish in Tuesday’s state primary by Massachusetts voters. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. pulled off a surprise victory in the state and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) finished in second.
Asked by a reporter after her speech whether she was worried about Sanders winning her home state, Warren said she is unfazed by her competition, instead turning toward her time teaching at the Law School.
“I’m not worried,” she said. “I am happy to be part of this democratic process. You know, ten years ago, I was walking here to vote — I was a teacher. I was not any part of this electoral process, other than as a voter.”
Dozens of Harvard students attended Tuesday’s event to rally for Warren. Justin Y. Tseng ’22 said he is “realistic” about Warren’s standing in the race, but added he is still excited about her candidacy.
“She’s the candidate who I trust the most in the White House,” Tseng said.
Attendee Peter L. Laskin ’23 said he was also skeptical of Warren’s ability to make a serious run at the Democratic nomination, but said he preferred her to the other candidates nevertheless.
“I think Biden has more of a lock on the moderate vote and I think Sanders has more of a lock on the progressive vote,” Laskin added. “I think she’s sort of splitting the difference, but it’s not going to be a recipe for success."
“Do I think she will be the nominee? Probably not, but I like her better than any of the others,” he said.
Biden’s campaign has been bolstered in recent days by three high-profile endorsements from ex-rivals. Former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Peter P. M. Buttigieg ’04, U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), and former U.S. Representative Beto O’Rourke have all thrown their support behind Biden as he tries to match Sanders.
“I think that that’s what their politics were all along,” Warren said of the endorsements. “I don’t think there’s anything surprising here, but I do believe the Democratic Party is a progressive party.”
Sarah Katz, a Boston resident who volunteered for Warren’s campaign in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, said it was “insane” to meet her for the first time on Tuesday.
“It was incredible,” she said. “She’s making time for all of us, even though she’s clearly very tired.”
Mann — Warren’s husband of 38 years who walked to vote with her Tuesday alongside their dog, Bailey — said the turnout for Tuesday’s event was “very humbling.”
“We’ve been married a long time and it’s always been an adventure,” he said. “The adventures just keep getting bigger and better.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard administrators advised professors to prepare contingency plans for teaching and research in response to the continued spread of the novel coronavirus at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ monthly meeting Tuesday.
Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay both addressed the virus at the meeting.
Nguyen said HUHS is working with administrators, health authorities, and experts across Harvard’s schools to prepare the University for a potential outbreak. He added that the current situation is “very fluid” and asked faculty to plan for unexpected changes.
Gay asked faculty members to plan solutions to allow teaching and research to continue with minimal interruptions. She suggested that faculty learn to teach using Zoom, a video communication platform.
Harvard restricted all University-related travel to China in early February after the first case of coronavirus in Boston was reported. Later, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued Level 3 travel warnings for COVID-19 in South Korea, Italy, and Iran, prompting Harvard to add the three countries to its restricted travel list.
Later in the meeting, the faculty also discussed a motion to simplify rules for simultaneous course enrollment.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh submitted the motion on behalf of the Standing Committee on Undergraduate Educational Policy following the committee’s review of simultaneous enrollment policies.
Currently, FAS allows simultaneous enrollment in one of three circumstances: when one of the course heads agrees to provide “hour-for-hour direct and personal compensatory instruction” for missed class time; when lectures are available on videotape, and a student will miss no more than one-third of them; or when a senior needs both courses to fulfill graduation requirements. Under all three circumstances, students must submit a petition to the Administrative Board to enroll.
Claybaugh said sorting through the hundreds of petitions submitted each semester takes around “300 hours of labor,” causing delays that can prove “stressful” for students.
Under the proposed revision, the Standing Committee will grant waivers to courses that meet certain criteria, allowing students to simultaneously enroll in them without petitioning. In other cases, students still must receive permission from the heads of both courses and petition the Ad Board.
Claybaugh said current procedures do not make sense for courses that upload online lectures and provide other opportunities for in-person instruction.
“I hope these changes will empower faculty to try new, creative teaching methods,” Computer Science professor Stuart M. Shieber, who presented the proposal, said.
Some courses have already been granted waivers from normal simultaneous enrollment rules.
FAS has exempted Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science” from simultaneous enrollment rules since 2014, while Economics 10: “Principles of Economics” and Statistics 110: “Introduction to Probability” received similar exemptions in 2019.
Also during the meeting, Philosophy chair Edward J. Hall requested an update from University President Lawrence S. Bacow on the Harvard Corporation’s response to fossil fuel divestment. During its February meeting, the faculty voted 179-20 to call on the Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — to divest.
“We anticipate that the Corporation, however it responds — we hope positively, given the clarity of the community-wide call for leadership — does so in such a way as to make its reasoning public,” Hall said.
Bacow responded that the Corporation is “aware” of the resolution, but did not have time to substantively consider it in its last meeting, which happened just after the February faculty meeting.
“In the same way it took more than one meeting for this group to discuss the issues, it’s likely to take more than one month for the Corporation to respond as well,” Bacow said.
Bacow pledged to report back to the faculty before the semester’s end.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following reports of racism, sexism, and alleged favoritism within Harvard University Police Department, University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in an interview Monday that he supports the review of the department by outside experts.
The allegations, reported by The Crimson in late January, centered around longtime department chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley. In Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination filings, lawsuits, internal documents, meetings with prominent Harvard administrators, and interviews, 21 current and former employees identified Riley as the source of instances of racism and sexism in the department.
Riley, according to employees, favored employees loyal to him and retaliated against those who had voiced concerns about the department.
In the wake of The Crimson’s investigation, Riley announced in a February 5 email to HUPD employees that he will lead an internal review of the department. This review marks the fourth formal assessment of HUPD during Riley’s tenure.
As part of the review, law enforcement experts will examine the internal climate of Harvard’s police department as well as its dealings with the University more broadly.
Bacow said Monday that the department is “committed” to the internal review process and affirmed the inclusion of outside experts in the review.
“It has brought in some outside experts to do a review, and I think it's a good move on the part of the department,” Bacow said. “We're looking forward to seeing what the review produces.”
After the findings of the Crimson investigation became public, student activists called for the resignation of Riley and the abolition of the University’s police department at a rally in Harvard Yard. The protesters demanded an end to the alleged harassment they said they have experienced by Harvard police officers.
When asked about current and former HUPD employees’ lawsuits and filings with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, Bacow said he believes the filings occurred before his tenure.
“I believe most of those filings, or maybe all of them, occurred well before I became president,” Bacow said. “I haven't seen anything that's been filed recently — or any decisions recently.”
Bacow deferred further questions about the internal review to Executive Vice President Katherine Lapp, who oversees HUPD.
“Katie has a tremendous amount of experience in public safety based upon her experience previously in NYC city government, where the Police and the Fire Department reported to her, and Katie is deeply involved in these issues,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of Global Alliance for Medical Innovation, a student-run organization, are working to develop a mobile application for symptom reporting to Harvard University Health Services in collaboration with Organismic and Evolutionary Biology professor Pardis C. Sabeti.
The application, called HouseCall, would allow students to report symptoms remotely and receive consultation and treatment in their rooms, rather than going to HUHS. The developers hope this will minimize the spread of infectious diseases on campus.
The application was inspired by recent discoveries by Sabeti’s lab group regarding the 2016-2017 mumps outbreak on Harvard’s campus. With over 60 confirmed cases, the outbreak served as a reminder of the many spots on campus vulnerable to the spread of infectious diseases, including the HUHS waiting room, Sabeti said.
Global Alliance for Medical Innovation founder Sreekar Mantena ’22 said the goal of the application is to minimize spread of infectious diseases, such as mumps, influenza, and coronavirus.
“Coronavirus, as a respiratory pathogen, is passed on by droplet-based transmission, so being able to limit such an infectious disease pathogen would be really powerful in improving our ability for public health response,” Mantena said.
“With infectious diseases, obviously, once you leave the room you’re in contact with a bunch of peers, students, HUHS members, faculty and that leads to a lot of spread on campus,” he added.
HouseCall would give students a way to report illnesses and receive care, all from the comfort of their bed. After reporting symptoms, a member of HUHS or someone in the House system would receive the report and go to the student’s room to perform a rapid diagnostic test and provide the necessary treatment for the diagnosed illness, Mantena said.
Sabeti said this reporting process would not diminish the amount of information health care practitioners get from a patient.
“Instead of going to the pharmacy to get your medicine, why don’t we bring it to you? And when we bring it to you, why don’t we get more information about your symptoms?” Sabeti said.
Mantena said the group hopes to have the app ready for rollout in three to four weeks.
While the short-term goal is to implement the app in the the Houses, the group hopes to eventually take the framework of HouseCall to other parts of the world, such as West Africa.
“When someone feels sick, they can report their symptoms and then a community health worker could come to their house to do a rapid diagnostic test and ensure everything’s okay, give treatment, and especially on a larger scale like on a country scale, being able to track specific cases with geospatial and also diagnostic test data would be really powerful,” Mantena said.
Mantena said the group hopes the implementation of HouseCall on Harvard’s campus can serve as a test run for such broader implementation.
“Being able to do a field trial of a system like this at Harvard would be really credible because we have a really great, controlled environment to work in,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students at the Harvard Kennedy School criticized their dean’s response to an open letter sent by the HKS Equity Coalition earlier this month advocating for a commitment from the school to “creating a culture and environment built on the principles of anti-racism.”
The original letter sent by the coalition contains three demands: a mandatory course on the history of race and inequality, mandatory diversity training for all Kennedy School affiliates, and cluster hiring of faculty of color who “critically study the intersectionality of race, gender, class, and power.”
The letter was signed by multiple affinity groups and 375 Kennedy School affiliates.
In an emailed response to members of the equity coalition, Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf wrote the school is working with the advocacy group Community Change, Inc. to develop anti-racism workshops this spring. If the process is successful, these workshops will be implemented during new student orientation in the fall, according to Elmendorf’s email.
He wrote that although he and his colleagues are “committed” to adding more courses on race and inequality, they are not yet “convinced” that a “mandatory, standalone course is the best approach.” He also wrote that the school has been working on faculty cluster hiring focused on the stated topics for “several years.”
Several students criticized Elmendorf’s response to the coalition letter in interviews with The Crimson. Elmendorf did not respond to a request for comment on any of the criticisms.
Nneka O. Onwuzurike, one of the original authors of the coalition letter, called the dean’s response to the three demands “lackluster.” She cited the absence of student involvement in creating the anti-racism workshops.
“We are not involved in the process of creating solutions to the problems that we, ourselves, have identified to the organization,” she said.
Mike Yepes, a first year at Kennedy School, said he feels Elmendorf misinterpreted what the students meant by a mandatory course focusing on the history of race and inequality.
“We requested a class that catered to talking about oppression and systemic violence across a global context,” Yepes said.
The course did not address this topic, according to Yepes.
In response to Elmendorf’s comment on the process of attracting faculty, Abhinaya Narayanan — another author of the original coalition letter — said while she “recognizes that’s a challenge,” she believes the administration needs to do more to promote an inclusive culture.
“If the administration is taking steps to make sure that there are courses in place, that they are recruiting students of color here — we need to make sure that the environment here is one that faculty of color can come to and thrive,” she said.
This has not historically been the case, according to Narayanan.
Sophie P. Dover said the culture at the Kennedy School contributes to its difficulty in attracting faculty.
“What does it say to an applicant when we only have — formerly one, now two — black individuals on tenured faculty? What does it mean or signal to applicants when there is no focus on racist structures within the public policy realm, or the role of colonialism in international affairs?” Dover asked.
“That's sending clear signaling and messaging to excellent potential faculty who are of Harvard caliber and are going to other schools that are our competitors,” she said.
Onwuzurike cited a simulation that took place in the fall as an example of why she believes the school needs workshops and faculty of color who focus on issues related to diversity and inequality. Dubbed the "Bell Harbor" simulation, the exercise was run by white moderators and required first year Masters in Public Policy students to assume roles in a case about police brutality, according to Onwuzurike and three other students interviewed.
“These white teachers and TAs wrote out a fictionalization of a black man being murdered by the police,” Onwuzurike said.
Onwuzurike was given the role of a “white PhD student who had a lot of racist ideologies in her language,” which made her uncomfortable.
The simulation led several students of color to leave the class, according to Yepes.
“Immediately — like within 10 seconds of reading the prompt — several students of color walked out,” he said. “Multiple others were very uncomfortable and just none of us can fathom how this managed to make it through rounds of reviews to faculty to be given as an assignment for 250 students.”
Course instructors held a “check-in” about the simulation afterwards, according to Yepes.
Elmendorf did not respond to a request for comment on the situation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a paucity of available affordable housing continues to plague the Cambridge area, the city government’s Housing Committee gathered Tuesday to assess the current outlook and discuss looming challenges.
City housing officials and representatives from local housing corporations outlined steps they have taken to increase investment in Cambridge, pledging more development in the near future.
City Councilor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler said the city has a “responsibility” to provide affordable housing, citing its dynamic economy.
“Cambridge has a lot of resources, and I think with a lot of resources comes a lot of responsibility,” he said. “Cambridge is a city known for innovation, and I think we also can apply that to housing.”
Members of the housing committee include multiple city councilors, as well as representatives from the city’s housing authority and affordable housing organizations.
Carl Nagy-Koechlin, executive director of Just-A-Start, a local development corporation, said that his organization has attempted to serve the “people side of housing.”
“No matter how many apartments we develop, it’s really only going to serve a fraction of the needs,” he said. “So we also provide a number of housing services: court mediation to prevent evictions, rapid rehousing for families that have been evicted.”
For decades, Cambridge has grappled with the effects of gentrification, including ballooning housing costs. From 2005-2014, for instance, Cambridge experienced the largest increase — 79.8 percent — in median single-family home prices in all of Massachusetts, according to the Warren Group, which compiles real estate and financial data.
Christopher Cotter, housing director for the Affordable Trust Fund, said that the Trust Fund is currently looking at new sites and will have more projects to announce in the coming months.
“We are talking with developers about moving into the permitting phase of their development timeframe,” he said.
Despite the promises proffered by housing organizations at the meeting, the reception from local residents did not appear universally positive. Valerie A. Bonds, a longtime Cambridge denizen, said she was disheartened by the lack of representation of tenants living in affordable housing at Tuesday’s gathering.
“I’m disappointed that there weren’t more representation from the tenant councils, tenant associations, and tenant committees of members who live in affordable housing, whose leadership should be here to speak for us,” she said.
Bonds said she would like to see a representative from those that oversee her building to be present at the tenant council meetings.
“I’d like to see more interaction between owners and management involving attending monthly meetings of the resident community organizations,” she said. “I think that would make the biggest difference for me.”
Michael J. Johnston, executive director of the Cambridge Housing Authority, said that his agency has worked to move its portfolio out of public housing and into a Section Eight “project-based portfolio,” referring to the government program that provides housing subsidies to low-income individuals. In the past decade, he said his agency has conducted approximately $500 million worth of renovations, building, and other work in Cambridge.
“A new world means we have investors,” he said. “We’ve had investors come in and provide us money to basically do the work.”
“For our residents, that means new kitchens and baths, new plumbing in the walls, new windows,” he added.
Bonds, though, said that she is disappointed that what she called necessary renovations have not occurred despite recent rent increases. The renovations that have occurred, she contended, are minor.
“I believe that some of those renovations are cosmetic, and that the serious improvements that need to be done, in my opinion, are not being taken care of,” she said. “These repairs, it seems, are repairing repairs.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School students allege administrators have been insufficiently transparent regarding the development of its new Religious Freedom Clinic, expressing concerns about its potential to enable BGLTQ discrimination.
The Law School announced plans to open the clinic on Feb. 26. At the time, administrators said they plan to model it after the Religious Liberty Clinic at Stanford Law School, offering students the opportunity to represent clients who face limits on the free exercise of their religion.
Harvard Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 first discussed the idea of the clinic with students at a Law School Curriculum Committee open house in Oct. 2019. Law School students and Lambda Co-Presidents Youzhihang Deng and Matthew P. Shields and Campus Advocacy Co-Chair Mia Gettenberg said the school did not consult students before that open house.
“As it turned out, HLS had decided to form this clinic primarily in the dark, with no formal process to solicit input from the broader student body or a coalition of student groups,” Deng, Shields, and Gettenberg wrote in a letter to the editor of the Harvard Law Record on Monday.
Students from Lambda — an organization dedicated to serving BGLTQ students on campus — asked Manning at the October open house whether the clinic would avoid cases that abridge the rights of BGTLQ individuals. The Monday letter to the Harvard Law Record claimed that, at the time, Manning did not provide a clear answer to that question.
“Citing the principle of academic freedom, Dean Manning refused to directly respond to the question,” they wrote in the letter to the editor.
The Law School’s student government passed a resolution unanimously on Nov. 20 calling for increased transparency from Manning regarding the clinic’s scope and whether it would commit to nondiscrimination. The resolution noted the clinic may conduct “important and meaningful work” in support of religious minorities, adding that the Law School should take care to prevent violations of its nondiscrimination policy.
“We believe that if, on the other hand, this clinic takes on cases that impinge on the rights of the LGBTQIA+ community, it would significantly alienate such identifying students of our student body, deter talented individuals from considering Harvard Law, and be a smear on the Harvard Law name nationwide,” the resolution reads.
Also on Nov. 21, Lambda submitted a letter to Manning and the Curriculum Committee in November expressing concerns about the proposed clinic. The letter, co-signed by 25 other Law School student organizations, asked whether the clinic would work in support of conversion therapy or against abortion clinics. Students also asked for additional information about the funding and leadership of the clinic.
“Without the guarantee that such a Religious Freedom Clinic would not provide legal services in support of anti-LGBTQ+ and anti-reproductive justice causes, we do not understand how such a clinic could be housed at HLS,” the letter reads. “We are also concerned by the lack of transparency and student engagement surrounding the development of the Religious Freedom Clinic.”
According to Shields, Lambda never received a response from Manning about the letter. Instead, other deans at the Law School reached out to the students to discuss the clinic.
“They were very, very great, but they did not know anything about the clinic, and it just was a conversation of them saying, ‘we don't know that’ or ‘we don't know whether we can tell you that,’” Shields said in an interview Monday.
Shields noted Lambda sent a follow-up email asking to meet with Manning, an invitation they said he declined.
On Feb. 26 — the same day the Law School formally announced plans for the clinic — Lambda hosted a public rally and hand-delivered signs protesting the clinic to Manning’s office.
Law School spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an emailed statement that Manning has engaged with Lambda students about their concerns, both at the Curriculum Committee open house and in emails with Lambda leadership. He also referenced the Law School’s invitations for Lambda students to meet with various other deans, including Vice Dean for Experiential and Clinical Education Daniel Nagin and Assistant Dean for Clinical and Pro Bono Program Lisa P. Dealy.
“In keeping with the core principles of clinical education at HLS, the new Religious Freedom Clinic will represent underserved and vulnerable clients,” Neal wrote. “It will be designed to be pluralistic and inclusive, and to attract students from across political, ideological, and philosophical perspectives.”
In response to concerns about the clinic’s potential work for discriminatory organizations, Neal wrote that the curriculum would not be at the discretion of the administration.
“The dean does not dictate the case selection of any of the School’s clinical professors or it’s 46 legal clinics and student practice organizations,” he wrote.
The Law School branch of the American Civil Liberties Union — which co-signed the November letter to Manning — reaffirmed its support for Lambda in an emailed statement Tuesday.
“We are troubled by Dean Manning’s refusal to ensure that the clinic will not undermine the rights of the LGBTQ+ community,” Law School student Sara R. Fitzpatrick wrote on behalf of the Harvard Law ACLU. “Religious freedom is a fundamental American right, and it should not be used as a pretext for discriminatory and harmful practices.”
“We are proud to stand with our friends at Lambda to demand that Harvard commit to a clinic that will work for, and not against, civil rights,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Physicist and environmental activist Vandana Shiva cautioned against globalization and industrial agriculture while delivering the Harvard Graduate School of Design’s annual International Womxn's Day keynote lecture Tuesday evening.
The talk featured an introduction by the co-chairs of the Design School's Womxn in Design group followed by Shiva’s lecture, which was focused on her environmental activism and advocacy.
“If the whole world farmed through biodiversity, if the whole world farmed organically, we could actually reverse climate change, and we'd have good food and we'd have livelihoods and we'd have peaceful societies,” Shiva said during the talk.
The talk was part of an annual series of International Womxn’s Week events hosted by Womxn in Design. This year’s series is focused on the theme of kinship between humanity and the environment, according to Vaissnavi Shukl, a co-chair of the group.
“It’s just a week of celebration,” Shukl said. “This time we are focusing on kinship and not just limiting kinship to relationships between humans but also relationships between women and the environment, women and soil, women and seeds, and to kind of humanity and other species.”
In her lecture, Shiva encouraged audience members to “celebrate the earth.”
“It's time to put away the arrogance that some humans are above other humans and that those other humans are superior to other species,” she said. “That’s anthropocentrism. Let's say bye bye to racism, to sexism, to anthropocentrism, and celebrate the earth.”
Shiva’s talk comes in light of recent controversy after she delivered a different environmental lecture at Stanford on January 23. A letter published in European Scientist condemned Stanford’s decision to invite Shiva because of her use of “anti-scientific rhetoric to support unethical positions.”
An op-ed written by Students for a Sustainable Stanford and published in The Stanford Daily shortly after Shiva’s Stanford talk defended the decision to invite her to speak. The letter cited Shiva’s global recognition and Students for a Sustainable Stanford’s mission to represent people of color and marginalized groups.
Womxn in Design wrote in an emailed statement that it invited Shiva to elevate a dialogue about “relationship between womxn and nature, and between the patriarchy and environmental degradation.” While organizers are aware of the controversy surrounding Shiva’s invitation to Stanford, they wrote that her invitation was met with “nothing but support and excitement from our own community at the GSD.”
“This discourse is grossly under-explored at the GSD—but critical in light of womxn's historical under-representation and marginalization in/through the design fields,” Womxn in Design's statement reads.
“We are grateful to have had a full auditorium tonight and appreciate the willingness of our community to engage in open discussion,” it continues.
Some attendees of the Harvard talk, however, said they were skeptical of Shiva's remarks.
“What worries me about her position is that it, and I understand for ideological and political objectives, just over simplifies the situation,” Design School student Nicolas Delgado Alcega said. “It tries to sparse out a climate of, like, who's good and who's bad — that, to me, is not necessarily so helpful.”
In response to Delgado Alcega, Shiva wrote in an emailed statement that she “differentiated between fossil fuel based societies, and societies that function as part of nature’s systems, cycles and biodiversity.”
Carter S. H. Smith, a seminarian at the Harvard Divinity School, said she appreciated the chance to hear Shiva speak in person.
“It’s been really cool because I think I usually hear her talk in much more focused ways about agriculture and seeing all of the interactions with so many issues is really exciting,” she said. “And I’m glad these interactions are happening here.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. pulled off a shocking victory in the Massachusetts Democratic primary Tuesday, where he finished ahead of United States Senators Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).
Biden’s win came despite the fact that he did not campaign in the state. Sanders finished in second place and — in a blow to her presidential bid — Warren finished third in the state she represents.
“This is almost fully a story of Biden’s momentum over the last couple of days,” Harvard Government Professor Jon C. Rogowski said Tuesday night as results rolled in.
Super Tuesday breathed new life into the Biden campaign more broadly, which appeared feeble less than one week ago. Biden won big in several southern states including Alabama and Arkansas. He also pulled off a victory in Minnesota shortly after receiving an endorsement from U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.).
Tuesday’s results come just days after Klobuchar and former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Peter P. M. Buttigieg ’04 both suspended their campaigns and announced they would back the former vice president.
“I think there’s this sense of wanting to — if the number one task is to defeat Donald Trump — coalesce around a candidate,” Massachusetts Democratic strategist Scott Ferson said.
Noah A. Harris ’22, a student from Mississippi who initially supported U.S. Senator Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), said he voted for Biden because he had the “best combination of alignment” with his personal political stance.
“Who I think could beat Donald Trump, that’s what it came down to,” he said.
Rajvir Batra ’22, who also supported Biden, said he was pleasantly surprised by Biden’s success in primaries nationwide.
“I was not expecting this at all,” he said.
Massachusetts voters delivered Warren, a former Harvard Law School professor who has represented the state in the Senate since 2012, a stinging defeat.
Ferson said he thinks the lackluster finish on home turf will likely be “fatal” for Warren.
Warren held her only Super Tuesday campaign event in Massachusetts Tuesday morning. Hundreds of enthused supporters lined the streets outside her house in Cambridge to greet her as she went to go cast her ballot at the Graham & Parks School.
“I think it’s very hard for her to go to the next state and make the case for being the strongest candidate to beat Donald Trump,” Ferson said.
Ferson added, though, that he does not view the result as a judgement on Warren’s performance as a senator.
“People like her,” he said. “But when you have a multi-candidate choice, you have to pick one. And I don’t think people viewed this in Massachusetts as a referendum on Warren.”
Before Super Tuesday, polls showed Warren and Sanders in a tight deadlock, with Biden polling far below both progressives. Warren supporters at various Cambridge polling locations pointed to her intellect and policy plans as decisive factors.
“I voted for Elizabeth Warren because I think she’d be the best president,” said Caitlin A. Koseck, a 2016 Harvard Law School graduate. “I’ve really liked her since law school.”
In the Bay State Republican primary, President Donald J. Trump trounced former Massachusetts Governor William F. Weld ’66. Weld — who served as governor of Massachusetts from 1991 to 1997 — received less than 10 percent of the vote early Wednesday morning.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s a Saturday night in Ithaca, N.Y., and the Crimson had just let a comfortable 20-point lead splice in half with about six minutes to play. Cornell showed no signs of letting up, persisting with a formidable full-court press.
Frustrated by a slew of turnovers in the prior few minutes, coach Tommy Amaker elected to play five men that few back in October would have expected to be closing out a conference game: Idan Tretout, Rio Haskett, Chris Ledlum, Danilo Djuricic, and Mason Forbes.
It is no understatement that several of the Ancient Eight’s coaches would be tantalized to have such a lineup on their rosters. But for a Harvard team that has been largely molded these past three to four years by what was the tenth best recruiting class of 2016, the symbolism that this lineup imbued could not be more striking.
In the last chapter of the narrative arc of these seniors, it will likely not be individual star power, highlight-reel moments, nor even on-court familiarity that will determine whether they earn the NCAA Tournament berth they have long, long coveted.
Instead, the team must rally around axioms that have long rooted Coach Amaker and the Harvard men’s basketball program: bench and balance, next play and next man up, stay ready so you don’t have to get ready.
These are mantras that have been deeply ingrained in the first-floor locker room at Lavietes Pavilion, so much so that they are reiterated freely upstairs in press conferences and in underground hallways on the road.
To the unaware onlooker, such “Amaker”-isms could be easily brushed off as empty coaching platitudes. But ask any current player or any courtside spectator who can hear the words “Move it” from their coach as Harvard kicks its motion offense in gear, and it is clear that this team has never been about the Zion-esque jaw-droppers, the Harden-esque hero-ball, nor the Lillard-esque logo threes that fill up one’s Instagram these days.
Rather, this team — now more than ever with Seth Towns, Bryce Aiken, and Christian Juzang seemingly having logged their last minutes in a Crimson uniform — will need to play the type of selfless and principled basketball that rewards collective play over individual flair to cement the legacies of the star-laden senior class.
It may not be the most enthralling form of basketball, but as Coach Amaker stated recently, the program has always emphasized ‘substance’ rather than just ‘style’.
This is in no way to diminish the personal accomplishments of these seniors: Chris Lewis will graduate as Harvard’s all-time shot blocker and the ‘inside-out’ glue guy, Aiken will be remembered as a near-unstoppable clutch player in late-game situations, Towns will forever be called an Ivy League Player of the Year. Amaker has made no secret in anointing Bassey as the ‘heart & soul’ of the team and Juzang as the ‘quarterback’. Team ‘energizer’ Rob Baker always seems one block away from lifting up Lavietes, while Henry Welsh has earned an entire team’s trust as a co-captain.
But in many ways, what will be expected of these seniors in the final week of the season — injured and healthy alike — will be a challenge unlike any other: how to contribute positively to a team whose ultimate postseason ceiling may very well be determined by their understudies.
To beat a Yale or a Princeton a second or third time, there is only so much that Lewis can do in the post or that Bassey and Baker can do on the wings. All Crimson supporters would revel to see a huge game from that trio. But as the past three weeks have shown, it has been collective team play, spiced in with sparks from Noah Kirkwood (Penn), Mason Forbes (Princeton), Rio Haskett (Columbia), and Chris Ledlum (Columbia) that have propelled Harvard to six straight victories.
Those contests, including the ending to the Cornell game this past weekend, have all offered glimpses to the Crimson identity after this season. Pre-emptive questions also seem clear: Who will take over the point guard responsibilities with no natural healthy player at the position currently? Who will be Harvard’s lockdown defenders, particularly in guarding the shifty scorers that every team seems to be recruiting in recent years?
These questions of course do not need to be resolved immediately, but it does open up a tremendous opportunity for the ‘understudies’ to send a message. As much as the team will rely on these seniors and celebrate their accomplishments, now is also the time for the next impending era of Harvard Basketball to be tested.
That test will come in two weeks in the Ivy League Tournament, on a court in which the Crimson has not lost this entire season — its own. At the bare minimum, one and likely more than one of those non-seniors will need to contribute in an important way to make it past the weekend.
Equally however, it will be a different type of test for this heralded senior class: the raw talent or physical prowess that they came in as freshman with must be matched with an equal willingness to organize, lead, and galvanize the roster they will soon hand over.
NCAA Tournament berth aside, that responsibility may be a surprising but ultimately most endearing legacy for these seniors.

As the weather begins to heat up, so does blocking drama. With Housing Day right around the corner, we’ve gathered some of the best Housing Day signs from the archives to get you excited about the house you’ll get sorted into (and maybe transfer out of…).
‘Nobody Steals Airpods In Dunster’
We all remember the shocking story of a student being robbed of his Airpods in broad daylight in the Yard. In Dunster, you’ll know your headphones will be safe, day or night, on your walk back to the river. A bonus sign in this photo is Cabot’s poster, “Cabot is a Good House.” Will your Airpods be safe there? We’ll never know, but at least you’ll be in a good house.
‘It’s Going Down, I’m Yelling Timber’ and ‘Treez Nuts’
This sign plays on Currier’s mascot, Woody the Tree, with a classy ode to Pitbull and Kesha. The other sign in the background, “Treez Nuts,” is a timeless take on your favorite comeback. It’s okay if you can’t get “Timber” out of your head now — neither can we.
‘We Can Fulfill Your Fête-ish’
Our new Fête-ish? This amazing sign. There’s nothing better than another excuse to dress up during formal season.
‘Pforzheimer? I Bearly Know Her’
A nice break from Pfoho’s endless artillery of “Pf” puns, this sign blends humor with Pfoho’s adorable polar bear suits (there are ten of them!). The other sign in this photo, “I Cried When I Got Quadded… Tears of Joy,” is truly calling freshman out on their biggest fears, and we love it.
‘Mather: Cockroaches Don’t Live In Concrete’
A cockroach isn’t the ideal blockmate, so it’s a good thing Mather’s found a way to prevent our worst nightmare. Plus, cockroaches shouldn’t be able to make it to the 18th floor of the tower in the first place.
‘Th/Drink Like A Fish’ and ‘Cabot House: Finding Home’
The next time you’re drowning in sweat in Cabot Aquarium, you can rest assured that your new fish identity will save you. We also love the other sign, “Finding Home,” a cute play on Cabot’s fish mascot and the Pixar classic “Finding Nemo.”
Never judge a book by its cover — or a house by its sign. No matter the house (or the quality of its signs), you’re bound to find home. Happy sorting!

Every four years, Super Tuesday marks the day in presidential primary season with the highest number of delegates at stake. In total, the states voting today represent over a third of the delegates who will cast their votes for the Democratic presidential nominee at the Democratic National Convention in July. Between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m., Cambridge voters flocked to polling places — including one at Quincy House and another at Gund Hall in the Graduate School of Design — to cast their ballots. Around 11 p.m., the Associated Press named former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. the winner of the Massachusetts primary.


Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) left her home near the Radcliffe Quadrangle just before 9 a.m. on Tuesday morning. Her husband, Harvard Law School professor Bruce H. Mann, and their dog, Bailey, accompanied her on the walk to her polling place at Graham and Parks Elementary School. Fans cheered as she descended down her steps and greeted her with chants of “Welcome home! Welcome home!”


Onlookers rotated through a bevy of cheers for Warren, including the proclamation, “It’s time! It’s time! It’s time for a woman in the White House,” and “Dream big, fight hard!”


Warren and Mann slowly made their way from their home to their polling place, shaking hands, hugging fans, and greeting neighbors as they went. One onlooker asked Mann who he was voting for. In response, he smiled and said, “Elizabeth!”

 
On her way to the polling place, Warren stopped to speak with two young girls. Throughout her campaign, she has made it a ritual to tell each girl she meets, “My name is Elizabeth and I'm running for president, because that's what girls do” and to lock pinkies with them to symbolize their promise to remember. Afterwards, she hugged the girls, one of whom held a handmade sign.


After voting, Warren stood atop the back of a pickup truck to address hundreds of supporters. “It’s just a typical election day in Cambridge,” she quipped to supporters. “I am so happy to be in the place where Bruce and I have been voting for 25 years, because we’ve been here, every time, with that spark of hope in our hearts, that the vote will matter, that we will build a better country. That’s what this election for me is all about.”


Once she addressed supporters, Warren spoke to members of the press. Asked what “success looks like” on Super Tuesday, Warren said, “It’s to compete everywhere. That’s what this has been about from the beginning.” Warren lauded the “grassroots campaign” that she has run, citing the more than 1.25 million donors to her campaign. “I feel this has been our chance to get our message out, to get in the fight,” she said.

 
Tyler J. Piazza ’21, Sebastian Revel ’21, and Eric K. Jjemba ’21 attended the Institute of Politics’ Super Tuesday Watch Event, all wearing red, white, and blue headbands, to listen to press coverage of results from the 14 states and single U.S. territory hosting primary contests.


Marija Dautartaite followed the results from Super Tuesday at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum, as more than a third of all delegates would be awarded by the end of the night.

 
Institute of Politics Spring 2020 Resident Fellows, including Tiffany Cross, Lord Kim Darroch, Mark Harvey, Rohini Kosoglu, Tara Setmayer, and Governor Bill Walker, analyzed and predicted results from Super Tuesday primaries across the nation, examining potential outcomes for the various campaigns and the Democratic Party more broadly.


As the Institute of Politics' Resident Fellows began analyzing the results from the 14 primary contests, Noah Harris '22 simultaneously listened and watched the initial results for Virginia’s primary on his laptop as reported by CNN.
Across the nation, Super Tuesday was a defining day for both the Democratic party and the Democratic primary election for the U.S. Presidential race. Students across Harvard’s campus participated in rallies, phone banks, and watch parties to demonstrate their support for various candidates. As the crowded primary field is culled down to one nominee over the next few months, students will continue watching with bated breath.
