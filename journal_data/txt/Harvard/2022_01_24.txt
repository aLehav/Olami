After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the United States faces a Covid-19 surge quite unlike any before it, with daily new cases reaching 1 million and a peak potentially yet to come, Harvard’s new pandemic policy flies in the face of both the safety and health of all those affiliated with the University.
In an email sent to the Harvard community on Jan. 4, University President Lawrence S. Bacow outlined plans for an in-person spring semester along with new pandemic protocols taking effect upon the semester’s start. Although the promise of an in-person semester brings comfort to some degree – that a semblance of normalcy might still be maintained — the numerous changes made to different protocols leave behind a sense of worry. The biggest change being that in place of isolation housing, students who test positive for the virus will instead isolate in place in dorms they may share with any number of Covid-negative and/or immunocompromised individuals.
The justification offered for this change is threefold. First, the University expects to “have large numbers of cases at Harvard,” seeming to suggest that because of the sheer volume of expected cases, there’s not enough quarantine housing and thus, isolating in dorms is the default. Second, Harvard has “near-universal vaccination,” which leads to the third reason, that the Omicron variant, which is responsible for the rampant surge, is said to be less severe than its predecessors, a point cited by Bacow in the email. Administrators believe the reasons behind this drastic protocol change could be of comfort in an unpredictable time. If anything, these reasons only underscore Harvard's lack of care for the safety and health of its community as well as a blatant attempt to protect its own interests.
For a school that’s taken the pandemic very seriously — and rightly so — the past 22 months, these new policies don’t align with Harvard’s previous actions. In March 2020, Harvard was one of the first schools in Massachusetts to move classes online and shut down in the wake of the pandemic. With the considerable influence that the University holds, it’s not surprising that other schools quickly followed suit. The following academic year, while other universities rushed to in-person classes only to be faced with widespread outbreaks, Harvard wisely played it safe, with remote learning and limited campus density. In fall 2021, Harvard re-opened with a vaccine requirement and a rigorous testing regimen that ensured low case numbers throughout the semester. These were the actions of a university that cared about its community enough to go the extra mile to keep it safe. As the pandemic evolved, Harvard’s strategies evolved with it, which made it clear that the school was keeping students’ best interests in mind. Now, the only thing that remains clear is that Harvard is giving up.
Expecting large numbers of cases in the upcoming weeks isn’t a reason to shift from quarantine housing to quarantine-in-place. Rather, having that expectation should prompt the University to search for alternatives and find ways to expand existing isolation housing. With an endowment that soared to over $50 billion last year, Harvard possesses more than enough resources to not put students in the completely unreasonable position of quarantining amongst their peers in the event they test positive. Secondly, a high vaccination rate won’t completely stop the spread of the variant. In Massachusetts, the most vaccinated state in the country, 75% of people are fully vaccinated. Still, the positivity rate in the state soared to over 23% on Jan. 7. Even with a newly instated booster requirement, Covid-19 can run rampant throughout campus and Harvard is accepting that, putting people at risk in the process.
It’s not enough to say the Omicron variant has “less serious consequences” and leave students to fend for themselves. This flippancy is dangerous, especially for members of Harvard’s community who are immunocompromised. Catching the Omicron variant would not be any “less serious” for them. Clearly, Harvard doesn’t care. If a student hasn’t come into contact with the virus at some point over winter break, Harvard’s new protocol all but ensures they will when they return to campus.
Only after facing pressure from students did Harvard offer minor concessions in a way that makes one wonder why they weren’t given in the first place. In an email sent Jan. 13, the Dean of Students Office detailed additonal protocols for return to residential life, with the added concessions of school-provided rapid tests, HEPA filters, and KN95 masks. Despite vocal student concern, no major changes were made to quarantining guidelines. Students are still expected to quarantine in their dorms, or otherwise figure out isolation on their own, placing the onus firmly on everyone but Harvard. It’s unacceptable. With all the money the school has, and all the time it had to foresee this problem, students should be receiving more than masks and filters.
It’s understandable that Harvard wants to protect the integrity of the spring semester as much as possible, but when huge swaths of the community begin catching the virus and problems mount, the school will only have itself to blame when there’s not much of a spring semester to be had.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We are second-year students at the Harvard Kennedy School, and we are calling on the University administration to do right by the hundreds of Master in Public Policy, Master in Public Administration, and Master in Public Administration in International Development candidates in the Class of 2022 whose educations have been disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic. We urge the administration to let us extend our time on campus by giving our class a “flex semester” option — the same option that was offered to the Class of 2021, who faced similar disruptions as we did. In light of the uncertain impact of the pandemic on our spring, the flex semester is the safest way to help us make the most of our severely impacted graduate school experience.
For the majority of our time at the Kennedy School, we’ve been largely cut off from what makes HKS special: the people and the community they create together. We’ve had fewer opportunities to learn from our peers, less time to build relationships with faculty and staff, and limited access to research centers, guest speakers, and career events. Our academic learning, our social experience, and our professional development — all together culminating in the quality of our education — have suffered.
Surging Covid-19 caseloads could send us back to online learning at any point in this semester. We support a strong public health response to safeguard the wellbeing of the campus community and of our neighbors in Cambridge, Boston, and beyond. But we expect the administration to work with us to find creative, meaningful ways to make the most of our Kennedy School experience — which we’ve paid full tuition to receive.
A flex semester option would allow us to make up for what was lost by extending our time on campus by one extra “flex” semester — either next fall or next spring — without having to pay additional tuition. The administration rightly offered this option to the Class of 2021, but so far has denied our requests for similar treatment, despite the fact that we have now spent a similar amount of time in Zoom school as the previous class did.
In multiple meetings since October, the Kennedy School leadership has made us aware that offering a flex semester would have a negative impact on the HKS community, without providing much detail on the flex semester’s challenges or how we could manage them. The presence of Class of 2021 flex students on campus last fall should tell us that these challenges can, in fact, be overcome.
We’re disappointed that our extended presence at HKS is seen by the administration as a burden, when we feel that allowing our class to stay on campus for one more semester would greatly benefit the Kennedy School community. We’ve experienced firsthand how sharing campus with current flex students has enriched our learning, in and out of the classroom. Many students in the Class of 2023 understand this, too; we’re grateful to the 166 first-year students who signed a solidarity petition calling on the administration to offer us a flex semester.
When we accepted our offers of admission to the Kennedy School in the spring of 2020, we did so in the face of significant uncertainty. Much like today, Covid-19 cases were surging, our family members and friends were getting sick, and economies around the world were shutting down. And yet, deferring our education wasn’t an option for most of us: we had given up jobs, made plans to move our families across the globe, or spent years applying for scholarships to be able to attend Harvard.
We knew that we might face restrictions and the possibility of online learning for some time. But we committed to the Harvard Kennedy School because we expected every effort on the part of the University to provide us with the world-class education that drew us here in the first place.
We’re tremendously grateful to the administrators, faculty, staff, and our classmates for working so hard to make the most of our time together, while protecting public health. Nonetheless, we feel that the University’s actions so far have failed to deliver the education we paid to receive. For the dozens of students who expressed interest in a flex semester, offering this option is a meaningful way to make up for the disruptions caused to our education by the Covid-19 pandemic.
We also know that not everyone will be able to extend their education by one semester. That’s why we urge University leaders to continue doing all they can to ensure that classes are held safely in-person this spring, and to consider other accommodations for students who can’t take a flex semester. In light of the Kennedy School’s recent budget surplus, such accommodations could include reduced or refunded tuition for any additional time we spend learning online, or expanded alumni benefits and social programming for the Class of 2022.
We want to partner with student government and the administration to develop a safe and effective flex option that works for everyone involved. As we head into our final spring semester at the Kennedy School, we’re convinced that this is the right and fair thing to do, both for our class and for the Kennedy School community at large.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I am a student at Harvard.
It seems almost ridiculous to even utter those words, let alone type it out. I allow this fact to escape my mind and sight whenever possible because ignoring it allows me to concentrate on my end goals with humility.
What Harvard students such as myself cannot escape, however, are the tourists on campus. We awkwardly stumble through the families hoisting their children up to touch the famous foot of the John Harvard statue. We tediously navigate up the stairs of Widener Library to bypass any possibility of photobombing a future Instagram post. We scrupulously shutter our blinds in an attempt to shelter ourselves from being peeked at outside our windows.
Tourism perpetuates campus life every day; Harvard’s museums alone draw more than 650,000 visitors annually. My daily sightings of tourists on my walk to my Life Sciences 50 class are an incessant reminder of the fact that Harvard isn’t just a college — it is a destination.
We will never be able to break away from the tourists and the public eye. Yet, this reality is a truth we should be grateful for.
Tourism should represent more to us than just flocks of strangers on campus: we must recognize tourists as a symbol of our privilege and our responsibility to utilize the vast opportunities granted to us as Harvard students.
We become desensitized to “normal” sights such as Memorial Hall and Annenberg. We spend countless hours in Widener Library staring at our laptop screens, failing to become entranced in the 3.5 million books surrounding us. What we consider our monotonous and unchanging daily routine is viewed as exceptionally unique to those outside of the Harvard bubble.
I myself was once one of these tourists. During the summer after fourth grade, my family traveled to Boston and decided to pay a visit to Harvard before we left. My vision of Harvard at the time was one of innocent admiration; I was utterly impressed by the school for its prestige and high rankings. My nine-year-old self deemed Harvard an elusive and unattainable pedestal, a college for elites, prodigies, Carnegie Hall performers, and theoretical physics masterminds — a place that would never fit me. I assumed that my first encounter with John Harvard’s golden foot would also be my last.
Yet, 10 years later, I find myself writing this column in my dorm of Pennypacker Hall as a first-year student. The unending strolls of tourists were jarring during my first few weeks of college. Yet, as I rolled my suitcase back into my dorm in preparation for the second semester, I carried a newfound understanding of what Harvard tourism means to me and the campus body as a whole.
Throughout my first semester of college, I had my fair share of frustrations regarding copious assignments, late nights in Lamont, and yawn-inducing morning classes. Encountering tourists across campus, however, left me feeling unjustified in my grievances. As Harvard students, our attention is always directed on another goal: a problem set, an essay, or an A on our next midterm. We become blasé to the awe-inspiring breadth of courses, faculty, resources, and support encompassing us. The Harvard reputation that draws so many visitors to Cambridge is the same world-class stature that we, as students, draw benefit from and take for granted daily.
I do not think I will ever become completely comfortable with the fact that the campus I now call home is also a prime destination for onlookers. What I have come to terms with, regardless, is that this is precisely how my relationship with Harvard tourism should be.
Tourism should make us think. The sight of visitors should leave us contemplating, leave us reflecting, and leave us filled with gratitude. The ebbs and flows of tourism on campus will come and go, but my time here as a student will persist until May of 2025. As Harvard undergraduates, each of us has four guaranteed years on campus. It is both our collective and individual responsibility to make the most of those eight semesters. We should employ our interdisciplinary education, our real-world experiences, and our intrinsic motivations to transform the society we live in today, retaining Harvard’s worthiness in attracting tourists who view this university with such high regard.
My biggest regret will be graduating and leaving this campus feeling like a tourist at a college that I was supposed to make my own. The permanence of my time here is designed to encourage Harvard to change me as an individual while simultaneously uplifting me to leave behind a deeply-rooted impact on the institution itself. Many tourists perceive Harvard students as the future visionaries, innovators, and reformers of society — we owe it to them to never stop striving for our wildest aspirations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard undergraduates participated in a virtual course preview period last week, marking the fourth straight semester without shopping week — a longtime scheduling quirk that allows students to sample classes before enrolling.
Despite returning to in-person classes this fall, the College opted to forgo in-person shopping weeks for the 2021-2022 school year, citing Covid-19 concerns. Over course preview period — which took place from Jan. 14 to Jan. 20 — students attended optional introductory Zoom sessions, perused course syllabi, and watched class “trailers.”
Some students said they felt the virtual course preview period made course selection more complicated than in-person shopping week.
Victoria M. Zhang ’24, who has never experienced a traditional shopping week, said she found it “very difficult” and “frustrating” to decide on her classes with the virtual course preview format.
“I would like to see a shopping week because I have talked to students who are older than me, and they said they would try out like 10 classes,” Zhang said. “They had the luxury of going to a class for 15 minutes.”
Carolina Ranfagni ’22, who participated in shopping week as a freshman, said she has “no doubt” shopping week is superior to the virtual course previews.
“It definitely adds a layer of pressure having to think about courses a lot more, rather than just bumping into courses and then choosing,” Ranfagni said. “It takes out a lot of the randomness that shopping week had.”
Some students skipped course preview period altogether. Naomi Bashkansky ’25 said she did not utilize the course previews, in part because she believed they would not be as useful as attending the class itself.
“I’d rather sit down in the actual lectures and then just switch classes if need be,” Bashkansky said.
Chloe R. Loughridge ’23-’24 said she did not attend any previews because of a six-hour time zone difference.
Some students said they simulated shopping week by enrolling in extra courses, then dropping some before the deadline to finalize classes.
“For both this semester and last semester, I’ve had to enroll in six classes with permission from my resident dean, and then be forced to drop one of them,” Brian J. Zhou ​’25 said.
Harvard spokesperson Alixandra A. Nozzolillo declined to comment on student criticisms, but wrote in an emailed statement that the College and the FAS Registrar shared resources with undergraduates through many channels before the start of the spring semester.
Other undergraduates said they already had sufficient information for picking classes, utilizing course evaluations — stored on a database known as the Q Guide — and class syllabi.
“I feel I already know what classes I’m taking and then just go through the Q Guide,” Melanie T. Munoz ’24 said.
Over 96 percent of voters supported an Undergraduate Council referendum last semester to “save shopping week.” But just three months later, an FAS committee reviewing Harvard's course regristation system reccomended scrapping shopping week in favor of previous-term registration.
UC President Michael Y. Cheng ’22, who has advocated publicly for restoring shopping week, equated the online replacement to “picking classes in the dark.”
“I know most other colleges don’t do shopping week — Harvard’s unique in that,” Cheng said. “But I don’t think Harvard needs to become like every other college in this way.”
Still, some faculty and teaching staff have criticized shopping week for creating administrative woes and job uncertainty for teaching fellows.
Nozzolillo wrote that the committee utilized student input throughout its decision-making process.
“[Previous-term registration] sounds even worse than what we have right now,” Anthony Y. Tao ’22 said. “Ideally, they would just go back to shopping week.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Kennedy School Misinformation Review has admitted to publishing misinformation.
The journal, published by HKS’s Shorenstein Center, retracted an article last month that concluded a slavery reparations advocacy group discouraged Black voters from participating in the 2020 presidential election.
The group in question, the American Descendants of Slavery Advocacy Foundation, publicly refuted the article’s findings, leading the journal to launch internal and external reviews of the research.
The reviews, which concluded in August, found mistakes and data discrepancies in the study, calling into question its conclusions. The Misinformation Review retracted the article, titled “Disinformation creep: ADOS and the strategic weaponization of breaking news,” on Dec. 20, writing in an editor's note that the authors admitted “defects” in their work.
“The retraction decision was not taken lightly but is one that we feel was necessary, as certain of the principal conclusions reported in this paper cannot be considered reliable or valid,” the Misinformation Review’s editorial staff wrote. “It is important to acknowledge that this outcome also represents a failure of the journal’s editorial process.”
The article underwent three peer-reviews and one editorial review prior to publication, according to Maria Y. Rodriguez, a co-author of the article.
The journal pledged to review its practices “to prevent similar occurrences in the future.”
The article concluded that ADOS used discussions of current events on Twitter to support “anti-Black political groups and causes, strategically discouraging Black voters from voting for the Democratic party.”
The external review — written by Bruce Desmarais of Pennsylvania State University — found that the article relied on a small subset of tweets from ADOS’ co-founders, Yvette Carnell and Antonio Moore, to demonstrate that the group attempted to dissuade its Black Americans from voting — conclusions that were “insufficiently connected” to the quantitative analysis.
In a written response to the Misinformation Review’s retraction that was obtained by The Crimson, the co-authors criticized the Misinformation Review for not conducting a more rigorous pre-publication review of the piece. They added that issues raised post-publication could not have been known at the time research was conducted.
The 10 co-authors also accused the Misinformation Review of failing to defend them against ADOS criticism.
“Instead of using Harvard’s institutional power to shield authors from blowback, the publication risks becoming a lens to focus greater blowback on authors,” they wrote. “At the very least, it should put resources into raising these issues pre-publication, rather than post-publication.”
Rodriguez, an assistant professor at the University of Buffalo, said she still stands by the work.
“I personally think that this paper was done well, and I have received that feedback from colleagues,” she said in an interview. “It's unfortunate that it was retracted, but I don't have control over that.”
Natascha Chtena, editor-in-chief of the HKS Misinformation Review, declined to comment beyond the retraction note.
In a rebuttal to the article published on its website, ADOS denied discouraging its supporters from voting. The organization wrote that it primarily promotes candidates who align with its calls for reparations and aim to break down racial barriers faced by Black Americans.
“In the absence of such a candidate, ADOS has consistently advocated voting down ballot Democrat on Election Day; that is, voting along the Democratic Party line below the President,” ADOS wrote. “This tactic is not, as the report’s authors disingenuously suggest, a withdrawal from the electoral process and civic engagement; nor is it an approach that implicitly indicates support for the Republican Party.”
ADOS’s rebuttal alleged the article was part of a “smear campaign” by progressive political action committee and advocacy group MoveOn, which employed five of the article’s 10 authors at the time of publication. MoveOn “​​assisted with data collection and management,” according to a disclosure in the article.
“With the relatively new Harvard Kennedy School Misinformation Review, MoveOn appears to have found a propaganda-friendly platform to carry out a dishonest delegitimization campaign against our movement,” ADOS wrote.
The Misinformation Review, established in 2019, publishes work from academics studying misinformation and disinformation. Articles are submitted to the journal through an accelerated peer-review system, described on the publication’s website as a “new format of peer-reviewed, scholarly publication.”
The Misinformation Review publishes research within two months after submission, according to the journal’s website.
In its rebuttal, ADOS decried the journal’s fast-track peer-review method, writing that it “de-emphasizes academic rigor in favor of disseminating information that may or may not be accurate.”
Carnell, an ADOS co-founder, frequently used the hashtags #CrimsonSmear and #PoisonIvy in tweets demanding a retraction.
Rodriguez, one of the co-authors, said ADOS “trolled” her as part of its retraction campaign.
“I received lots of mentions from people that I didn’t know who were calling me many things online, to the point where I invested in some sort of third party support for my account,” Rodriguez said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s graduate student union presented University leaders with a list of grievances about the school's updated spring Covid-19 protocols last week, calling for free high-quality masks and expanded testing.
In a letter to administrators last Wednesday, Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers raised concerns that the University’s Covid-19 regulations for student workers will not adequately slow the spread of the Omicron variant. The union also met with University leaders Wednesday, with members offering testimonials.
HGSU-UAW called for increased social distancing in indoor spaces, waivers for mental health costs, undergraduate isolation housing, contract tracing, and improved Covid-19 guidance and accommodations. It also requested booster vaccine access for student workers’ families and HEPA filters in workspaces.
More than 350 HGSU members had signed onto the list of demands as of Wednesday evening, one week after its release. The University has five business days to respond to the complaint, per the union’s contract.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on the letter. He confirmed Harvard will address the grievance in accordance with the contract.
The union previously presented the Covid concerns to the University in the first week of January. HGSU-UAW sent informal complaints to Harvard’s Office of Labor and Employee Relations that outlined preliminary concerns and warned of a possible grievance letter, according to former union president Brandon J. Mancilla.
Mancilla said Wednesday that the union always tries to “alert” the University of its concerns, but sending a grievance letter “adds formality and legality to the equation.”
Undergraduate members of the Student Labor Action Movement signed in support of the HGSU’s requests to the University.
“The union-wide grievance filed by HGSU-UAW is very straightforward and — to us at SLAM — not radical at all,” Prince A. Williams ’25 said.
Mancilla said the union’s safety concerns extend beyond the workplace into Cambridge and undergraduate life.
“We’re not just looking out for ourselves, but we’re looking out for the rest of the community and particularly undergrad students,” Mancilla said.
He added that the union does not plan to disrupt operations with a strike or shutdown in order to secure a University response.
“At the moment, we’re just asking for the flexibility and options to be able to teach safely,” he said.
The grievance letter called on the University to approve all worker requests for isolation after potential exposure. It also pushed for the reinstatement of contract tracing, which the University provided during the fall but scaled back earlier this month ahead of the spring semester.
“Contact tracing is an ‘enduringly important public health tool’ that provides vital protection against the spread of COVID-19,” it reads.
The union also petitioned for heated outdoor dining areas and easily-accessible masks.
“It’s still going to be cold for at least another three months,” Mancilla said. “We should have outdoor heated areas so that we’re not all mask-off eating indoors.”
Mancilla also said that the costs of masks should be covered by the University, rather than left to its student workers. The union’s letter requested two free high-grade masks per week for each employee and urged for consistent masking protocols across Harvard’s schools.
“If every custodian had to buy all their mops, that’s ridiculous,” Mancilla said. “Masks should be seen the same way as those other tools are — as safety gear.”
Harvard’s surveillance testing program currently includes student workers, but is not available to other members of their households. The letter noted that some other peer institutions — such as Northeastern University, Syracuse University, and the University of Illinois — have already expanded their Covid-19 testing programs to include family members of workers.
“Harvard has a remarkable testing infrastructure, which could accommodate these additional people and further ensure that we have as safe and healthy a campus as possible for the community, as a whole,” the letter states.
HGSU-UAW called on the University to act on its demands immediately.
“We believe that once implemented, these requests will live up to Harvard’s commitment to a safe work environment and allow the Spring plans to continue with less disruption and risk for everyone,” the letter reads.

Some Harvard professors will hold classes online during the first week of the spring semester, citing Covid-19 concerns.
Harvard told faculty members earlier this month they would be able to hold classes remotely during the opening week of the semester, when Covid cases are expected to surge.
“When students return to campus, we expect to see a surge in cases and we realize that it may be difficult for instructors to manage large numbers of students in isolation all at the same time,” Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh wrote in a Jan. 18 email to faculty members.
But the flexible policy will not last: Courses must be taught in-person for the remainder of the semester unless instructors obtain special permission, Claybaugh wrote.
Covid cases on Harvard's campus have surged to their highest rates ever this month. During the first week of January, when most students were away from campus for winter break, Harvard reported 977 positives, shattering its previous record — which was set just three weeks prior. Still, the University opted to bring students back for an in-person spring semester, citing the decreased risk of severe illness the Omicron variant presents to most students.
Several instructors decided to take advantage of the policy, forgoing classroom instruction in favor of Zoom for the first week.
Harvard School of Public Health Professor Susanne J. “Sue” Goldie wrote in an email that she decided to teach Gen Ed 1063: “World Health: Challenges and Opportunities” online for the first week to reduce risk of infection and create greater learning equity among students, some of whom might be in isolation after testing positive.
Goldie also wrote that she wanted to reduce the risk of Harvard affiliates passing along the virus to vulnerable family members and avoid contracting the virus herself.
All instruction for Chinese BB: “Elementary Modern Chinese” and Statistics 171: “Introduction to Stochastic Processes” will also be held online for the first week.
“This could actually help us see each other's face for the first time,” said Chinese BB course head Yuxiao Du.
Statistics Professor Subhabrata Sen said some students told him they might not be able attend the first lecture of his course in-person.
Some classes will adopt a hybrid approach. Government Professor Sarah J. Hummel will host in-person classes at the normally scheduled time, but will also re-teach the lectures online in the evening for Government 1249: “Authoritarianism.”
Claybaugh wrote in her email to the FAS that instructors may hold classes online during the rest of the semester if over 40 percent of students in the course go into isolation at the same time.
Claybaugh also asked instructors to make a plan for maintaining course continuity through potential disruptions, though she noted that they are not obligated to offer hybrid instruction.
Taruna Singh ’24 said she believed students did not receive enough information about why some professors elected to make courses online for the first week and not others.
“If my Chinese Literature class is going online and my other classes aren't, I don't see how I'm supposed to receive any sort of protection from the infectious nature of the virus,” she said.
Harvard spokesperson Alixandra A. Nozzolillo pointed to measures taken by Harvard University Health Services to reduce the risk of transmission.
For students who test positive after the first week, some courses will offer a live virtual option.
History 97: “What is Urban History?” and Government 40: “International Conflict and Cooperation” will allow isolating students to join the class on Zoom.
For those students unable to Zoom, Government Professor R. Stephen Chaudoin said he will also offer students a recording, though he does not want students to “rely on recordings as a crutch.”
“I think engaging and talking and seeing things live is really important,” he said.
Many instructors and students remain hopeful that they will return to in-person class after the first week.
“My sincere hope is that this turns out to be just a precautionary measure, that we can move forward with normal in-person classes starting next week,” Sen said.

Harvard students returned to Cambridge en masse over the last week to significantly-changed campus Covid-19 restrictions.
Grappling with the fast-spreading Omicron variant, the University now requires students who test positive for Covid to isolate in place — not in school-run isolation housing. It also stopped conducting contact tracing earlier this month, asking affiliates who test positive to notify their own close contacts of potential Covid exposure.
“The updates to guidance and protocols we have made recognize the unprecedented number of cases within our community,” Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen wrote in a Jan. 12 email to Harvard affiliates.
University administrators have said they expect cases to rise during the opening days of the semester. The school hasn't yet seen an overwhelming surge — but 425 affiliates have tested positive in the last seven days, according to the University's Covid-19 dashboard, compared to only 140 in the week after Thanksgiving break.
With most undergraduates just returning to Cambirdge, most cases this month have been among faculty, staff, and graduate students.
Harvard encouraged students to complete Covid-19 tests prior to arriving on campus. The tests, provided through Color Genomics, were mailed to students upon request.
Upon arriving on campus, undergraduate students were required to complete a rapid antigen test and then begin taking PCR swabs three times per week. Indoor social gatherings will be “limited in size” for at least the first two weeks of the spring term, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay wrote in a Jan. 5 email to Harvard affiliates.
The University provided students with HEPA filters in their dorm rooms and it will give out high-quality masks upon request.
Harvard will provide only grab-and-go meals for the first two weeks of the semester, leaving dining halls empty.
The University will also allow instructors to hold classes remotely for the first week of the semester.
The changes to campus public health guidelines come as the positivity rate in Cambridge sits at above 8 percent. More than 1,000 people have tested positive for the virus in the city over the last seven days, but cases have begun to fall from a peak in early January in both Cambridge and Boston.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of students founded the Harvard Undergraduate Tibetan Cultural Association to promote Tibetan culture and awareness this month.
Students involved in the group’s formation said the association aims to bring together Tibetan students on campus in celebration of their heritage.
“The very nature of our collective existence here as Tibetans in Harvard is truly powerful,” said Tsering Yangchen ’25, who organizes events for the association.
“Just acknowledging our presence here, by allowing the creation of this club in itself, is a huge accomplishment,” Yangchen added.
Tenzin Y. Dadak ’25, one of the group’s founding members, said the organization plans to serve as a cultural space for both students of Tibetan heritage and those interested in Tibet.
“It’s for us as Tibetans and it’s also for people to just learn about Tibet, apart from its political identity,” she said.
Dadak said the group also provides an opportunity to raise awareness of important aspects of Tibetan culture, such as Tibetan Buddhism.
“A lot of our culture — it pertains to compassion, doing well for others, celebrations, and things like that,” she said.
In addition to its cultural function, Yangchen said she believes the club highlights the 1950 Chinese annexation of Tibet, which its exiled government says has resulted in the erosion of Tibetan culture.
“In some ways, it’s a form of resistance to that cultural genocide and a way to also just preserve our culture, which is pretty much dying out right now,” Yangchen said.
The Tibetan Cultural Association has some events planned for the near future, including a Tibetan New Year celebration in March.
Dadak explained that the event intends to immerse students in Tibetan culture, such as through trying khapse, a traditional biscuit specific to the New Year festivities.
Yangchen added that the group is considering holding an annual event to celebrate Tibetan culture.
“We’re thinking of having an annual trademark event of sorts that will get people not only learning about Tibetan culture and various aspects of it, but also just to have a good time,” Yangchen said.
On a regular basis, Dadak said the group also hopes to organize “White Wednesday,” or Lakhar — a tradition that began after the Tibetan government went into exile, meant to celebrate Tibetan culture.
Yangchen said she hopes the club’s reach will eventually extend to undergraduates who do not call Tibet home.
“Something that we have in mind for the future is to hopefully make it into a more sustainable group so that even non-Tibetans who are interested can take leadership roles,” she said.
Dadak noted she hopes the group’s presence will create visibility for Tibetan students in general, beyond Harvard’s campus, and ultimately inspire more high schoolers to apply to elite educational institutions.
“Hopefully seeing these groups and seeing Tibetans doing well, even in exile, would be a good motivator for them,” Tenzin said.
Another co-founder Choetsow Tenzin ’23, a Flyby editor, said she believes the association will be able to encourage students of Tibetan heritage to aspire to attend Harvard and other top universities and share Tibet’s unique culture.
“My biggest hope is that the Harvard community welcomes us and tries to understand who we are, and is willing to learn what we have to offer as an organization,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 25, 2022 at 2:14 a.m. 
The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to take up a pair of lawsuits challenging race-conscious admissions policies at Harvard and the University of North Carolina, setting the stage for a high-stakes decision that could determine the future of affirmative action in higher education.
The lawsuits, both brought by the anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions, charge that Harvard College and UNC discriminate against Asian American applicants and violate civil rights law by considering race in their admissions processes. Lower courts have ruled in favor of both schools, which deny the allegations.
The suits, which justices will consider together, will be the first major affirmative action case to come before the court’s recently-expanded 6-3 conservative majority.
SFFA first sued Harvard in 2014, arguing that the school’s admissions processes violate the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bans institutions that receive federal funds from discriminating “on the grounds of race, color, or national origin.”
A federal judge ruled in favor of Harvard in 2019, a decision upheld by an appeals court in 2020. SFFA appealed the case to the Supreme Court last February.
SFFA asked the Supreme Court in November to hear the Harvard case alongside a similar lawsuit it filed against UNC, arguing that the cases address similar legal issues. The UNC suit also introduces questions regarding the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution’s Fourteenth Amendment because the school is a public institution, SFFA claims.
In its petition to the Supreme Court for the Harvard case, SFFA asked the justices to overturn precedent set by the 2003 case Grutter v. Bollinger, in which the court ruled that the consideration of race in college admissions is legal. In May 2021, Harvard asked the court to reject SFFA’s appeal, writing in its opposition brief that the group “produced no persuasive evidence to support its legal claims.”
The Supreme Court delayed taking action on the case in June by asking the U.S. Solicitor General to weigh in on the lawsuit. Last month, the Biden administration backed Harvard, urging the court to deny SFFA’s appeal — a reversal from the federal government’s stance during the Trump administration.
The court is likely to hear the case in the fall, rather than later this term.
Constitutional law expert and Harvard Law School professor emeritus Laurence H. Tribe ’62 said Monday that it is “likely to be one of the early cases” next term, though he added that it is “conceivable” the court could schedule an additional argument this spring given how long the case has been on the calendar.
SFFA was founded by anti-affirmative action activist Edward J. Blum, who has spearheaded more than two dozen lawsuits challenging affirmative action and voting rights laws around the U.S.
Blum, who is not a lawyer, backed a lawsuit challenging the University of Texas at Austin’s race-conscious admissions process that the Supreme Court narrowly rejected in 2016 — its last major affirmative action decision.
In a statement Monday, Blum, lauded the court’s move to take up the case.
“Harvard and the University of North Carolina have racially gerrymandered their freshman classes in order to achieve prescribed racial quotas,” he wrote. “Every college applicant should be judged as a unique individual, not as some representative of a racial or ethnic group.”
Harvard University President Lawrence S. Bacow decried the court’s decision.
“The Supreme Court decision to review the unanimous decisions of the lower federal courts puts at risk 40 years of legal precedent granting colleges and universities the freedom and flexibility to create diverse campus communities,” he wrote in a statement Monday morning. “Considering race as one factor among many in admissions decisions is essential to the educational missions of institutions across the country—and to the success of students everywhere.”

Ever seen a super fit and athletic-looking person? That was me for 50 days. Well, 50 days minus a few, due to a slight snafu with my NCAA eligibility clearance. What prompted me to sign up for Novice Crew? I’m still not entirely sure. However, as soon as I got added to the Varsity Club email list (and got kicked out of practice due to said NCAA eligibility issues), I realized that I was actually somewhat legit. Since the Novice Crew season has come to a close, here are some of the things I learned during my time as a D1 athlete.
Physical activity is not fun. Don’t let them convince you otherwise.
Working out until I’m almost throwing up and passing out sounds so much fun! Said no one ever. There were several moments during practice when I seriously questioned why I was voluntarily there. And our workouts were objectively not difficult. Not to feed into anyone’s superiority complex, but I have a serious newfound respect for athletes — their mental and physical strength is off the charts.
In a sense, scooters are actually necessary.
Walking back and forth from the boathouse actually did eat up a decent amount of time. I can’t even imagine how long it would take to walk to the athletic complex in Allston every day. While I hate to admit it, scooters are a pretty practical item. I do still think we need to institute a scooter competency test to help people learn common decency traffic laws (I was once *almost* run over by a scooter, and I haven’t fully emotionally recovered).
Mixers are difficult to plan.
For the entire three-month season, we tried to plan a Novice Crew mixer. It never happened. For some reason, coordinating three hours of free time among four teams was too difficult a task for us NARPs. While I resent the *real* athletes for their weekly functions and colonization of Tasty Burger, honestly props to them for their organizational prowess.
Drama. Oooooo. 
Sports are stressful. And just like sibling relationships, there is little to no way one can spend that much time with the same group of people without a little light drama. I would now like to take a moment to propose a Cheer-like reality TV show following Harvard athletes.
Most importantly, teams are fun! I loved all my teammates and looked forward to practice everyday. Harvard can certainly be overwhelming, but being on Novice Crew provided me with an incredibly supportive community as I transitioned into college life. While the Varsity Lifestyle wasn’t for me, I’m so grateful for the opportunity to cosplay as one of the greats for a couple of months.
