After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On January 28, 2016, The New York Times embarked on a gargantuan feat of performance art: tracking all of President Donald Trump’s insults on Twitter since declaring his candidacy. The performance warranted an equally unprecedented platform, which included a rare two-page spread in the October 24, 2016 print issue of the Times and an interactive, color-coded online version, which has since ballooned to feature 305 unique targets of Trump’s 140-character swords.
At its best, “The 305 People, Places and Things Donald Trump Has Insulted on Twitter” is a bold, comprehensive map of a singular online personality, straying from the traditional listicle or “Twitter reax” format that has come to litter digital media. At its worst, the article is a preposterous art collection of shiny digital objects, obscuring more pressing issues and demonstrating an over-reliance on social media that exacerbates the very problems newsrooms should be solving.
The most memorable investigative journalism can be boiled down to the simple yet arduous act of collecting—of gathering and weaving disparate perspectives into a coherent narrative. One can make an analogy to the art collecting world. When collecting art, the “hunt” is often the most thrilling part of the experience: searching far and wide for the best work, negotiating a fair price with the original owner, and facing competition from other collectors. Even before this “hunt” begins, collectors have to gather extensive information about their objects of interest (Where are they located? What are they worth?) in order to develop an expertise that will shape their collection for years to come. Likewise, smart investigative journalism requires dozens of in-depth interviews, not to mention substantial, carefully-researched background and context.
The rise of Twitter-based journalism has bastardized this collecting culture by reducing the “hunt” to passive scrolling through newsfeeds, and the required “expertise” to practically nothing. Most digital newsrooms are complicit in this reduction; modern journalistic reward structures (read: pageviews and ad revenue) and risk-averse budgets tend to prize scooplets and hot takes over long-term research.
As a result, more writers are collecting tweets as their primary sources, particularly because the natural amplification effect of Twitter’s “retweet” feature allows onlookers to track potential trends or breaking news stories in real time. For this reason, some have argued that Twitter is “next week’s thinkpiece today.”
Accompanying this rush for content, however, is an affinity for more hyperbolic language. “Everyone is talking about it” has become one of the most commonly used phrases in online media—even if the vague concept of “everyone” refers only to Twitter’s declining share of Internet users.
Indeed, there is a significant problem with relying on Twitter as a gauge for public opinion. Firstly, like Facebook, Twitter gamifies users’ abilities to agree with each other in the form of hearts and retweets, inherently disadvantaging independent or unpopular thought. Secondly, Twitter thrives on incrementalism—idea generation in small, easily-digestible, arguably unrepresentative steps, versus bigger-picture moonshots. Hence, a journalistic piece based solely on Twitter could make it more difficult to distinguish mountains from molehills, and in turn could easily manufacture trends such as the rise of the #BernieBro (versus the more organic growth of hashtags like #BlackLivesMatter and #LoveIsLove).
Finally, while human beings have always borrowed ideas from each other, a debate remains over whether ideas on Twitter are truly “open-source” and available for manipulation simply because they surface on a public platform. When you publish a tweet, are you doing so as a private citizen speaking to a niche group of followers, or are you automatically renouncing control and consenting to virality, if you’re lucky enough to be “chosen” by the news hivemind?
In recent press conferences, Trump has called journalists “the most dishonest human beings on earth,” and declared that he will continue to use Twitter to battle them. This means that the media comprise the precise intended audience for his digital collection of diatribes, and are  falling for his trap—relinquishing their prized journalistic “hunt” for the immediacy of his controversy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Among the ballot initiatives for Massachusetts that passed last November, one legalized the recreational use of marijuana for students 21 and older. Despite its legalization, there are no pending changes to Harvard’s prohibition of marijuana, as indicated by Director of Harvard University Health Services Paul J. Barreira—a wise stance, in light of the significant amount of federal funding Harvard receives. Federal exigencies aside, the Harvard administration cannot turn a blind eye to marijuana and its presence on campus that will only grow with its legalization. Instead, the administration must acknowledge the changing political and social climate around marijuana and adapt accordingly, as it would for any other mind-altering substance.
Fortunately, Harvard has already set a precedent for itself. Before freshmen—most of whom are under the legal drinking age—even set foot on campus, they must complete Harvard Proof, a training module in order to learn safe drinking habits. The description of the program’s intent acknowledges that “many students will choose to drink before they are 21”, a statement that embodies the program’s spirit of openness and candor, rather than secrecy and stigma. Furthermore, this training does not stand alone; once they are on campus during orientation, students follow up with a workshop led by Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors.
Harvard must approach marijuana education in a similar manner. The more technical and legal aspects of education, such as the fact that marijuana is legal for those above the age of 21 in Massachusetts but prohibited on Harvard’s campus, could easily be integrated into the curriculum. More personal and interactive aspects could be left for the intimacy of a workshop, where students can form their own judgments regarding marijuana.
Most of all, the administration should not act out of paranoia that students’ habits will change with the increased availability of marijuana, and discourage students from using the drug. In other words, it must not take an overly normative approach towards marijuana. Rather, it should inform students of the existing restrictions on marijuana usage and its potential effects on their health, so that they can formulate their own judgments—an ability that is the raison d’être of a liberal arts education.
In sum, Harvard must to adapt to marijuana. This includes not only making it align with existing smoking rules, but also talking as candidly about marijuana as Harvard does with alcohol during freshman orientation. As marijuana becomes more readily available, administrators and students alike must keep in mind that a greater supply does not mean that necessarily mean that more students will abuse the drug. By taking steps to normalize and objectively educate students about marijuana, Harvard will be able to provide students with the tools they need to make their own informed decisions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If I close my eyes, I can still feel it.
Cashmere worn thin and itchy from repetitive wear. Too-long sleeves rolled up to my elbows. Extra fabric everywhere that hangs like wings when I move my arms. This sweater’s too big, and that’s why I like it. That’s why it’s the only thing I’ll wear. That’s why I, a stringent rule-follower, am breaking my school’s dress code and wearing the color brown—because this sweater camouflages my stomach.
360 Cashmere is a brand that makes lovely sweaters. I hate mine, because I feel chained to it. I fixate, as I always have, on the bit of stomach below my belly button. I wish it were flatter, firmer, more toned, more like a Victoria’s Secret model’s stomach. It disgusts me.
So I wear this sweater whenever I wake up in the morning and feel bloated. I pull this sumptuous brown cloak over my head and it hugs me. And it covers me. And at first, it’s a comfort.
Then, suddenly, it isn’t. I’m wearing it more often—almost every day. I’m sick of the color. I’m tired of rolling up my sleeves all the time. I’m aching to shed it as winter turns to spring and wearing cashmere means overheating. I’m longing for the courage it would take to wear something that fits. But I can’t wrench this suffocating sheath off of my body.
I’ve told myself that this is the only thing I look good in, and now I can’t feel beautiful in anything else.
If I close my eyes, I can still feel it.
My searing waistband cuts with every step. In the streets of an old French beach town, I’m sucking in my stomach too much to talk or enjoy the new culture. I’m focusing on the way my pants feel—restrictive, claustrophobic, too tight—instead of laughing with my study-abroad peers.
The black pants I’ve brought with me on this trip are too small. It’s been a while since I wore them last, and even as I pulled them on over my calves three hours earlier, I knew they didn’t fit like they used to. “Maybe I’ve just grown a bit,” I thought to myself.
But when I found that I couldn’t button them comfortably over my stomach, I blamed my wardrobe troubles on an imperfection that always seems glaring to me. “It’s your stomach,” an internal voice hisses. “You’re gross.”
This outfit is uncomfortable by design. I’m torturing myself, wearing jeans that are too tight as if to punish myself for letting them get too tight. As a result, I’m fixating on my outfit, using clothes to heighten my own insecurities. I’m trying to teach myself a lesson, trying to guilt myself into working out more or eating fewer desserts.
In doing so, I’m telling myself in every second of my evening that my worth can be quantified by a number like my jean size. I’m teaching myself that other people care about my looks more than my personality. I’m succumbing to superficiality, and my clothes are helping me do it.
I’ve written before and will write again about the times my outfit has made me feel like I could conquer the world. It’s true: A pair of heels can uplift you. An ensemble can make you feel so great that you stop worrying about how you look and start focusing on how you feel, what you think, and what you want to do to change the world. I know these things are true, because there’s research to prove some of it, and I’ve lived the rest.
But in order to talk responsibly about fashion and why I love it, I need to acknowledge that clothing is a tool with considerable inherent power. Like a brick or a saw or a knife, it can be used to create something new and good. But in the hands of a self-conscious girl, it can turn into a violent weapon.
While the bodies in magazines today are certainly beautiful, they all look similar. As a result, the fashion industry teaches by example that clothing looks good on only one type of body. Maybe we need to add more magazines to newsstands, diversify the look of the models on runways, or make room for a more diverse legion of fashion decision-makers. In the meantime, we need to talk about the types of bodies and faces that we don’t see on runways, in magazines, or in ads. We need to talk about how those people are beautiful too.
If I don’t talk about these things, I’ll forget that they’re true, and I’ll let my jeans squeeze me to death.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Zoe: It started before ballots were cast on a somber day in November, before the stroke of a pen on a piece of paper which banned travel to seven different countries. It began with the arrival of immigrants, political refugees who fled a country they no longer believed in, coming to North America and taking land that was not theirs to take. It began with the first white man who decreed this country into existence, as if there were not hundreds of Indigenous nations already existing. In 1776, an America was born in which being American meant having white skin and being male. But, more so than anything, what has been thought of as true since our conception as a country is that by being an American you are free in speech, in religion, in assembly, and most importantly, in movement, whether that is across the country or across the world. The definition of who is American has expanded through fights led by members of one or more disenfranchised groups. They sought, and continue to seek, to be recognized as equal, even as laws have encouraged racial profiling and disenfranchisement of marginalized communities, laws which have only pushed people of color to the fringes of society.
Ruben: Having been born with full legal citizenship, yet denied cultural citizenship, has forced me into a borderland “where the Third World grates against the first and bleeds.” The distinction, American but hyphenated, suspended me between the United States and El Salvador. My ability to cross borders, wielding the blue and gold of my American passport, molded me to my core. I’m the awkward brown boy from a Southern Californian suburb, but I’m also the brown boy with the terrible Spanish accent who tried desperately to fit in on his grandparents’ farm in San Vicente. On my flights home, packed alongside souvenirs, semita, and fresh cheese, I brought a new worldview that understood that the United States’ standard of living is a luxury, and that we aren’t the only country that exists or matters. Up until last week, my worldview, rooted in a transnational understanding of the world, was respected for its biculturalism. But today, I worry about what it means to be an American whose heart partially lives out of this country’s borders.
Z: Borderlands were slowly being demolished with every ballot cast from the hands of those who fought to be recognized as American, as equal. Walls were torn down with the election of every person who wasn’t a straight, white man by every person who was of one or more marginalized communities. Bridges were built as we worked towards the multicultural democracy that didn’t attempt to erase our individual identities in a dangerous melting-pot analogy. Today, we live in a nation that has gone almost 100 years backwards, actively pushing women, immigrants, and people of color into the shadows, stripping them of their American identity without consent, ripping away their liberty from behind a desk that was created to protect the American people. When did I stop being considered American? When did I stop being free? I thought we were taking steps in the right direction toward a better future on the horizon, a future where no American would feel like they existed in a borderland in which their equality and their liberty weren’t completely guaranteed.
R: Growing up, I was told that accepting others, regardless of differences, was expected of me. America was built by, and is now for, the former slave, the immigrant, the Native. When I came to Harvard and felt too poor or too brown, I remembered my Salvadoran cousins’ calloused palms against my soft skin. I remembered when, as we fed his family’s cows in El Salvador, my cousin told me that Harvard was the only university he’d ever heard of. I stopped worrying about wealth and whiteness because I had the perspective of a world outside these borders. There is strength in living in a borderland, and, while it is painful—what Anzaldúa calls una herida abierta—it can also be a source of strength. The problem is that the current administration is attempting to curb the way we’re allowed to explore our borderlands and our multiculturalism. By trying to move the United States into a state of isolation, we begin to lose the benefits of being a nation sustained by immigrants.
R+Z: The issue with what has already proven to be a clumsy and inhumane immigration policy is that it erases the sense of progress that marginalized people in this country had been lulled into believing. Starting with a Muslim ban, and changes to DACA that seem imminent, we’ve seen a resistance to migration based in blanketed, overgeneralized fear that has never proven productive. This is just one instance of this administration threatening to reject our place in this country. The subtlety of this truth, of the lie that we don’t belong, is gone. People will say to our faces that our immigrant narratives, our lives on the borderlands, and our melanin are now worth questioning. But, as a friend put it as we conceptualized this article, “this is central to who we are as people.”
As Latinx Americans, we must resist as a way of ensuring our humanity. That has been clear to us for years. The bigger issue lies with anyone who has not lived in a borderland. If you’re able to exist in this country without wondering if it’s yours, stand up. There is no room for apathy when lives are at stake and when families are being torn apart. If you’ve been a person who has been able to afford the luxury of apathy, speak up now. Support those who can’t. It’s on you to understand the power of our borderlands, and to help others realize that our histories of immigration are what make America great.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 30, 2017 at 10:46 a.m.
University President Drew G. Faust called on “the administration, the Congress, and the courts” to reconsider an executive order blocking immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States in a sharp defense of the University’s “vital interests” Sunday.
Administrators across the University—including the deans of the College, Law School, Business School, and Medical School—also criticized the order in emails to their respective schools.
In her email sent to the University, Faust outlined a number of resources Harvard will provide to affiliates affected by the order, which prevents immigrants from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen from entering the United States for 90 days. The order, signed by President Donald Trump Friday, also bars all refugees for 120 days and Syrian refugees indefinitely.
At least two Harvard affiliates have been blocked from entering the United States since the order took effect. Faust directed affiliates to a statement released by the Harvard International Office Saturday advising foreign nationals not to leave the country.
Harvard will hold a town hall meeting Wednesday in Science Center B to discuss the implications of the immigration order for international affiliates.
In her message Sunday, Faust reiterated the University’s support for its undocumented students, writing that Harvard Law School’s Immigration and Refugee Clinic had hired a full-time attorney dedicated to representing undocumented students and launched a website providing resources for those students. She pledged to continue lobbying members of Congress to pass the BRIDGE Act, which would provide protections for undocumented students.
Faust also asserted the importance of the University’s global reach and affirmed Harvard’s commitment to its international affiliates and programs.
“Nearly half of the deans of Harvard’s schools are immigrants—from India, China, Northern Ireland, Jamaica, and Iran,” Faust wrote. “Benefiting from the talents and energy, the knowledge and ideas of people from nations around the globe is not just a vital interest of the University; it long has been, and it fully remains, a vital interest of our nation.”
Faust wrote she will lobby lawmakers to reverse restrictions imposed by the order.
“Amid this widespread doubt and unease, we will continue to insist that policymakers take full account of how fundamentally our universities depend on the ability of people to travel across borders without undue constraint,” she wrote.
In her email, Faust noted the concerns of Muslim Harvard affiliates in particular and emphasized the importance of religious tolerance.
“Ours is a nation founded and built on the bedrock of religious pluralism and religious freedom,” she wrote. “Our University embraces that commitment, in the spirit not of mere tolerance but of genuine inclusion. We must not and will not conflate people of a venerable faith with people predisposed to acts of terrorism and violence.”
She wrote that she has begun a search for the University’s first Muslim chaplain, a measure members of the Harvard Islamic Society called for in a letter to Faust last week.
“I hope that this new appointment will bring a welcome measure of further institutional support for valued members of our University who have particular reason to feel a sense of vulnerability at this time,” Faust wrote.
Anwar Omeish '19, Director of External Relations for the Harvard Islamic Society, said she is happy the University is searching for a chaplain.
“I’m glad to see that the administration is taking our concerns seriously,” she said. “We’re excited to have a chaplain that serves as a real mental health resource and spiritual resource, especially in this difficult time.”
She also said she is encouraged that the University is providing legal resources to students and putting “sustained pressure on policymakers.”
Bushra Hamid ’20, who is Syrian-American, called Faust’s announcement about searching for a Muslim chaplain “amazing.”
“We’ve been waiting for that, and I think it’s time for a full-time Muslim chaplain,” Hamid said. “She even said that a minister in Memorial Church recommended that, so that meant a lot, that Harvard was looking out for us.”
Faust wrote that the University continues to monitor the status of the executive order, which is developing as courts rule on lawsuits challenging the order.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana sent an email to Harvard undergraduates Sunday night urging students to read Faust’s earlier message and stating the College is “working closely” with the University’s International Office to support students affected by the immigration ban.
Khurana also wrote that he was personally disappointed with Trump’s executive order.
“As a first-generation immigrant born to parents who were once refugees, I am both saddened and alarmed by Friday’s Executive Order on immigrants and refugees,” he wrote.

UPDATED: January 30, 2017 at 10:49 a.m.
Cambridge, one of hundreds of U.S. cities deemed a “sanctuary” for undocumented immigrants, stands to lose funding from the federal government following President Donald Trump’s executive order stripping funds from “sanctuary cities.”
The order, signed Jan. 25, targets cities that do not prosecute individuals who come to the United States without official documentation. Trump has repeatedly said he hopes to tighten immigration policies, suggesting enacting a “deportation force” and building a wall on the country’s southern border.
Following the announcement, a number of Cambridge city officials spoke out against the order and said they will not drop the city’s “sanctuary” label.
According to Cambridge City Councillor Jan Devereux, Cambridge stands to lose more than $15 million in federal funding if the order is enforced, a sum which could impact budget items like public school programs and other city operations. Devereux and other city councillors said they are unsure the extent to which government programs would be affected.
“We’re in uncharted waters. It’s too soon to know everything that will happen.” Devereux said. “The school lunch program is an example of a federally funded program. It’s very important here. Around 45 percent of public school students qualify for free and reduced lunch.”
Another Councillor, Nadeem A. Mazen, said he agreed with Devereux and rebuked the executive orders released by Trump so far.“What we see here is a Donald Trump who is used to strong-arming people into getting his way.” Mazen said. “That’s not going to work here. We’re going to continue to bolster our status as a ‘sanctuary’ city...At this point, it’s questionable whether or not this can even be enforced.”
In a joint statement released on Cambridge’s city website  in response to the order, Cambridge Mayor E. Denise Simmons and City Manager Louis A. DePasquale affirmed the city’s commitment to supporting undocumented immigrants.
"While we do not yet know what impact President Trump’s Executive Order on Immigration will have, as a Sanctuary City, Cambridge will continue to support and promote the safety, health and well-being of all our residents, regardless of immigration status,” the statement reads. “We encourage every resident – regardless of status – to seek and obtain assistance from the many resources available to the Cambridge Community.”
The statement closely echoes comments made by mayors of other major “sanctuary” cities including New York, Los Angeles, and Boston.Speaking at a press conference on the executive order, Boston Mayor Martin “Marty” J. Walsh also reaffirmed his support for “sanctuary” cities and said there was no plan to remove the label moving forward.
“The latest executive orders and statements by the President about immigrants are a direct attack on Boston’s people, Boston’s strength, and Boston’s values.” Walsh said. “We will not retreat one inch.”

UPDATED: January 30, 2017 at 1:31 p.m.
Samir Mitragotri, a bioengineer developing new ways of delivering drugs to patients, will join the faculty of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences in July, marking the school’s first new hire since Feb. 2016.
Mitragotri comes to Harvard from the University of California at Santa Barbara, where he was a professor of chemical engineering and founding director of the school’s Center for Bioengineering. SEAS Dean Francis J. Doyle III, who came to Harvard in August 2015, also previously worked in the chemical engineering department at UCSB.
Mitragotri’s hire comes almost a year after SEAS hired Cynthia Dwork, a theoretical computer scientist from Microsoft Research, who began teaching this month. The two professors are the school’s only new hires since a “bumper crop” of eight new professors—including five computer scientists—began working at SEAS in the fall of 2015.
In Nov. 2014, former Microsoft CEO Steven A. Ballmer ’77 endowed 12 new computer science hires, but the school has yet to fill all of the positions.
Accounting for the slowed faculty growth, Paul Karoff, a spokesperson for SEAS, wrote in an email that “like other units, SEAS experiences peaks and valleys in faculty hiring. Last year we had an unusually large number of successful searches.”
He added that on average, over the past six years, SEAS has hired about four new faculty members per year.
While faculty hiring and overall expansion has been a priority for SEAS in recent years, the school faces major space constraints ahead of its planned move to a new campus in Allston in 2020. Former SEAS Dean Cherry A. Murray, who stepped down at the end of 2014, said in a phone interview that she suspects a lack of physical space is the reason for the lack of new hires.
“There is not enough space to hire, and even as I was stepping down as Dean it was becoming more and more of a problem,” she said. “It’s very hard to hire faculty if there are no offices or labs for them. Until the new building comes up, we will be squeezed.”
Karoff said the shortage of space has resulted in a “slight bias” toward theoreticians—such as Dwork—over experimentalists, who require more space for big laboratories instead of regular offices.
Even with the current “acute shortage of space,” Karoff said SEAS continues to target faculty searches to areas of high need. Bioengineering, Mitragotri’s area of scholarship, is one such priority field. Despite the space constraints, Mitragotri will “have a lab at Harvard similar to the one he ran at UCSB,” Karoff wrote.
Mitragotri said he is “excited to move to SEAS for a number of reasons.” With his work on delivering medicines to patients, he said the relationship between SEAS and the Medical School was something that drew him to Harvard.
While Mitragotri said he could not speak to hiring at Harvard, he said he has seen “a tremendous increase in interest in engineering and STEM fields,” and specifically in bioengineering.
Undergraduate interest in SEAS has also skyrocketed in recent years. In the 2007-2008 school year, SEAS drew 291 undergraduate concentrators. This year, there are 943, according to Karoff.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Joining thousands of academics worldwide, over 190 Harvard professors have signed a growing petition opposing President Donald Trump’s executive order barring immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries.
By Sunday evening, nearly 200 Harvard faculty members from across the University’s schools had signed the petition, entitled “Academics Against Immigration Executive Order.” More than 7,100 professors from across the country have signed the condemnation.
“The unethical and discriminatory treatment of law-abiding, hard-working, and well-integrated immigrants fundamentally contravenes the founding principles of the United States,” the petition reads.
More than 30 Nobel laureates have so far signed the petition, including two Harvard laureates: chemistry professor Dudley R. Herschbach and economics and mathematics professor Eric S. Maskin ’72.
On Friday, Trump signed an executive order preventing citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen from entering the United States for 90 days and indefinitely barring Syrian refugees. After protests against the order around the country, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security John F. Kelly said legal residents from the listed countries would still be permitted to enter the country.
Economics Department Chair David I. Laibson ’88, one of the petition’s signatories, said the executive order was antithetical to Harvard’s values.
“For me, it violates the activities of our community here at Harvard by closing out and disrupting the scholarship of many important members of our community,” Laibson said. “Some of my own students are citizens of these countries and I am now gravely worried about their wellbeing and their ability to conduct scholarship.”
In an email sent to members of the Economics Department, Laibson wrote that he is concerned for students and faculty affected by the executive order and alerted recipients to a protest in Boston’s Copley Square Sunday. In an interview Sunday evening, Laibson said he was “crestfallen” that some Economics students could be unable to continue their studies as a result of the order.
“They are extraordinary members of our community and they are brilliant economists,” he said. “Now they are being told that they are essentially unwelcome in the United States.”
Physics Department Chair Masahiro Morii also sent an email to his department, writing that he hoped “sanity will prevail.” Morii said the executive order could cause significant harm to affected students in his department.
“There are quite a few people in the department, mostly graduate students, who are from the affected countries,” Morii said. “Physics is an international undertaking, and many students have to go to conferences in Europe, Asia, and those opportunities are now barred to them.”
As students and residents protested the executive order in Harvard Square Friday and Copley Square Sunday, Law School lecturer Ian Samuel, took to Twitter. In a post retweeted thousands of times, Samuel offered free legal support to government employees who considered refusing to obey the order.
“Any government official who refuses to execute Trump’s orders on grounds of illegality will receive free representation from me. & I’m good!” Samuel tweeted Saturday.
Samuel said he has since been approached by individuals asking for help and by fellow lawyers offering assistance.
Calling the executive order unconstitutional, Samuel said other Law School faculty should speak out against the Trump administration’s actions.
“I think if you are a member of the Law faculty, you are obligated in some sense to advance rule of law values that are common to all lawyers,” Samuel said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council passed legislation Sunday expanding the  "compelling interests" of the Grant for an Open Harvard College—a $30,000 student initiative fund—to include “race, culture, and faith relations” and “financial accessibility.”
Last year, the grant—which funds undergraduate initiatives from both the College’s and UC’s budgets—gave money to students for initiatives involving four realms of student life: mental health, race relations, sexual assault and harassment, and social spaces. After debate at the UC's Sunday general meeting, representatives voted to expand “race relations” to include students’ faith and culture and added financial accessibility to the grant’s provisions.
The "compelling interests" are meant to guide the grant, which former Council President Shaiba Rather ’17 and Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17 began. The grant is replenished yearly.
Sunday’s legislation, which passed unanimously, initially included the phrase “textbook affordability” for the fifth compelling interest. But Vimal S. Konduri ’17, an inactive Crimson editor, requested a secretarial change to amend the phrase to “course materials,” then proposed an amendment to the legislation changing “course materials” to “financial accessibility.” In an interview after the meeting, Konduri said the amendment, which UC President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 and Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 voted against, would help fund a greater breadth of programs.
“The original text focused on textbook and course material affordability, and I felt it would be difficult for student groups to collaborate specifically on that issue,” he said. “I also felt like we’d be better served broadening it to just ‘financial accessibility’ in general, because that way it could address event costs, as well as course materials.”
Both Khansarinia and Sachee argued that the phrase “textbook affordability” would help the UC sharpen its focus on a particular issue.
"I think that financial accessibility is something the Council should be definitely prioritizing an interest for over the next semester,” Sachee said. “I just was wondering whether the nature of the fund will get too broad and will not allow students and student groups to really focus in on specific issues."
After the meeting, Christopher B. Cruz ’17, who voted in favor of the amendment, said his support stemmed from his desire to see the UC “continue our commitment to students.”
“We must reach out to first-generation students and other students who might not have as much accessibility in other areas as others do,” he said. “I’m very glad to have voted in favor of the amendment, and I think that we’ll be able to really serve the student body in a much broader sense.”
Also at the meeting, Sachee and Khansarinia discussed their intention to form an identity coalition of a diverse group of student leaders. In addition to the meetings, Khansarinia said the group will provide input to the UC when legislation involves issues of race and culture.
“The gist is that we'll bring in outside representatives from cultural groups, identity groups, affinity groups,” Khansarinia said. “If we're bringing up legislation that has to do with race or cultural initiatives, then they can advise us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard affiliates flocked to Boston Logan International Airport and Copley Square this weekend to protest President Donald Trump’s executive order barring immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries.
On Saturday, students joined hundreds of people at Logan Airport who were protesting the executive order, which suspends immigration from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen for 90 days and bars Syrian refugees from entering the United States indefinitely. On Sunday, thousands packed the T's Green and Orange lines to Copley Square to attend the Boston Protest Against Muslim Ban and Anti-Immigration Orders, which was organized by the Council on American Islamic Relations.
At least two Harvard affiliates have been barred from traveling to the United States as a result of Trump’s order.
Students, faculty, and staff from Harvard joined the protests in Boston. About 15 students from the Harvard College Democrats attended the rally Sunday, and the Harvard Economics Department gathered both students and faculty to attend the event. Members of the department carried a sign with the words “Economists Support Immigrants.”
Assistant Professor of Economics Gautam Rao, who immigrated from India to the United States, said he felt that it was his “duty” to be there and that a lot of his “colleagues feel the same way.”
“As academics, we strongly, strongly support people being free to exchange ideas. We have students, we have colleagues from different countries and I myself am an immigrant,” he said. “There’s a reason the United States has the best universities in the world and it’s partly because there’s people from all over the world who are allowed to come here.”
Assistant Director of the Advising Programs Office Brooks B. Lambert-Sluder '05 also attended the rally, carrying a sign reading “This is Solidarity” on one side and “Refugees Welcome” on the other.
“I don’t think I would wear the label of being an activist over my life and I think now the nation is at somewhat of a crossroads,” Lambert-Sluder said. “I think the values of openness and welcoming refugees and a community of immigrants is incredibly important.”
Prominent political speakers including Boston Mayor Martin Walsh, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Senator Ed Markey, and Representative Joe Kennedy also joined the protest at Copley Square and pledged support for immigrants and refugees in the face of  Trump’s executive orders.
Kennedy School student Rana Abdelhamid emceed the protest at Copley Square and co-organized an “Emergency Rally” on campus Friday. She said the executive orders were shocking.
“The fact that you’re going to deny someone entry to a country simply because they come from another country is just clear discrimination,” Abdelhamid said.
Harvard affiliates also travelled to Logan Airport Saturday to participate in the protests happening there. Jonathan S. Roberts ’17 attended the airport rally with a group of College students.
“I would say there was a message of unity and love. One word that kept coming up was ‘solidarity’ and that we will be with our immigrant or Muslim or refugee brothers and sisters,” he said.
Ivy Yard Dean Michael C. Ranen, who was also at Logan Saturday, said the executive orders seemed “hastily done” and left many unanswered questions for international students.
“Harvard students and administration and staff and faculty are just going to have to continue to show support to each other, to our students, and try to answer any questions that we can,” Ranen said.
Devontae A. Freeland ’19 said the protest on Saturday was about more than just Trump’s executive order and immigration policies.
“It wasn’t just ‘No Ban, No Wall,’ which was one of the chants, but there were comments about reproductive rights, queer justices, Black Lives Matter chants, et cetera,” Freeland said. “It was a coming together of all these other coalitions that had existed in the past.”
Going forward, some of the activists said that organizing would continue to play an important role in resisting Trump’s policies. Abdelhamid called on students to support advocacy organizations such as CAIR and Jetpac Inc., the American Civil Liberties Union, and the Muslim Justice League.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off a road split the previous weekend against Ivy foes Brown and Yale, the Harvard women’s ice hockey teams returned to Bright Landry to take on ECAC opponents Cornell and Colgate.
After getting blanked out, 4-0, in its first game against the Raiders (18-7-3, 9-6-1 ECAC), the Crimson (3-15-3, 3-10-3) made adjustments and bounced back less than 24 hours later to force a 2-2 draw against a top-10 ranked Big Red team (14-6-3, 10-3-3)
“It was more of a mental tactic,” co-captain Brianna Mastel said. “We know what we have to do. It’s just a matter of doing it and reminding ourselves how we want to play. [Colgate’s] game wasn’t really our style. W played more on our heels rather than on our toes and [Harvard coach Katey Stone] gave us the reminder that we need to move forward.”
HARVARD 2, No. 8/8 CORNELL 2
Despite converting just nine of 68 power plays on the season, Harvard used the player advantage on Saturday to tie a game after surrendering an early lead to the Big Red.
With just over three minutes remaining in the final period and in a power play situation following a slashing penalty on Cornell defender Erin O’Connor, Mastel gained control at the point following passes by co-captain Sydney Daniels and freshman defender Ali Peper. The co-captain sent a rocket past Big Red keeper Paula Voorheis to tie the game at two a piece.
“Mastel is doing a whole lot for us,” Stone said. “One minute she is playing offense, the next minute we take advantage of the TV timeout and she’s playing defense. And then [she] makes something happen with the big shot on the power play.”
Despite both teams getting a few good looks at goal in the remainder of the third frame as well as the extra stanza, neither side was able to break through. So it was that Harvard picked up its first points of the season against a ranked team.
Less than 24 hours after starting flat against Colgate, Stone changed her team’s lines, opting to go for youth by starting freshmen and former high school teammates Kat Hughes and Val Turgeon on the wings along with junior Lexie Laing–just the second time this season that usual stalwart Daniels was not in the starting six. Peper and sophomore Kaitlin Tse manned the blueline while senior Molly Tissenbaum started between the pipes after rookie Beth Larcom had started the night before.
The changes paid immediate dividends for the Crimson, which was aggressive in the early going with an 8-4 advantage in shots on goal before junior Haley Mullins found the back of the net to give Harvard an early lead.
Though the Crimson took control in the first, it was almost all Big Red for the rest of the period as the Cornell fired off seven shots at Tissenbaum to end with an 11-10 lead in shots on goal.
Harvard was finally broken just over three minutes into the second period as forward Kailin Doering found the back of the net for the Big Red on the power play. Thirteen minutes later, defender Sarah Knee put the Big Red up with a shot from the left circle after the Crimson defense failed to properly clear the puck in a scrum.
While Harvard was ultimately unable to come away with a victory, the result was a positive one going into a big game against Northeastern in the first round of the Beanpot.
“We’re feeling pretty good after tonight’s draw.” Mastel said. “Approaching the Beanpot, it’s different. It becomes a battle of Boston, and it’s a clean slate against everybody. We’re 0-0 against Northeastern this year, and we’re looking to be 1-0 against them.”
COLGATE 4, HARVARD 0
It was a night to forget for the Crimson, as Colgate found the back of the net four times to hand Harvard its 15th loss of the season, the first time Harvard has suffered that many losses since the 1997-1998 season.
“Really disappointing evening for us, there’s no question about it.” Stone said. “I thought we were going to be ready to go…. For whatever reason we were slow getting out of the gate today and didn’t play the kind of defense we needed to play.”
It took just over two minutes for the Crimson to fall behind, as Raiders forward Megan Sullivan poked the puck in from close range past Larcom to open up the scoring before rookie Anonda Hoppner doubled the lead 12 minutes later off a rebound.
Larcom’s night would only last until just over the second minute of the second frame as defender Kaila Pinkney’s blast from the blue line made its way into the goal, forcing Stone to replace Larcom with Tissenbaum.
After being held to just four shots on goal in the second frame, the Crimson managed to blast 15 at Colgate netminder Julia Vandyk in the third period. Once again, though, it was the Raiders who found the back of the net on one of just two shots in the final frame.
Forward Shae Labbe picked up the puck on a break away down the right wing and sent a blast into Tissenbaum’s glove-side corner to put the final touches on Colgate’s comprehensive victory.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past weekend, the Harvard men’s tennis team took on Brigham Young University (2-2), Tennessee (5-2), and Bryant (1-3) on its home turf at the Murr Center Tennis Courts. The Crimson came out with two wins and one loss, boosting its overall record to 4-2.
Highlights of the weekend included a 6-1 dual match win over BYU on Friday and a perfect 3-0 showing from freshman Logan Weber on Saturday.
Harvard 5, Bryant 2
On Saturday, the team had to adjust to playing without its number one singles seed, co-captain Sebastian Beltrame. Against Bryant, sophomore Andy Zhou stepped up to play first seed while co-captain Jean Thirouin played the two seed.
The team swept the singles matches with four victories from Thirouin, junior Grant Solomon, sophomore Sam Beren, and Weber. Zhou and sophomore Michael Peters, at sixth seed, both fell to their Bryant opponents in close three-set matches.
“It’s always tough bouncing back from a loss during a double header, but in those moments you put your own worries aside and do it for your teammates,” junior Kenny Tao said.
Harvard went undefeated on the doubles side, with junior Kenny Tao and senior Brian Yeung making quick work of their opponents in a 6-1 win. Playing the second game of a double-header can be tiresome, but the team came together late.
“I think everyone wanted to go out and compete after losing earlier in the day, and that definitely helped us recover,” Tao said. “Also of course the guys who normally don’t get to play many matches are always willing and eager to step in and compete.”
Sophomore Chris Morrow and Weber claimed a victory at second doubles, Weber’s third victory of the day, and Peters and Beren closed out the ladder with a win at third doubles.
“In the beginning of the season it always takes a little time to adjust,” Thirouin said. “This weekend we really started to see guys settle in more comfortably into their matches.”
Harvard 2, Tennessee 5
Earlier that day, however, the Crimson faced a tough opponent in Tennessee. The Vols took four wins on the singles side in the second through sixth seeds. Tao and Yeung, playing at first and second doubles, respectively, battled it out against their Tennessee opponents in two grueling, three-set matches.
“The standout moment for me was even after we’d lost 4 matches, therefore the overall match, the guys on court kept battling hard and the guys off court kept cheering loudly,” Thirouin said. “Those extra efforts are really going to make a big difference moving forward in the season.”
Tao won a tie-breaker in the first set, fell 6-4 in the second set, and then came out on top with a 6-3 win in the third set. After suffering a 6-1 loss in the first set, Yeung came back to win the second set 6-3 and edge out his opponent in a tiebreaker in the third set.
“Brian’s big win against Tennessee, even though we had already lost, he was playing a spot up from where he usually is, and him winning is a huge confidence boost for himself and us,” Tao said.
Tao and Yeung’s marathon wins did not win Harvard the match, however, and the only other Crimson point of the day came from a doubles win from Morrow and Weber at third doubles.
Harvard 6, BYU 1
On Friday, Harvard started the weekend off with a strong showing against BYU. The Crimson took the doubles point early on with wins from Yeung and Tao at first doubles, as well as Beltrame and Thirouin at second doubles.
On the singles side, Beltrame earned his second victory of the day with a straight-set shutout of his BYU opponent. Tao, Yeung, Solomon and Thirouin also knocked out two-set victories, with Thirouin recording his team best third singles win of the season.
“Against BYU I think we clicked as a team, and it seemed every one of us were playing well,” Tao said. “It isn’t often that you’ll see a match where we are winning on every court, but it seemed that way against BYU.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Getting back into action after a weeklong break, the women’s squash hosted undefeated Tufts Friday night in a Beantown bout. This rescheduled matchup—originally planned for Jan. 19—saw No. 1 Harvard (6-0, 3-0 Ivy) cruise easily to victory, 9-0, against a rising Division III opponent who, ultimately, proved to be no competition for the Crimson dynasty.
Previously undefeated No. 18 Tufts (12-1) was outmatched by the reigning national champions, ending the Jumbo’s best opening run in past 15 years.
Looking at the game on paper, the meeting between ranked opponents looked to shape up as a close competition between two streaky teams with perfect records. The sheer disparity in skill, however, was apparent between the two teams, as the Crimson swept the field without letting up a game. The team improved its match record to an incredible 56-3.
Harvard took the match against a hot and unfamiliar opponent in stride. No. 1 Alyssa Mehta was given perhaps one of the toughest challenges against freshman Claire Davidson, a strong recruit playing in her first collegiate game. No. 7 Caroline Monrad was the recipient of the only other serious bid by the Jumbos to capture a game, but salvaged her third game, 12-10, against freshman Sahar Tirmizi.
It’s no coincidence that the challenges came from first-year players, as the young Tufts team does not have any seniors on its squad.
“It was a good match,” co-captain Caroline Monrad said. “It was the first time that we got to play their team, so we were pretty excited about it.”
Playing against weaker opponents gave the whole team opportunity to develop. With a 13-woman team, the lower ranked players are often asked to alternate games constrained to a lineup with only nine slots.
“We dropped our top four so that everybody could play could play in the top nine,” Monrad said. “Then we had some of our bottom four play double matches.”
These games against lower ranked teams give more flexibility to the coaches as they set up for the rest of the season. The greater volume of game action for the Crimson’s lesser-ranked players prepares them for tougher opponents by ensuring regular playing time, while pushing their potential as they face higher ranked opponents in low stake matches.
As perennial competitors, the team focuses on a steady progression throughout the season to set them up for success at season’s end. This includes taking advantage of the week off created by the game’s rescheduling.
“This was a pretty light week so the girls actually did some extra cardio and some extra squash to get back in shape because they had a couple days off after that heavy weekend,” said strength and conditioning coach Beth Zeitlin. “So this was good for them to get back on court. It builds confidence when you play well…and we’ve got some big matches coming up ahead of us.”
Head coach Mike Way and the other assistant coaches traveled with the men’s team to Rochester, leaving coach Zeitlin to manage the women’s lower profile game. This turned the night’s focus to sustain the team’s continued dominance.
“When it comes to their on-court stuff I’m really not looking for anything specific,” Zeitlan said. “You know, because I work with them in the gym environment it’s all about injury prevention. I know each athlete so I know who has a back issue, who has a knee issue. So I’m just watching to make sure that they are protecting those issues and that they are staying strong. You know, we’re a first place team so it’s really important that they don’t get injured.”
Harvard’s ability to maintain focus and form throughout, especially without technical guidance from coaches, is telling about how the players have internalized success.
“They had to get a job done today within the civility of the sport without just playing fast,” Zeitlan said. “So they were creating rallies, but they also had to get the job done and win the match.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Friday night, moments after the end of a contest between Harvard women’s basketball and Cornell, Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith exhaled audibly.
Her Harvard team (15-1, 3-0 Ivy), winners of 14 straight before Friday, had entered with a perfect conference record. Over the last forty minutes, the visiting Big Red (11-5, 2-1) had done everything to blemish that mark.
But Friday night at Lavietes Pavilion, Harvard clawed its way to a 62-59 triumph and its 15th consecutive victory.
The spark for the win came off the bench from sophomore guard Sydney Skinner and junior forward Taylor Rooks, who scored 23 and 13 points, respectively. On a night when the usually dependable scoring from freshman Jeannie Boehm and co-captain forward Destiny Nunley was lacking, Rooks and Skinner stepped up when the team needed them most.
“We are all really tired of these close games. We are ready to play Harvard basketball,” Nunley said. “A couple of us were not hitting the shots that we are used to hitting. You could feel that we were upset about our shooting. We felt like we should have turned it on, but thank the Lord that [Sydney] turned it on.”
Skinner shined the brightest going into the final period of play, with Crimson only a field goal ahead of the Big Red. The Plano, TX. native would score 11 of her 23 points in the fourth quarter.
Despite the last quarter heroics, the sophomore also missed a free throw in the final seconds of the contest that would have given Harvard a four-point lead. On the final possession of the game, however, Cornell got a shot off but missed a three to tie the game.
“To be honest this is the type of play we expect from [Skinner],” Coach Delaney-Smith said. “The only thing that surprised me about her play was the one missed foul shot at the end [of the game]. She never misses foul shots.”
Skinner’s ability and willingness to make effort plays showed before the conclusion of the third quarter when she ran the floor to make a LeBron-like block from behind to keep the score tied at 44-44 heading into the final period.
“What is great about her is she’s such an unselfish player. If she sees that someone else has a better opportunity to score, she’ll get them the ball,” Nunley said. “She gives her heart and soul on the court. We always joke around that she hits the floor the hardest. Simply put, we need her.”
Throughout the contest, Cornell’s experience seemed to overwhelm the younger Harvard team. The Big Red started five seniors and prevented Harvard from ever getting into an offensive groove.
There were 10 lead changes over the course of Friday’s matchup. Harvard held the largest lead of the day—a nine-point advantage—in the second quarter.
“There’s such value to experience,” Coach Delaney-Smith said. “I’ve never coached a team that played five seniors at a time, but if I could, I know I would appreciate the value of it.”
For the Big Red, its experience was centered around the play of senior forward Nia Marshall, who earned Ivy League Player of the Week honors after the previous week’s performance against Columbia. Harvard often double-teamed Marshall and forced Cornell’s backcourt to make shots.
“Coaches told us it would take a village to stop her because she is such a great player,” Skinner said. “Their perimeter players were great, but they definitely relied heavily on her.”
Harvard’s defense stepped up to the challenge and limited the senior to 10 points. Boehm, despite scoring an uncharacteristically low 5 points, remained a presence in the paint. She collected 13 boards and blocked three shots. Boehm’s biggest rejection came in the final minute of the game and led to Skinner’s clutch free throw shot.
“We’re so lucky to have [Boehm]. She gives me so much confidence on the court,” Nunley said. “She pulled me aside before the fourth quarter—a freshman pulling senior captain to the side—and [said], ‘ You’re going to take over this game, and we need you.’"

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW YORK, N.Y.—With just over three seconds left on the clock senior guard Siyani Chambers ran the length of the floor and threw up a last second three with Harvard down by three. The basket didn’t fall, however, and the Crimson came just short of coming back from a deficit as large as 19 at one point.
Coming off a matchup where the Crimson rallied late to take a win against Cornell, Saturday’s late effort simply wasn’t enough as Harvard struggled to shoot the ball and sent the Lions to the line early and often.
Despite a strong second half from freshman Seth Towns and sophomore Corey Johnson—who scored 18 in the second half alone—the Crimson’s early struggles were too much to overcome as Harvard (11-6, 3-1 Ivy League) fell to Columbia (9-8, 3-1), 65-62.
TOUGH START
Despite taking an early lead, Harvard struggled to hold back Columbia’s offense late in the first half. Compounded with a barrage of turnovers, the Crimson ended the half down by 15—their largest halftime deficit in a conference game this season.
“Throughout the year we’ve struggled in the first half,” Johnson said. “We always knew we were going to come out in the second half and make a run. We never have doubt in ourselves that we can’t come back in a game.”
In the first frame—and much like it would for the rest of the game—Harvard struggled to find the bottom of the net. Through 20 minutes the Crimson shot just 26 percent from the field and 19 percent from beyond the arc.
Aside from freshman Chris Lewis, no Harvard player converted a field goal more than once in the first half. Sophomore guard Corey Johnson, who finished with a game-high 21 points on 7-of-14 shooting, finished the first half with only three points on 1-of-5 shooting from the field.
To add to the Crimson’s shooting woes, the Lions got their offense going early and kept up the pace late. After being tied at 20, Columbia would go on a 21-6 run to take a dominant lead late in the first. For its part, Harvard struggled to take care of the ball, turning it over five times in the last five minutes of the half and a total of 10 times over the whole frame.
Despite the success of Crimson’s bench over the season, Harvard’s reserves struggled to play the role they’ve played all season. With Columbia coach Jim Engles rotating players early and often, the Lions bench would outscore the Crimson’s 23-10 through the first half.
ROUGH SHOOTING
For Harvard, the shots just didn’t seem to fall on Saturday as the early shooting struggles extended into the rest of the game. In the second frame the Crimson shot 37 percent from the field and 30 percent from three.
On the game, Harvard took a season 39 shots from deep, but only connected on 10 of these with 7 coming courtesy of Johnson. To add to the struggles from behind the arc, the Crimson struggled to get the ball inside—Harvard was outscored 26-12 in the paint and despite sending Columbia to the line for 24 free throws, the Crimson hardly managed to outrebound the Lions.
For its part Columbia forced fouls inside while shooting well from deep. The Lions went 8-of-16 from deep and made it to the line often. Just over eight minutes into the second half Columbia was in the bonus, and despite only shooting 54 percent at the line, outscored Harvard in free throws.
“I wish I could say more about [the foul trouble],” head coach Tommy Amaker said. “Right away it was six to zero with fouls and it sort of put us in a bad spot clearly. They were the aggressor on their end and we weren’t in very good position.”
Chambers, who took the desperation shot to try and tie the game as the buzzer sounded, had an off night on the scoring front. Though the Crimson doesn’t look to Chambers to carry the scoring burden, the senior had just two points in 33 minutes on the floor, both of which came at the charity stripe.
On the game Harvard shot 32 percent from the field and 26 percent from deep.

The Harvard women’s basketball team has become the team to beat in the Ivy League. With Ancient Eight play in full swing it is apparent that the Crimson (16-1, 4-0 Ivy) is getting its opponent's best shot. No matter the scheme or personnel Harvard is a team that refuses to go down. The Columbia Lions (11-6, 1-3 Ivy) threw its best punch, but Harvard again came out on top with a final score of 70 - 68.
“I’m still amazed that these group of people find a way to win,” Coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said.  “You know what, a win's a win, and we have a lot to correct on Monday.”
The Lions had four different players score double digit points to Crimson’s three. Columbia also shot 40 percent from the field, made 86 percent of its free throws, and matched Harvard in the rebound margin. Despite the Lions statistically superior game, the only statistic that would count was the final score.
The Crimson are relieved, but far from satisfied with the late game victory in Lavietes Pavilion.
“We’re pretty disappointed we let them come back because we had a lead,” sophomore guard Madeline Raster said. “We were tough at the end, played good defense and just happy to get the W.”
No one was much happier than Raster at the end of the game as she scored the game winning shot with only 4 seconds left on the clock to give Harvard its 16th straight win. With the win the Crimson stays undefeated in the Ivy League, and continues its historic season spearheaded by a young and spirited squad.
A crucial call in the closing minute gave Columbia the ball, and with the opportunity the Lions ran an inbounds play to perfection. A lob pass to junior forward Camille Zimmerman gave her an easy tip in to tie the score at 68 points with 24 seconds left to go. Coach Delaney-Smith called a timeout and planned for the South Bend native to take the final shot for Harvard.
With eight seconds left Raster drove hard to the lane, stopped on a dime, and sunk the game winner from the free throw line.
“When Murph took that last shot, no doubt in my mind, I knew that was going in,” freshman Jeannie Boehm said.
The Lions, coming off a 4 OT victory over the Dartmouth in Hanover the night before, looked like the well-rested home team in the opening minutes of Saturday night’s Ivy League matchup. Columbia went up by eight in the first quarter and Harvard did not score a bucket until 6 minutes into the contest.
“On offense we are out of sync and rhythm,” Coach Delaney-Smith said. “We have to go back to the drawing board and see what offenses work best, and see how we can best extend the lead.”
Going into the half the Crimson was up 39 - 27, but despite the comfortable lead Harvard was unable to capitalize and earn the dominant lead that has alluded it in Ivy League matchups.
“It was a tough one. I think as a team we need to work on extending our lead. We were up 12 at half,” Boehm said. “I think it says a lot about our heart that we came back and got a win.”
The play and leadership of the underclassmen was undeniable as the young front and backcourt lead the team in scoring. Freshmen Katie Benzan and Boehm both scored 20 points, and Raster scored 18. The 6’3” forward also collected eight rebounds, and blocked three shots in route to another gritty win for Harvard.
The game left many to scratch their heads and wonder what it will take to knock off the Crimson. The Quakers of Penn may prove to have that answer. Coming into the season University of Pennsylvania was predicted to win the Ivy League title, but Harvard has now made itself into a legitimate competitor for that crown.
“In the performance cycle of things you have peaks and plateaus, and I believe we plateaued,” Coach Delaney-Smith said. “I’m hopeful that we are gearing up to take that next step.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In every season there are moments that define a team for better or for worse. For the Harvard men’s squash team, this past weekend has the potential to be one such moment.
After notching victories against the likes of several ranked teams in Dartmouth, Drexel, Penn, Princeton, and Tufts earlier in the season, the undefeated Cambridge squad faced a tough road test in No. 1 Rochester and No. 7 St. Lawrence.
The Crimson (7-0, 3-0 Ivy League) didn’t blink, besting the Yellowjackets (8-2, 0-0 Liberty League Athletic Conference) and the Saints (7-2, 0-0 Liberty League) by identical 6-3 scores.  Looking deeper into the individual matchups, however, it’s clear to see that Harvard saved its most dominant performance for the nation’s top-ranked squad.
“It feels great to have such a strong performance this weekend,” junior David Ryan said “The whole team’s been training hard this year so it's great to see it pay off on the road. It was a long journey to come all the to Rochester and St Lawrence especially after having lost to both these teams for two years running but the determination was clear from the start.”
Facing off at Lyman Squash Center on Saturday in Rochester, N.Y., the Crimson displayed its workmanlike attitude, grinding out tough points against quality opponents with a focused approach. The middle of the ladder is where Harvard showed its prowess, winning each of its matches at the fourth through eighth positions.
At No. 4 spot, freshman Timmy Brownell fought through injury to pull out a back and forth five game victory — 11-9, 10-12, 11-7, 4-11, 11-6. The match was the toughest test so far for the Belmont, Mass. native who had cruised to three set victories in his four previous contests for the Crimson. Brownell remains undefeated in his rookie campaign.
“In the match against Rochester, freshmen Timmy Brownell was our standout performer,” Ryan said. “Even though he suffered from a nasty dead leg in the second game, he rallied back to win in an epic five game thriller, while battling through cramp as well, to clinch the match, 6-3.”
Fellow freshmen Saadeldin Abouaish and Sean Hughes also played respectably in their most important contests for Harvard thus far, as both triumphed in four-set matches that were challenging early on.
Junior Madhav Dhingra and freshman Alexi Gosset also fought in contested matches at their respective positions with Gosset nearly claiming victory after unexpectedly being thrust into the nine-man ladder due to an illness on the squad. Junior Bradley Smith collected the other loss for the Crimson against Rochester senior Mario Yanez Tapia in three games to secure the final result.
Traveling to Canton, N.Y. for the first time since a December 2014 loss, 7-2, Harvard ended a four-match drought against St. Lawrence. The Crimson followed up its triumph over Rochester with another solid performance at the Robie Squash Center.
The Sunday matches were much tighter than those earlier in the weekend, as four contests went the distance. After fighting back from the stomach illness that took him out for the match against Rochester, senior Dylan Murray proved his mettle by pulling out an important momentum swinging victory in one such fitness testing five-gamer at the eighth position. The Crimson won one of the other three hotly contested matches.
Co-captains Bryan Koh and Devin McLaughlin continued their strong play in their ultimate Harvard season, again triumphing over their St. Lawrence opponents 3-1 and 3-0, respectively. The two collectively remain 51-13 in their Crimson careers since the beginning of their sophomore campaigns.
The team’s quality from top-to-bottom continues to shine through as it tallies more and more victories on the season.
“I think the variety and overall quality of players on our team this year has pushed everyone to train harder and smarter,” Ryan said. “The freshmen who came in have lead the charge in the big matches, showing immense maturity and confidence. We've been increasing our fitness everyday and that let's us rely on our shot making skills even more.”
As it heads into another week of Ivy League play, Harvard looks to continue to build off its dominant core of veteran and rookie players.
“This was a huge weekend for the team, and we definitely made a statement to the league about our strength and resiliency,” Brownell said. “It's very tough to play on back-to-back days against rested opponents, but the guys really showed grit and determination against very talented and experienced teams.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There has been a lot research lately into whether or not athletes are becoming better, faster, and stronger. However, the Harvard track team doesn’t need the research. It has Gabby Thomas.
This weekend at the Big Apple Challenge in New York City, the sophomore sprinter did what she has already done so many times—she broke a record. In her 200-meter run, Thomas both set a new indoor track personal record and a Harvard school record in the race. Claiming the third place position with a time of 23.01, the sprint represented the fourth-fastest time for the NCAA this season.
“The competition at this weekend's meet was different because it was a little bit of everything,” Thomas said. “We had the top runners in the country with a mix of teams that I'm used to running in my league, so it was very fun. It was nice to see the Ivy League together competing at a high level, and more importantly, it was such a great opportunity for me to challenge myself and get some practice running against girls of such a high level before I see them again much later in the season.”
The success is nothing new for Thomas. The sophomore phenom started off her career at Harvard with 10 individual victories in the eight-meet outdoor season. She won three times in the 60-meter dash, five times in the 200-meter dash, and twice in the long jump. Thomas also scratched her name into the record books with school and Ivy records in both the 60 and 200-meter dashes. As a result of her success, Thomas was named an All-American for the outdoor season and a First Team All-Ivy in the 60-meter dash.
“This season is different from last year because I'm no longer a rookie and it's weird,” Thomas said. “I'm a sophomore on the team now and a little more adjusted to school and sports. I don't go to meets to see what I can do anymore; I go to meets to get something done. At the Columbia East-West Challenge, I knew that I could set a 200 PR, and that's what I went to do. In a way, this season is a little scarier because of the expectations I have of myself, but now that I know what I am capable of doing, there is so much room for my growth as an athlete.”
The success in her freshman season has clearly spilled over into the current year. With her record-breaking performance last weekend, it seems that the only thing changing for Thomas is that she is getting better. The Florence, Mass. native not only clocked a record-breaking 200, she placed fifth in the 60-meter dash with a time of 7.42 seconds.
The Big Apple Challenge represents an important meet as it not only pitted Thomas against Ivy League rivals Penn, Columbia, and Cornell, but No. 1 Oregon as well.
“I think that competing against great teams from the West Coast give us a taste of what our conference championship will be like,” junior hurdler Jay Herbert said. “Teams like Oregon have some of the best athletes in the country, and racing them is good practice when it comes to mentally preparing ourselves for high levels of competition.”
Thomas has consistently thrived when going toe-to-toe with some of the nation’s top teams. In the first meet of the season, Thomas set a school record in the 300-dash with a time of 38.03 seconds and a second place finish overall. She then proceeded to take gold in the 60-meter dash with a time of 7.55 seconds.
Thomas showed no rust coming back from winter break, taking gold in both the 60-meter and 300-meter dashes at the Beantown Challenge two weekends ago. In both races, Thomas was breathing down the neck of her own records. In the 60-meter, she recorded a time of 7.42 seconds, only .04 seconds off while In the 300, she was .57 seconds shy with a time of 38.6 seconds.
Last weekend at the Rod McCravy Memorial Meet hosted by the University of Kentucky, Thomas recorded the second-fastest Harvard indoor time in the 200-meter dash, good enough for third place at yet another stacked meet. In addition, the 4x400-meter relay team—on which she runs with senior Jade Miller, freshman Karina Joiner, and freshman Zoe Hughes—finished ninth and clocked the fourth-fastest time in school history.
Every race Gabby Thomas runs has the potential to be something special. With her latest record in the 200, Thomas seems to be in prime position to bring home some hardware from the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships in four weeks.
“My biggest challenge will be complacency,” Thomas said. “I don't want to get caught up in the success that I've had in the past, because I know that I still have a long way to go and more goals to accomplish. Last year, it was easy to get better because I was starting from the lowest point in my career. Now, it will be twice as hard to get even just the tiniest bit better.”

Ornithologists around the world are racking their brains trying to understand why it is that Canada Geese have changed their migration patterns so drastically in recent years. The geese have taken a liking to the chilliness of the northeast, and there’s been a notable influx of them on Harvard’s campus. Never mind that we haven’t experienced proper winter weather yet; these geese are roaming the campus in swarms, no doubt burning up under their many feathers.
Yes, the geese we’re talking about aren’t the grayish-brown bodied, black-necked, winged ones that roam the wild, but rather the black, chunky, wearable kind—Canada Goose jackets that exist in the vast wilderness of your local Saks, Bloomies, or Neiman Marcus stores for a “reasonable” price of about $1000.
We’re just as baffled as anyone else by the popularity of these jackets on campus. Sure, we’ve all given in to some pretty basic fashion trends (we’re still pretty attached to North Face jackets and Uggs, tbh), but no fad is compelling enough for us to drop “ten hunnas” on a plain black jacket with a small red symbol on the sleeve. Even if we did have that sort of liquid cash on us, there are much better things to buy: 8 of Mankiw’s textbooks, 59 Annenberg guest passes, or three nice, warm, and distinctly-designed Patagonias.
Still, we decided to give the Goose a try because we thought there might be a reason for all the hype. We stopped by Beyond on Brattle Street, and upon entering, were stunned by the pristine array of Geese on the racks. It led us to wonder who the target audience is for a store that essentially only sells this one exorbitant jacket brand. Just Harvard students in the 1 percent? Anyone else wish we had a Target or Old Navy instead, for the other 99?
Anyway, we hesitantly tried some black fur-length coats and were instantly displeased. 
We felt stifled. Our creative expression robbed. Our individuality smothered. And then, we felt emotional. We wondered why people would subject themselves to such a criminally bland wardrobe choice, or why they would wear a coat purporting to be a “Canada Goose” that is lacking in any obvious goose-based insignia. Over a year later, we’re still convinced something fishy is going on with this brand. Is Canada engineering a global takeover? Should we run—full speed—from folks donning these coats?
Believe it or not, we have friends at Harvard who own Canada Goose coats, and we definitely make an effort to ensure that this doesn't drive a wedge between us. After all, at the end of the day, de gustibus non est disputandum. To each their own.
Still, we recommend you keep an eye on them. Maybe even two.

In case you missed it, everyone’s favorite freshman dining hall at Harvard got an upgrade over winter break. We came back to an Annenberg with red-painted walls (very crimson, nice) and tasteful framed pictures of… vegetables.
The plates are the same scratched ones we know and love, but the serving utensils and dishes are all shiny and new. We are seriously considering the idea that the Berg's food tastes better now that it comes in different containers. Here’s a definitive list of foods that have improved and foods that haven’t since the Berg got a new look:
Coffee and Hot Chocolate
In a groundbreaking move for every caffeine-addicted freshman, the coffee mugs are newer and bigger. That is, they’re not stained (yet) and they’re finally, almost the size of average coffee mugs. Say goodbye to getting five refills to sate your sleep-deprived body—now you’re only going to need two.
Sweet Potato Fries
We’re very vocal about our love for arguably the best item on the HUDS menu, and we doubt there’s any way to improve this d-hall classic. But we are deeply sorry to report that the tongs used to serve the fries, while new, are still kind of lame. You know that feeling when you’re trying to load up on sweet potato fries but the tongs are only picking up two fries at a time, and you’re holding up the line, and you’re breaking out in sweat and...well, be prepared. You’re going to get those feelings a lot.
Oatmeal Toppings
Fitness-conscious folks will be super pleased to see the cute little jars we have for oatmeal toppings. Now when you come back sweaty from your morning run you can feel even more smug about your hipster lifestyle and good choices!
Scrambled Eggs
The scrambled eggs now come in enormous steel bowls/basins. It may look better, but now our eggs are now even more clumpy than before—more like a solid egg mass than proper scrambled eggs. Unfortunately, it is even more difficult to scoop out a good portion for your post-lift protein needs. Well, at least eggs are eggs. They still taste good(ish).
We all have a love-hate relationship with the Berg, but we have to admit that we like the new look. The red accents are pretty damn snazzy. As for the food? The jury’s still out on that.
