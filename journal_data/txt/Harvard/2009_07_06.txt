After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
TEL AVIV, Israel – Every so often, there’s an article—most frequently, to confirm the collegiate stereotype, in The New York Times—that everyone’s been talking about and that I, as usual, have missed. But on the flight from Newark to Tel Aviv, when the attendant passed through the aisle offering up a selection of newspapers to suit any American political orientation—Ha’aretz for the liberals, The Jerusalem Post for the conservatives, or the Times for those who didn’t know the difference between one and the other—I stumbled upon what has proven to be, in Israel at least, the buzz article of the month.
I’m referring to Tony Judt’s “Fictions on the Ground,” in which Judt, the director of NYU’s Remarque Institute for European Studies, condemns Israel’s continued construction of settlements in the Palestinian territories. He even urges President Barack H. Obama to “remind Israelis that all their settlements are hostage to American goodwill.” Some have labeled Judt’s piece, perhaps appropriately, as anti-Zionist: yet another media big-name railing against the State of Israel. But given the tone Obama set in his Cairo Speech, Judt’s ideas, for better or for worse, are emblematic—if not the most accurate articulation—of this administration’s attitude toward Israel. 
With Judt’s piece in mind—and in light of Obama’s recent call for all settlement activity to freeze—the Israeli government’s June 29 announcement to build yet another 50 homes in a West Bank settlement north of Jerusalem (which, according to Ha’aretz, could likely grow into as many as 1,450) only serves to highlight just how contentious “the settlement issue” has become between Israel and its closest ally-cum-benefactor. 
Almost, it seems, in response to the outrage in Obama’s America over continued settlement expansion—of which “Fictions on the Ground” is perhaps the most vehement condemnation—the Israeli government appears to be making some concessions. But, the problem is that Israel’s concessions on settlement expansion seem thus far to be little more than necessary measures to appease the United States.  Like the obligatory discussions between rebellious child and frustrated parent, these actions satisfy for the moment, but ultimately just postpone the issue. 
Earlier this week, for instance, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak flew to New York to meet with US Mideast Envoy George Mitchell. After the conference, Barak told Israel Radio that he and Mitchell “focused mainly on the need for a comprehensive regional agreement,” and, later, according to The Jerusalem Post, that no Americans really think that “we can stop pregnancies or not build kindergartens where required.” Well, fine. That makes sense enough for the time being. But what happens in 5 years? In 10? In 50? As Ha’aretz’s projection of 50 new settlement homes potentially turning into 1,450 suggests, Barak’s use of the nebulous term “where required” is a dangerous loose end, one that only serves to complicate the issue rather than coming anywhere close to solving it. 
Settlements, like all cities, experience population growth and the consequent need for civic resources like the kindergartens Barak mentions—that’s hardly the issue at hand. Continued rapid expansion is. And the U.S. should not accept hazy promises that could prolong a rapid rate of Israeli settlement expansion, perhaps the largest current impediment to peace between Israel and its neighbors. It’s one thing for the U.S. to deny in word alone the carte blanche that Israel enjoyed during the Bush administration, and another to take some sort of action. With regard to the settlement “freeze,” Washington would be wise to demand a clear, concrete delineation, lest, in Judt’s words, it be “played yet again for a patsy.”

NEW YORK, N.Y. — In Red Hook, Brooklyn, where crumbling warehouses butt up against a shiny new Ikea, summer weekends mean huaraches and hipsters. Every Saturday and Sunday, a band of pan-Latin food carts flank the edges of the neighborhood soccer fields, serving dishes like the Mexican cornmeal huarache, and bringing with them a crowd eager for gustatory experience. 
Carts have come to the fields for decades, providing refreshments for the amateur athletes, but it wasn’t until the last few years that the mix of cornmeal and ground meat became destination dining. Food blogs hail the carts as some of the city’s best and the name “Red Hook Ball Fields” is now synonymous with street food delicacy. The carts have taken their place among New York’s ethnic cuisine elite—when the city threatened not to renew the vendors’ permit in 2007, dedicated eaters, including Senator Chuck Schumer, rallied for their survival.
I arrived at the fields last Saturday at noon and lines were already forming for a cart selling pupusas, a flat Salvadorian bread made with maize and stuffed with cheese, pork, or beans. Each pupusa comes with a serving of pickled cabbage. The sharpness of the vinegar cuts the grease of the bread—or so thought the man in front of me. As patron after patron received their plastic dish, he would point and nod at his girlfriend. “A pupusa—A Salvadorian pupusa.”
On the fields, men in red and green jerseys played soccer. Families watched and cheered from the picnic tables. A few steps over, a group of 20-somethings stood in a clump, arms crossed. “This is great,” said one. “Yeah, this is pretty great.” Behind them, a sign draped over a fence. “Welcome to Red Hook. Bienvenidos a Red Hook.”Madeleine M. Schwartz ’12 is a Crimson arts writer in Kirkland House.

BEIJING, China — Like everything else in life, heat is great, in moderation. At Bethel Foster Home in rural Beijing, where I am volunteering as a piano teacher and resident translator for blind or visually impaired orphans, it was 41 degrees Celcius today. That’s 105.8 degrees Fahrenheit, for you Americans. Hotter than body temperature, way into fever, and way, way past moderation. Let me describe some simple ways that heat manifests itself.
•Thanks to sweat, underwear sticks to skin like glue. Note the third person—helping cute toddlers position themselves on the toilet just got twice as awkward.
•Even sitting still is susceptible to intense sweating. The kids love to hug and hold hands. You can imagine the result of this touchy-feely behavior.
•The red bean ice cream bars I bought for the volunteers melted on the bike ride back from the store. Oh well, still (nearly) as yummy!
•Heat sucks both physical energy and brainpower. In today’s social competency class, all the students were occupied with fanning themselves and wiping sweat. “Pan Pan, is it a good idea to hit someone back if they hit you first?” I translated in Chinese. “Yes,” came the drowsy reply...
•My legs stick to any surface—the piano bench, wooden chairs, leather couch—and, when lifted, make this noise between a smack and whoosh. The locals don’t experience this, as they wear light cotton pants and no one seems to wear jeans or shorts around here.
•Heat is to flies as alcohol is to man. Today, there were at least 20 flies in the office, all swirling lazily and crookedly. And since I’m covered with sweat, these flies would boldly venture near my ear or nose, unafraid of being swatted. Actually, the fly swatter is currently broken from overuse.
But, body temperature aside, Bethel Foster Home, with its delicious and authentic (unlike Annenberg) Chinese cooking, daily music and prayers, and the bonds that I've formed with the friendly and intelligent kids, has made all that sweat worthwhile.

CAIRO, Egypt — Being roused from your bed by the Egyptian Ministry of Health at 2 a.m. can never portend good things. I had my temperature and throat cultures taken before I drowsily fell back asleep.  But unfortunately for me, the masked officials took more than that: They took my freedom.  For the next week, I was quarantined inside an American University in Cairo’s dormitory due to a small outbreak of swine flu among the U.S. law students living here (figures).  
It wasn’t really so bad.  Our dormitory has a small courtyard so we could get some sunlight and fresh air.  We organized daily activities like yoga, dinner on the rooftop, and a soccer tournament to keep things lively.  But daily I would mope for a bit by my window facing the street, once making eye contact with some passersby and gleefully chatting with them using only gestures, until one of the policemen, who stand on every corner with AK 47s, yelled at us to stop.  Evidently I might have passed the swine flu just by grinning at them.
But I understand why Egypt decided to pen us up.  While their actions may seem extreme given that, at the time I was quarantined, infected Harvard students were attending graduation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended staying at home and resting as the flu’s best treatment, Egypt is in an entirely different situation.  Very few people have health coverage, most do not get ideal nutrition, and proper hygiene as we think of it is simply non-existent–our dorm didn’t have soap in the bathrooms until the quarantine.   Avian flu caused hundreds of deaths here, and so officials are right to be concerned about the impact swine flu could have on the poorer population.  
I just hope I’m not in town for the next outbreak.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WASHINGTON, D.C. — The Washington Nationals were counting on a match made in heaven when they picked Stephen Strasburg first overall in this year’s Major League Baseball amateur draft. On the surface, it was a no-brainer. Strasburg, who went 13-1 with a 1.32 ERA in his final season with San Diego State, was unanimously agreed to be the best player available; some experts even called the 20-year-old starter “the best pitching prospect ever.” By draft day, it was unthinkable that the first-picking Nats would choose anyone else.
But they should have. And, now—since they did pick Strasburg—the Nationals should refuse the demands of his agent, the nefarious Scott Boras, for a record-shattering contract—even if it means losing out on the kid who once struck out 23 batters in a game.
First, there’s simply no such thing as a can’t-miss prospect. Injuries have dampened the statistics of many first overall picks before Strasburg—especially pitchers—either by limiting their playing time or by limiting their abilities. For example, 2001 second pick Mark Prior, the previous best pitching prospect ever and benefactor of the current record contract ($10.5 million), hasn’t played in a game since 2006. And 1997’s first pick, Matt Anderson, learned the hard way that a 100-mile-per-hour fastball is suddenly below average after losing your arm strength to a single injury.
Baseball pundits have also raised the possibility that Strasburg may someday throw the fastest fastball ever pitched. But this is even more cause for concern: Pitchers, especially young ones, can abuse their (developing) bodies by throwing unnaturally hard. Of the four pitchers who have been recorded at 103 miles per hour, three have had career-altering injuries. The fourth is Stephen Strasburg. There’s no question that the wunderkind is talented today—but such extreme talent at such a young age should be considered a red flag, not a boon.
The best reason to take a stand against Strasburg, though, is money’s egregious influence in baseball. Superagent Boras is responsible for some of the largest contracts in the history of the game, many of which smell suspiciously of price gauging. Now that the Nationals have secured the right to sign Strasburg, Boras is reportedly demanding a $50 million contract for his young client. This ridiculous sum is simply not the fair market value for a pitcher who has never played an inning of pro ball. Moreover, teams pass the cost of such inflated contracts along to the fans in the form of increasingly unaffordable ticket prices. Because Strasburg’s career remains largely uncertain, the Nationals can afford to—indeed, should seize the opportunity to—refuse to cut a  deal with a greedy culture that has bullied baseball into fiscal irresponsibility.
However, it’s all but certain that the Nationals will pay whatever it takes to sign Strasburg—they’re under considerable political pressure to do so. The team was criticized for striking out with last year’s top pick, Aaron Crow. Most importantly, though, the Nationals, at an MLB-worst 24-55 as of July 5, desperately need help winning. Too bad one player can never turn a franchise around—especially one who only plays every fifth day. 
We can only hope that the Nationals manage to put political considerations aside—that they’ll resist the lobbying of Scott Boras, that they’ll make a smart decision based on history and facts, and that they’ll do what is right rather than what is popular. 
Then again… This is Washington. Nathaniel S. Rakich ’10, a Crimson editorial editor, is a government concentrator in Cabot House. He would be OK with it if the Nationals decided to draft him next year.
