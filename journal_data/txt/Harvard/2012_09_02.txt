After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite a slow start and a second half featuring several yellow cards and injuries, the Harvard field hockey team pulled off a victory in its season opener, defeating Holy Cross, 1-0, in front of sizeable crowd at Jordan Field on Saturday afternoon.
With under 10 minutes remaining in the contest, the Crusaders (0-2) pressured the Crimson defense, as Holy Cross forward Carly Grimaudo drove up the right side. Deking a few defenders and getting past Harvard goalie and co-captain Cynthia Tassopoulos, she faced an open net. But co-captain Kim Goh made a game-changing defensive save, turning the momentum in favor of the home team.
Less than two minutes later, sophomore Catriona McDonald converted a penalty-corner chance for the Crimson (1-0) by deflecting a pass from sophomore Caitlin Rea into the top right corner of the net.
One goal proved to be enough for Harvard, as Tassopoulos contributed four saves in net, giving Crimson coach Tjerk van Herwaarden his first victory at Harvard.
“This was a little bit more drama than we normally expect in a game, with a couple cards and injuries,” Goh said.  “But I’m proud to see we came out with enough heart to win it.”
The victory made it five straight season-opening wins against the Crusaders and improved the Crimson’s all-time record on opening day to 26-11-2.
“I think we started really well,” van Herwaarden said. “We played like we meant to play. I think our technical plan was performed really well.”
In the second half, sophomores Kaitlyn Boudah, who also sang the national anthem before the game, and Noel Painter, last year’s leading goalscorer for Harvard, were both assessed yellow cards, and Rea, among others, suffered an injury.
“With some injuries and people going off the field, it was very difficult to find organization,” van Herwaarden said. “But with everything that happened in the game, the injuries, the cards, to take the win—I think it’s a step in the right direction.”
The first half proved fairly uneventful, as Holy Cross outshot Harvard, 3-2, and tallied four penalty corners to the Crimson’s two. Tassopoulos made a diving save shortly before the half expired, keeping the visitors from taking the lead before the break.
“Today, as a goalkeeper and as a captain, [Tassopoulos] led by example and made sure this team could cheer even after just one goal,” van Herwaarden said.
Harvard's pressure increased early in the second half as the offense pushed more through the Crusaders' zone.
Eleven minutes into the frame, Rea fired a low, hard shot from center toward the left side of the net, but Holy Cross goalie Kat Matchett came up with the diving save. Sophomore Sydney Jenkins also had a scoring opportunity two minutes later, but her shot rolled wide of the net.
The Crusaders regrouped after a timeout, containing the Crimson offense until Goh’s dramatic defensive save, which proved to be a turning point.
“We had a lot of opportunities,” Goh said. “And from opportunities, one will go in, and that’s all it takes. We got the one, and hopefully we’ll have a little bit more of a buffer in future games.”
A packed Jordan Field contributed to a home-field advantage for Harvard as well, with many new freshmen in attendance for one of the first athletic contests of the fall season.
“The crowd helped a lot just getting momentum,” Goh said. “You can sort of feel not just on the field but off the field, everyone’s pushing you forward. And all of sudden the ball’s in the net; that’s sort of the way things work. You ride the wave."
Van Herwaarden believes this a step in the right direction as the Crimson looks to build its momentum before entering Ivy League play in couple weeks.
“We have had some changes in the last couple of weeks, and this is a step in our progress,” he said. “We have practice tomorrow and Sacred Heart on Monday, so we have to make sure we are able to push through a little bit quicker and make sure we can keep playing with organization [to] win the next game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Northeastern senior midfielder Dante Marini tore through the Harvard defense on run after run. Marini, listed at 5’3”, and fellow senior Don Anding left the Crimson defenders gassed and created scoring chances all afternoon as the Huskies defeated Harvard, 1-0, in front of a capacity crowd Sunday at Northeastern.
Crimson freshman goalie Evan Mendez provided a solid performance, saving five shots and commanding the defense as it attempted to reel the Huskies duo in. But one slip up halfway through the second half proved to be the difference as Northeastern (3-0-0) extended its three-game winning streak. Off a change of possession, Anding took off down the left side of the field, before cutting back in and firing a quick shot on target.
Mendez got his hands on it but wasn’t able to maintain control as the ball dribbled away and into no-man’s land in front of an open goal. Northeastern sophomore Donovan Fayd’Herbe de Maudave won the race to the ball and put it in the back of the net, breaking a deadlock in the back-and-forth affair.
“I’m obviously disappointed that we lost,” Mendez said. “We had the upper hand in some parts of the game, and they had the upper hand in some others, so there’s definitely some stuff to work on.”
Though the Huskies dominated possession, the Crimson (0-1-1) was not suffering from a lack of chances. Just 28 minutes into the game, junior striker Connor McCarthy tore down the right wing before crossing in to classmate Kevin Harrington. Harrington had a shot at goal but his attempt sailed over the net, a problem that plagued many of Harvard’s attackers.
McCarthy, who also runs track, provided the most spark offensively for the Crimson, routinely outrunning defenders and getting the ball into scoring position.
But Northeastern proved to be the better side on the pitch Sunday. Egged on by a rowdy student section, the Huskies built up pressure to the point that a goal seemed to be only a matter of time. Though Mendez and towering senior defender Richard Smith shored up the defense and stopped Northeastern from capitalizing on a number of chances, the Huskies eventually broke through, taking the lead and never looking back.
“I think our game-day approach could be better,” Harvard coach Carl Junot said. “If we execute our system, we’ll be all right. It’s more about execution than strategy.”
The Crimson, which has been plagued by a lack of offense in recent years, may be in dire need of someone to step up. Sophomore striker Hiroki Kobayashi—the season’s lone goalscorer—went down just six minutes into the game after a vicious tackle by a Huskies defender. He hopes to be ready for action next week. Freshman Jake Freeman played in his stead.
“There was a tough tackle early in the game,” Junot said. “It wasn’t necessarily a dirty tackle, but I don’t think the intent was good either.”
Referee Bahij Salman kept control of a game that showed the potential of getting out of hand a number of times. In a two-minute span between the 67th and 69th minutes, three yellow cards were handed out: to sophomore Tyler Evans, to Northeastern defender Tyler Blum, and the final one to the entire Huskies’ bench.
Despite the setback and the day’s loss, Kobayashi seemed optimistic moving forward.
“Ever since the end of last season, we’ve been really excited for this season to start, and I think we’ve been playing well and just need to keep working hard to improve,” Kobayashi said.
A number of other mainstays from last season were left out of the lineup as well. Junior A.J. Agha, who tied for the team lead in goals last season, is recovering from a knee injury and will most likely sit out the remainder of the fall season.
Seniors Zach Wolfenzon and Brian Rogers were also out due to injury. Returning points leader Ross Friedman and senior Brett Conrad were left off the gameday roster.
The home opener comes against Michigan State (2-1-2) at 4 pm on Sep. 7. Harvard has won five straight home openers, and will look to extend that streak against a tough Spartans team from the Big Ten.
