After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The members of the newly established governing board of the University library system announced Monday that Helen Shenton, current deputy director of the Harvard University Library and former member of the leadership team of the British Library, will serve as the first Harvard Library executive director.
In her new capacity on the Harvard Library Board, Shenton will lead an ongoing centralization effort to facilitate greater coordination among the University’s traditionally autonomous school libraries.
Shenton came to Harvard this past fall after serving as head of collection care for the British Library, one of the largest research libraries in the world.
“Helen believes strongly, as do I, that academic libraries must not only collect and preserve materials and offer expert guidance to students and faculty alike, but must also be engines of innovation in this exciting time of change,” Provost Steven E. Hyman said in a statement to the Harvard Gazette.
As deputy director of HUL, Shenton served as a member of the Library Implementation Work Group, which acted upon the proposals submitted in Nov. 2009 by the Task Force on University Libraries.
Shenton will now look to coordinate the 73 library units within the Harvard library system, the world’s largest University library system.
The current system affords each school autonomy over its individual collection, resulting in a lack of a cohesive structure across the entire library system, according to Chair of the Harvard Library Implementation Work Group David C. Lamberth, a professor at the Divinity School.
The establishment of the Harvard Library Board was the first major overhaul in what Lamberth described as a long-term process to coordinate the disparate library units.
The members of the eleven-person board, named Dec. 10 by University President Drew G. Faust, are professors and administrators from throughout the University.
The board selected Shenton in its first official meeting. She could not be reached for comment for this article.
“I am honored to accept this role at a transformative time for the world’s greatest university library,” Shenton told the Gazette.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Updated 1:29 p.m.
A man who authorities said confessed to robbing the Harvard University Employees Credit Union in October was arrested Monday morning as he approached another Cambridge bank while under police surveillance.
Paul Gowell, 53, of Wakefield, Mass., was arrested for the attempted robbery of the Cambridge Trust Bank in Porter Square. He was also charged with robbing the East Cambridge Savings Bank on Dec. 3 and the HUECU on Oct. 30.
At approximately 10:30 a.m. on Monday, the Cambridge Police Department received a tip from the FBI Bank Robbery Task Force, which had been following Gowell in the Porter Square area of Cambridge, according to a police report. The police and the task force then collaborated to set up surveillance of the area in order to observe Gowell.
According to the police report, Gowell, who was wearing a baseball hat, a black hooded sweatshirt, and black gloves, parked his car on Hurlbut Street and then headed towards the Porter Square location of the Cambridge Trust Bank, located on Mass. Ave.
"There was information that led the Bank Robbery Task Force to believe that he was going to go rob that bank," said Daniel M. Riviello, the spokesman for the CPD. "So the police officers went into the bank ahead of time and told them to lock the doors, so even if he got the bank, he wouldn’t have been able to get in."
Two officers were inside the bank at the time and watched as the suspect approached, according to the report. When exiting the bank, the officers saw Gowell draw a white handkerchief from his pocket and cover the bottom half of his face with it.
"He left his car and began approaching the bank and started to put a handkerchief over his face as if he were going to go in and rob the bank," Riviello said. "At that time members of the Cambridge police and the Bank Robbery Task Force apprehended him before he get into the bank."
Police proceeded to arrest Gowell, who admitted under interrogation that he had robbed two other banks—the East Cambridge Savings Bank and the HUECU—earlier this year, according to the CPD report.
The HUECU has been robbed twice over the past 13 months. Police have not yet captured the person responsible for the previous robbery, which took place on Dec. 2, 2009.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the Connecticut women’s basketball team broke the NCAA Division I record last night with its 89th consecutive victory, the Harvard men’s basketball squad is looking to make national headlines of its own by upsetting the Huskies’ male counterparts on the same court one evening later.
Doing so will require a team effort of a magnitude never before seen in Crimson basketball history, as taking down No. 4 UConn (9-0)–the highest-ranked team Harvard has faced in 19 years–will be quite the tall order.
But that’s not to say it’s not achievable. Last season, the Crimson (7-2) hung with the then-No. 14 Huskies, who had to survive a late run to hold off Harvard 79-73 in Storrs.
“[We learned last year] that we have the ability to play with them,” junior co-captain Oliver McNally said. “We have to come in with the intent to try to win the game, not just to play well.”
Though the Crimson nearly pulled off the upset in 2009, that game was largely a one-man show that turned into Jeremy Lin ‘10’s coming-out party. The senior dominated the Husky defense, scoring 30 points, throwing down two dunks, and becoming a nationally-recognized sensation in the process.
This season, knocking off Connecticut without Lin–now a Golden State Warrior–will require contributions from every Harvard player on both sides of the court.
Offensively, the Crimson will need two of its top shooters–freshman Laurent Rivard and sophomore Christian Webster–to be on from long distance.
The team often lives and dies with the three against superior competition and at times has struggled from downtown in front of large crowds on the road.
In the squad’s first loss this year, both Rivard and Webster–the team’s leading scorer at 16.6 points per game–struggled from three-point land at George Mason, and the team lost by 13. In its other defeat, at Michigan earlier in the month, Webster again was off, but Rivard was on from behind the arc. The Crimson lost by just three to the Wolverines.
If one or both does not have his shot early in the game, McNally and sophomore Brandyn Curry will need to step-up their perimeter scoring in front of the likely 10,000-plus person crowd at the XL Center.
“We’re just trying to stay sharp and execute well in practice [this week], which will generally carry over to the game,” McNally said.
The team will also need continued strong production inside from McNally’s co-captain Keith Wright, both in the paint and on the glass. Wright has averaged 15.7 points and 8.8 rebounds per contest this season, but will have the tough task of going up against UConn sophomore center Alex Oriakhi tonight. Oriakhi averages a double-double with 11.4 points and 10.0 rebounds for a Husky team that ranks fourth in the country in rebounding.
Wright will receive help on the boards from sophomore forward Kyle Casey and junior Andrew Van Nest. Casey has been hampered by illness and a foot injury that has prevented him from seeing major minutes in any of the team’s last three contests.
For Harvard to pull off the upset, Casey–who has averaged just 4.4 points and 3.2 rebounds in limited action this season–will have to look like the player who was a preseason First Team All-Ivy selection.
The Crimson has had 11 days to prepare for the Huskies since its last game, a 16-point win over Boston University, giving Casey and his teammates the chance to get healthy.
“We’re definitely well rested, so I think that can help us,” Webster said.
The break also provided Curry extra time to prepare to defend UConn guard Kemba Walker, who has emerged as one of the country’s elite players this season.
The junior guard–who scored 20 points against Harvard last year–has led a UConn teamthat started the season unranked to victories over top-10 squads Michigan State and
Kentucky. Walker is second in the nation with 27.2 points per game and also leads the Huskies with 4.0 assists and 2.3 steals per contest.
“Obviously we’re going to pay a lot of attention to him; he’s one of the best players in the country,” McNally said. “I think we’ll try a bunch of different guys on him, [but] we have confidence in Brandyn to put pressure on the ball and try to make him take tough shots.”
After Walker and Oriakhi, the Huskies get scoring from freshman guards Shabazz Napier and Jeremy Lamb, who average 8.6 and 7.6 points per contest respectively.
Despite the Huskies’ ranking and undefeated record, they have been challenged twice by mid-majors this year, only beating Wichita State by four and New Hampshire by seven.
With a big road contest next Monday at No. 6 Pitt, UConn will have to avoid falling prey to the traditional “trap” game against the Crimson. But coming off its seventh win in eight games, Harvard is confident in its own ability to shock the basketball world either way.
“We’re just going to try to play the game we’ve been playing–move the ball, be unselfish, and play inside out,” Webster said. “[If we do that], I feel like we have a good shot at knocking them off.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
HARTFORD, CONN.–The Harvard men’s basketball team traveled to Connecticut with hopes of handing the No. 4 Huskies their first defeat of the season. But after last night’s 81-52 loss in front of 11,255 at the XL Center, the Crimson (7-3) will return to Cambridge having suffered the same fate as each of UConn’s nine previous opponents.
Using their superior strength and athleticism, the Huskies (10-0) grabbed a commanding lead early in the contest and cruised to the 29-point victory—their second largest of the season.
Capitalizing on Harvard’s early offensive struggles, UConn jumped out to a 21-6 advantage and then saw its lead balloon to as much as 27 by the end of the first half, effectively sealing the victory.
“They’re a really outstanding basketball team,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “They are a very talented team, but they play really well together.” After an 11-day layoff for exam period, Harvard turned in its worst offensive output of the season, shooting a season-low 30 percent from the field while coughing up 17 turnovers.
The Crimson struggled from beyond the arc in particular, connecting on just 4-of-31 attempts from deep.
“Our ability to make an open shot to loosen things up wasn’t there,” Amaker said. “They make you work so hard to get open, to make a pass, to feed the post. Their quickness on the perimeter was outstanding, so they put a lot of pressure on our perimeter shots.”
Junior co-captain Keith Wright led Harvard’s offense with 18 points, scoring off a variety of post moves on 8-of-12 shooting.
But the Huskies talented frontcourt, led by 6'9" Alex Oriakhi and 7'0" Charles Okwandu made it difficult for the Crimson to run its offense through the post in the opening minutes. Wright didn’t score his first basket until more than eight minutes had elapsed in the game.
“They’re so long, and their timing and shot blocking was tremendous,” Amaker said of the UConn frontcourt. “Certainly I thought that affected us.”
Sophomore Christian Webster—who entered the contest as Harvard’s leading scorer, averaging 16.6 points per game—struggled to find his stroke, finishing with two points on 0-of-9 shooting from the floor.
“I think we did a really good job on [Webster],” said Oriakhi, who anchored the Huskies with 10 points and nine rebounds. “When your leading scorer doesn’t really get it going, I think it’s hard for a team to get going offensively.”
But Webster wasn’t the only Crimson player who struggled to connect from the floor, as Harvard missed its first 12 shots and its first 10 three-point attempts.
The Huskies capitalized on the Crimson’s early struggles, rattling off an 11-0 run to start the game.
UConn guard Kemba Walker—arguably the nation’s top player—sparked the run, finishing a tough layup over Harvard sophomore Brandyn Curry two minutes into the contest for the first of his game-high 20 points on the evening.
After misses from Wright and Webster and a turnover from Curry, rookie Niels Giffey found Okwandu open under the basket for the easy two to put the home squad up 4-0. Two minutes later, Okwandu struck again, this time sticking a short jumper.
A Webster travel on the Crimson’s ensuing possession returned the ball to the Huskies, who put the ball in the hands of freshman Shabazz Napier. The 6’0” guard attacked the hoop and finished the basket despite being fouled.
With the ensuing free throw, UConn took the 9-0 lead with 14:24 left to play.
Coming off the bench, freshman Laurent Rivard attempted to jumpstart Harvard’s dormant offense, but his first three-point attempt was off its mark. Freshman Ugo Okam pulled down the offensive rebound, but the seven-footer was unable to convert the put-back layup.
The Huskies sank a jumper on their next possession, forcing Amaker to burn a 30-second timeout with the Crimson down 11-0 six minutes into the contest.
Rivard ended the scoring drought with two free throws out of the break, but the squad’s offensive woes continued.
“I thought we came out just not ready,” sophomore Oliver McNally said. “I think we were a little scared. I don’t think we were ready.”
Coming off the bench, sophomore Kyle Casey gave Harvard some much-needed energy, coming up with a steal at midcourt and throwing down a thunderous dunk to bring the Crimson back within nine, 15-6. But Harvard experienced another offensive drought following Casey’s slam, and the Huskies went on a 15-2 run, led by five points from Walker to establish a 30-8 lead with 5:49 left in the half.
“Offensively, we were an absolute mess,” McNally said.
After going into the break down by 27, the Crimson managed to cut the lead to 19 midway through the second period, thanks to buckets from Wright and Rivard, but UConn built its lead back up to 25 within minutes.
“I thought our kids were really frustrated with not being able to make some shots,” Amaker said. “Sometimes that happens where [missing shots] zaps your energy on defense, and I thought that Connecticut took advantage of every mishap we had and did a tremendous job [yesterday] evening.”
