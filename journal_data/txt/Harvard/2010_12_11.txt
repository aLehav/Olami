After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
William A. Grace ’12, the director of the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club production of “Romeo & Juliet,” does not lay his scene in gentle Verona; instead it is set in a playground. A rope bridge is stretched along the center of the stage. Ladders and stairs connect one platform to another. While the teenage Juliet (Rebecca E. Feinberg ’13) swings gleefully on one of two swings which dangle stage-right, her older suitor, Paris (Felix L. Cook ’13) sits with his back ramrod straight.
In this rendition of Shakespeare’s tragedy, which runs in the Loeb Experimental Theater from December 3-5 and again from December 8-11, Romeo and Juliet are shown for what they are: teenagers who are closer to childhood than adulthood and have more passion than they can handle. Juliet gets married in a white sundress and black Converse. Romeo (Philip M. Gillen ’13) ties a string around Juliet’s finger in place of a wedding band.  Benvolio (Nasir W. Husain ’12) perpetually wears skinny jeans and his lover, Mercutio (Alexander P. Raymond ’12) plays the ukulele. The allusions to the hipster aesthetic, also present in Grace’s superb sound design, provide a compelling modern twist on the story.
Though occasionally style threatens to overwhelm substance, Grace’s production succeeds in depicting the naïveté of the lovers without undermining the depth of their passions. When the staging ties in with the themes of the performance, which is more often than not, the effect is dazzling. With each death, glaring, unforgiving white fluorescent lights are activated. Though Grace’s production may emphasize the youthful hope of the lovers, it does not sugarcoat the tragic consequences of their love. In a beautiful moment of juxtaposition, an ebullient Juliet waits on the balcony for her groom, as Romeo sits huddled in Friar Lawrence’s cell and Benvolio scrubs Mercutio’s blood from the floor.
The production is somewhat abridged, most notably leaving out the opening fight scene between the Capulets and the Montagues, which sets up the dynamic between the warring families. This abridgement leaves room for Grace to supplement the text with contemplative, silent scenes, which help establish the relationships between the characters. Nonethelss, this brevity comes at a cost. Without the first fight scene, the integral fight between Tybalt (Matthew J. DaSilva ’12) and Mercutio feels almost arbitrary. In many productions, Tybalt and Mercutio are vivid and over-the-top, energetic counterparts to the otherwise straight-laced cast of characters. Raymond’s Mercutio is woefully understated, failing to realize the mesmerizing effect of the notorious Queen Mab monologue. As for DaSilva’s Tybalt, he seems to die as quickly as he appears.
Fortunately, this does not significantly detract from the rest of the performance or from Raymond’s believable chemistry with Husain. Grace’s interpretation of Mercutio and Benvolio as gay lovers may at first seem like an arbitrary choice to enliven the story.  However, it updates the classic in a believable fashion and the parallel between the two couples adds a novel dimension to the story. Reinterpreting Mercutio and Benvolio as lovers also changes the latter’s characterization. In most productions of “Romeo and Juliet”, Benvolio serves as the straight man to the lovelorn Romeo and the theatrical Mercutio, but Husain’s performance breaks from this tradition. After the death of Mercutio, Husain walks with a defeated slouch and one can hear true devastation in his voice, saying “Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury, killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish.”
Gillen and Feinberg also exhibit powerful chemistry. Individually, though Gillen does a respectable job of portraying Romeo, Feinberg’s Juliet outshines him. Feinberg is able to depict Juliet’s innocence without compromising her devotion to Romeo. The result is a Juliet who plucks at the audience’s heartstrings with startling candor. After hearing of Romeo’s banishment, she sobs like a younger girl, her voice wavering. “'Romeo is banished!' There is no end, no limit, measure, bound, in that word's death; no words can that woe sound,” she utters between weeps.
The evocative choreography of Maria-Ilinca Radulian ’11, fight/movement/sex coordinator, should be noted. The delicate sway of the swings is incorporated in the movements of the lovers, adding an air of youthful whimsy to their romance. This is one of many tropes in Grace’s production that highlights what makes Romeo and Juliet a tale of woe: they are too young to handle the depth of their passions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s basketball team has literally had a season of ups and downs.
The Crimson (5-3) has alternated wins and losses over the past seven games after starting the campaign with an encouraging win at Maine. Harvard then traveled to the Navy Classic where the Crimson won the first game against Oral Roberts and then dropped its matchup against host Navy. The road trip continued—this time in-state—as Harvard paid a visit to Boston University and snapped out of the one-game losing streak, only to return to it at Holy Cross. Finally, the Crimson enjoyed home-court advantage for the first time this year on Dec. 3 with a comfortable victory over Hartford. But four days later, an aggressive Florida squad handily beat Harvard, which was on the road once again. Yesterday’s home win over New Hampshire followed the same “rollercoaster” pattern that has yet to end.
So should you bet that the Crimson will lose against Sacred Heart (4-4) 11 days from now? History says maybe you should. A year ago, the Pioneers demolished Harvard, 92-77, led by then-freshman Kiley Evans, who scored 24 points. Funny thing is, this season, Sacred Heart has also alternated wins and losses over the last six games. The latest result for the Pioneers was a victory at Yale, meaning—if you believe in this scheme—that the next couple of games should result in a loss against Siena and a win against Mount St. Mary’s. So when Sacred Hearts travels to Cambridge for its matchup against the Crimson on Dec. 22, both teams are due up for a double dose of loss.
Let’s focus on some real statistics. If Harvard wants a shot at winning, the Crimson will need to shoot well consistently. In its three losses this season, Harvard averaged a dismal 34.3 field-goal percentage—a stark contrast from the near-50 percent shooting averaged in its five wins. The Crimson was also outrebounded, an aspect of the game that Harvard has been trying to improve since the start of preseason. With Sacred Heart putting all four players who scored in double-digits last year on the court, the Crimson will need to come out gunning and rebound well in order to finally press the stop button on this long rollercoaster ride.

Cheerful signs and "Property of CS50" balloons lined the path to Northwest Labs yesterday as students from across campus came out to the annual CS50 fair.Class shirts and merchandise, including multi-purpose stress-relief balls, were widely distributed, and CS50 course instructor David J. Malan '99 let slip the true purpose of the stress balls: branding.
"Someday you’ll get pelted with this in your dorm room and your roommate will say 'Oh! CS50!'" Malan said.
Many websites created for the course have been well received across campus. CrimsonSpark, a website that allows users to “spark” other members they find attractive, already has approximately 1300 registered users.
Several websites were designed to improve the day-to-day lives of Harvard students. Scott Kim '14, for instance, designed a website called "The Harvard Munchies" to help students find out the opening and closing hours of local restaurants—a handy tool for late-night studiers and early-risers.
Some see the annual fair as an important recruiting event for the course itself. Malan was openly enthusiastic about winning new converts to programming, noting that approximately 70 percent of CS50 students had no programming experience prior to enrolling in the course.
"It's absolutely not the sort of course where everyone’s been programming since they were eight years old," Malan said.
Students in attendance were generally very satisfied with the quality of the final projects.
"There are just so many different projects, and they’re all awesome," said Karen F. Xiao '14.

When Thomas M. Kolasa '13 purchased the domain broletariat.com a few months ago, he had every intention to sell it for profit. But after realizing the need for a "hang-out" spot for Harvard bros such as himself, Kolasa decided to create a bro-crastinating site for his CS50 final project.
Advertised as "A place where bros can like... chill," Broletariat features a collaborative Brolloquium, a feed where registered Harvard bros can post notes, photos, and videos, and discuss relevant topics in a “stress-free environment.”
The Broletariat and the Brolloquium are for every type of bro, Kolasa said, even for the people who do not associate themselves with the regular types of bros.
“You can have your physics bros who get together on Friday nights and watch ‘Big Bang Theory,’” Kolasa said. “Through the rigor of quotidian life, we forget that that is what is most important to us. It’s our bromances that define who we really are.”
The site, however, is apparently off-limits to girls. Currently, a link on the homepage that says “Girls Click Here!” begins a fake virus upload that “[o]nly a bro-hater would fall for.”
Kolasa says the site will be revamped post-CS50 during J-Term, when he hopes to add a blog feature for bro debates in addition to blockers—such as hidden links to Twilight sites and quizzes—to keep girls off the site.
An economics concentrator in Mather House, Kolasa had no programming experience before he took CS50 this semester. His final project, he said, helped him personally realize the type of Harvard bro he was.
“Before, I couldn't find my identity, but through the making of this site, I found that I’m a bro-grammer.”
