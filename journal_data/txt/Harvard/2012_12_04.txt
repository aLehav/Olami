After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a grueling auditioning process and weeks of hard work, blood, sweat, and tears, eight singers are ready to take the stage in front of hundreds of audience members. The lights will go up and the crowds will roar, but this is not another episode of "American Idol." This is Berklee College of Music’s biannual Singers Showcase, which will feature eigh tof Berklee’s top singers in addition to a live band and backup dancers. The event, which takes place this Thursday at Berklee Performance Center, is notable for its "Idol"-inspired audition process and historical significance.
This semester, the Singers Showcase features a tribute to R&B diva Whitney Houston, which will comprise the second half of the show. "Her passing is part of [the reason for the tribute]. She has really good sing-able music, and it’s an apropos time," says Professor Ken Zambello, who helped produce the show and participated in the judging process. Even those who aren’t singing in the show have drawn inspiration from Houston. "The theme from 'The Bodyguard'—how many times have I sung that?," says Will H. Lydgate, who plays bass in the live band. "I really like the soulfulness….It’s been fun for me to get a little bit deeper into her music."
Although attention will be centered on the star singers, the other contributing performers work to create a sensational multi-media experience. Choreographed backup dancers add pop flair to some performances, and the live band will play musical styles running the jukebox gamut from pop and rock to jazz and folk. To top it all off, electrical technicians have worked to develop a light show to complement the singers.
Unlike other musical performances at Berklee, the Singers Showcase features a competitive audition process inspired by "American Idol." "We had a meeting at the beginning of the semester, and about 100 to 170 [people] auditioned," says Vincent B. Cannady '13, who auditioned with "Breakeven" by The Script and will be singing the opening song on Thursday. After this initial round, singers prepared for callbacks, in which only 18 to 20 singers are given another chance to compete for the honor of singing in the showcase, explains Zambello. During callbacks, audience members were invited to text their vote for their favorite singer. In previous years, celebrity singers such as American Idol vocal coach Debra Byrd participated in the judging process.
In addition to selecting a famous singer or group to honor during the fall semester show, the Singers Showcase holds historical significance for Berklee. "This…is a historic show—it’s been going on since the 80s, and the team that produces it has been for the most part intact since then. They’re call the Yo Team," says Lydgate. According to Zambello, the "Yo Team" is the production team for Berklee’s student-oriented shows, including the Singers Showcase. "Somebody gave us that nickname 30 years ago when we started," Zambello said. "We don’t talk in English a lot, we just go, 'Yo! Yo!'"
After weeks of practice, Cannady and Lydgate are excited for the upcoming show, which they say will feature Berklee’s most talented singers and musicians across a wide range of classes. "It’s going to be a big full house, we've got some great singers, and we’re just going to play our butts off…. It’s the biggest show at Berklee," says Lydgate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Monday, The New York Times reported that many elite colleges and universities around the country are finding it increasingly difficult to maintain their commitments to generous financial aid packages. Wesleyan University has had to rescind its policy of admitting all candidates regardless of financial need, Williams College and Dartmouth College have begun including loans in financial aid packages, and Grinnell College is considering cutbacks as well. With college endowment growth just about flat across the United States last year, it seems that only the wealthiest universities like Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Stanford, and a few others are insulated from the financial stagnation that has brought trouble to so many peer institutions.
Yet while it is troubling to hear of any cut to university financial aid, this development serves ultimately to highlight the fact that most American college students don’t have the privilege of worrying about whether aid programs at elite universities are rolled back. For the sake of both the affected students at Wesleyan as well as the millions of students at public universities and community colleges, our federal government must prioritize direct aid to college students.
Since the 2008 financial crisis, states have found it increasingly difficult to maintain support for public universities. Ohio State, Penn State, and the University of Michigan receive less than seven percent of their funding from their respective states. To make up the difference, our public universities are forced to rely on out-of-state students who pay private-school prices and crowd out in-state applicants. Public universities, which are generally more affordable than all but the wealthiest private universities and which produce a majority of our college graduates, must not be allowed to whither. The increasing wage gap between college-educated and high-school educated workers means that the United States cannot afford to let even public universities cease to be affordable for aspiring students.
In light of both the persistent strain on our colleges and universities and the “fiscal cliff” negotiations currently consuming Washington, it is essential that our leaders prioritize aid to students. Pell Grants, student loans, and community college support undoubtedly count among the best possible investments we can make today to ensure economic competitiveness in the future. President Obama has proven his commitment to helping students by keeping student loan interest rates low, expanding the Pell Grant program, and setting ambitious goals for community college enrolment.  We hope that these policies survive through January, since increasing college enrollment is vital to maintaining the United States’ competitive edge.
While it is sad to watch excellent universities struggle to meet their financial aid goals, we must remember that many more students are served by public universities and community colleges, which very often cannot meet students’ full financial need. For this reason, direct federal aid to students is an essential component of our national effort to produce a competitive workforce with good wages.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This column is supposed to be about Latin America. But the region has been kind of quiet lately, and Crimson readers don’t seem to care much about Cuba or Chávez, and in any case, this is my last column. So instead I’d like to emulate my friend and fellow columnist Eric T. Justin ’13, who recently wrote about the perils of whining at Harvard, and highlight some unfortunate social tendencies on campus.
On the Harvard admissions website, prospective applicants are told that, “Our Admissions Office chooses carefully from a broad range of applicants who seem to us to offer the most promise for future contributions to society.” It’s a nice, fluffy bit of advice (show some promise!), but the seemingly benign platitude carries more sinister implications. Judging us by our future returns makes us seem suspiciously like investments rather than individuals.
The problem does not lie with the admissions office, however. The problem is that, once we arrive at Harvard, we tend to treat ourselves like investments. Harvard students are obsessed with success—that plushy consulting job after graduation, that prestigious fellowship, that elite medical or law school—and our focus on goals, more often than not, turns us into petty, Machiavellian creatures.
Let me provide a few examples from common areas of campus life. Take academics. I know an alarming proportion of students here who pick their courses based on which classes have a reputation for being easy. They grumble their way through a semester of papers on subjects they care nothing for, cash in their high GPAs, and do it all again next semester. It’s a huge waste, both of our time and of Harvard’s resources. We have some of the finest professors in the world to learn from, and we prefer a sterling number to an education.
Or take extracurricular activities. Do you participate in activities because you view them as opportunities to have a positive impact, or do you approach student organizations as vehicles for self-aggrandizement? I’ve overheard students complain about how much of a drag it is to tutor underprivileged kids, and the smug superiority of it hits me like a slap. As we say in Spanish, “me da pena ajena”—it makes me vicariously ashamed.
Less serious, but more annoying, is the tendency among student groups to present themselves as “professional.” We’re a bunch of 20-year-olds playing dress-up, pretending we’re at the top of our fields. Even if we are, the self-importance of it never ceases to amuse me. Seriousness is a virtue, but after a point it crosses into self-parody.
Lastly, take a subject that is a perennial staple of student conversation, final clubs. The issue of whether some of these locations are safe spaces to party is a serious matter and should not be taken lightly. Criticism of the clubs, however, tends to revolve around claims that they are sexist or elitist. It’s not that I disagree, but such criticism tends to exasperate me more than the clubs themselves. Outside of Harvard, who cares about final clubs? They’re glorified party spots. The fact that a bunch of students who are privileged by the virtue of merely being here sit around and complain about elitist clubs reminds me of those people who make over $1 million but don’t consider themselves wealthy. It shows how narrow-minded we are.
On my more cynical days, I wonder if entering Harvard means you’re automatically enlisted in the world’s most cutthroat collegiate-level rat race, one we’re willing participants in. We’re told time and time again that the best part of Harvard is the other students here—never again will such bright people surround us. I agree, the people here are awesome, and our collective accomplishments impressive. But in pursuing greatness, many of us forget about our fundamental goodness as human beings.
I know I sound preachy, but that’s not my intention. I’ve also partaken in precisely the sort of behavior that I’m describing, and I’ve not enjoyed it one bit. On more than one occasion, I’ve woken up in the morning and just felt like a terrible person (and it wasn’t due to a hangover). My guess is that most people here also have at some point or other in pursuit of their goals. And it all kind of makes me want to move back to Costa Rica and open a beach café or something.
As you go through Harvard, you should remember that, no matter what, you’ve got it made. Forget your transcript or your resume—more likely than not, you’ll find success in the grander scheme of things and on your own terms. So relax, have some fun, take classes you’re passionate about. Don’t screw other people over, but don’t be afraid to screw up. Ask yourself, are the human relations you form actually meaningful? I’ve found a 15-minute conversation with my tattoo artist far more enlightening than hours of networking at recruiting events.
So, my dear readers (if you exist), farewell. Don’t take this place too seriously, and whatever you do, don’t get addicted to it. After all, it’s just college.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The modern American crisis is less poverty than it is poverty of education. Even if politicians are stubbornly stuck in denial, the American population must still grapple with the schizoid battle between bloated sense of entitlement and exceptionalism and the realities of a crumbling education system. While schools around the nation crumble under the weight of overcrowding, teachers work long hours for low pay, and children learn out of decrepit textbooks, the military can order superfluous F-35 fighter planes that cost $1.45 trillion over their lifetime. It’s worth noting that if the insidious enemy costing trillions of dollars in lost human capital and dooming whole communities to vicious cycles of poverty were some external aggressor, the United States would have declared war without hesitation.
When confronted with abysmal international education rankings, including 17th in reading, 23rd in science, and 31st in math, politicians instead blame our educators and teachers. The argument makes as much sense as a patient suing a cardiologist over his obesity or a dentist over his cavity. Gushing libertarianism suddenly evaporates in the public education arena, where leaders from Democratic mayor of Chicago Rahm I. Emanuel to Republican Wisconsin Governor Scott K. Walker have adopted the counterintuitive strategy of blaming and shaming the men and women to whom most of the American population entrusts their children. After all, collective bargaining sounds a lot like collectivization to the untrained ear!
Citing budgetary concerns, politicians shamelessly eviscerate education funds from all educational programs from critical early development programs to state universities. The University of California, Davis, for instance, saw tuition for in-state residents surge from $4,595 in 2002 to $15,123 in 2012, a 229 percent increase. Cuts in needed education programs to fund a wasteful military-industrial complex are myopic and merely procrastination: Standards of living in the U.S. will plateau and ultimately stagger as public education is quietly strangled. In a sad display of American prioritization, the budget of the U.S. Department of Education is only $69.8 billion for 2013, while the Department of Defense will receive $613.9 billion. For every pinpoint explosion springing from multimillion-dollar missiles subsidized by taxpayers, there are many implosions of the American dream into the fragmented debris of apathetic citizenry, financial insecurity, and disillusionment.
Why is it so easy to attack the teachers, principals, and institution of public education while speaking ill of military is akin to political suicide? First, we have to realize that our political leaders are beholden to a single question. It’s not, “How do I help my party?” It’s not even, “How do I better the life of my constituents?” Instead, our democratically elected leaders ask, “Where’s the money, Lebowski?” The men and women elected by the people are no longer entirely for the people. The Supreme Court’s Citizens United case made it clear: Money is speech, and any person (or corporation) who can pay more gets a larger voice. So when defense contractors manufacturing military technology like Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and the like are each putting up over $11 million toward lobbying, most politicians passively tolerate or actively encourage military splurges. On the other hand, teachers’ unions and education advocates have much less money available to purchase our political system.
It’s important to realize that an endless string of deferments and attacks on the institution of public education is unsustainable. Dismantling the public education system discourages the care and community essential to intellectual development. It makes as little sense to completely privatize the education system as it would to privatize the military. Portraying and demoralizing teachers with endless threats of funding cuts and increased reliance on arbitrary standardized testing is one of the more counterproductive strategies we could employ. The anger springing, perhaps rightly, from America’s slip from the pinnacle of education is more effectively spent in holding our leaders’ feet to the fire.
The order to ensure domestic tranquility precedes the commandment to provide for the common defense in our Constitution’s Preamble. Perhaps the citizenry owes it to our Founding Fathers to convey that message: Destroying our domestic tranquility for unnecessary layers of common defense is unacceptable. Our leaders have tuned out the cries of necessity from the American public, choosing instead to subsist on the hawkishness of a swollen industry.

We write on behalf of 56 other current students and alumni of Harvard Law School in response to the Crimson’s October 29, 2012 article entitled, “At HLS, a Tough Path to Public Interest,” and its November 6, 2012 editorial, “Don’t Hate the Player, Hate the Game.” Because we fear that the pieces painted an incomplete picture of the support and resources available to public-interest-minded students at HLS, we seek to highlight the school’s enormous commitment to public interest work.
Both pieces give the inaccurate impression that the school provides little support to students seeking public interest work, and that harsh job realities make it almost impossible (and thus perhaps not worthwhile) to pursue public interest work at HLS. This could not be further from the truth.
In our experiences, the school has done a great deal to make public interest jobs an attractive and realistic option for students, despite a recession that has affected all sectors of the legal job market. One of the law school’s most impressive assets is its strong public interest community, headed by the HLS Office of Public Interest Advising. OPIA provides students with an array of advising and networking opportunities, which have successfully opened avenues to employment for us and for many others. It thus makes little sense to set up a massive on-campus recruiting program for the public sector, as the Crimson suggested, given the constrained budgets, divergent hiring timelines, and alternate hiring processes of many public interest employers.
Moreover, the law school enables its students to pursue public interest opportunities, irrespective of salary, through several generous financial programs. The Crimson briefly noted HLS’s Low Income Protection Plan, Public Service Venture Fund, and post-graduate fellowships. The HLS Heyman Fellowship Program also offers additional grants and loan repayment assistance to alumni in government service. Such programs are directly aimed at balancing some of the “divergent incentives of public and private law.” They are also among the best in the nation. LIPP makes it financially possible for many students in the public sector to shoulder often-heavy debt burdens on limited salaries; post-graduate fellowships provide grants and salary support to graduates in nonprofit or government positions.
In part because of professional assistance from OPIA and financial assistance from HLS, last year 88 students were employed in public interest positions nine months after graduation.  And this figure does not include those who will or did land jobs in the public sector after completing judicial clerkships.
Of course, all this is not to ignore the realities of a challenging legal job market. Nor is it to say that the school could not do even more to promote and enable public interest work. It is simply to note that it is very possible for HLS students to pursue, obtain, and remain in rewarding public interest jobs. We hope that no student who reads the Crimson article is deterred from pursuing public interest law or from doing so at Harvard. Indeed, our experiences at the law school have convinced us that few other law schools are as supportive of or as effective at positioning graduates to succeed in the public sector. In this economy more than ever, the most vulnerable members of society need strong, committed advocates. We are confident that students at HLS will continue to take up the challenge, and that the school will be there for them when they do.

Patricia A. King will step down from her post on the Harvard Corporation at the end of this year, the University announced Monday. King, who is a graduate of Harvard Law School and professor at the Georgetown Law Center, has served on the Corporation since 2006.
An expert in the legal and ethical issues surrounding biology and medicine, King told the Harvard Gazette that her reasons for leaving were family-related, but that it had been a “great privilege” to serve on the Corporation, the University’s highest governing body and the oldest corporation in the Western Hemisphere.
“I will look back on these years with a sense of deep appreciation, and with admiration for the people who make Harvard so extraordinary,” King told the Gazette.
Two years ago, the University announced that the Corporation, which is officially known as the President and Fellows of Harvard College, would undergo a major structural change for the first time in its more than 350 years history.
Term limits were imposed on Corporation members and the size of the membership was increased from 7 to 13. King cited her role in those reforms as an accomplishment she especially valued.
“She has a clear moral compass, a penetrating view of what matters most to Harvard and higher education, and a wonderfully probing, firm, and yet gracious and generous way about her that has contributed invaluably to the Corporation’s work,” Faust told the Gazette.
Harvard’s charter dictates that King’s replacement will be decided by a vote of the Corporation, along with consent from the Board of Overseers, the University’s other, larger governing body.
The Corporation’s composition last changed in September, when Jessica T. Mathews ’67 and Theodore V. Wells, Jr. were selected as its newest members.

Just days after the announcement that former Mexican President Felipe Calderón will assume a fellowship position at the Harvard Kennedy School, Harvard faculty defended the Kennedy School alumnus against criticism of his new appointment.
A petition posted on Change.org asks Harvard to deny Calderón employment at the Kennedy School, claiming that Calderón is responsible for the deaths of innocent people as a result of his war on drug cartels. As of press time on Monday, the petition had garnered over 500 signatures.
Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75 wrote in an email that although he recognizes that not everyone agrees with Calderón’s policies, Kennedy School administrators believe the fellowship offers students the opportunity to “engage with world leaders and to ask difficult questions on important public policy issues.”
But former U.S. Border Patrol agent John Randolph, who started the petition, said he was “outraged” by Harvard’s decision to bring Calderón to Cambridge.
“I don’t understand why we would award someone like Calderón to come here to have a lucrative teaching job at a place like Harvard when there’s so much controversy and so much hatred in his country about the things that happened while he was president,” Randolph said. “I don’t think it’s right.”
Erich Moncada, a Mexican radio host and producer who signed the petition, said he understands that Calderón needed to engage in a drug war to fight criminals and uphold the law. However, Moncada questioned Calderón’s execution of the war, alleging that his military disregarded human rights. In November 2011, the nonprofit Human Rights Watch released a report saying they had found evidence that Mexican security forces were responsible for 170 torture cases, 39 disappearances, and 24 unsanctioned killings since Calderón took office in 2006.
Morgan Smith ’60, a freelance writer and photographer, said he has seen firsthand what he described as disastrous Mexican military tactics during his travels in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico.
Although Smith said he thinks that Calderón’s fellowship at Harvard will bring much-needed attention to the Latin-American nation, he warned that Calderón’s time at Harvard might be “messy” if Calderón is too focused on trying to protect his record and unwilling to engage in honest conversation about the problems facing Mexico.
Harvard professors were Skeptical about the campaign to block Calderón from working at Harvard.
Government professor Steven R. Levitsky said that although Calderón’s administration may have contributed to violence in Mexico in its attempt to fight the drug war, the vast majority of homicides in the country are a result of violence between drug trafficking organizations.
“There are lots of criticisms you can make of the Calderón government, but nothing remotely that would warrant not bringing him to Harvard,” Levitsky said.
Jorge I. Dominguez, government professor and vice provost for international affairs, went a step further, defending Calderón’s legacy as one of improved civil liberties, reduced poverty rates, and faster economic development.
“I am certain...that this is a good person, a good president, and that the Kennedy School did the right thing to appoint him as Fellow,” Dominguez wrote in an email.
Calderón, who left presidential office on Saturday, is slated to begin his new position at the Kennedy School in late January.
There, he will give special lectures, collaborate with researchers, and write case studies based on the challenges he faced in office.

Members of the Harvard community filled the basement of Northwest Labs Monday, waiting over an hour each to donate blood as part of Harvard’s Hurricane Sandy Red Cross Blood Drive.
Harvard Red Cross, the student group that organized the event, hosts four blood drives every year, including one in December.
Because Hurricane Sandy destroyed a great deal of saved blood reserves, the group decided to roll this December’s drive into its larger efforts for hurricane relief, according to Harvard College Red Cross board member Riley J. Brian ’15.
For a month, the group has been raising money through an online fundraising page for Hurricane Sandy relief efforts in New York and New Jersey. As of press time, the group had raised close to half of its $10,000 fundraising goal.
Brian said the number of people who turned out to donate on Monday was significantly greater than the turnout for blood drives hosted by Harvard in the past.
While a Harvard Red Cross blood drive generally brings in about 170 to 175 pints of blood, “this blood drive is looking like a lot more than that,” said Brian.
Rebecca L. Ritchie ’16, among those crowding the basement of Northwest Labs, was studying for her Government 20: “Foundations of Comparative Politics” final while waiting her turn to donate blood.
Although surprised by the length of the queue, Ritchie said she did not mind the wait because it demonstrated the campus’s enthusiasm for the cause.
“It means there are so many people who want to donate,” she said.
The cause attracted not only students, but also staff from across the University and local Cambridge residents.
Stephen S. Leroy, a scientist at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, has given over four gallons of blood in his lifetime.
He had to take a 10-year hiatus from donating after spending a year in Denmark.
His donation at the Harvard drive marks the second time Leroy has given blood since the Red Cross relaxed the restrictions to its donation policies.
“It’s a good habit to have,” Leroy said about donating blood.
The Hurricane Sandy Blood Drive is a three-day event and will continue Tuesday in Northwest Labs and Wednesday in Harvard Hillel.

Harvard College Munch, the recently approved kinky sex discussion group, has been making headlines across the nation after its approval last week by the Harvard administration.
In response to the media firestorm surrounding Munch’s recognition, students have expressed their opinions about the group’s message and official status. For many, the significant outrage over the group’s existence seems unwarranted.
“Honestly, I didn’t think this was a big deal,” said Sally M. Castillo ’14. “It’s a student group that wanted recognition as a student group and got it. I don’t think it merits any more hoopla than even just an initiative to try to make a new social space on campus.”
In fact, many students voiced their support of the new organization’s goals.
One such advocate, who was granted anonymity by The Crimson to protect his privacy, lauded Munch’s ability to force the Harvard community and the nation at large to think about important issues traditionally undiscussed.
“This is an interesting opportunity to talk about what sexual perversion actually means,” he said. “Too often, people think perversion is defined by sexual acts themselves. I think it’s when consent is not present. This club is helping bring more of a focus on consent versus lack of consent in sexual acts. It is challenging our beliefs and forcing us to think about what actually makes an act perverse.”
Mariah T. Browne ’15 applauded Harvard for pushing boundaries in its acceptance of organizations. “At first I was a little surprised about Munch because I’ve never heard of any club like this at any college,” she said. “But then I thought it was really cool that Harvard is offering something like this. I think being an elite institution but still having this sort of group is so beneficial, rather than us always being rooted in old principles. I think it’s really, really great.”
This departure from conventional values, however, was precisely the source of concern for some students.
“At the end of the day, Harvard is a private institution...I understand the university feels it would be wrong to deny this group funding, but a serious line has been crossed,” said Devi Nair ’16, Vice President of the Harvard Republicans Club. “Allowing for such a group tacitly ignores the fact that...modern society still promotes certain boundaries. Allowing for a kinky sex group will only foster similar, if not more extreme clubs within our community.”
The Harvard Republicans declined to officially comment on the subject, according to President Rajiv Tarigopula ’14.

Cast members and special guests of HBO’s ‘The Wire’ mixed and mingled with members of the Harvard community at a reception in the Winthrop House Tonkens Room Monday as part of Winthrop’s Perini-Woods Memorial Speaker Series.
This is the second year the cast of the popular television drama centered on Balitmore’s drug and crime scene has come to Harvard’s campus.
Cast members in attendance included Jamie Hector, who on the show plays the leader of a West Baltimore drug network, and Gbenga Akinnagbe, who plays the drug leader’s best friend. Chad Coleman, who depicts reformed criminal Dennis ‘Cutty’ Wise, also attended the reception.
Earlier on Monday, the cast served as panelists in Law School professor Charles J. Ogletree, Jr.’s “Race and Justice: The Wire” class—one of two courses offered this year at the University on the HBO series.
Jowanna R. Malone ’13, a student in the 25-person seminar African and African American Studies 115: “HBO’s The Wire and its Contribution to Understanding Urban Inequality,” watched the first four seasons of the show for class assignments.
“We’ve been seeing these characters for the whole, entire semester, so when I heard about ‘The Wire’ reception and dinner, I definitely wanted to come,” Malone said.
Nyamagaga Gondwe ’13, Malone’s friend, was similarly inspired to attend the reception by a course she took her sophomore year on race, class, and education.
“A lot of the actors on the show currently run or are part of non-profits that either operate in Baltimore or operate in low-income neighborhoods, and I was interested in learning more about their work in those areas,” Gondwe said.
Wire cast member Akinnagbe said he felt “very welcomed” by the Harvard community and appreciated Harvard’s academic approach to the show.
Both years the cast has visited Harvard, they have also attended events at Winthrop House.
Winthrop House Master Ronald S. Sullivan Jr. said the actors of ‘The Wire’ fit into his vision for the Winthrop speaker series, which attracts a wide variety of people ranging from politicians to actors to artists.
“We bring people whom the students are interested in,” Sullivan said. “‘The Wire’ has made such an impact culturally that so many students watch and love it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard College Writing Program launched a new collaborative mentorship program with East Boston High School this fall, designed to give college-bound public high school students a taste of college life and spark their interest in higher education.
“By entering the world of the university as they work on their admissions essays, high school students may find the application process all the more motivating and their goals more concrete,” wrote Christina K. Becker, the faculty director for the program, in an emailed statement.
The Harvard College Writing Program runs the College’s Expository Writing Program and coordinates resources available to those who need assistance with writing.
The new initiative, known as the College-Bound Mentoring Program, will assist high school students with the college application process by helping them brainstorm possible college essay topics, setting goals and deadlines for application materials, and editing drafts of college essays.
Mentors will also provide high school students with a taste of university life by taking them to events such as lectures and meetings of Harvard’s extracurricular activities.
The new initiative, announced to those on the Writing Program email list in late November, is accepting applications from Harvard students through Dec. 7.
The first set of mentors and mentees will be paired in spring of 2013.
“One of the wonderful things about this program is that it allows the Harvard students to get a sense of the high school student’s voice and passions, so those can be reflected and preserved in the final [college] essay,” wrote Courteney E. Smith ’13, student director of the program, in an email.
Erin O’Hearn, an ESL teacher at East Boston High School, wrote in an email that Harvard’s mentoring program was especially suited to the needs of the school, which has a high proportion of students who are immigrants.
Many of these students will be the first from their families to attend college, according to O’Hearn.
“The critical leap from high school to college can be difficult because of the linguistic barriers and the challenges of cultural integration,” O’Hearn wrote. “Some of them have never even been exposed to the possibility of higher education, much less navigating the system to get there."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For students who want to relive—or rather, watch someone else relive—their awkward middle school days, the Second Annual Carl & Carol Pforzheimer Middle School Talent Show was an opportunity to travel back in time.
In a twist on the standard talent show, Harvard students performed as middle school versions of themselves in the event, held Sunday evening in Pfoho Dining Hall.
Hearkening back to middle school talent shows, the venue was transformed into the Pforzheimer Middle School Cafegymatorium.
The talent show included Pfoho students acting as struggling student performers, misunderstood nerds, and one painfully shy teacher, played by Matthew S. Chuchul ’13.
Before the show began, teachers read a long list of announcements reminding students to buy tickets for the Ménage à Quad dance, reiterating the ban on spaghetti straps, and advertising the next week’s Mathletics game—pitting the Pforzheimer Pfighting Pfactorials against the Mather Middle School Math-ers.
Pforzheimer house tutor Jamie Ciocco ’94, who played a middle school math teacher co-hosting the talent show, promised to have “two asthma inhalers at each table in response to last year’s incident.”
My Ngoc To ’14-15—a Crimson editorial writer—performed a piano rendition of Whitney Houston’s “Saving All My Love for You.”
Channeling a nervous middle school performer, To only lost her composure once during the song. Kevin E. Sikah ’15 put together a piano medley of popular Nintendo game theme songs.
Cassandra L. Rasmussen ’13 played a fantasy-loving nerd who was the “founder, president, and sole member of the Pforzheimer Middle School Middle Earthlings.”
“Last year I read Lord of the Rings and decided I wanted to grow up to become just like J.R.R. Tolkien, except female and with more strong female characters in my work,” said Rasmussen, who sang the first piece of her 12-part “Dragon Ballad.”
In the final act, Ciocco performed a song addressing middle school woes like first crushes, cliques, and “pounds of make-up on your zits.”
Ciocco, who co-organized the event, said that the middle school talent show aims to do more than feature comedic skills.
“Lots of Harvard students had a bad middle school experience, so in a way, it’s cathartic,” Ciocco said. “It’s a way to exorcise the demons of middle school.”

Global security and geostrategy expert Jon B. Alterman discussed Egyptian policy in a lecture entitled “The Egyptian Revolutions and Defining the New Normals” at Sever Hall on Monday night.
The talk, hosted by the Center for Middle Eastern Studies, was part of a lecture series focused on the ongoing transformations in the Arab world.
E. Roger Owen, Middle East history professor and Alterman’s former teacher, introduced him as the “best known and most respected pundit related to Egyptian events.” Alterman has taken four trips to Egypt since the beginning of the revolution and is now the director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic & International Studies in Washington D.C.
Alterman compared the recent Egyptian uprisings to the revolution of 1952, noting similarities in the challenges each group faced to sustain power.
“They find it’s hard to do all the kinds of things in government that nobody talks about in opposition but ends up being the determinant of whether they are successful or unsuccessful,” Alterman said.
Alterman, who was in Egypt during the 2012 elections, pointed out that the country has shown signs of embracing the democratic process.
According to Alterman, though the military’s acquisition of power in 2011 could be described as a coup, their facilitation of democratic elections in 2012 is a promising signal for the future of democracy in Egypt.
“[There were] men making sure [all] the votes were sent straight to the counting office,” said Alterman, “They decided it was more important to preserve the army’s place in Egypt rather than their power.”
Alterman noted that economic progress in the country has been slower than expected with falling job rates and rising prices. However, he expressed hope in the power of the Egyptian people to reverse the worsening trend of the economy.
“The Egyptian public is the last institution that really can stand up against the president. [They are a] different Egyptian public than we’ve ever seen.” said Alterman.
Despite the state of the economy, Alterman does not believe that the Muslim Brotherhood will be easily defeated in the upcoming election.
“If you think the Obama campaign was organized and data-driven,...it pales in comparison to the Brotherhood’s,” Alterman said, “They are uniquely structured to mobilize voters and get them to the polls.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For his first two years of college, David H. A. LeBoeuf ’13 ate lunch in one dining hall and attended classes in just three academic buildings.
By his sophomore year, he felt ready to leave Clark University in his hometown of Worcester, Mass. But Harvard was not on his radar screen. He thought Harvard did not even accept transfer students. Then a friend at Harvard sent him a Crimson article—“College To Resume Accepting Transfer Applications.”
“That’s what really got me to look at it,” LeBoeuf said. “And here I am.”
LeBoeuf was right that Harvard had suspended its transfer admissions program in 2008, due to a lack of available student housing. But since 2010, when LeBoeuf was accepted, Harvard has accepted 13 to 15 transfer students each year, a minuscule 1 to 2 percent of those who apply.
Since 2010, the three tiny classes of transfer students have made their mark on Harvard. Coming to the College after the normally formative freshman year, these students have learned how to make the most out of Harvard in about half the time.
NEVER A FRESHMAN
Transfer students miss out on the freshman experience of living in the Yard, forming a blocking group, and joining a new community on Housing Day.
Even so, transfer students become a part of student life at Harvard, said Director of Transfer Advising Carlos E. Díaz Rosillo.
“It’s remarkable that they really become integrated into the Harvard College community and their House community very quickly,” Díaz Rosillo said. “There isn’t a cohort of transfers that remains in sort of the transfer mentality or the transfer mode for a long time.”
Transfer students find a new sense of community through a variety of avenues, from sports teams to the Houses themselves. Ali A. Farag ’14, a squash player who transferred from the American University in Cairo, found that living in Quincy alongside several members of his team eased his transition, and Katherine M. Fair ’14 said walking onto the lightweight crew team helped her after she came from the University of California, Berkeley. For LeBoeuf, who is also an inactive Crimson news writer, new friends in Pforzheimer House were key.
After Sarah L. A. Erwin ’13 transferred to Harvard, she was able to join the Harvard chapter of the same sorority she was in at Johns Hopkins University, Kappa Kappa Gamma. She said she found Harvard as a whole to be welcoming to transfer students.
“People assumed when they met me that it must be extra hard [to transition], because we’re at a school where friendships are made so soon, and you pick people that you’re going to be living with in your House for your time in college your freshman year,” Erwin said. “I think people maybe overcompensated because they thought that might be the case, but people were so unbelievably nice.”
SECOND TIME AROUND
Christine G. Mascolo, the director of transfer admissions, vets the application of every accepted transfer student. She has noticed that they tend to be more focused when it comes to academics. They have already spent time in college, and as sophomores or juniors, they will have much less time to declare their Harvard concentrations.
Part of what drove LeBoeuf to apply to Harvard was academic intent. At Clark, LeBoeuf’s academic interests fell between departments. Once he came to Harvard as a second-semester sophomore—Harvard gave him three semesters of credit for the classes he took in two years at Clark—the social studies program offered him a chance to study an interdisciplinary field and ultimately write a thesis.
Mascolo said that just by applying to transfer, many students demonstrate an awareness of what they want from their education. Going through the college application process a second time requires students to reevaluate their goals, she said.
Erwin said that the transfer process was a learning experience. “[Applying to transfer] wasn’t anything I really thought I would do, just because you go through the college process once,” Erwin said. “You hope that’s the one and only time.... But it provided me with a really good avenue for introspection, I think, to look at the kind of things I gained from Hopkins, the kind of things I wanted to change, and the things I wished were different.”
HITTING THE GROUND RUNNING
With one or two fewer years to participate in College life, transfer students are often eager to dive into Harvard’s activities right away.
“These are students who are going to need to hit the ground running, both academically and socially,” Mascolo said. “When they get here, I feel like they take advantage of every opportunity that comes their way.”
Not only has Farag won a national title in squash his first year at Harvard, but he has also become interested in researching solar energy.
“I’m trying to take advantage of every resource we have here, because I know that I have one year less,” Farag said.
Erwin initially participated in many extracurricular activities including theater, choir, and the Mission Hill After-School Program.
“I definitely had a bit of a ‘freshman year’ my sophomore year when I joined a million different groups,” she said. “It was really amazing, because I had so many things I knew I was going to join before I got here, and then I found so many other things I didn’t even know existed before coming here.”
Arriving from a small school, LeBoeuf also said Harvard presented opportunities he had not been exposed to before. He comped The Crimson, ran for the Undergraduate Council, and taught civics through the Institute of Politics, plus traveled to Chile over J-term.
“It’s a new excitement,” LeBoeuf said of the opportunities at Harvard. “There are so many things, depending on where you’re coming from, you may not have had....It’s like opening your eyes to a whole world you didn’t even know existed.”
Two and a half years later, LeBoeuf no longer identifies himself as a transfer student when he first meets someone. Instead of a transfer from Clark, he is now a senior at Harvard.
“[Coming to Harvard is] something that four years ago when I was applying for college, I never expected would happen,” LeBoeuf said. “Now here I am, a senior, working on a thesis, having done activities and fellowships. It’s just not a part of my life that I expected, but I can’t think of myself without Harvard anymore.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED 3:22 A.M. 
EdX, an online educational platform launched by Harvard and MIT in May, announced Tuesday that Wellesley College will be the first liberal arts institution to partner with the virtual learning venture.
“Wellesley is ready to contribute our liberal arts perspective to help shape online education, particularly as colleges work to figure out how to bring the small classroom experience to the online learning landscape,” said Wellesley President H. Kim Bottomly. “We are convinced that Wellesley and its outstanding faculty have the creativity and vision to take on this challenge.”
WellesleyX, Wellesley’s subset of edX, hopes to simulate the school’s characteristic style of instruction, which emphasizes close relationships between faculty members and students as well as active discussion-based learning. Given an online environment that has already seen enrollments in the hundreds of thousands, Wellesley faculty agreed that this kind of personalized pedagogy will be the college’s most important contribution to edX.
“The challenge for Wellesley will be to figure out how to structure an online learning environment that allows for the kind of productive inefficiency that we see in a small seminar classroom,” said Adam P. Van Arsdale, an anthropology professor.
Barry Lydgate, chair of Wellesley’s French department, said that the school will have to figure out how to scale their approach to learning.
“The small-scale learning—the intensive mentoring that we do—those things can seem paradoxical in the context of online learning,” Lydgate said. “We still have to figure out if this thing will be scalable.”
Lydgate has already submitted his course on French language and culture to be considered for WellesleyX.
Although Wellesley previously considered exploring online education through for-profit platforms, Lydgate said the college ultimately decided to join edX because of its influence and scope.
“Given the prestige of Harvard and MIT, I think it was kind of a no-brainer for the college,” he said. “I think the administration feels that online learning is the wave of the future.”
EdX President Anant Agarwal said this partnership will “encourage new innovations” in edX online learning technologies to integrate important aspects of humanity courses, such as small discussion forums and feedback on written work.
First announced last May and financed by $30 million investments by both Harvard and MIT, edX grants anyone with a computer free access to a range of courses offered by participating universities. In the last six months, these have grown to include Harvard, MIT, University of California, Berkeley, theUniversity of Texas school system, Bunker Hill Community College, and MassBay Community College. Wellesley is the first women’s college to join.
‘Wellesley has always been unafraid of hosting education initiatives,” said Provost and Dean of Wellesley College Andrew Shennan. “I see some continuity between the founding mission of Wellesley College and the idea that this new technology can bring information to audiences around the country and the world.”
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith echoed Shennan’s enthusiasm for the new partnership.
“As the first small liberal arts institution to join edX, Wellesley demonstrates that interest in this endeavor is not limited to large research universities like Harvard and MIT,” he said. “Instead, it points to the diversity of partner colleges and universities, today and in the future.”
EdX currently offers nine classes, six of which are in computer science. While Wellesley’s course offerings have yet to be finalized, the college will most likely offer four that draw from topics in the social sciences, humanities, and natural sciences, according to Van Arsdale. Lydgate said that faculty from across Wellesley were encouraged by the provost to submit course proposals.
In addition to expanding accessibility to top-quality higher education programs, edX hopes to use data collected from the thousands of virtual enrollees to study and enhance in-person pedagogical methods at each university.
“A blended classroom can be significantly better in quality to a traditional online classroom,” Agarwal said, for reasons such as encouraging active learning and providing instant feedback to students.
Van Arsdale is confident that other liberal arts colleges will follow Wellesley’s example. “Wellesley might be the first, but I’m sure it won’t be the last,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team faced its toughest test of the season yet.
On the heels of three straight wins against Northeast opponents, the Crimson travelled to Athens, Ga. to race against some of the fastest teams in the country.  The UGA Invitational pitted Harvard against six top-10 teams, including two-time defending national champion California.
But in the most competitive meet of the season thus far, sophomore Chuck Katis anchored the Crimson’s sixth place showing with a series of record shattering individual performances.
“I think we were really successful in stepping up our game for these guys,” Katis said.
Katis set school records in gold-medal swims in the 100 and 200 breaststroke. His times in both finals met the NCAA ‘A’ standards, qualifying him immediately for the 2013 NCAA Championships.
“He looked incredibly strong in the water,” co-captain Greg Roop said. “He beat some of the fastest people from the fastest teams in the country by a pretty safe margin. It was very inspiring to see him swim like that.”
Katis kicked off the UGA Invitational on Friday with a solid showing in the 200 individual medley, setting a new personal record en route to a fourth-place finish. His time of 1:46.34 was just 1.19 seconds off the Harvard program record.
But the best was yet to come. On Saturday, Katis broke his own school record with a time of 52.65 in the prelim swim of the 100 breast. Just hours later, Katis clocked in an even better time of 52.49 in the finals for the event, beating out All-American Trevor Hoyt of Cal for the victory.
Having beaten the ‘A’ standard time by 0.11 seconds, Katis secured his berth to the 2013 NCAA Championships in the event.
But the sophomore was not done yet. On Sunday, Katis hit the pool for the 200 yard breast stroke. Yet again, he bested his own school record in the prelims, with a time of 1:54.57.
Katis then went on to shave nearly half a second off his time in the finals en route to a second win and yet another ‘A’ standard time. His final time of 1:54.08 was the second best time in the country this year.
“Chuck has an incredible focus on his training so far this year,” Roop said. “He goes down the pool for two or three extra workouts each week.  He is extremely focused. When we got to this meet, you could see that he was really dialed in and ready to swim fast.”
In one of the final events of the meet, Katis teamed up with junior Chris Satterthwaite, fellow sophomore Griffin Schumacher, and junior Oliver Lee in the 400 yard freestyle relay. The Crimson finished in third with a time of 2:55.45.
“[When] we came in [to this meet], everyone had different levels of rest, taper, and shave, Katis said. “We put together a lot of great relays. A lot of the guys had lifetime bests, and they weren’t even 100% prepared, they weren’t fully rested or shaved. That says something about what our team is capable of, really stepping up to the next level with the top teams in the country. It’s where we need to be.”
The exposure to the best programs in college swimming gave Katis and the Crimson a taste of what they can expect later on in the season, as they look ahead towards the Ivy League and NCAA Championships.
Last year, Katis was one of five swimmers to represent the Crimson at the NCAA finals. He picked up a 25th place finish in the 200 breast stroke and finished in 20th place in the 100 event. He also earned All-American honorable mention accolades as a part of the Crimson’s 400 free relay team.
For Katis, the UGA meet was an important benchmark towards propelling the Crimson into the top ranks of intercollegiate swimming.
The sophomore has punched his ticket to the NCAA Championships, and he hopes his teammates will soon follow suit.
“I really want to lead a big group of guys to the NCAA,” Katis said. “Whether or not people get cuts now or later at our conference meet, it is a really important step for our team to make. We have an incredibly fast recruiting class coming in next year. We have work to do, but these are just stepping stones on the way to becoming a top 20, top 10 school.”

The Harvard men’s basketball team will not have to travel far on Tuesday when it visits Boston College in search of its second straight win.
In the crosstown rival Eagles (3-4), the Crimson (3-3) faces an opponent that looks strikingly similar to itself. Both squads have yet to post consecutive wins this season and have looked towards young players to shoulder the offensive burden.
For Harvard, freshman point guard Siyani Chambers and sophomore forward Wes Saunders—who leads the Crimson with 15.8 points per game—have seen the most playing time for the Crimson, averaging 37 and 35 minutes per game, respectively.
For the Eagles, sophomore forward Ryan Anderson leads the team with 14.2 points per game, followed closely by freshman guard Oliver Hanlan, averaging 13.9.
“[Boston College is] young in their years, but they have experience, which is something that we are lacking in our freshman or even our sophomores,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said.
This season, Harvard has been forced to adapt after losing its top four scorers, forcing players like Saunders and Chambers into larger roles than expected.
“[Saunders is] a guy that we need to do everything,” Amaker said. “We need him to handle the ball, we need him to score, and we need him to rebound. He’s our best perimeter defender.”
Despite posting a season-high six turnovers last time out against Fordham, Amaker said that he is pleased with how Chambers has controlled the ball and created opportunities under pressure.
“Right away, because of the situation, he’s been able to shine a little brighter than most would have thought,” Amaker said.
While the Crimson and the Eagles have had similar performances this season, last year’s matchup was a different story.After falling behind 14-3 to open the game, Harvard rallied to open up a 40-33 lead at the half and never looked back, putting up a decisive 67-46 victory. It was the Crimson’s fourth consecutive win over Boston College. In order to secure a fifth, Amaker says that Harvard will need to focus on limiting the Eagles from behind the arc.
“I think it’s going to be really important for us to defend the three point line,” Amaker said. “They have a lot of shooters they can put out to spread the floor, so our discipline defending threes is critical.”
After giving up a season high 85 points in a loss to Vermont last Tuesday, Amaker shook up the lineup in the victory against Fordham on Saturday. Three freshmen saw their first career starts, including forward Agunwa Okolie, who put up 11 points in 27 minutes of play. Besides playing 18 minutes against Manhattan in November, Okolie, who missed time due to illness, has played a combined three minutes during the rest of the season.
After using the same starting lineup for the first five games of the season, Saturday marked the first time Amaker deviated from his go-to lineup. Amaker has yet to announce the starters for the game against Boston College, and he commended the freshman for their composure against the Rams.
“We like what we did for last game,” Amaker said. “It was needed for our team, and I thought some kids deserved the opportunity based on how we defended in the previous game…. They weren’t deer in the headlights. They moved their feet very well defensively.”
The Crimson will confront a familiar face on Tuesday in Eagles’ forward Andrew van Nest, who joined Boston College as a graduate student to use his fourth year of NCAA eligibility after playing three seasons at Harvard.
Van Nest averaged 2.3 points per game in 39 games with the Crimson, including two minutes of play in last year’s victory over the Eagles. This year, he has played in all seven games for the Eagles and is averaging 5.7 points per game.
Harvard will look to continue improving from the charity stripe after shooting a season-low 65 percent in its loss to Vermont. On Saturday, the team improved to 74 percent shooting on 39 attempts with Saunders scoring 13 of his 17 points on free throws.
The Crimson will also focus on putting the game away early. In the 73-64 victory over Fordham, Harvard led by only three points at the break, and against Vermont the team had been outscored 48-34 by the end of the first half.
“We’ve got to have a good start to the game, which is something we haven’t had in a while,” junior co-captain Laurent Rivard said. “It’s always harder to battle back in a game.”
A win against the Boston College would give Harvard its first road victory and put the team over .500 for the first time since its season opening victory against MIT.
“We have a young team, so I was kind of expecting that it was going to be a little up and down,” Saunders said. “I think if we just stay together and keep working every day we’ll figure it out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s basketball team will square off against Providence College—a team that has topped the Crimson in the team’s last five meetings—on Tuesday night at Lavietes Pavilion. Harvard (6-2) will host the Friars (2-5) looking to reverse history after Providence pulled away against the Crimson, 71-60, a season ago.
While attempting to break one streak, Harvard will also try to extend a different one as it goes for its fourth straight victory after beating Eastern Michigan, New Hampshire, and Hofstra. Most recently, the Crimson edged the Pride in a 70-67 overtime battle. The game was the first overtime contest for Harvard this season.
“We need to acknowledge a mature mentality in big situations like that,” co-captain Emma Golen said. “We were finally able to have that attitude and put it together and really pull off a win, which is very exciting.”
The Friars most recently fell to Hartford, 66-39, on Saturday in a contest that saw just one player from Providence, senior guard Symone Roberts, record double-digit points. She finished with 10.
The squad graduated their top two scorers from last season, forwards Teya Wright and Rachel Barnes. Wright and Barnes combined to score an average of 23 points per game last year.
This year, the Friars offense is led by Roberts and sophomore guard Tori Rule. Roberts averages 13.1 points per game and has been pesky on defense, tallying 24 steals this season—three more than all of the other four starters have recorded put together. Rule, who averaged 1.2 points per game last season, has improved to 12.1 points per game.
“Our schedule is kind of funky in that Hofstra and Providence have a lot of similarities, so it feels like in preparing for Hofstra we were also preparing for Providence,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “I think Providence is a very athletic team. They don’t have the power and the frontcourt like Hofstra does, but they have a lot of quickness and athleticism in their guard spots, so it’ll be a similar game.”
Senior forward Brianna Edwards provides power on the glass, grabbing 41 offensive rebounds and 67 total boards this season, both team-highs. Sophomore forward Chanise Baldwin has also been a force under the glass with a team-high 38 defensive boards.
“[Providence is] a very similar team to Hofstra in that they’re very athletic, very quick, and they’re going to try to drive to the basket a lot,” Golen said.
The Friars have stumbled on the road, failing to win any away games thus far this season, and have had difficulty behind the arc, with just 74 three-point attempts and a 14.9 percent success rate on those shots. On the other hand, the Crimson has drilled 42.5 percent of its treys this season.
On Saturday, Harvard persevered against Hofstra in a down-to-the-wire contest in which senior Victoria Lippert led the Crimson in scoring for the second straight game with 21 points. The 6’0” forward was named Ivy League Player of the Week for the second time this season and third time in her career on Monday.
Junior guard Christine Clark joins Lippert as one of Harvard’s top scorers. Clark hit all five of her free throw attempts against the Pride and notched 14 points during the game. During the final 38 seconds of overtime on Saturday, a pair of foul shots by Lippert tied the game and then another two points from the charity stripe by Clark gave Harvard the win.
“We were definitely excited to pull out a win there,” Golen said. “We knew it was going to be a close game.... It came down to the last two possessions, so I think what won it for us [was] our ability to dig down on defense.”
Despite Providence’s weak record, Harvard maintains a careful attitude towards a team that it has not beaten since the 2003-04 season.
“We’ve seen a lot of what Providence does in our opponents,” Delaney-Smith said. “We’re well prepared to defend Providence because they have similarities to some opponents we’ve already played. We just have to be healthy [and] be ready.”
Golen echoed her coach’s sentiments and hoped to repeat the defensive effort which allowed a victory over Hofstra.
“We definitely weren’t happy with the loss [against Providence] last year,” Golen said. “It was just a rough game for us, so we’ll need to bring that same defensive mentality and more consistency to the game this year to pull out a full 40-minute great game with them.”

Lulu Z. Li, a student at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, has created a website called Bikenapped, where people can find data about bicycle thefts, view locations where thefts have taken place, and post their own stories and advice. Li's inspiration came from her own traumatic past. She owned the same bicycle from fourth grade until her sophomore year of college at Yale, when the lock was broken and the bike stolen. She then bought a cheaper replacement bike, only to have it stolen in less than three weeks.
 
What started out as a project for an urban design class is now a site with more than 600 logged visitors that has been praised by both the MBTA and the Boston Cyclists Union. The site aims to raise awareness by locating and identifying areas in which a high number of thefts occur. Bikenapped encourages visitors to print out bright yellow flyers to leave as warnings in places where their bikes have been stolen.
 
"The flyers are intended as a physical push for people to take action and for [Bikenapped] to perpetuate itself with help from the community to keep it alive and growing," Li said.
 
Li hopes that the site will engage horizontally with the community, creating a network of people without the need for overhead management. One way this is achieved is through a feature that allows visitors to post their own stories and interact with a map of Cambridge to pinpoint thefts. While most of the stories are practical and to the point, some are especially moving.
 
"There was one woman whose bike was stolen from behind two locked doors and a cable lock," Li recalled. "That bike was the last present her dad gave her before he passed away."
 
Other stories, however, are not quite as poignant. One user once wrote several paragraphs, explaining in detail how he would extract revenge on the bike thief, along with a promise that a friend would show her boobs to anyone who found and returned the bike.
 
Li hopes her site will spread farther than the immediate Cambridge Area. She wants to reach as far as the West Coast, where there is a large cycling community which she thinks would benefit from awareness of high bike theft areas.
