After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With recently confirmed cases of meningococcal meningitis B at Yale and Providence College, Harvard administrators have contacted students about outbreak and prevention of the infection.
On Friday night, Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde sent a College-wide email containing a message from University Health Services Director Paul Barreira. Barreira wrote that although no cases of meningitis have been reported at Harvard, the University will continue monitoring the situations on the other campuses closely.
In the message, Barreira informed students about symptoms of the infection, such as sudden onset fever, intense headache, nausea and vomiting, and a red/purple rash. He wrote that early treatment can help prevent spread or complications of meningitis, but symptoms can often escalate quickly. Students were told in the email to take preventive measures centered around good hygiene such as washing hands frequently.
All incoming freshman at Harvard are required to receive a meningococcal vaccine which protects against the A, C, Y, and W-135 serotypes. A new B vaccine exists but is not recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for routine immunization, according to the email.
At Yale, where there is one CDC-confirmed meningitis case, Yale Health will soon be offering the B vaccine for free to those with Yale Health Hospitalization/Specialty coverage, according to the Yale Daily News.
From March 2013 to March 2014, there were nine cases of meningococcal meningitis B associated with Princeton. One of those cases, a female student at Drexel University died of meningitis B after having close contact with Princeton students.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Heading into this weekend’s action, the Harvard men’s volleyball team had played exactly two matches lasting more than three sets—one against No. 2 Lewis to open the season and another against Sacred Heart to open EIVA competition.
This weekend, the Crimson doubled this total with away matches against Princeton and NJIT. After falling to the Tigers in a four-setter, No. 13 Harvard bounced back with a tight 3-1 victory over the Highlanders.
“They were tight games,” co-captain Caleb Zimmick said. “There’s a lot of parity [in the league]. Every night we’re going to have to bring it.”
HARVARD 3, NJIT 1
Nineteen hours after a dispiriting loss to Princeton, a longtime EIVA titan, the Crimson was locked in a battle with a less-expected rival.
NJIT, who entered the contest without a conference victory, took the first set, 26-24, and traded the lead throughout the second with the Crimson. But with Harvard clutching a 23-22 advantage, the Highlanders undid themselves. A missed serve and an attack error lost the game for NJIT.
The Crimson took it from there. Co-captain D.J. White and junior outside hitter Branden Clemens combined for 31 kills, and Harvard rolled back the Highlanders, 3-1, in Newark, N.J.
“We were passing better,” Clemens said. “In the first set, that was the weak point, and that may have been the reason we dropped the first set. On the whole, I think today was a lot cleaner play.”
The drama was not contained to the second set, as the final two games were decided by the smallest possible margins. In the third set, an exchange of kills ended with a 25-23 Crimson victory; in the fourth set, freshman middle blocker Brad Gretsch racked up a kill and then a block assist to cement a 26-24 win.
Gretsch’s rejection encapsulated the excellence of the Harvard defense against NJIT. Led by five block assists by Zimmick, the visitors put up 17 blocks, compared to 11 by the Highlanders.
The largest lead in the game was six, which the Crimson held midway through the fourth set. Although NJIT came back to tie the game at 24, the Highlanders conceded the next two points and the match.
“It was just hanging tough,” Zimmick said. “Tonight we got the kills when we needed to and converted when we needed to whereas against Princeton we didn’t.”
PRINCETON 3, HARVARD 1
A six-two run. A five-one run. A four-one run.
These were the streaks that the Tigers used to win the second, third, and fourth sets, respectively as the Princeton ability to show up in the biggest moments proved decisive in a 3-1 Harvard loss at Dillon Gym.
The most significant run occurred with the Crimson holding a 25-24 lead in the fourth set and the chance to force a fifth set. Instead, five points later, Harvard was walking out of the gym defeated.
The final result overshadowed a fine performance from White, who recorded a double-double with 14 kills and 12 digs.
“D.J.’s a great player, so it doesn’t surprise me,” Zimmick said “He runs a really fast net, which is advantageous in terms of beating the block to the ball.”
Six of White’s finishes came in the first game, which the Crimson took, 26-24. In this case, it was Harvard that mounted an efficient eight-two run to drop the Tigers.
On the night, Princeton out-blocked the Crimson 16 to six. Cody Kessel, who recorded six block assists to complement a game-high 22 kills, led the hosts in the category.
In the third set, Kessel scored five kills as the Tigers came back from a 15-11 deficit. The game remained close until 21-all, when Princeton won the game with four straight points.
“I don’t think it was a lack of focus or ability,” Zimmick said. “It was just not being able to complete points…. We had enough chances, and we just weren’t able to close.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two rivals met again in the CSA Team Championship final on Sunday, but this year brought a different outcome. The No. 1 Harvard women’s squash team (13-1, 3-1 Ivy) brought home the Howe Cup as the national champion after defeating No. 3 Trinity (17-2), 7-2, at the Barnaby Courts in the Murr Center.
To get to its seventh consecutive finals appearance, the Crimson faced off against No. 8 George Washington (9-7) on Friday and No. 4 Princeton (12-3, 5-2) on Saturday.
HARVARD 7, TRINITY 2
Sunday’s match marked the third consecutive year in which the two teams have met in the CSA final. The Crimson took the first meeting, 5-4, but last year, Harvard saw its undefeated record fall in the final, as the Bantams avenged their earlier loss, defeating the Crimson by the same score.
Looking to avenge its own defeat, Harvard also entered Sunday attempting to keep its No. 1 ranking, which it attained after defeating Trinity in the two teams’ previous meeting on Feb. 6. Trinity went into the game hoping to repeat history. Last year, the Crimson defeated the Bantams earlier in the season, before the side from Hartford, Conn. ultimately took the championship game.
“Going into the finals against Trinity having just beat them 8-1 [two weeks] before, we definitely knew we had it in us to do it again, and to reproduce the same performance without getting too ahead of ourselves,” freshman Sue Ann Yong said.
After earning shutouts in three of its last four matches, Harvard had to grind out a win on Sunday, as six of the nine individual matches lasted more than three games.
But with the Crimson leading, 4-2, junior Michelle Gemmell clinched the victory. After dropping the first two games, Trinity rookie Julia LeCoq fought off one championship point en route to a third game win. But Gemmell took the fourth game, 13-11, to give her side the title.
Junior Isabelle Dowling had the longest match of the afternoon, playing five games in her 2-3 loss to Sachika Balvani at the No. 9 spot. Dowling took the first game by a six-point margin, 11-5, but dropped the next two. She took the fourth game to stay alive in the contest, but the junior could not pull out the win, falling, 11-8.
Junior Saumya Karki earned Harvard’s first win of the day at the No. 6 position. Like Dowling, she defeated Salma El Defrawy in the first game, 11-5. Defrawy took the second game, before Karki put away the next two to win the match, 3-1.
Senior Amanda Sobhy, Yong, and senior Julianne Chu had the only sweeps of the day. At the No. 1 position, Sobhy, the top-ranked collegiate player in the nation, was the only one of the three who needed just 11 points to win each of her games.
Yong, who had an undefeated inaugural season with the Crimson, had a long first match at the No. 5 spot, just edging out Trinity tri-captain Ashley Tidman in three close games. All of Chu’s games at the No. 8 position were hard fought, with the last one finishing 12-10.
Yong’s fellow freshman standout, Alyssa Mehta, won 3-1 at the No. 3 spot. Mehta took the first two games, but Anna Kimberly started to make a comeback by taking the third game. Kimberly’s momentum was halted, though, as Mehta won the fourth game, 11-9, and the match.
Sophomore Dileas MacGowan also contributed a 3-1 victory to help cement Harvard’s championship win.
“I think at the end of the day, the winners will be the ones who [want] it the most,” Yong said. “And we really really wanted it. Win or lose, we were going to give it our everything and be really hard to beat.”
HARVARD 5, PRINCETON 4
On Saturday the Crimson came from behind to clinch a spot in the finals with a 5-4 win over the Tigers. Harvard trailed 3-1 and then 4-2 at the end of the second flight, but Sobhy and Gemmell tied up the match with consecutive 3-0 victories. It came down to MacGowan, who also swept her opponent, giving the Crimson a spot in the finals.
“Being 3-1 down against Princeton and beating them in a close 5-4 match was big,” Karki said. “All the players showed a lot of grit and just hung in there and performed really well under pressure.”
HARVARD 9, GEORGE WASHINGTON 0
Harvard registered its eighth sweep of the season on Friday, as the team kicked off the CSA Tournament against the Colonials.  All nine players finished the match without dropping a single game, propelling the team into the semi-finals against Princeton.
“This has been an exceptional season and a great learning experience,” Karki said. “It was one of the toughest in terms of quality of competition and injuries, but the team showed a lot of maturity and really grew through the season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While another blizzard was roaring through Cambridge, the Harvard women’s tennis team traveled to sunny Northern California to take on two of the nation’s top teams this weekend. On Saturday, the No. 46 Crimson fell to No. 10 Stanford and on Sunday Harvard was defeated by No. 5 California.
Harvard fell 7-0 both days in outdoor matches, but the young Crimson team (4-3) was able to keep it competitive against many nationally ranked singles and doubles players. During her time as coach, Traci Green said she has made it a priority to schedule challenging nonconference matches for her team.
“We can play against anybody,” Green said. “We like to play a tough schedule and we know the season’s going to be tough for us. We’re not afraid to schedule tough opponents and we’re looking to build off this.”
CALIFORNIA, 7, HARVARD, 0
Harvard was no match for a Golden Bears team (5-1) that featured five nationally ranked singles players and two nationally ranked doubles teams. Bears sophomore Maegan Manasse, the nation’s No. 1 collegiate player, defeated freshman Nikki Kallenberg, 6-2, 6-1.
“You could definitely tell that they were [top-level programs],” sophomore June Lee said. “On bigger points and at crucial times, they were able to step it up and execute. They also play higher level teams [more often] than we do.”
Junior Amanda Lin played in the tightest match of the day for the Crimson, taking a set from Cal senior Cecilia Estlander before falling in the third. Lin, Harvard’s sixth singles player on Sunday, was the only Crimson player to take a set from her opponent in the two days of action.
“This definitely is a good learning experience and it gives us encouragement because we know that we can compete with teams like this,” Lee said. “We should just have confidence going forward from here and if we can compete with these guys, we can be able to compete and win our next matches.”
Playing from the second singles position, Monica Lin fell to junior Klara Fabikova, 6-2, 6-4, while freshman Ellen Jang-Milsten lost to No. 20 Zsofi Susanyi. Amy He and captain Sylvia Li both dropped 6-1, 6-1 contests to nationally ranked Cal players.
In doubles action, Harvard’s top duo of M. Lin and freshman Annika Ringblom fell to eighth-ranked Manasse and sophomore Denise Starr while Li and Jang-Millsten were bested by Fabikova and Susanyi, the nation’s 16th-ranked collegiate duo.
STANFORD, 7, HARVARD, 0
Harvard began its West Coast swing on Saturday against a Cardinal team (6-0) that was looking to end the Crimson’s win streak at three. In first singles, Kallenberg fell in straight sets to sophomore Carol Zhao, the 10th-ranked collegiate player in the nation. Ringblom, the hero of last weekend’s victory over North Texas, and fellow first-year Ellen Jang-Milsten both fell in straight sets, 6-1, 7-5.
Li was also able to take the second set in her match against Stanford junior Lindsey Kostas to a tiebreaker, falling 6-2, 7-6. M. Lin lost, 6-3, 6-2, to 14th-ranked Caroline Doyle while He was defeated by senior Ellen Tsay, 6-1, 6-2.
“It’s always a great opportunity when we got to face top Pac-12 schools, especially one like Stanford, with such a great history and tradition,” Green said. “We were a little bit outmatched in the doubles portion, but we started to find our stride in the singles in most of our second sets.”
On the doubles side, the Cardinal’s fifth-ranked duo of Zhao and sophomore Taylor Davidson made quick work of Monica Lin and Ringblom while He and Kallenberg fell to Kostas and fellow junior Krista Hardebeck.
“It’s always a great experience to play top players,” Green said. “You get to see the game played at another level and get to really test your own skills and I think our squad benefitted this weekend quite a bit and we’re looking to build on that momentum.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The third time was the charm for Harvard wrestling this weekend, as the Crimson (3-7, 1-6 EIWA) notched consecutive wins over Brown and Johnson and Wales, nabbing its first conference victory in the process.
“It felt really good getting two wins under our belt,” said senior David Ng. “There’s a really big difference between being 1-7 and 3-7. Our guys wrestled really hard and you could really see that things were starting to click, so are really excited about that.”
HARVARD 30, JOHNSON AND WALES 16
Fresh off the win over Brown, the Crimson pulled away from Johnson and Wales late for a 30-16 win.
“Everybody was loose and there was a relaxed excitement that I hadn’t really seen this year,” Ng said. “You can tell that guys are feeling more confident and are just wrestling, and doing the things that we practice day in and day out on the competition floor.”
Freshman Josef Johnson continued his strong performance on the season, grabbing another win against Johnson and Wales, outmaneuvering Ken Dougherty, 4-1.
“He’s really been keeping up the momentum and making a great effort out there for our team,” Ng said.
Another big contributor was junior Devon Gobbo, who earned his second pin of the day against the Wildcats, in one of his first contests back from being injured.
“It’s great having Devon back,” Ng said. “He got us two pins that we really needed, and it was a solid performance from him on the day. Having him back in the lineup is great for us, he’s a leader on the team and he really inspires us all to work harder.”
Following Gobbo’s win, the Crimson was on a streak that would not stop until the end of the contest. The Harvard wrestlers had their arms raised for the next four matches, notching a commanding lead in the final stretch, with Johson, Michael Mocco, Popple, and Ng each notching a win against the Wildcats.
“This weekend was a big step for our team,” Gobbo said. “It was great to get two wins, but more importantly, everyone went out and battled. We fought for every point, and in the end that was difference.”
HARVARD 21, BROWN 17
The Crimson’s first opponent on the weekend was EIWA foe Brown (4-9, 2-5), who went into the match up with a 4-8 record. Harvard came out on top with a narrow 21-17 win.
While an initial forfeit at 125 set Harvard back six points from the start, the Crimson battled the entire match to come back and clinch its first EIWA win of the season, anchored by back-to-back decisions from Josh Popple and Ng at the very end of the match.
“We really needed Josh to win that match, and him getting a major decision was huge,” Ng said. “After he went out there, I was able to go in and get a major decision as well. We all really just went out and battled against Brown and that was great to see and be a part of.”
Following the first round forfeit, Harvard’s Ryan Osleeb got the Crimson on the scoreboard with a decision over Ezekiel Salvo, closing in on the Bears to bring the team score to 3-6.
Junior co-captain Todd Preston continued the streak as he posted a major decision over Anthony Finocchiaro, giving Harvard its first lead of the day at 7-6.
“Todd always does a great job for us,” Ng said. “He goes out every match and fights for every position.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While a basketball game is 40 minutes long, the Harvard women’s basketball team have set the tempo for the outcome of its games in the first few.
It’s a sentiment the whole team has echoed: if the Crimson (10-12, 3-5 Ivy) doesn’t come out strong, the team struggles. That pattern continued this weekend. In a weekend road trip to New York, Harvard lost to Columbia (7-14, 1-6) Friday night, 59-43. However, the women were able to turn things around on Saturday night when they defeated Cornell (14-8, 5-3) by a score of 61-57.
HARVARD 61, CORNELL 57
Coming off of a tough loss to the Lions, the Crimson decided to shake things up.
“We actually changed everything,” junior forward AnnMarie Healy said. “[Coach] Kathy [Delaney-Smith] rewrote our whole pregame rituals and our pregame warm up and we actually adjusted everything, especially how we prepared for the game.”
“It was great to be able to see our team persevere, “ Healy continued. “Cornell is a really great team who has done really well in the Ivy League so it was good to kind of give it to them and come out with a win.”
In the end, these changes appeared to make a difference. Harvard came out strong, going on an 8-0 run to start the contest, which set the pace for the rest of the match.
Though the Big Red would battle back and go on a 13-3 run, the Crimson did not back down and ended the half down by only four.
The back-and-forth scoring continued in the second half before junior guard Kit Metoyer sparked a late 14-3 Harvard run. Metoyer, who recently joined the starting lineup, had a season-high 12 points in the win.
The run gave the Crimson a cushion down the stretch, something the team has not had often this season. Harvard has had seven games this season that have ended within four points, and has gone 4-3 in those contests.
“In our other close games we are usually the people that are down in the last few minutes,” Healy said. It’s nice to be able to feel comfortable and feel that we were able to control the game in a more calm setting.”
The Crimson’s advantage in the post continued, as Harvard outscored Cornell in the paint 28-13. Senior forward Erin McDonnell led the charge with 17 points.
“We just played without regard to the circumstance,” senior forward Temi Fagbenle said. “We didn’t try not to lose, we didn’t try to win, we just tried to play Harvard basketball and not think of the outcome. It wasn’t perfect by any means, we still had a lot of mistakes and didn’t even play to our full potential but we were happy to come out with the win.”
COLUMBIA 59, HARVARD 43
In the first nine minutes of Friday’s contest, to say that the Crimson struggled would be an understatement, Fagbenle said. The Lions, who were winless in the Ivy League prior to Friday night, went on a 20-4 run to put Harvard out of reach early on.
“We basically beat ourselves,” Fagbenle said.
Turnovers plagued the Crimson, as it gave away the ball 13 times in the first period of action. However, Columbia was unable to take advantage and had 10 points off of turnovers in the entire game.
Besides struggling to hold on the ball, Harvard struggled to put the ball in the net. The Crimson shot only 22.4 percent from the field over the course of the game, with McDonnell leading the team in scoring with just 10 points.
The team fared better on the defensive end, holding the Lions to just 34 percent shooting and matching Columbia in rebounds with 46 apiece, but its poor offensive play prevented Harvard from taking advantage of Columbia’s similarly poor shooting.
The Crimson continues its Ancient Eight stretch of the season next weekend, where the team is once again on the road to face Penn and Princeton. Harvard will look to win its first consecutive Ivy League contests as it has yet to string together multiple conference wins.
