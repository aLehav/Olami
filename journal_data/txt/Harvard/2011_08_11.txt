After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
TOULOUSE, France—Another normal, slow day at work, I reflect, as I board the metro to return home.
However, two stops later, a contingent of three officers of the national police and three soldiers of the ground army security force board the train. Despite growing up in the land of the second amendment, the NRA, and “CSI: NY,” I am shocked by the armed soldiers’ presence on this crowded train. They seem to be an affront to the normal pace of life. The soldiers are carrying FAMAS assault rifles.
Upon closer inspection, the two male soldiers are unnaturally tall and still, balanced on the speeding metro without effort or support. The female soldier is mostly out of my view but seems to be wearing the same staid countenance. The rifles show signs of wear: silver metal is visible behind peeling black paint. Though I doubt that they’ve ever been fired outside of training exercises, I wonder.
A noticeable pall falls over the train. The tension in the air is palpable; the conversation, smothered. A mother boards the train with her young daughter, perhaps eight years old. “We’ll just stand here. It doesn’t change anything,” says the mother as they stop just inside the door. The mother faces her daughter towards the door and places herself between the girl and the soldiers.
I can’t resist looking at the gun, its barrel hovering no more than six feet in front of me. The door to the other car is locked. The seats are plastic, and at this range, a 5.56mm NATO round can punch straight through a body with enough force to through-and-through a second person. The idea of bullets traveling near Mach 3 and fragmenting in my torso suddenly puts burst eardrums at the bottom of my list of worries.
I hope that they’re really members of the French army.
As the soldiers disembark from the train a couple stations later, muscles relax and conversation resumes. Many French citizens I’ve spoken to abhor the war in Afghanistan, a conflict that has already claimed over 70 French lives. New passengers, oblivious to the soldiers that departed a stop earlier, breathe fresh life into the train that was sobered by reminders of death and war that seemed uncomfortably close to home.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
LONDON—On Friday, I met a former English teacher of mine for lunch near his home in Brixton, a neighborhood in South London. As he gave me a quick tour of Brixton—a diverse, somewhat rundown area with a lively market—he shared his belief that the neighborhood had improved greatly since riots, which were motivated by race issues and social discontent, took place there in the 1980s.
I’m sure it has, but less than three days after our meeting hundreds of looters stormed an electronics shop in Brixton. It is a familiar story in London’s urban sprawl—often in its poorer, more marginalized outer areas, such as Tottenham, Croydon, and Hackney. It all started on Thursday in the northern neighborhood of Tottenham, after police lethally shot Mark Duggan, a local father of four and alleged gangster. A peaceful protest soon descended into anarchy, and over the following few days dozens of areas around the metropolis bore witness to arson and looting. As I write these words, there is a strong likelihood that the violence will repeat itself this Tuesday evening, despite police efforts to the contrary. It’s not an exaggeration to say that riots have engulfed the city.
It is clear that the thousands of youths hurling bricks and stones at police on the streets of London aren’t protesting the death of Mark Duggan. The vast majority of them didn’t even know him. The real victims of this tragedy are the now homeless residents of the torched building in Tottenham. They include Aaron Biber, an 89-year-old barber, who lost his business in the mayhem. Yet a little part of me thinks the rioters, even if not justified in their actions, deserve to be understood.
London’s gross inequality is difficult to ignore. Some hotels charge 40 pounds for tea. That’s $60 for an afternoon snack. It’s more than what someone under 20 working at the UK minimum wage can expect to make in a day. In the outer reaches of London, populated by ethnic minorities who have long faced discrimination, even those jobs are hard to come by. The unemployment rate in areas of outer London can approach 16%.
Furthermore, for all the people lining up to buy $60 tea, this is not a city where money goes very far unless you have a lot of it. To give just one example, a single trip on the Tube, or subway, can cost 4 pounds. Add in the ethnic tensions that, for all its multicultural nature, permeate London, and the result is a toxic mix. While that mix happened to explode this weekend, it is one that has long festered in a gradual but equally harmful way.
While the recent upsurge in crime will probably, hopefully, fade away soon as police battle to restore order to these streets, the underlying problem will remain. It’s a problem that cannot be solved overnight, but until the U.K. comes to terms with its far-reaching social issues, violence of this sort will continue to boil over every now and again, a reminder that the disenfranchised need a voice too.

Red meat consumption, especially in a processed form, is linked to an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, according to a study released Wednesday from the Harvard School of Public Health.
The research team found that one daily serving of 100 grams of unprocessed red meat accounted for a 19 percent increase in risk of developing diabetes, and a 50 gram serving of processed meat, which includes foods like hot dogs, sausages, and bacon, was linked with a whopping 51 percent increase in risk.
With 350 million adults worldwide affected by diabetes—25.6 million of them in the United States alone—the researchers advised the public to limit their consumption of red meat, especially processed red meat.
“We should eradicate [processed meats] from our diets,” said lead study author An Pan, citing the high level of sodium and nitrates in unprocessed meat that can increase risk of insulin resistance. “Unprocessed, people should allowed to have one or two servings per week. That’s fine.”
The study, which was published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, also found that substitution of healthier proteins for red meat had significant health benefits. For example, substituting one serving of low-fat dairy for red meat leads to a 17 percent lower risk of developing diabetes. Similar benefits were observed for nuts and whole grains, with a 21 percent and 23 percent reduction in risk, respectively.
“I think the study conclusion could be to replace red meat with white meat. Consider nuts, soybeans, and other sources of protein,” said co-author Qi Sun. “That is the key message this paper is delivering to the public.”
The study is one of the largest and most comprehensive of its kind, following 442,101 participants—28,228 of whom eventually developed type 2 diabetes—for up to 28 years across both long-term studies of health professionals and existing data sets from other studies.
It is one of the first studies to identify an increased risk for diabetes from both processed and unprocessed red meats. It is also one of the first to quantify health benefits from substitution of other protein sources.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A tumultuous spate of violent rioting and looting in Great Britain this past week has shaken many in the Greater London area, as well as Harvard affiliates working, studying, and teaching in London.
Fifteen undergraduates are studying at a Harvard Summer School program in University College London this summer.
Deirde L. Barrett, the program director and an assistant clinical professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School, said she has been following media coverage of the rioting “to make sure nobody went out at night to areas that were unsafe.”
More than 1,200 people have been arrested in connection with the riots, which stemmed from the fatal police shooting of 29-year-old Mark Duggan on August 4 in Tottenham, an area within Greater London.
Two nights later, some 200 community members marched on the police station, protesting the handling of the shooting. The initially peaceful protest eventually devolved into a riot, sparking looting, arson, and violence in cities across the nation in subsequent days.
Barrett said they have witnessed isolated signs of citizen unrest nearby. Looters attempted to break into a computer store half a block away from the undergraduates’ classrooms, for example.
But the students have not been heavily affected, as the University College London campus is located far from the epicenter of the riots.
Overall, most students have felt “pretty disconnected” from the riots, according to program participant Katherine M. Agard ’13.
“Shops closed earlier than usual. The Tube is a bit more of a mess. But in this area, people have been generally going on about their life as usual,” she said. “It's pretty easy to avoid the areas where rioting has been going on.”
Agard added that many students have been studying for their final exams instead of watching the news or going out in the city.
“Some people weren't really sure of why the riots had started, or the greater social implications of the rioting,” she said. “To some extent, we exist in our Harvard bubble of finals and papers, just like in Cambridge.”
Harvard Summer School authorities said that they have been in contact with the program participants.
"The students are not living or studying near the major riot areas of the past few nights," Elisabeth "Lisa" L. Laskin, associate dean for academic affairs at the Summer School, said in an email sent by a spokesperson on Wednesday. "They are in the final week of their program, which is an exam tomorrow, and a paper due next Tuesday. But they have been given lots of guidance by the program director, including just to stay in."
Closer to the center of the rioting is Schuyler A. Milender ’13, who has been living in London for the duration of her summer internship. Stores in her neighborhood of Walthamstow have been subject to looting, and she said she has made sure to return home before dark every night.
Characterizing the past few days in London as “both terrifying and awe-inspiring,” Milender said that her sense of alarm has gradually begun to dissipate.
“Whereas I expected to feel constantly fearful and anxious to return to the US, I instead have felt more connected to London this weekend than I have throughout the entire duration of my summer,” she wrote in an email to The Crimson. “I feel a surprising sense of solidarity with the people here.”
Milender said she was struck by the compassion and unity the city has shown in the face of the disturbances. Emerging from a train station on Wednesday to a large crowd, Milender said she was initially fearful that she had stepped right into a riot.
In fact, she was in the presence of several church groups, who had gathered to sing and advocate for the importance of claiming back the community and protecting city streets.
“I feel like I saw both the best and the worst of what London has to offer over the past 5 days, and I am strangely thankful to have been here to witness these events,” Milender said. “The riots have given me a true glimpse into the racial and socioeconomic tensions in London, but maybe more importantly, into the thoughts and convictions of the people during a time of crisis.”
