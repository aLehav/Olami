After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My mother frequently told me that at every age she thought she had the world figured out, but as she got older, she realized how little she knew.
I was deeply nervous that I would be guilty of the same pretension. The trick I had up my sleeve was that she had told me this at a young age. Since I was aware of my ignorance, I wasn’t ignorant at all. I would tell myself, “Oh Spencer, you know so little,” in the front of my consciousness, but a little deeper down I would say, “Of course, since you are aware of that, you’re far ahead of your age.”
Such a realization is necessary, but it can be paralyzing. What can we do in this infinite cycle of ignorance and arrogance? How can we emerge with any claim toward a better understanding of the truth and toward becoming more mature people without a simultaneous nullification of our whole endeavor toward knowledge?
We must cede some of our epistemological autonomy. There are two ways to approach an old text: we can either look at it and find one thing that is heinous or stupid and then dismiss the whole endeavor, or we can presume that there is something wise in it and then take the burden upon ourselves to discover what that nugget of wisdom is. If we assume our own correctness and simply look at history, literature, philosophy, and religion to confirm our priors, we have utterly failed.
I once heard a story that a prominent rabbi was on a plane sitting next to an evolutionary biologist. His grandchildren kept running back and forth, asking him, “Can we get you anything?” and “Are you alright, Grandpa?” The eagerness of the rabbi’s grandchildren to help their elder perplexed the professor. Most kids nowadays, he thought, are caught up with their personalized entertainment and are far more inclined to make demands on their parents than to offer assistance.
So he asked the rabbi, “Why is it that your grandchildren keep coming over here? How did you raise them differently?”
“Ahhh,” said the rabbi. “In your field, you teach that each generation gets better. They are smarter, morally superior, more evolved. In my religion, we believe that each generation gets further and further away from the revelation of the Torah, so they cling onto me as a vestige of that which has been lost.”
While this story may be apocryphal, it embodies the stark difference between the religious attitude toward knowledge and that expounded by modern science. However, the attitude expressed by the rabbi doesn’t mean that we don’t understand math or science better than we did a thousand years ago; nor does it mean that we can’t make moral progress in society. Rather, the Jewish concept of yeridas hadoros (literally “descent of generations”) emphasizes that as each generation passes, we are further from the original Revelation at Sinai  — but at the same time, each subsequent generation is elevated because they are closer to the final redemption.
This is all to say that we need to look back for wisdom and knowledge of the truth, but look forward for character development and social improvement. We can change as individuals and as a society, but we must be humble in that process, understanding that there are many people far more intelligent and more thoughtful than us who contributed ideas necessary for that process of improvement.
We are on Earth for a pretty short time, and we use vanishingly little of it to learn things.  In arguing that we should look back for knowledge, I don’t mean to say that our parents or grandparents are exponentially closer to the truth than we are. In fact, they could be just as ignorant. However, we must treat previous generations with reverence rather than contempt. They have had a lot of time to think about the world, and we must not dismiss their writings because there were morally reprehensible political movements contemporaneous with them. There are morally reprehensible political movements in our time; should our greatest thinkers be cast off for being in their era?
We must always attempt to read and to learn with the attitude that “I know practically nothing, and this person has at least one thing to teach me.” Self-recognition of our own ignorance should not lead to hopelessness regarding our own education. It must be an imperative towards an endless quest for knowledge.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In August of 1933, a 65-year-old, heavy-hearted W.E.B. Du Bois, Class of 1890, founder and editor of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People’s magazine, “the Crisis,” published an article titled “The Negro College.” In it, Du Bois expressed a radical commitment to exclusively-Black education in the face of Jim Crow, a fierce declaration that would get him into a lot of trouble, both with his readers and the NAACP’s leadership.
In fact, the following summer, the conflict would lead to his resignation.
Du Bois begins the essay by criticizing Black educators who insist that a Black college is  “nothing more and nothing less than a university.” No, Du Bois, writes. Stop assimilating. They are Black universities. For Du Bois, to advocate against race-consciousness in historically Black institutions of learning naively assumed an inevitable racial progress in the Jim Crow Era. Instead, America needed these colleges to prepare Black students for the real world, such that they could learn “exactly how and where…to establish a reasonable Life in the United States.”
Du Bois’ readers correctly understood him to be advocating for segregation. At this point in his life, he had begun to cope with racism’s permanence in the industrial system. Du Bois had his share of education, graduating from Fisk University in 1888, earning a second bachelor’s from Harvard in 1890, and five years later, in 1895, becoming the first African American to receive a PhD from Harvard. He spent the majority of his adult life fighting for integration through both academia and journalism, trying to convince whites that Blacks were worthy of their support. And still, it seemed like segregation in the educational system was only solidifying.
The only viable alternative was to pivot inwards. Black people, through “voluntary determined cooperative effort,” would have to establish their own Black institutions in their own communities. With great time and effort, they would fight their way back into a diverse American public sphere.
Du Bois’ dreary vision of racial separation in 1933 is darkly prophetic, perhaps. It is the world Students for Fair Admissions wants.
This October, the Supreme Court took up Students for Fair Admissions v. President and Fellows of Harvard College, a landmark case challenging Harvard’s race-conscious admissions. Using the classic white supremacist move — pitting minorities against one another — SFFA asserts that Harvard’s race-conscious admissions “penalizes Asian Americans” for the undue benefit of African American and Latinx applicants. Such a conniving conservative argument (“race-conscious admissions are reverse racism!”) is just another instance of white supremacy wagging its unwieldy head, calling discriminatory a measure designed to correct the discrimination that white supremacists themselves have perpetuated.
If affirmative action is overturned, Harvard’s percentage of Black and Latinx students may shrink into non-existence, particularly impacting Generational African Americans, who are already estimated to be severely underrepresented at the University. Institutional bias will go unchecked and the admissions office’s preference for legacy students will only strengthen. Harvard admissions, the so-called colorblind institution SFFA dreams of, will increasingly shatter the dreams of Black and Latinx high school applicants.
If SFFA gets what it wants, what Du Bois called the “Color Line” in education will only sharpen. Black and Latinx students will be forced to become increasingly conscious of their racial identities as they watch Harvard retrogress to its white racial status.
A few weeks ago, a large group of Black Harvard students traveled to Washington D.C. to celebrate an annual football game at “The Mecca,” that is, the illustrious Howard University. To be in an oasis of knowledge beyond the white gaze was a little taste of heaven. When we asked students about their experience, they had their trifles with administrative processes, as most of us do. But when it came to their racial identity, one thing was abundantly clear: at Howard, it felt easier to be authentic, to explore the intellectual and social world around you without having to be overly conscious of your skin color.
I didn’t apply to Howard in high school because I wasn’t aware of its importance. The alienation I have experienced on Harvard’s campus has made that importance abundantly clear. Black students on this campus are tired of being looked at sideways when we self-congregate. We are tired of the fact that there is no physical space for us on campus. We are tired of the fact that to fit in, we must assimilate into white final clubs. We are tired of so-called “progressive” answers in the classroom that sound woke but lack substance.
Almost 90 years after “The Negro College” was published, we wrestle with the temptation to retrogress to separate schooling: a dystopian America where droves of Black students stop applying to white schools and turn to Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Where elite institutions are further deprived of the gift that is diversity.
I would hope that the onset of such a segregated world is unlikely. But if that is the world that Students for Fair Admissions want, then so be it.
Howard, here we come!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Read The Crimson’s complete election night roundup here.
BOSTON — Maura T. Healey ’92 will become the first female governor of Massachusetts after defeating her Republican opponent, Geoffrey G. Diehl, according to a projection by the Associated Press.
Follow live election night updates below.
Incumbent Democrat Ayanna S. Pressley won re-election to her third term in Congress for the Seventh District. She garnered nearly 85 percent of the vote, beating out Republican opponent Donnie Palmer.
Katherine Clark, a Democrat who represents Cambridge in the House, beat out opponent Caroline Colarusso for the Fifth District.
Amid shouts of “Don’t concede” and “Every vote counts,” Diehl conceded the state's top post to Healey in a speech around 11 p.m.
Diehl's concession came roughly three hours after the Associated Press called the race for his opponent.
In his speech, Diehl affirmed the legitimacy of the election and urged voters who had supported him and his running mate Leah Allen to respect Healey's win.
"The people of the Commonwealth have spoken," he said. "I respect their choice, and I ask everyone who supported me and Leah to give her the same opportunity for success that I would have asked if the shoe had been on the other foot."
He called on Healey's administration to adopt "a more reasonable timeline for achieving energy goals" and to approach tax policy with caution.
"Though our campaign ends today, the work to create a better Massachusetts doesn’t end," Diehl said.
The Associated Press called the state attorney general race for Campbell shortly after 11 p.m.
Campbell's success against Republican attorney James McMahon makes her the first Black woman elected to statewide office in Massachusetts history. The win comes only hours after Healey, the outgoing attorney general, became the first woman and first openly gay candidate elected as the state's governor.
Democrat Andrea J. Campbell declared victory in the race for state attorney general at around 10:25 p.m.
The Associated Press has not yet called the race.
Campbell would be the first Black woman to hold statewide office in Massachusetts.
“Massachusetts, I am humbled and honored to be with you to celebrate this history-making night,” she said, claiming victory over Republican James McMahon.
“For those who have felt unseen, this victory is for you. For those who have felt marginalized, this victory is for you. For those who have felt left out, left behind, this victory is for you,” she said.
“Women will truly lead Massachusetts forward, and it’s about damn time,” she said.
Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) addressed supporters and thanked organizers at around 10 p.m. Tuesday.
“Massachusetts is home to the greatest force of grassroots organizers in America,” he said.
Massachusetts Democrats enthusiastically chanted “Maura” as Healey took the stage after 9:30 p.m. Tuesday.
“I want you to know I’ll be a governor for everyone, and I’ll work with anyone who’s up for making a difference in this state,” she said.
Healey said her victory sends a message to the nation.
“Tonight I want to say something to every little girl and every LGBTQ person out there. I hope tonight shows you that you can be whatever, whoever you want to be.”
“I stand in front of you tonight proud to be the first woman and first gay person ever elected governor of Massachusetts,” she said.
Diehl has not yet conceded the race.
Salem Mayor Kim Driscoll addressed supporters around 9:30 p.m., accepting her victory in the race for Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor.
“Hey Massachusetts, tonight we made history,” she said. “Actually, we made her story.”
Driscoll expressed her excitement to serve on Beacon Hill alongside Healey.
“I cannot wait to be your teammate, Maura,” she said.
According to Driscoll, she will be the first Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor ever to be a public college graduate.
Boston Mayor Michelle Wu ’07 lauded Healey in a speech to supporters at around 9 p.m.
“Tonight, in Massachusetts, we have shattered the highest glass ceiling,” she said.
Congresswoman Ayanna S. Pressley, who is projected to win her third term tonight, told the crowd “change is on its way.”
“Tonight’s results are because of good old hard work. Work women have been doing for generations,” she said.
Representative Katherine M. Clark, who represents Cambridge in the House, came on stage to celebrate Healey.
“There is no better point guard for building a better future for tomorrow than Maura Healey,” she said.
Maura T. Healey ’92 coasted past her Trump-backed Republican opponent in the Massachusetts gubernatorial election Tuesday, becoming the first woman elected to the state’s top job.
The Associated Press called the race for Healey at 8 p.m. on Tuesday, right after polls closed.
Healey will also be the first openly gay candidate to take up the post.
She is the third straight Harvard College alumni to be elected governor. Six of the last seven people elected governor of the state have held a degree from Harvard University.
Healey, who handily out-fundraised Geoffrey G. Diehl, has flipped the state blue after Republican Charlie D. Baker ’79, who chose not to run for re-election, has held the office for eight years.
Supporters gathered in downtown Boston at the Fairmont hotel to watch the election results come in, buzzing with energy in anticipation of an easy victory.
Clifton Braithwaite, from Boston, said that he is excited “to break ground history.”
“I wasn’t a part of the tea party, but you know we’re rebels here in Massachusetts,” Braithwaite said.
Melody Callahan, a supporter at the downtown watch party, said she has long backed Healey.
“I have been raising money for Maura for eight years, before she even decided to run for governor," Callahan said. "I believe in everything she stands for."
“Charlie has done a wonderful job but she’s going to be an even better governor,” her husband Dennis Callahan added.
At the Lexington Avenue Fire House polling location in Cambridge, voters voiced concerns about the future of American democracy.
Michael W. Yogman, a Cambridge pediatrician and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, said the midterms mark "a pretty scary time for this country" and could empower "a sweep of people who don’t believe in democracy, who think that votes that are legitimately cast are not valid."
“It puts every minority at risk," he added.
Raymond Traietti, Director of Memorial Hall, said he is most worried about the outcomes of local races across the country for positions in charge of election administration.
“Election denial is a dangerous thing,” Traietti said, adding that elective democracy is “all we’ve got.”
Jakov Kucan, a software engineer in Cambridge, said he feels people are consuming information that is “open to manipulation,” including by foreign actors.
“The United States being a democratic country, I don’t think we should be taking it for granted,” he said. “I think it’s on the verge of collapsing as being a democratic country and turning into a dictatorship.”
“I don’t think that’s a given outcome, but it’s a possibility,” Kucan added. “That’s why we should go and vote, to make sure that does not happen.”
Cambridge voter Kathleen Garvey said she likes Healey, but wishes the attorney general had been “a little more present” during her campaign.
“I wish she was out there a little more,” Garvey said. “I don’t feel like she really ran.”
Kucan said that while he has appreciated the “healthy tension” and “checks and balances” created by a Republican governor in a generally blue state, he looks forward to Healey's term as governor.
“I think she has a pulse on the population of Massachusetts,” Kucan said. “I’m excited about having her as a governor.”
Here are the key races on Tuesday's ballot in Massachusetts:
Governor: Attorney General Maura T. Healey ’92 appears poised to be elected as the first female governor in Massachusetts history. She held a heavy polling lead over her Trump-backed Republican opponent, Geoffrey G. Diehl, going into Election Day
Ballot Questions: Massachusetts voters will decide the fate of a recently passed state law that would allow undocumented immigrants to obtain driver’s licenses today. Voters will also weigh in on an amendment to the state constitution that would create a “millionaire’s tax” for Massachusetts’ top earners and exclusively allocate the increased revenue toward education and public transportation. If passed, the amendment would impose a 4 percent tax on annual incomes above $1 million.
Auditor: The race for state auditor could be the Republicans’ best chance to put up a fight today. Democrat Diana DiZoglio is facing Republican Anthony Amore, the only GOP nominee endorsed Massachusetts' popular outgoing governor, Charlie D. Baker ’79.
Congress: All nine Democrats who represent Massachusetts in the U.S. House are considered safe in their re-election campaigns, even as the party's slim majority in the chamber appears to be in jeopardy. Neither of the state's two senators are on the ballot.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Draped in Brazilian flags and holding signs alleging fraud, more than 100 protesters gathered in Harvard Square Sunday to oppose the results of the Brazilian presidential election.
Leftist leader Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva won the Oct. 30 election with 50.9 percent of the vote, replacing far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro, who garnered 49.1 percent after serving one term in office. Protests have erupted across Brazil and the United States, with some Bolsonaro supporters alleging the election was fraudulent and calling on the military to stop the transition of power.
There is no evidence to suggest the election was illegitimate. Brazilian military officials, who helped supervise the election, said they have not found any signs of voter fraud.
Sunday’s protest was organized by Congresso Conservador Brasileiro, a conservative Brazilian group based in Framingham.
The protesters questioned the integrity of electronic voting machines, through which nearly all Brazilian voters cast their ballots.
A group of Harvard students counter-protested Sunday’s demonstration, calling the display an attack on democracy.
João Pinheiro ’23-’24 and Helena Mello Franco ’24, co-presidents of the Harvard Undergraduate Brazilian Association, said the organization did not condone the Bolsonaro supporters’ actions.
“It's an attack against democratic values — an attack against the electoral system in Brazil,” Pinheiro said.
“We also felt like it was an invasion of our space as well to have these protesters here in the middle of Harvard Square, many times confusing the students at Harvard who could be thinking that these people were affiliated somehow with us,” said Mello Franco, who attended the counter-protest.
Mello Franco described Sunday’s counter-protest, which was not organized by HUBA, as a demonstration in support of democratic institutions.
“The protest was not necessarily pro-Lula,” Mello Franco said. “I think the protest is more accurately described as a protest pro-‘respect electoral results and democratic institutions.’”
Lula, who is set to take office at the start of next year, previously served as president of Brazil from 2003 to 2010. In July 2017, he was convicted on charges of money laundering and corruption and sentenced to nine and a half years in prison. Brazil’s Supreme Court annulled Lula’s sentence in March 2021, and he was released after spending 580 days in prison.
At Sunday’s demonstration, protester Fatima Heath said she was “upset” that someone who was previously imprisoned was elected president of Brazil.
“We don't want a bad guy,” Heath said. “If the left [has] another good guy, we will respect. We will respect it, because we support the democracy.”
Heath, along with several other protesters at the event, advocated for military intervention in Brazil.
“We want, we call, we need, we ask for our army [to] resolve that,” Heath said.
Pinheiro, HUBA co-president, drew comparisons between Sunday’s protest and attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 US presidential election.
Mello Franco said she hoped Sunday’s demonstrations would shed light on Brazil’s political climate, which she described as “polarizing.”
“I hope that in a way this event also makes people more conscious of how important it is right now to support Brazilian democracy and to leads fights to make sure that democracy is upheld — that the results are upheld,” she said.
Mello Franco also called for compassion toward Brazilian students.
“Try to be as comforting and as compassionate as possible because it's very tough for us to see something like this happening to our democracy and with us being so far away from it as well,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Federal judge David R. Stras reflected on his grandparents’ experience in the Holocaust and its implications for the First Amendment at a Harvard Law School lecture Tuesday afternoon.
The event, co-sponsored by the Harvard chapter of the Federalist Society and the Harvard Jewish Law Students Association, featured Stras — an Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals judge — recounting his grandparents’ experiences in the Auschwitz concentration camp.
Stras described stories he was told by his grandfather before launching into a discussion of freedom of speech ensured by the First Amendment. During the talk, Stras shared both an emotional reflection on his Jewish identity and an intellectual discussion around law.
“I’ve come to realize though that their stories have done more than just affect me personally. They become part of who I am and how I view the world around me,” Stras said. “To a certain extent, they have also shaped my judging, too, and why I school so firmly to my first principles — those core beliefs that shape how I approach the law.”
Stras emphasized throughout the lecture that his grandparents’ stories have invaluable lessons for sustaining free societies, such as allowing the unrestrained expression of religion and beliefs.
“The point is that if we decide the government can prohibit offensive speech, speech is not really free anymore,” Stras said.
“No one here is a number, with or without tattoos,” he added, referring to the numbers tattooed to his grandparents’ arms during the Holocaust. “Our values may be different, our beliefs worlds apart — and still the government has no right to tell us what to say or what to believe.”
Stras said society has become increasingly intolerant to “listening to ideas you don’t agree with.”
“My grandfather taught me that as important as it is to defend your own beliefs, it is equally important to listen closely to what other people have to say,” he said.
Stras also discussed Supreme Court rulings on the First Amendment that he believes support his views on freedom of speech.
“As the Supreme Court has put, the bedrock principle of free speech is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society itself finds the idea offensive or disagreeable,” Stras said.
Leaders of the Harvard organizations sponsoring the lecture said they supported the Stras’ message.
Ethan C. Harper, president of HFS, said he agreed with Stras’ emphasis on the importance of preserving freedoms — a principle he said is imperative to maintaining open, productive dialogue among people with varying beliefs and backgrounds.
“We’re all trying to make the world a better place. We might disagree on how to get there, but that discussion and the act and the process of actually going through that really matters in terms of having a functioning democracy,” he said.
JLSA co-president Ari A. Spitzer wrote in an emailed statement that the talk fits into his organization’s overarching goal, which is “to support and promote Jewish life on campus” by providing students with diverse perspectives from Jewish professionals.
“From the feedback I received, the audience seemed to enjoy the event and find the speech meaningful,” Spitzer wrote.
To conclude his speech, Stras quoted a 1979 talk given by his grandfather about the social responsibility of garnering awareness about the Holocaust.
“You question yourself, ‘Why did I survive? Why?’ All of a sudden life is a struggle again. Who can you complain to?” Stras recited. “We, the survivors, have to let the world know that we will never again allow another Holocaust. All of you here in this room — may I call you my friends — we must speak up and let the world know that we are proud of our heritage.”
Sharing stories such as those of his grandfather, Stras said, is fundamental to the First Amendment’s tenet of freedom of expression and to ensuring Holocaust victims are memorialized.
“It is important not only that we remember the words ‘never again,’ but that we never forget what my grandparents and people like him went through,” he said. “I remember grandpa and I will never forget.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Legal experts and scholars discussed the use of data from menstrual tracking applications in courtrooms in the wake of the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision at a Harvard Law School abortion and digital rights panel on Tuesday.
Harvard Law School Clinical Instructor Alejandra L. Caraballo, who teaches at the school’s Cyberlaw Clinic, moderated the panel of technological and legal experts who commented on the history of criminalizing abortion and the emerging implications of online medical data.
Civil rights lawyer Cynthia Conti-Cook, who serves as a Technology Fellow at the Ford Foundation, said, considering the current age in which third parties like Facebook Messenger have access to vast amounts of data, individuals need to think more critically about the means and extent to which they share their personal information online.
“It’s something that we all have to start paying attention to, not just in the context of protecting ourselves and our autonomy and reproductive health, but for many different reasons — to protect who we love, and protect how we want to die, and how we want to be treated by healthcare professionals,” Conti-Cook said.
Yveka Pierre, Senior Litigation Counsel for nonprofit organization If/When/How: Lawyering for Reproductive Justice, explained how data from menstrual cycle tracking apps could be used in court cases. Instead of monitoring all users, prosecutors are more likely to build their case using data from a tracking app after the woman is accused of having an illegal abortion, Pierre said.
“The way that is likely to be used is: your phone is taken away, your laptop, your tablet, whatever — and then someone is able to get access to that app and say, ‘Look, Judge, she knew she was pregnant because she tracked her last period to be that day — and that’s how she knows she was at that gestational age, we can move forward with the prosecution for that reason,’” she said.
Panelist Kate Bertash of the Harvard Law School Cyberlaw Clinic said that “just being aware of the footprint that’s generated can help us act differently.”
Pierre cited the Hyde Amendment — a post-Roe v. Wade, pre-Dobbs legislation that banned the use of federal funds to cover abortion services — as an example of how disinterest in racially and socioeconomically disadvantaged women fosters ignorance of previous abortion access limitations.
“There’s part of us that needs to navigate through why the sympathetic character is a white woman in her 30s with her blonde daughter or her brunette daughter in these ads,” Pierre said of mainstream abortion activism that followed the overturning of Roe in June. “It’s not folks that are more likely to be criminalized.”
Harvard Law School administrator Emily R. Neill, who attended the panel, said the event reaffirmed the need to reevaluate portrayals of who is criminalized by anti-abortion laws.
Neill said recent public outrage “ignores a long, long history of entrapping and ensnaring for women of color.”
Bertash said that collective advocacy can make it possible to ensure protection for those seeking reproductive health care access and those offering services.
“When you are actually pregnant and giving birth is another time that you're incredibly policed,” she said. “All of these people, if we bring ourselves together, make singular demands of these platforms, and also policymakers, then we have those opportunities to make an impact.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students and affiliates flooded the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum Tuesday evening to await the results of the 2022 midterm elections at a watch party hosted by the Institute of Politics.
The watch party, moderated by former CNN anchor Brian Stelter, featured commentary from students in the IOP, as well as former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, a visiting fellow at the IOP this semester, and a guest speaker from Black Voters Matter, LaTosha Brown.
Shortly after polls closed in Massachusetts at 8 p.m., the Associated Press called the state’s gubernatorial race for Maura T. Healey ’92. Election results from states across the country also began to roll in.
Tarina K. Ahuja ’24, a member of the IOP, said she was nervous about the “big elections” in Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Arizona, which could flip party control of the U.S. House and Senate.
“There are a couple of states that have come in, but I think the ones that we’ve seen so far are the things that we’ve been expecting,” she said. “I’m just holding on to see what happens with all of the ones that are kind of up in the air still.”
Even as the viewing party came to a close at 10 p.m., results from many states remained uncertain.
Nahla C. Owens ’25, who hails from Georgia and Texas, two states with key races in this election cycle, said the midterm elections would have been “terrifying to watch alone.”
“I’m really grateful for the watch parties that are happening both with Dems and IOP and having spaces to react with people together,” she said.
“I think a lot of students who are Democrats came into this maybe not with the highest of hopes, understanding that there were seats that we were going to lose,” she added. “But I feel like there's just so much energy in this room that the optimism is rising as the night goes along.”
Eunice S. Chon ’25, an independent voter from Georgia, said she expects the race to end in favor of incumbent Governor Brian P. Kemp.
“My home state is GA, which is a key swing state this midterm election season,” she wrote in a statement. “I’m pretty sure that the governor’s race isn’t that close. Kemp will win.”
Chon said the midterm elections revealed the nation’s hyperpolarization and highlighted the differences in priorities between parties.
“Democrats fought hard on abortion and protecting our democracy. Republicans focused on inflation and economic frustrations,” she wrote. “Neglecting any of these issues was a sure-fire way to seem out of touch.”
After hours of watching the polls, students — along with the rest of the country — are still waiting for final results to come in.
Luke D. M. Albert ’22, co-president of the Harvard College Democrats, urged voters to “let the democratic process take place and ensure it’s taking place without being interfered with.”
“We’re all anxious, of course, but we’re balancing hope and balancing fear together,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Harvard-led team of researchers found the Omicron BA.2 subvariant — the Covid-19 strain currently dominant in the United States — appears to have a lower mortality rate than previous strains of the virus, per an article published by the Journal of the American Medical Association last month.
The study, published on Oct. 25, was led by Harvard Medical School instructor Zachary H. Strasser and included researchers from HMS, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Minerva University. The study found that the Omicron BA.2 subvariant has a mortality rate of 0.3 percent — less than half of the Delta variant’s 0.7 percent mortality rate.
“The results suggest that the BA.2 lineage has become intrinsically less severe than that of the original Omicron variant and the Delta variant,” the authors wrote in the paper.
To compare the mortality rates of different Covid-19 strains, the researchers used entropy balance — a statistical method which allowed the team to control for various patient conditions, such as vaccination or prior infection.
“We want to compare patients that have been treated in the same way so that we can really understand the severity difference,” Strasser said.
The researchers also considered the impacts of potential confounding variables — such as patient comorbidities and prior infections — according to Shawn N. Murphy, a professor at HMS who co-authored the study.
“People have all been vaccinated now, they have had prior infections, and we did adjust for all those different factors and treatments,” Murphy said.
Though the results of the study suggest a decreasing pattern in the strength of Covid-19, Strasser said the trajectory of the virus remains unclear.
“We're just looking at really three strains, but at least among these three strains, it seems like the variants are becoming weaker,” Strasser said. “But that doesn't necessarily mean that the trend is going to continue.”
Strasser cautioned against making broad inferences about the virus from this study.
“There might be an inclination to look at this data and say that this means that Covid is going away or that it's becoming less severe, but really it's just three data points, three variants,” Strasser added. “It's good news, and hopefully it continues, but it doesn't necessarily mean that it has to.”
Strasser said his team hopes to conduct future studies using electronic health record data to examine the long-term effects of Covid-19, particularly on patients who suffer from severe cases of the virus.
“One of the advantages of the electronic health record is that you can capture longitudinal data,” he said. “That is advantageous when you're thinking about something like long Covid and wanting to look at what happens to a patient over time.”
“We're going to be focusing more on long Covid going forward,” Strasser said.

BOSTON — Democrat Maura T. Healey ’92 coasted to victory in the Massachusetts gubernatorial election Tuesday, easily downing a Trump-backed opponent to become the first woman ever elected to the state’s top post.
Healey, who will become the first openly lesbian governor in American history, is the third consecutive Harvard College alum elected governor of Massachusetts. She dominated Republican Geoffrey G. Diehl, who conceded just before 11 p.m. Tuesday.
“I stand in front of you tonight proud to be the first woman and first gay person ever elected governor of Massachusetts,” Healey told a crowd of jubilant supporters at a hotel in Boston, where she declared victory at around 9:30 p.m. Tuesday.
Healey’s victory flips the Massachusetts governor’s seat blue again after eight years of GOP leadership under Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79, who opted not to seek a third term.
Healey and Lieutenant Governor-Elect Kimberley Driscoll led a slate of Democratic female candidates that made history on Tuesday.
“Tonight I want to say something to every little girl and every LGBTQ person out there: I hope tonight shows you that you can be whatever, whoever you want to be,” Healey said.
The Associated Press called the race within seconds of when polls closed at 8 p.m. Tuesday. Diehl’s campaign manager, Amanda Orlando, condemned the early projection, calling it “irresponsible.” But trailing in every Massachusetts county, Diehl conceded just hours later.
“The people of the commonwealth have spoken,” he said in a monotone address to supporters at a watch party late Tuesday. “I respect their choice.”
Former Boston City Councilor Andrea J. Campbell became the first Black woman elected to a statewide office Tuesday after she easily defeated her Republican opponent in the race for Massachusetts attorney general.
“In Massachusetts we don’t just say representation matters, we are showing it,” she said during a victory speech at the Democratic watch party in Boston.
Campbell’s victory over Republican James McMahon comes just over a year after she lost in a primary for mayor of Boston.
Massachusetts voters elected Democrats to every statewide office and maintained the party’s supermajority in the state legislature, securing its ironclad grip on state policymaking.
In the race for state auditor, Democrat Diana DiZoglio led Republican Anthony Amore, the lone statewide GOP nominee endorsed by Baker, as of early Wednesday morning. The Associated Press had not called the contest at press time.
William F. Galvin cruised to an eighth term as secretary of state on Tuesday, defeating Republican Rayla Campbell. State Treasurer Deborah B. Goldberg defeated Cristina Crawford to secure her third term in office.
Cambridge voters re-elected a slate of Democrats to the state legislature, helping shore up the party’s supermajority.
All nine Democrats who represent Massachusetts in the U.S. House were re-elected Tuesday, including both of Cambridge’s representatives, Ayanna S. Pressley and Katherine M. Clark.
At the state Democratic watch party, Healey supporters lauded her historic victory.
“I look forward to the future of Massachusetts with them in charge,” said Melody Callahan, of Charlestown.
Healey Volunteer Dawn McKenna, of Lexington, said she was “thrilled” to be at the event to celebrate victories by Healey and Campbell.
“I’ve gotten to know Andrea Campbell really well, she’s just a fantastic human being and will make a fantastic attorney general,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Political experts discussed the future of US-China relations following the 20th Party Congress of the Chinese Communist Party at a panel hosted by the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation and the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies on Tuesday.
During the session, titled “China’s New Politics: What have we learned from the 20th Party Congress,” panelists spoke about the state of China’s development, focusing on the nation’s maturing economy and geopolitical status as a world power.
Many of the experts also criticized current US foreign policy, calling it too uniformly hostile, and encouraged greater cooperation in economics and climate change.
“I’m really discouraged by the Biden administration,” said Joseph Fewsmith, a political science professor at Boston University and center associate at Harvard’s Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies.
“We used to have over a hundred official dialogues with China during the Obama administration. Right at the moment, we have absolutely zero,” he said. “It’s certainly better to talk than to not talk.”
The panel also featured Lucy Hornby, journalist and Fairbank Center visiting scholar; Anthony Saich, a Harvard Kennedy School professor of international affairs; and Yuhua Wang, a Harvard professor of government. Mark Wu, a Harvard Law School professor and director of the Fairbank Center, moderated the event.
The panel discussed the CCP’s Party Congress, which occurred last month in Beijing. China’s dominant political party convenes the week-long conference every five years to determine leadership positions and changes to the party’s constitution. The meeting — which includes a report from Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CCP and China’s president — serves to outline the party’s “vision and direction,” Wu explained.
Xi’s statement was an “anxious report, full of anxiety and fears” that highlighted the party’s movement towards economic and political “risk mitigation” in light of China’s recent stagnating economic growth and the war in Ukraine, according to Saich.
“It’s a kind of defensive reaction, both domestically but also internationally,” he said.
The Party Congress captured global attention when Hu Jintao, former Chinese president and former general secretary of the CCP, was physically escorted from the meeting hall. Hornby said Hu’s removal was not as dramatic as it appeared.
“I think journalists particularly like the idea of factions battling it out because we try to make Chinese politics as interesting as we possibly can when nothing actually changes for five years,” Hornby said.
The 20th Party Congress also broke with some long-held norms. They did not elect any women to the Politburo, and Xi, 69, was elected despite the informal retirement age of 68. Most notably, Xi was elected for a historic third term as secretary general.
Still, the conference did not contain many surprises, according to the experts.
Fewsmith said he had expected Xi to dominate the Party Congress — which he said is “normal” for Chinese politics.
Then, pointing above to “New China,” the headline of the event displayed on a digital screen, Fewsmith added, “With all due respect to your title, it’s not what’s new about politics: It’s what’s old. This is a return to old politics.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s and men’s fencing teams got off to a hot start in last weekend's season-opening meets. Both teams traveled to the Air Force Academy in Colorado to compete in the Air Force Western Invitational on Saturday and Sunday. The men won six out of its seven matches in the Rockies, while the women went undefeated across eight matches.
After a phenomenal season last year, in which it put up a 13-4 record and finished second in the NCAA Championships, the men's team showed that it is still the team to beat.
On the first day of the invitational, the Crimson went 4-1 against University of Incarnate Word, University of North Carolina, Stanford, Ohio State, and University of California-San Diego.
It began the day with a 23-4 win over the University of Incarnate Ward, with three wins each from sophomore foils Andrew Chung and James Liao, senior sabre Mitchell Saron, and senior captain and foil Kenji Bravo.
In their second match of the day, the men defeated the University of North Carolina 22-5, with the foil and sabre squads going 8-1. Then, the Crimson overcame Stanford, 18-9, with another standout performance from the sabre team.
In its penultimate match of the day, Harvard suffered its first setback of the season at the hands of the Buckeyes, who edged out a 14-13 victory. However, the Crimson was undeterred, bouncing back strong in its final match by dispatching UCSD, 19-8.
The team picked up where it had left off on Sunday with a 22-5 win over New Jersey Institute of Technology. In that matchup, Bravo and senior Filip Dolegiewicz captured three wins each in foil and sabre, respectively.
The men then faced Ivy League rival Colombia in a scrimmage that ended up being its closest match. Impressive wins in the sabre squad from Dolegiewicz, senior Jason Oh, and Saron secured Harvard’s 15-12 win.
The final match of the tournament further showcased the Crimson’s dominance, as the team earned a 17-10 win over Air Force. Led by Chung and senior sabre Daniel Solomon, who each had three victories, Harvard closed out the invitational on a high note.
Overall, the foil team was particularly dominant, racking up an 8-0 record in the Invitational. Bravo led the pack, winning 21 out of his 22 matches. Dolegiewicz, the reigning men’s NCAA sabre champion, won all seven matches.
“The team has pretty much the same three goals at the beginning of every season,” Saron explained. “Win the Ivy League Championship, win the NCAA Championship, and third is to accomplish the first two while being the best-looking fencing team in the Division I circuit.”
With the whole team returning for the 2022-23 season, plus the addition of talented freshmen, Saron was optimistic that these goals will be accomplished.
“We lost to Colombia last year at the Ivy League Championship, and got to beat them this past weekend, which is great preparation for the upcoming Ivy League Championship in February,” he said. “We are also an extremely close team and are looking forward to accomplishing the goals we have set.”
The women’s undefeated performance was arguably even more dominant. Competing against University of Incarnate Word, University of North Carolina, Northwestern, Stanford, Ohio State, and University of California-San Diego in the first day of the invitational, the Crimson was only seriously challenged by the Cardinal.
Sophomore Lauren Scruggs, who won the 2021 Junior and Cadet World Fencing Championships in foil, led the way in the discipline, going undefeated in her 17 matches. Overall, the foil squad turned in an impressive performance, winning 46-8.
The Crimson remained undefeated throughout day two of the Invitational, capturing 21-6 victories over New Jersey Institute of Technology and Air Force.
Both the foil and sabre squads propelled the Crimson, going 8-1 in their matches against NJIT. The epee squad also came away with a 5-4 victory, led by sophomore Claire Beddington’s three wins.
First-year sabre Zoe Kim secured three wins against Air Force, adding to her 11 victories the previous day in what was a brilliant collegiate debut.
Overall, both teams have set the expectation high for the rest of the season and are looking to build upon a successful previous year. With unmatched top-end talent and improved depth, both Crimson squads appear ready to compete for national championships in February.
Looking forward, Harvard will travel to Chestnut Hill and compete at the Beanpot on Nov. 16. It will face Boston College, Brandeis University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Couldn’t decide whether you hate love psets or readings more? Can’t figure out how to combine all of your niche interests in one class? Want to learn R semi-proficiently in multiple different contexts? Here in the social sciences, you CAN have it all! Home to some of the largest concentrations at Harvard, the social sciences offer a choose-your-own-interdisciplinary adventure — read on to find out why our sophomores chose these concentrations for their own academic adventure!
Corinne E. Furey: I declared Social Studies because my hyperactive personality just. can’t. pick. one. This concentration’s interdisciplinary vibe allows me to bounce around various departments – now no one will ever get sick of me and I can always leave them wanting more <3. I eagerly await the thrill of sleepless nights spent thesis-ing senior year… and the party that will ensue upon my completion. I’ve truly loved my experience with the department thus far and am excited for so much more.
Stephany Gutierrez: I declared Government because my suffering through the Gov 20 readings last year needed to be justified. Besides, being surrounded by aspiring politicians who simultaneously seem to be doing the most and the bare minimum is fascinating. In all seriousness, GOV combines several disciplines like history and sociology, and for someone as indecisive as me, this flexibility is a necessity.
Hayeon “Rachel” Ok: I declared Economics after I took one look at my Stat 110 midterm and decided Stat was just not it, RIP. In semi-seriousness, I already had an interest in economics and I am already planning on becoming a finance gal/corporate girlie. Econ is just a good balance between writing (policy-related stuff) and dipping my toes into math/STEM. Although I will forever be shunned by my hard STEM blockmates for merely being in social sciences (and therefore cannot call myself a #WomanInSTEM), Econ is an interesting lens to view the world and provides a diversity of classes to explore my interests!
Quincy B. Donley: I think I’m declaring Economics! After taking about every intro class possible (okay not really, but I’ve taken a few), Ec10 has reeled me in. I’ve never been 100% certain about what I want to do, but this seems applicable to the ~real world~. And my young entrepreneurial self would appreciate the things I’m learning. Optimization, anyone? I’m starting the track a tiny bit late, but from what I can tell, Ec is pretty flexible in the sense that I can still fit some other non-concentration courses in there (hello study abroad?).
