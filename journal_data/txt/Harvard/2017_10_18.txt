After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In her new book, “The Burning Girl,” Claire Messud manages to capture a side of growing up that Judy Blume often fails to do. In this coming-of-age novel, Messud strikes the perfect balance between discussing the gracelessness of middle school and keeping the narrative from perpetual awkwardness. While many plotlines have vague endings, Messud’s book succeeds in being more thought-provoking than frustrating. Messud takes the common trope of the coming-of-age story and turns it into something fresh with her mature and truthful depictions of youth.
Many coming-of-age stories—full of awkwardness and puberty-talk for girls—revel in uncomfortable moments when the heroine is bullied, has her first period, or has her first kiss gone bad. However, this type of narrative often oversimplifies its characters: They rarely drink, curse, smoke, or take part in any sexual activity beyond kissing. Messud refuses to paint her character in such a naive light. She knows that many middle schoolers, shockingly, do indulge in these activities. Instead of avoiding them, she brings to light a difficult truth about the youth of today. Messud describes middle schoolers who, “If they weren’t partying, they wanted you to believe they were.” These children exist and the exposure of drugs and alcohol to kids as young as twelve presents another hurdle in the already difficult race to adulthood. Authors who write coming-of-age stories about adolescent girls tend to ignore this hurdle altogether, but Messud is not afraid to lift the veil and expose a truth.
Another way Messud’s novel differs from other bildungsromans is her focus. More often than not, such authors will bring up memories of puberty that evoke a time when no one was comfortable in her own skin. These are used, and overused, as a plot device to make the reader feel as awkward as the main character. But Messud did not write “The Burning Girl” to remind her readers of how everyone’s changing bodies made them strange. She wrote it to explain how it is possible to know someone well for a long time, but still lose the friendship in the end. While still a feeling that is characteristic of teenagerhood, when people outgrow their childhood best friends, losing a best friend has much more emotional depth than stuttering in front of a crush or forgetting your line in the school play. Although moments of discomfort appear in the novel, they carry an emotional weight much greater than the more obvious moments that other authors of similar novels include in their stories.
Open endings can be frustrating: Messud leaves many loose ends open to interpretation, but also helps the reader digest what has happened and what could happen to the characters. The main character ponders how she could have known her friend so well yet also not at all. She reflects “don’t know anything at all, except how the story should go, and we make believe it’s our story, hoping everything will turn out okay.” Important themes rise to the surface, from how and when people present their true selves to others, especially family members, to the point at which a friendship falls apart.
With a synopsis that promises “just another book“ about a girl figuring out herself and her body in her adolescence, Claire Messud manages to deliver a more mature and complex story than most like it, with an ending that makes one think, mentions of darker topics that truly affect children of middle school age, and a focus on relationships of depth rather than awkward incidents. Although not everyone has a best friend that went through what the heroine in “The Burning Girl” does, this novel still evokes the memory of a time when one’s skin was uncomfortable to live in and each person struggled to decide where in this world they fit in.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, in an address to a recent Faculty meeting, Undergraduate Council president Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 criticized a proposed ban on single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations. She did so without consulting other members of the body she leads about her remarks.
In our view, her actions were inappropriate. The student body should be represented by an individual able to present a disinterested view of the issue based on his or her understanding of undergraduate opinion. As Sachee is a member of the unrecognized Bee Club, her actions represented a conflict of interest between her responsibilities as an elected leader and as a social group member. Indeed, we sympathize with those UC members who criticized the process that led to her remarks.
We support attempts by UC members to push for a more democratic and responsible organization. At its most recent meeting, the body considered the question of whether the president and vice president should have the authority to unilaterally, without consideration with other Council members, ask the student body to take an action, like filling out a survey.
Though the proposal failed, we commend those members who sought to ensure that all students were included in these important discussions about social life on campus. It is vital that the UC president and vice president use the powers of their positions to transparently advocate for the interests of the broad student body and avoid any perceived or real conflict of interest.
Indeed, the UC Constitution explicitly advises against such behavior. In Section 22.2, it demands those with conflicts of interest recuse themselves from the decisions in question. Unfortunately, Sachee, the representative of the student body as well as a member of an organization impacted by the proposed ban, seems to fit this bill. Of course, we would encourage all UC leaders to ensure they remain firmly—in both perception and reality—on the right side of those rules.
We understand that her membership in this group poses unique and thorny challenges for her. Indeed, during the 2016 UC election campaign, the UC Election Commission sought to investigate her campaign for allegedly coercing incoming members of the Bee Club to vote for her. There was insufficient evidence to prove that Sachee’s campaign had run afoul of the rules, but to us, the incident highlighted the importance of increased clarity about the relationship between her membership in the Bee and her leadership of the student body.
We would urge her to ensure she is entirely transparent about her involvement in the Bee, especially when her remarks will naturally be construed as those of the UC president. We are not convinced she has done so adequately, and hope she will specify in the future whether she speaks as a member of the Bee or as president of the UC.
To be clear, this should be true for all leaders of the Council, but especially the president and vice president. They must be clear whether they represent the student body or themselves.
More broadly, we urge the UC to engage better with the student body on potential future actions. We call on the UC president and vice president to consult the representatives on decisions so as to better reflect the entire student body, not merely a small fraction of it. Furthermore, we call on UC leaders to engage with other prominent leaders on campus, especially those involved in  student organizations, to understand student opinion. That would be in line with the platform on which Sachee ran which sought to unite the student body.
Ultimately, in the wake of these concerns, we strongly urge the entire student body to vote in future elections. Stories abound of entire Houses failing to vote in UC elections. That is unacceptable. The UC represents the student body, and we, the students, can only hold them accountable if we vote for them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The fall of my junior year was my most difficult period in college. I took a semester off from school to work full-time in Brooklyn on a technology nonprofit I cared about, yet it was a lonely experience full of anxiety.
By October, we only had two months of funding left. What we wanted to build was much harder to build than we first thought, and we had yet to arrive at a business model that would work. I didn’t even know if we’d still be around in summer of 2017.
Despite believing enough in myself to take time off from school to work on a non-profit, I soon lost my self-confidence. So, I did what most juniors do in the fall: I looked for a summer job. I was interested in technology investing, and there were plenty of firms who posted jobs on our school’s career site, making the application process dangerously frictionless. In the end, I accepted an offer within a week of receiving it.
Then something lucky happened. Our nonprofit got funded and I saw a path towards financial stability. But I didn’t have the courage to back out of my offer even though I knew I loved my work in Brooklyn more. I didn’t follow the motto my roommate taught me: “If it’s not a hell yes, it’s a no.” It took an uneasy seven months for me to finally back out of my job in May and work full-time on my nonprofit for the summer. It was the best choice of my college career.
I wish the college climate was one in which choosing non-traditional options was better respected. Sadly, it’s not, and that’s one reason why fewer people pursue them. There’s too much negative peer pressure out there, where we dismiss people who do things that are different as incapable of making it into the established routes.
While I hesitate to give advice because I’ve barely had any life experiences and have no idea how my choices will turn out, here’s what the last two summers taught me about how to avoid the pressure of pursuing certain paths:
All college summers are a risk-free shot at pursuing your passions. These chances are precious and shouldn’t be wasted.
Of course, if financial obligations drive you to take an income-maximizing job, go for it. And if you’re choosing an income-maximizing job to maintain a certain lifestyle, this is a sensible way to make a decision.
My advice is agnostic to specific industries. Ultimately, though, I do encourage people to expand the scope of potential options they think they have beyond the traditional big tech companies, consulting firms, and banks. These are great for people who love them. But based on how many people pursue these three routes, I’m sure that the number of people who go into them because it’s the path of least resistance is much higher than the number of people that go into them because it’s what they love.
Instead, I encourage people to consider less common opportunities. Here is the strategy I like most for finding a non-traditional opportunity. Pick a problem in the world you care about (global warming, wealth inequality, underperforming schools, etc.). Then find the top 10 most interesting, accomplished, or promising organizations who are trying to solve that problem whether they be in the social, private, and public sector. If you can’t find a compelling organization, start solving the problem yourself and look hard for funding on campus.
If you spent sufficient time exploring these options, and you decide they’re not for you: excellent. I wrote this piece because I think traditional opportunities face an unhealthy lack of competition from nontraditional opportunities, and college career centers facilitate this oligopoly. Not because one is better than the other. More choice is good.
Now what if you’re too afraid of taking a nontraditional route because you’re afraid of failing?
For these people, I encourage you to think hard about what failing actually means. I’m confident you’ll realize failing is impossible because you have no responsibility or expectation. Say you pursue a nontraditional job and realize you don’t like the work. This can’t be called a failure for the same reason we don’t call people who go into traditional paths and realize they don’t like them failures.
Or say you start a summer project with the ambition of turning it into a company and it doesn’t work out. Nobody expects you to succeed in starting a company during a summer. This is a move with only upside. If it doesn’t work out, you will have learned more than you could’ve hoped to learn elsewhere and increased your chances of success for your next entrepreneurial goal.
The scenario in which a fear of failure makes some sense to me is when people say, “I don’t want to pursue a nontraditional route because it may close down certain traditional job opportunities in the future.” If you are diligent enough to think this far ahead, the probability is high that you’ll be able to get that traditional job later if you want it. Yes, some opportunities will be closed to you as a result of you not pursuing a certain path. But ask yourself why you even want to keep them open for yourself. Optionality is a dangerous drug. The risk of closing down a door you’ll likely never walk through is the price of discovering something you love.

Even before 2016, American presidential elections have been influenced by the Internet and social media. President Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign revolutionized social media as a way to raise funding—the campaign collected record-breaking amounts primarily from small donations from a wide variety of individuals. President Donald Trump’s campaign also repurposed social media, but, in this case, much of its effectiveness was out of Trump and his team’s hands, and the results were far more disturbing.
By calling most major news sources, whose credibility had never been seriously called into question, “fake,” Trump encouraged right-leaning and independent voters to look elsewhere for their information. Alternative websites such as Breitbart and InfoWars existed before the 2016 election cycle, but their popularity has since skyrocketed, and other sites like them have grown en masse since the explosion of Trump-like rhetoric in the country. Biased news sources exist on the other side of the political spectrum as well, but they are not nearly as radical, and their content is not as violence-inducing as alt-right sites tend to be.
However, the existence of increasingly bipolar and objectively false news is undeniable, and causes a rift in the information people fundamentally share. In a piece for the New Yorker, George Saunders highlights that decades ago, all Americans consumed journalism through the same avenues: by watching one of a handful of nightly news programs, and reading their local newspaper or one of several national magazines like Time. Thus, if information was mistakenly reported or construed with a bias, all people began in the same arena; rules were understood, and people generally agreed on at least a few facts.
Today, almost no shared foundation for political beliefs or actions exists. Dozens of “news outlets,” ranging from cookie-cutter non-cable programming to independent news sites promulgated through Facebook to minuscule articles fed through Snapchat Discover, attempt to fill the fractures. It is nearly impossible for politics to found itself on a basis of information that all people share, when almost nothing is agreed upon as being objectively true or particularly relevant.
A recent research study out of Stanford shows that “heavy media consumers are more likely to believe ideologically aligned articles.” In other words, those who spend more time watching T.V. and scrolling through Facebook are more susceptible to fake headlines and news articles.  Another study by the Washington Post ranks states based on how “couch-potatoey” they are, a metric that was heavily influenced by levels of media consumption. Of the 10 most “couch-potatoey” states, every single one of them voted for Trump. Many are in the Midwest.
While there are many more variables at play for both the couch-potato metric and a state's political leanings, the two studies reveal that citizens of these states are more vulnerable to fake news articles, which write favorably of Trump more often than of Democratic politicians.
Social media, to an even larger extent than news outlets, also radicalized communication regarding political events and ideologies. Writing a letter to the editor of your local newspaper is no longer a pertinent way to share an opinion. As their popularity began to proliferate, sites like Twitter or Facebook ostensibly presented an opportunity for exposure to more diverse perspectives, but have instead become a wormhole for highly specific, distorted information. The people who once felt too ashamed or too isolated to spew their factually incorrect viewpoints can now join a community of those just like them, through Facebook pages and comments and shaky “news” websites.
In rural areas of the Midwest, this is particularly attractive and useful. Those living in 300-person towns surrounded by 200 miles of farmland with one stoplight are no longer limited to the viewpoints of the people in their small community. Through Facebook, they can connect with other people who think just like them. There is no need to question their off-kilter beliefs or justify their reasoning—instead, they can connect with those who share their viewpoints hundreds of miles away. Avoiding difficult questions about our ideals has become far too easy, and citizens share an obligation to escape their self-serving realms of political discourse and seek opinions that make them uncomfortable; without this, separate political parties evolve into cesspools of recycled and invalidated information.
For the last eight years of an Obama presidency, and perhaps stretching back further than that, a large consortium of people clearly felt that their leanings couldn’t be vocalized. Their sometimes quiet thoughts, disconnected from the mainstream ideologies of both Republicans and Democrats, awakened as a result of Trump’s presence in the political realm. His brash personality provided the catalyst for them to seek each other out, force their views into the public realm, and find strength in numbers.

The “closed loop” of conservative media has pushed the Republican Party farther to the right, argued Jackie K. Calmes, the White House editor for the Los Angeles Times Washington bureau, at the Kennedy School Tuesday.
In a discussion led by Shorenstein Center Director Nicco Mele, Calmes contended that conservative media outlets have driven Republican leaders to overpromise on issues—like repealing Obamacare and defunding Planned Parenthood—that they later found to be politically unattainable.
“The things [the Republican Party was] promising were always unachievable, but they were thrown out there as red meat encouraged by conservative media,” Calmes said.
Calmes argued that the Internet, talk radio, and cable television have together created a confined “ecosystem” of right-wing media that has pushed politicians to adopt more extreme policy stances at the expense of effective governance.
“You take something as basic to Republican ideology as tax cuts, and [Republican politicians] cannot do it,” she said.
And asked how she sees the relationship between conservative media and Republican politicians changing in the future, Calmes said the outlook was bleak: “It’s only going to get worse,” she said.
The rise of the Internet as a dominant news source has only intensified this relationship, she said. She added that journalists should not stop reporting on President Donald Trump’s tweets, which “provide a unique window into the mindset of the President of the United States.”
Liam D. deClive-Lowe ’21, who attended the talk, said he found Calmes’ ideas enlightening.
“My biggest takeaway was that right now we have two major parties in America, one which is a governing party that can’t win elections and one that’s a winning party that can’t govern,” he said.
Lloyd P. Deshaye, a retired Canadian provincial court judge, also said he was satisfied with the event.
“It’s gratifying that people are talking so openly about the state of government in the United States,” he said.

Bon Me, a Vietnamese-inspired salad and sandwich shop, and Pavement Coffeehouse could open in the renovated Smith Campus Center as soon as September 2018—as long as Cambridge approves their permitting applications.
The two companies join Swissbäkers, the Boston family-owned bakery, as potential tenants in the new student center, which will feature as many as eight food vendors.
Bon Me and Pavement Coffeehouse have been working with Harvard’s real estate office and are beginning to move through the Cambridge approval process, and a meeting in front of the Board of Zoning Appeal will take place  Oct. 26.
Lawrence Margulies, president of Pavement Coffeehouse, said the University contacted him in the spring to see if he would be interested in a possible Smith Center location. He said Harvard reached out to many different local businesses and invited them to come in and present slides on how their business might add to the Smith Center environment.
“They wanted to keep things local and authentic,” Margulies said. “I think that they’re cognizant of the fact that rents in Harvard Square have exceeded the reach of most independent operators—that’s why you see CVS and Santander Bank and Citizens Bank.”
University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an emailed statement that after conversations with students, faculty, and staff, the University is working to select the eight food venues.
“That dialogue identified desirable attributes in the selection of eateries that are local, diverse, sustainable and experienced, and would include healthy, fresh and organic options at affordable prices,” she wrote. “Together, the various restaurants will help create a casual, comfortable and welcoming environment that remains a primary goal for the Smith Campus Center.”
Bon Me, which currently brings its popular food truck to the Science Center Plaza and has restaurants around Boston and in Cambridge, is planning to operate a counter at the front of the main lobby. While a spokesperson for Bon Me declined to comment, their zoning application describes how they will fit into the campus center.
“As a locally owned and operated business, Bon Me will be in keeping with Harvard Square’s identity as a district anchored by the university and local businesses,” the application reads. The establishment hopes to help “make the building a vibrant gathering place for the Cambridge and Harvard community.”
According to Pavement’s zoning plans submitted to the Board of Zoning Appeal, Pavement Coffeehouse would be in the building’s main welcome area and feature a staircase up to their second floor cafe space.
Margulies said that a Harvard Square location is something he had previously considered in the abstract, though he said high rents prevented him from opening a location there. The company currently operates six stores, all of which Margulies said largely serve university areas.
“I think that we fit—what we sell and how we sell it—fits very well into the demographic of who’s going to be there,” he said. “I’m excited about being part of the Harvard community and having a new angle on things and being surrounded by the professors and tourists and students.”
The University declined to comment on other food venue possibilities, citing confidential lease negotiations. All food venues will have to proceed through the Cambridge approval process as fast order food venues.

Business School professor David A. Thomas has been appointed the twelfth president of Morehouse College, the Morehouse College Board of Trustees announced Monday.
Thomas, whose research focuses on diversity in leadership, said he found the Morehouse position particularly attractive because it presented an opportunity to unify several themes in his own work.
“Higher education, leadership development, trying to understand and create the conditions for positive race relations for the development of leaders regardless of color—those are all themes that have animated my work for 30 years, and here was an institution that I could possibly lead that represents those things,” he said.
Located in Atlanta, Morehouse College is the largest male-only historically black college in the United States. Graduates include Martin Luther King Jr., actor Samuel L. Jackson, and director Spike Lee.
Thomas, a Yale graduate, will be the first non-alumnus Morehouse president in over fifty years. He has previously served as dean of Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, where he oversaw an more than $100 million capital campaign.
Although this presidency will be his first official role at Morehouse, Thomas said he has “always had an attachment and admiration for Morehouse.” He applied to the school in 1974, but was unable to attend for financial reasons.
“Morehouse admitted me, but they didn’t have scholarship money for me, and I got a full scholarship to go to Yale,” he said. “So I went to Yale, but I would have otherwise gone to Morehouse.”
Thomas said this experience has informed one of his major goals for his tenure as president: a capital campaign to expand scholarships.
“We can increase the level of scholarships and defray some of the cost of the Morehouse education…to try and make sure there are no more stories like mine,” he said.
Thomas also plans to hire new faculty, renew the campus infrastructure, and build stronger partnerships with corporations and other organizations.
“Having David at Morehouse will raise the profile of our world-class institution and lead to partnerships that will allow Morehouse to be more competitive for top students…and provide more signature opportunities for leadership that make Morehouse Men among the most sought-after graduates in the country,” Willie Woods, chairman of the Morehouse Board of Trustees, wrote in a press release.
Thomas said he looks forward to the opportunity.
“It’s a real honor to be the person they've entrusted,” he said.

Classroom to Table, a popular College program which pays for students to eat at Square restaurants with professors, has returned for another year with slight modifications.
The program, piloted Sept. 2015, will partner this year with six participating restaurants in Harvard Square: Grafton Street, Legal Seafood, Park Restaurant, the Hourly Oyster House, Temple Bar, and Russell House Tavern.
Unlike last year, the program now limits students to participating in four Classroom to Table meals per semester, a move intended to increase student access amongst limited funds. Last semester, the program ended early after running out of funds due to high demand.
Additionally, the per-person funding has increased to 30 dollars from 20 dollars at the program’s start and 25 dollars last year. Harvard pays restaurants directly to cover meal costs, tax, and an 18 percent gratuity. In line with previous policy, the College will not pay for alcoholic beverages for faculty or students.
The College began accepting reservations on October 16 from groups of four to six current undergraduates and faculty. Students and faculty made just under 1,000 Classroom to Table reservations in the program’s inaugural year, according to administrators.
Jongtae Jeon ’21 wrote in an email that he’s interested in using Classroom to Table “to get to know my professors outside of a strictly academic setting.
“I am going to use it to have dinner with my philosophy professor, Bernhard Nickel, along with some friends from the class,” Jeon wrote. “I'm hoping to delve deeper into some of the philosophical questions we've been discussing in class, but also learn more about him and his interests.”
Ethan S. Medlan ‘21, who is also planning on using the program soon, said he looks forward to the “free food and talking to a professor in a non-formal environment.”
Sophia J. Lee ‘21 echoed those sentiments, adding that she thought the program was a good idea and that she would like to participate eventually.
Reservation requests dated October 23 and on are now accepted on the program’s website.

Students stood vigil Tuesday night at the steps of Harvard’s Memorial Church in solidarity with those affected by President Donald Trump’s latest immigration restrictions.
Around 100 protesters, mostly undergraduates, attended the vigil, which began with a sunset prayer led by Harvard Muslim Chaplain Khalil Abdur-Rashid. Harvard’s Anti-Islamophobia Network organized the event, which featured speeches from the Chaplain and from undergraduate students directly and indirectly affected by the ban.
Anwar B. Omeish ’19, director of external relations of the Harvard Islamic Society, said she helped organize the event because “we wanted to create a sense of solidarity and...keep the conversation about this going.” Omeish expressed concern that each successive “Muslim ban” has received less media attention and concerted resistance than the last.
The AIN, an offshoot of the Harvard Islamic Society, was formed in response to Trump’s initial executive order restricting travel from several Muslim-majority nations in January 2017, and has been organizing protests and coordinating with local government. The network billed Tuesday’s vigil as “Establishing Justice: Prayer & Vigil Against Muslim Ban 3.0.” HIS president Zarin I. Rahman ’18 said she hoped it could provide “a space to mourn, to learn, and to know small things that [attendees] can do moving forward that can help eliminate the larger problem.”
The event formed in response to Trump’s proclamation on Sept. 24 which aimed to  indefinitely ban immigrants and refugees from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, North Korea and Venezuela, the third iteration of a policy that vigil speakers referred to as a “Muslim ban.”
Federal Judge Derrick K. Watson ’88 temporarily blocked the policy for the six Muslim-majority countries on that list Tuesday afternoon. While vigil speakers expressed relief and gratitude for Watson’s decision Tuesday, they said it was not enough.
“Waiting for judges to block executive orders is not a sustainable way to live...we’re going to keep going until there’s no Muslim ban ever, and I’m going to keep going until there are no policies that target Muslim communities, or any other communities, for that matter,” Omeish said.
Abdur-Rashid echoed Omeish’s sentiment.
“[The Muslim prayer] begins with standing, and it ends with sitting, to symbolize the idea that when you enter life, when you devote yourself to a particular direction, you must be very vigilant. You must stand. You must be active, and pro-active, in making sure that violence and injustice does not prevail, that oppression does not prevail, that harm does not prevail,” Harvard Islamic Chaplain Khalil Abdur-Rashid said. “And then we bow ... as if we’re going to rest, but then we rise again, to remind us that you should not only stand once, but you should be standing repeatedly.”

After Lisa Borders lost her bid for the mayorship of Atlanta, she adopted the motto “failure isn’t fatal, it’s feedback”—and rebounded to become the president of the Women’s National Basketball Association.
Borders, who has led the WNBA since 2016, shared this and other anecdotes during a conversation at the Kennedy School Tuesday about her life and career in the nonprofit, public, and private sectors.
Borders said her path to the WNBA was anything but straightforward. Before a crowd of about 50 attendees, she recounted her first taste of adversity in a newly-desegregated school, switching majors at Duke University, and waiting for her son to grow up before running for public office.
“Everywhere I have worked, I have always been underestimated,” Borders said. “That’s a very strong weapon. Don’t think I can do it? Watch this. It gives me inspiration when people say I can’t.”
Borders said that she often did not realize the benefits of her experiences until later, like the time she was able to apply her fluency in French when working for Coca-Cola in Africa—a job she would not have taken had she won the 2009 Atlanta mayoral race. She said hopes that her audience could learn from her losses in the same way she did.
“The takeaway that I would have for Harvard students is that they just have to be true to themselves,” Borders said. “As trite as that sounds, it took me a long, long time to not only understand that, but to believe it. If you bring your whole self, then you’re adding value to the whole.”
The event was part of the Center for Public Leadership’s series of “C-Suite Sessions,” run by Communications and Events Coordinator Samantha Goober.
“We’re hoping to bring in those high-level leaders to teach our students about what it’s like to lead from the top, what it’s like to be an authentic leader, and also most importantly what are the biggest challenges and failures that you’ve faced and how have you overcome them to get to where you are today,” Goober said.
In addition to the event, Borders met with the Harvard women’s and men’s basketball coaches and teams and toured the athletics facilities. The women’s team also attended the conversation Tuesday.
“It’s one thing to share your perspective, and another to hear the questions so you understand where your audience is,” Borders said. “The event was a blessing for me, and I’m hoping that I added some value here.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the U.S. and Turkish governments abruptly announced they would stop issuing most visitor visas between the countries earlier this month, some at Harvard are worried that Turkish scholars and relatives of students may be barred from coming to the country—and vice versa.
The two countries announced on October 8th that they would mutually suspend nonimmigrant visa services, which allow foreign citizens—including some Harvard students—to travel between Turkey and the United States. While students who currently hold valid visas will not be affected, those applying for new visas may face problems.
Mark C. Elliott, Harvard’s vice provost for international affairs, said the University has a large number of Turkish students and alumni holding nonimmigrant visas. Elliott said the visa ban makes it “almost impossible” for new Turkish students to come to Harvard, as well as for current students to study abroad in Turkey.
“It means it will be very difficult for students or faculty who want to travel to Istanbul or anywhere else in Turkey to study or do research. I don’t know how you’re going to get your visa,” he said. “How long this tiff between our two governments will last, I don’t know. I don’t have any privileged information about that, but if it lasts a long time, it’s a real problem.”
Bedel Turker ’18-’19, co-president of the Harvard College Turkish Student Association, said he hopes the tension between Turkey and the United States will soon be resolved. Until then, though, Turker said he is unsure if some of his relatives in Turkey will be able to attend his graduation.
“I wanted two of my aunts to come to my graduation, but if the current situation persists, then I don’t know,” he said. “It’s already hard to get visas in the first place, but now they will not be able to come or even apply to come.”
Dogus Mordeniz ’20, an undergraduate from Turkey, added that the Harvard College Turkish Student Association provides “a really tight community” in times of political strife.
In an emailed statement, University spokesperson Tania DeLuzuriaga advised students affected by the visa ban to reach out to the Harvard International Office for support.
Carol Ann Litster Young, the administrative and academic support coordinator for the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Harvard, said despite the visa service suspensions, the center is still taking applications from students for the winter term study excursion in Cunda, Turkey.
Still, Elliott said, the visa situation—and President Donald Trump’s other efforts to restrict travel and immigration from certain majority-Muslim countries—pose a threat to Harvard’s reputation on the world stage.
“It’s not going to be easy to run the hospitals here or the research at the Medical School without being able to pick the best postdocs throughout anywhere in the world and not have to worry about what country they’re from,” Elliott said.
“American universities are the best in the world,” he said. “It’s not necessarily because Americans are smarter than everybody else; it’s because we invite people to come from everywhere.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 20, 2017 at 12:55 a.m. 
A 21-year-old man is currently awaiting trial in Cambridge District Court after being arrested in the Leverett House courtyard last week.
The Harvard University Police Department apprehended Peter Asmar, a Cambridge resident unaffiliated with Harvard, around 1:30 a.m. last Wednesday after an altercation with a Harvard staff member and the responding officers, according to the HUPD police log.
Upon arriving at Leverett House to respond to a report of a stolen iPhone 6 Plus pinging near the dining hall, HUPD officers were informed that the culprit had previously assaulted, annoyed, and sexually accosted  the reporting parties along Memorial Dr. After searching the House, the officers found Asmar and “instructed [him] to come out from where they were hiding,” HUPD wrote in the police log.
While the officers led him through the courtyard of McKinlock Hall, Asmar ran from the police and struggled with an officer who attempted to stop him.
After his arrest, Asmar was then booked by the Cambridge Police Department at their headquarters, as is standard for HUPD arrests, CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick wrote in an email.
He is being charged for receiving stolen property, assault, annoying and accosting sexually, trespassing, resisting arrest, larceny, and assault and battery on a police officer. According to the Cambridge District Court, he is currently incarcerated and awaiting his court date on Nov. 7, with bail set at $500.
Earlier this semester, CPD arrested Asmar due to a warrant for disorderly conduct from the Boston District Court, wrote Warnick. According to the Boston Municipal Court, he was involved in an incident near Boylston St. where he was “incessantly hitting on” a girl and “asking for her number.”
Earlier this month, an undergraduate was assaulted along the Charles River while she was running from Leverett House towards Western Ave.

This is part II in a six-part series on Harvard's next president. Part I can be read here, part III can be read here, part IV can be read here, part V can be read here, and part VI can be read here.
The spectre of lawsuits. A media firestorm. Faculty uproar.
Since University President Drew G. Faust announced penalties on members of single-gender social groups in May 2016, Harvard has faced no shortage of criticism. Members of all-female groups charged they were collateral damage in a policy aimed at all-male groups; alumni lamented the threat to Harvard social life as they knew it; and faculty and outside media groups attacked the policy as a violation of students’ freedom of association.
Amid this criticism—and support from some alumni, faculty, and students who see the policy as an important step towards making Harvard’s campus more inclusive—Faust has stood by her initial commitment to disempowering final clubs and Greek organizations. In op-eds, interviews, and YouTube videos, Faust has repeatedly and publicly defended the policy.
In short, the effort has become one of the most controversial and complicated legacies of Faust’s 10-year tenure—and, perhaps, that of her successor.
Before she leaves office, Faust will make a decision on whether Harvard should abandon the current policy or adopt a series of alternatives.
But it will fall to Harvard’s 29th president to implement and oversee the University’s historic effort to reshape undergraduate social life.
Some alumni, donors, and experts say they think Harvard’s thorny social group issues will be one of the first and biggest topics the next president must tackle in his or her early months in office. Whether the 15-member search committee will prioritize the social group policy above pressing financial and strategic considerations, however, remains an open question.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith, who has worked with Faust for almost her entire tenure, said he hopes the next president will arrive ready to learn about Harvard social life.
“I hope the person would come in and want to understand what the situation is with the social scene on our campus today and what the students are saying and what works for them and what doesn’t work for them,” he said. “And then help out to be part of a solution to improve it moving into the future.”
Since Faust’s initial announcement of the policy, its future has grown increasingly complicated. After sustained criticism from professors who charged they had been left out of the process, Smith created a committee composed of Faculty, students, and administrators with the power to “revise or replace” the sanctions.
That committee released its final report in September, laying out three paths forward for undergraduate social life: maintain the current policy penalizing members of single-gender fraternities, sororities, and final clubs; ban membership altogether in unrecognized single-gender social groups; or consider a set of “some other possible solutions.”
While Faculty, alumni, and students wait for Faust to decide which option to pursue, two Faculty motions about the sanctions could be up for a vote in November: one explicitly designed to kill the sanctions and one that would effectively ban membership in single-gender social organizations.
Harvard’s next president will face immediate internal pressure from a restive faculty—but the conflicts over social life may not end there, according to Michael A. DeCesare, chair of the American Association of University Professors Committee on College and University Governance. DeCesare said he expects Faust’s successor will wrangle with the social group policy for years to come.
“I think it's a challenge for any president but particularly Harvard's president,” he said, referring to undergraduate social life. “Other institutions and other presidents look to the presidents of institutions like Harvard for guidance for leadership to figure out to handle these thorny social issues and they’re not going away anytime soon; they’re going to proliferate actually.”
The sanctions have divided alumni and Faculty, who disagree about whether Harvard’s next president should change course.  John G. Heller ’79 said he wrote Harvard out of his will because of the penalties.
“I just find it distasteful that Faust tarnished an otherwise remarkably effective legacy wading into these issues,” he said.
Heller said he thinks the Board of Overseers should “table” the policy and let the next president start over.
Donor and former Harvard College Fund Committee Member Philip N. Duff ’79 also criticized the policy, and said there is a nationwide trend of “letting social policy override the whole academic environment.”
“Whoever is the leader at Harvard has the potential of changing that dynamic of the country,” he said.
Other alumni, like prominent donor Michael T. Kerr ’81, say they are “extremely in support” of Faust’s attempt to revolutionize undergraduate life.
Kerr said dealing with the policy itself, including potential lawsuits, will be a part of the next president’s tenure.
“It would be my hope that the policy on the social groups would get settled this year,” he said. “The next President will have to implement it.”
Though the College’s attempts to regulate undergraduate social life seem likely to play an outsize role in the next president’s first months—even years—in office, experts, donors, and alumni say the sanctions are unlikely to affect the presidential search itself.
The search for Harvard’s next president—historically a months-long, secretive process in which Harvard’s most powerful players criss-cross the country to conduct interviews behind closed doors with presidential hopefuls—officially kicked off this summer.
After Faust announced her decision to step down on June 15, members of the Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—began the process to find her successor. Just six days after the announcement, Corporation senior fellow William F. Lee ’72 revealed the makeup of the search committee: all twelve Corporation members and three members of the Board of Overseers, Harvard’s second-highest governing body.
Since then, the committee has met multiple times to discuss priorities and define what makes an ideal candidate. Susan L. Graham ’64, a member of the search committee, said last month that the search remains in “information-gathering mode.”
One piece of information likely not being gathered, according to search experts: how potential candidates might handle Harvard’s sticky social group situation.
“As far as how banning social groups will affect who the finalists are or who is brought to campus or who’s ultimately appointed, it’s difficult for me to see a kind of causal link there,” DeCesare said.
Stephen M. Waters ’68, a major Harvard donor and a member of the FAS Campaign Steering Committee, agreed with DeCesare. He said he would be “surprised” if the search committee prioritizes candidates’ ability to deal with Harvard’s social scene as it selects the next president.
He added he thinks other qualities are much more essential. He listed in particular financial acumen—including the ability to drive capital campaigns and manage the endowment—and the “tone” the new president will set for faculty and students.
“Those are all really important issues and to my mind more important than the question about the social clubs,” Waters said.
Though unlikely to dictate which candidates Harvard considers, the social group policy brouhaha may dictate which candidates consider Harvard, DeCesare said.
He said he thinks the College’s social life issues—combined with other controversies like the ongoing Department of Justice investigation into Harvard’s race-based admissions practices—will place the University’s next president under an unprecedented level of pressure and scrutiny.
“It’s probably more of a higher pressure position than it has been at least in recent history, perhaps ever,” he said. “It’s going to attract people who feel up to the challenge.”

UPDATED: October 18, 2017 at 11:07 a.m.
As the search for Harvard’s next president stretches into its fourth month, some students are launching an online campaign in an unconventional effort to promote Computer Science Professor Margo I. Seltzer ’83 as a possible candidate—and claiming she wants the job.
A Google document circulated over a private messaging board for Women in Computer Science, an undergraduate student group, urged students to send “physical letters” to the University’s presidential search committee supporting Seltzer’s candidacy. Though the document was distributed over the group’s internal lists, Woman in Computer Science co-president Lisa C. Lu ’19 said the group did not organize the effort or author the document.
“Reaching out with some exciting news! Prof. Margo Seltzer, an amazing CS prof… has expressed interest in succeeding Drew Faust as Harvard University President,” one student wrote in the messaging board. “I was wondering if you’d be interested in sending a letter of support for her—the letter needs to be sent in by 9/30!”
Seltzer said she “recently” became aware of the student-led effort, but that she did not ask the students to send letters supporting her candidacy. Asked whether she would like to serve as Harvard’s next president, Seltzer said she did not expect to get the job offer.

“I am incredibly honored that my students think that I would make a good president and of course if I were asked to serve there would be no way I could turn down such an offer,” she said. “I’m certainly not holding my breath expecting that this will be offered to me, but it would be my honor to serve the University in that capacity.”
In past searches, potential presidential candidates have often remained tight-lipped about whether they would like the job. By January of the University’s 2007 presidential search, the field had winnowed to 30 candidates—yet by that point, none of the 30 had openly declared interest in the presidency.
Some had actually given public denials of interest, though the 2007 search committee said it did not take candidates’ public denials into account.
University President Drew G. Faust announced she plans to step down next year in June 2018; since then, Harvard has mobilized to find its next president. Members of the search committee—comprising all twelve members of the Harvard Corporation and three members of the Board of Overseers—met numerous times over the summer to discuss the process and the qualities they’ll look for in potential candidates.
In July 2017, Corporation senior fellow and search committee chair William F. Lee ’72 sent an email to Harvard affiliates asking them to send the committee names of potential candidates.
A student search advisory committee will hold an open meeting on Thursday.
Women in Computer Science co-president Lisa C. Lu ’19 said her organization did not create the Google document, though members sent it over club lists. Lu said that—as far as she knows—the document was written by a few alumni who thought Seltzer might be a good candidate.
Suriya Kandaswamy ’20, a former student of Seltzer’s, said Seltzer would make a good president in part because she always puts her students first. Seltzer agreed to take on 20 advisees "even though she's on sabbatical," Kandaswamy said.
The Google document sent over the Women in Computer Science lists “talking points” for why Seltzer deserves to be Harvard’s next president, neatly divided into categories titled  “Why Margo” and “Why now.” The two-page document suggests students focus on these “important points” in the letters to the committee.
Under “Why Margo,” the document’s authors highlighted Seltzer’s academic prowess, her experience mentoring students, her time working at various tech startups, and her “championing” of women in science. The document particularly notes that Seltzer serves as faculty advisor for Women in Computer Science.
Under “Why now,” the document’s authors argued Harvard’s next president must have a strong background in technology and engineering—a background, the document argues, like Seltzer’s.
“Professor Seltzer’s significant experience in the technology sector will enable Harvard to tap into fundraising opportunities and emerge as a leader in the technology, entrepreneurship, and engineering hubs,” the document reads.

Lavietes Pavilion has officially re-opened.
The Harvard men’s basketball team hosted the athletic complex’s welcome-back party with a new dose of energy on Friday at the seventh annual Crimson Madness.
The sense of freshness went beyond the multi-million dollar renovations done over the summer at Lavietes Pavilion, which included a new state-of-the-art scoreboard, bleachers, and hardwood floor. For a team that suffered a heartbreaking early exit in the inaugural Ivy League Tournament last season, this year marks a renewal in spirit as Harvard coach Tommy Amaker’s program hopes to return to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2015.
The showcase, which featured a three-point shootout, slam dunk contest, and an intrasquad scrimmage, capped off the Crimson’s first official week of practice. Harvard fans also had their first glimpse of the three new members of the team, freshmen Danilo Djuricic, Reed Farley, and Mario Haskett.
Among those in the stands on Friday evening were former standout Zena Edosomwan ’17 and 2017 Boston Celtics first-round pick Jayson Tatum.
The 2017-2018 edition of the Crimson will rely greatly on its bounty of second-year contributors, who earned a large chunk of minutes in Amaker’s rotation last season. Upperclassmen Chris Egi, Corey Johnson, and Weisner Perez will likely see playing time alongside the star-studded crop of sophomores.
In the 16-minute scrimmage, the chemistry among the sophomores was reinforced on the first two points of the game, as guard Christian Juzang threw a lob to 6’11” forward Robert Baker for a powerful dunk. Baker would finish the half with six points, while sophomore forward Chris Lewis led the Crimson team with seven points in a 30-24 victory over the Black squad.
Several guards saw success beyond the three-point line, a point of emphasis in Amaker’s inside-out offensive approach. Juzang, who started at lead guard for the Crimson team and figures to compete with the injured junior Tommy McCarthy for backup point guard minutes, nailed a triple to give his team an early lead. Johnson, the team’s three-point specialist from a season ago, and sophomore point guard Bryce Aiken were also successful from long range.
During a break in the action, Jeremy Lin ’10, Wesley Saunders ’15, and Siyani Chambers ’16-’17 were featured in a video message on the new scoreboard, offering positive encouragements to the team for the upcoming season.
The younger talent of the team will need to take over the on-court and off-court roles of these former cornerpieces of Amaker’s program. Amaker will likely rely on Aiken to replicate Chambers’ and Lin’s court vision and Saunders’ scoring ability, while Lewis and Egi figure to take over Edosomwan’s inside presence in the Crimson frontcourt.
Six members of the squad participated in the three-point shootout, which saw impressive first-round performances by Aiken and classmates Justin Bassey, Henry Welsh, and Seth Towns. Welsh, an important frontcourt anchor for Amaker, showed his confidence beyond the arc as he sank multiple shots from the first two racks of the contest. Welsh did not attempt a single shot from beyond the arc in his first season in Cambridge.
However, the big man was eclipsed by Bassey and Towns in the contest, and in the final round, Bassey earned the victory, scoring 13 out of a potential 18 points.
The slam dunk contest featured both young and experienced talent, as Egi ultimately took over the crown from last year’s winner, Edosomwan. Haskett also impressed, earning a first round score of 50 on his second dunk. After bouncing the ball between his legs off the backboard, the freshman threw down a powerful right hand dunk to the thunderous roar of the crowd. Egi matched this performance, donning a Vince Carter jersey before emulating his signature “elbow-in-the-rim” dunk for a perfect 50.
In the final round, Egi jumped over fellow senior guard Andre Chatfield after receiving a pass from his mother. After several missed attempts, Egi successfully nailed the slam, good enough to bring home a final round 46 and the victory.
Harvard fans will need to wait another month to see the Crimson play its first game, as it takes on MIT at home on Nov. 10. The season opener will mark Amaker’s 11th season as head coach for the program. If Friday is any indication, the season looks to be a promising one for Amaker’s bunch.

Loss, win, win, loss, win.
So reads the Harvard football team’s schedule from the season opener against Rhode Island to last week’s victory over Lafayette. Thus far, Harvard has not proven itself as the top Ivy League contender, nor has it fallen by the wayside as a pretender. Fittingly, it is nearly impossible to gauge the Ivy League as a whole—upsets have abounded, and it seems like with every passing week predictions become harder and harder to make.
The midway point is generally the time of year when we start to see separation in the league standings. However, only Penn and Brown have lost twice, and Penn still has the capability for a second-half resurgence. With the culmination of out-of-conference play, the next few weeks should finally give us some idea of the direction in which the league is headed.
Now that Harvard has played its last non-conference opponent of the season, it can home in on the second half of its schedule. This year, none of the final five teams are pushovers. Harvard will have to contend with undefeated Dartmouth and Columbia, league favorite Princeton, Penn and its juggernaut offense, and an upstart Yale squad.
Though half the season has passed, Harvard and its Ivy brethren have only played two league games apiece. Three non-conference games comprise the early part of the schedule, forming a pseudo-preseason. Since these games do not count in the league standings and have no bearing on championship determination, coaches are free to rest top players or give inexperienced players more time on the field.
As one would expect, the Ivy League lives and breathes tradition. The makeup of the conference has not changed from its official inception in 1954, as the same “Ancient Eight” schools battle for the league championship year after year. The football crown is decided by record within the league, rather than with a winner-take-all game like many athletic conferences across the nation.
Each Ivy team plays seven league games in a season, and to extend the schedule to 10 weeks, each team also schedules three non-conference opponents per year. There are some merits to playing non-league teams—for instance, Harvard has had the opportunity to travel to Washington, D.C., and San Diego, Calif., in the past five years to play Georgetown and the University of San Diego.
The non-conference bouts are also crucial in breaking up the yearly monotony of the Ivy League schedule. Since 2000, Harvard has played each Ivy opponent in the same order: Brown is the first league game of the season, followed by Cornell, Princeton, Dartmouth, Columbia, and Penn. Harvard-Yale closes out the fall.
In the long run, however, I believe games outside the Ivy League do both teams and their fans a disservice. Attendance at non-league games is generally poor. Take Harvard’s matchup with Georgetown at the massive RFK Stadium as an example—despite the large alumni fanbases of both schools in the D.C. area, the official attendance was merely 3,256. This figure even accounts for the fans who streamed out the exits at halftime with Harvard leading, 31-2. It is a tall task to draw a sizeable crowd when the game does not really count and is likely going to be a blowout.
On top of paltry attendance figures, the concept of tune-up games is misguided. Though periodic rest is important for players who are expected to play the majority of the season’s snaps, games against inferior competition do not lead to improvement. I am a firm believer in the conventional sports wisdom that one needs to face off against better players and better teams until there is no better team to play.
This year, the Crimson has victories against Georgetown (by 39 points) and Lafayette (by 28 points). The team uncharacteristically lost its season opener to Rhode Island, but as has been noted many times before, Harvard typically dominates teams outside the Ancient Eight. Last year, a loss to Holy Cross snapped a streak of 16 straight victories in non-league games. Is it possible that these barely competitive games mess with a team’s sense of urgency? See Harvard’s loss to Cornell a week after a blowout win against Georgetown.
The only possible solution to this issue would be changing the Ancient Eight to the Ancient Eleven. The Ivy League has pondered adding teams in the past, most notably in 1982. Army, Navy, and Northwestern were the schools in consideration, but ultimately the powers that be rejected these additions. Decades removed from the official formation of the league and with few considerable changes since then, this option is unrealistic at best.
Most likely, the Ivy League will just keep on keeping on. After all, a change is not really urgent, and a season played solely against other Ancient Eight squads would mean three fewer weeks of football. I think I speak for the thousands of football diehards on Harvard’s campus when I say that no one wants that outcome.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the 700th game played at Harvard Stadium, Crimson running back Charlie Booker had a performance for the ages. Against Lafayette (2-5, 2-0 Patriot), the junior racked up a career-high 159 rushing yards on 23 carries and added a touchdown. He was an integral piece of Harvard’s (3-2, 1-1 Ivy) relentless running game and 38-10 domination of the Leopards.
“Number one, physically he’s strong,” Lafayette coach John Garrett said. “He’s quick. He makes upfield cuts if you watch him. Even when approaching tacklers, he just takes his shoulder and is always moving up the field. He never tries to run around."
Booker catalyzed the Crimson’s first drive, scampering for a 31-yard gain and then adding 14 more to put Harvard deep into Lafayette territory. That push led to a four-yard touchdown rush by junior wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley.
Booker’s score came with 38 seconds left in the first half. The touchdown punctuated a 13-play drive that lasted more than seven minutes. Facing first-and-goal from the one, the Crimson lost two yards on three plays. But a pass interference call gave Harvard a new set of downs, and Booker hit pay dirt with a one-yard plunge. Harvard 21, Lafayette 7.
With his remarkable stat line, Booker became the first Harvard player to rush for over 150 yards since Paul Stanton Jr. ran for 235 yards against Penn in 2014. The Crimson’s 296 rushing yards were the most in a game for the team since it rushed for 304 against Columbia, also in 2014.
In part, Booker’s big day came thanks to a strong showing by the Harvard offensive line. The five starters pushed around the Leopards defense and paved the way for many of Booker’s runs. The line has established itself as an important complement to Booker and fellow running back and freshman Aaron Shampklin.
“So far, it’s been a ton of growth,” said junior offensive lineman Ben Shoults. “Liam [Shanahan has] done a great job, coming in as a young guy with his first real experience playing college football. Dan Leden being a senior has really taken all of us under his wing and shown great leadership.”
On the year, Booker has 496 yards rushing on 70 carries, good for 99.2 yards per game. Perhaps the most impressive statistic is his average of 7.1 yards per carry. That number ranks him second-best among all Ancient Eight rushers with at least 50 carries.
The only player in front of Booker is Penn running back Karekin Brooks, who has totaled 586 yards. However, 268 of those yards came in a record-demolishing win against Lehigh. The Marietta, Ga., native has yet to top 90 yards since.
Booker has a nose for the end zone, too. He has found the end zone five times in the same amount of games played. No other Crimson player has more than two rushing touchdowns.
Harvard coach Tim Murphy clearly remembers watching Booker represent Cypress Ranch in the 2014 Texas 6A high school football championship. The running back’s on-field grit propelled him to captain his team as a senior and earn first team All-district honors—and team MVP—twice. Needless to say, Murphy was extremely excited when Booker joined the program and was impressed by his humbleness and strong character.
“Those guys who can gain yards after contact are so hard to find,” Murphy said. “We have a lot of good backs, there are a lot of good backs in our league, but the ones that just punish with their running style are hard to find. He’s a bit like Clifton Dawson in that way—probably not as fast but probably even better after contact. He’s a strong physical kid. He’s explosive. But it definitely takes a certain mentality that enjoys the physical aspect of the game."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Stacked with young talent, Harvard women’s ice hockey looks to improve upon last year’s performance with a strong start to the season against Ivy League foe Dartmouth.
After finishing the 2016-2017 campaign in the middle of the pack, the Crimson will look to rebound this season, with the ultimate goal being the Ivy League championship. Over 70 percent of its scoring returns from last season, but the team’s incoming rookies finding finding their footing in Division I hockey will also be key to the contest against the Big Green.
“We have a huge freshman class that came in,” senior forward Haley Mullins said. “We know that our team is going to be a lot better this year.”
This season, freshman make up almost a third of the young Harvard roster. Due to the many new additions to the team, offseason preparation has focused on team chemistry.
“We have been really focused on gelling with each other and being on the same page as a team,” sophomore netminder Beth Larcom said.
The big question in the Crimson’s opening game will be whether this emphasis on team-building has paid off. Harvard hopes this injection of youth into the room will provide a new spark to an offense that averaged just 1.79 goals per game last year.
“Last year we were complacent,” Mullins said. “We had lots of ties and losses because we didn’t finish out plays.”
The offense is not the only focus in the season opener. The Crimson’s defense will look to start the year strong against an uncertain Dartmouth offense. The Big Green were last in scoring in both the Ivy League and the ECAC last season. Facing such an offensively challenged opponent, Harvard would ideally get pucks out of the defensive zone quickly and spend the majority of its time applying offensive pressure of its own.
Following an underperforming season, Harvard can establish itself at the top of the conference with a strong start. Last season, a rocky beginning defined the rest of the year, as the Crimson lost nine of its first 10 games en route to a 5-19-5 campaign.
“It’s a rebuilding year coming off of last year,” junior defenseman Kaitlin Tse said. “But we have a really strong and incoming class filling big roles that we lost.”
A key to a strong rejuvenation for Harvard will be the leadership of the upperclassmen, especially when it comes to guiding the large class of rookies. The Crimson is led by tri-captains Lexie Liang, Haley Mullins and Kate Hallett, who is only in her third year of play.
Liang, drafted with the twelfth overall pick by the Boston Pride in the 2017 NWHL Draft earlier this year, was Harvard’s points leader last season and will hope to replicate her performance in her final season with Harvard.
At goalie, the Crimson returns only one of three goalies to see the ice last year. Larcom, who minded the net in eight games as a freshman, understands the importance of gaining valuable experience early in one’s first season.
“A big thing for younger players going forward is staying loose and remembering to have fun with it,” Larcom said.
Early chemistry and development will be a pivotal focus for the young squad.
“We have definitely been focusing on team chemistry in the offseason. We need to translate that team chemistry off the ice into making plays on the ice,” said Mullins.
And with this chemistry on lock, Harvard hopes to notch a win in its first regular season game against the Big Green and continue this positive trend moving forward.
“It’s the first time the freshmen get to put on that Harvard jersey,” Larcom reminisced. “I remember when it happened for me last year. That’s always a great experience, and it's our first time in a real game situation this year, so we’re all really pumped up for that."
Harvard topped the Big Green in both matchups last year, winning 5-1 and 2-1, and looks to continue its success against its Hanover-based rival on Friday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Saturday against Brown, junior midfielder Leah Mohammadi posted five shots, and the Crimson's two goalies made some stellar saves. Neither performance was enough for the ailing Harvard women’s soccer team to overcome the Bears.
Under an overcast sky at Ohiri Field, Brown (9-4, 2-2 Ivy League) defeated the Crimson (7-7, 1-3), by the slimmest of margins, 1-0, for its first matchup victory since 2010. The loss stranded Harvard with a 1-4 record over the past five weekends. 
Bears junior forward/midfielder Jennifer Caruso netted the game-winner in the 54th minute off a long midfield cross from senior defender Maclaine Lehan. The tally lasted until the final whistle to mark the Crimson’s second straight 1-0 defeat.
Both sides took a beating during the match—the two teams combined for 27 fouls, with three yellow cards shown during the match, one to a Harvard player and two to the Bears side.
“In the second half, they were more physical in nature of play,” Crimson coach Chris Hamblin said. “They were able to wrestle the game in that direction, which isn’t necessarily our strength.”
Fighting back against a wave of injuries and illnesses, Harvard wasn’t able to shift into the proper offensive gear against Brown.
“It took us awhile to get the ball down in play, and unfortunately in that time, they had opened the scoring,” Hamblin said. “We tried to get back in, move the ball, and create some chances. We just didn’t have enough gas in our tank.”
Freshman forward Murphy Agnew, who garnered Ivy League Rookie of the Week honors in September, chipped in two shots on goal. Sophomore midfielder Meg Tveit hit the crossbar in the 41st minute, but the team’s woes when playing from behind continued.
Now 0-7 in games in which its opponent scores first, the Crimson has struggled to create offense when most needed. On the flip side, Harvard sports a 7-0 record in games in which it scores the first goal.
The rest of the stats favored the visitors on Saturday, if slightly. The Crimson was outshot, 15 to 12, and took two fewer corner kicks—five to Brown’s seven. The two teams were dynamically balanced, but the Bears came out on top on the strength of Caruso’s strike.
Junior Danielle Etzel and sophomore Kat Hess split time in goal, as they’ve done all season. Each made three saves apiece for Harvard. The two have an identical 33 stops each on the year.
Bears junior goalie Christine Etzel, meanwhile, recorded her third shutout of the season, moving into sole possession of third place on Brown’s all-time career shutouts list after making four saves in 90 minutes of work on Saturday. Christine and Crimson junior goalie Danielle Etzel are twins and have been featured on the Ivy League Network together.
Harvard has been fortunate to keep Etzel and Hess in goal in a season when injuries have sidelined key Crimson players for long stretches of time.
“That’s college athletics, and that’s sporting,” Hamblin said. “We recognize that. Our players were prepared to step into the roles and work hard.”
Sitting at 1-3 in conference play, and having lost four of its last five , Harvard has seen the prospect of a Ivy League repeat slip from its grasp. Playing soccer, however, is more than just playing for the standings.
“There’s going to be…years when Harvard doesn’t win a championship,” Hamblin said. “In those years, it’s really important that we grow every game. The attitude has been great. The response has been great.”
For the freshman, facing teams as skilled as Princeton grants invaluable experience. As of Oct. 8, the Tigers ranked sixth in the nation.
“We’ve unfortunately been very unlucky this season with injuries,” co-captain Caroline Chagares said. “However, many players have had to step up into new roles, so there has been a lot growth throughout the season.”
For the outgoing seniors, the season provides a chance to reflect on their important contributions to winning two Ivy titles in their first three seasons.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After 144 years of play, the Harvard football program boasts nine national championships, 14 Ivy League titles, and 20 inductees to the College Football Hall of Fame. It’s hard to be the first to do anything. Last Sunday, however, Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick proved that he’s still in the business of breaking Crimson records.
With a touchdown to tight end Cameron Brate ’14 in the fourth quarter against the Arizona Cardinals, Fitzpatrick completed the first Harvard-to-Harvard scoring pass in NFL history. While the Cardinals earned a 38-33 victory, the score testified to the growing relevance of Crimson players at the professional level.
Last Sunday, Fitzpatrick made it onto the field after an injury to starter Jameis Winston. Midway through the third quarter, the Cardinals held a 31-0 lead. Few could blame Tampa Bay fans for leaving the University of Phoenix Stadium. But Fitzpatrick, Brate, and company still had life.
A third-quarter score reduced the deficit to 31-6. Then, with 13:32 left, the unique event occurred. On third-and-goal from the 10, Fitzpatrick dropped back, scanned the field, and fired a rocket through a pack of defenders.
Another Crimson alumnus was waiting in the end zone. Brate had weaved his way through the Arizona secondary and turned to locate the ball. Hedging a defender with his shoulder, he reeled in the catch and tiptoed inbounds.
The touchdown sparked a larger rally, as the Buccaneers got within 38-33 with 2:02 left. However, the Cardinals recovered the ensuing onsides kick to clinch the contest.
Although nearly a decade apart, Fitzpatrick and Brate had strikingly similar Harvard experiences. The two Dunster House residents guided the Crimson to multiple Ancient Eight championships. As seniors, both players led their squads to 10-0 campaigns.
Fitzpatrick, a Mathematics concentrator, displayed his Harvard roots at the NFL combine, where he scored a whopping 48 out of 50 on the Wonderlic Test. That performance, which assessed cognitive ability, earned Fitzpatrick some pre-draft media attention.
Selected as the sixth-to-last pick in the 2005 NFL Draft, Fitzpatrick has stuck around for more than a decade. Now in his 13th year and on his seventh team, the quarterback has passed for over 26,000 yards and 169 touchdowns.
Meanwhile, Brate graduated from Harvard in 2014 with an Economics degree. Undrafted, he earned a roster spot through preseason tryouts. Last year, “The Brate Train” picked up speed by scoring eight touchdowns.
Having notched four scores already in 2017, Brate looks to further his success—perhaps with the help of a familiar quarterback.

Find yourself facing down against late nights writing papers and studying for exams? Looking for a new place to chill? Or, maybe you just feel guilty about sleeping in until 2 p.m. every day and need a little boost. Lucky for you, you’re in a college town where cafes are ubiquitous and a good cup is easy to find. Cantabrigians appreciate a fine bean, and they’ve provided plenty of options for your every coffee need.
Café Pamplona
The rest are all phonies
With a crowd of regulars who can be seen smoking near the café’s sunny outdoor seating and a minimalist basement interior conducive to off-the-cuff Heidegger references, there’s a reason Crimson reporters went to Pamplona when they wanted to interview Cantabrigians about the demise of the hipster. But, as Harvard Square’s oldest café, the place has its charm—and its own Wikipedia page. An extensive tea menu, interesting crowd, and late hours make this café a great place for late-night conversation or a heartfelt journal entry.
Bring: Real live pen and paper for documenting your every artsy thought
Try: Café Pamplona (the cafe’s signature coffee drink), guava and cheese sandwich, classic hot chocolate
Crema Cafe
To unplug and chow down
Maybe it’s the easy-listening music that plays in the background, or maybe it’s the divine array of pastries lying on the counter. Whatever it is, Crema is the place to go to unplug and to boost your mood before class. The constant lines make it easy to tell that this cafe corners the market at all times of the day with its charming interior and high-quality menu. New cafes are great and all, but Crema has become a Harvard classic. If you don’t mind waiting a little for your avocado and caramelized onion grilled cheese sandwich and taking it to go (somehow, the seats are always taken), you’ll have to try out this spot. If you’re really hungry, the side of sweet potato chips is going to be your best friend.
Bring: Your whole paycheck
Try: Golden Crema or Red Crema coffee beverages, Crema Grilled Chicken sandwich, any of their cupcakes
Darwin’s Ltd.
Home away from home
You might have already passed this local coffee shop on Mt. Auburn St., but if you walk a few minutes from the Yard onto Cambridge St., or past Central towards MIT, you’ll also find two other locations. No matter which branch of the cafe you choose to visit, you’re sure to find a home-y atmosphere, a good soundtrack, and great food and beverages.
Bring: A day’s worth of work—Darwin’s is a great place to camp out and finish that English paper
Try: Chai latte, “The Story”—this is the name at the Mt. Auburn storefront, but sandwich names vary at each location
Tatte Bakery and Cafe
For good food and better aesthetics
If you’re looking for a filling—albeit overpriced—meal, some fancy coffee, or an artsy photo for your Instagram, Tatte (rhymes with latte) is the place to be. Owner Tzurit Or channeled her childhood in Israel to create the menu for the bakery, which originated in Brookline. The aesthetic of the store is unparalleled in the Square, and upstairs you’ll find additional seating as well as a coffee bar. If you don’t stop by on purpose, you’ll probably find yourself wandering in sooner or later because of the alluring smell of fresh pastries that attracts anyone who walks by outside.
Bring: $$$
Try: Spinach and labneh pita, traditional shakshuka dish, nitro-cold brew coffee, nutella cookie
Flour
For a drool-worthy addition to your cup o’ joe
Especially for those of us who really just want some fresh-baked goods with our coffee, Flour is a great place to settle down with a friend. With countless sweet and savory breads, bars, and cookies, as well as a large selection of sandwiches and salads, Flour is sure to satisfy your appetite. Who could resist a sticky bun with dark caramel and toasted pecans, or a brioche filled with pastry cream and chocolate? Or perhaps you just want a simple latte with a lemon scone, or a quiche with a salad. How about a grilled chicken sandwich with brie and onions, or a Korean BBQ beef dinner? Whatever it is that you order, you won’t be disappointed. Just make sure to get a refreshing cup of cold brew on the side.
Bring: A bag for carrying the many, many goods you will inevitably buy
Try: Roast beef sandwich, sticky buns, homemade oreos
Tealuxe / DAVIDsTEA
If you don’t actually want coffee
If you’re more of the tea type, Tealuxe and DAVIDsTEA are going to be your best bets. Pots of loose-leaf tea rest in a wall of drawers behind the counter in Tealuxe, and dark interiors lend this spot a musty, if-I-weren’t-a-chain-I’d-be-a-hole-in-the-wall vibe. With countless varieties of traditional or fruity hot and iced beverages, and even bubble teas (yes, you can get boba from places other than Boston Tea Stop), this spot is great for a break from the bustling Square.
If you want more of an energetic and bright atmosphere, stop by at DAVIDsTEA, where bright blue canisters of tea line the wall. Plus, you can get any type of tea iced, which is great for the blistering temperatures that summer brings.
Bring: Intellect (fake or not), an open mind
Try: At Tealuxe, the mint chocolate chip bubble tea, frozen matcha. At DAVIDsTEA, cinnamon rooibos chai, strawberry rhubarb parfait.
Dunkin’ Donuts / Starbucks Coffee / Peet’s Coffee & Tea
The classics
Though large-scale businesses such as these may not boast the same amount of character as the other cafes on this list, even the most snobbish of sippers will appreciate the coffee chains in the Square.
Sit at the second-story window of the main Starbucks for the best people-watching experience in town, or face inward to observe law students, tourists, and locals alike enjoying their venti Frappuccinos at the coffee bar. If that’s not your thing, head down to the basement of the T station for some of the best Dunkin’ in the state, or to Peet’s to get your commercial chain coffee fix without feeling “basic.” We know you go to Starbucks and Dunkin’ (almost) every day, so a change might be worth it.
Bring: A Boston accent
Try: At Starbucks, a coconut milk mocha macchiato. At Dunkin’ Donuts, an iced latte. At Peet’s, any of their bagels.

We’ve hit that part of the semester where clubs have finished hosting info sessions, and all the freebies that were up for grabs are dissipating. The bustle of the beginning of the school year has settled down, but that doesn’t mean the free stuff is gone. Here are some tips and tricks that’ll help you thrift your way to free essentials.
Always Have Tupperware
Ah tupperware, the best household item since sliced bread. Try something at the dining halls that just hits the spot? Don’t wait for it to rotate back. Instead take out a plastic container and stuff it to the brim with those curly fries.
Bonus tip: Use the to-go cups as a substitute if you don’t have your own tupperware.
Crimzone Rewards
Even Harvard’s less sports-conscious student body can take advantage of Crimzone’s weekly bribes, which often include pizza and t-shirts. Show up, get your points (which can add up to earn flat screens and more), then leave.
Optional: Watching the game.
Lamont Cafe After-Hours
Most baristas will pass out the remaining pastries at the end of the day. Sit it out till closing, and keep your eye on the prize. Sweet chocolate croissants (not a finished p-set).
Follow a Friend
Most organizations will have snacks during their meetings so that’s definitely an option. If the ones you’re a part of don’t satiate your appetite, feel free to follow a friend to their meetings. Once you’re there, politely introduce yourself and say you’re interested in joining next term/year before dipping with food in hand. Your friend can take it from there (if they don’t, it’s time to rethink that friendship).
Craigslist
If you pick up a free futon from Craigslist, please send a small gratuity to Flyby. If you get jumped instead, this point was never part of the article. Always bring back-ups to Craigslist pick-ups and have HUPD/Cambridge Police on speed dial.
