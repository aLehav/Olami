After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The debate over federal funding has featured two parties seemingly incapable of compromise. From Paul Ryan’s slash-and-burn approach to the budget to Harry Reid’s desire to preserve entitlements at all costs, the focus has been on the fighters in the political arena, not the casualties in the war. One of those casualties has been the American justice system, whose lack of funding may deprive Americans of their constitutional liberties. As The New York Times detailed in its investigative piece, “The Bronx courts are failing.” And they are not the only ones. The perilous state of the justice system threatens not only the unalienable rights of American citizens, but also the entire way in which we uphold the law in the United States.
The passing of the sequester deadline without any resolution meant an eight-percent cut to the nation’s judicial budget, which goes toward the expansion of federal justice offices and the restoration of old ones. With courts currently understaffed—the article on the Bronx reported that 73 percent of cases took longer than expected—delays impede the ability of American deliberative justice to do its job. This lack of funding could cause the state to dismiss some of its criminal cases. It could also disproportionately hurt the poor, who often cannot pay the high fees legal firms demand and have to settle for what the state can offer for free. These lawyers, who have been forced to handle cases on month-long delays to account for growing workloads, are spread too thin. By virtue of Gideon v. Wainwright, even criminal defendants are required to get representation; by virtue of the budget cuts, no defendant is likely to get quality representation.
What’s more, this issue is not confined to the federal government. In California, about 65 percent of state support for the courts has disappeared as new political leadership fights growing budget deficits. The result: trials postponed indefinitely and 53 courthouses closed across the state. In the last four years, 42 states have reduced their judicial budgets—laying off employees, freezing hiring, and reducing the operating budget for preexisting towns and counties. The paralysis of the justice system contributes to dual problems of jail-overcrowding and diminishing prosecution, leaving the state on the hook for additional costs.
As an additional problem, these additional costs are increasingly incentivizing states to look to the private sector for prison maintenance, causing the rise of a prison-industrial complex. This phenomenon makes the prosecution of Americans a business with perverse incentives that further distort the ability of judges to enforce justice. The American justice system already has enough inmates—six million and counting—and it has only gotten worse in the last 40 years, as the number of imprisoned citizens in state and federal prisons has increased by over 700 percent. This industry, whose two major groups—the Corrections Corporation of America and the GEO group—receive nearly three billion dollars a year from the government, spends millions every year lobbying American legislators and has exacerbated previous problems with our judicial system.
The liberty of citizens is threatened when their friends’ murderers are left unpunished, when their siblings’ rapists walk free. The right to a free and speedy trial, enshrined in the Constitution’s Sixth Amendment, is a building block on which American democracy rests. The opportunity for every citizen to have effective assistance of counsel in a criminal case preserves a modicum of equality in court between people of disparate economic backgrounds. Removing it cedes control of our adversarial justice system to the wealthiest in our society and only compounds previous issues of wealth inequality in this country. As criminal cases are dismissed, public safety and faith in our justice system are simultaneously compromised. Only the rule of law separates our current society from the Hobbesian state of nature in which each man is forced to fend for his own security.
The federal funding cut of the courts makes up only two-tenths of one percent of the American federal budget. For deficit hawks, the difference is minimal. For the average American citizen, the difference is significantly larger. The appeal process in the federal court system provides enough delay in the resolution of the case; the plaintiff in last month’s Supreme Court affirmative action case has already graduated from college. Further delays at the local level deprive grieving families of justice and cancellations threaten the sense of safety within that community. Depriving the poorest individuals in our nation from the same constitutionally guaranteed representation as the rich makes the court even more of an imbalanced playing field. Our courts are failing. It’s time for Congress to help them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On April 6, with the guidance of fake news icon Stephen Colbert, former President Bill Clinton sent out his first scintillating tweet under the handle @PrezBillyJeff: “Just spent an amazing time with Colbert! Is he sane? He is cool! #cgiu.” Since then, Clinton has transitioned to the more professional handle @billclinton and has shown no signs of abandoning the social media website that has swept the nation.
Whether Clinton is yet a Twitter master remains unclear (or may depend upon what the meaning of what the word “is” is)—the former president has amassed just over 550,000 followers, while more than 38 million subscribe to 140-character updates from Justin Bieber. But, although Bieber’s tweets may spread joy to tweens around the world, Clinton’s decision to take his brand to the Twittersphere has the potential to do something bigger. We see Clinton’s move to Twitter as a step toward bringing down walls between ordinary people and decision-makers.
Twitter, for better or for worse, is a disarmingly intimate platform. Every minute on the website, users of all ages share both their banal daily activities and their deepest thoughts and fears, complete with ampersats and hashtags, with friends and strangers alike. Politicians, however, usually err on the side of impersonality in their Twitter conduct. For example, Barack Obama’s Twitter profile (which, incidentally, also has fewer followers than Bieber’s) rarely features tweets directly from the president. On the other side of the aisle, Speaker of the House John Boehner’s contributions to the Twitterverse mostly include links that explain legislative battles.
Obama’s and Boehner’s tweets have merits of their own, but it is refreshing to see a widely admired elder statesman like Clinton communicate with his followers in a more lighthearted, down-to-earth manner. Clinton’s experimentation with hashtags along with his references to Ellen DeGeneres and Usher display a willingness to connect with the online masses. We hope that average citizens having the chance to interact with political figures as influential as Clinton will start trending as quickly as an expertly crafted Twitter topic and that the isolation some constituents feel from the political process will lessen with the change.
In addition, Clinton’s philanthropic work might gain notice and funding from his newly gained Twitter followers. While some former presidents have dedicated their post-Oval Office lives to such noble pursuits as the art of self-portrait painting, others like Clinton and President Jimmy Carter have elected to improve global health and fight for human rights. Twitter can aid those causes by spreading the positive messages crusaders like Clinton and Carter promote.
Although celebrity tweeters are unfortunately wont to fumble, broadcasting mistakes to millions, we have faith in Clinton not to commit too many Twitter faux pas. Yes, Bubba may have been caught with his pants down before, but we believe he has learned from his mistakes. Using his Twitter feed, Clinton has the opportunity to personalize the political and philanthropic to civilians through the power of social media.
As the Big Dog himself tweeted last week, “#thisisgreat.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I had imagined much about my sophomore year at Harvard: what it would be like to live in a House, which classes I wanted to take, how my friend groups might change.  I did not know that, by the time sophomore fall arrived, those questions would be taking up very little of my time. What I could not have imagined then is that, instead, I would spend the year dealing with the aftermath of being raped.
Miles away from home and Harvard in an unfamiliar city last summer, I was paralyzed and terrified when a stranger forced himself on me.  As someone to whom physical intimacy is part of a deeper emotional commitment, I found myself numb and in shock.  I didn’t know where to turn or who to tell; neither could I fully comprehend the effect this would have on my life in the coming months.  I told myself I had not understood what had happened, that this could never happen to me. And if something had happened, it wasn’t anything to bother other people with.
When night came that day, I could neither control my body’s shaking nor breathe through the overwhelming intensity of my sobs. I called my best friend, a Response peer counselor, and tried to find the words to tell her what had happened.  I barely remember our conversation, but she breathed with me as I cried myself hoarse on the phone.  The only other person I told was my boyfriend. I couldn’t bear to tell my secret to family members because I feared that further acknowledgment of the experience would somehow make it more “real.”  I stumbled through the rest of summer in a state of semi-shock and hoped that, given enough time, the pain that fought to make itself known at the slightest provocation would fade.
Upon returning to campus in the fall, I had high hopes.  The change of environment and the distraction of challenging new classes boded well for turning the page on my summer.  It soon became clear, though, that the stresses of my fast-paced life on campus were exacerbating, rather than distracting me from, the memories and aftereffects of that traumatic experience. Problem sets that once would have been a breeze were difficult to complete without an emotional breakdown, and the language class that used to be the highlight of my day became a test of how long I could keep myself from crying.  I was frustrated that what seemed like an overreaction to the experience over the summer was affecting my ability to function normally.
Because I resented the idea that dealing with the aftereffects and trauma of rape might prevent me from taking advantage of opportunities on campus, I ended up over-extending myself.  I found it unfair that one man’s cruel decision could negatively influence and limit my Harvard experience to such a large degree.  In an effort to prove I could still be the person I wanted to be, I took on a leadership role in one campus organization at the beginning of the semester and ran for a leadership position in another in the middle of the semester.  While this process showed me that my former happy and ambitious self was still inside of me, the stress proved too much.  Food started to make me nauseous, and I lost 10 pounds in the span of two weeks.  I became more lethargic and, after returning from Thanksgiving break, I stopped going to class for a week.  I instead spent hours watching TV and rereading the Harry Potter series, trying to escape into the lives of their fictional characters—and evade the grief and frustration that still hadn’t subsided in mine.
During this time, I was more grateful than ever for the support of my boyfriend, who would hold me while I cried at the futility of it all and made me laugh when I thought I couldn’t, and of the true friends I had found over the preceding year and a half. The pain I was dealing with showed me not only who among those already in my life was willing to stick it out for me, but also who among those I didn’t know as well was worth having in my life. In particular, a number of women from my sorority showed me unconditional love and talked me through more than one 2 a.m. tearful phone call, some just because they had heard I was having a bad day.  I also forged a strong relationship with a friend who was having an equally difficult semester and to whom I could give as much as I took.  The depth of support I received from her and other important people in my life made those months bearable.
My resident dean was equally supportive.  Beyond understanding my situation and encouraging me to give myself more credit, she helped me think clearly and logically about my options in terms of making it through the semester.  Fueled by her support and recommendations, I worked with my professors to make up the work I had missed and finished the semester with four half-courses on my transcript.
The support of Harvard’s mental health services was also fundamental in getting me through the semester.
Prior to returning to Harvard in the fall, I had had a conversation with my best friend from home in which I opened up to her and she, in return, made me promise to give mental health counseling at school a try. “You know I’m the last person to think counseling would be helpful,” she told me as I eyed her skeptically, “but it really helped me last semester after my mom made me promise to try it.”  Unconvinced, I told her I would, but I couldn’t see myself following through when I got to campus.
A week or two into the semester, the struggle to finish simple assignments and get excited about my classes became overwhelming. Frustrated, confused, and emotionally exhausted, I was ready to give anything that had a chance of helping me a try.
My friend who is a Response peer counselor introduced me to Sarah Rankin at the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, who was kind and patient as I struggled to make it through the details of my story.  She told me that what I was experiencing was not abnormal and that it also wasn’t as uncommon here at Harvard as I thought.  She gave me tips for dealing with flashbacks when they unexpectedly arose—as they so often did—and she recommended someone I could see more regularly at Mental Health Services.
I had mixed feelings.  Everything I had heard about MHS was negative: “They never have time to meet with you,” “they’re way understaffed,” “they’re not even that good.” But talking with Sarah had made me feel genuinely better, and that indicated to me I had something to gain from talking with someone on a regular basis.
My best friend from home was right.  Talking to someone did help—a lot.  A week after I scheduled the 20-minute introduction call required of all new MHS patients, I was in an office with my newly assigned counselor, sharing for only the fifth time what had happened to me.  My counselor listened as much as I needed and at the end asked me one or two questions, designed to make me reconsider the way I was thinking about what had happened to me.  Throughout the course of our weekly appointments, I slowly built up an understanding of the full extent of the effects the experience had on my life. I started to build a framework within which I could deal with them.  My counselor coached me through what I wanted to say to my parents when they each were in town. She helped me come to terms with the reality of what had happened to me.  And, even though my counselor never made any mention of a legal process, our discussions helped me build the confidence I needed when I eventually decided to go to the Harvard University Police Department and explore the possibility of pressing charges.
At HUPD, too, all I was met with was understanding and a willingness to help.  While the case is not under their jurisdiction, since the incident was not on Harvard property and the suspect is not associated with Harvard, the HUPD officer I met with has been serving as a liaison between me and the officer investigating the case.  The process is ongoing. As a result of the accommodations HUPD has made, though, I have been able to press charges without any physical disruption to my day-to-day life. And while my experience with MHS could not prevent the pain I experienced last semester, it gave me a framework within which I could begin to understand it and start to pick up the pieces of my life.
The process of recovery has been long, and I imagine I still have a ways to go. Mental Health Services and Harvard’s support system gave me perspective and much-needed help during a difficult time in my life. My story is just one sliver of the broader experience with mental health support at Harvard, and as such I don’t expect to be able to find a panacea for this campus’ problems from within it.  However, I do hope that more of those of us on campus who are struggling will seek help in one form or another.  For its part, I hope that the University can expand on what it is doing well, as in my case, to match the overwhelming need.  There are many here who stand to benefit from receiving the same compassionate care I did.
Editors’ Note: The author of this piece requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the legal case discussed in the article. It is our hope that this piece will bring to light issues that affect members of our community and inform campus-wide conversations on sexual violence and health services at Harvard.

Researchers at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences have developed a mechanism for tactile sensation that will allow robotic machinery to be more gentle, durable, and affordable than before.
Known as TakkTile, the new technology allows for more reliable and precise touch sensors, and researchers say that potential use of the new mechanism can be fully realized by future innovation.
“There were already [many ways] to develop tactile sensors,” said Yaroslav Tenzer, a post-doctoral fellow at SEAS and co-creator of TakkTile. “Unfortunately, all of them have disadvantages. They are fragile, they are not robust, and they are far too expensive.”
Because of this, Tenzer and fellow designer Leif P. Jentoft, a Ph.D student at SEAS, built a new sensor called TakkTile that is sensitive to the level of one gram, able to withstand up to 25 pounds of pressure or a hit from a baseball bat, and extremely cheap to assemble.
The combination of durability and cost is what makes TakkTile unique. Previously, technology that could provide such a high level of sensitivity could typically only be found in a research laboratory. Most systems would be too weak for everyday use and too expensive for practical applications.
“There’s nothing else that is cheap and easy to manufacture that can be this sensitive,” Jentoft said. Tenzer added that TakkTile technology is “ten times cheaper” than anything else on the market.
Encased in a protective layer of rubber, TakkTile uses a miniature barometer to detect slight changes in pressure and react to very slight touches. These barometers are commonly found in GPS locators and cellphones, and are thus available cheaply.
Depending on the project, developers could potentially use hundreds of              TakkTiles at a very low cost. “If you want to cover a small area, you would only need one of them,” Jentoft said. “But if you have a different application, then you could use hundreds of them to tailor the use directly to your need.”
According to Jentoft and Tenzer, the applications of TakkTile are far-reaching. While researchers developed them to provide a sort of nervous system for robotic hands in an effort to make their robots more dexterous and gentle, the co-creators stressed that the true value of the project lies in the applications that other designers will find for it.
“Any researcher who needs a sensitive robotic object can basically build it now,” Tenzer said. “The basic functionality is so awesome and could have so many uses.”

Motivation in rats is influenced not only by their most recent experiences, but also by a series of recent experiences, according to a recent study by a team of Harvard biology researchers.
The study, published last April in the journal Nature Neuroscience, tested how quickly rats decided to start pursuing a predetermined reward. Researchers found that the amount of time between receiving a reward and restarting the reward-seeking process depended on the size of previously-received rewards.
“People focus too much on choices,” said molecular and cellular biology professor Naoshige Uchida, adding that his study examines instead the eagerness of a rat to make those decisions, rather than the decisions themselves.
To receive a reward, a rat first had to push a button with its nose, releasing a sweet or sour odor. A sweet odor indicated that a variable amount of water would be dispensed from a hole to one side of the rat, while a sour odor meant the water would be distributed from the other side. After the rat collected the water, the researchers measured the amount of time before the rat returned to deliver another nose poke to restart the process.
As was expected, rats who had received larger awards were more eager to restart the experiment. But interestingly, the researchers also found that the speed with which the rats returned to deliver a nose poke depended on not just the most recent reward, but on the last five rewards.
After experimenting with the rats for six weeks, the researchers applied lesions to different portions of some rats’ brains, after which the scientists found that the speed with which rats returned to restart the experiment became dependent much more on the previous reward.
The area researchers lesioned is the striatum, a part of the brain that interacts significantly with the hormone dopamine. Dysfunction of the dopamine pathway is strongly associated with Parkinson’s disease, a fatal degenerative disease that causes a breakdown of motor skills.
“Parkinson’s disease is often considered as a motor-deficient [disease] but...the new idea is that Parkinson’s disease patients may not be purely motor-deficient but more cognitive-deficient” Uchida said.
Uchida explained in an interview with the Harvard Gazette that it is possible that Parkinson’s disease may, in part, be caused by a lack of willingness to control motor function. This study, he said, could shed light on the regions of the brain controlling that motivation.
Alice Y. Wang, a research fellow at HMS and one of the authors of the study, said that she is interested in what the research indicates more generally about motivation.
“It speaks to the importance of our overall state—for our happiness in general” Wang said. “If you averaged everything in our life together, that’s what really motivates us.”

No longer just interesting for their dietary habits, carnivorous plants have recently attracted the attention of Harvard Forest researchers by offering insight into the early detection of irreversible water pollution.
By using small carnivorous plants to analyze oxygen depletion in aquatic ecosystems, a recent study by Harvard Forest researchers aims to foretell the amount of time before an ecosystem reaches its “tipping point” and is unable to restore its proper chemical balance.
Fertilizer, for instance, can overload a water environment with an abundance of nutrients, inducing large bursts in algae populations. This, in turn, causes an influx of predator-bacteria populations to bloom, depleting the once oxygen-rich water.
According to Aaron M. Ellison, a senior ecologist at Harvard Forest and co-author of the study, bringing bodies of water back from this state can be extremely intricate and difficult, prompting him and his research team to look for early warning signs.
“How much lead time do you need to prevent reaching that point? To turn pollution off and save the body of water?” Ellison said.
The researchers studied this process in carnivorous pitcher plants, which contain a water-filled pocket that allowed the researchers to compare pitcher plants to a body of water where larger organisms exist.
“Pitcher plants are ideal models of larger aquatic ecosystems because they contain a well-characterized food web,” Ellison said.
The other reason Ellison found pitcher plants ideal was because of their easy availability.
“If you go into a bog, there will be thousands of pitcher plants. You can have many individual replicates that make it easier to do experiments in controlled environments,” Ellison said.
To recreate organic pollution in their experiment, researchers added increments of ground-up wasp. The procedure continued until plants were no longer able to digest the material and their water system became overloaded.
The use of pitcher plants allowed Ellison and his team to study what would take generations to study in a full-size lake.
“In a pitcher plant, generations of bacteria go by in minutes. It’s like watching a lake for centuries,” Ellison said.
The study showed consistent results for all plants, providing further supporting evidence that a certain “tipping point” does exist—at the 45-hour mark, according to data in the study.
Ellison said he hopes that the results inspire others to become aware of the sensitive “tipping points” exhibited by ponds, lakes, and other bodies of water, and to act now to prevent such irreversible pollution.

Researchers at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute have discovered a hormone which may lead to new treatments for patients afflicted with diabetes.
In a study that was published in the journal Cell last Thursday, co-director of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute Professor Douglas A. Melton and postdoctoral fellow Peng Yi discovered that when a specific hormone called betatrophin was over-expressed in the tissues of mice, the production of beta cells in the pancreas dramatically increased.
Pancreatic beta cells are responsible for secreting insulin, the hormone required for the regulation of glucose. Levels of insulin are abnormally low in the bloodstreams of diabetic patients.
According to Yi, the same increase in beta cell production may occur in the pancreases of humans with abnormally high amounts of betatrophin because the gene that encodes betatrophin “has similar expression patterns” in mice and humans.
According to the researchers, this discovery may offer new treatment possibilities for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients, who according to the American Diabetes Association, number around 25 million in the United States alone. While current treatment plans for diabetes patients include frequent daily injections of insulin, the study’s results may significantly reduce or even eliminate the need for such injections.
“Our story suggests that if you inject betatrophin in [a] patient, you may have increased beta cell production,” Yi said. “This may help the diabetes patients.”
Melton and Yi are currently collaborating with the pharmaceutical companies Evotec and Janseen Pharmaceuticals to further research the potential implications of their results on the treatment of human patients.
Yi cautions, however, that much more work needs to be done to prove that increasing the level of betatrophin in patients is a valid mechanism of treating diabetes in humans.
“We’ve found something new with dramatic effects, but until we do something related to human beta cells, it is too early to say,” Yi said.
Nevertheless, Yi said that the discovery of betatrophin’s association with insulin secretion is a “promising” advancement in the development of treatments for diabetes.
Melton also described the encouraging nature of the results.
“I’ve never seen any treatment that causes such an enormous leap in beta cell replication,” Melton said in a recent press release.

The latest research conducted by Harvard Medical School researchers may revolutionize our current understanding of embryonic development. Specifically, a new study published last week in the journal Cell offers a new model to describe the way in which cells gain specific functions within the embryo.
The prevailing model of embryonic differentiation—a process in which infant cells develop specialized structures and functions—suggests that the identities assigned to cells are entirely determined by their location within the embryo.
“The textbook model is that the cells sit still, they listen for a signal, and then once they get the signal they adopt a fate,” said Sean G. Megason, assistant professor of systems biology at HMS and one of the study’s authors.
Megason’s team, however, found that this classic model was not completely consistent with their research, which suggests that the identity and function of an embryonic cell may be decided before the cell’s location is determined.
By studying the motion of embryonic zebrafish cells, the researchers observed cells undergoing differentiation before they moved into their proper positions.
“One thing that is quite intriguing is...they make the decision much earlier, before they get into their positions. That’s when it struck me that there is something unknown here,” said Fengzhu Xiong, lead author of the study and a graduate student in systems biology.
To make their observations, the team developed and utilized a new imaging and data analysis technique that allowed them to track the movement and changes of individual cells over time. As a result, the researchers were able to directly and closely observe how organs and tissues develop in the embryo.
“We’re using a type of microscopy that captures 3-D volumes, and then we do that over time, every couple minutes.” Megason said.
The team’s research sheds light into the processes by which all embryos develop the same set of complex structures, despite facing a wide variety of different genetic and environmental factors. The research may have important implications for the future of regenerative biology in the long run.
“If we’re to understand how we can ever make an organ, in vitro or in the laboratory, it’s important to understand how embryos actually do it, since embryos are so good at it,” Megason said.
Megason’s team will build on its findings to delve deeper into the mechanisms that govern the sorting of cells and the assignment of their functions.

Part Four of a five-part series on Harvard's approaching capital campaign. Part One was published on April 29, Part Two on April 30, Part Three on May 1, and Part Five on May 3.
As the September launch of Harvard’s multi-billion-dollar capital campaign approaches, top-level administrators and members of the University’s development office are targeting and schmoozing prominent donors in search of gifts for Harvard’s most ambitious fundraising effort in history.
Though the campaign is currently in the two-year “quiet phase,” during which administrators and other organizers gauge donor interest and predict total contributions, the work of soliciting donations from alumni and other supporters of Harvard is already eating into the jam-packed schedules of University leaders. And with the public launch of the five-year public campaign just four months away, the volume of that work is increasing.
For the people tasked with forging connections with donors and securing gifts for the campaign, the process is unpredictable and inexact. As they travel across the world to meet with potential donors in one-on-one encounters or deliver speeches to hundreds at a time, these officials find that the process demands nuance and finesse in the face of changing circumstances.
“It’s not a science, and it’s not an art,” said Tamara E. Rogers ’74, vice president for alumni affairs and development. “I like to think of it sort of as a craft, and maybe a bit of a sport.”
The background work that facilitates that effort generally begins with Rogers’s office. Members of Rogers’s team work to pinpoint potential donors by assessing attendance at Harvard Club events, tracking donation histories of University graduates and supporters, and dispatching staff members to meet with alumni and appraise their current relationship with Harvard.
From there, a development office staff member begins to meet with donors to understand their specific interests, which can range from strengthening a certain academic department to establishing a campus center. During these conversations, which can take place on campus, at Harvard clubs, or in other locations in cities across the globe, the Harvard representative also estimates the donor’s capacity to give.
The time that it takes to successfully solicit a donation varies drastically, from one meeting to a matter of years.
For particularly high-profile contributors, administrators and faculty members often step in to make Harvard’s case.
“If you’re going to inspire confidence and build a relationship with someone such that they would want to support the institution, it does take time from deans, and from the president, and from the provost,” Rogers said, adding that the most prominent donors often expect to work with Harvard’s administrative leaders.
For University leaders, that task sometimes involves extensive travel.
“Most of my travel is related to fundraising,” said Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, who travels for around two to three days every six weeks.
But University President Drew G. Faust, Garber added, spends even more time making contact with donors.
When Faust traveled to Hong Kong and Seoul, South Korea, in March for various meetings and speeches, her itineraries in both cities included events with hundreds of alumni. Faust cited that trip and others, such as her January visit to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, as chances for her to connect with donors.
For administrators with already busy schedules, the “degree of labor intensity” involved in securing contributions “can come as a bit of a surprise,” Rogers said.
The main reason that fundraising takes so much time, Faust said, is the need to form relationships with potential donors.
“The gift comes out of many, many, many, many interactions,” she said. “Fundraising is very time-consuming in that way.”
Faust said that, above all, she considers the fundraising process to be one centered around establishing connections.
“You don’t just walk up to somebody who you think has a lot of capacity and an interest in Harvard and say, ‘Hello, it’s nice to meet you. Will you give me an enormous gift?’” Faust said. “Instead, you develop a relationship with someone over a long period of time and get to know what their interests are, get them to trust you, get them to believe in what you want for the University and your aspirations for the University.”
And with the campaign soon to emerge from its quiet phase, administrators said that the time they spend fundraising will only increase.
“I’ve been told that it will happen even more,” Faust said. “My time will be increasingly called upon for events, activities, visits [and] focus on the campaign.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In order to address concerns of declining student enrollment in the humanities, the Harvard Arts and Humanities Division is preparing to release an in-depth report analyzing trends in the humanities and recommending ways to rekindle undergraduate interest in the liberal arts.
The report is a product of The Humanities Project, an 18-month collaboration among Harvard faculty commissioned by Dean of the Arts and Humanities Diana Sorensen. According to Sorensen, the project aims “to create much more of a culture of interaction and support and general interest in some of the big questions that humanists address.”
According to chair of the Department of Slavic Languages and Literature Julie A. Buckler, who was a member of the project’s original steering committee, The Humanities Project aims to bridge departmental gaps and encourage interdisciplinary collaboration.
“I see this as a multi-initiative divisional process that will unfold over the next several years,” Buckler said. “Each department and program will contribute and participate in ways that fit them, and yet there will be a growing sense of a common divisional culture and common divisional purposes.”
The document consists of three separate parts, two of which were written by working committees involved with The Humanities Project. The first analyzes trends in the history of the humanities and looks to the field’s future, and the second contains suggestions for curricular innovation in the arts and humanities. In the third piece, Director of the Mahindra Humanities Center Homi K. Bhabha shares his perspective on the outlook for the humanities.
English Department Chair W. James Simpson, who worked on the first part of the document, said that although the report makes use of both national and University-wide statistics, it is essentially a meditation on the state of the humanities.
“The [report] is driven by reflective arguments about where humanities have come from, where they are, and where they might go. It’s driven by philosophical reflection rather than data,” Simpson said.
In response to the suggestions for curricular innovation, other faculty involved with the collaborative effort have developed three framework courses that, pending approval from the General Education Committee, will be introduced to the course catalog next academic year: “The Art of Listening,” “The Art of Looking,” and “The Art of Reading.”
“We’re trying to point to what seems to be very straightforward activities and experiences, and yet show how being truly thoughtful about them equips you to function in a much more lucid way, both on campus and then afterwards in the world,” said Sorensen.
Due to the events surrounding the Boston Marathon bombings, the release of the report was postponed. The report will be presented to FAS Dean Michael D. Smith and University President Drew G. Faust in the next few weeks, and Sorensen said that she hopes the report will be made available to the public on the Arts and Humanities website by mid-May.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Patrons at Hemenway Gymnasium exercised for a cause Wednesday as the gym dedicated its 19 treadmills to a fundraising effort in honor of participants at this year’s Boston Marathon.
Runners were asked to donate 26 dollars for a 26-minute session on the machine—just one of many efforts on campus to raise money for The One Fund, established by Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 and Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino to support families affected by the Boston Marathon bombings, which killed three and injured more than 170 last month.
“We’ve housed people that have been training for a year for this,” said Katherine E. Egan, assistant general manager of Hemenway Gym. “We felt like this building and these walls really had a bruise on them from what had happened. We wanted to give back somehow, not just to the cause, but also to our members.”
Although the gym quieted down after a midday rush, a steady trickle of patrons continued to filter in throughout the afternoon, and a basket of raffle tickets—one given for every dollar donated—filled up quickly.
“I didn’t have time to run 26 minutes, but I might come back later with my friends.” said Bobby T. Fitzpatrick, Jr. ’16. “It makes it seem so doable to run for 26 minutes, especially compared to 26 miles.”
Dunster House resident tutor Kirstin W. Scott had just completed the marathon when the first bomb went off at the finish line. In the immediate chaos of the attacks, she remembers “hugging strangers,” trying to support those around her, and feeling helpless.
Looking for a way to contribute to relief efforts afterwards, she ordered one thousand wristbands inscribed with “All in For Boston”—an encouraging phrase posted along the marathon route. The supplier doubled the order for no charge.
“If you donate five dollars to The One Fund, I’ll send you a wristband,” Scott said. “Once we run out of our two thousand bands, I’ll feel comfortable saying we’ve raised about ten thousand dollars for The One Fund, at a minimum.”
Student groups have been working to support those affected at the Marathon as well. Profits from the Presencia Latina cultural show, which took place the weekend after the bombings, were redirected towards The One Fund after organizers wanted to contribute to the local community.
“We live in Cambridge, yeah, but we’re part of Boston...It’s our hometown, at least for these four years,” said Presencia Latina director Maricela Lupercio ’15. “After everything that happened, we felt that money should go somewhere more purposeful.”
The Asian American Christian Fellowship plans to donate 700 dollars, or roughly one-third of the profits from its annual “servant auction,” to The One Fund. The money will come out of its service trip scholarships, but the group plans to offset the impact with additional fundraising efforts.
“At Harvard, students are very privileged and have a lot of resources, provided either by students or by the school,” said Yelun D. Qin ’10, an AACF staff member. “It’s just a small step to giving back to the immediate community.”

Young adults aged 18 to 29, also known as the millennial generation, have an increased distrust in every political institution except the military, according to a biannual Institute of Politics report released Tuesday. Written and analyzed by students, the report also showed an increased polarization among party lines since the election and split opinions about gun regulation.
C. M. Trey Grayson ’94, director of the Institute of Politics, said he was particularly alarmed by the long-term implications of the poll’s results, explaining that the support of the millennials is key to the future stability of modern American institutions like the media, local and federal governments, and Wall Street.
“You hope the process can work, the system can work, politics can work,” Grayson said. “We’ve got to give millennials a reason to trust these institutions.”
Fifty-three percent of respondents said they were concerned with the moral direction of the country, and 47 percent said they felt that the political system is no longer capable of overcoming the challenges the nation faces.
“That’s disappointing, especially because we know that people’s political attitudes are often greatly impacted at the beginning of their adulthood, when they enter the political process,” Grayson said about the report’s overall findings.
Results also indicated that nearly half of millennials do not believe their votes will make a real difference, and over half believe their interests are not shared by elected officials.
Harvard Public Opinion Project generated the poll’s questions, analyzed the resulting data, and wrote up the report.
According to HPOP student chair Eva A. Guidarini ’15, a recent election would typically result in a higher feeling of participation and support among the voting coalition. Yet the results of the report only show millennials feeling isolated and frustrated, she said.
“Young people, they’re not really influencing Obama’s policies in office,” Guidarini said, explaining the lack of post-election optimism. “They just helped him get there.”
Guidarini noted that the millennial demographic is often associated with issues they actually care about the least, including foreign policy and climate change. Instead, the report found that millennials care most about creating jobs, lowering unemployment rates, and improving the education system.
“Millennials and young people, they get talked about as a breakout group only concerned with their own issues,” said Colin J. F. Diersing ’16, a member of HPOP. “They’re also normal human beings who want jobs and to make money.”
Grayson explained that institutional failures have largely been responsible for Washington’s neglect of the demographic’s concerns.
“Millennials have been hit hard,” Grayson said. “The job market is tight, and so the unemployment rate is higher, as well as the underemployment rate.”
Grayson explained that a lack of bipartisanship has been a major cause of legislative breakdown, and that this divisiveness could permanently shape millenials’ understanding of politics and the government.
Indeed, results of the report showed increasingly polarized opinions about President Obama’s term thus far. 85 percent of Democrats approve of President Obama’s job, while only 11 percent of young Republicans do. The division of the government was even reflected in the social lives of the Millennials. Only 12 percent said that their most recent significant other did not share their political beliefs, while 72 percent reported that all or most of their friends do.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Blood splattered across the shoulders of boxer Robert Z. Cai ’14 on Wednesday night as he continued throwing punches despite a bleeding nose.
Over the course of 11 match-ups during the fifth Kenneth Moskow Memorial Fight Night on Wednesday, Cai’s was the most notable bloody nose of the evening.
“I’m a bleeder, I bleed easily,” Cai said after the match, adding that “we fight hard today since we’re fighting for the public, but we wouldn’t go quite so hard in sparring.”
Fight Night—an annual showcase of the Harvard Boxing Club—moved from the Malkin Athletic Center for the first time this year, to the more public, open-air tent that is currently set up over the newly renovated Science Center Plaza. At the event, the Boxing Club collected donations for the One Fund, a campaign started by Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 and Boston mayor Thomas M. Menino to support those hurt by the Boston Marathon bombings.
Students, faculty, and community members paused to watch the fights as they passed by the elevated boxing ring.
Kyle K. Courtney, a librarian at the Law School, said he was surprised by the location.
“There was an email that said that this was going to be at the Science Center, so I was wondering if it was going to be inside the Science Center, but then I saw the trucks bring out the platform this morning on my way to work,” he said. “If this is the result of the Science Center being redone, I’m all for the Plaza. I’m a fan of this sport, and always love to see it live.”
Boxers were announced by their fight name, hometown, and a brief musical snippet of their choice. The fans cheered on their friends, teammates, and teachers by chanting the nicknames of the fighters.
“Traditionally in any fight sport, you get to pick your own fight name and a fight song,” said Cai, who goes by 'Supafly.' “They can mean something to you or it can be funny. I wanted to be funny, so my fight song is the Harlem Shake.”
Boxers have had a place at Harvard since the 1870s. One of the University’s most famous fighters was Theodore Roosevelt, Class of 1880, and the sport was a requirement during World War II. Although house boxing tournaments were suspended in 1976 due to uncontrollably rowdy crowds, Wednesday night’s spectators were more respectful.
“When you think about boxing and Harvard, they occupy two different spheres,” said Brandon Ogbunu, a postdoctoral fellow in the organismic and evolutionary biology department who spent five years coaching boxing at Yale. “Harvard is civilized and sophisticated, and [many think] boxing is the opposite. To people who know the history of the sport, though, that’s not true.”
Boxer and extension school student Mencius 'El Matador' Hicks agreed that the sport is reflective of traditional Harvard values.
“It is a good way to get in shape and to do something competitive,” Hicks said. “Boxing is a test of courage and an excellent metaphor for how you handle pressure.”

In pithy TED Talks fashion, four seniors shared anecdotes about Nicaraguan funerals, failed start-ups, and the behind-the-scenes workings of the Undergraduate Council Wednesday night at the final Harvard Undergraduates Speak event of the semester.
“These are voices that the underclassmen won’t get to hear again,” said Meredith C. Baker ’13, co-president of HarvardSpeaks and an inactive Crimson editorial editor.
In his speech, former UC president Danny P. Bicknell ’13 called Harvard a “decentralized, bureaucratic institution.” But Bicknell’s critique was balanced with an encouragement to students to constructively address concerns by attending focus groups with administrators and reaching out to UC representatives.
“It’s just frustrating when students missed an opportunity to get involved when they could have sent an email or filled out a poll,” he told The Crimson after his remarks.
Speakers also shared stories about their academic experiences both on- and off-campus.
Tyler E. Logigian ’13 told the audience about how he stumbled upon his thesis topic of HIV and AIDS in South Africa through a series of seemingly unrelated experiences, including a “Nicaraguan funeral... a brilliant Turkish postdoctoral fellow taking a cigarette break outside Robinson Hall... and coffee with a world-renowned South African anthropologist.”
B. Marjorie Gullick ’13, a Crimson sports editor, discussed her work on maternal healthcare and child nutrition in Africa. “I want this to be a story about the empowerment of two groups of people that deserve to recognize their fundamental right to health,” she said.
Nancy Y. Xie ’13 took a different angle, tackling a topic she said Harvard students may not be too familiar with.
“I decided that it may be more interesting for you for me to talk about something that may be a more lesser-known phenomenon at Harvard College: failure,” she said. Citing lost extracurricular elections and unsuccessful attempts at the recruiting process and a start-up, Xie said that failures at Harvard have taught her the value of humility.
Underclassmen in the audience used the talks as an opportunity for reflection as well. “Me being a junior now, I can kind of see that I’m going to be in their shoes next year, and I want to make the most of it,” said Dong Ik Lee ’14.
HarvardSpeaks hopes to help students practice their public speaking skills and build a community where speakers feel comfortable sharing novel ideas. Speeches are posted online to reach a wider audience—one video from a talk in February has already garnered more than 56,000 views.
“You’re not just speaking so people come and listen to you, it’s not self-congratulatory,” said outgoing co-president Eliza L. Malkin ’13, who plans to stay involved with the group after graduating. “It’s speaking for a reason, it’s speaking to bond and expand as a community.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Speaking to a packed crowd at the Graduate School of Education Wednesday night, linguist Noam Chomsky and other panelists argued for an education model that promotes a reciprocal relationship between teacher and student.
The panelists evoked the work of Brazilian philosopher and educator Paulo Freire in calling for reform of the so-called “banking” model of education, a pedagogical approach in which teaching is viewed as a top-down endeavor. Chomsky said that teachers who abide by this model see teaching to students as similar to pouring water into a vessel.
“It’s a very leaky vessel,” Chomsky said. “You can study for a test, pass the test, and forget what the test was about.“
Instead, Chomsky said, educators should follow Freire’s lead in striving to do away with the dichotomy between student and teacher.
Wednesday’s panel was organized to celebrate the 45th anniversary of Freire’s influential book “Pedagogy of the Oppressed.” Chomsky was joined by Ed School professor Howard E. Gardner and Bruno della Chiesa, a visiting lecturer at the Ed School.
Throughout the discussion, Chomsky and della Chiesa emphasized the central role that literacy plays in Freire’s work in raising self-consciousness. Chomsky cited Kerala, the southwest region of India, which holds the country’s highest literacy rate, highest life expectancy, and lowest fertility rate. Although the example did not directly draw from Freire’s teachings, Chomsky said it demonstrated Freire’s point that literacy encourages students to learn who they are and control of their lives.
Gardner also read aloud from the introduction of the 30th anniversary edition of “The Pedagogy of the Oppressed, in which Donaldo Macedo, a professor at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, directly criticizes the Graduate School of Education for leaving Freire out of the curriculum.
During a question-and-answer session at the end of the forum, an audience member questioned why Freire’s work was not more widely taught at the Graduate School of Education.
Chomsky, an emeritus MIT professor, said that MIT’s intellectual environment promotes Freire’s philosophy.
At MIT, he said, “Science would die if there was not conscious constant questioning.”

Speaking at a panel discussion at the Walter Lippmann House Wednesday evening, several professional journalists said that Twitter fundamentally shaped the way they covered the Boston Marathon bombings and the ensuing shootout and manhunt.
The panel, entitled “Timing, Trust, and Credibility in the Age of Twitter,” was hosted by the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard and brought together journalists who played a key role in reporting the events that unfolded in Boston in the past few weeks.
Boston Globe reporter and 2013 Nieman Fellow David Abel said he tweeted throughout the afternoon on the day of the bombings.
“For me, Twitter became an outlet that I don’t necessarily have as a reporter, where I’m writing in third-person,” Abel said. “The story that was written was shaped through my tweets.”
Seth Mnookin, co-director of MIT’s Graduate Program in Science Writing, said that Twitter’s timestamps made his coverage of the manhunt so precise that he used his tweets as notes for his reporting.
“It’s a really powerful way to find sources and reach people that you wouldn’t normally,” Mnookin said.
Panelists also discussed the role of the citizen journalist in the bombing coverage.
As thousands of laypeople turned to social media such as Twitter, Reddit, and Facebook to disperse and learn information about the tragedy, rumors and false reports spread quickly.
In such an environment, panelists said, it became more important than ever for professional journalists to get the facts right.
“When there were mistakes made by credible institutions in this case, it was devastating,” said Callie Crossley, host of WGBH’s “Under the Radar.”
“We had to be very cautious,” said panelist David Beard, engagement editor at the Washington Post. “We mobilized from afar and tried to do the right sort of sourcing...we had to figure out who didn’t know, and who did.”
While panelists said that social media increased the likelihood of speculation, misreporting, and the loss of journalistic credibility. Mnookin said that Twitter can somewhat paradoxically help reporters improve their image.
“One way that we can get more credible as journalists is by being more transparent about the whole process,” Mnookin said.
“One of the things that’s happening with Twitter is that the whole [journalistic] process that we do is being demystified,” he added.
Jennifer Peter, deputy managing editor for local news at the Boston Globe, agreed, saying that Twitter offered exciting new possibilities in journalistic coverage.
“There were pitfalls, but it was an incredible vibrant way to watch what was happening,” said.
“As a journalist, I feel that Twitter has given us a very valuable new tool, if used properly,” Peter added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming into the final weekend against Dartmouth, the Harvard sofball team had to take three of four to emerge the title winner. The Big Green came out victorious, splitting Saturday’s doubleheader and sweeping Sunday’s. With that, Harvard’s three-year North Division title streak came to an end.
For the first time since 2009, the Crimson did not win its division title and did not make it to the Ivy League Softball Championship Series.
Though one streak was broken this season, another—likely to be forgotten in the grand scheme of things—was made.
Through 11 straight games in the middle of April, the Crimson was undefeated. No team in the Ivy League—including Division Champions Dartmouth and Penn—pulled off such a feat.
An unlikely achievement by an unlikely group, the 11-game win streak highlights the story of Harvard’s season and the payoff of a season’s work by a team in transition.
After a 10-7 loss to Cornell in the first game of a doubleheader on Apr. 6, the Crimson came back with an 11-2 victory and would not lose again until Apr. 27. Before the second game against the Big Red, Harvard held a 10-17 record on the season and had lost three of its last four.
Coming into the 2013 season, the Crimson faced a lot of question marks, both at the plate and in the circle.
Harvard was forced to adjust to the loss of its two main pitchers, Rachel Brown and Laura Ricciardone, and instead rely on a trio of young, inexperienced players to fill the void. Last season, Brown sported a league-leading 1.40 ERA in 200 innings pitched, while Ricciardone finished third among qualified pitchers with a 1.72 ERA. The duo combined for a 35-13 record and pitched 314 of the Crimson’s 339.1 innings.
In addition to Brown and Ricciardone, the Crimson took the field without 2012’s team-leading hitter, Jane Alexander. Alexander hit .381 in 50 games and topped the Ivy League with 61 hits.
Starting in March, the Harvard softball team took on the tall task of replacing what it lost. The Crimson relied on a young trio of pitchers made up of freshmen Morgan Groom and Jamie Halula and sophomore Gabriele Ruiz. Veterans Shelbi Olson, Kasey Lange, and Stephanie Regan stepped up as leaders at the plate.
By the time it entered Ivy League play at the end of March, Harvard had racked up a 7-12 non-conference record. The Crimson had lost a number of close games and was frustrated by an inability to string hits together and shut down small mistakes.
But with the talented, albeit inexperienced rotation, and deep lineup, the pieces inevitably began to fall into place.
In April, the team finally reached its potential. Over 11 games, Harvard outscored its opponents, 74-38, and tallied 31 extra-base hits in a balanced offensive effort that started with unshakable pitching.
The Crimson finished Ivy League play as the second hottest-hitting team in the conference with a .312 combined batting average and a .382 on base percentage. Without dominant power hitting, Harvard relied on its speed on the base paths, stealing a league-high 42 bases.
Led by the dominant performances of Lange—who topped the league in RBI and placed second in slugging percentage and home runs—and Olson, Harvard tore through its Ivy League opponents one by one, including a four-game sweep of Yale. The Crimson also picked up three wins against Brown and non-conference victories over Quinnipiac and Boston University.
Eventually it had to end. In the fourth game of a four-game series against Brown, Harvard went up, 3-0, in the second and held a two- or three-run lead until the final inning. But when Brown loaded the bases with one out in the bottom of the seventh, the Crimson could not contain the damage, and two walks and a wild pitch brought the game—and the win streak—to a close.
Though the streak came to an end, the success of the young team is only just beginning. Of the three seniors who will graduate, only Stephanie Regan is in the starting lineup on a regular basis. Regan plays in the outfield occasionally but is usually the designated hitter, so the Crimson’s defensive lineup will remain intact.
With a full collegiate season under their belts, Groom, Halula and Ruiz are only poised to improve, and with a consistent lineup, Harvard will likely be better equipped to clean up pitching errors with defense and improved situational hitting.
For 16 days in the middle of April, the Harvard softball team showed what it was capable of, a performance that previews bigger things to come.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the Crimson facing No. 18 Washington in the biggest game in Harvard softball history, there was one player the Crimson coaching staff could trust to face down the Huskies.
“In some ways on the mound, [Rachel Brown] was a security blanket for us—we knew Rachel would keep us in every game,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard says. “That was a great feeling to have: Every time you showed up and Rachel was on the mound, you knew you were going to be in the game.”
As a co-captain and two-time Ivy League Pitcher of the Year, Brown had led the Crimson to its second consecutive Ivy League title and now to an NCAA regional final, further than any Ancient Eight team since 1996.
Brown pitched the complete game and held the Huskies to one run in the first three innings. But Harvard’s offense was unable to get on the board and succumbed to a 4-0 shutout.
“I have no regrets about my senior season,” Brown says. “I think my senior class was on a mission, and each year we wanted to improve. In our final regional tournament we had a really great showing for Harvard softball.”
The loss to the Huskies was Brown’s final game and ended one of the most decorated Crimson softball careers of all time. For the rest of the senior class, it was the end of the most successful four years in Harvard history.
“You have got a lot of pride as a coach to see how players grow over their career,” Allard says. “It’s not what they accomplished in one particular year. The success that last year’s team had in getting to a regional final wasn’t just one year’s success, it was four years’. It was because Rachel Brown got better over four years…all those seniors got better over four years.”
THE GRADUATE
However, for Rachel, the Washington game was not to be the end of her softball career. The game she had played her entire life and had such success with was something she was not quite ready to part with.
Instead of retiring, Rachel became an assistant coach with the Stony Brook Seawolves.
“I wasn’t quite ready to give the sport up,” Brown says. “It had been such a huge part of my life, and so this [position] seemed like a great opportunity to kind of stay involved, and it’s also a great opportunity while I’m working on my master's as well.”
Amidst her job as assistant coach, Brown is pursuing a Master's in Higher Education Administration through the School of Professional Development at Stony Brook.
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE POND
Before the coaching job opened up, Brown had chosen an unusual path for the standard Harvard graduate. Immediately after graduation, she packed up her bags and headed to Sweden for four months to play for the Skövde Saints.
“It was an incredible experience,” Brown says. “I got to be a kind of player-coach because the sport is really underdeveloped there. So it was both fun, and it was an incredible opportunity.”
Under Brown’s leadership the Saints had a very successful season, winning the European B Cup in Ostrava, Czech Republic. The team went 8-1, with Rachel pitching every game and reclaiming a spot for the side in the 2013 European A Cup.
From that success, the team returned to Swedish League play where it had snuck into the playoffs as the four seed with a 7-9 record. Up against longtime rivals Sundsvall, the momentum from European competition easily saw Skövde through.
And so it ended up that the last competitive game Brown pitched was game four of the Swedish Softball League Championship Series  against Leksand. One final dominant performance gave Skövde the win and Brown something she never thought she would win growing up: a Swedish national softball championship.
“The competition level was not nearly as high [as during my collegiate career], and I got to work with some players who had just recently started playing the sport,” Brown says. “But it reminded me why I really love the sport, and I got to give back.”
ON THE SIDELINES
From there, Brown headed to Stony Brook to transition into the next phase of her softball career as a coach.
“What really interested me the most about Rachel was that she knows what it takes to excel academically, athletically, and personally in a challenging university environment,” says Stony Brook coach Megan Bryant. “We strive for excellence in all three of those components here at Stony Brook, and it is important that our coaches share that vision for the student-athletes in our program.”
According to Allard, Brown was the kind of player who would make a good coach. She had an attention to detail and a knack for amendment which suited her for life on the sidelines.
“Rachel and I spent a lot of time in the bullpen together. I was her pitching coach on the staff,” Allard says. “Rachel was a very crafty pitcher. She knew the motions. She knew when stuff was working, and when it wasn’t. If something wasn’t going well, she really could make adjustments very quickly to her motion and her technique, which is very difficult because the pitching motion is so complex.”
Over the past year, Brown has become a popular and integral member of the Stony Brook program, focusing her efforts on the three pitchers she works with primarily.
One time in the fall, when the other coaches were away on recruiting visits, Brown had the team to herself. In what she called one of the most fun experiences of her year as a coach, she organized a home-run derby between the pitchers and catchers and the rest of the squad. To everyone’s amazement and Rachel’s secret delight, it was to be the pitchers and catchers who came out on top.
“Rachel has been a terrific addition not only to our softball program, but also to the Stony Brook Athletic Department and the University community,” Bryant says. “She comes to work each day with a smile on her face and her sleeves rolled up.  It is a bit of ‘baptism by fire’ to go from college player to Division I coach in a matter of months, but Rachel is up to the task.”
SWITCH HITTING
The switch from player to coach does not happen overnight, and Brown’s experience was no exception.
“I am learning a lot this year because as a player, there are a lot of things that happen behind the scenes that you don’t see,” Brown says. “As a player, a coach tells you do certain things and you do them. But as a coach, you have to really think about practice plans or certain technical skills, and you also have to do a lot of problem solving. As a pitcher, I was very focused on what I was doing; but as a coach, I have to think of all three of the pitchers that I work with and really help them to improve.”
Game situations, too, are a completely different ballgame. Not being able to directly affect the outcome can be somewhat taxing for the rookie coach.
“I’m a little more stressed out than I was as a player,” Brown says. “I call pitches, but I have no control over what the end result is, and that has been a little bit challenging. I’m really lucky to work with a great coaching staff, and all the athletes are really great players, so it’s been a pretty smooth transition.”
With Brown as part of the family, Stony Brook has enjoyed a successful season and will be headed to the America East Championship playoffs next weekend. Indeed, before a recent trio of losses against Binghamton, the Seawolves were sporting an unbeaten 12-0 home record.
HOME FIELD ADVANTAGE
Brown is excited about the upcoming postseason and the success of her new team. However, she says the school she called home for four years will always have a special place in her heart.
“Rachel was a very vested player,” Allard says. “She really cared about her teammates. She really cared about the program, even to this day. I just got an e-mail from Rachel yesterday, and she stays connected to everybody. She has stayed with Harvard softball through this year.”
After four years at Harvard, Brown developed a real bond with the program.
“I am very regularly in contact with [the players],” Brown adds, laughing. “I joke that I am still living vicariously through them. I follow all the games and talk to all the players. I’m also in contact with my coaches now that I can appreciate a lot more what they have done now that I am going through the same thing.”
Indeed, it is that very bond which ultimately inspired her decision to become a coach.
Coaching was a natural progression for Brown. It not only kept her involved with the game she loves, but also handed her the opportunity to create for others the experience that she and her teammates had cherished.
“Looking back, when I think about Harvard, I think about Harvard softball,” Brown says. “It was really the defining experience of my college career. That was a big part of the reason why I wanted to stay involved in college athletics because I know how great the experience of college sports is, and so if I can create that experience for other student athletes here, then I will consider my job a huge success.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It may be the offseason, but it doesn't seem that way for the Harvard football team.
 
Players have risen early for morning practice four days a week to prepare themselves for the upcoming season, and coaches have been working to assess the state of the team following a second-place finish in the Ivy League in the fall.
 
Perhaps the most glaring departure from that squad is senior quarterback Colton Chapple. With Chapple at the helm, the Harvard offense had a record-setting 2012 season, finishing fourth in the country with 487 yards per game.
 
Chapple, who was named Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year his senior season, set Harvard records in both touchdowns and total yards.
 
Although the cornerstone of the Crimson's offense will no longer be behind center, Harvard coach Tim Murphy believes he has two capable replacements in rising senior Michael Pruneau and rising junior Conner Hempel. The starting quarterback position remains up for grabs, and the two have competed for the job and will continue to do so throughout the summer.
 
Both players have received little playing time in their Harvard football careers. Hempel appeared in only three games last year, after the outcomes were all but decided. In those games, he went a combined 15-for-24 in the air with no touchdowns and one interception.
 
Pruneau has not taken a snap since 2011, having suffered an ACL injury that sidelined him for the entirety of the fall season. In two games as a sophomore, Pruneau went 4-for-11 with a touchdown and one interception.
 
"I think we have two really good quarterbacks," Murphy said. "I'll preface that by saying [that] realistically neither guy's really ever taken a snap. So that's based upon ability. I mean, those kids can do all the things we ask our quarterbacks to do. They're dual threats, they've got live arms, [and] they're bigger, athletic guys. So potentially we've got two really solid quarterbacks."
 
Hempel saw considerable playing time during the annual spring game last Saturday, leading his Crimson team on 11 individual drives. The rising junior finished 13-for-22 for 113 yards, spreading the ball around to several different receivers. His best throw came on a 23-yard completion down the sideline to rising junior receiver Seitu Smith.
 
"[In the spring game] you have real fans; you're actually having real drives," Hempel said. "Practices are normally scripted, so you know what plays you're going to be running, but this is all purely a game situation. So the more experience you can get, the better."
 
Pruneau, still recovering from his ACL injury, did not appear in the spring game, but instead remained on the sideline next to Murphy and occasionally relayed plays in. The rising senior has been rehabbing throughout the entire spring semester, and he has avoided full contact drills.
 
"[The recovery has] come along great," Pruneau said. "I'm feeling almost 100 percent. At this point, I'm trying to gain full strength back in my leg. The rehab process is coming to an end here…. At some point during the summer I'll be back to full health."
 
Although Pruneau has not been able to practice at full speed in 11-on-11 situations, he has certainly worked hard throughout the spring season. Both he and Hempel have repeatedly shown up early for morning practice to watch film and get in extra reps.
 
In the end, both QBs agree that the competition for the starting job can only help the team in the months leading up to the fall.
 
"We feed off of each other; we motivate each other," Hempel said. "Mike's a great quarterback, and I really enjoy being around him and in meetings with him. We study film together with [offensive coordinator Joel] Lamb. It's a healthy competition, and it's making the team better."
 
"Ever since I've been here, there's always been a good relationship among the QBs, and I don't think it's going to change anytime soon," Pruneau added. "Me and Conner are friends, and I see us feeding off each other. I think ultimately it'll be beneficial to the team."
 
Harvard has three other quarterbacks on its active roster. Rising sophomore Tanner Wrisley played extensively during the spring game, and classmates Jimmy Meyer and Scott Hosch also received several snaps.
 
But Hempel and Pruneau stand out to Murphy as the top candidates for the starting job. Although Pruneau's injury has made evaluations difficult, the head coach lists Hempel at the top of the depth chart, crediting his performance in spring ball.
 
"It's an open competition, but having said that, somebody's one, somebody's two, and somebody's three," Murphy said. "And Conner, coming out of spring football, has earned number one. Michael has earned number two because that's where he was, but based upon limited reps, that's how it's going to start off."
 
Murphy says he hopes to have named a starting quarterback ten days before the first game of the year against San Diego.
 
But whoever takes the field for the first snap on September 21—regardless of whether it is Hempel or Pruneau—will be tasked with leading the Crimson on its quest for a fourth Ivy League title in seven years.
 
"Talentwise, I think we have everything it takes, but the key ingredient is everyone coming together as a team," Hempel said. "Leaders start to emerge, and the leadership and how we play together and the chemistry on the team are what's ultimately going to decide how successful we'll be in the upcoming season."

Apparently, Oprah is right: "Happiness is love." Or so says George E. Vaillant '55, director of the Harvard-based Grant Study, which has followed 268 Harvard men over 75 years in one of the longest longitudinal studies of its kind.
Started in 1938 as an "attempt to analyze the forces that have produced normal young men," the study has been specializing in what some may call TMI for decades. From date of toilet training to length of scrotum (we're serious), researchers have tracked almost every conceivable detail of these guys for decades, all in an attempt to uncover the origins of happiness (or at least normalcy).
 While a Crimson article from 1942 reveals some of the study's vaguely creepy overtones (the original goal was apparently "to draw up a formula which will easily and correctly guide a man to his proper place in the world's society"), its recent conclusions, catalogued in Vaillant's book Triumphs of Experience, are actually pretty uplifting. Some zingers, as revealed in the Atlantic: apparently, IQ becomes unimportant above a certain level, older male liberals have more sex than their conservative counterparts, and those reporting the most satisfaction in relationships made an average of $141,000 more a year.
  So does this study hold key to happiness for everyone? Maybe—if everyone is a "normal" male with a Harvard degree.
