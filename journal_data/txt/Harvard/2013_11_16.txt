After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The names of the 48 seniors elected to Harvard’s chapter of Phi Beta Kappa this semester were announced on Friday by Jeffrey Berg, assistant director of the Harvard College Office of Undergraduate Research and Fellowships.
This election cycle marked the second opportunity for members of the Class of 2014 to join the prestigious honor society.
In April, a group of two dozen students, then juniors, were named as this year’s Phi Beta Kappa “Junior 24.” A third group of likely 96 seniors will be chosen this coming spring.
“I think there are a lot of people who probably deserve it a lot more than I, but obviously it’s a great honor, and I was very excited,” said David A. Levary, an applied mathematics concentrator in Cabot.
Eliot House resident and East Asian Studies concentrator Midori Takasaki said she was in disbelief when she heard that she had been chosen. 
“It didn’t seem real when I got the email,” Takasaki said.
Adams and Lowell had the most seniors elected this semester with eight apiece, while Pforzheimer, Dunster, and Dudley had the least with one student each. Six of the selected students concentrate in applied math, the most common concentration in this year’s group. In contrast, social studies was the most popular concentration in the first round this past spring, with five of the 24 students concentrating in that subject.
While seniors are selected primarily based on their grades, the committee also considers the difficulty and diversity of courses taken. In addition to their transcript, candidates submitted a letter of recommendation from a professor.
Barry J. H. Tng, a mathematics concentrator in Currier, said that although the committee’s decision process is somewhat unclear, he thinks that the range of classes he has taken outside of his concentration may have helped him stand out as a candidate.
Takasaki, who said she considered as many as 10 different concentrations before settling on East Asian Studies, also said that diversity in her coursework may have pushed her ahead. 
“I think I’ve always had a lot of different academic interests, and I think I still do just genuinely like learning about different academic subjects,” she said. 
Several members of the most recent group of seniors selected to join Phi Beta Kappa said that younger students should choose courses based on their content rather than on their workload.
“I think you should just work hard and study what you’re interested in, and good things will come if you’re excited about what you’re learning,” Levary said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After scoring 43 goals in an illustrious four-year career at Harvard, Kate Buesser ’11 now has one at the international level for Team U.S.A. women’s hockey. Her score was the first of an eight-goal onslaught against Sweden that earned the U.S. National team a third place result at the Four Nations Cup.
 
Coming into U.S. Olympic women’s ice hockey selection camp, Kate Buesser ’11 didn’t expect to make the squad at all. She even had thoughts of giving up her dream of playing in the Olympics. But in late June of this year, Buesser was named to the 2013-2014 U.S. Women’s National Team as one of the five current or former Harvard players that would compete under Crimson women’s ice hockey coach Katey Stone.
 
But regardless of whether she will make the final cut for 2014 Olympic team in a month, Buesser had one of the highlights of her career this past Saturday.
 
After a botched face-off eight and a half minutes into the first period, U.S forward Monique Lamoureux swung the puck over to Buesser, who stuffed it into the net to spark the U.S. to give the squad a 1-0 lead. The floodgates opened from there, as the players decked in red, white, and blue scored seven more goals and took 59 shots on the day.
 
USA had beaten Sweden four days prior, but fell to Canada, 4-2, and Finland, 3-1, in the meantime to set up a third place showdown this past Saturday.
 
But the cheering by the U.S. bench after Buesser’s goal made it seem like the championship clincher. To make the storyline happier was the fact that Buesser’s family was there to see it all unfold.
 
For Buesser, the next step is making the final Sochi Winter Olympics squad. U.S. Ice Hockey will cut down the roster from 25 to 21 players in the next month or so. Scoring against Sweden was another step for Buesser in making her dream of making the squad into reality.
 "You always hear never give up on your dreams and to be honest I did for a while," Buesser said to USA Hockey. "But when you come back around and realize what you play the game for and to take the chances when you can it's a great feeling."

When the Harvard Football team (7-1, 4-1 Ivy) welcomes Penn (4-4, 3-2 Ivy) for its Senior Day on Saturday, the fate of the Ancient Eight will once again be in the balance. The Crimson finds its Ivy League title chances resting on a win against the Quakers, as a victory and Princeton loss would put Harvard in first place. Nonetheless, there are no guarantees when it comes the gridiron in the Ancient Eight, as Harvard has been in this same situation multiple times against Penn in recent years.
 
2012
 
Last year, Penn clinched a share of the Ivy League title on its home turf, as it grinded out a 30-21 upset over the No. 16/15 Crimson at Franklin Field. Down 28-14 in the fourth quarter, senior quarterback Colton Chapple nearly led an improbable comeback with a touchdown pass to fellow senior Kyle Juszczyk, but fell short after a sack for a safety on the ensuing drive. 
 
2011
 
With the Ivy League title once again on the line, No. 14 Harvard returned the Ivy League Title to Cambridge, with a 37-20 win over Penn. The Crimson defense forced three turnovers, including an interception returned for a touchdown by junior linebacker Alexander Norman. 
 
2010
 
Looking to foil unbeaten No. 18 Penn’s chance to top the Ivy League, Harvard was unable to prevent the Quakers from celebrating a league title at Franklin Field. The Quakers held the Crimson scoreless for three quarters and dominated on special teams, leading to a 34-14 victory. 
 
2009
 Beneath the pouring rain at Harvard Stadium, the Ivy League title was once again up for grabs. The ran inundated the turf, causing seven combined turnovers and four fumbles, as Harvard found itself unable to convert multiple times in the red zone. Penn downed Harvard 17-7 to clinch a share of the Ivy League title, though Harvard still had an outside chance to join the Quakers atop the league.

After seeing their team fall to the laughably bad and previously winless Jacksonville Jaguars, it’s hard to be a Tennessee Titans fan right now. The silver lining, at least for Harvard sports followers, is that Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 will be under center for at least the next few weeks.
 
Late in the first half of Sunday’s game, starting quarterback Jake Locker went down with yet another injury, this time to his foot. Sources say that the injury will require surgery. 
 
With Locker headed to the room that bears his name, Fitzpatrick stepped up with his best performance of the season but also had a costly miscue.
 
The former Crimson standout completed 22-of-33 passing for 264 yards and two touchdowns in the air. He also rushed for a score to account for 21 of the 27 Titans points for the day.
 
Though he was only sacked once, it proved to be the deciding factor of the game. With the Titans down 22-20 late in the fourth but in position to make the game-winning field goal, Fitzpatrick was stripped of the ball by Jaguar cornerback Will Blackmon, who took the pigskin all the way to the opposite end zone to put Jacksonville up by two possessions.
 
By the time Fitzpatrick connected with tight end Delanie Walker to pull the Titans within two, there was only forty seconds left. Titans failed to recover the onside kick, and the Jaguars ran the clock to their first victory of the season.
 
The loss dropped Tennessee to 4-5 on the year, second in the AFC South and a game back of the sixth and final wild card spot in the AFC, which is currently held by the 5-4 New York Jets.
 Titans coach Mitch Munchak confirmed that Locker is lost for the season in a press conference late Monday afternoon. In the mean time, the quarterback job is the Harvard grad’s to lose.

For Juanky Perdomo, freshman year didn’t just involve a record-setting number of hours in Lamont, or a trophy for most Annenberg cookies eaten in one sitting. Instead, Perdomo decided to champion the sailing world by becoming the first Harvard sailor in six years to compete at the Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association Single-handed National Championship. 
 
At this national championship that took place in Providence, R.I. on November 8-10, Perdomo not only became the first to compete in more than half a decade, but also became the first person since 2005 to earn second place. Tacked on to this list of achievements is the fact that no other freshman has ever been able to compete so successfully at this level.
 
Perdomo won six races and finished within the top 10 in 18 heats, tallying a total of 74 points. While he was still unable to best Georgetown’s senior Greg Martinez, who earned 64 points, Perdomo earned the second place and received the George Griswold Trophy.
 
Perdomo has been leading the sailing team ever since the start of this season. At the Navy Fall Invite, he came just nine points away from Martinez again to finish in second, helping propel the team to a fourth place finish. At the New England Freshman Championship, he assisted the team to place third.
 The Crimson sailing team has certainly earned its fair share of trophies over the past few years, but Perdomo’s awards add impressive successes to the team’s overall performance.

Fighting back from a 2-0 and then a 3-1 deficit, the Harvard men’s hockey team found itself within striking distance for the last nine minutes of the game, looking to upset No. 5/6 Quinnipiac Friday night at TD Bank Sports Center in Hamden, Conn.
But the Crimson (2-4-1, 1-4-1 ECAC) could not find the equalizer, falling to the Bobcats, 3-2, and losing its fourth straight game overall and in ECAC play. With the win, Quinnipiac (10-1-1, 4-0-1 ECAC) remains undefeated in league play.
“We were happy with our efforts Friday night,” captain Dan Ford said. “We really played hard and battled; I would’ve liked to have a better result, but we weren’t too discouraged moving on to the next night. We felt we were in [the] game and a couple plays here or there and we could’ve ended up on top.”
The Bobcats jumped out to an early 2-0 lead, with freshman defenseman Brayden Sherbinin and senior forward Cory Hibbeler each netting a goal. Sherbinin’s goal came 6:30 into the game, assisted by Tim Clifton and Alex Barron; Hibbeler scored at 12:02 into the first, with help from Devon Toews and Barron.
Part of Quinnipiac’s success this year has been its ability to get ahead early on the scoreboard, and again this was the case in the Bobcats' tenth win of the season.
“It’s tough to fall behind in the first period,” Ford said. “We thought that the first five-to-seven minutes we were carrying the play, [with] a lot of time in their offensive zone putting…so it’s tough when we give up a chance early and they are able to score quickly.”
Harvard was able to cut the deficit in half in the second period, as the Crimson took advantage of a facemasking penalty and game misconduct from Quinnipiac senior Kellen Jones. Sophomore forward Kyle Criscuolo scored the lone goal of the period, at 12:39 with an assist from freshman forward Phil Zielonka in Harvard’s first of two power-play opportunities in the game.
The Crimson and the Bobcats exchanged goals in the third period, and Quinnipiac was able to hold off Harvard’s late rallies.
Jordan Samuels-Thomas put the Bobcats up 3-1 4:20 into the final frame. Sophomore forward Jimmy Vesey then made it 3-2 on a delayed penalty opportunity with 8:50 remaining in the game, with help from sophomore Brian Hart and freshman Luke Esposito.
“We did a good job sticking with our game plan and taking it shift by shift,” Ford said. “When you fall behind on the road like that it’s easy to stray from what you’re trying to do as a team, but we did a pretty good job of going through the process and battling back each shift. That’s what got us back in the game and put ourselves [in a position] to get a few chances at the end of the game to possibly tie it up.”
The Crimson could not put another puck past Bobcat goalie Michael Garteig, who had 31 saves on the night, 18 of which came in the third period—including one that was reviewed but ultimately ruled no goal.
“Towards the end of the game we were pressing,” Criscuolo said. “We had the puck in their end [and] got a lot of shots. Their goalie actually played really well.  I think we all felt that we were going to get a goal at the end [but] it just didn’t happen.”
Harvard goalie, senior Raphael Girard, countered with 30 saves of his own.
“He stood on his head again for us,” Criscuolo said. “Overall he’s been playing really well all year…as long as our goaltending keeps playing great we’ve been in almost every single game; we just need to start scoring more goals for those guys.”
This defeat also marks Harvard’s second straight one-goal loss as it enters into a stretch of play that includes seven road games over its next eight. The Crimson will look to build upon this close loss to a highly ranked team as the season progresses.
“I think everyone felt that we carried the play for most of the game,” Criscuolo said. “We played a lot in their end, we got a lot of shots in the first and third periods, so I think we have a positive feeling knowing they were the sixth ranked team in the nation. I think we felt we deserved better in that game, it stinks not getting a point but it’s a good step moving forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard football coach Tim Murphy thought his Crimson had put Penn away.
Up 38-0 midway through the third quarter, Murphy pulled several of his starters, thinking ahead to The Game next week.
The Quakers proceeded to tally 30 points in 15 minutes, turning what looked like a blowout into a one-possession game with 4:30 left.
Penn came close to coming all the way back after Harvard went three-and-out for a fifth straight time, but the Crimson defense stiffened up at the last possible moment after giving up four consecutive touchdowns.
The Quakers converted two fourth downs on their final drive, getting all the way to Harvard’s 20 with 30 seconds remaining, but its luck ran out on 4th and nine. A pass over the middle was tipped up in the air and fell harmlessly to the ground.
Junior quarterback Conner Hempel, who was pulled in the third quarter after a dominant first half, came out for one kneeldown to give the Crimson a 38-30 victory, keeping its Ivy title hopes alive.
“If we weren’t so banged up, we wouldn’t have pulled so many guys, but obviously we pulled them too soon. We lost momentum, and it obviously became a very precarious situation,” Murphy said. “I was really proud of us getting the big stop at the end.”
After throwing for 220 yards in the first half, Hempel started the second the same way, marching Harvard down the field. Sophomore Paul Stanton finished the 12-play, 76-yard drive with a two-yard touchdown run that put the Crimson (8-1, 6-1 Ivy) up, 38-0.
Murphy pulled Hempel, Stanton, and others at that point, and the Harvard offense subsequently stagnated.  It did not get another first down for the rest of the game.
Hempel and the starters returned with 8:24 left, but they couldn’t find their first-half form, failing to convert a 3rd-and-one and a 3rd-and-three on their final two drives.
Meanwhile, the Penn (4-5, 3-3 Ivy) offense came alive. The Quakers managed just 56 yards in the first half, but quarterback Ryan Becker found his groove as his team compiled 262 yards in a wild second half.
First, Penn ended Harvard’s seven-quarter shutout streak late in the third quarter. After Becker converted a fourth-and-five, freshman Adam Strouss replaced him and ran in from one yard out.
Penn got a short field on its next possession after a 33-yard punt, and took advantage with another one-yard touchdown run by Strouss.
The Quakers scored twice more, and converted two-point conversions each time. Becker was 9-for-11 on those two drives, and converted the first two-point try despite an illegal substitution penalty pushing the team back five yards.
“It was almost like we flipped a switch,” Penn coach Al Bagnoli said. “In the second half, we executed great and they didn’t execute great. It’s a funny game when these two teams play. Fortunately for us, these kids did not give up.”
By that point, memories of last year’s collapse at Princeton returned to Murphy’s mind. Harvard led that game by 24 in the fourth quarter, but the Tigers scored 29 straight to upset the then-undefeated Crimson.
“I’d be a liar if I said I wasn’t [thinking about that game],” Murphy said.
Just like last year, Murphy was faced with a fourth down late in the game. Once again, he opted to punt the ball away and trust his defense. Whereas Princeton drove the ball 90 yards to take the lead with 13 seconds remaining, Penn came up just short.
“We made it interesting,” Bagnoli said.  “We just couldn’t quite finish it.”
Harvard survived thanks to the cushion it gave itself in the first half, when it scored a total of 31 points, including 17 in just over three minutes.
After senior David Mothander’s 19-yard field goal gave the Crimson a 17-0 lead with 3:01 remaining in the opening half, Harvard’s defense held Penn to zero yards on three plays, and junior Norman Hayes blocked the ensuing punt to give the offense the ball at Penn’s 28.
It took the Crimson just four plays to punch it in from there, with Stanton finishing the drive on an eight-yard scamper.
On the first play of the Quakers’ next drive, captain Josh Boyd got his first interception of the season and the Harvard offense got the ball back with 31 seconds remaining. Junior Conner Hempel and co. needed just 13 of those ticks.
Hempel first found senior Ricky Zorn for a 37-yard gain to Penn’s three. Then, freshman Ryan Halvorson hauled in a touchdown pass on the next play to put Harvard up, 31-0, with time to spare.
“We showed what we are made of,” Murphy said.  “We got it done.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With its hopes of advancing in the NCAA tournament on the line, the Harvard women’s soccer team held on for as long as it could. But in the end, the squad could only bend for so long before it broke.
The Crimson (12-4-2, 7-0 Ivy) saw its season come to an end on Saturday as No. 25 Boston University (15-3-4, 8-1-0 Patriot) came away with a 1-0 victory at Nickerson Field. The Terriers’ win ended Harvard’s 14th NCAA Tournament appearance.
“It was a hard fought battle between both teams,” junior defender Erika Garcia said. “I would say they brought it and so did we. It’s unfortunate that we lost.”
In the 76th minute, BU freshman forward Erica Kosienski received a pass from senior Kylie Strom high in the box and managed to control it and push it past freshman goalkeeper Lizzie Durack before colliding with the first-year keeper. The Harvard defenders could only watch as the ball dribbled past the goal line and into the back left corner of the net.
The Crimson made a late rush after Kosienski’s goal to try to extend its postseason appearance. Within a minute, sophomore defender Alika Keene received a corner and headed it towards the net, but BU goalkeeper Andrea Green managed to tip it over the goal. On the ensuing corner kick, the Terriers cleared the ball away before Harvard could put a shot on goal in what would be one of its last opportunities to send the contest into extra time.
The Terriers controlled possession for most of the game, tallying 11 shots on net compared to Harvard’s four. The Crimson recorded eight fouls in the tilt, but the hard-nosed defense helped keep the Terriers off the board in the first half.
“As a team, we did really well defending them,” Garcia said. “Collectively, it was us defending everywhere on the field, from the forwards to [defenders] that held them off for so long.”
Even when there were defensive lapses, junior goalkeeper Cheta Emba was able to bail the team out. In the sixth minute, Terrier junior forward Taylor Krebs managed to break past the defense, only to have her shot stopped on Emba’s diving save. Later, BU senior forward Madison Clemens also broke past the defense but was unable to get off a shot before Emba came out and pounced on the squirming ball.
“Cheta played really well for us,” co-captain Peyton Johnson said. “She made a few big plays for us that helped preserve the tie.”
Playing on its half of the field for the majority of the game, Harvard spent many of its possessions trying to play through balls over the top of the defense. But it was to no avail, as Harvard registered only one shot on goal in each half. Freshman Margaret Purce was able to find an opening in the Terriers’ defense in the 34th minute and put a strike on net, but the shot went right to the goalkeeper Green for an easy save.
Despite the lack of shots from the Crimson, the squad was still able to create scoring chances. A through ball sent to freshman Joan Fleischmann was played just a hair too far in front of her, and she was unable to corral the ball before the goalkeeper gained possession.
There was no shortage of scoring chances for the Terriers. BU had six corners on the day, four of which came in the fifteen minutes leading up to Kosienski’s goal. The game-winning goal was the culmination of the Terriers’ aggressive offensive attack.
The Crimson had not lost a match in over two months. After falling to New Hampshire on Sept. 11th, Harvard rolled off a 14-game unbeaten streak that the team carried into Saturday.
“We started off with three losses,” Garcia said. “From there on, we said that we were not going to let that happen again.”
The loss marks the end of one of the Crimson’s most successful campaigns in recent memory. Even with the playoff loss, this year’s squad compiled the best record the program has seen in the 21st century. The team also won every game in conference play, a feat that had not been accomplished in decades.
“Right now [our successful season] hasn’t really hit me because this loss is fresh in my mind,” Garcia said. “But when we look back, we are going to realize how special this team was.”

We went around the Square and asked what people thought Harvard students do on an average Saturday night. What were the responses? Click the play button to find out.

As Benjamin Franklin famously (kind of) said, “at Harvard, nothing can be said to be certain, except lazy TFs and overeager students.” Whether because they’re struggling with an assignment or hoping to suck up to their grader, overeager students can regularly be found at TFs’ office hours. So for those lazy TFs out there, here are the top five ways to deter students from showing up when you’re just trying to get ahead on your dissertation and watch some Hulu.
 
1. Make awkwardly might-be-sexual jokes in section.Just sexual enough to make it uncomfortable, but not sexual enough to get fired.
 
2. Reference alternative resources for your students, including other TFs’ office hours, the professor, and tutors through the Bureau of Study Counsel.You may be required to lead a section and host office hours, but there’s no reason for you to do anything extra when this University offers so many alternative resources.
 
3. Act like there is an expectation that every student read every paper.Nothing stops students from attending office hours like the fear of being called out for a lack of reading. To intimidate your students even more, regularly and curtly cite obscure papers (including ones that aren't on the reading list) in response to questions in section.
 
4. Provide negative comments on an exam or paper but give a good grade.No student would dare to bring that assignment to your office hours lest you realize that his or her grade should have actually been lower.
And finally, the best way of ensuring that students will not attend:5. Hold office hours on Friday mornings.

Are we allowed to cross-register for courses at Brown? It’s too bad that Ec 10 students were stuck taking a midterm on Wednesday, because that day their professor N. Gregory Mankiw was over in Providence delivering a lecture to students there (he managed to fit that in when he’s only scheduled to lecture in his intro economics course about six times this semester).
 
If he hasn’t decided to join the Brown faculty full-time (whatever “full-time” is), Flyby came up with a list of other places where Mankiw could guest lecture.
 
 1. The Oval Office
 
Mankiw should feel quite at home here, having already served as an economic advisor to former President George W. Bush, as well as Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign. It sounds as though he now has some advice to offer President Obama: According to the Brown Daily Herald, he said Wednesday that he doubts that the U.S. “can substantially reduce health care costs in this economy without significantly reducing the quality of care.” Wait, never mind. Keep him away from the Oval Office.
 
2. China
 
At Brown, Mankiw also reportedly said that “we have to get China on board” to fight climate change. We recommend sending him there on a mission to convince the Chinese government to help us fight climate change. We’re unsure how his position against a lot of government intervention in markets will be received in China, but we imagine that he must be very persuasive since he somehow manages to get hundreds of eager freshmen to buy his textbook each fall. 
 
3. A gas station
 
As you’ll remember if you’ve taken Ec 10, Mankiw is a big supporter of increasing gasoline taxes. To start implementing this on the ground right away, we’d like to see Mankiw deliver a lecture on this to gas station customers while he attempts to charge them the extra money. 
 
4. Goldman Sachs
 
All joking aside, though, it’s clear that Mankiw’s true calling, perhaps the pinnacle of his career, would be to deliver a lecture at the Goldman Sachs headquarters. From his defense of the wealthiest one percent to his arguments against regulation, we’re sure he’d be received with a standing ovation. Plus, it’ll remind them all of their own days at Harvard and in Ec 10.
 
THEY SEE YOU WHEN YOU'RE TWEETING This week, the New York Times published an article based on this study which says that more admissions officers are checking out applicants’ digitals profiles. Scary, no? Others seemed to think so (or not), based on the number of response articles. The popularity of the article even prompted the original author to post a follow-up with some of the (occasionally hilarious) tweets she got in response to the thought-provoking topic. Maybe it’s time to un-follow Miley?
DEBATING AFFIRMATIVE ACTION Issues of race in college applications have once more taken the Federal stage in a debate over the controversial issue of affirmative action at Texas University. A white applicant who had been turned down, as she attests, in favor of other minority students, brought the suit against the university. The main focuses of the debate this past week were race-neutral alternatives and whether or not the university had reached a “critical mass” of minority students. The outcome of this case could have major ramifications for college admissions across the country.
