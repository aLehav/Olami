Martin McDonagh’s “The Pillowman” is a fairy tale—the kind of fairy tale in which Rumpelstiltskin rips himself in half instead of merely running away at the end. Though dark humor is on par for the course for the writer of “Seven Psychopaths” and “In Bruges,” this play, which runs at the Loeb Mainstage from April 4 to 12, may be McDonagh’s blackest work to date. With precise performances and minimalist flair, Lily R. Glimcher ’14’s production captures with equal success both the comic and the creepy aspects of the play. The result is a show that is simultaneously hard to watch and hard to tear oneself away from.
 “The Pillowman” takes place in a “totalitarian fucking dictatorship,” where Katurian (Benjamin J. Lorenz ’14), a writer and latter-day Josef K., finds himself under investigation after a series of child murders mirror with spooky exactitude the content of his twisted stories. When his mentally ill brother, Michal (Taylor A. Cressler ’14), implicates both of them in the killings, Katurian must find a way to save what is most important to him from destruction at the hands of police officers Tupolski (Adam J. Conner ’14, an inactive Crimson business editor) and Ariel (Dorothy C. Donelan ’14)—not himself, not his brother, but his 400 short stories.
 As the interrogation progresses, viewers are treated—to use the word liberally—to several of Katurian’s pieces of nightmare-fuel fiction. A child is crucified by sadistic foster parents; a little girl is force-fed apples studded with razor blades; a boy is repaid for his kindness to a stranger by having his toes cut off. In the hands of a less sure-footed production, these grim fairy tales might have been brought to life in a much more literal form, resulting in a stage awash with fake blood and an alienated audience. But Glimcher’s version takes its cues less from Quentin Tarantino than from Michael Haneke, whose film “Funny Games” notably shorthands a main character’s death with nothing more than a red splatter against a television screen. Katurian’s “The Tale of the Town on the River,” for example, is executed with crisp minimalism: a pair of men’s shoes, the swing of a knife, and, across the stage, two disembodied doll’s feet. Other stories are rendered on a stage flooded with light, reducing the figures to mere silhouettes. The effect of these shadowplays is to force viewers to imagine for themselves the horrors they are being narrated, coming up with images that must surely be infinitely more terrifying than anything a cash-strapped student production would have been able to act out. Rounding out the show’s collection of ghoulish tricks are masks and puppets (designed by Glimcher and Alona Bach ’16) that channel the creepy aesthetic of Czech stop-motion animator Jan Švankmajer.
 But these visual effects would have been for nothing if the cast had not been as strong as it was. Lorenz delivers a studied, subtle performance whose energy waxes and wanes along with Katurian’s spirit, which now flags in despair, now flares up in anger. Some of the play’s most affecting moments occur in exchanges between Lorenz and Cressler, whose fraternal bond is utterly convincing. Against a background of so much horror, the instances of tenderness between them—when Katurian touches Michal’s face, say, or lovingly cradles his brother’s head—serve as much-needed points of emotional relief for the viewers, the only instances of warmth in an otherwise chilling play.
 As two sadistic interrogators, Conner and Donelan are no less successful a pairing. Conner’s Tupolski is the smart-aleck to Ariel’s spitfire, more likely to use a well-placed barb than the electrodes his partner prefers. “Oh, I almost forgot to mention, I’m the good cop, she’s the bad cop,” he deadpans glibly after Ariel slams Katurian against a table. With the easy confidence of a seasoned officer, Conner balances out Lorenz’s panic and Donelan’s violence. The latter started out a tad shaky, with a quaver in her voice that undercut her viciousness. She recovered quickly, however, and later on successfully captured the slow crumble of Ariel’s snarling façade. For all that, however, Donelan is at her most compelling when she’s neither raging nor weeping, but rather briskly doing detective work, attempting coolly to unravel the tales that Lorenz spins for her and her character’s partner.
 Justifying his amoral approach to literature, Katurian asserts, “The first duty of a storyteller is to tell a story.” If that’s the case, then McDonagh’s “Pillowman” does its job, and the HRDC’s production of his play more than ensures that his twisted tale will not be forgotten, however much a viewer may like to do so.

“You know how sometimes you say a word you know is wrong, and you’re waiting to see if someone will correct you?” asks Neil Brederman (Jacob D. Rienstra ’17), the protagonist of the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of “In Other Words,” running in the Loeb Ex from April 4 to 12. In a play that deals with the complexity of expressing yourself, there is a tinge of truth in Neil’s confession that is impossible to ignore: the hardest aspect of communicating is not what you cannot say, but what you cannot say correctly. It is in moments like these that make the musical, written by Samuel C. Pottash ‘16 and Mike C. Ross ’16, thoughtful and expressive. Simultaneously ludicrous and contemplative, the show creates a story that speaks to a generation not used to communicating face-to-face through a combination of excellent acting and directing by Olivia M. Munk ’16.
 
The musical centers on Neil, who wants to win the love of the cute girl at the bookstore, Terri Vimes (Taylor L. Vandick ’16). He goes about it by holding a fake book club with his friends. As they talk about literature and unwittingly explore their own frailties, the characters must confront their problems and learn to grow as individuals while finding more meaning to their lives.
Munk employs the space inside the Loeb Ex masterfully. With set designer Katie A. Farineau ’16, Munk transforms the small stage into a dorm room and bookstore. The use of three levels—the bookshop in front of the mainstage that is wheeled out at various times, the a common room and a bedroom in the center, and a second bedroom on the mezzanine—allows for unique staging. At one instance point, Neil talks with Rhys Kent (Cole V. Edick ’17), his roommate Grover Frye’s (Eli B. Schleicher ’17) love interest, in his bedroom on the mezzanine. Schleicher expresses Grover’s curiosity by crawling and slinking up the steps to eavesdrop—an execution impossible if every set piece were on the same level.
 
In a musical that is in part about awkward social relations, character interactions must be precise to naturally portray unease; fortunately Munk’s blocking as well as the cast’s interpretation of their respective characters showcase the characters’ discomfort effectively. When Terri enters his room, she becomes wedged on the couch between Grover and Beth Boylston (Kathryn A. McCawley ’17) in a cramped position. This is further complemented by Vandick’s performance as she bunches her knees together and scrunches her shoulders.
In a musical that deals with quick emotional ups and downs, the cast adeptly handle the quick vacillations of emotions. Humorous one-liners such as author Chris LeSandrini’s (AJ Unitas Jr. ’16) quip “When did everybody hates Chris become a thing?” fluidly switch to moments of self-reflection within a second. Sometimes the actors embrace their cliche roles, be it the cynical English major or the flamboyant gay roommate who can’t let go of his inner child; as Neil hurriedly prepares for Terri’s visit, Rienstra depicts Neil’s intense anxiety and awkwardness by rolling on the couch and lying dramatically on the coffee table. It is an appropriately melodramatic performance that defines his character from the opening song. At other times, the actors are more subtle, like when Vandick licks her lips during an awkward exchange; the result is a heartfelt, candid look into these characters.
The scene-stealer of the production, however, is Edick. While his character, Rhys, lacks the development the others undergo, Edick adds spice to what could be a one-dimensional role. From the moment he first enters the stage, he carries himself with a slight british accent that never falters. His vivacious, confident air serves as a fitting contrast to the other actors’ more somber performances, highlighted during “Not To Say” as he takes winking selfies while Rienstra and Schleicher rant about their dilemmas.
 
The performances are not without flaws. While the acting is lively, the singing is decidedly less impressive. It oftentimes sounds more like talking to the music’s beat than anything else. But there are exceptions. Schleicher holds his notes well with gusto during “I Think I Peaked in High School” as he sings the title phrase and draws out the word ‘again’ at the very end. In moderation, the speak-singing style accentuates the actors’ performances. During the song “What the Fuck Are You Talking About?,” the talkative feel contributes well to the characters’ frustration and confusion as they shout and argue. Pottash accompanies the actors with his fantastic piano playing; despite playing the only instrument, Pottash drives every song forward, expressing every emotional nuance with crescendos and mimicking uncomfortable lags in the conversation by slowly dragging out the melody.
 Lighting by Julius G.B. Ross ’17 further enhances the production. As Beth flies into a rage in the number “Am I the Only Person Here?,” red light shrouds her, an immediate signal of Beth’s mounting anger. The light spotlights McCawley as she tangos with a limp Neil and sneers at Terri, accompanied by orchestration that is reminiscent of “Cell Block Tango” in “Chicago.” This scene is yet another example of the deft collaboration between the cast and crew. The nuances in the production’s technical elements allow a greater complexity when demonstrating the the characters’ emotions. As a result, any angsty and maudlin behavior feels less overdone and more relatable. Sometimes it might be difficult to find the right words, but HRDC’s “In Other Words” has no trouble finding the truth through comedy to create a fun, provocative production.

In the Harvard-Radcliffe Drama Club’s upcoming production of Jason Robert Brown’s “Songs for a New World,” a small and talented team has come together in order to create a heartfelt version of a distinctly unusual show. This genreless piece does not set out to tell a single story, but instead delivers a chain of vignettes that are conveyed through song and tied together through overarching themes.
 
“It’s certainly different. I think that it will end up feeling almost like a fashion show of musical theatre,” cast member Amy K. Sparrow ’15 says. “It sort of feels like a concert with a theme.”
 
The show offers an extremely varied array of settings and characters: the stories range from that of a captain on a Spanish ship in the 13th century to a young man from the Bronx who dreams of becoming a basketball star.
 
“You get to see 16 wild and sometimes crazy characters all thrown into these intense moments of flux…struggling with how to make a big, life-changing decision,”  director Susanna B. Wolk ’14 says. “There are some that are super relatable and some that are kind of fantastical and crazy, and I think that you get the whole spectrum of human experience.”
 
This will be Wolk’s fifth time directing a show here at Harvard. Alongside her is an extremely experienced team and a talented cast of nine singers and actors. “There’s such a good variety of voices, and just so many strong performers. It will be a really impressive show,” cast member Alex J. Raun ’17 says. “I’ve never been so excited about the music in a show.”
 
Indeed, Brown’s challenging yet beautiful score is one of the highlights of “Songs of a New World.” “I think that the music is absolutely beautiful, and there are so many moments where in the rehearsal process we’ll be in tears because of how moved we are watching one another perform,” cast member Kyra A. Atekwana ’14 says.
 The show will run from April 10 to 12 in the Adams Pool Theater.

History concentrators of a certain generation—we who took the former version of History 97—are intimately familiar with Parisian cat massacres, baby-eating dingoes, and the charivari. Charivari, which has sojourned from Greek to Latin and then to French, and loosely translates as “rough music,” began its life as a folk custom during the Middle Ages. A ritualized community event involving loud and discordant music, revelry, and role reversal between feudal classes, the charivari was the ancestor of protest.
 
Though it started as part of traditional wedding celebrations, the practice evolved into a tactic of censure, a mechanism to express communal disapproval toward violators of social norms, correcting behavior through public humiliation and shunning. Attempts by the Church to discourage charivari failed; the custom endured, crossed the sea, and became American.
 
Protest is not much different today than then: crowds gather, raise their voices, make noise, march with a sense of pageantry, and expose wrongdoing in the hopes that shame or boycotts (a type of shunning) might convince the powerful to change their ways. This method of seeking redress of grievances is deeply ingrained in American culture. And this spring charivari comes to our campus; there’s much to protest.
 
The association between charivari and protest registered with me this week when I saw a flyer taped to my door in Mather Tower—a notice of an upcoming demonstration this Friday, a notice posted by Responsible Investment at Harvard, a notice about SHAME (Stop Harvard’s Argentine Mismanagement and Exploitation). I normally don’t pay attention to such things, but this caught my eye, in part because of a recent column in the Crimson by Sandra Y.L. Korn ’14.
 
The story of the University’s investment in Argentina, specifically investments in forestry that threaten the wetlands of Iberá, broke last year. I was heartbroken to hear of it because, as a student in Harvard’s summer 2010 study abroad program in Argentina, I had the great privilege to travel to Iberá and see first-hand the world’s second largest wetlands. It’s a bitter pill to swallow: the same institution that funded my summer program—that let me experience Iberá—also allegedly profits in small part by degrading the same place.
 
The wetlands are a site of great beauty and of rich, but perilous biodiversity. The plants and trees that naturally grow in Iberá are home to many birds, as well as deer, capybaras and a variety of small caiman known as Yacarés; silt collects around the trees, forming delicate land masses in the marshes. The name “Iberá” comes from the Guaraní term for “bright water,” which is exactly what you see on a boat tour—an endless, eye-filling, panorama of water glittering with sunlight, a world of islands floating on a second sky.
 
Exploring Iberá was one of the most memorable times from my Argentine studies. Corrientes Province, in which Iberá is located, is as different from the melancholic, nostalgic city of Buenos Aires as can be imagined. Tropical, poor, with pockets of indigenous peoples, Corrientes is a place in need of investment. But not of the kind Harvard’s brought. Restoration of the wetlands has led to increased eco-tourism, an income source that won’t drain the land of its water.
 
Advocates for the Corrientes small scale famers have arrived at Harvard to speak about the forestry project’s effect on agriculture and water conservation. Theirs is a clear case—water levels are dropping: eventually, the wetlands as a whole will experience stress and the farmers will face tough choices about food and resource management that should be completely avoidable.
 
But this is only one issue for our university community to consider. Two other campaigns long-simmering, are near to boiling over. I mean, of course, reform of student mental health services and reform of campus sexual assault response. Both of these issues have come to the fore due to recent news—brave op-eds like “In Sight, Out of Mind” and “Dear Harvard, You Win”,” and the untimely passing of fellow students.
 
I don’t know what is planned, or being planned, in reaction to these events. As we all have, I’ve received emails from Dean Pfister and President Faust about the importance of community and the formation of task forces. But at this point it doesn’t feel like enough. I remember being so hopeful last semester that real changes were coming, but the groundswell has subsided.
 
As a student being treated at UHS for depression, as a student who has struggled with and been hospitalized for suicidal thoughts, I regret not having done more in the past. I feel terribly guilty for remaining silent rather than adding my voice to the raucous charivari it will take to improve students’ encounters with university staff and administrators. For this reason, I’m counting on a loud springtime, a springtime of birdsong, rough music, and effective protests.

Nearly thirty years ago, as protests and tensions over Apartheid South Africa gripped the international community, the Institute of Politics hosted activist and archbishop Desmond Tutu. Tutu turned his focus to Harvard’s investments in South African companies. He called for the university to make decisions that would place it on the right side of history, saying, “When we get to the other side of this liberation game, we would like to be able to say, ‘You know something, Harvard University was with us.’”
 
Today, another debate over divestment has taken hold, except this time it concerns the small Middle Eastern nation that has managed to capture the global spotlight time and time again: Israel. The troublesome situation in the West Bank and Gaza has garnered attention from people and nations around the world. Many draw similarities to South Africa, calling for the same kinds of divestments and invoking the same desires to be vindicated in the years to come. In particular, passion has emerged on American college campuses. This March, the Palestinian Solidarity Committee at Harvard sponsored an “Israeli Apartheid Week,” while student governments at other schools have proposed measures to divest from Israel.
 
Despite its recent momentum, Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions—the moniker for the Israel divestment movement—remains an abhorrent tactic. Rather than opening discussion, it rejects dialogue. Rather than searching for a compromise of peace, it seeks destruction. And rather than encouraging understanding, it provides for divisiveness. The situation in Israel is not analogous to the one that existed in South Africa—attempts to mimic the methods of anti-Apartheid activists only push us further away from a peaceful solution.
 
By its nature, BDS impedes meaningful dialogue about the issues at hand. Opinions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are not binary; those on either side of the debate hold a wide range of beliefs. BDS simultaneously groups all supporters of Israel together and rejects the fundamental legitimacy of their convictions.
 
BDS further places the onus of solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict entirely on Israel’s shoulders. Palestinians must bear some of the responsibility as well in order to facilitate any serious attempt at compromise. In South Africa, a minority of whites denied the rights and dignity of the black majority and was unwilling to alter national policies until the pressure of the 1980s—end of story. The tale of Israelis and Palestinians is far more complex and nuanced. Since 1947, there have been numerous instances of Israeli attempts at peace and subsequent rejections by Palestinians. During the War of Independence, there was not only a displacement of Arabs from what would become Israel, but also an exodus of Jews from countries throughout the Middle East. None of this is to say that the current Israeli-Palestinian problems should be neglected, but rather that no one side ought to carry the duty for fixing them. On a campus like ours, with such a strong tradition of mutual expression and open-ended debate, BDS represents the antithesis of a proper problem-solving mechanism.
 
Another, perhaps more important, reason for the objectionableness of BDS is the dissonance between its stated goals and the effect it would truly have. According to the movement’s official website, BDS seeks boycotts until Israel “end[s] its occupation and colonization” of the disputed territories, grants “full equality” to Arab-Palestinians in Israel, and ensures “the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and properties.” However, as Norman Finkelstein, American author and notably harsh critic of Israel, explains, the combination of a right of return for refugees (and their descendants) to Israel—rather than a newly created Palestinian state—and the granting of permitting of full citizenship to all such individuals would mean the destruction of Israel as a Jewish state.
 
Arabs in Israel proper ought to have equal citizenship and voting rights—as they do currently—but an influx of millions of new possible citizens would extinguish Israel’s inherent existence as Jewish, a status that is upheld both by values and by demography. There is surely a continuing debate over what it means for a state to be Jewish and what the implications of such an identity are in a democracy. This discussion ought to continue, but BDS alleges to focus on ensuring rights for Palestinians, not challenging Jewish self-determination. The movement claims itself agnostic on state politics so long as individual liberties are not violated. Boycotts of South Africa had the objective and the effect of dismantling the Apartheid regime and establishing a new political system. In contrast, BDS does not, at least on the surface, advocate for the end of Israel as a Jewish state, even though that is exactly the impact it would have.
 
 There is no question that real and lasting change must come to the Israel-Palestinian conflict. The present situation is unsustainable, and a two-state solution is in the interest of all parties. The difficulty comes in getting there, a feat that can only be accomplished through dialogue and interaction. BDS discourages and even disallows both. Just days before Apartheid Week began at Harvard, a group called Heartbeat held an interfaith performance at the Law School with the goal of bringing together Israelis and Palestinians through music. We need movements that allow the many sides of the conflict to come together rather than ones that intentionally pull them apart, neglect communication, and strive towards questionable ends. Opposing BDS is not synonymous with opposing the rights of Palestinians or a two-state solution. It is an acknowledgement of a move forward in the peace process.

Several rural states are seeking to shake up the way that the government allocates research money. Traditionally, states like Massachusetts, California, and New York—all urban and coastal—have won outsized shares of federal research funding, disproportionate to their percentages of the national population. A number of senators from rural states, however, are aiming to change that trend. To that end, they seek to increase the amount of money—from $273 million to $310 million—allocated for National Institutes of Health’s Institutional Development Award, which funds researchers in 23 states, mostly rural, that have traditionally struggled to win NIH grants.
 
Massachusetts comprises only two percent of the national population, but researchers in the Bay State received more than $1.77 billion of the NIH funding in 2013—more than eight percent of the institute’s awards. Massachusetts is the frequent recipient of NIH awards because of the presence of world-class medical institutions in Boston. However, proponents of the change argue for what they consider a more egalitarian distribution of NIH funding—they believe that state colleges and universities in the rural US also deserve funding for research, even if they lack the facilities or experience of more frequently recognized labs.
 
The allocation of federal funding, however, should be based primarily on merit, not on a well-intentioned but misguided push for egalitarianism. Though the support of research outside of traditional areas is a laudable goal, the inherent purpose of NIH funding is to inspire scientific breakthroughs. While it is undoubtedly true that research labs in rural areas have the potential to be centers of innovation, established centers such as Massachusetts General Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute are still more likely to produce major discoveries. Institutions like MGH have a long and storied tradition of scientific innovation; research centers in rural states lack the same proven track record.
 
This is not to say that the current system is perfect. Many supporters of scientific research have long argued—and continue to argue—for an increase in the total funds awarded by the NIH; such an increase would allow for an expansion of the Institutional Development Award program without negatively impacting research in research powerhouses in Massachusetts and other such states. Furthermore, criticisms of favoritism have long dogged the NIH, especially given the consistent flow of money to certain states.
 
While the distribution of NIH funding may not be a perfect system, it is nevertheless a meritocracy—funds are awarded to research labs based solely on the quality of their proposals. It would be ill-advised to alter the system simply for the sake of ensuring the presence of research labs in every state—instead, the NIH should continue awarding research funds with the primary aim of fostering innovation and advancement.

I’ll admit it. Until the Harvard College Events Board announced that Janelle Monáe would headline Yardfest, I had never heard of her. But I wasn’t the only one—the most liked comment on the Facebook announcement asked the question many of us wanted answered. ‘Who is she?’


While Boston University and MIT announced Robin Thicke and Capital Cities would perform for their respective concerts, my fingers were crossed for Daft Punk or Passion Pit to perform at Harvard. After all, previous Yardfests featured celebrity artists like Kid Cudi, Sara Bareilles, and Wu-Tang Clan. So I—and many others—were caught off guard by the announcement that a solo artist you may vaguely recall as the backup vocals from “We Are Young” would take the stage in Tercentenary Theater this April. But now I’m feverish in anticipation of what will be an incredible show. 
What many eager and naive Harvard students, myself included, experienced as they confusedly read the CEB announcement resembled Kübler-Ross’s five stages of grief. But after these five stages came the five stages of Monáe. Understanding succeeded uneasiness. 
The first stage was denial. ‘Janelle who? I must be missing something here. Is this a Satire V stunt? Or a production from the semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine?’ But after a moment of disbelief, I swallowed the truth.  
A solo artist whom I had never heard of was going to perform at Yardfest. The second stage, irritation, had kicked in. ‘Not Macklemore, who rocked Columbia’s Bacchanal? Not Kendrick Lamar, who rapped for Cornell and Brown? And what about Penn? They get David Guetta?!’ 
Then came bargaining. ‘If only our spring concert budget weren’t the lowest of the Ivies. If only I had voiced my opinion to the CEB.’ Although I didn’t make deals with a higher power, save Yeezus, I thought that Harvard had been cheated of a brag-worthy headliner.
‘Who needs to go to Yardfest at all? I don’t. It’s on a Sunday anyway. The day of rest.’ Sadness, the longest of the stages, lasted until new information slowly revealed that Janelle Monáe is exactly the artist Harvard needs.
Amidst recent rumblings concerning identity and belonging at Harvard, there may be no better candidate for a Yardfest headliner than Ms. Monáe. As “I, Too, Am Harvard” asks us to consider the place of Harvard’s students of color, the choice of Monáe affirms that all people, regardless of color or gender, belong here.  
Janelle Monáe brings with her a repertoire that all Harvard College students can enjoy as a unified community, unlike the music of artists invited to Yardfest previously. According to The Tech, the Boston City Council acknowledged Monáe’s “tireless efforts to inspire confidence, self-worth and equality in women all over the world, and her courage in speaking against the marginalization of historically oppressed groups” by proclaiming October 16, 2013 as “Janelle Monáe Day.”
Monáe has exercised her commitment to gender equality, whether it means performing fully dressed, unlike many other female artists she criticizes, or partnering with Cover Girl for a “Girls Can” campaign. Beyond feminism, Monáe’s lyrics speak to all those who were ever “ostracized and marginalized,” demonstrating a greater commitment to equality. As far as Monáe’s message, it doesn’t get much clearer—celebrate everybody.
That’s what Yardfest is all about, isn’t it? Coming together as one huge Harvard community, celebrating everybody? To think that if we had invited a chart-topper like Kendrick—if we had done it my way—we would be stuck with an event that once again marginalizes a portion of our community. That’s why I’ll be welcoming Janelle Monáe’s performance ungrudgingly. That’s why I’m thankful the CEB went for the lesser-known, more fitting artist.
Why I hadn’t heard of Janelle Monáe, I don’t know. But who Janelle Monáe is, I know now. She’s a star. She’s the Electric Lady.

Pinocchio’s Pizza & Subs is a classic Harvard Square staple. When customers enter—whether they are visiting families at two in the afternoon or intoxicated students at two in the morning—their senses are immediately overwhelmed by bright colors and the enticing aroma of pizza baking in the oven. Most visitors don’t really notice what’s on the walls until after they’ve had the chance to order, but once they do, they can’t help but be intrigued.
A mishmash of photographs cover all of the walls save one, which instead features a seemingly arbitrary mural of a whale and a mermaid consuming pizza. Some photos are black and white, and some are in color. Some have one person and some have many; some have none at all.  I am sure of one thing, though: they all must mean something.
The first to catch my eye is a photograph of a young Mark Zuckerberg eagerly digging into his slice of Noch’s pizza. A caption below details something called “Facebook Fridays,” which appear to be tech talks held every Friday afternoon, during which students get together in the spirit of upholding Mark Zuckerberg’s legacy and presence at Pinocchio’s to discuss current events in the world of computers. Now this is something exciting. Who started it? I wonder. What time is it held? Can I come? I catch one of the employees eyeing me as I read the poster, and I turn to ask him a few of my overflowing questions. Before I can get out any words, however, the gray-haired, jovial man looks at me with kindness and something close to pity in his eyes and regretfully tells me, “It doesn’t exist anymore.”
Oh. Well can he tell me anything about it? It was started by a student about five years ago now, went on for a few months, and then died out; he doesn’t know anything else. Not to be discouraged, I move on to my next query: one of the black and white photos, depicting a group of ten or so men standing outside Noch’s. Could this be the photo from when it was founded over 30 years ago?
He doesn’t know. And none of the other employees do either. Ok, can any of them tell me anything about any of the photos on the walls? Nope. Still convinced there is a story to be had, I ask if anyone else affiliated with the restaurant would know any interesting stories, and am told to come back tomorrow to talk to someone named Jerry. Ralph, the very genial employee that I have been talking to, wishes me good luck and a great rest of my day as I walk out the door.
The next day I return, full of hope and sure that I will leave the restaurant with my head chock-full of crazy stories. I enter, walk right up to the spotless counter, and ask to speak to Jerry.  At first, all I get is a host of confused and skeptical looks from no less than three members of the staff, who are no doubt convinced I have either come to register a complaint or am simply crazy. Is there a Jerry who works here? No? Are you sure? Somehow I manage to get across that I am not there with hostile intent, and Jerry comes out of the back to talk to me.
Unfortunately, he also claims to know literally nothing about the photographs. Not quite sure I believe him, I push a little harder and ask if he has been around for any of them. He flashes me a friendly smile and replies sure, he’s been around for 21 years. He remembers taking the photo of our good friend Mark I had asked about the day before, and recalls taking one with a Patriots football player he points out to me. So you just take photos with famous people when they come in? Yes, apparently. What about the ones on the wall with no famous people? The ones of just the staff or of local sports teams? No clue, he tells me. Most of the photos on the wall were there when he started 21 years ago.
Disappointed but not wholly unsatisfied, I take advantage of his affable demeanor to take one last stab at a fun story before I leave: does he know anyone else who might know anything more about the photographs? He suggests I talk to Ralph.

Advising Fortnight, now winding its way to a close, is that brief and wondrous period when concentrations vie for the attention of College students, before reverting to a holding pattern of vague disinterest. If only, if only these concentrations would learn to give up on bribing freshmen with brownie bites and just give the people what they want: a stiff drink. Since said freshmen cannot legally enjoy the pleasures of alcohol-fueled escape, FM is here to suggest several timely cocktails for particularly empathetic upperclassmen.
Economics: The Trickle Down
Add a splash of single-malt Scotch (preferably Glenfiddich 18 or similar) to a pitcher filled with ice. Watch and wait as the ice melts, diluting the Scotch until it can pass for water from the Charles.
Visual and Environmental Studies: The Vicinity of Culture
Place can of PBR in direct sunlight. Wait till warm. Carry it to the Mac Quad. With a stony face, pour over body. Crush can beneath heel and walk away.
History and Literature: The Poet Cemetery
Ask the local vintner to recommend a drink to match the literary luminary you’re feeling most at the moment. If it’s Charles Baudelaire, try something French and full-bodied, with notes of rotting fruit; if it’s Roberto Bolaño, try mezcal, tequila’s lesser-known cousin that’ll drop you breathless and half-naked along the road to Tijuana.
Slavic Languages and Literatures: The Little Water
One shot vodka, neat. Toast, rinse, repeat.
Neurobiology: The Synaptic Gap
Pause briefly from memorizing flashcards to pour Rubinoff into orange juice salvaged from the dining hall. Drink a little too much. Ride a party bus into Boston. Find your way to a beer-soaked room in the Quad. Forget it all—until the panic of morning comes, that is.
Latin American Studies: The Abyss
Maybe you should’ve gone to Yale—at least they have La Casa Cultural.

In the days leading up to Housing Day, the average House listserv will be bombarded with emails. There will be an interminable debate over the color of the housing day shirt. There will be emails demanding you wake up early for housing day. Later, there will be emails demanding you come to Annenberg to scream at the freshmen. And just when you think it’s over, when everyone seems ready for spring break, when you select the last email exhorting you to “welcome the new freshmen at the open house!” and mark it as spam, you realize it’s not. Because “doofus@college.harvard.edu” has just sent his own email over the list, fundamentally misunderstanding the subscription notification email. It’s a classic mistake, but it’s also a prime example of why freshmen should stay off House listservs.
Someone—probably an overeager freshman—will correct doofus@college’s mistake. Five minutes later, “didntgetthememo@college.harvard.edu” will send out his own email. Even worse, “overcommitted@college.harvard.edu” will soon be sending out reminders about the Trivial Pursuit Club meeting in Lev common room. Please. I don’t want to hear about it. Even if you are serving free pizza. It’ll probably be gone by the time I get there. Or it’ll be from The Just Crust.
Freshmen, be warned—House listservs will soon become the bane of your existence. You thought the first two weeks of freshmen year were bad, when ambitious@college.harvard.edu started campaigning for the UC over the Weld list? Just wait until people start asking for costume accessories or easy SPU classes. Don’t let yourself be the person you’ll hate in a year. You’re better than that.

For the past few years, professor Sean D. Kelly, chair of Harvard’s Philosophy Department, has been searching for a copy of Blaise Pascal’s death mask that just might be lost in Harvard’s collection. After little success, he recently offered an automatic A to any student in his “Existentialism in Literature and Film” class who can find the mask.
When French mathematician and Christian philosopher Blaise Pascal passed away in 1662 at the age of 39, a death mask was quickly made. “Within hours of his dying people came in and covered his face with plaster,” explains Professor Kelly. “They set an impression and made copies of it.”
Kelly first encountered this mystery while reading the letters of William James, whose works draw heavily on Pascal’s oeuvre. According to Kelly, James wrote a letter to his friend and fellow philosopher Émile Boutroux, “asking Boutroux—literally a few months before James dies—to send him this copy of the death mask of Pascal that he had purchased while in France.”
“And so, presumably, Boutroux did,” Kelly goes on, “because I then discovered that in the minutes of the Harvard University Corporation from March 1911 it’s announced that a gift was reported from the estate of William James—a death mask of Blaise Pascal—to the library of Philosophy in Emerson Hall.”
Things were coming together. Kelly went to the library and eagerly asked for the mask, but was told it couldn’t be found. He went to the Houghton Library—where an exhibition of James’s works had been held in 2010 (the centenary of his death)—and spoke to an archivist, but got a similar response.
He says he was told there was no record of the mask. “And so it seemed a mystery, a puzzle, and I wanted this death mask!” Kelly exclaims. “I wanted to take it before my class and say ‘This is the guy that we’re studying! And this mask has a relationship to our University!’”
Only slightly disillusioned, Kelly returned to the Robbins Library in Emerson Hall and spoke to its librarian, Eric Johnson-Debaufre. “He did some more searching, and he discovered that our records show that it was in the collection of our library until the 1980s or so,” Kelly says. “And then, at a certain point, it shows up as ‘missing from the collection.’”
Johnson-DeBaufre provides a slightly different timeline: “Actually, it was in our possession until 1915, at which point it was taken over by the Fogg [Museum] even though it was still ours, and then their records say that it’s recorded as missing after 1991.”
Regardless of the precise date, the mask had mysteriously disappeared. Bemused, Kelly ran through a list of missing objects provided by Johnson-DeBaufre, and noticed something strange. “I had just seen one of [the items] in our department office,” he laughs. “For 35 years it’s been listed as missing, but I happen to know that it was sitting on top of the filing cabinet—it’s just been there. I mean, nobody knew what to do with it.”
At this point the search took a decidedly mundane turn. Kelly began to speculate: “I thought, well, maybe the death mask is somewhere like that too, it’s in somebody’s filing cabinet—who knows? There have been renovations to the building, so maybe its behind some paneling, or—I don’t know.”
In his continued search for the mask, Kelly has only unearthed an extension of this nebulous history. Faced with a myriad of obstacles, and unsure of how to proceed, Kelly made the aforementioned offer to any student who can find the mask. But is this offer just a joke, considering the near impossibility of the task?
“Oh gosh, no!” Kelly laughs. “I mean, I think it’s hard, but I would love for it to happen.” He continues: “I certainly don’t know that it can’t happen—I still look once in a while, though I looked pretty hard and I couldn’t find it.”

I had high hopes (pun intended) for the History of Science 140v: “The Historical and Cultural Lives of Drugs in the U.S.” lecture I was sitting in on. Would we discuss the pros and cons of doing various drugs? Would we learn that Ben Franklin secretly had a coke problem? Would there be free weed? The possibilities were endless.
10:46 a.m. I chug a large, light roast coffee before the lecture to get some semblance of a buzz (did you know that light roast actually has more caffeine than dark roast?).
11:05 a.m. I walk into Geological Lecture Hall and am crestfallen to learn that today’s lecture won’t even mention, say, how to cook meth, but will instead focus entirely on the pharmaceutical industry and U.S. drug policy. Actual social problems? This isn’t what I signed up for.
11:07 a.m. The instructor, Nathan Greenslit, begins to speak in a lucid, totally non-intoxicated voice about the pharmaceutical industry’s influence on doctors since 1950. My spirits drop even lower. This isn’t flashy or sexy; in fact, it sounds suspiciously like a history class—Greenslit even drops an obligatory “heteronormative” about five minutes in. I begin to bunker down for an hour of what is sure to be a boring, thoroughly informative and educational lecture.
11:22 a.m. I snap out of my incipient coma when Greenslit brings in the expert opinion of comedian and noted drug policy scholar Chris Rock. A clip begins playing on the screen at the front of the lecture hall: “One thing I don’t like about America is we got real bad drug policy...the government always says drugs are illegal because they’re bad for you and we’re trying to protect society, but the government don’t give a FUCK about your safety! They sell guns at WALMART! They don’t give a FUCK about YOU! Shit.”
Now we’re talking.
“…The government, they don’t want you to use YOUR drugs, they want you to use THEIR drugs. So every night on TV, you see a weird-ass drug commercial trying to get you hooked on some LEGAL SHIT…the reason coke and weed are illegal in America, is because the best coke and weed ain’t made in America!”
Greenslit comments on Rock’s thesis: “So, in the social study of science there’s actually a technical term to describe what Chris Rock is talking about…” Well, I kind of zone out here.
When I tune back in, Greenslit is discussing the misleading rhetoric and questionable science that drug companies use to sell medication, as well as the philosophical distinction between drugs that “enhance” health and those that “restore” health—all of which must be very interesting, since almost half the students seem to be paying attention instead of browsing Facebook.
11:55 a.m. Finally Greenslit gives me some of the real-world knowledge I’ve come for: “…ecstasy, which is still illegal, but which can be obtained…you know…at parties, wherever.” I’ll be going to some parties this weekend to verify this information.
Stay tuned for my follow-up article “Obtaining Ecstasy, You Know, At Parties, Wherever” next week.

On Monday, April 21 more than 36,000 people will run the Boston Marathon. A year after the bombings at the 2013 Marathon, enthusiasm for the race is higher than ever.
Several members of the Harvard College Marathon Challenge plan to run and fundraise in support of PBHA.
Craig F. Rodgers, who founded HCMC, runs its listserv, and admits that no one at Harvard is going to win the race. But for him, the most important part of the day is enjoying the non-competitive aspects, like interacting with spectators, high-fiving kids, listening to the music, and taking in the atmosphere.
“For me, the thing I enjoy most about Boston is the unique experience of having that many other runners and spectators around.” Rodgers says. “The running 26 miles is secondary, because you can do it alone any day of the week. It’s much more about community and people than it is about the race.”
Sophie E. Heller ’14, an inactive Crimson editor, is of a similar opinion. For her, it’s not about the time as much as it is about being able to finish the race. Heller began running to relieve personal stress during her sophomore year, and then decided to try to run the Marathon.
“The most exciting thing is the fact I’m doing it,” Heller says. “It’s such a shocking transformation from thinking I’d never do a 5k in my wildest dreams to running a marathon.”
Heller is a member of the HCMC, and although she enjoys running alone to clear her head, she also appreciates the support and informal community offered by the HCMC.
According to Rodgers, people post to the HCMC list to crowdsource opinions from and to coordinate runs with the other members. There’s a real sense of community, and of the value of running together.
“The last three or four miles. That’s what I’m most excited for,” says Alex C. Boota ’14, also an HCMC member. “When I finally get to see downtown Boston and the whole city out there cheering.”
This will be Boota’s first full-length marathon, and like many members on the HCMC listserv, he doesn’t have previous marathon experience. Boota starting running to keep in shape during his freshman year at Harvard, and after watching the Boston Marathon on TV, he made running a marathon his personal goal. But this year is different.
“Now I’m not necessarily running for myself,” Boota says. “I’m running for survivors, the people who experienced the events of last year, the city in general, and the idea that we have a responsibility to run.”
Many of the runners acknowledge that there will be changes to the Marathon this year, including a noticeable increase in security. One of the big crackdowns will be on “running bandit,” or running the Marathon without having registered. While he admits the decision is understandable, Boota is still disappointed.
“It takes away from the community feel of it a little,” Boota says. “I was looking forward to friends running the last five or six miles with me. But I guess it’s more of a safety issue now.”
Heller, too, expects to feel the effects of increased security, including no longer being allowed to check a bag at the start of the race. “I’m having my mom send me old clothes to wear while I’m waiting to start,” Heller says. “That way I can just throw them out once the marathon starts without having to worry about them.”
Until the events last year, Kate D. D’Orazio ’15 was going to wait until she graduated to run the Marathon. But D’Orazio is from the Boston area, and was deeply affected by last year’s events, so she committed to running this year.
“I decided to run because I’m proud of Boston and proud of the resilience,” D’Orazio says. “There’s no better way to show that than running and raising money, to make something good out of what happened last year.”
Boota, too, realizes that this Marathon in particular will be a unique mix of memory and celebration.
“It’s different because the Marathon is usually a very personal goal,” Boota says. “Teamwork always helps, but this year is unique in that all of us are running for something other than ourselves.”

In a small office on the third floor of the Barker Center, students and a few professors congregate to ponder Christianity, Islam, Taosim, and every religion and spiritual practice in between. This is the headquarters for undergraduates studying religion at Harvard, where the approach is comparative and the range of interests is vast.
What does it mean to study religion today? It is not a discipline, exactly, but a conviction that religion is an important subject to examine. Scholars and students in the comparative study of religion concentration agree on that much; they debate and discuss nearly everything else.
To keep this interdisciplinary approach at its core, the study of religion at Harvard is structured as a committee instead of a department. Scholars affiliated with the concentration come from more than a dozen different departments, including East Asian Languages and Civilizations, Classics, History of Art and Architecture, and the Divinity School.
One of those scholars is Professor of Indo-Muslim and Islamic Religion and Cultures Ali S. Asani ’77, who also has appointments in Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, African and African American Languages, and about eight other areas. Before he became a professor, he was one of the first undergraduates to study comparative religion at Harvard. The early requirements were exacting. “We all struggled,” Asani says.
His junior year Asani shopped a class that met in a strange room, which turned out to be the office of a professor. He was the first to arrive. Ten minutes later, he was still the only student there. “The professor closed her eyes and started to talk about Islamic literature....Exactly on the hour, she stopped. ‘Any questions? Okay, good. I’ll see you next week.’” And that’s how Asani met his mentor and adviser Annemarie Schimmel, a world-renowned scholar on Islamic literature.
Those sort of arrangements characterized the early years of the concentration as it sought approval from the skeptical Harvard faculty. William A. Graham, who is still a professor at the Divinity School, came here in 1973 with the task of establishing a concentration in religion. Graham says some of the senior faculty members at the time viewed it as “the camel’s nose under the tent”—an attempt to introduce religious beliefs into the secular university. That was a fundamental misunderstanding, Graham says, and over time, “people have recognized...that religion is an object of humanistic study like literature or classics.”
Undergraduates today still encounter some confusion about what it means to study religion. Many of the students I spoke to described it as the priest/nun question. “So when are you getting ordained?” relatives will ask. Like any concentration, the reasons for their interest and their post-graduate plans vary tremendously. Alumni include bankers, journalists, and actress Rashida L. Jones ’97.
Personal beliefs sometimes prompt an interest in learning more about religion, but students often focus on a different tradition than their own. Sarah E. Wiant ’16, for example, has a Greek Orthodox mother, a Methodist father, and went to Episcopalian church growing up; she studies East Asian religion.
The students do seem to share one belief—that the concentration is excellent. I interviewed about a third of the 22 concentrators and every one of them used words like “amazing”, “best”, and “love.” They raved about professors, trumpeted the interdisciplinary flexibility, and preached about the importance of studying religion. From what I’ve seen, it might be one of the happiest groups on campus.
Director of Undergraduate Studies Courtney Lamberth has a lot do with that, students say. In the havoc of Freshmen Advising Fortnight, Sara K. Rosenburg ’16 wandered over to the comparative religion table. She talked to Lamberth, and that “refreshing” conversation led her to become a concentrator. Rosenburg and the five other sophomores are currently in a tutorial with Lamberth. They make tea together before class and have a group text to share quotes from the readings, which they insisted Lamberth join. Lamberth emanates warmth, conveying a deep, almost parental support for her students. “The classroom is an incredible place,” she tells me, and her students agree.
A little under 40 years ago, a young Asani stood not too far from Lamberth’s office. The Barker Center was the Freshmen Union back then, with a big dining hall on the first floor. On the second floor, you could play billiards. The third floor was “pretty derelict,” but there, in a back corner, was the office for the comparative study of religion. It moved around, and Asani changed departments, but when the office came back to Barker, he ended up in it.
In that office, students and scholars continue asking important questions about religion, about how understanding beliefs can help us understand history, art, literature, and the challenges of our current world. Asani put it this way: “if people cannot understand and engage with difference...it undermines the whole project of democracy.”

I’d always wanted an older sibling, preferably a brother: someone who’d probably beat me up but also teach me how to win my own fights, who’d fill me in on older kid secrets so I’d always be ahead of the game. Instead I got Odile, my clone only two years younger, who would be louder and funnier and perpetually misidentified as the older one. There are some photos of me smiling over her crib when she arrived home from the hospital, so I must have been happy about the prospect of sharing attention and toys. But she loves reminding others of how frequently I used to drop blocks on her head. (As if she can even remember that, I say. And she turned out fine—a few glitches here and there, but overall quite good.)
Odile and I got closer when I drove all of 20 minutes down the street for college. She happily took over my room, and I “accidentally” took some of her clothing, which she still thinks she lost. This short distance was perfect for our relationship: close enough to see each other when we wanted, like at J.P. Licks where a college friend of mine mistook her for me, but far enough to ordinarily avoid these mishaps. No more forced sharing; no more stray blocks. I didn’t look back.
I assumed I didn’t have to—I wasn’t really going anywhere. By necessity, I’ve always been comfortable with distance: My family lives scattered across continents, and I get restless too quickly in one place. The idea of really leaving home would have seemed more weighty, of course, and might have made me turn back, briefly, before carrying my last box out the door in late August, calling over my shoulder that I’d see Odile soon.
It’s something that my grandmother always said, as my family rolled our suitcases out of her apartment at the end of our summer visits to Turkey. “Look back,” she would say. “It means you’ll come back.” It felt like abandonment as she stood frozen at the top of the staircase, waving while we circled down the old flights and out into the Istanbul street, to be swept across the ocean and back home. Even from below, we knew to listen to her calling still from the open window, when we would all look back once more.
I never liked thinking about the possibility that returning each summer might one day not be an option, that it had to be ensured. Looking back when I traveled became a habit of mine. No matter where or how I leave—a train station, an airport, a bus stop—I look back as the ground glides away. Most of the time looking back doesn’t actually provide a view of what I’m leaving, only rows of seats or unfamiliar passengers. But that doesn’t matter.
The idea is not that I’ll come back, I think, but rather that there’s a place known and worth coming back to—something that stays the same, stable and stationary. That my grandmother’s apartment will always have its glass doors propped open, that the rooms they lead to will always have her and us in them.
Those doors were always slamming shut suddenly in the wind, I remember. These things change when you’re not around, whether you look back or not.
Suddenly, for instance, you have a brother who’s nearly seven years old, who’s growing up without you always around. Deniz reminds me of this as soon as I arrive at Newark airport this spring break: “You forgot my birthday!” he insists. I tell him that of course I know it’s next month, that it hasn’t happened yet, but he remains concerned that I haven’t even mentioned it.
When I was 15, I was unsure of exactly how to think about my new brother. I thought back to the expectation of sibling wisdom I imagined an older brother would impart upon me. When Deniz was my age, I realized with horror, I’d be 30. Would I be able to live up to my own demands? I was so nervous when I went to meet him at the hospital, no blocks in hand, that I felt sick to my stomach. I already felt distanced, so far away.
Unlike me, Odile and her motion sickness are not keen on distance. She usually asks whether I have a spare bag before the plane even takes off. But we’re closer in transit because of this. It’s one of the only times she lets me act like her older sister: I rub her back while she throws up, and she makes no objections as I discard the evidence and bring her the next bottle of water.
This spring break’s family trip is no exception for Odile, who is unsurprisingly sick. I go with her to the hospital on the second day; we return laughing with four prescriptions and orders to eat cautiously. At restaurants, we order the same kids’ meals for both Odile and Deniz: plain pasta with no sauce, not even butter. Cars and trains are put off the agenda indefinitely.
Unfortunately, we can’t avoid planes. In the airport before our return flight, I think about the past week of nearly perpetual travel, of unending motion sickness. Odile, Deniz, and I are all returning to different cities and different states. I wonder whether I’ve underestimated distance all along.
On the plane, the three of us make a show of preparing for take-off together. Deniz is still in awe of flying, which provides a distraction from Odile's nerves. So the three of us hold hands and look forward, as if we’re the pilots the whole plane depends on.
“Let’s do this!” Odile says, for Deniz’s benefit.
“C’mon,” he replies. “Is that all you’ve got?” Odile and I look at each other, wondering what other expressions he might have picked up from TV shows. “Let’s light this up like a fire!” he suggests, his still-small voice rising. Then, to our confusion: “Let’s crack this open like a flame!”
We try to hide our laughter. “No,” Deniz continues, sensing it, “that wasn’t good enough.”
“I know,” I offer. “Let’s light this like a birthday cake candle!”
“Ohhh,” Deniz grins, anticipating his own new year, eagerly awaiting the time before then to rush past. “That’s good!”
The plane is moving on the runway now, and, of course, I make myself look back.
It’s only for a few minutes—confined within the impossible, momentary security of accelerating to 600 miles per hour—that we keep holding hands. Deniz eventually lets go to search for the bag of M&Ms and Kit Kat bar we’d stolen from the hotel. Odile follows suit, deciding she feels okay.
The on-screen flight tracker lists nearly 8,000 miles to our destination—a long ways to be up here, traveling, and enough time to realize that, when I look back, it’s not places I’m looking to at all.
Delphine Rodrik '14 is a History and Literature and Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations concentrator in Cabot House. She is proud of her strong stomach, except for at Grand Elections.

On a recent Wednesday evening, four floors above Mt. Auburn Street in what is known as the “i-space,” a group of five Harvard students had claimed one small, stuffy office room to discuss the impending launch of their startup. Laptops open, bullet points scrawled on a whiteboard opposite a Rosie the Riveter poster, the group shifted easily between brainstorming and casual jokes.
“We need to think about the timeline,” said Brandon G. Gerberich ’14, regarding the April 11 launch of Padibility, a roommate matching and housing referral service that has so far garnered 138 “likes” on Facebook. “Quick manual feedback is going to be very tough.” Gerberich is technically the team’s chief data science officer, but in a small team, anyone can and does chime in.
“How GIF-based do we want the survey to be?” Timothy S. Hopper ’14 asked.
“We have to make sure we’re getting important info,” countered Angie Peng ’14.
“They could be a reflection of personality,” said Naji A. Filali ’14. “Conflict resolution, personal values.”
“Right,” Hopper said, speculatively: “If they like the same kind of GIF they might be the same kind of person.”
All the group’s members are currently enrolled in ES95r: “Startup R & D,” taught by lecturer Paul B. Bottino, who is also the executive director of Technology and Entrepreneurship Center at Harvard. Students interested in the course must form a team, present their project, and respond to questions, before being selected for an intensive, field-based class meant to assist in developing ideas and planning implementation.
“Taking Paul Bottino’s class is just huge,” said Yohei Oka ’14. This year, Oka, Paul Koullick ’14, and Eduardo Lopez Beeche ’14 founded OFORO, an organization that works with healthcare non-profit Partners in Health to donate one condom in Malawi for each condom sold. “You get to spend all the time you’d normally spend in a class working on your ideas.”
ES95r is just one example of an increasing number of courses, spaces, and resources for students interested in entrepreneurship at Harvard. David A. Edwards teaches ES20: “How to Create Things & Have Them Matter,” while Business School professors Mihir A. Desai and David L. Ager taught the second iteration of a popular United States in the World class, “Innovation and Entrepreneurship: American Experience in Comparative Perspective” last fall. The TECH space in the Square takes its place next to the Harvard Innovation Lab, or i-Lab, across the Charles River, founded in November 2011. And multiple University-based challenges offer competition and funding to select startups, including the i3 challenge that dispensed $50,000 in funding to finalists last week. Why the recent upsurge in interest? “Partially because of Mark Zuckerberg,” Oka speculated, “and these big, shiny, new deals.”
“Everyone and his grandmother is working on some sort of startup,” wrote Jacob R. Drucker ’15 in a Crimson op-ed last week. But students, increasingly, are finding that they can pursue fame and fortune, or at least a cool idea, without having to follow the Facebook founder in dropping out of school. And Harvard, increasingly, seems invested in keeping them here.
That’s not to say that it’s easy. Brooke K. Nowakowski ’16 and John M.A. McCallum ’16, whose sprayable batter concept, Spray Cake, was one of the $10,000 winners at the i3 challenge finals held at the Charles Hotel last Thursday, admit that juggling schoolwork and college life with starting a business and contacting sponsors has been a challenge. “Businesses are usually operating on nine-to-five hours,” said Nowakowski, “so you’re making calls in between lecture and section or lab—you’re scrambling sometimes.” But the project itself was firmly based at Harvard from the start. The duo developed their project in Paul Bottino’s ES95r class, while the idea initially arose from taking the popular Gen Ed course SPU 27: “Science and Cooking.”
“You get so much great feedback,” said Nowakowski of ES95r, “and you really plug into a group of entrepreneurs who are staying in school.”
Students in the course note that the projects can take on the status of a full-time job—Filali recalled one classmate filling out his daily work chart with sleep, an hour of swimming, and startup development, with a few spare hours for class penciled in.
“You have those kids who spend 24/7 on their startup,” said Peng. But for others, it’s a matter of priority. Sam R. Peinado ’15, together with Sarah L. Gondela ’13, created HuePick, a device shaped like a toothpick that instantly detects allergens in food, and another winner of the i3 challenge.
“My full-time job is to be a student,” said Peinado. Having been accepted to ES95r this semester, Peinado chose to take another course instead, while working with HuePick on the side. That said, he admitted “I am also taking a class pass-fail, so that I’ll have more time to work on the company.”
Unlike Stanford or Penn, Harvard does not offer directly pre-professional concentrations like business or marketing. But with the gradual introduction of courses in entrepreneurship or that employ business school-style case studies, the boundary between the liberal arts and the professions has slowly started to blur. Harvard’s growing support for rather than suspicion of entrepreneurship on campus can probably be traced to the turn of the 21st century: what Bottino calls “internet 1.0.” It was in 2000 that Bottino founded TECH, encouraged by then-Dean of the Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Venkatesh “Venky” Narayanamurti, who had worked at the famed AT&T Bell Laboratories. Before then, since at least the 1930s, the Harvard Student Handbook had forbidden students from operating businesses on campus. Then-Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 initiated the change of language to permit businesses to operate after undergoing a review committee process. Several years later, the handbook was again rewritten to remove that regulatory function. Today, it reads:
Harvard permits undergraduates to undertake modest levels of business activities on campus. Students may be required to move businesses entirely off-campus should they disrupt residential life, compromise the educational environment, or jeopardize the nonprofit status of the University or any exemption of its income or property from federal, state or local taxation.
“I like to say that, before 2000, it was the renegade era,” said Bottino, taking a break from preparing for the announcement of the i3 challenge finalists, on the second-floor ballroom of the Charles. “If you were a student wanting to do this, it was under the cover of darkness.”
“In a relatively short time,” he went on, “we went from renegade to regulated to resourced.”
Bottino, whose thick gray hair belies a youthful countenance and earnest gaze, is convinced that the resources offered by Harvard make dropping out or taking a leave of absence often unnecessary and relatively rare. “So many of the teams are in this early development stage,” he said. “So many of them are geared toward college audiences. There’s definitely an advantage to being amongst talented people, being amongst people that can help you either with product development or their potential market segment.”
Many founders of recent startups at Harvard would agree. “We’ve met with tutors in our Houses who have phenomenon expertise that we’ve been able to benefit from,” said Hopper, a member of the Padibility team. “Once you’re out on your own, you’d be paying these people $150 an hour for their time, but because they’re your tutors, they’re willing to meet with you.”
For some, Harvard’s support has continued past graduation. As of this year, the Innovation Lab in Allston hosts three Dean’s Challenges in Cultural Entrepreneurship, Health and Life Sciences, and Design, in addition to the President’s Challenge for social entrepreneurship. With hundreds of thousands of dollars to be dispensed, the challenges have the potential to transform a startup from a class project into a full-fledged business. All four, according to the i-Lab website, are open only to teams that include at least one matriculated, degree-seeking Harvard student (or a postdoctoral fellow or clinical fellow). While others can be involved, the Harvard student or students must be substantive members of the team—and prize money can only be awarded to Harvard students.
These qualifications were ideal for Six Foods, a startup that creates edible insect recipes to promote health and sustainability. Founded by college roommates Rose Wang ’13-’14 and Laura E. D’Asaro ’13, in addition to Meryl F. Natow ’13, the project was accepted into the i-Lab’s Venture Incubation Program last fall, and was able to become a finalist for the Dean’s challenge in Design because Wang, having taken a semester off, did not graduate until December.
Wang and D’Asaro are effusive in their enthusiasm for the project. “There are all these resources, there are workshops, they give you access to legal advice, business advice,” said D’Asaro. Long interested in entrepreneurship, D’Asaro had found upon arriving to campus almost four years ago that, other than Harvard Student Agencies, there wasn’t much available in which to get involved. “When the i-Lab opened, that was an absolute game-changer,” she said.
The Lab’s sleek, all-white offices, with inspirational quotes and ideas scribbled onto erasable-board columns, do seem more out of a trendy West Coast tech company than part of Harvard’s campus. Teams of students from the College and across the University gather at different brainstorming tables or in glass-walled offices, while some take breaks to avail themselves of the free coffee and fully stocked pantry of snacks, candy, and Ramen in the center of the space.
For some students, startups and startup culture offer an alternative to what they see as impersonal, low-impact careers in the corporate world. Wang, for example, had spent summers working for Abercrombie and Fitch and Microsoft before deciding to focus on Six Foods. “I had been looking for an opportunity to make a big impact on an organization as well as be a key decision maker,” she said, “and that doesn’t really happen in a corporate environment.”
“At Abercrombie I really struggled with the values of the company,” Wang added. “Ever since then, I’ve been searching for something I can put my time into that I think is really valuable.”
The “innovation” buzzword is important, as well. “I feel like a lot of CS, applied math people want to do something that’s not banking or consulting or going to a big IT company,” said Oka, one of the OFORO founders. “I guess that’s why people study CS in the first place: they’re interested in technology, and building something from nothing—from zero— is exciting.”
Of course, according to one recent estimate from Harvard Business School lecturer Shikhar Ghosh, three out of four startups fail. The image of the overnight billionaire who founded the next viral iPhone app, while seemingly attainable to students whose dorm rooms bear the shadows of coding gods Zuckerberg and Gates, is often no more than a mirage. But for students who are wary of leaving college and no longer having a voice, such immediate impact and results can be attractive. And for those who choose to stay in school, for whom the projects can remain a side venture, the risk-reward analysis can be even more favorable.
In an April 2012 story in The New Yorker, staff writer Ken Auletta traced the increasingly intimate relationship between Stanford University and Silicon Valley. Auletta argued that the connections, in many ways, prompted greater innovation among students and professionals. But, he added, “Stanford’s entrepreneurial culture has also turned it into a place where many faculty and students have a gold-rush mentality and where the distinction between faculty and student may blur as, together, they seek both invention and fortune.”
In some ways, Harvard seems eager to catch up with its peers. “We’ve got all the right ingredients for a startup culture,” said Bottino. The explosion of spaces and resources in the past five to ten years would seem to suggest that administrators, if not keen to nudge the university toward pre-professional avenues, are at least wary of being left behind.
But in other ways, many of those involved with “startup culture” on campus are eager to distance themselves from the monetized, pre-professional attitude of Silicon Valley. “I’ve looked at this whole experience as a learning experience,” said Peinado. For him, Harvard’s embrace of entrepreneurship reflects this kind of understanding. “It’s not just trying to get a job after college,” he said, “it’s also that I want to get an experience in this space.... The college does value—and it should value—that process of bringing something to fruition.”
Peng, too, distinguished her experience from that of other schools. At Stanford, she said, everyone wants to found a startup, “but then it becomes something you have to just check off.” Harvard students, she said, are more likely to pursue a project because they truly believe in it, rather than because it’s a fad. But, she suggested, this is changing. “[Harvard startup culture] is becoming more and more buzz-y,” Peng said, particularly in certain spheres: “You just can’t avoid it if you’re doing CS at Harvard.”
The Padibility team was clear to identify itself as a far-from-typical startup group. If it were not for ES95r and the i-space it’s unclear whether they’d be launching a company at all. OFORO similarly stemmed not from a burning idea that its founders were eager to put into action, but an interest in entrepreneurship and a desire to work on a project: “We just wanted to do something together,” said Oka. Rather than creating the “next big thing,” the emphasis, at least ideally, seems to be more on the process of creation and development than on a company in which professors would want to invest.
In some ways, then, Harvard’s support of innovation and entrepreneurship seems to be doing less to cultivate the undiscovered Zuckerbergs of the world—the students who probably would drop out anyway—and more to encourage startup culture in places it didn’t necessarily exist before. Some winners of the i3 and Dean’s challenges have gone on to become successful businesses; others have faded into obscurity, willing or unwilling casualties to be trampled under the swiftly churning cogs of tech.
But the possibility that the next big idea is being hatched, on 67 Mt. Auburn Street or 125 Western Ave. or on the second floor of the Charles Hotel, is enough of a thrill to keep the operation going, at least for now. And in some ways, the questions being asked are not so different than those being asked in the Barker Center or in Sever Hall. “What Harvard has taught us is to be thoughtful about the process,” said Wang. “How do we make our argument relevant? What does it mean to make impact?”
Added D’Asaro, “Why do we do the things we do? And if it doesn’t make sense, why not change it?”

Due to last year’s renovations of Stone Hall, Quincy residents can no longer store their belongings on campus over the summer. Don’t know where to keep your stuff? No need to fret. FM has you covered with these eight alternative options.
01 | The SOCH
Seemingly unused during the school year, and with plenty of space out in suburban Quad-land, this might just be the ideal place to keep your stuff for the summer. You don’t even have to worry about getting a lock because no one would bother to visit, apart from the social studies offices, which are secretly hiding on the ground floor. The only issue will be finding it/getting there/fitting everything on the Quad shuttle.
02 | Elmwood
University President Drew Faust’s stately mansion between Brattle and Mount Auburn streets is another compelling option for those of you who know what it is (for those who don’t, it has its own Wikipedia page). Situated on four spacious acres to the east of campus, Drew probably doesn’t have a lot of spare time for R and R at home, and she’s an empty nester too.
03 | Science Center Plaza
There’s been a lot of mixed reviews of the Science Center Plaza. Designed by a professor at the Graduate School of Design, the plaza seems to be the product of a lot of time spent turning a big, flat, open space into a flatter, whiter open space with funky benches. Admittedly, it has worked well for the skating rink and the food trucks, and there was that big tent there in the summer. But storage is clearly its true calling. While it may not have met our campus’s social needs, it can be a common space for all the shit we don’t wanna bring home this summer. Well done, Common Spaces Initiative!
04 | Annenberg
Why stop at being the world’s second-largest collection of secular stained glass? The largest collection of storage boxes sounds way sexier.
05 | Lamont
Things I think of when I think of Lamont Library: starting Ec10 problem sets, struggling to do Ec10 problem sets, having nightmares in which Mankiw chases me brandishing supply and demand graphs, and not finishing Ec10 problem sets. Things I think of when I think of summer: sunshine, happiness, green grass, fun, relaxation, tans, swimming, and Bud Light actually tasting good (well, at least not bad). Do you see how incompatible these things are? It’s the College’s duty to prevent students from spending any time in Lamont during summer, when they should be frolicking in the sunshine and capitalizing on the only appropriate use of Bud Light. An easy solution that fixes two problems at once? Filling the whole goddamn place with boxes.
06 | Canada
The second-largest country in the world by area has only the 37th largest population? While Quincy has run itself out of space, Canadians must have it by the acre up there. I wager we can overcome our preconceptions of the country as a nice hat resting on top of the powerful shape of the contiguous US of A, learn its capital, and store our stuff there, all in one summer.
07 | Nowhere
The corporeal body is the root of all unhappiness. In order to free our minds, we must free our boxes. In order to free our boxes, we must have nothing. Yeaaah, man. (Meditation, or other consciousness-mediation, may be required for this option. Keep us posted on how that goes for you.)
08 | At Wellesley
We can leave our things there instead of them forgetting their things here.

A young Holyoke of the Class of 1746 chronicled the happenings at Harvard College before his admission: “1742, June 2. Foundation of the Chapel Laid Some part of ye begin’g of this month. [sic]” Thus he recorded the beginning of a symbolic change in the Harvard Yard: the construction of its first chapel. Despite the many religious commitments of Harvard men, who read the Scriptures multiple times in a day and practiced the teachings of the Bible, a century went by until Holden was built.
This particular shortcoming of the College, which had already finished its brew-house, buttery, and philosophy chamber, constituted a disturbance to its most devout students. The project to rectify this issue was begun using funds raised by Thomas Hutchinson, Class of 1727, on his trip to London. The charitable donation of £400 was delivered by Mrs. Holden, whose coat of arms still adorns the gable of the modest, Gregorian building. When the College did finally build its temple, somehow it never realized its mission.
Holden Chapel lost its ecclesiastical status irretrievably in 1766 when the Harvard Hall was built, and its ground level designated as the new College chapel. Three years later, Sir Francis Bernard declared the Chapel was to be the new meeting place for the House when the British troops came into town. In 1775, the militia took over the building during the Revolutionary War, and used it as a general utility room: the chapel barracked Washington’s troops.
During its tumultuous early years, the Chapel deteriorated as a result of its service to the state and the Revolutionary War. It sat in silent disrepair in the corner of the Yard for years. In 1783, the auspicious Dr. Warren, Class of 1771 and founder of the Harvard Medical School, laid his healing hand on the Chapel and planned to convert it into an amphitheater.
Over two centuries later, on a summer day in 1999, some construction workers hit a round brick object under the Holden Chapel. When their curious eyes rested on what looked like human remains, archaeologists were called to the scene.
Accompanied by Christina J. Hodge, an archaeologist and lecturer for the course, Archaeology of Harvard Yard, I walk down the red shelves in the Peabody Depository. We stop at letter “H” and start pulling drawers full of objects from the Holden excavation. The broken glass tubes are tainted with rainbows of arsenic, mercury, and lead. The matrix that the artifacts were salvaged from was mostly organic matter, Hodge tells me. Organic mush sifted through the big, round, brick dry well.
We look at brown bones stained with red pigment here and there, and a grey piece of coral. Hodge says that the most interesting finds have been a shoe, and a set of buttons. These personal items suggest that the remains are from cadavers that were displayed, in full dress, at the amphitheater.
The recreational activities of the students who frequented the Chapel are evidenced by a wine bottle and many, many oyster shells. Midnight raids on the Chapel to sneak out the remains for the purposes of room decoration were not unheard of. The lectures at the chapel were frequented by seniors, with permission of their parents and the payment of a fee. They lasted two to three hours and focused on examination of many kinds of human remains. When the medical school moved to Boston, along with the lectures, it left behind a small museum of specimens at the Chapel. Some of the specimens that were excavated in 1999 are on view as part of the “Body of Knowledge” exhibition at the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments in the Science Center.
After a renovation in 1880, Holden Chapel acquired the status that it holds today. Since then, crowds of a respectable size have congregated for music department events, elocution classes, and choir practice.
Surrounded by the newer halls of Stoughton, Hollis, Lionel, and Mower, Holden Chapel is often missed by the eager tourist’s camera. Having housed state officials, soldiers, fire trucks, human cadavers and chemicals, it has earned a well-deserved retirement.

When Ruo S. Chen ’12 walked through the Science Center two summers ago, he was in the midst of a downward spiral. He had recently graduated from Harvard and broken up with his longtime girlfriend. He had started drinking a lot as a way, he says, to run away from his problems—sinking deeper and deeper into a self-described depressed state.
“I was going through some heartbreak, and it was tough,” he sighs. “I didn’t know it could be so tough.”
Former Harvard starting quarterback Collier W. Winters ’12 approached Chen that day in the Science Center. Winters invited Chen to Bible study at the Boston Church of Christ, a branch of the International Church of Christ, a Christian movement that has spread worldwide.
Winters’s outreach to Chen, a process known as “cold contact” in the Church, convinced Chen to give the community a try. “When he came up to me I was like, ‘Sure, why not?’” Chen says.
The church’s many detractors could have given Chen several reasons not to follow Winter’s lead. The International Church of Christ has generated much controversy over the years, accused by its detractors of psychological manipulation, cult-like behavior, and religious fanaticism. It has spawned websites devoted to detailing its supposedly malevolent machinations and innumerable articles and exposés. At one time, the Harvard administration itself advised students to be wary of the ICOC. Yet despite warnings and cautionary tales, it is the Boston branch of this very church that has attracted dozens of Harvard students over the years and counts several Harvard alumni among its leadership.
Chen may not have known about the church’s contentious past and present, but, from his perspective, perhaps it was for the best that he remained blissfully ignorant of the controversy. Speaking two years later, Chen sees Collier’s outreach as a fortuitous intervention into his life. “I think God made a miracle for me,” he says. “I met [Collier] at the right time when I needed him most.”
The BCC’s critics, including Harvard students and alumni disaffected by their experiences with it, allege that the church promotes intrusiveness into its members’ lives and aggressively pressures recent recruits into adult baptism. Its proponents, which have likewise included dozens of Harvard students and alumni over the years, counter that while conservative Christianity is not for everyone, the BCC provides a supportive outlet for exploring their faith.
A consideration of what draws Harvard students to a historically controversial conservative church a commute away from Harvard Square reveals that for many a desire to explore their faith and find a supportive community can take them to a place startlingly different from the campus they must leave to get there.
A HUG WITH YOUR SUNDAY
A 30-minute commute from the Red to the Green line on the T can take you to 180 Berkeley Street in downtown Boston. At 10 a.m. each Sunday, the Boston Church of Christ holds services there in the John Hancock building.
The “church” looks more like a dilapidated office building from the outside, and a set of stairs leading down to a basement appears ominous, but they lead to a convention-sized room that has been refurbished into a place of worship. And in that room and its offshoots, it’s all smiles and friendliness—even when I identify myself as a reporter.
When I ask to borrow a forty-something man’s pen, he gives me the pen and a hug. In fact, most people I interviewed went in for a hug.
When I sit down alone, a kind looking elderly woman immediately asks me if I want to sit with her. The deacon, the minister, and a high-level member of the church come up to me at various points and ask me how I’m enjoying myself. All of a sudden, the singing has begun, and I’m clapping along to Christian inspirational music, South African folk songs, and psalms performed by church members strumming on guitars. I notice a fellow Harvard College student sitting a few rows behind me, but this is a far cry from HUDS Sunday brunch.
If your mental image of devout Christianity combines some sort of Amish mysticism with extreme conservatism and austerity, you would be well off the mark for this group. The crowd is strikingly diverse and relatively young, even though on this Sunday the church is missing more than 100 college-age members who are away on the New England campus retreat this weekend. The first person I meet is wearing skinny jeans and a cardigan; a group of confident twenty-something women whom I speak with after service don trendy wrap scarves.


Offering communion this morning is none other than Chen, who became involved with the Church after his Science Center encounter with Collier. In contrast to the generally casually dressed crowd, Chen wears khakis, a button-up white shirt, and tie. He urges those present to stop spending so much time preparing for things that might not happen, like medical school, and prepare for what will definitely happen—death.
He offers an anecdote from his sophomore year at Harvard, when he finished finals and immediately dashed to the liquor store to start off an evening dedicated to blowing off steam. “It was time for me to play hard,” he says. The crowd offers words of encouragement as he speaks, shouting, “That’s right” and “Uh huh” as he continues.
Living in darkness, in “lust,” he says, was easier than coming toward the light. Yet after starting Bible study, getting baptized, and eliminating “negative influences” in his life such as Facebook, Chen said he had found the light.
“The gates to Heaven are narrow, not many are going to walk through,” says Chen, referring to the New Testament. After hearing about the evils of Facebook, drinking, and “lust,” I’m feeling worlds—rather than mere T stops—away from Sunday morning at Harvard, where strong religious belief can be met with skepticism and recounting Saturday night escapades more often than not involves one of the above.
ORIGINS AND OVERVIEW
Chen’s speech doesn’t seem radically different than those one might hear at any conservative Christian church, but the church to which he belongs has faced a barrage of criticism over the years.
Indiana native Kip McKean founded the International Church of Christ in Lexington, Mass. in 1979 in response to what he viewed as diminishing adherence to scripture among evangelicals. By 1992, Time had labeled the movement a “global empire.” It has rapidly evolved into a network of more than 650 churches in 155 nations.
As the movement grew, so, too, did a crescendo of criticism of the church’s practices. The website reveal.org, founded in 1996 and currently in operation, details alleged instances of psychological manipulation, forced uniformity, and “browbeating,” by the International Church of Christ. The Crimson has run several features detailing criticisms of the Boston Church of Christ, but the church has slipped under the radar for over a decade and continues to attract Harvard students and alumni.
Yelun “Lue” D. Qin ’10, who briefly got involved with the Boston Church of Christ as a sophomore at the College, notes that he and others found the church through first-hand experience to be too involved in its members’ personal lives and overly concerned with aggressive recruitment.
Recounting that he felt pressured to attend church events five or six days a week, Qin notes, “They begin to isolate you from other people. They slowly draw you away from other types of communities to become primarily involved  in their community.”
“A lot of things that they teach I would say most of the Christian churches and groups around would say ‘Yeah, I agree with that,’” says Qin. “It’s that 2 to 3 percent that’s kind of off.”
Part of the 2 to 3 percent to which Qin refers is the church’s emphasis on adult baptism, which critics say can lead to a very narrow definition of who is saved and who is not. Certainly, Chen expounded on those “narrow gates” during his speech at Sunday service.
“Not only do you need to be baptized to become a member, you need to be baptized to be considered saved,” says Jasmine, a senior at the College whose name has been changed because she feared the negative repercussions of speaking about becoming disaffected with the Church. Jasmine says she felt pressured to immediately get baptized after getting involved with the Church.
More websites have popped up, exposés have been written, but the church has weathered the storm of criticism and continues to grow. It currently has about 3,000 members and has attracted dozens of Harvard students and alumni over the years. Harvard alumni dot the lists of its leadership, including Winters and his fellow Harvard football teammate Josue Ortiz ’12.
COUNTERING THE CRITICISM
Church members and leadership counter that they have simply been misunderstood. “When you have a Church that has several thousand people there are obviously people who are going to be disillusioned,” says Douglas Arthur, the lead evangelist for the Boston Church of Christ.
Arthur contends that the church does not, in fact, believe that one has to be baptized by it specifically in order to be saved, but you do have to be baptized as an adult. “There is a seriousness about our faith,” he says. “There’s a personal righteousness. We teach against premarital sex, which is pretty extreme to some people.”
“In terms of the basic teachings of the Bible,” he explains, “we are in many respects a fairly normal conservative Christian church.”
Many members of the church are attracted to its strict adherence to scripture. “I’ve always been a guy that wanted to see in writing something that people were telling me to do,” says Deacon Daryl W. Owens.
“For me this is the first place that I found that someone was able to sit me down and show me everything in the Bible that was happening,” he says.
Chen concurs, “People think we’re judgmental, people think we’re weird, stuck up. We just want to obey God.” The Bible, he continues, “is not like a novel you’re reading. The word came from God.”


“That’s why I like this church the best, because you don’t come up with some random BS argument of your own self-belief,” he says.
In some ways, the church’s emphasis on strict interpretation of the Bible—a “common sense” interpretation, in the words of Arthur—provides the antithesis of a liberal arts college’s emphasis on finding one’s own specific interpretation of a text. The College, in fact, offers a course entitled “The Bible as Literature.”
Members of the church are referred to as “disciples of Christ.” The disciple structure has been central to the movement from the beginning, pairing up a recently baptized or soon-to-be baptized member with someone more experienced in the church.
When I mention the word “discipler” at the Downtown Church location, I’m met with suspicious eyebrow-raising by members used to enduring a succession of take-down pieces from the press.
“Discipling, it’s a verb, and it’s also a mutual give and take,” notes Amorette, a member who declined to give her last name. “But I think that’s a lot of what we try to do...encouraging one another, calling one another higher towards God.”
Owens counters that the disciple system is primarily a mutually beneficial mentorship. “When my daughter goes off to college hopefully some girl will take her under her wing, and she can turn to that person for advice.” A discipler, he says, plays that role of advisor.
He continues, “It’s a big lonely world. Sometimes you just need someone to go to.”
SEEKING A COMMUNITY
Indeed, those Harvard students and alumni that have become involved with the BCC cite a desire for an accepting community as a prime explanation for that involvement. “At the time when I was brought into the church I was feeling so lonely,” says Jasmine.
She continues, “To now all of a sudden have all of these people wanting to spend time with you and wanting to hang out with you was so different from what I’d experienced at Harvard up to that point.”
Qin concurs, “Someone who feels maybe isolated or not being cared for I think that’s a draw,” he explains. “You think, ‘Wow, people want to invest in me.’ Anyone would like that feeling.”
Such explanations shed light on how the church has attracted Harvard students and alumni despite the time commitments inherent in membership.
Harvard students, like all college students, often turn to smaller communities within campus for support in dealing with the problems of being away from home and navigating a complicated and often intimidating university. This desire for support need not always manifest itself in joining Crimson Key or a sorority. Sometimes, it can take people outside the Harvard bubble, toward groups they might not have previously considered joining.
Chen, who views his experience with the Church positively, says, “Harvard is a weird environment. It can get very competitive at times, and a lot of times people don’t share their real problems. That’s what I think Harvard is; people need to get more real.”
“Sometimes I feel like in the world, we just need someone to talk to,” he continues. “You ever realize at a party someone who’s really quiet suddenly gets really talkative after a few shots? We all need someone to talk to.”
“Other churches felt more like a club to me,” says Ariana, a female member who declined to give her last name. She decided to stick with the church even after her family changed churches when she was a teenager. Drawn to the church’s tight-knit community, she felt like she had found a group she could trust.
“With Christianity comes a certain sense of vulnerability,” she says. “Because if your goal is to be more like Jesus it means you’re called to talk about areas of your life that are not like Jesus, which means you’re called to talk about areas of your life that aren’t fun to talk about.”
Both Chen and Ariana currently live with people they met through the church.
Jasmine, who was not religious growing up, explains the origins of her involvement. “I was at a point where I was not really sure about Harvard,” she says. “If not for all the creepy stuff later I would have been happy staying, because you’re happy.”
“You don’t realize that you’re there all the time, you don’t think ‘Why do they have an unusual amount of involvement in my personal life? Why are they texting and calling me?’ Because you’re like, ‘We’re friends.’”
TIME COMMITMENT
When Jasmine refers to an unusual amount of involvement she expresses a concern that the church demands too much of a time commitment from its membership. Jasmine says that her discipler became overly involved in her life and ultimately made her feel extremely uncomfortable with the church. “For me it went from sunshine and rainbows to really creepy really fast,” she says.
Jasmine first got involved with the church when a fellow undergraduate asked her if she wanted to attend Bible study. One Bible study progressed to multiple Bible studies per week, and soon Jasmine says she was spending six days a week at BCC sponsored events.
The BCC members I spoke to stated that they attended service on Sundays, a mid-week service on Wednesdays, and social gatherings or Bible study throughout the week. No one, however, seemed to be spending six days per week at BCC events. While multiple Church events per week might seem like a lot to the average Harvard student, it’s certainly not outside the norm for devout Christians.
Qin also says that Bible study progressed to twice weekly services, social events, and smaller gatherings. He was eventually baptized by the church, but left the group after a fellow staff member at the Asian American Christian Fellowship voiced concerns about the church.
“Once they had your contact information,” he says, “they tended to contact a person insistently, saying, ‘Hey, we didn’t see you.’”
“They were communicating care, I think,” he reflects, “but it was a little suffocating at times. It borders on harassment.”
According to Jasmine, the church’s involvement in her life became excessive. She recounts being called multiple times per day by her discipler in addition to the many hours they spent together. She alleges that members of the church would often question her desire to leave Bible study to do her school work.
“They would be very disappointed in the fact that I was leaving to do my homework,” says Jasmine.
Qin also recalls being urged to prioritize Bible study and church events over his schoolwork when he was involved as an undergraduate.
“Oftentimes they would use the argument, ‘Just trust in God with your homework; what’s important is spending time with brothers and sisters in your faith,’” he says.
“Like any extracurricular,” counters Arthur, “if you take it on, it requires time management and discipline. We have Harvard students who do well academically, participate in sports, and are vibrant members of the church.”
GETTING PERSONAL
Jasmine says her relationship with the church demanded not only time, but also a re-evaluation of her personal life. Bible study often devolved into outright examination of her personal life and family relationships. In one notable instance, she alleges that her discipler asked her to confess to the sin of lust in front of the entire church membership. Her sin? Kissing someone at her House formal.
Arthur dismisses Jasmine’s claim as being preposterous. “People in the church kiss all the time,” he says.
The BCC allows for and, according to Jasmine, promotes dating among its membership as many churches do. Its singles ministry brings together single members in the New England area. Next weekend there will be an overnight singles retreat. “Specifically tailored classes will help us gain a better understanding that we have been Created,” advertises the church’s website.
A glance through the church’s online calendar reveals more church events including a “Girls Night Out” for teenagers in the Boston area (parental permission required).
Jasmine contends that the church goes further than other Christian organizations in promoting dating and marriage among its younger members. She also criticizes its tendency to set members up on “group dates,” that is dates with at least four members present rather than letting members go on dates on their own. A radical departure from undergraduate hook-up culture that some might feel goes too far in the other direction.
According to Chen, the Church’s dating culture is a positive element. “Dating is different in the church,” he says, “but I’m enjoying it.”
“In the world, when you go on a date there’s a lot of expectations,” he says. “We always go on a group date to protect [ourselves] from thinking those thoughts. It’s good to have someone there reminding you, ‘Hey, don’t think like that. It’s not gonna happen.’”
For Chen, the concept of getting to know women before starting a relationship contrasts with his Harvard experience. “Going to the culture of final clubs and all these things, you see all these things go down. You begin to lose respect for women, and once you lose that respect, you treat them differently, which is an underlying problem in our society,” he says.
“When women become more and more sexual, we are more likely to objectify you as things,” he says, pointing to me as I self-consciously pull my skirt down as far below my knees as possible.
“That’s why I appreciate the women here,” he says. “They respect themselves. They don’t have to wear extra small skirts or yoga pants.”
A LIFESTYLE
The sermon on the day I attended the downtown service was delivered by Larry Reed, a jovial and friendly bald man with a booming voice. He spoke about eliminating worrying from our lives. After all, worrying accomplishes nothing, but if we devote time spent worrying to prayer it can help us in innumerable ways he says.
While Reed referred to Christ and specific passages in the text often in his sermon, his speech that week and the previous one, which focused on “complaining,” certainly would have resonated with many non-Christian Harvard students.
Reed came up to me after the service. He cracked jokes and offered himself as a friendly face for me as I navigated the church. “How are you doing?” he asked me.
The church and its detractors will continue to disagree over whether it’s a positive or negative force in its often young membership’s lives. Even as this debate rages, it will recruit and draw from Harvard’s population, probably drawing in many students and alumni even as it repels others away.
“I just want them to experience it and see what it’s about,” says Chen.
“It’s not like an army or some kind of cult you join. It’s a lifestyle you choose. Here is where we come true to our true self,” he says, taking a breath. “You gotta come clean.”

The Cambridge Police Department issued a citizen’s alert last week warning that thieves in the area have used devices called skimmers, which attach to ATMs, to gain access to personal bank account information. According to the alert, thieves gained access to accounts on at least seven occasions between Nov. 2013 and Jan. 2014.
 
A skimmer is a disguised mechanical device fitted over the card reader of an ATM. When a customer inserts a bank card, the skimmer records the card number as it enters the card reader. Some skimmers also include cameras, which film the machine’s keypad as the customer enters his or her PIN.
 
Jeremy Warnick, the director of communications and media relations for the department, said that some skimmers were also placed over the outdoor card readers that some banks use to allow customers to enter bank lobbies or ATM foyers after hours.
The department would not specify which banks or ATMs were affected nor did the April 4 citizen's alert.
 
The police alert stated that thieves used the card numbers they acquired from skimmers around Cambridge to extract “an undisclosed amount of cash from the compromised accounts in New York City.”
 
Customers who were affected noticed the decrease in money in their accounts and notified the bank, Warnick wrote in an email. Depending on their protection and insurance policies, some banks may reimburse customers for the amount of money stolen from their accounts.
 
According to the police report, Cambridge police are working to inform local banks and regional bank managers about ATM schemes, and patrol officers are placing special attention on ATMs after bank hours.
 
Warnick also noted that the CPD is “working with federal agents on an investigation.”
 
The FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division declined to comment on the issue. The Harvard University Police Department could not be reached for comment for this story.
 
The Citizen’s Alert urged citizens to take several precautions. According to the alert, customers should “be suspicious if you see anything loose, crooked, damaged, or if you notice scratches or tape residue,” cover the keypad when entering a PIN, and use an indoor ATM away from tourist areas when possible. Citizens suspicious of ATM fraud should contact the Cabridge police.

The Charles River Conservancy has initiated a movement to petition the Massachusetts Department of Transportation to build underpasses for pedestrians and cyclists beneath the Anderson Memorial, Western Ave., and River St. bridges along the Charles River.
“This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to create seven miles straight of uninterrupted path,” said Renata von Tscharner, the president and founder of the Charles River Conservancy.
Members of the Conservancy, which works to promote greater accessibility and use of the river, said these underpasses would increase safety, promote a shift towards healthier transportation, and encourage recreation and tourism.


The Conservancy hopes to acquire funding for the project from Massachusetts Department of Transportation’s Accelerated Bridge Program, a $3 billion initiative to rebuild 200 Massachusetts bridges over the course of eight years.
ABP funding usually goes towards general bridge renovations that usually do not include underpasses, though. A renovation of this nature funded by the program has already commenced on the Anderson Bridge.
Activists said they now hope that MassDOT will allocate additional funds to construct an Anderson Bridge underpass, especially since the department announced last week that it would defer construction on the River St. and Western Ave. bridges until 2018 or 2019.
“The urgency now is to get underpasses incorporated into Anderson Bridge,“ von Tscharner said.
According to members of the Conservancy, it would be more cost-effective to begin construction on the underpasses now, since the Anderson Bridge is currently under construction. The Conservancy conducted a study that estimated that constructing all three underpasses would cost $3 million if MassDOT were to begin construction now. According to the study, the same project would cost $6 million if built later.
“Two principal arguments from MassDOT resisting the underpasses have been that it would take too long and that there are so many other demands under the ABP,” said Cambridge resident John G. Wofford ’57.
A campaign has formed to support the movement, drawing support from local public organizations, the Cambridge City Council, and elected officials, including Congresswoman Katherine M. Clark.
Von Tscharner noted that the issue should concern all Cambridge residents—particularly Harvard students.
“Harvard students, as the main users of the river, have been lured here with beautiful pictures of the Charles, but it’s actually very dangerous to cross,” von Tscharner said. “They can’t fully enjoy it.”
The Conservancy's urging aside, MassDOT spokesman Michael Verseckes said that the underpasses are simply not possible at present. The department is responsible for maintaining about 5,100 bridges across Boston, he said, and cannot provide further funding for renovating the 200 bridges included in the ABP at this time—let alone construct additional underpasses.
According to Verseckes, MassDOT has still made efforts to accommodate pedestrians and cyclists and has not ruled out the underpasses completely.
Von Tscharner, though, said she believes the department has not done enough.
“Their mission is to make all modes of transportation safe to travel,” von Tscharner said. “It’s time to apply this policy and pay for the expenses that benefit bikers and runners as well.”
Some students agreed that they would benefit from underpasses.
“I would be in favor of that,” Aaron J. Klein ’17 said. “I don’t like crossing that street especially because JFK is really busy.”

Winthrop House Resident Dean Gregg A. Peeples will take medical leave for the remainder of the spring semester, Winthrop House Masters Ronald S. Sullivan Jr. and Stephanie Robinson announced in an email this week. Adams House tutor Meghan Lockwood, who has previously served as acting resident dean in Adams and Quincy, will serve as Winthrop’s acting resident dean until Peeples’s return.
 
According to the House Masters’ email, which was sent over the Winthrop House list, Peeples will take a leave of absence “in order to fully heal” a significant knee injury.
 
In a follow-up email to the Winthrop community, Peeples wrote that he will continue teaching and will be “often around the House,” adding that residents will be “in very good hands” under Lockwood’s supervision.
 
Lockwood is a former middle school teacher and current doctoral student at the Harvard Graduate School of Education residing in Claverly Hall, according to her biography on the Adams House website. The House Masters wrote in their email that Lockwood “looks forward to getting to know the Winthrop community.”
 
Neither Peeples nor Lockwood could be reached for comment.

UPDATED: April 10, 2014, at 12:47 a.m.
Mexican food will continue to be served at the former home of Felipe’s Taqueria at 83 Mount Auburn St. when the The Taco Truck opens its first Boston storefront location in the space in the coming months.
Students familiar with The Taco Truck from its current mobile location outside the Science Center can expect to see much of the same menu at the planned brick and mortar location.
“We plan on opening somewhere between mid-May to sometime in June, in the next two to three months,” Kevin Nigro, the director of operations at The Taco Truck, said in an interview. “We plan on selling the same food that we’ve been selling out of the truck.”
Nigro noted that he may alter the menu slightly to include new dishes such as Elote, a corn dish that features cotija cheese and chili powder.
 
According to Nigro, The Taco Truck has been planning the move for a long time.
“It’s been a long time in the making,” Nigro said. “The final decision was made somewhere in December 2013, and we’d been working on it for months and months before that.”
According to Nigro, Cambridge was an ideal place for The Taco Truck—which also has locations in New Jersey, New York, and Boston—to put down permanent roots.
“Cambridge is perfect and The Garage is a really well-known area in Cambridge,” Nigro said.
Nigro noted that part of what attracted The Taco Truck to Cambridge was its large student population.
“We feel like the College is going to take well to the food,” Nigro said. “We’ve been running the truck in Harvard two to three days a week, and we’ve been doing really well.”
According to Nigro, The Taco Truck will keep the same late hours as Felipe’s, remaining open until 2 a.m. on weekends.
 
Nigro said he does not anticipate any conflicts with Felipe’s, even though both Mexican restaurants offer similar cuisine. In fact, he thinks that selling tacos, not burritos, will distinguish The Taco Truck from other quick service restaurants in the area.
“There’s plenty of room for both of us,” Nigro said. “We hope that some of the guests that have been to Felipe’s will try us out.”
Before the Truck makes the official move, students can still purchase food from its mobile location at the Science Center on Saturdays. Even after the move is complete, Nigro still anticipates bringing the truck by the Science Center every so often.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said that she was excited about the news.
“If places stay vacant, people get concerned,” Jillson said. “I’m delighted to hear that the space is taken.”

An air of excitement filled the room Wednesday night as museum staff and community members crowded into Sackler Lecture Hall to hear about behind-the-scenes planning for the opening of the renovated Harvard Art Museums facility, set to open its doors this fall.


 
The night marked the fourth and final installment of “In-Sight Evening: Preparing for the New Harvard Art Museums,” an event series that began in 2012. The series has let museum organizers offer updates on the planning and vision for the new facility, which will combine all of Harvard’s art museums in a single location for the first time.
 
On Wednesday night, Jessica L. Martinez ’95, the director of the Museums’ Division of Academic and Public Programs, provided attendees with a preview of what the new building will look like. She also discussed new features of the facility, such as study spaces and a lightbox gallery.
 
As an example of the curatorial work that has been done in preparation for the opening, the presentation shifted to a discussion of an installation set to debut in the fall: "'Untitled' (Portrait of Michael Jenkins)" by Félix Gonzáles-Torres.
 
The portrait, which will be a permanent installation on the third floor of the newly renovated Calderwood courtyard, consists of words and dates that were significant to Michael Jenkins’s life and features important historical moments that took place while he was alive. To install the art, museum staff needed to either add or delete the words that Gonzáles-Torres had created.
 
Mary Schneider Enriquez, the Museums’ associate curator of modern and contemporary art and presenter of the portrait, acknowledged that the work, which contains only text, differs from traditional portraits.
 
“Who we are is much more than our image,” she said, emphasizing the importance of Gonzáles-Torres’s contribution to portraiture.
 
The Harvard Art Museums worked with members of the Student Guide program to brainstorm how Harvard could add to Gonzáles-Torres’s work. The undergraduates ultimately contributed four words and dates to the portrait to mark important moments in the world and in their lives related to Harvard. One word and date combination commemorates a student’s story of her Harvard application process.
 
Event attendee Ellen G. Reeves ’83, a fellow at the art museums and the former president of the Harvard Alumni Association, said that she was excited about how the Museums could create a gathering space for the Harvard community, from alumni to College students.
 
“The Art Museums are offering more to the undergraduates than ever before,” she said.

In a speech that echoed an op-ed published Wednesday in the Boston Globe, President of the Republic of Ecuador Rafael Correa told an audience at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum Wednesday night that the economic situation in Ecuador has improved rapidly over the last few years, but is still inhibited by economic, political, and legal inequalities.
Although Kennedy School of Government Dean David T. Ellwood ’75 introduced Correa as a controversial figure, the Ecuadorian president's 50-minute speech, which was delivered in English, avoided most of the controversial topics, such as human rights and freedom of speech infringement, which have caused some U.S. citizens to view his presidency as corrupt and authoritarian.
Audience members nevertheless used the 30-minute question and answer segment at the end of the speech to inquire about Correa’s policies.
When a Kennedy School student in the audience asked Correa about Ecuador’s increasing infringement on the freedom of the press, Correa responded, “that is not true, I don’t know who tells you that.”
“Come to our country,” he added. “You will see yourself.”
Most of Correa’s speech highlighted the improving situation in Ecuador, including a sharp decrease in poverty levels and increase in higher education. The event began with a short tourism advertisement highlighting the natural beauties of Ecuador with the message, “All you need is Ecuador. Ecuador is all you need.” 
Correa took pride in distancing himself from the presidents that led Ecuador before the new constitution was written and put into place soon after Correa took office in 2007.
Citing the fact that Ecuador went through seven presidents in 10 years, Correa emphasized that the current situation in Ecuador is extremely different than it was a decade ago.
“Ecuador was an example of everything that could go wrong with a country,” Correa said. “Today, Ecuador is one of the most distinguished democracies in Latin America.”
 
According to Correa, democracy is in full effect in Ecuador today.
“Democracy has been freely established in Ecuador. Not only a democracy in the formal sense, but real democracy in terms of people’s access to rights, equal opportunities, and dignified conditions,” Correa said. “This is the so-called Ecuadorian miracle.”
Correa said that it is now time to move Ecuador and its surrounding countries past the inequalities that have been of serious concern over the last several decades, citing a wide disparity in wealth.
“In Latin America, where not just economic but political and legal inequalities plague our continent, seeking justice is the only way to achieve true freedom,” Correa said.
About 1,100 people entered the lottery on the Institute of Politics’ website to attend Correa’s address, but the room was capped at its capacity of 750, according to IOP Director of Communications Esten Perez.
Correa was educated in Latin America, Europe, and the United States, and referred fondly in his speech to his time in the United States as “four of the happiest years of my life.” 
He is currently at the beginning of his tour of the Northeast that will include stops at MIT and Yale. He is traveling with a large contingent of ministry and cabinet members including Nathalie Cely, Ecuador’s Ambassador to the United States, all of whom were present at the forum on Wednesday.

UPDATED: April 10, 2014, at 8:25 p.m.
Less than a week after members announced they had filed a federal Title IX complaint against the University, organizers from Our Harvard Can Do Better, a student group advocating for modifications to Harvard’s sexual assault policy, held a teach-in event Wednesday.


The event aimed to educate students about Title IX, the rights that it grants, and the alleged problems with the Harvard’s current policies, as well as enlist interested students in the group’s cause.
 
The teach-in follows more than a week of campus discussion regarding sexual assault, including the creation of a University task force on the issue. Although the specifics have not been detailed, changes to the University’s Title IX policy are expected to reach completion soon, following the creation of a task force last spring.
 
Addressing a crowd that included the Undergraduate Council president and vice president and about 50 undergraduate and graduate students, group leaders discussed the legal components of Title IX and briefed attendees on the College’s current sexual assault policies. They then described how student activism might help eliminate perceived inconsistencies between Title IX and the College’s treatment of sexual assault, as well as modify stipulations related to issues of consent and the burden of proof required in cases brought before the College’s Administrative Board.
 
Emily M. Fox-Penner '17, an organizer for Our Harvard Can Do Better, outlined nine items about Title IX that she said everyone should know. Among these were the points that schools receiving federal funding are required to inform students and administrators of policies, cannot influence a student’s course of action in cases, and may not retaliate in any way against a complaint filer—something Fox-Penner said she thinks is “unfortunately...a reality” in many cases.
 
As it stands, Harvard is the only Ivy League university to uphold a policy based on negative consent, group organizer Pearl Bhatnagar ’14 said. Yale, for example, requires affirmative consent, or a “positive, unambiguous, and voluntary agreement to engage in specific sexual activity,” according to its Equal Opportunity Programs policy.
 
“Ultimately, [Harvard’s] definition obscures issues of violence by placing the burden on the survivor,” Bhatnager said. “The top reason why survivors don’t come forward...is because they feel that their sexual assaults are not sexual assaults enough.”
 
Organizers said they hope to expedite the pace of changes to the sexual assault policy and push for consistency across the University's various schools. To depict what they say are difficulties in effecting policy change, they drew a large flow chart of various campus administrators on the room’s chalkboard.
 
Still, organizer Kate Sim ’14 said that modifications to sexual assault policy have historically resulted from student advocacy. She pointed specifically to the creation of the Office of Sexual Assault and Prevention in 2003. 
Sim also expressed her frustration with what she alleges amounts to the refusal of administrators to assume responsibility for appropriate action against perpetrators of sexual violence.
 
“I don’t want to go to school with rapists and abusers, where I know administrators are knowingly allowing [them] to complete their education,” she said.
 
Mira S. Hayward ’17, who attended the event, said she was excited to get involved with further efforts of Our Harvard Can Do Better.
 
“I really don't want this to be something that is pushed to the side because people think that it is being addressed," Hayward said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 10, 2014, at 6:59 p.m.
More than 100 faculty members from across the University signed an open letter on Thursday urging University President Drew G. Faust and members of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, to divest the University's endowment from fossil fuel companies.
Citing evidence of global climate change and its destructive potential, the letter reads, “Our sense of urgency in signing this Letter cannot be overstated.”
“Divestment is an act of ethical responsibility, a protest against current practices that cannot be altered as quickly or effectively by other means,” the faculty members wrote.  It continues, “If the Corporation regards divestment as ‘political,’ then its continued investment is a similarly political act, one that finances present corporate activities and calculates profit from them.”
The letter, which gained more signatories as the day progressed, comes on the heels of a campus-wide email from Faust on Monday announcing that the University had signed on to the United Nations-backed Principles for Responsible Investment, a framework for investing with environmental, social, and governance issues in mind that also focuses on influencing the behavior of portfolio companies.
Despite offering a number of new climate change initiatives in addition to the PRI standards, Faust’s email reaffirmed the decision, first announced in Oct. 2013, that the University would not divest.
Thursday’s letter from members of the faculty takes aim at that stance, and in particular what those members call the University’s vague strategy of focusing on influencing corporate behavior rather than divesting.
“How, exactly, will the University ‘encourage’ fossil fuel corporations in ‘addressing pressing environmental imperatives’?  Will Harvard initiate or support shareholder resolutions?” the faculty members asked.
The letter casts doubt on Faust's assertions that divestment would negatively affect the University’s financial position.
“The President’s statements claim that while Harvard owns a very small fraction of these stocks representing a small fraction of its endowment, the University will exert greater influence if it continues to hold these shares than if it openly divests,” reads a summary of the letter. “This indicates a misunderstanding of the purpose and goals of divestment, and ignores the lessons of the past.”
Rather, the authors assert, the University has an “ethical responsibility” to divest “to expose corporate attitudes and change corporate behavior.”
“We the undersigned are faculty and officers of the University, many with knowledge and research in climate science, energy, business management, ethics, and the effects of climate change on health, prosperity, and biodiversity,” they wrote.
According to University spokesperson Kevin Galvin, Faust’s focus will remain on the initiatives she laid out in her written statements to “ advance the endowment’s paramount aim of supporting Harvard’s academic mission.”
“President Faust recognizes that how best to respond to the threat of climate change is a question on which thoughtful people hold differing views,” Galvin wrote in an emailed statement to The Crimson on Thursday afternoon.
One of the letter’s four principal authors, James M. Recht, an assistant psychiatry professor at the Medical School, said that he had been convinced over the past several months that climate change was a “bona fide public health emergency.”
“There may not be a university whose actions, at least in this realm, are as potentially influential as Harvard’s,” Recht said. “With power comes responsibility. It’s hard to predict, I think it would be a mistake to underestimate [divestment’s] potential effects.
Recht, along with History professor Joyce E. Chaplin, English and Comparative Literature professor James T. Engell '73 , and Classics professor Richard F. Thomas, all members of the Faculty of Art and Sciences, had been collaborating for about two months to collect signatures, mostly from faculty members who had already expressed their support in an online petition created by Divest Harvard—a student activist organization that calls for University fossil fuel divestment—according to Recht.
Shoshana Zuboff, a retired Business School professor and the only signatory representative of the Business School, said that the business model of fossil fuel companies is “unsustainable.
“On strictly business grounds, the era in which this kind of business model that externalizes these harms, in my view, that era is over,” Zuboff said. “The sooner firms reckon with that, come to grips with it, internalize it, and allow their business models and their conceptions of their businesses to evolve, the stronger those firms will be, the stronger our economies will be, and the stronger we’ll be.”
Other signatories include Kirkland House Master Tom C. Conley, History Department Chair David R. Armitage, and Director of the Harvard Forest David R. Foster. Every Harvard school except for the School of Dental Medicine was represented.

Freshmen students crowded into Annenberg Hall Wednesday night to have a taste of Ferrero’s famous chocolate hazelnut spread at the Undergraduate Council’s first Nutella-themed study break.
An unusually large group of freshmen attended the event, which was funded and run by the UC. The $900 the UC put into the event was prompted by student feedback that the Council gathered during Operation Ghost Protocol, its initiative to listen to and act on student requests and ideas.
“While we were doing Ghost Protocol, we asked students for things that they wanted,” said Charles A. Scherr '17, a freshman representative on the UC. “The number one thing students wanted was Nutella.”
The four 6.6-pound tubs of Nutella were accompanied by graham crackers, pretzels, and marshmallows.
Many attendees said they were surprised by the event.
“I found out through the [Harvard 2017] Facebook group,” said Julio C. Fierro '17. “It is really good. I really love what they did today.”
Carolyn R. Ye '17 said that she had no knowledge of the event before arriving.
“I found out [about the Nutella] just as I was walking into Annenberg,” she said. “I regularly go to Brain Break and the amount of people here is way larger than normal.”
Though freshmen could have taken any number of pretzels and other snacks that they wanted, UC members limited the amount of Nutella each person could get, using a scoop to put it on students’ plates. 
“Nutella is liquid gold,” Scherr said. “It’s really expensive, and there are reports of students from other colleges stealing Nutella. So we’re trying to avoid that here.”
The special break coincided with the end of the Economics 10b: “Principles of Economics” midterm exam, so students coming to Brain Break afterward said that they were especially glad to see the snacks.
“This [was] really convenient since this came right after the midterm,” Ye said. “I wish they did this after every major exam.”
Overall, students said that they enjoyed the study break and had few complaints, and some said they hoped it could happen again.
“It was really well run,” Fierro said. “I have nothing bad to say about it.”
Members of the UC said that they hoped to repeat this kind of study break in the future.
“Hopefully we will do this again before May,” Scherr said. “It’s really a great way to meet with our constituents.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard baseball team needed a break. And in the bottom of the eighth, with two outs and runners on second and third, the Crimson got it.
Junior shortstop Jake McGuiggan stepped to the plate and lofted a lazy fly ball down the right field foul line on the first pitch he saw in the tie ballgame against visiting Boston College. The Eagles right fielder sprinted in; the second baseman drifted out. The outfielder called out, “I got it!” only to have the ball drop at his feet.
Fair ball. Just like that, the Crimson had taken a 6-4 lead, its first of the game.
Although the Eagles managed a run in the top of the ninth, Harvard would hang on to defeat its crosstown rival, 6-5, in the first round of the Beanpot at O’Donnell Field Wednesday afternoon.
“It looked like it was going to be caught; it was a pop-fly,” sophomore outfielder Brandon Kregel said. “Luckily we had a strong gust of wind today, and the sun played into hit…. That’s luck. Sometimes that plays into it. Today, we got lucky and we did things right.”
However lucky, McGuiggan’s hit would go down as a two-run double in the scorebook. The knock capped a three-run bottom of the eighth for the Crimson that began when Kregel ripped his second double of the day to left field.
A strikeout followed by an infield single moved Kregel to third, bringing up sophomore third baseman Mitch Klug. The Crimson had already botched an earlier squeeze attempt, but Klug laid down a perfect bunt that allowed Kregel to dive headfirst into home to tie the game at four. McGuiggan would come through for his team just moments later.
While Harvard owned the later innings, it was all BC early on. Indeed, it seemed as if the Eagles would run away with the game when they stormed out of the gates to put four runs on the board in the first inning.
After retiring the leadoff hitter, Harvard freshman starting pitcher Kevin Rex surrendered two consecutive singles and walk to load the bases. BC’s Joe Cronin then smacked a double down the right field line to score a pair, and another run came home on an RBI groundout.
Two walks, a pitching change, and a wild pitch later, the Eagles had seized a 4-0 lead and seemed to possess all the momentum.
But that was all the scoring the BC offense could produce until the ninth inning, as a committee of Harvard relievers shut the door. Sophomores Nick Scahill and T.J. Laurisch, along freshman Greg Coman and junior Matt Timoney, combined to hold the Eagles scoreless for seven straight innings.
Of the four pitchers, Laurisch stood out the most. The sophomore contributed three-and-two-thirds innings of scoreless, one-hit ball. His most dominant frame came in the top of the sixth, when Laurisch set down the Eagles in order by working ahead and striking out two.
“I thought our bullpen did a wonderful job,” Harvard coach Bill Decker said. “It was a really good win for these kids…. We’re going to keep on going and try to develop our bullpen. It hasn’t always worked out for it, but today it worked out for us.”
Down four runs early, the Crimson offense systematically chipped away at the BC lead in the middle innings. In the bottom of the third, Klug led off with a hit-by-pitch and came around to score after an error and a McGuiggan RBI groundout.
After Laurisch held BC scoreless, the Crimson came right back with another run in the bottom of the fourth, as a single from junior outfielder Jack Colton plated classmate Mike Martin to make the score 4-2.
Harvard pulled within one in the bottom of the sixth. On a 2-0 count, Kregel saw a pitch he liked and launched it just short of the wall in right-center for a double.Kregel would eventually be tagged out attempting to score after a failed squeeze attempt. But BC miscues bailed the Crimson out, as an error followed by a bases-loaded hit batsman plated junior catcher Ethan Ferreira.
At this point, the Crimson had scored three runs on just three hits. Offense was hard to come by for Harvard all game—Kregel and Colton notched four of the team’s six total hits—and the top three hitters in the lineup went a combined 0-for-11.
It was the other way around for BC. Each of the team’s nine hits came from the third through sixth hitters, highlighted by a four-for-five performance from cleanup hitter Chris Shaw.
But Harvard’s scrappiness, timing, and a bit of good fortune—especially in the eighth—allowed the home team to finally pull ahead. Sophomore pitcher Sean Poppen took the hill in the ninth, and although he allowed a run, the team’s ace had enough gas to secure the save and notch the win for his team.
“It’s just about stringing hits together, not giving up, and putting the ball in play,” Kregel said. “Stuff like that, it’s baseball. You can’t ever give up, and I don’t think we did that today.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is not very often that one will find a lacrosse game in which a team won by more than tripling its opponent’s score.
That is exactly what the Harvard women’s lacrosse team did Wednesday night against Holy Cross, winning 16-5, which was the team’s first double digit win of the year.
The Crimson (7-4, 3-1 Ivy) took a break from conference play with a mid-week match up against the Crusaders (5-10, 3-3 Patriot League) in Worcester. The first half was when Harvard solidified its offense, scoring 10 goals in the opening 30 minutes of play, while holding Holy Cross to only one scoring drive.
During the first half the scoring was spread throughout the lineup, led by freshman attacker Marisa Romeo with three goals. Romeo leads the team in goals on the season with 37 and 43 points overall. After scoring just one goal in last week’s matchup against Brown, Romeo proved her offensive ability against the Crusaders.
Sophomore attacker Audrey Todd scored three goals in the game, extending her streak of hat tricks to three games. Todd is currently the second highest scorer on the team with 17 goals on the season. Todd also picked up two ground balls and six draw controls for the Crimson.
Other offensive threats included sophomore attacker Alexis Nicolia, who had three goals on the night as well as freshman midfielder Megan Hennessey and senior co-captain Kyleigh Keating who each had two goals in the game. Sophomore attacker Megan Bauer and freshman attacker Marina Burke each added a goal to help solidify the lead.
During the second half of play Harvard allowed Holy Cross to score four times. The Crimson made up for those goals allowed by answering each time the Crusaders got a shot past sophomore goalie Kelly Weis.
Two out of Holy Cross’s four second half goals came on free position shots, with the team converting two of its six opportunities from behind the arc. For Harvard, the team converted five of eight free position opportunities, three of which came from Romeo. The Crimson was perfect on clears, going 12-for-12 in the category as opposed to the Crusaders’ 9-10.
One of the aspects of the game the Harvard has been looking to work on during the past couple of games has been draw controls. Wednesday night’s game showed great improvement in that category, with the team winning 16 of the 24 possible draws, allowing them to keep possession of the ball for the majority of the game. This is the first time in the past three games that the team has had the advantage in possessions and the first time this season that the draw controls won have been in double digits.
The Crimson also outshot Holy Cross 31-18 while forcing the Crusaders to turn the ball over nine times throughout the match. Harvard had the advantage in ground balls as well, recording 10 overall to Holy Cross’s seven. In goal, Weis was able to save seven of the 12 goals that got through Harvard’s defensive line. This season, Weis has played in all 11 games, recording 97 saves so far for a save percentage of 49.7 percent.
The women’s lacrosse team could not be reached for comment.

You’ve made it to Thursday, which means you’re so close to the weekend and Yardfest! In honor of Throwback Thursday, here are some things that happened around this time through the years:
Yesterday in 2004, Felipe’s first opened up on Mt. Auburn Street “despite technical difficulties and unfinished decor.” It received fairly positive first reviews, except for one customer’s critique that “the guacamole is not as good.”
On this day in 1975, a Harvard junior won his second straight Scrabble tournament in Maine. He won “with a total of 2545 points for six games, besting all six opponents that he faced.” Noteworthy moves included “retainer” for 74 points and “cavalier” for 78 points.
Finally, today in 1939, The Crimson posted an article about a junior who may consider joining a traveling circus for his special talent of “goldfish gulping,” which apparently consists of competing to swallow goldfish that are at least 3 inches in length. We don’t really know what to make of this either.
 
IN THE ATMOSPHERE
Today is going to be a high of 60 degrees and sunny, so you can rejoice in the fact that you get to wear your spring and summer clothes for another day! It’ll be fairly windy however, with rain later in the night.

Even the most seasoned Harvard partiers need a break from Mount Auburn Street once in a while. If you’re looking for a new vista this weekend, you’re in luck—just a few miles down the road, MIT is holding its annual Campus Preview Weekend for admitted students, an event chock-full of nerdy delights of epic proportions. If you’d like to take a walk on the geekier side, or at least indulge your curiosity, it’ll be well worth your time to go get down and nerdy as an undercover Harvard student. Here’s your guide to an unconventional—and surprisingly educational—three days at the trade school down the road.
Thursday
12:17pm: Dumpling Hylomorphisms
For the uninitiated, “hylomorphism” is the building up and consumption of a structure, in this case a dumpling.  At any other school, people would call this making and eating dumplings. But hey, at least we know these dumplings will be well-engineered.
3:29pm: Speed Friending
Making friends with other prefrosh can be awkward, especially if your new acquaintances spent their high school years building nuclear reactors in their basements rather than attending social gatherings. Never fear, as this event will help you make instant superficial friends with whom you can spend the weekend running around campus and wearing MIT lanyards.
6pm: Tiny Crossbows + Circuit Face Painting
Irritating enemies and siblings alike has never been easier, now that you can attend this event and learn to construct “tiny pocket-sized crossbows that shoot toothpicks.” This invention also doubles as a distraction tool in lecture, where you can surreptitiously shoot toothpicks at your professor’s back to the amusement of all around you. And don’t miss the opportunity to “become .002% cyborg” with “electronic face painting.” Make sure those photos go on Facebook.
10pm: PowerPoint Karaoke
Forget karaoke at the Cambridge Queen’s Head! Instead of testing just how tone-deaf you are, this game will grill you on your skills at BS-ing your way through school presentations. The concept, according to the organizers, is to “think on your feet as you give a presentation you’ve never seen before.” Prep for your days giving business presentations on Wall Street and hope the slide text isn’t in Comic Sans.
11:59pm: Sporcle Party
In what might be the most adorable/wholesome/nerdy event of the weekend, gather with your fellow techies to take quizzes on Sporcle, the “awesome quiz website with random quizzes about everything.” Quizzes range from pop culture to geography to naming all the elements on the periodic table, but take three guesses which category your new classmates are likely to excel at.
Friday
2am: FIREHOSE: Algebraic Topology
The only thing better than 2am algebraic topology is drunk 2am algebraic topology. Unfortunately, since this is prefrosh weekend, that won’t be happening. Nevertheless, you’ll want to show up so you can finally find out why “a topologist is someone who can't tell the difference between a doughnut and a coffee cup.” Don’t ask us, we go to a liberal arts school.
12:59pm: Silly String Lava War III: The Reckoning
After dreaming sweet dreams of n-dimensional eigenspaces, wake up and arm yourself with silly string for an epic battle. According to the organizers, “Your mission: Survive. You're a prefrosh on the edge that doesn't play by the rules, except ours...we have bubble wrap.” Thank God for nerds.
2:17pm: Deep-Fried Liquid Nitrogen Ice Cream
This is MIT, so obviously the obligatory pre-frosh liquid nitrogen ice cream party trope must be taken to its furthest extent. “What happens when you subject ice cream to a 400K temperature gradient?” Do it for science!
3pm: Miracle Berries
Yet another wonder of science, synsepalum dulcificum (also known as the miracle fruit) contains the chemical miraculin, which causes sour foods to taste sweet. Go to this event, taste limes, grapefruit, hot sauce, and mustard, and be amazed, because… well.... SCIENCE.
4:47pm: Nerf Chess
Yes, you guessed it. This event is chess with nerf guns. How could this possibly go wrong?
9:59pm: CAFFEINE, CAFFEINE, CAFFEINE, CAFFEINE!
Your guess is as good as mine.
10pm: DKE Black Lights and Lasers Party
With all of the topology and pocket protectors and hackathons, it’s possible to forget that MIT is a real school with real jocks who belong to real fraternities that throw parties. But it’s true. And they’ve got lasers.
Saturday
1:30pm Giant Snickers Bar
It’s true that after eating this giant candy bar, you’ll have to detox with kale juice for twenty-four hours. But then again, YOLO.
3pm: Python Bee
A weekend at MIT would truly not be complete without a joust of coding skills. Be prepared for the person sitting to your left to wipe the floor with you as they rattle off the perfect syntax for list after function after dictionary ad infinitum. Don’t feel bad; they probably sold their latest app to Google for a couple million. On second thought, MIT could afford to make the competition a little thicker by holding it in Objective C.
3pm: Professor Talent Show
If coding is not your thing (if it isn’t, you might want to reconsider your school choice), you could always go to watch a Nobel Prize winner play the recorder. Why don’t we have an event like this at Harvard? Mankiw doing an Irish jig, anyone?
8pm: Really Bad Movie Trailers
“Featuring such gems as Piranhaconda, Sharknado, and the entire Mega Shark series, come see some of the most entertainingly terrible trailers of all time.” This is adorable.
10pm: Top of the Sponge
Before you return home to your non-MIT high school buddies (or take the T home to your Harvard dorm), this is your last chance to get turnt. The “Sponge”—also known as the Simmons dorm, whose modern architecture vaguely resembles a deconstructed SpongeBob—will feature a party on an “iconic outdoor terrace with a view of the Cambridge and Boston skylines.” It’s time to get sweaty with your future classmates, before you realize next year that this sort of thing gets a lot less awkward with alcohol. For now though, soak up the light shows and free glow sticks, and live it up.

Who knew? Fidel Castro used to be smokin' hot.
Back in April 1959, Castro visited Harvard and just like pre-frosh after Visitas, he decided not to stay.
The administration feared that Castro might take shots (not the fun kind) and cracked (not the fun kind) down on security. Police worried that potential assassins might conceal themselves in the bleachers of the Athletic stadium. Someone should have told them that Harvard students don’t attend sports events.
To show his support, President Pusey left campus and was absent for Castro’s speech. Probably for the better as Castro had a habit of overthrowing presidents. 
Castro passed on Ivy League prep and stuck with his army fatigues. You know what they say: dress well, test well. 
 
8-POINT-SOMETHING-SOMETHING: According to the Washington Post, out of the 253,472 applications received by the eight Ivy League schools for the Class of 2018, just 22,624 were actually accepted. That makes the admissions rate an incredibly low 8.92 percent. Crazy, huh?
 
WHAT’S THE VERDICT?: The state of Michigan is anxiously awaiting the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision on whether or not to uphold its voter-approved ban on affirmative action in public university admissions. This has, of course, caused a lot of controversy, but a verdict is expected any day now—stay tuned!
8 FOR 8: A potential Class of 2018’er from Long Island, New York has been all over the news this week for achieving the seemingly impossible: acceptance to all eight Ivy League Universities. 17-year-old Kwasi Enin has stated that his current preference is Yale, but here’s hoping he’ll start seeing the Veritas sometime soon. Congratulations, Kwasi, on your huge accomplishment!
 
STATUS QUO: A recent article released by the Huffington Post suggests that posting your college news in a facebook status, while seemingly a harmless way to share the news, may actually cause more stress and anxiety than you bargained for. Since everyone finds out at different times, and some news may not be so great, this can make for hurtful comparisons between students. Future seniors, avoid posting about every college that accepts you—save it the one or two that matter most.
 
HONEST ABE: If your admissions decisions have got you down, just be glad you aren’t former president Abraham Lincoln’s son Robert Todd—he was all set to go to Harvard in 1859 until he failed his entrance exam and had to return to school to improve his academics before he got in. Word on the street is his dad wasn’t too happy about it.
