After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 7, 2013, at 9:12 p.m.
Pieter Lehrer, associate head coach at the University of California, Berkeley, was named the new coach of the Harvard’s men’s soccer team on Thursday.
Lehrer’s hiring comes three months after the resignation of Carl Junot, who led the team for the past three seasons.
Lehrer will start his new position next week, when he will travel to Cambridge to begin instructing players during offseason workouts, according to Director of Athletics Robert L. Scalise. When he arrives at Harvard, Lehrer will face the challenge of turning around a team that went 3-11-3 and finished last in the Ivy League with a 0-6-1 conference record in the 2012 season.
“We welcome [Lehrer] to Harvard,” Scalise said. “He was an outstanding candidate...and he impressed us with his ability to motivate his players as well as with his philosophy of using soccer as a way to help educate people.”
Lehrer was selected during an interview process that began during Wintersession and involved both players on the team and interested alumni. Scalise said that during interviews, Lehrer’s ability to communicate his message stood out among the other candidates.
“He is a very clear communicator,” Scalise said. “He states specific goals for both the team and the individual player. He gives everyone a role, from a traveling role to a non-traveling role to a starter to a key player. He walked us through in the interview process his ideas to get the team to improve. In our environment with our type of students, that type of mindset is very important.”
Reached by phone on Sunday, Lehrer said that Harvard student-athletes have built-in advantages that are conducive to athletic success.
“[This group] had to do well academically to get to Harvard, and they had to compete in all arenas in their life,” Lehrer said. “If we give them a good place to go to and show them how to be successful on and off the field, I think they will respond to it.”
Although the team regressed during Junot’s tenure—after winning the league in 2009, the team never finished higher than sixth in the Ancient Eight under the former coach—Lehrer said he believes the team has potential.
“You look at the basketball program and the excitement and the success that they have had, [and] I think it can be very similar [for the soccer team],” Lehrer said. “Every person in the world, every kid in the world who has had success academically or as a soccer player will be interested in Harvard.”
As a player, Lehrer helped the University of California, Los Angeles, soccer team to its first-ever NCAA championship in 1985. After graduating from UCLA in 1990, he later worked as an assistant coach for both Stanford and the Los Angeles Galaxy before joining the Golden Bears.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s volleyball (14-8, 7-4 EIVA) clinched a spot in the EIVA Playoffs this weekend, splitting its two home games against Princeton (10-8, 8-4) and George Mason (14-3, 10-3).
Against the Tigers on Friday evening, the Crimson extended its home winning streak to 12 games in a dramatic match, winning 15-13 in the fifth set.
However, that win streak ended Saturday afternoon against the Patriots. Although Harvard jumped out in front winning the first set and subsequently had chances in the next three sets, George Mason ultimately prevailed, 3-1.
All three teams will be going to the playoffs in the next few weeks and lie behind powerhouse Penn State in the standings.
In both games the difference came down to the momentum-shifting points. While the Crimson was able to get the upper hand in that department on Friday, the team was on the receiving end of some impressive Patriot plays down the stretch on Saturday.
Captain Nick Madden led Harvard with 27 kills over the weekend in addition to 13 digs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A comeback stopped short in the final inning of the first game fueled the Harvard softball team’s domination in its second contest of the day.
The Crimson (11-17, 4-4 Ivy) split Friday afternoon’s double-header against Princeton at Soldiers Field but outscored the Tigers (17-9, 3-1), 12-7.
“The second game we had better at bats,” Crimson coach Jenny Allard said. “The first game they were trying too hard and over-swinging. They just did a better job believing in themselves and staying with the process of hitting.”
Exemplifying Harvard’s turnaround at the plate was junior third baseman Kasey Lange, who leads the team with a .684 slugging percentage. In the first game, Lange grounded out to short with a runner on second to end the third inning and flied out to left with the bases loaded in the seventh.
But in the second game, Lange came up big with a bases-clearing double that sparked her team’s six-run fourth.
Picking up a win against the Tigers, who entered the Ivy League season with the best non-conference record and currently sit in second place in the South Division, was an opportunity for the Crimson to remain in contention.
“We know that Ivies is a dogfight this year and it’s anyone’s game,” Lange said.
HARVARD 11, PRINCETON 3
After falling behind in the first game, Harvard jumped out to an early lead with a run in the bottom of the first and scored in four of the five innings before the mercy rule was called to end the contest.
Freshman Jamie Halula pitched a complete game and improved her record to 3-4, holding Princeton scoreless for the first three innings.
In the bottom of the third, junior captain and right fielder Shelbi Olson drew a leadoff walk and advanced to second on a Lange single up the middle. Sophomore shortstop Emily Gusse drove both of them in with a double up the gap that knocked out Princeton’s starting pitcher, senior Liza Kuhn. Gusse advanced to third on a wild pitch and was brought home on a groundout to short.
A leadoff double by Tigers’ senior centerfielder Lizzy Pierce sparked a two run fourth inning for Princeton. Halula struggled with her control, walking the next batter and allowing her to advance to second on a wild pitch. With no outs, senior right fielder Candy Button slapped a double to centerfield and scored two.
But the rally would not last, and Lange helped the Crimson score six in its half of the inning. After Lange’s double, four singles—including three consecutive—plated the final three runs of the inning for Harvard.
The Tigers came back with a run in the fifth, but Harvard added one of its own to activate the mercy rule.
Halula said that the loss in the first game helped the Crimson focus on adjusting and executing, as well as providing motivation.
“We kind of realized that the worst thing we could do was lose, and we already did that,” Halula said.
PRINCETON 4, HARVARD 1
Although Harvard had plenty of opportunities to score, the team couldn’t string together the hits it needed to overcome the run deficit.
Freshman Morgan Groom and her Princeton counterpart, senior Alex Peyton, both pitched three shutout innings to open the game, but the Tigers put themselves on the board in the fourth with a small ball showing that included an error by Gusse, two bunts, and a single.
After pitching a three-up-three-down fourth, Peyton doubled to open the fifth and her pinch runner added Princeton’s third run of the game.
The Crimson opened the sixth with back-to-back doubles to plate its only run of the game, but despite loading the bases on a single by sophomore second baseman Katherine Lantz and a one-out walk by Gusse, Harvard could not come up with another hit.
“We were swinging early, we were on our front feet, were pulling our heads, all the things hitters do when they’re pressing and trying too hard,” Allard said.
After sophomore Gabrielle Ruiz allowed a fourth run in the top of the seventh, the Crimson had a number of chances in its half but again could not convert. With one out and runners on first and second, Olson hit a slow, playable roller to short, but the Tigers’ freshman first baseman Kayla Bose could not keep her foot on the bag.
With the bases loaded, Lantz scorched a liner up the middle, but Peyton knocked it down and threw her out at first to end the ballgame.

Remember Visitas? That magical weekend when you acquainted yourself with your potential new home and met your fellow brilliant overachievers was not so long ago. As future members of the Class of 2017 prepare to come to campus sooner than you can say "advising fortnight," take a few minutes to walk down memory lane with us.
By the way, for all you prefrosh out there: Hey there, future members of the Class of 2017! Welcome to Flyby. We've put together a little classification of the types of the characters you are likely to meet. See if you can spot these various species throughout the weekend.
The Chronically Undecided
These prefrosh are still "unsure" if they will matriculate to Harvard and they will make sure everyone knows it. Everyone they meet will give them great reasons to come here, but these will always fall short. Typical phrases falling from their lips include: "Living in New Haven can’t be that bad, can it?"; "The only reason I'm still actually considering Stanford is the weather"; and "Though Harvard is great, the aerospace engineering program at MIT is really in a league of its own."
The Facebook People
They will find you, they will ask you your name and where you are from, and 30 minutes later you will get a friend request from them. Don't feel too special though because this has happened to every single prefrosh. Enjoy those random prom pictures on your newsfeed of the kid you spoke to for approximately three minutes before the faculty panel!
The Super Facebook People
A slight variant from the aforementioned species, this type of prefrosh is more rare, and can be tricky to observe in its natural habitat. You will never actually meet this person, but they will send you and every other member of the Harvard Class of 2017 Facebook group a friend request. A cult of personality of sorts will develop around these people, as every member of your class knows numerous intimate details about their lives—but good luck trying to find them in the flesh.
The Overeager
Easy to spot, hard to avoid—these prefrosh seem to be omnipresent. While this group may be small in numbers, they make up for this deficiency by attending every single event listed on the schedule in their crimson-colored folders. We at Flyby speculate that they may actually have time turners, so they can attend the overlapping A Cappella groups' barbeque and Harvard Democrats intro meeting. When you first meet these prefrosh, the sheer number of questions that spew out of them can be intimidating, but do not be alarmed—they mean well.
The Faux Frat Crowd
The first thing to notice about these prefrosh is how quickly they find each other. Drawn by their mutual desire for beer pong, bad decisions, and crazy morning-after stories, expect these high school party veterans (or wannabe veterans) to be wandering Canaday courtyard together the first night looking for some "action." Lost without the familiar environs provided by suburban house parties, these prefrosh will probably just end up pregaming the Prefrosh Palooza. There's nothing crazier than listening to the Kroks a little tipsy! They excel at making up stories to tell their friends back home, though.
The Pseudo BFF
This type of prefrosh seems so tame—all he wants to do is become your new best friend!—but beware of the awkwardness that can ensue. Yes, you like all of the same bands and are both trying to choose between Social Studies and Social Anthropology, but a month from now someone will stop texting back. No big deal, right? WRONG. As it turns out, you end up in the same freshman seminar and you can't quite remember her name. Welcome to three and a half months of forced "Hey! How are you!" greetings. In rare, cases, however, this friendship actually endures, and you will have made a best friend for life. It's all the same over prefrosh weekent though—whether it will ultimately last for life or for a week, the intensity of this new friendship is palpable throughout. You might want to consider friendship bracelets.
Sound familiar? For all those who are now nostalgic for the good (and slightly awkward times) of the days when Veritaffles seemed like the coolest things ever, you can sign up to host prefrosh through Monday, April 8, at 12 p.m.
And prefrosh—get ready for a memorable few days. Whatever happens, never forget that New Haven is that bad.
