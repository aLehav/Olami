After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 14, 2015, at 2:54 a.m.
NEW HAVEN, Conn.—Prior to Friday, the last time the Harvard men’s ice hockey team left the Whale with a victory, junior forward Jimmy Vesey was 11 years old. After picking up a 5-3 road win over Yale in 2005, the Crimson had traveled to Ingalls Rink 12 times since, only to come up short on each trip.
Vesey had been on the ice for five of those 12 losses—part of his 0-9-1 career record against the Bulldogs. But with one swing of his stick on Friday night, both losing streaks came to an end.
With the score even at two in the waning moments of Game 1 of the ECAC quarterfinals, Harvard found the answer it had been seeking for over a decade with 2:26 remaining. After picking the pocket of Yale junior defenseman Rob O’Gara, sophomore forward Alex Kerfoot fed Vesey on a two-on-one, and the Nashville Predators prospect delivered what he later called “the favorite goal of [his] college career” to lift the No. 18/- Crimson (18-11-3, 11-8-3 ECAC) to a 3-2 win.
“Kerfoot made a great pass,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “And there aren’t a lot of guys I’d rather have than Vesey alone in the slot.”
Less than a week after Vesey became the first member of the Crimson to reach 50 points in a single season in 12 years, the junior reached the 50-goal plateau for his career with the game-winner. He is tied for first in the country with 26 goals on the year.
Following the goal, the Harvard defense, sparked by the return of fourth-year defenseman Patrick McNally to the lineup, held the No. 12/12 Bulldogs (17-8-5, 12-6-4) off the board to secure the victory. After missing the last 14 games with a leg injury, McNally reclaimed his spot on the top pairing with junior Desmond Bergin Friday, sealing the game with one final clear in the closing seconds.
“[McNally] still kind of looks like his old self out there carrying the puck and making great decisions...and jumping into the rush,” Vesey said. “He’s another guy we’re happy to have back.”
Kerfoot, who went down with an injury in Game 1 of the Crimson’s opening round series with Brown, also made a difference in his return, scoring Harvard’s second goal of the night in addition to his assist on Vesey’s winner.
“[Kerfoot] gutted it out tonight and obviously made some big plays for us,” Donato said. “It’s been a long time since we’ve had this many guys in the lineup, so I do think it should help us to be able to keep a little bit more energy from period to period and hopefully from night to night.”
After jumping out to a 2-0 lead behind second-period goals from sophomore forwards Sean Malone and Kerfoot, the Crimson eventually watched its lead slip away.
Despite holding Yale to just five shots in the second frame, Harvard saw the Bulldogs begin their rally with under a minute remaining in the period. With fourth-year goaltender Steve Michalek sprawled across the ice after making his fourth save of the stanza, the puck skipped out in front of the net to Yale junior forward Cody Learned, who lifted the puck over Michalek to cut Yale’s deficit in half prior to the intermission.
Learned’s goal boosted the Bulldogs, who needed less than two minutes out of the second break to erase the gap entirely. Winding up from the left circle on a power play, freshman forward Nate Repensky found the netting to even the score and ignite the Ingalls crowd.
But Yale would be unable to come up with another, as the Crimson first line took control in the game’s final minutes, putting a third goal past Bulldog sophomore netminder Alex Lyon for the first time in nine tries. Entering Friday, Lyon had allowed just two goals in three games against Harvard this season as part of his 7-0-1 career record against the Crimson.
“After the second period, our line talked, and we all agreed we could be a lot better,” Vesey said. “Luckily we got the goal in the third period.”
After a scoreless first in which Harvard failed to convert on a handful of scoring opportunities, Malone put Harvard on the board 1:12 into the second period. Coming away with a steal in the neutral zone and darting up the center of the ice, the sophomore lifted a shot over the shoulder of Lyon to give his side its first lead of the season over the Bulldogs.
The lead doubled two minutes later when the Crimson defense caught Yale in the middle of a line change. Vesey received a cross-ice pass at the attacking blue line, where he dropped off a pass to junior forward Kyle Criscuolo behind him. In turn, the co-captain delivered a pass through the crease to the remaining member of the Harvard first line, Kerfoot, who hammered the puck into the back of the net.
Having risen to 15th in the Pairwise rankings with the win, the Crimson will play the Bulldogs again on Saturday in Game 2 of the best-of-three series, which Harvard now leads, 1-0.
“[The win] feels pretty good, but obviously we know that it doesn’t mean much unless we can get a second win,” Donato said. “We’ll take a deep breath, see what we need to improve upon, and come back tomorrow night.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW HAVEN, Conn.—Jimmy Vesey entered Game 1 of the ECAC tournament quarterfinals with 49 career collegiate goals. When all is said and done at Harvard for the Ivy League Player of the Year, his 50th might go down as his most important.
With under two-and-a-half minutes left at Ingalls Rink on Friday, Vesey saw an opening on the right wing as sophomore linemate Alex Kerfoot muscled the puck away from Yale junior defenseman Rob O’Gara along the opposite boards. As Vesey sprinted up the slot, he found the puck on his stick a little earlier than he expected. He let his scoring instinct take over from there.
Saturday and, if necessary, Sunday will decide the ultimate meaning of Vesey’s 50th scoring play—a beaming one-timer past the left glove of sophomore goaltender Alex Lyon. But for now, the No. 18/- Crimson men’s ice hockey team (18-11-3, 11-8-3 ECAC) can appreciate its 3-2 performance on Friday as a special win—one marked by surprise returns and broken streaks.
McNAILED IT
Last weekend, questions surrounded the health of Harvard’s best defenseman and first-line center. On Saturday, Patrick McNally and Kerfoot provided emphatic answers in their returns.
The most surprising addition to the lineup was McNally. After injuring his right knee at Cornell on Jan. 23, the fourth-year blue liner had ruled out the possibility of returning during the regular season yet held out hope that a successful rehabilitation would allow him to return in a late postseason round.
McNally, who leads all Crimson defensemen in goals, assists, and points despite playing in only 16 games this year, returned to non-contact skates two weeks ago and participated in his first full-contact practice on Wednesday. On Saturday, McNally reunited with junior defensive pair Desmond Bergin to provide an immediate impact on the Crimson back line.
Although perhaps a step slower on the back check than usual, McNally picked up where he left off in his stickhandling, passing, and forechecking game, and he gained strength as the night progressed. With No. 12/12 Yale (17-8-5, 12-6-4) threatening to score with an extra attacker in the final seconds, McNally cleared the puck from behind the Crimson net to Vesey to help clinch the game.
“[McNally’s] stick seems like it’s 20 feet long sometimes,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “He made, I thought, some real poised plays at the end to get us out of there with a win.”
Kerfoot, similarly, made a surprise impact after suffering a right upper body injury last week in Game 1 against Brown.
Despite being a game day decision on Friday, the sophomore finished with a goal and a game-winning primary assist. At the top of the crease, the New Jersey Devils draft pick stuffed in a feed from junior co-captain Kyle Criscuolo to give Harvard a 2-0 lead at 3:55 in the second period.
After Yale’s Nate Repensky tied the game following a holding penalty to Kerfoot early in the third period, the British Columbia standout sparked Harvard’s most important play of the season.
“[Kerfoot is] obviously a big part of our team and really is a difference-maker out there,” Vesey said. “He’s really dynamic, especially with the puck on his stick, so it was big to get him back.”
IN THE BELLY OF THE WHALE
On Sunday, Vesey needed a haircut.
After Harvard beat Brown last weekend, the North Reading, Mass. resident turned to a hometown friend for help with a bold do—something that would “spice things up in the locker room.”
Vesey’s newest look—a slightly fuzzy Harvard “H” shield stenciled into the back of his head—might not be the finest piece of hair artistry, but it got the job done on a day in which his teammates needed a spark as they played against history.
The Crimson’s win on Friday was the program’s first against Yale since the 2012 ECAC tournament, and its first at Ingalls Rink since January 2005. Only four dressed Harvard players—McNally, goaltender Steve Michalek, forward Colin Blackwell, and co-captain defenseman Max Everson—had played in wins against the Bulldogs prior to Friday.
“This year, we knew we had a better team,” Vesey said. “Sometimes, I think it’s just a psychological thing when we come out and don’t play our best, but tonight I thought we had a really good team effort. Every guy on the team worked hard, and it was great to come out on top.”
