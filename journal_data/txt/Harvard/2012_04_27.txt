After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This week, Harvard University Health Services announced tentative plans to close Stillman Infirmary between 11 p.m. and 8 a.m. this summer. If carried out, the closure would go into effect June 4 and last until August 12, during which time students seeking medical treatment at night would need to go to Mount Auburn Hospital, or another emergency room. All indications are that Stillman Infirmary has not received heavy traffic during these hours in previous summers, but there is nevertheless much cause for concern with regard to Stillman’s reduced hours. While it is true that the Mount Auburn Hospital emergency room will continue to operate 24 hours a day, the absence of any University-affiliated healthcare center at night undoubtedly poses a sizeable psychological barrier to students in need of medical treatment. As a community, we hope that all students who consider their safety to be at risk—especially due to excessive alcohol consumption—seek appropriate medical attention. We fear that students on the fence about seeking treatment for alcohol-related illness may be disinclined to do so if it would require an ambulance ride to Mount Auburn as opposed to a short walk to University Health Services.
Even if quality care is available at non-University-affiliated locations, it is unlikely that students will be as inclined to take advantage of it. While the psychological obstacle of leaving the Harvard community to seek treatment for alcohol-related illness is itself large, it is further exacerbated by the financial cost of the ambulance ride to Mount Auburn. While Stillman Infirmary is within a five minute walk from most student housing—accessible, with help, to even the severely inebriated—any nighttime trek to Mount Auburn will almost certainly need to be in an ambulance. The cost of an ambulance ride, even a short distance down Memorial Drive, can easily top  $1,000, posing another disincentive to students on the fence about seeking treatment.
Since Stillman’s nighttime staff is quite small, shutting down the infirmary for 9 hours a night for 2 months, the University is not poised to be saving huge sums of money—at least, not enough money to warrant the added safety risk to students on campus. The emotional cost to the community of an alcohol-related tragedy resulting from a student’s reluctance to seek care at Mount Auburn would far outweigh any pecuniary benefits Harvard stands to gain from shutting down Stillman. Even if such an event is unlikely, Harvard should avoid at all costs doing anything that could increase its probability.
In the past, UHS has not received stellar marks in student satisfaction, and has recently been accused of negligence. While the outcome of the latter accusation is yet undecided, the decision to close Stillman at night during summer months will certainly not improve UHS’s standing with the student population. It is a reasurring feeling to know that medical care is available at UHS whenever we need it, just a short walk away. At the very least, students living on campus this summer will have to go without that sense of security, likely facing a higher risk of alcohol-related harm in the process.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is a war being waged against the women of this country. Over the past few months, women have been compared to animals left and right, called prostitutes and sluts on national media, and have faced serious attacks on our reproductive freedoms. Amendments imposing severe restrictions on a woman’s right to choose have been introduced in many state legislatures, and there have been national debates about access to contraception. Our bodies have become battlefields, and it’s high time that we stand up and fight.
The United States has never been particularly progressive on women’s issues. The Equal Rights Amendment was successfully blocked in the 1970s, and as a result there is currently no constitutional guarantee that women receive the same rights as men. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, a document that essentially serves as an international bill of rights for women, has been ratified by 185 countries. The only countries that have not yet ratified the convention are seven mostly conservative, developing countries and—you guessed it—the U.S.
However, while we do not have a comprehensive groundwork for women’s rights in the U.S., we have, at least, made some gains over the past few decades. Eisenstadt v. Baird in 1972 ensured the right of women to use birth control in any situation and, in 1973, Roe v. Wade ensured that women could receive legal and safe abortions.
Unfortunately, our country is now attempting to revoke many of the gains that our foremothers made in the second wave of the feminist movement during the 1970s. The so-called Personhood Amendments that are appearing in the legislatures of many states would severely restrict women’s access to abortion, often even in life-threatening cases and in cases in which the fetus is dead or has no chance of surviving. There have even been attempts to legally redefine “rape” so that it would be harder for rape victims to prosecute rapists. There have also been attempts to cut funding to Planned Parenthood, the main source of reproductive health resources for the women in the U.S.
Furthermore, these attacks have been carried out largely without any input from women. A relatively recent congressional hearing on insurance coverage of contraceptives did not allow a single person who would ever have to worry about an unplanned pregnancy (read: who was female) to serve on the panel. And when there was a hearing scheduled afterwards for a female graduate student, Sandra Fluke, to be allowed to give her voice on the issue, she was called a prostitute on a national radio show.
All of these actions serve as examples of a majority group making decisions for a minority group, a situation that seems to occur all too often in our country. White males are grossly overrepresented in all levels of our government and thus all too often make decisions for groups of people whom they cannot accurately speak for. However, this war is not being waged against women by men in general or by the government as a whole. It is being waged by a very specific group of conservative, mostly male politicians who think that their religion gives them the right to make decisions about my body.
However, after months of this barrage of acts against us, some movement is finally taking place. Tomorrow, women and their allies will gather in cities across the country, Boston included, rallying and letting the government know that these attacks on our self-respect, our bodies, and our rights will not stand. But once these rallies are over, it does not mean that we are finished. We will still need to call and write to our Congressmen and women and educate others about what is happening. It is impossible for people to rally against injustice if they do not know about it or understand it, so we must spread the word and get people motivated to fight for their rights.
As women, most of us are taught throughout our lives to be highly considerate of the opinions of other people. We are trained to respect the decisions and thoughts of others, especially those of men, regardless of what those opinions are. But there sometimes comes a point when what the other side has to say is violent and offensive and wrong, period. When there’s no room for debate because you are not on equal footing with the opposing party, as they are in a position to do things to you that you can’t protest or fight through traditional legal means. This point has come, and it is up to us to make sure that their actions do not stand. So let’s band together, make some noise, and refuse, in no uncertain terms, to be politely angry.

It’s time to talk about Iran. The last few months have seen an unprecedented increase in belligerent rhetoric of American and Israeli neoconservatives towards Iran, with calls for a pre-emptive strike on the Islamic Republic becoming more numerous by the day. These calls are generally predicated on claims that Iran is attempting to develop nuclear weapons and are often coupled with caricatured representations of the country as a backwards evil empire populated exclusively by aggressive, messianic clerics and enslaved women.
The reality is quite different. Iran is a complicated place, a frequently repressive Islamic Republic that uniquely combines religious nationalist modernity and a theocratic form of democracy. Within this political landscape, civil society and various social actors frequently contest power and authority in big and small ways, redefining the limits of acceptable dissent and interpreting religious laws in ways conducive to progressive social change.
The Islamic Republic’s “enslaved women,” meanwhile, are anything but. Today, more than 60 percent of Iranian university graduates are women, and while many laws instituted since the Revolution regarding women’s rights are retrogressive, campaigns to improve women’s social rights including literacy and pro-birth control and condom usage campaigns have been some of the most successful on Earth.
Despite the great diversity of Iranian public life today, there is one thing that Iranian actors from across the political spectrum agree on wholeheartedly: An American or Israeli attack on Iran would completely stifle this vibrant public sphere. In the face of an aggressive attack, the Iranian government would undoubtedly clamp down, and those who struggle to improve the political situation would shut down, driven by the need to avoid the only situation worse than political repression—the chaos and violence of war.
This fear is not only driven by numerous historical examples of governments under threat cracking down on civil liberties, but also by an understanding of the history of U.S. intervention in Iran and the deeply negative consequences it has had for the Iranian people. So how do Iranians see the role of the U.S. in their country’s recent history?
Most Iranians identify 1953 as the key moment in their relationship with the United States. In this year, the Central Intelligence Agency overthrew their democratically elected Prime Minister, Mohammed Mossadegh, and reinstated the Shah of Iran, a brutal autocrat who ruled with U.S. support until a popular revolution in 1979. By 1980, however, Iraq had invaded Iran and began a brutal eight-year war.
Saddam Hussein had well-documented support from the U.S. during the war, and the U.S. government was aware of his use of chemical and biological agents against Iranians. After 27 years of U.S.-backed dictatorship under the Shah, half a million Iranians were killed in a war against a dictator actively encouraged by the U.S. to do “whatever was necessary” to win, in the words of Ronald Reagan.
Since 1979, the U.S. has imposed wide-reaching sanctions on Iran. What were originally military sanctions during the 1980s were altered in the 1990s so that all commercial and financial dealings with the country were criminalized. There are very few instances in modern history where U.S. sanctions have achieved their goals; instead, as elsewhere, they have wreaked massive damage on the Iranian economy, hurting women and the working and middle classes while most members of the regime have found ways to prosper. In the last two months these sanctions have been tightened significantly. For example, the Iranian banking system has been isolated, a fact which in effect criminalizes Iranians in this country who send money home to their families.
The sanctions occur within an increasingly toxic climate of covert warfare being waged against Iran by the U.S. and Israel. Just this month, evidence has emerged that the U.S. and Israel have been aiding and funding terrorist groups active on Iranian soil and have even trained in Nevada one group that the State Department itself officially considers a terrorist group. This is not to mention the series of assassinations over the last few years of Iranian nuclear scientists that U.S. officials have pinned on Israeli-funded terrorist groups on Iranian soil, as well as sources in the U.S. government that have admitted to funding unpopular ethnic separatist groups within Iran to “sow chaos.”
Another decisive marker of American aggression for many Iranians is the fact that the United States has invaded two different countries on Iran’s borders (Afghanistan and Iraq) in the last ten years, igniting a bloody insurgency in the first and a civil war in the other. Americans should imagine what it would be like if Iran had invaded both Canada and Mexico and had its armies stationed on these borders, all the while claiming that the U.S. is a threat to world peace and must be stopped.
In all their enthusiasm to intervene in Iran, Americans must remember the provocative actions this country has been engaged in in the Middle East in the last 60 years and that numerous interventions on the side of dictatorships across the region are well-remembered by others. Attacking Iran would have disastrous consequences for the Iranian people and the quest for greater civil liberties and freedoms. As a statement signed by 200 prominent Iranian women’s rights activists last International Women’s Day reminds us, “War for us, means destructive violence committed against women and children... It signifies the silencing of our demands and civil protest." These are words to remember as the Israeli and American right tries to drag us into another disastrous war.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This week, Foreign Policy magazine published a controversial polemicon women’s rights in the Arab World titled, “Why Do They Hate Us?”Mona Eltahawy, a Muslim Egyptian-American journalist and columnist, scathingly and methodically chronicled the dismal state of women’s rights in the Arab world. She suggests that hatred is the ultimate source of the region’s severe gender inequalities and concludes her piece by calling for a revolution in thought in conjunction with current political upheaval.
The article suffers from significant weaknesses, particularly in its presentation. First, its garish body-paint-niqab photographs may have been successful marketing tools, but they also undermined the substance of the piece. Likewise, the title of the piece is distracting because although Eltahawy demonstrated with overwhelming statistics the state of misogyny in the Arab world, she only half-heartedly explained the sources of that misogyny. Therefore, “They Hate Us” may have been a more appropriate title. Finally, using “hate” throughout the piece, instead of the less emotionally charged “misogyny” or “inequality,” inevitably lead to equally charged responses.
Despite these weaknesses (or perhaps because of them), the article shook gender and Middle Eastern studies circles. Eltahawy exposed and chronicled the Arab world’s misogyny as what it is—deep and pervasive. The responses to the article exposed Arab world studies for what it’s become—esoteric and willfully irrelevant.
I do not have the space here to do the subject true justice, but the critiques of Eltahawy’s article utilized certain stock arguments that demonstrate this point.
First is the “monolith” argument. This argument rests on the accusation that a writer is unfairly categorizing a group of people. The trouble with this argument is that generalizations will always ignore exceptions (hence the “general”), but generalizations are nonetheless a fundamental and unavoidable tool in any intellectual conception of the world. And just as scholarship requires generalization, the “monolith” argument is a polemical tool that can be used in any context as a defensive ploy.
The monolith argument is troublesome for a second reason. Take, for instance, Samia Errazzouki’s “You Do Not Represent ‘Us’,” published in Al-Monitor. She writes, “[…] women in the region certainly are victims of a patriarchal society […] this is not the issue. The issue is framing and presenting women in the region as a monolith and pitting their struggles against the backdrop of an argument which points to ‘hate.’” That’s right, gender inequality is a non-issue next to using the word “they.” This is the true state of studies on the Middle East: Semantics is more important than truth.
The cousin of the “monolith” argument, the “it’s more complicated” argument, is likewise an all-purpose polemical tool in the analyst’s toolbox. This argument runs something like this: Misogyny in the Arab world is a product of particular historical, economic, and social constructs, and furthermore, misogyny’s structures and manifestations differ across the region. Along these lines, Tom Dale, a writer at “openDemocracy,” asserts that, “As an Arab woman herself, el Tahawy [sic] undoubtedly does not intend to essentialise Arab societies.” To the contrary, Eltahawy explicitly states that misogyny in the Arab world should be understood in both a general, international context and as a region-specific phenomenon.
As Eltahawy points out, “Not a single Arab country ranks in the top 100 in the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Report, putting the region as a whole solidly at the planet's rock bottom.”
Both of these sophomoric arguments, the “monolith” and the “it’s more complicated,” are used with Pavlovian consistency to any writing that dares to imply that anything Islamic or Arab can explain injustices in the Arab world. One should be able to acknowledge that Islam and Arab culture are factors in the repression of women in the Arab world. Whether those factors are more or less significant than economic and political factors is, of course, debatable, and sensitivity to Islam and Arab culture may be necessary in certain contexts, but here it stifles meaningful debate.
The fundamental weakness of the critiques is that they intentionally overlook Eltahawy’s main point. They give attention to the “Why?” to avoid confronting the “What?” To my knowledge, none of the major criticisms of Eltahawy’s article even attempted to refute the scope of misogyny in the Arab world.
Meanwhile, in Egypt, recent events underscore the timeliness of Eltahawy’s stand. While the country teeters on the edge of chaos, its parliament discusses the merits of an early marriage law and the“Farewell Intercourse” law.The former would lower the legal age of marriage to fourteen years and the latter would (not kidding) legally enable a man to penetrate his wife up to six hours after her death. Because who says violating women’s rights should stop at death?
Rather than confronting obvious forms of gender-based injustice, most significant thinkers on the Arab world, from both the Middle East and the West, prefer to be apologists mired in muddled understandings of cultural relativism. The steps backward for women’s rights in the Arab World over the last year and a half demonstrate not only the popular base for gender inequality but also that the most recent generations of thinkers on the Arab World have failed to influence that base.Even worse, rather than joining the activists demanding the expansion of women’s rights at this crucial juncture, silence, wrapped in the facade of cultural respect, is the norm.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Christopher A. Hopper ’13 rates his classes in the Q guide based on how they “make him feel.” If a class is painful or makes him sad, he is more likely to give it a low score.
Madeline S. Peskoe ’14 uses the Q guide as a procrastination tool before exams. She is more likely to give a course a good score if the professor was enjoyable—even if she did not learn as much.
And while Christopher Z. F. Husch ’13 spends twenty minutes filling out the Q guide for each of his courses, he said he has no doubt that most students are not nearly as diligent.
Harvard administrators hope the Q Guide can serve as a fair measurement of student course satisfaction and a credible metric for evaluating teaching quality. But faculty and administrators interviewed for this article almost unanimously admit that the reliability of Q scores is questionable at best. Some even argue that what the Q Guide measures—a student’s satisfaction with a particular teacher or course—is completely unrelated to how much he or she actually learns in the course.
“[The scores] are totally worthless,” said former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68. “Everybody knows they’re worthless.”
As the Faculty of Arts and Sciences embarks on a campaign to prioritize undergraduate teaching and place itself at the cutting edge of higher education, it continues to lack a definitive system of assessing the quality of the teaching done by its faculty members.
THE OBJECTIVE
In the fall of 2006, former FAS Dean Jeremy R. Knowles charged nine of the school’s faculty members with examining how FAS could better “support and reward a commitment to the steady improvement of teaching.”
The resulting committee—known as the Task Force for Teaching and Career Development—made almost a dozen recommendations in its eventual report. It called for the development of alternative methods of teacher evaluation and asked that teaching performance be given greater consideration in the decisions ranging from the appointment and promotion of junior faculty members to salary raises for tenured professors.
In the publicly available document, the authors of the report admitted that student evaluations were “at best incomplete and imperfect ways to assess the quality and impact of faculty teaching.”
Over five years after the Task Force filed its report, professors say that teaching has indeed taken on a greater significance in the lives of faculty as an important component in performance reviews, promotion decisions, and salary adjustments. But the Q Guide continues to remain the primary means of assessing teaching quality.
“[The Q Guide] has become something on which the administration relies heavily for promotions, and it’s troublesome,” said Ali Asani, chair of the department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations. “So much emphasis is put on Q scores as a measure of good teaching that I think it ultimately has a negative effect on teaching.”
Ladder faculty, however, are not the only ones who have reason to be concerned about their Q scores.
The Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning rewards, for example, teaching fellows, lecturers, preceptors, and course assistants who receive high Q scores. Nearly 40 percent of the workforce receives some sort of award based on positive student evaluations, according to Bok Center director Terry Aladjem. Teaching fellows who get very low Q scores receive a letter from the Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris and receive additional training from the Bok Center.
‘WORTHLESS’
Despite FAS’ reliance on the Q Guide in assessing the quality of teaching in Harvard’s classrooms, many administrators and professors in FAS said that the goals of student evaluations are not in line with the school’s recent and increased commitment to improving the quality of undergraduate pedagogy.
“It’s fairly clear that asking people right at the end of a class, ‘How do you feel about this class,’ doesn’t necessarily answer the questions we are asking: have you learned this well? Has this changed your life?” chemistry department Chair Eric N. Jacobsen said.
In fact, professors said, the current system that students use to rate their instructors and courses falls far short of an objective analysis of teaching quality.
“What if a student is lazy, and the professor goes down on them hard? The student might take out their resentment on the Q Guide,” Asani said.
More significantly, the importance of the Q Guide could skew the way professors approach their teaching.
“For graduate students and junior faculty, for whom these numbers may matter a great deal, it has to unconsciously have an impact on how they grade,” Harris said. “You’re more likely to give someone a 4 or 5, if they’ve given you an A.”
For this reason, some faculty are encouraging a rigorous reevaluation of the system Harvard employs to assess teaching quality—and are questioning the current method, which they said purely evaluates student satisfaction.
“Faculty are just worried about the Q Guide score,” Asani said. “If that becomes the driving force behind teaching, then good teaching has been left behind because then people are teaching to get a better score.”
EVALUATING THE EVALUATION
Finding methods to correlate student evaluations with student learning has yielded abundant scientific literature. But the jury is still out on whether a student’s satisfaction with a course indicates the teacher’s overall effectiveness.
Richard J. Light, a professor at the Graduate School of Education, cited a host of research studies that showed significant correlations between a class’s average test score at the end of the course and the class’s average ratings of the teacher and course overall, suggesting that the Q guide produces some
positive feedback on teaching effectiveness from its polling of s
“The Q Guide is not perfect—it can be improved—but these correlations are nowhere near 0, so it’s worth something,” Light said.
In a separate 2010 paper, researchers found that of students randomly assigned to professors teaching identical calculus courses, those who performed better in the class gave their professors the highest ratings at the end of the semester. But the study also found that higher student ratings were negatively correlated with “deep learning”—the ability to apply material taught in one class to more advanced classes. In other words, the people who rated their classes higher in student satisfaction tended to learn less effectively. In fact, these students sometimes performed less effectively in subsequent classes.
“It’s unknown what precisely [the Q Guide] is measuring,” Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris said.
Further, the scientific community is split on the value of these studies due to the difficulty of designing experimental studies in the complex college environment.
“At the college level, there are tons of courses. It is unclear what learning goals are across different types of courses, and there is whole bunch of self-selection going on,” said sociology professor Christopher Winship.
Indeed, students are rating courses on factors that are not necessarily related to what they have learned. A 2006 memo presented to the Task Force on Teaching and Career Development cited studies that identified over a dozen possible sources of bias in student evaluations—including the course’s grading policy, whether it was an elective, its workload, class size, and a category entitled “instructor expressiveness and showmanship.”
In one well-known example, Nalini Ambady and Robert Rosenthal, two psychology researchers, found that the Q Guide scores of Harvard students who have taken a course for a full semester strongly correlate with scores given by a separate group of Harvard students after watching the course instructor lecture for 30 seconds–with the sound off.
“Students may think they’re really answering the question about whether their homeworks were always returned on time, but they’re really just giving their gut feeling on whether they liked the person or not,” Lewis said.
INNOVATING ON ASSESSMENT
Faculty and administrators said that innovation in teaching and learning must also be accompanied by innovation in methods of assessing teaching.
“It will be important for FAS to stay on the cutting-edge of measures of teaching if, indeed, teaching is going to be a basis for decisions about promotions, tenure, and salary,” sociology professor Mary C. Brinton said.
“The mandatory use of the Q scores as evidence that we’re serious about teaching is not credible,” Lewis said.
Many faculty members suggested peer evaluation between professors, a method used at the Harvard Business School and recently adopted by the life sciences division in FAS, as an alternative system.
“You set out the criteria on which they are going to be evaluated. You tell them this. You observe them in the classroom. You give suggestions. You do it again in a year,” Lewis said.
But Jacobsen, who also mentioned peer evaluation as a potential assessment technique, said that faculty members may not be comfortable with collegial feedback on individual pedagogy. “Faculty are very used to peer review in our research, but we’re much less accustomed to peer review in our teaching,” he said.
Faculty members also questioned whether students should evaluate a course immediately upon its completion.
“What is more interesting, perhaps, is to know how students feel several years after the course,” Jacobsen said.
Currently, there is no system in place for retrospective student evaluation. Although annual senior surveys ask members of the graduating class to name their most positive and negative academic experiences, there are no questions about specific classes or professors.
“We have talked in the General Education Committee about trying to bring together students in four-month or eight-month increments—to bring students from a course back, debrief, and get a feel for [the ongoing quality of learning],” Harris said.
In the meantime, the College strongly encourages course instructors to give mid-term evaluations; the Bok Center offers a template to all instructors. Although Harris denied that the Q Guide itself would be administered mid-semester, he said that personalized evaluations given by instructors partway through a term would provide an opportunity for professors to ask more specific questions.
COMPLETE OVERHAUL?
But according to some faculty members, these small fixes fall short of the larger goal of devising a new and better school-wide system of teaching assessment.
“In many ways, you would need a committee of people who would be willing to invest several years to find out what constitutes best practice,” Winship said. “This is not a situation where we need a little marginal improvement.”
For all its flaws, the Q Guide will probably never be overhauled completely, according to Harris. And some faculty agree that it would be more expensive to make changes than leave it how it is.
“It’s easier just to assume the Q is doing a valid job of evaluating teaching effectiveness,” Winship said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At this time last year, the Harvard men’s volleyball team had finished its season at the bottom of the EIVA standings with no hopes of competing for a championship. The team managed to win its last game, though, and hoped for the best in the coming season.
That victory turned out to be a sign of good things to come. One year later, the No. 15 ranked Crimson (18-5, 10-4) enters the EIVA conference championship as the No. 2 seed. The team will compete for the eleventh EIVA championship and first NCAA bid in program history.
A championship would cap off one of the finest seasons in Harvard history. This marks the first year since 1995 that the team has recorded 18 wins in a season. The Crimson also holds the lowest number of losses in a season since 1993.
The team’s 18 wins mark a career high for head Coach Brian Baise, who was named the EIVA Coach of the Year earlier in the week. Harvard heads to the conference tournament for the second time in his career and the first since 2009.
In addition to Baise’s honors, three members of the team earned All-Conference nods.  Senior outside hitter Matt Jones and freshman outside hitter D.J. White were awarded first team EIVA distinctions, while sophomore setter Rob Lothman earned second team honors.
The honors are well deserved. Jones’s 3.8 kills per game rank second in the conference and tenth in the nation.  His .43 service aces per set also sit at tenth in the nation and fourth in the conference
White is fifth in the conference and 14th in the nation in hitting percentage, of which he has averaged .326 per game.
But according to Baise, the Crimson’s staunch defense has been the story of the year.
“We noticed early on in the year that the teams we were playing were hitting far above their season average when we played them,” Baise said. “So we we’re obviously not doing things that we had to. About halfway through the a season it became clear for us to beat some of the top tier teams and to go out to California and compete, we needed to improve our defense. Part of that has been blocking, part of it is our libero Chris Gibbons, and the back row has worked hard.  And I think those things together have made the difference.”
Harvard will need its strong defensive play on Thursday, when the competition begins at No. 1 Penn State’s home court.  The team will play third-seeded George Mason (12-16, 8-6) in the opening game of the tournament.
The Crimson has split the season series with George Mason.  On Feb. 10, Harvard fell to the Patriots in three straight sets at home at the Malkin Athletic Center.  The team exacted its revenge in March, when it beat George Mason, 3-2, in Manassas, Virginia.
It will take a strong game from the Crimson to get out of the first round.
“We have to have a good serving game,” Baise said. “The first time we played them we didn’t serve as tough as we need to.  Their offense was strong and got real tough to stop. The second time we went down there, we served tough and played better defense, which has gotten better throughout the season. I think to beat them we need to have a good night blocking. We can’t let their hitters have too many easy kills. In addition, we need to be able to handle their serves.”
If the Crimson defeats George Mason on Thursday night, it will move on to Saturday’s championship game. There, Harvard will face the winner of the Penn State (21-5, 14-0) and Princeton (13-9, 7-7) game.
Penn State, the eighth ranked team in the country, is the overwhelming favorite. The Nittany Lions dominated the Crimson on Feb. 17, when they beat Harvard in three straight sets. But the rematch was a different story. After going up two sets in the second time facing Penn State, the Crimson could not close out the match. The Nittany Lions clawed out of its deficit to take the remaining sets and the match.
“We try to take it one game at a time, but I think if we have a game against Penn State, we’re going to be real motivated,” Lothman said. “I think its similar to our California trip last year: we were a little awe stricken and weren’t quite on our game. Then, we came back a year later and we played a lot better. Against Penn State, the first two times, we were a little hesitant and didn’t fully believe in ourselves. But now we’re ready. We’ll get them if we get another shot.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While most Harvard students are preoccupied with acing a final project or exam,  a select group of Crimson football players have their sights set on a different goal, far from the confines of Cambridge and Harvard Stadium: Playing in the NFL. 
In light of the NFL Draft, which runs from April 26-28, we discussed the latest draft news from defensive tackle Josue Ortiz ’11 and senior left tackle Kevin Murphy earlier this week. Now, we examine the prospects of the quarterback who led Harvard to three straight wins over Yale: Quarterback Collier Winters ’11.
Winters had a sterling 2011 campaign. In six contests, the senior went 5-1, threw 13 touchdowns against just 4 interceptions while tallying 1594 yards through the air.
And over the 2011 summer, Winters won the Manning Passing Academy’s “Air It Out” Competition, besting quarterbacks like Stanford’s Andrew Luck, who the Indianapolis Colts will reportedly take with the No. 1 pick in the draft, and Boise State’s Kellen Moore.
But for Winters, an NFL draft pick appears unlikely. On the Crimson’s 2011 roster, the quarterback is listed at 5’11”, a size many consider too small for an NFL quarterback.
“Collier’s probably a little bit of a long shot just because…the height. They really hold it against you,” said Harvard coach Tim Murphy following Saturday’s Spring Game. “Drew Brees is six feet tall, but it gets to a certain extent, they say, ‘He’s a Canadian League guy.’”
Winters acknowledges that his size substantially diminishes his draft prospects.
“There’s a good number of teams—well over half—that aren’t really giving me a shot right now because of my height,” Winters said. “It’s going to take the right team and the right situation for me to get a chance to get into the door, and the height obviously makes that window of opportunity a lot smaller.”
But despite his stature, Winters still has his sights set on the NFL, be it through a draft pick or a free agent contract.
The former Crimson standout signed with agent Michael Giorgio in January. After training in Kansas City following the 2011 season, Winters later came to Boston and took part in the Mar. 21 Boston College Pro Day, in addition to the Harvard Pro Day a week later. Winters believes that both pro days went well.
Leading up to the draft, Winters has received attention from a handful of NFL teams, including the Tennessee Titans, the Atlanta Falcons, and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
“Tampa Bay has been the most interested, and I know their quarterback position has a few openings,” Winters said. “That would probably be the best situation for me, so I’m hoping that works out.”
If Winters goes undrafted, he will attempt to sign as a free agent shortly after and partake in the team’s minicamps.
And if the NFL falls through, Winters will look north to the Canadian Football League.
“A couple [CFL] teams have called expressing interest, but their draft and their signing and everything is after the NFL draft,” Winters said. “So hopefully I’ll hear something from the NFL, but if not, then the CFL would be the next step.”
Whether the NFL comes knocking or not, Winters’ former coach has faith in the quarterback who led the Crimson to three consecutive wins in The Game.
“The thing that Collier had, that was probably as good as any quarterback we’ve had here, including [Ryan] Fitzpatrick [’05]. His accuracy and his quick release were phenomenal,” Murphy said. “If he was 6’3”, he’d be getting drafted.”
“I guarantee this,” Murphy added. “Collier can really play the game. That guy can play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Thursday night’s games approached, the New York Knicks’ destiny was in their own hands. Win against the Charlotte Bobcats, a team regarded as the worst ballclub in NBA history, and Jeremy Lin ’10 and Co. clinch the seventh playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. Lose and be at the mercy of the Philadelphia Sixers, with whom they were tied.
Fortunately for New York, Charlotte played like, well, Charlotte, and Lin’s team was able to coast by with a 104-84 victory. The win insured that it will play the Miami Heat in the first round of the postseason.
Though Miami will be heavily favored, this matchup could prove beneficial for the Knicks.  With Lin out and the point guard position a perennial problem for the squad, playing a Heat team without a strong PG is a definite advantage. If they had lost on Thursday and dropped to the eighth spot, they would have been forced to play reigning-MVP Derrick Rose and the Chicago Bulls—a much tougher matchup for a team lacking in consistent guard play.
If the Knicks manage to get past Miami, hopes are high that Lin will be able to return before the second round. On Wednesday morning, the Harvard alum was spotted doing a dieted version of an NBA workout for the first time since his knee surgery four weeks ago. The workout consisted of jogging, shooting, and a bit of dribbling.
Knicks head coach Mike Woodson voiced his optimism regarding his young star’s comeback.
“He's starting to smell the gym a little bit more now, which is great,” Woodson explained. “I asked him yesterday how he felt after getting out and running a little bit, and he said he felt pretty good. But we've got to put him through drills where he's cutting and things of that nature just to make sure that the knee doesn't swell up and he's not physically sore.”
In terms of a return date, Woodson validated several rumors that had been floating around the NBA blogs.
“I'd like to think if we're able to get out of this first round, he should be ready for the second round,” Woodson said.
For now, though, the Knicks are concentrating their efforts on getting past Miami. If they manage to get by Lebron and Friends, who knows, maybe Linsanity will return in a new, evolved postseason version.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last season, Crimson hurler Rachel Brown fanned 10 batters and allowed seven hits to lead the Harvard softball team to an 8-1 victory over Holy Cross (8-31, 3-13 PL).
This year, Brown has managed to one-up herself, striking out 11 and holding the Crusaders’ offense to just two hits, as the Crimson (29-11, 15-1 Ivy) took down Holy Cross, 10-0, on Thursday. The win marks Harvard’s ninth shutout of the season and the 24th shutout of Brown’s four-year career.
Earlier this week, Brown was named the Harvard COOP Athlete of the Week and earned the title of Ivy League Pitcher of the Week. Brown, who leads the Ancient Eight with an opposing batting average of 1.50 and 206 strikeouts, has already received the latter title four other times this season.
Despite her standout status, Brown credits the entire Crimson defense for its stellar performance in shutting out the Crusaders on Thursday.
“My defense was completely solid behind me,” Brown said. “There were no errors, and Katie Lantz made a great play that took a great amount of range. Kasey [Lange] made a few great plays too, and I couldn’t do any of it without my catchers. Katie Appelbe did a great job blocking pitches in the dirt, because otherwise you run the risk of dropped third strikes and runners on base. I’m just one piece of the puzzle.”
The ten runs plated in by the Crimson offense also came as the result of a team effort, with eight players contributing at least one hit to the squad’s grand total of 15. Senior shortstop Jane Alexander and sophomore third baseman Kasey Lange finished the contest with four hits each. Combined, the two went 8-for-9.
“Jane was on fire,” Crimson coach Jenny Allard said. “It was great to see her really have a sense of urgency at the plate. We need more people in the lineup doing that. Kasey really bounced back. I thought she had a tough weekend. She worked on some things in practice on Tuesday and today it was great to see her make some adjustments and hit the ball solid. They are two go-to people in the lineup.”
The Harvard lineup began its offensive attack as soon as the game began, with Alexander leading off with a double to center field. A sacrifice bunt hit by junior left fielder Ashley Heritage then advanced Alexander to third, and a Lange single drove her home to earn the Crimson its first run of the game.
The second inning proved scoreless for both teams, as three Harvard batters grounded out and Brown fanned two Holy Cross hitters in the bottom of the inning.
In the top of the third inning, Alexander ripped a solo homerun to extend the Crimson’s lead to 2-0.
The Crusaders were unable to muster a run in the second half of the inning, and neither squad put up runs in the fourth.
Harvard managed to get a rally going in the fifth inning, plating in three runs to make it a 5-0 game.
Alexander provided the first spark, leading off with a double to left center. Heritage followed with a single to first base, advancing Alexander to third. Lange then doubled to right center to knock in Alexander and put Heritage in scoring position.
A throwing error by the Holy Cross infield allowed freshman second baseman Katie Lantz to reach first and Heritage to score, unearned. The final run of the inning came in unearned as well, as Lange crossed home plate on a ground out by sophomore right fielder Shelbi Olson.
Brown blanked the Crusaders in the bottom of the fifth and both teams went scoreless in the sixth inning.
The seventh inning featured the Crimson’s greatest offensive drive of the game, as the team doubled its lead from five runs to ten in its last licks.
Lange was the first player to score, doubling down the right field line and then coming home on junior pinch hitter Jess Ferri’s double to left center. Lantz advanced to first on a fielding error and junior pinch hitter Kassy Shiotani walked to load the bases for freshman first baseman Adrienne Hume. The rookie kept the momentum going, singling to center field to knock in Lantz and Ferri.
The rally continued as freshman center fielder Camilla Gibson singled to right field, plating in Shiotani. Alexander followed with another single to right field and Hume scored, putting Holy Cross at a ten-run deficit. The third out of the inning came as Gibson was thrown out at second, and the contest finished in a 10-0 Harvard victory.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The NCAA tournament does not begin for another two weeks, but for the Harvard men’s lacrosse team, the playoffs start now.
With its back against the wall, the Crimson faces No. 19/20 Yale tomorrow in a must-win regular season finale for the third straight year. A victory in New Haven would advance the Crimson (6-7, 2-3 Ivy) to the four-team Ivy League tournament next weekend; a loss would end Harvard’s season unless Dartmouth (1-4 in conference play) can upset Brown in Providence.
After topping Dartmouth and Brown in its first two conference contests of the year (the latter win giving them the tournament tiebreaker), Harvard has lost three straight Ivy games to Cornell, Penn, and Princeton to put its playoff aspirations in jeopardy.
The Crimson would have the chance to get retribution on either the Big Red or the Tigers next weekend in the Ivy tournament—the winner of which moves on to the NCAAs—but it must top the Bulldogs (8-4, 3-2) to get there first.
“The Harvard-Yale rivalry speaks volumes in itself,” tri-captain Terry White said. “They’re going to come ready to play, so it’s up to us to bring it.”
Doing so against the Bulldogs will be no easy task, as Yale comes in riding a six-game winning streak. But the Bulldogs have not been dominant over that span, as Yale’s previous eight matches have been decided by an average of just 1.4 goals.
Last weekend, the Bulldogs edged then-No. 19 Bryant, 11-10, on a tally by senior attack Matt Gibson with 1.7 seconds left in the second overtime. Gibson, a two-time All-American, paces Yale with 25 goals, 15 assists, and 40 points on the year. Junior Deron Dempster and freshman Conrad Oberbeck have each scored 19 times, while senior Greg Mahony has registered 17 goals and sophomore Brandon Mangan has added 16 as part of the Bulldog’s well-balanced offense.
“They’re very similar to us in that they have a pretty seasoned team, so on the whole, we’re all pretty familiar with the guys we’ll be playing,” White said. “I think we match up pretty well with them.”
Two players, senior Jeff Cohen (45 goals) and sophomore Daniel Eipp (24 goals, 17 assists), have dominated the scoring for Harvard this season. Tri-captain Kevin Vaughan has scored 15 times and leads the Crimson with 19 assists, and freshman Will Walker has registered 13 tallies during his freshman campaign. But Harvard’s attack struggled against the Tigers, scoring just five goals.
“On offense, we really need to move the ball better,” Vaughan said. “We’re too stagnant, we’re taking the first thing we can get instead of the best shot, and we’re not getting long enough possessions, which puts too much pressure on the defense.”
The man the Crimson offense will be looking to improve against will be Yale goalie Jack Meyer. The sophomore earned the starting job in week four and on the year has accumulated a .468 save percentage, which ranks just seventh-best in the Ancient Eight. In net for the Crimson during tomorrow’s must-win game will either be junior Harry Krieger (.519 save percentage) or rookie Jake Gambitsky (.458).
“Whoever ends up in there, I’m sure they’ll be ready to go,” White said. “We feel pretty cownfident with both of them.”
A victory would give Yale its longest winning streak in 22 years and the No. 3 seed next weekend, while a Harvard victory would also net it the third position. In a similar situation last year, the Crimson clinched the third seed behind a dominant Krieger—who made 16 saves—and relegated Yale to the fourth position by topping the Bulldogs, 9-5, at Harvard Stadium.
That performance with its season on the line was a far cry from the previous year, when in another must-win game, the Crimson fell in New Haven, 9-8, denying Harvard a spot in the Ivy tournament and ending its season.
“This year’s game is somewhat reminiscent of our sophomore year,” White said. “We remember the seniors then and how disappointed they were, so that’s given us a little extra boost and a little extra incentive in this game.”
But to avoid the fate of the class of 2010, the Crimson’s current seniors and their teammates will have to play their best game of the season in what otherwise could very likely be the final contest of their collegiate careers.
“We have a ton of potential, talent, and character, but we really just need to put together a complete game and play the level of lacrosse we know we’re capable of,” White said. “It’s going to come down to playing loose and playing confident and believing in our schemes, believing in our systems, just taking it to Yale for the full 60 minutes.... If we can do that, I feel very confident about our chances.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 2 seed Harvard men’s volleyball team entered its first-round match of the EIVA tournament against third-seeded George Mason with the hopes of winning a chance to compete for an NCAA tournament bid.
In its previous season matches against the Patriots, the Crimson (18-6, 10-4 EIVA) was 1-1, dropping the first game at home but coming back to win on George Mason’s own court. But Harvard was unable to tip the matchup in its favor, dropping the game, 3-0, to the Patriots (13-16, 8-6 EIVA).
Thursday night at the Recreation Building in University Park, Pa. left the Crimson with flashbacks of its first matchup against George Mason, which it lost, 3-0. Passing and momentum were the main problems that Harvard faced in both match ups.
“They were similar matches,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said. “They received our serve really well in both matches, and we didn’t receive theirs as well. They really had a rhythm going and we didn’t.”
With a No. 15 ranking in the American Volleyball Coaches Association, the Crimson entered the tournament after having received numerous honors. Coach Baise was named EIVA Coach of the Year. Senior outside hitter Matt Jones and freshman outside hitter DJ White were named to the EIVA all conference first team, and junior setter Rob Lothman was given EIVA All-Conference honors and named to the second team.
But all of these accolades recognizing Harvard’s best season in decades were not enough to serve as a rallying point. The Crimson was out-hit by the Patriots in the first two frames, even with Jones notching 14 kills. He was followed by sophomore opposite hitter Nick Madden, who finished with 11 hits of his own.
“They got a lot more swings on the ball,” Madden said. “We were giving them too many chances to get kills, and we weren’t getting enough stops.”
The biggest chance for turning the tide of the game in favor of Harvard came in the third frame, after it was already down two games to none. A pair of Crimson errors in attacking and serving brought the score to 11-5. But Madden provided a key slam that was succeeded by two kills from White.
“I think that if we would have brought the same fire that we had in the third game in the first [two games], we would have won today.” Madden said.
This fire was set by a key kill from Jones that brought the score to 21-17. The senior continued the surge in momentum continued with another crosscourt slam, followed by a block by himself and sophomore opposite hitter Michael Owen.
The Crimson came within one point of George Mason with a service ace from Jones that caused a Patriot timeout. Madden answered for Harvard with a kill, causing George Mason to call for another break in the game.
Jones gave the Patriots a 24-22 advantage with a service error. The Crimson held on for one more block from Owen and Madden. But the pair could not produce a repeat when George Mason’s Andrew Dentler ended the frame and match with a kill, 25-23.
“We started to play a little better at the end of the third game,” Baise said. “We started to get some blocks, and we made some good plays. We got within one at the end, but it was just a little too late.”
The first two frames of the game saw Harvard struggling to find momentum. Three attack errors by Dentler allowed the Crimson to pull within one point around the middle of the first set. Harvard gave a final push at the end of the match with two kills from Jones and blocks from Owen, Jones, and Madden. White and Owen each contributed a hit, but the team was unable to recover and suffered a, 25-19, defeat.
“They had a couple of runs where they’d pull away, and we weren’t able to close the gap,” Madden said. “That’s the thing about George Mason; you can’t let them get up by more than one or two points.”
The second frame had more back-and-forth play. But soon, the Patriots were able to notch a couple of kills and a block that widened the point margin to six. The Crimson remained out of reach of the lead, and fell, 25-19.
“I think if we had a few more weapons on offense, [there] would have been a different result,” White said. “This bodes well for next season though. We’re going to come back healthy and strong.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Entering the final weekend of Ivy League play, just four baseball teams remain in contention for a coveted spot in the Ivy championship series. And for the first time since 2006, one of those slots might belong to Harvard.
The Crimson—which won three of its four contests against Ancient Eight competitor Brown last weekend—currently sits second in the Rolfe Division, just behind its final conference test: Dartmouth.
The Big Green (18-15, 11-5 Ivy) and Harvard (11-27, 7-9) will meet for a home-and-home set of doubleheaders, starting at O’Donnell Field on Saturday and moving north to Hanover, N.H. for the final two games on Sunday.
And the stakes are high. A single win against the Crimson will guarantee Dartmouth a spot in the championship series, as the Big Green currently holds a four-game lead over Harvard thanks in part to an impressive four-game sweep of Yale last weekend.
“For us, it’s do or die,” said senior second baseman Jeff Reynolds. “But we like our chances. We’re capable of beating Dartmouth four times if we play up to our potential. We’ve had some good practices this week, and we’re going to be ready to go.”
Harvard can catch Dartmouth in the Ivy League standings if it wins all four of its contests this weekend. If that happens, the Crimson will have forced a fifth matchup between the Crimson and the Big Green—a one-game playoff to determine the Rolfe Division representative at the Ivy Championship Series.
“We definitely have a high mountain to climb,” senior southpaw Brent Suter said. “We need to win five games in a row to stay alive…. Dartmouth is a good team, and they’ve been good for all our time here. It’d be a great way to send off our seniors by having a good weekend against them.”
Between Harvard and a shot at its first Ancient Eight crown since 2005 stands a formidable Big Green lineup. Dartmouth comes into the weekend on a nine-game winning streak and has won seven of its last eight Ivy games. After its most recent four-game sweep of Yale, two Big Green pitchers—Kyle Hunter and Thomas Olson—garnered weekly All-Ivy honors.
“Our pitching and our defense are both going to be key,” Suter said. “We can’t have any errors, and we’re going to need some timely hitting…. We need to be on our game for all four games and, like coach always says, play with a chip on our shoulder.”
Dustin Selzer—who leads the league with 34 RBIs—will likely be another player to watch for this weekend.
For the Big Green, a piece of history is also at stake, as the team looks to make its fifth-straight trip to the Ivy Championship Series—a program record.
“They’re a team that is used to winning, which is one of their biggest strengths,” Reynolds said. “But that’s also something we can turn into our own advantage if we come out strong…. If we get them on their heels by winning the first few games, we could take four or five from them.”
But a Harvard team that started off the season dropping 16 of its first 17 games has steadily improved over the course of 2012, culminating in its three-win weekend against the Bears.
“We had a lot of guys step up [against Brown],” Reynolds said. “[Senior] Marcus Way hit a walk-off homerun, which was huge, and Jake McGuiggan…drove in a lot of runs for us. We were putting together really good at-bats all weekend. It was nice to see everything come together for us.”
The Crimson can also lay claim to the two most recent nods to the Ivy Player of the Week list in Reynolds and McGuiggan. Reynolds currently leads the Crimson with 49 hits and 21 RBIs, while McGuiggan holds a team-best .349 batting average.
The senior went a stellar 11-of-18 at the plate in Harvard’s best week of the year, helping the Crimson to three conference wins.
“Stuff is coming together nicely for us now,” Way said. “We’ve had some struggles both pitching and hitting, but everything has come together. We’re going to need to pick up where we left off if we want to beat Dartmouth.”
In the Gehrig Division, a similar storyline to that of the matchup between Dartmouth and Harvard will play out in the next few days as well. League-leading Cornell holds a three-game advantage over the defending Ivy champion, Princeton, and will close its season with four games against the Tigers.
Cornell needs at least two wins to punch its ticket to the conference championship series, while Princeton needs a sweep. If the Tigers win exactly three games, there will be a one-game playoff to decide which team will represent the Gehrig Division in the final series of the 2012.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s basketball center Keith Wright, a former Ivy League Player of the Year and two-time All-Ivy League player has spent much of his Harvard career in the gymnasium working on his array of post moves and more recently, preparing himself to pursue a career in professional basketball. When he’s not in the gym, Wright, a Psychology concentrator in Leverett House, is an avid student looking to become a future couples therapist. We caught up with Wright to ask him a few questions about his aspirations to go into relationship counseling.
The Havard Crimson: So, what has led you to want to become a couples therapist? How long have you wanted to do this?
Keith Wright: I think I had that set in mind that when I entered college it was something that I wanted to do. I wanted to enter psychology, and I didn’t ever waver, and it’s now my concentration. Taking [Psych 1503: The Psychology of Close Relationships] last semester, that kind of sealed the deal for me and [helped me to decide] that [relationship counseling] is something I want to pursue after my basketball career.
 
THC: Have you ever counseled anyone before and at what point did you realize that you liked counseling people?
KW: My friends come to me and talk to me about stuff that has been going in in their personal lives. A lot of them talk to me about stuff that’s going on with people they’re dating. It’s something that I’ve had happen to me pretty much my whole life. They always seem to listen to my advice, and it seems to work, and I just like to help people.
THC: What separates you from just any random person in terms of relationship advice? Are you qualified to advise people?
KW: I don’t think that I’m more qualified right now, but I think that once my basketball career is over and I go back to school, then I’ll be qualified. Just through my experiences through relationships that I’ve had will help me. People aren’t afraid to talk to me about those things, and I’m not afraid to tell people what they don’t like hearing.
THC: What are the keys to a successful relationship at Harvard?
KW: Communication is definitely key. I think communication is important in any relationship, not just in a relationship here [at Harvard]. Communication with time, understanding that as athletes—and there are some athletes that are dating non-athletes—playing a sport takes up a lot of time. Being able to communicate that will help a relationship out. So just not being afraid to open up and tell whoever you’re with how you really feel [is crucial]. You should be able to talk to whoever you’re with like you’re talking to a friend.
THC: What are the top three important things in a relationship?
KW: I think communication is definitely there. Honesty, when you communicate, you have to be honest. I think also being your own person and not letting the relationship define you and being your own individual are definitely key.
THC: What's the most romantic thing you have ever done?
KW: I think I’m just genuine. If you ask any of my friends, they will tell you I’m an honest guy straight up. I don’t know, I think some girls will find that romantic—someone that’s going to be honest with them—and there aren’t a lot of honest people out there when it comes to that.
 
THC: There's a cute girl in my section, but I've never really had a real conversation with her. What's my play?
KW: You should have a conversation with her. If your section was yesterday, and if it was really fun or really boring, then it’s easy to start up a conversation because you have something that you guys have in common. Just start up that conversation. You shouldn’t be afraid—after all that and she’s still not interested, you’ve done your job, you’ve done all you can do.
 
THC: Have you ever had your heart broken before?
KW: Yes, yes I have.
THC: Looking back on past relationships, what would be some relationship advice you would have given yourself? 
KW: Just to take every relationship as a learning experience. Don’t look at it as a negative, but try to take something positive out of it. [For example in] a situation when you’re moving away or you guys just fell apart, think about that time you really cared about that person, you really loved them and they really loved you—[at least] you know how it feels to be loved by someone. Some other relationships end because there is no communication. I’ve learned [from those relationships] that it’s important to communicate how I feel before it’s too late. And this might sound kind of cliché, but at the end of the day, there are always other fish in the sea.
THC: Has your mother/family influenced you in any way to want to become a couples therapist?
KW: Yeah, definitely. My mom is someone that has been married twice and then divorced twice, so seeing that, growing up with that is definitely hard. It was definitely hard on my mom and on the family. I just want to have the opportunity to help somebody’s family, to help somebody’s relationship so they don’t have to grow up like I did.
 
 
 
THC: What is your attitude towards salvaging a troubled relationship versus helping a couple break up?
KW: It all depends on the couple. [I think] if the couple is coming to you for guidance, they’re not looking to end things, they’re looking to you to help them in working their relationship out and turning it around. Hopefully I don’t ever have to help a couple separate. [I would like to focus] on helping their relationship instead of ending it.
THC: Are you looking to help people with things like sexual assault/domestic violence within relationships?
KW: If that comes up, you definitely have to help. That’s definitely something that you cannot turn away. I don’t know how often that comes up [in relationship counseling], but if something like that comes up, you have to help that person. I’m definitely open to helping people.
THC: Are you going to counsel for all couples, including gay couples?
KW: I think I’d be willing to do it all. I have a gay uncle in my family, and actually my sister is gay so I’m not opposed to help them there. I think they are normal people like us, with normal relationships and normal problems.

President Eliot has just received from the Embassy of the United States at Berlin the following letter which explains itself: BERLIN, April 14, 1902.
"Dr. Charles W. Eliot. President of Harvard College, Cambridge, Massachusetts:
"Dear Sir: Referring to my letter of the 7th instant, I have much pleasure in informing you that I had the honor of being received by the German Emperor yesterday, and of presenting to His Majesty in person the "Vote of Thanks" passed by yourself and the Fellows of Harvard College in acknowledgment of the notice given by His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Prussia of the generous gift which His Majesty proposes to send to Harvard University for the Germanic Museum."
April 27, 1933: Just as Many Students Jailed Now as Ever
"I've been here for 34 years and I haven't seen one real riot," said Captain J. J. Donohue of the Brattle Street Police Station yesterday. "In the old days there used to be a lot more fun," he added. "There was more money and more spirit in Harvard then, with fraternity initiations and traditional Freshman brawls.
"The Harvard man of today is essentially the same as he was twenty years ago," declared Captain Donohue, "but the dying out of the fraternities and the oncome of Prohibition have done away with most of the old time spirit of fun. Why, in the old days the lads would drink two or three quarts of champagne and a few bottles of real heavy P. B. ale and then go out and have a great time. You know it's only ten years since the old tradition of Bloody Monday passed away. That was a great old Freshman tradition. On the first Monday of October the fellows would gather in the Square. Someone would knock off another man's hat and the fun would begin, usually ending with a few real fights and a few Freshmen in the cooler."

April 26, 1956: Pusey Tells Alumni That University Requires $40 Million for Buildings
In what he called his "most serious and important speech" since assuming Harvard's presidency, Nathan M. Pusey told the most prominent alumni audience he will address all year that the University requires at least $40 million to carry on a badly needed building program.
April 27, 1979: Librarian Considers Proposal To Install Carpeting in Lamont
Squeak. Squeak.
Lawrence J. Kipp. recently-appointed College librarian, said yesterday he is considering a proposal from library staff to carpet Lamont Library.
Kipp said if he approves the recommendation, work will begin this summer at an estimated cost of $50,000, depending on the amount of floor space to be carpeted.
Jane R. Morhardt, assistant librarian of Lamont, said yesterday notes in the library's suggestion box indicate students' largest complaint about Lamont is the squeaky floors.
