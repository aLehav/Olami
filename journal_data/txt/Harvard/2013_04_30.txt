After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Whereas Americans once scanned the Civil War photos of Matthew Brady, or read the prose of Ernie Pyle, or ingested TV footage of the war in Vietnam, today they find opacity. With the modern mode of surreptitious, anti-terror drone strikes, public knowledge is scant and any informed insight worth especial value. Last week, Farea al-Muslimi, a Yemeni citizen, provided exactly that in a testimony before Congress. Al-Muslimi related personal accounts of drone-induced backlash against America and against him, a U.S. supporter, explaining how civilian deaths from drones “destabilize my country.” His words should give us pause.
Of course, al-Muslimi’s sentiments will do little to derail the United States’ drone programs, in part for good reason. The lures of unmanned warfare have long attracted militarists—as early as the fifth century B.C.E., Thucydides described an unmanned “ship set on fire” employed against the Athenian navy. By now, the U.S. drone arsenal has expanded to roughly 7,000 aircraft, with benefits including maneuverability and elimination of risk to the pilot. A clear majority of Americans support drones’ anti-terror strikes. And some research even suggests that anti-personnel strikes via drone may cause fewer civilian deaths than similar attacks without drones. Still, drones remain regrettably imperfect implements.
In a previous editorial, we applauded Senator Rand Paul’s efforts to probe the Obama administration’s drone policies, with a particular eye toward domestic implications. We quoted Patrick Henry, who said, “The liberties of a people never were, nor ever will be, secure, when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them.” Those words apply equally to drones used abroad. President Obama, the military, and the CIA should offer more transparency about U.S. drone programs.
That does not mean we want a list of strikes before they happen. Instead, however, we do need a greater understanding of their scope and nature. American voters should not be left with the Hobson between blindly endorsing the deaths of foreign nationals—plus U.S. citizens, too—and sitting idly. Hopefully, the administration’s plans to fold the CIA’s drone operations into the military’s will provide a better basis for establishing and appreciating the total scope. One fact is certain: The status quo is not sufficient.
In the past, the U.S. alternative to drone transparency in Yemen was for erstwhile Yemeni strongman Abdullah Saleh to claim ownership of the strikes. That arrangement lost its secrecy in the Wikileaks scandal (and may never have truly fooled locals), but the need for a cover-up in the first place is a tacit concession to al-Muslimi’s charge. Drones do not operate in a vacuum. In Pakistan, for instance, 93 percent of those aware of drone strikes believe they are a “bad” or “very bad” thing, according to Pew Research Center, and large majorities oppose drones even in countries whose residents are not at risk—from Egypt and Jordan to Japan and Brazil. The immediate, physical ramifications of drone strikes cannot be divorced from their role in a larger psychological and ideological struggle. The United States should take a more proactive role in making sure that its drone program is conducted with minimal international blowback and harm to civilians. It should carefully weigh the true costs of each strike.
In the face of those costs, the United States must grow its drone fleet transparently and responsibly, bearing in mind that the field’s whirlwind technological pace is not a proxy for normative sanction. Unmanned aerial vehicles have the potential, in the long run, to save American and foreign lives. But a belief in the importance or inexorability of drone warfare should not stop us from asking how we ought to conduct it.

In 1950, The Weavers released “Tzena, Tzena, Tzena,” the first and only Hebrew-language song to top the charts in America. Encouraging girls to leave the farm and greet returning soldiers, the lyrics recall the agrarianism and honest poverty of Israel’s youth. An affecting if verklempt ditty, “Tzena” matters most because of the people who sang it. The Weavers—Lee Hays, Ronnie Gilbert, Fred Hellerman, and Pete Seeger—were the Lewis and Clark of the early 1960s folk music revival, surveying territory Peter, Paul, and Mary, The Byrds, and pre-electric Bob Dylan would roam. The band broke up in 1955, the victim of the House Un-American Activities Committee and the blacklist. Seeger, later to become the big macher of the folkies, had been a card-carrying communist. The other three had been fellow travelers. Progressive troubadours, they were enamored with Israel, including in their repertoire several other Hebrew tunes.
Now lost in the Billy Bragg agit-prop, Israel was once a revelation to the left. And with good reason. The settlers of the Second Aliyah were socialists, and they transmuted the Mir, the Russian peasant’s communal farm and the intelligentsia’s idée fixe, to the kibbutz, the organizing unit of Jewish economic activity during the Mandate period. As independence approached, the Yishuv was so in the thrall of leftism that the State Department feared a Jewish state might come under Soviet tutelage.
A springtide of neoliberalism washed over Tel Aviv in the 1980s, tearing down the kibbutz from its status as a national symbol. The country has also grown more religious, with fully 30 percent of Israeli Jews identifying as Orthodox. And what liberal or leftist of good conscience could forget Israel’s occupation of the West Bank?
But it’s time to hear Israel’s side of the breakup story. By 1945, six million Jewish bodies had been burned to ashes or tossed into mass graves. 250,000 survivors clamored to leave behind the bloodlands for Palestine. The British, fearing Arab recriminations, moved to block large-scale immigration. That led to memorable showdowns like the 1947 Exodus incident, in which Jews trying to enter the Mandate were detained off-coast and deported to Germany. British wantonness, added to the Nazi horrors, rendered the Jews perfect victims, intensifying the left’s ephemeral support for the establishment of a national home.
Though the left had historically protected the individual Jew in his rights as a citizen, it was highly antagonistic toward the Jew as a member of a distinct collectivity. In “On the Jewish Question,” Marx posits that Judaism, in its practical sense, is the worship of money, and that true freedom requires the emancipation of society from “Judaism.” After his overtures toward Israel were rejected, Stalin drew on (and distorted) Marxist criticism in a campaign against Soviet Jewry. Orchestrating the murders of prominent intellectuals and suppressing Yiddish culture, he alleged the Jews were Zionist agents, the servants of a bourgeois nationalist movement opposed to communist internationalism. His brand of anti-Semitism outlived him, creating a propaganda machine that linked Zionism with racism and cast the Israelis as Nazis.
Imperative to the liberal-left turn against Israel was the bloc’s fetishization of victimhood. The man of the left enlisted himself in the defense of the marginalized and unfairly maligned. But weakness came to be thought the sole qualifier of victimhood. Often constructed where it did not exist, victimhood was invested with moral uprightness; the “victim,” deprived of agency, was freed from scrutiny. Inversely, the powers-that-be were believed immeasurably evil, earning the left’s un-abating scorn. Documented in the work of New York Intellectuals Leslie Fiedler and Robert Warshow, this phenomenon was on full exhibition in the Rosenberg case.
After Israel romped in the Six-Day War, capturing the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Golan Heights, and Sinai Peninsula, it was no longer the victim. The Jewish state was a regional power. This presented a challenge to the leftist Weltanschauung.
Fortunately for the left, the non-aligned countries of the Third World and Middle East were then making common cause against the West and vestiges of imperial control at the United Nations. The Palestine Liberation Organization, aided by post-modernism, deftly assimilated itself into such a narrative; Palestinians were the righteous victims of the militant, colonial Israeli juggernaut. Soviet dreck, once confined to the Iron Curtain schmattes, found expression at the U.N. in 1975, as the General Assembly passed an Arab-sponsored resolution equating Zionism with racism.
That pathogen endures. Its initial reservoir of infection, the Soviet Union, was long ago eradicated, yet its means of transmission, the victimhood complex, remains intact. One need only think of “Israeli apartheid” and “pink-washing.” Or look at the folkies. A decade ago, Ronnie Gilbert joined Women In Black, an organization aiding Palestinian anti-occupation activism. Seeger recently endorsed Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions against Israel movement.

This February, the threat of North Korea’s nuclear program resurfaced in the media as the nation declared it had conducted its third nuclear test. After the U.S. responded by increasing economic sanctions, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea promptly demanded their removal as a first step towards continuing peace talks.
Despite the country’s expressed interest in diplomacy, North Korea has proven time and again that it is unfazed by concessions and, most importantly, uncommitted to compromises. Therefore, the U.S. must keep all sanctions in place and must, above all, not acquiesce to North Korea’s bargaining tactics.
Concerns about the detrimental effects that strict sanctions can have on the country’s severely precarious economy are not unwarranted. With a GDP per capita of $1,800, North Korea lamentably stands at the bottom of the global economic ladder. However, this has not deterred the nation from investing a copious amount of its funds to develop its nuclear program. North Korea is reported to allocate close to a third of its government spending to defense, a large part of which was unquestionably distributed toward building nuclear arms. All the while, the North Korean public continues to be heavily repressed and subjected to widespread famine as a result of the country’s failure to distribute funds and other resources to its people.
Instead of searching for ways to contribute its own national revenue to helping combat the devastating food shortage, North Korea has chosen the alternative route of using what is effectively blackmail in order to receive humanitarian aid. Especially after North Korea violated the terms of the 1994 Agreed Framework by clandestinely developing a uranium enrichment program, the international community has witnessed a persisting pattern of bargaining behavior. The DPRK’s bargaining tactics are marked by threats against nations like the U.S. and South Korea which are then followed by the demand of concessions or compromise.  Nonetheless, any attempt at negotiating has been and will continue to be futile as long as North Korea prioritizes arms over the good of its citizens.
For example, in February 2012, the Obama administration was prepared to offer 240,000 metric tons of food assistance as a gesture toward augmenting bilateral relations. However, the DPRK opted instead to continue to push its nuclear agenda by passing U.N. resolutions and launching yet another rocket. Such actions should serve as confirmation not only that is North Korea uninterested in ceasing the buildup of nuclear arms, but also that it has no true intentions of bringing humanitarian relief to its people. If the DPRK genuinely wishes to make a turnaround, change must begin internally before any moves toward diplomacy are made, and preemptive strikes must not continue to function as North Korea’s primary source of sustenance.
Fears that the DPRK could soon become a nuclear powerhouse and destroy any region it wishes to target, while not completely irrational, are not very likely to be confirmed. Even if North Korea decided to carry out an attack against the U.S. while ignoring the possibility of devastating retaliation from America and its allies, the DPRK’s highest capability missile thus far, the Taepodong-2, would only reach a portion of Alaska. Given that North Korea seems to be overstating its stance as a nuclear power, for now, our focus should not necessarily be on the possibility of a DPRK-American nuclear war. However, it is imperative that the international community monitor North Korea’s compliance or lack thereof to UN Security Council Resolutions 1718, a mandate that instated a series of economic and commercial sanctions against the country.
Most alarmingly, the DPRK has not only failed to abide by the stipulations of the resolution, but it is now not the only nation benefiting from its perpetual buildup of nuclear arms. North Korea has been discovered exporting nuclear technology to conflict-ridden states such as Syria, Iran, and Myanmar, which in turn makes its nuclear program a greater threat to international stability. Therefore, even if North Korea should opt to use its nuclear program simply as a bargaining tool to receive foreign aid, the possibility that other states may one day build up and begin using this weaponry is an equal cause for concern.
Dealing with the North Korea nuclear crisis is trouble enough without the spreading of nuclear power to other rogue states, and the international community must under no circumstances give in to DPRK pleas to loosen sanctions. Additionally, the U.S. must put an end to monetary aid while also limiting food assistance.
Doing so will not only force the nation to become accountable for sustaining its own people, but it will also be a definitive gesture displaying the fortitude of the United States and its steadfast refusal to condone the DPRK’s bargaining ploys.

I don’t have an iPhone. I don’t have a smartphone. And, shocker: It hasn’t really been a problem.
True, I’ll probably never get to a Masters and Meatballs—that sign-up fills fast. True, I’ve gotten lost walking home from the ICA. And true, if I stay put while technology keeps advancing, I’ll probably lose all my friends in three years when Words with Friends upgrades from a game to a virtual universe.
But I’m happy with my little red flip phone, and I’ve gotten good at pithy explanations as to why. It hasn’t broken yet, so no point in replacing it. Touch keyboards are dangerous for people who have ham fingers. Same goes for easily fumble-able—and breakable—screens.  I don’t want to feel compelled to take over an expensive data plan once my parents cut me off (estimated date: June 2014). I don’t want to ever feel compelled to play Angry Birds.
But my problems with smartphones go deeper than that. No matter how much I mock Yahoo! Shine articles about unplugging, they have a real point: We are addicted to technology. It scares me that I have to fight the urge to check my email every 10 minutes while I’m doing work. It scares me that I’m dependent on a device to hold all my thoughts, as well as all music, bank records, and interactions with friends. And when that access becomes pocket-sized rather than merely portable, it becomes even more consuming than it already, terrifyingly is.
With iPhones, the flow of information does not—cannot—stop. Rather than just the crowded voices of friends and family—and, okay, a few rounds of Snake—smartphones guarantee that the noise of the entire internet is always with us. With that much information available, we are obligated to always be on top of it. After all, there is a whole world out there, and it’s more important than the path between Boylston and Sever. And especially here at Harvard, there’s a sense of shame or lost opportunity in not being fully informed about current events or when Matt Damon tickets go on sale. A covert check of the iPhone, a scan of your emails as you head to class, and you’re ready to fulfill the Harvard stereotype, casually knowing everyone and everything.
It is important to stay informed about the world as a whole, but it’s coming at the expense of being informed about our world as a home. I’m impressed by how much my classmates know about the Syrian “Red Line” when some know so little about the Boston Red Line. Because that’s the other problem with iPhones—they store so much of our knowledge that it is always accessible, but never internalized. And then suddenly the train is however many feet below ground, all service is lost, and there’s nothing but a defective map (nice, Apple), a downloaded edition of “The Odyssey,” and our own wits to keep us from ending up in Mattapan. And everyone else in the train is too engrossed in their own devices or mumblings to actually help out.
Even if we don’t end up stranded in the subterranean, addiction does make us sink to new lows. People used to joke about Crackberries, and there’s definitely some self-deprecation about iPhone dependence. But I don’t think we really realize how addicted we are. And unlike most addictions, where you at least get a rush, iPhone use seems more like a struggle to participate than a pleasure in itself. As we saw a few weeks ago, we expect news to keep up with our addiction to the point that we end up creating the news, via Twitter and Reddit and blog comments, while we continue to watch the same five witnesses saying the same five stories. A lack of knowledge that would once have made us feel frustrated now leaves us frantic and powerless.
Even with just my flip phone, I’m an addict too. I make plans with one person while sitting with another. I let my eyes wander to my open computer when I really should listen to a friend. And I can’t stop checking that email.  Forgoing the iPhone is one of the few self-imposed checks I’ve managed to construct, so that at least, sometimes, I have radio silence—which, of course, I fill with the deepest reflections and most ground-breaking conclusions rather than speculations about which professor would be the best windsurfer.
But, praise be, at least I don’t have to Snapchat. Just because that picture is going to be deleted in 10 seconds doesn’t mean that I don’t see you making that face in section.

Standing behind her acclaimed painting “Jesus of the People”—a depiction of Christ as a young black man—artist Janet McKenzie spoke about her art and inspiration Monday night at Memorial Church.
In honor of the Arts First festival last weekend, Memorial Church displayed this painting and several of McKenzie’s other works. Her art depicted a series of religious subjects, dominated by a recurring black Madonna figure.
McKenzie’s speech was part of the annual William Belden Noble Lectures series, which has featured notable theologians, including Harvey G. Cox, Jr., a former Harvard Divinity School professor, and Robert Runcie, a former Archbishop of Canterbury.
In his introduction to the lecture, Reverend Jonathan L. Walton, Pusey Minister in Memorial Church and Plummer Professor of Christian Morals, elaborated on the unique perspective McKenzie brought as a female artist devoted to creating religious art that incorporates racial and sexual diversity.
“It is important to bring someone to this space that reminds us we are all made in the imago dei, the image of God,” Walton said.
In a speech entitled “Longing and Hope—My Journey into the Sacred,” McKenzie said that the death of her mother when she was 24 led her to focus on marginalized people, especially women, in her art.
“To give women, all women, a voice through my art is one of my calls,” McKenzie said.
McKenzie spoke primarily about “Jesus of the People” and its impact on her life. She created the painting for the 1999 National Catholic Reporter competition that challenged artists to portray Christ for the new millennium. McKenzie said her inspiration was her nephew, who, as a young man of color, had trouble relating to her work. Chosen out of 1,700 entries, “Jesus of the People” took off in a way McKenzie never expected, garnering worldwide attention and praise.
A self-described “recluse” living a “monastic” life in the Northeast Kingdom region of Vermont, McKenzie said she was left “numb” and “shocked” after such widespread publicity.
McKenzie said that while she faced dissent from the Westboro Baptist Church and others in response to her paintings, these responses did not keep her from creating more inspiring and inclusive works of art.
She showed several of these additional works on a projector and described the backstories that inspired her to portray religious themes such as the Magi or the Holy Family.
Susan B. Grefe, a long-time Memorial Church-goer, said she is an admirer of McKenzie’s work due to her “clear” and “not cluttered” style, adding that McKenzie’s work inspires her to “look at religious art in a new way.”

Part Two of a five-part series on Harvard's approaching capital campaign. Part One was published on April 29, Part Three on May 1, Part Four on May 2, and Part Five on May 3.
As Harvard embarks on an ambitious, multi-billion dollar fundraising campaign, students and administrators are searching for ways to distribute an unprecedented sum of donations within the College—the Harvard school that makes up nearly a third of the University’s total enrollment.
Although coordinators of the campaign have not released the specific dollar amounts of the College’s fundraising goals, several upcoming projects—including the renovation of all 12 of Harvard’s residential Houses, the expansion of financial aid initiatives, and the construction of a new student center—suggest that a sizable chunk of the campaign’s proceeds will ultimately benefit undergraduates.
“I think [the capital campaign] is definitely going to be College-focused,” former Undergraduate Council President Danny P. Bicknell ’13 said.
This past November, as one of the final initiatives in his administration, Bicknell helped launch the Capital Campaign Task Force—the main mediating body working to add a student voice to high-level negotiations over how the money will be spent.
“Students expressed frustration that they didn’t know what was going on,” he said. “We created the committee to re-engage students and help the administrators define some of these areas that we need funds for.”
THREE ‘BIG BUCKETS’
In an interview with The Crimson this February, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds said that three of the University’s main priorities in the upcoming capital campaign were “very closely tied to the College.” These three priorities, which Hammonds called “big buckets,” are support for House Renewal, financial aid, and “teaching and learning” initiatives.
Of these priorities, House Renewal has garnered the most public attention since 2011, when Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith announced that Old Quincy House would be the first building to be renovated.
The Old Quincy test project is nearing completion, and improvements to Leverett’s McKinlock Hall are scheduled to begin in early June.
Administrators have predicted that the entire project will cost roughly $1 to $1.3 billion, a large part of which is expected to come from funds raised during the capital campaign.
Student members of the House Program Planning Committee, which was tasked to issue a report with recommendations for the project, said that discussions on the role of the capital campaign in securing funds for House renewal have been ongoing since 2009, when the committee released a report detailing the state of House life at Harvard.
Former Undergraduate Council President Senan Ebrahim ’12, who has served as an HPPC co-chair, said that part of the group’s task was to determine how to most effectively utilize the College’s resources during the construction period.
“House Renewal has been a priority for administrators for as long as I can remember,” Ebrahim said.
Financial aid has similarly remained a top concern for the College since 2004, when former University President Lawrence H. Summers launched a financial aid program geared towards low-income students.
Since then, the percentage of students receiving financial aid has increased from 40 percent to 60 percent, in part a product of more recent pushes to expand financial aid for middle-class families.
“Harvard is one of the few institutions where financial aid is growing faster than tuition,” said Jake W. C. Silberg ’15, who sits on the student-led Capital Campaign Task Force.
According to meeting minutes from a presentation given to the U. C. task force in March, Assistant Dean of FAS Development Services Beth B. Thompson said that, of the $182 million in financial aid allotted for the upcoming school year, approximately 60 percent came from scholarship gifts from donors and the remaining 40 percent came from internal unrestricted funds raised through other avenues, such as the capital campaign.
And although teaching and learning initiatives have maintained a lower profile than the other two “big buckets,” administrators have also said they want to prioritize promoting innovative pedogogical practices in Harvard classrooms with efforts like the Initiative on Learning and Teaching, announced in 2011. These initiatives may also impact the academic experiences of undergraduates.
With House Renewal plans surging forward, the financial aid program expanding, and teaching and learning efforts taking shape, several of the initiatives listed by administrators as priorities for the upcoming campaign will evidently benefit the College.
“Although it’s going to be a University-wide capital campaign, the College will definitely play a significant part,” Bicknell said.
A STUDENT VOICE
As University administrators and fundraisers continue to define goals and priorities for the campaign, students have sought to shape the way that incoming funds will be allocated at the College.
In October 2012, a year after the Undergraduate Council published a report calling for the creation of a campus-wide student center, Faust told The Crimson in an interview that this project would be “a priority” in the upcoming capital campaign.
Motivated partly by Faust’s endorsement of a student center, the UC launched the Capital Campaign Task Force the following month.
According to several committee members, the UC task force has focused primarily on financial aid and House Renewal—two potential “buckets” that administrators and fundraisers have also prioritized.
“Financial aid is my top priority,” said Silberg. “Harvard’s generous financial aid is what allows me to be here.”
Sam G. Greenberg ’14 said that administrators have similarly emphasized financial aid when communicating with the task force.
“It’s been portrayed to be a very big priority in the materials that we’ve received,” he said.
Both administrators and members of the task force placed a premium on House Renewal as well, committee members said.
“These are dorms that are getting close to be 100 years old,” Silberg said. “Now that they’re moving into this phase of housing renewal, I think that’s something that students will really benefit from.”
Task force member Michael E. Danto ’13 said that the Harvard Alumni Affairs and Development Office has also emphasized the central role of House Renewal in their discussions with the task force.
“We’ve heard that House Renewal is something that they’re talking about a lot with potential donors,” he said.
GROWING INFLUENCE?
While some committee members questioned the efficacy of the task force in shaping administrators’ priorities, others said that the current goals of the University have already been influenced by student input collected over the past decade.
“I feel like we’re picking from options that are more or less laid out for us,” said Greenberg, who said that he doubted that the UC task force had the clout necessary to change the capital campaign objectives already outlined by administrators. “It’s not like they’re taking huge pains to make sure that student voices are a big part of the process.”
Other members pointed the role that student input is currently playing in plans for House Renewal as a sign of the University’s willingness to accommodate undergraduate concerns more broadly.
“One thing that I was impressed to find out was how much prior student input has been collected over the course of the last decade and is going into decisions that the University is making today,” said Danto.
The influence of previously collected student input left the task force hopeful about the potential for change.
“It seems like a lot of the recommendations we make could affect some of the specific issues that the University has planned,” Danto said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tucked in an alley between Holyoke Street and Dunster Street, the after-hours entrance to Harvard University Health Services has been a destination for students seeking medical help for their intoxicated friends.
Administrators say that Harvard University’s alcohol policy, which guarantees that students who go to or take others to UHS for medical treatment stemming from alcohol or drug use will not be punished, is designed to encourage students to place health and safety above all else.
But for some students, the repercussions of an alcohol-related UHS trip carry over beyond the hospital visit itself—causing them and others to question whether they should make the trip to after-hours at all.
Harvard’s “amnesty policy”—first implemented in 2007 and reaffirmed in last March’s revised College-wide alcohol policy—states that students seeking medical treatment for alcohol or drug-related illnesses for themselves or a friend will not face disciplinary actions for any illegal substance use, according to the Harvard University Student Handbook.
For administrators, a concern about student health is the underlying premise of the policy.
“The important thing about the amnesty policy is that the health of members of the Harvard community is paramount, and so the prospect of disciplinary action should never keep someone from seeking help on behalf of friends or for themselves,” Ivy Yard Dean William Cooper ’94 wrote in an email.
However, the amnesty policy was also designed to take patterns of behavior—often seen in multiple late-night visits to UHS—into account, and it is this underlying concern over less formal disciplinary measures that some say limits the efficacy of the policy. Potential repercussions after repeated health incidents involving drugs or alcohol can include a warning by a House Master or Dean, admonishment by the Administrative Board, and, eventually, probation or requirement to temporarily withdraw from the College.
For example, after a student’s second transport to UHS, the Freshman Dean’s Office draws up a contract outlining, on a case by case basis, the College’s expectations for how he or she will avoid dangerous drinking in the future. At this second meeting, the deans also encourage students to contact their parents about the incidents to arrange a follow-up conversation between administrators and the parents.
“With the contract it’s not really meant to be ‘Got you!’ If you’ve failed to meet the terms, we have serious concerns about how you’re taking care of yourself,” said Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67. “If you want to stay through the rest of this year, you cannot be drinking and you cannot find yourself in similar circumstances.”
Some students interviewed for this story said they have taken advantage of the policy in order to get their friends treated.
“Looking back at the one time I did have to take a friend to UHS, it was more based on the impulse of making sure that that friend was safe and was in good hands,” said Jenny Choi ’16. “I did not feel prepared enough to be able to take care of that friend.”
Several others, however, said that the policy—along with the prospect of further meetings with deans and parents—may be a deterrent in deciding whether to seek help.
“There’s a thought of, ‘Why bring them to UHS if I can take care of them better myself?’ That way they have no disciplinary issues to deal with,” said Adam O. Brodheim ’16.
Juan E. Bedoya ’16 said that he has taken care of several friends who were inebriated, but chose not to take them to University Health Services because of the potential awkwardness of talking to an administrator after an incident relating to alcohol.
Another freshman, who was granted anonymity by The Crimson to protect her roommate’s privacy, said she has been hesitant to use UHS after her roommate’s second trip to Stillman Infirmary.
“The Dean in our Yard gave her the ultimatum that if she had to go one more time there would be serious repercussions,” she said. “So even though she has abused alcohol in a scary and dangerous way since then, my friends and I don’t want to take her to UHS because we don’t want to be the reason she gets asked to leave.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Tuesday, voters will head to the polls for the special-election primary to fill the state’s vacated U.S. Senate seat. But experts predict that turnout will be low in the election to pick between either party-line-Democrat Edward J. Markey and his underdog, more moderate challenger Stephen F. Lynch, or a diverse slate of Republican hopefuls.
If all goes as predicted by pollsters and pundits, Markey, a 37-year veteran of the House of Representatives, will defeat Rep. Lynch of South Boston. Markey has raised over three times more in campaign funds and has also secured the endorsements of a host of leading Democrats, including the former senior Senator from Massachusetts, John F. Kerry, whose appointment as Secretary of State vacated the contested seat.
After Massachusetts Secretary of State William F. Galvin estimated on Monday that about 120,000 fewer voters would cast ballots in this Democratic primary than did in the 2009 special election primary for senate, Daniel B. Payne, a Democratic media consultant who has worked for Markey, said that the conditions seemed to favor the longtime congressman from Malden.
“In a low turnout election, the core of the Massachusetts Democrats are going to be the ones who turnout,” Payne said Monday afternoon. “[Low turnout] helps Ed Markey because Ed Markey has been organizing since February, and he’s going to have 5,000 people working for him tomorrow.”
Andrew Zucker, a spokesperson for Markey, was also optimistic about Markey’s prospects.
“We’re confident in our grassroots field operation,” he wrote in an email. “It’s the strongest by far of any campaign in this state.” Zucker added that 9,000 volunteers were active in the Markey campaign.
Lynch, who was off the campaign trail due to illness for most of Monday, had been campaigning at a breakneck pace for the last week of the race. The campaigns had shuttered down after the bombings on Marathon Monday, but largely restarted after the alleged bombers were apprehended.
Though recent polls have shown him trailing Markey by about 10 points, Lynch, whose supporter base is seen as solid and dependable, predicted a narrow victory last week after a debate in Springfield.
Payne said that in order for Lynch to pull off the upset, he will need an extremely high turnout in and around his South Boston voter-base, and will also need to keep pace with Markey in affluent suburbs surrounding the city.
“If Newton has a decent turnout and a big margin for Markey, Markey is going to win big,” Payne said. “If it’s a low turnout and the margin is a little closer, that bodes well for Lynch.”
On the Republican side, Harvard Business School graduate and former Navy SEAL Gabriel E. Gomez has raised more money than former U.S. Attorney Michael J. Sullivan and State Rep. Daniel B. Winslow combined and leads in a recent poll.
Gomez campaign spokesperson Will Ritter that he was encouraged by an estimate from Secretary of State Galvin that turnout in the Republican primary would be higher than in 2009 by about 35,000 voters.
“[Higher turnout] means that there are people who are hearing about the election because they are interested in Gabriel Gomez, in our message, and in a candidate who is different,” Ritter told The Crimson on Monday night.
Joseph Selvaggi, a Republican who challenged Lynch in the 8th congressional district race last November, was not as optimistic about the projected turnout, which he said might not be high enough to be a game changer for Gomez.
“I don’t think the people will show up to vote in the way that the Gomez campaign thinks they will,” Selvaggi said, adding that a low turnout would probably favor Sullivan, who is seen as the most uniformly conservative of the Republicans.
Colin Graham, a spokesperson for Winslow, dismissed claims that the low turnout would benefit the most conservative candidate.
“We’ve made over 150,000 live—not automated—calls to likely GOP voters,” Graham wrote in an email. “In a low turnout election, that kind of investment is going to pay huge dividends.”
Despite weak performances in public polling, Winslow, who is considered the most liberal of the Republican candidates, has won the endorsements of the Boston Globe, the Boston Herald, and the Springfield Republican, and a recent advertisement from his campaign claims that he has been endorsed by every major paper in Massachusetts.
Graham said that daily internal polling conducted by the Winslow campaign showed the race close between the three Republicans.
“Some days Sullivan is on top, sometimes Winslow,” Graham said of the surveys. “Our tracking shows Gomez having the least amount of identified, confirmed voters.”
Polls open at 7 a.m. Tuesday morning and close at 8 p.m. in the evening. The winner of the Democratic primary will face the winner of the Republican primary in a special election on June 25.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SOUTH BOSTON—Voters trekked to the polls Tuesday morning to cast ballots in the party primaries that by tonight will narrow the field of serious contenders for the state’s U.S. Senate seat down to two.
On Monday, Secretary of State William F. Galvin, the state’s top election official, predicted that overall turnout would decline from 2009, the last time party primaries were held in preparation for a special senate election. On Tuesday morning, no signs had surfaced indicating Galvin’s prediction would be incorrect.
At the Foley Apartments on H Street in South Boston’s waterfront, Democratic candidate and U.S. Rep. Stephen F. Lynch cast his vote shortly after 8 a.m, accompanied by his wife, Margaret. Recent polls show that Lynch trails his opponent, the veteran U.S. Rep. Edward J. Markey of Malden, by about 10 points. Lynch said last week that his own polling shows the race to be much closer, and that he believes he will win.
Speaking to reporters after casting his ballot Tuesday morning, Lynch echoed that optimism, saying that he expected to prevail despite predictions of low turnout, which experts said would likely benefit Markey, the better-funded and more party-line candidate of the two.
“I’m not worried about South Boston, but I’m worried about some other areas that don’t know us as well,” Lynch told reporters. “But this is my third [special election], and we’ve sort of figured out how to work these things, and I expect to win tonight.”
Only about 50 voters had made their way to the Foley Apartments by the time Lynch cast his ballot on Tuesday morning, though poll workers said they expected activity to pick up later.
One morning voter, Bob Chisholm, a cab driver from Dorchester, told The Crimson he was supporting Lynch. He said he has friends who had worked in construction with Lynch, a former ironworker whom he deemed “our kind of guy.”
“I ain’t a Markey guy, that’s for sure,” Chisholm said. “I told all my friends to vote, too.”
Still, Chisholm acknowledged that his candidate faced an uphill battle.
“The thing that might hurt Lynch is his vote on Obamacare, but hey, he stood to his principles,” Chisholm said, referencing the candidate's vote against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the landmark 2010 health care bill championed by President Barack Obama.
The issue has generated contentious debate in a campaign that has otherwise kept a relatively low profile. Markey voted yes on the legislation, and has called that vote “the proudest of my career.”
Both parties are holding modified open primaries, which allow independent registered voters to vote in either, but not both, of the races. Three Republicans—former U.S. Attorney Michael J. Sullivan, former Navy SEAL Gabriel E. Gomez, and State Rep. Daniel B. Winslow—are competing in the Republican primary. The polls close at 8 p.m.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON—Campaign volunteers across the Commonwealth made thousands of last-minute phone calls on Tuesday afternoon, urging registered voters to turn out for the special election primary before the polls close at 8 p.m. Voters are choosing the two candidates who will face off in a June 25 special election to fill the U.S. Senate seat vacated when Secretary of State John F. Kerry was appointed to the Cabinet.
In the Republican race, public polls have showed former Navy SEAL Gabriel E. Gomez and former U.S. Attorney Michael J. Sullivan contending for the party’s nomination, with State Rep. Daniel B. Winslow in third. On Monday, though, officials with the Winslow campaign said that their internal polling showed the three men in a dead heat.
At Winslow’s downtown Boston headquarters on Tuesday afternoon, volunteers dialed frantically and kept receivers pressed to their ears, reminding supporters to make it to the polls and attempting to coax those on the fence to vote for Winslow.
“I was calling to see if you had a chance to vote today,” the refrain went, followed shortly by variations of “Any chance you voted for Dan Winslow?”
The frenzied phone drive was hardly a new scene at the campaign’s Milk Street headquarters, according to Winslow.
“The phones have been my campaign,” Winslow said in an interview on Tuesday afternoon. “We knew from the beginning that we weren’t going to be able to raise money like [Gomez], so we engaged in asymmetrical political warfare.... We targeted a very narrow bandwidth of people, Republicans and Independents, that we think will vote.”
The Gomez campaign took in more than three times as much money as the Winslow campaign, the Boston Globe reported. In this environment, Winslow Political Director Matthew Cocciardi said, the Winslow campaign had concentrated its limited resources on talking to likely voters either over the phone or in person, rather than on costly television advertising, which is harder to target.
“Essentially, we did a live touch of every voter who is going to be voting today and talked to them about Dan, where he stands on issues, and why they should support him,” Cocciardi said. “Gabriel Gomez went about it in a different way, with large ad buys, trying to target everybody and then trying to make sure they went and voted. We went right to the voters.”
Late Tuesday afternoon, Cocciardi said the strategy looked to be working. Though he predicted that turnout across the Commonwealth would come up short of expectations—Cocciardi estimated that only about 115,000 would vote in the Republican primary, while on Monday Massachusetts Secretary of State William F. Galvin anticipated as many as 200,000 voters—he said that reports from Winslow’s hometown of Norfolk, as well as surrounding areas, were encouraging.
“If you look at the numbers for us, Dan’s home district is coming out and voting,” Cocciardi said. adding that turnout also looked strong in Gomez’s hometown of Cohasset. In Plymouth, where Sullivan once served as district attorney, Cocciardi said it had been a slow morning, but that turnout had picked up in the afternoon.
“Right now, I think it’s anybody’s game,” Cocciardi said, noting that the Republican victor may not be known for hours after the polls close.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Edward J. Markey, the veteran Democrat from Malden, grew a step closer to securing a seat in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday night as he defeated U.S. Rep. Stephen F. Lynch, his more moderate challenger, in the Democratic primary election. Gabriel E. Gomez, a former Navy SEAL from Cohasset, defeated two other candidates to secure the Republican Party’s nomination.
Markey topped Lynch by 14 points, 57 percent to 43 percent. He opens the campaign for the June 25 special election as a heavy favorite over Gomez, a 1997 graduate of Harvard Business School who won 51 percent of the vote in the Republican primary, easily defeating former U.S. Attorney Michael J. Sullivan and State Rep. Daniel B. Winslow.
But Markey, who has served in Congress for 37 years and has developed a loyal following in his suburban district, commanded the spotlight. As he thanked his supporters in a ballroom at the Omni Parker House Hotel in Boston, he was flanked on one side by his family and, on the other, by Democratic power players Senator Elizabeth Warren and Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley. After praising Lynch’s campaign, he turned his gaze to the race ahead.
“This election, ladies and gentlemen, will not be easy,” he told the crowd, warning that Super PACs, political influence groups that are not required to disclose their donors, were ready to descend on the Commonwealth to fund the Gomez campaign.
“Tonight, I call on the Republican nominee to keep the outside, undisclosed, unlimited special interest money out of this race,” he declared.
A frontrunner in the primary from the outset, Markey was buoyed by a slew of endorsements from influential Democrats, including Secretary of State John F. Kerry, the man who vacated the contested seat. Markey was also supported by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
On Tuesday, low voter turnout across the Commonwealth may have benefited Markey, who has enjoyed support from the reliable party faithfuls who composed much of Tuesday’s electorate.
But although experts agreed on Monday night that the deck appeared stacked against Lynch, on Tuesday morning, the South Boston congressman told reporters he was confident that he would win. Still, he admitted that he was worried about predictions of low turnout. After the polls closed at 8 p.m., it quickly became clear that, despite his strong, loyal base of constituents and union members, Lynch’s strongholds—blue collar cities like South Boston, Plymouth, and Brockton—would not produce enough ballots for him to pull through.
After the Associated Press called the race for Markey by around 9:15 p.m., Lynch phoned his opponent and pledged to throw his support behind the Malden congressman. Then, shortly after 10 p.m., Lynch addressed supporters assembled at a ballroom in Dedham.
“No one gave us a shot at this. Early on, they said, ‘Lynch is running a Braveheart campaign,’” Lynch said. Inviting laughter from the crowd, he added, “The only thing I didn’t like was that Braveheart gets killed in the end.”
Lynch then tried once again to rally his supporters, this time for Markey.
“Moving forward, the choice is now clear,” he said. “We start tomorrow united against the Republican nominee.”
Gomez is the son of Colombian immigrants and a more conservative Republican than former Senator Scott Brown, the last Republican to be elected to the Senate in Massachusetts. In his victory speech, he continued an effort to present himself as a fresh face, the antithesis of a long-tenured politician like Markey.
“I want to take you back in time,” he told his supporters, launching into a description of the year 1976, when Markey was first elected to Congress.
“That was a lifetime ago,” he told the crowd. “Me, I was just playing Little League baseball, and that was when Ed Markey first got elected to Congress.”
For the next two months, Markey and Gomez will continue to crisscross the state in an effort to gain support and endorsements in a race expected to attract national attention. Senator William “Mo” Cowan, former Chief of Staff to Gov. Deval L. Patrick ’78, has occupied the seat since January, when the governor appointed him interim U.S. Senator.

BOSTON, Mass.—In the middle innings of the Harvard baseball team’s Beanpot consolation game against Boston College at Fenway Park Monday afternoon, a number of Red Sox players went out to the right field warning track and played catch while the contest was still in play.
“I was just really excited that Major Leaguers were on the same field as me,” said sophomore starting pitcher Matt Timoney. “I didn’t care that it was in the middle of the game.”
But while the impromptu practice symbolized the fact that the professionals’ season continues on—even at the most inopportune moments—the Crimson’s own 2012-13 campaign was coming to an end, as Harvard (10-31) dropped a 7-2 decision to the Eagles in its final game of the year.
“Overall, we put out a good effort for our seniors, and that’s exactly what we wanted [to do],” freshman Mitch Klug said.
The Crimson pitchers were in trouble most of the day against the Eagles (9-35), who scored in six individual innings to finish in third place in the tournament.
With two outs in the top of the first, sophomore second baseman Tanner Anderson booted a routine ground ball, allowing one run to score before Timoney escaped a bases-loaded jam.
In the third, a two-out single to left by Jimmy Dowell put Boston College up, 2-0. The next inning, with runners on first and second following singles by Joe Cronin and Blake Butera, Timoney made a pickoff attempt to second base, but nobody was there to cover the bag. Cronin advanced to third as the ball rolled into center field, and John Hennesy singled through the hole on the right side to bring Cronin home before Timoney got Matt Paré to ground into a 6-4-3 double play to end the threat.
“Matt hasn’t been on the [mound] consistently in the last couple of weeks,” Crimson coach Bill Decker said. “[He was] a little rusty...but he gave it a good effort.”
Junior Peter Kaplan relieved Timoney and stranded three runners following three straight two-out walks in the top of the fifth, but he got back into trouble by hitting two batters in the sixth. With two outs once again, Matt McGovern hit a fly ball that sophomore Brandon Kregel misplayed near the jutting stands in right field, allowing both runners to score.
The Eagles added their sixth run on a Butera sacrifice fly in the seventh and their seventh run on a wild pitch by co-captain Jordan Haviland in the top of the ninth.
The Crimson, meanwhile, struggled to put together anything offensively for most of the afternoon.
In the fourth, Klug hit a one-hop double off the Green Monster in left, and two batters later, classmate D.J. Link singled up the middle to bring him home for Harvard’s first run. The Crimson scratched out another run in the bottom of the ninth when Kregel hit a sacrifice fly to center, but that would not be nearly enough.
Sophomore Mike Martin went 2-for-4 and junior Carlton Bailey finished 3-for-5 to raise their season batting averages to .287 and .277, respectively—good for second and third best on the team behind Kregel. But the Crimson was unable to turn those hits into runs.
“It’s been hard for us to get the bats going and get hits after hits,” Klug said.
Despite the loss, the team said the opportunity to play in one of baseball’s storied stadiums would be one they would never forget.
“It was just an unbelievable experience,” Timoney said. “I’ll remember it for the rest of my life.”
“When we look back on this season, despite everything that’s gone on, I think we will remember this as that one game [when] we came out and had fun,” Klug added. “It obviously didn’t go our way, but I think we’ll remember it as a great experience.”
Decker said the season finale finally brought some closure to a tumultuous season that witnessed the passing of former coach Joe Walsh.
“I’ve been doing this a long time, and this group of kids gave a pretty good darn effort day in and day out,” Decker said. “We certainly had a few bumps in the road, but I don’t think that this year should be measured by wins and losses alone.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Freshman Christine Lin’s final putt on the 18th hole gave her a one-under par 71 to secure the Crimson the Ivy team title by one stroke at Trump National Golf Course in Bedminster, N.J., on Sunday. The shot also forced a one-hole playoff for the individual Ivy title.
Harvard has now won the Ivy League Championships in back-to-back years, as it finished the tournament 45-over par to edge Princeton by a single stroke. Lin finished as the runner-up for the individual title after losing the playoff to Tigers junior Kelly Shon. The freshman also earned Rookie of the Year honors for her play this weekend.
Lin was the only golfer to shoot under par in the final round Sunday. Down two strokes to Shon coming into the final round, Lin birdied holes two, three, 12, and 13 on her way to a one-under-par round.
With both girls entering the final hole as the last group, the Crimson had a one-stroke lead over Princeton. However, because team scores consist of the lowest four scores added together for a team total, the golfers had no way of knowing the narrow advantage Harvard took into the final hole.
“Coming in as part of the last group, I had no idea where we stood as a team,” Lin said. “At the same time, I always play with the mentality that one shot can be the difference, so I was just making sure that I did my part and took my time.”
At the final hole, Lin and Shon would both bogey—securing the team victory for the Crimson and forcing the one-hole playoff between the two golfers. Shon, who earned Ivy League Player of the Year honors, and Lin played the par-4 18th hole one final time to determine the individual title, with Shon winning by a stroke.
Lin started the weekend strong with a one-over par 73 to pace Harvard in Friday’s first round. Lin garnered birdies on the par-three sixth hole and on the par-four 17th hole. Her 73 also tied her for second overall going into Saturday’s round two.
“Our coaches told us that we are going to have bad breaks,” the freshman said. “They just wanted us to believe in our game and commit to our shots. I was able to stay pretty calm throughout the rounds, and I just tried to stick to my game and what I have been working on.”
Though Lin’s second round 74 (+2) was her worst of the weekend, it still was the third-best score out of all golfers on Saturday and left her only two strokes off the lead.  Lin birdied the par-three second hole, the par-five 11th hole, and par-four 13th on the day. The freshman’s consistent play through the first two rounds gave her a chance to fight for the team title and the individual title in the final round on Sunday.
This past weekend marks the first time Lin has been the top golfer for the Crimson at an event all season, and the freshman’s success could not have come at a better time for the team. With the Ivy League win, Harvard earned an automatic bid to the NCAA Regional Championships. In addition to her Rookie of the Year honors, Lin was named to the All-Ivy League first team.
“I’m pretty happy that it all came together for me at this tournament,” Lin said. “I was struggling a little bit at the beginning of the semester, and I was worried I wasn’t going to play my best at the end of the season. I wasn’t expecting to end my freshman year playing so well, but I am really happy I did.”
For a freshman golfing in her first Ivy League Championship, Lin seemed unaffected by the pressure of Sunday’s final round with so much at stake. Lin shot her best round of golf on Sunday, and, with the season hanging in the balance, the freshman calmly sank her winning shot.
“If I had to pick one girl that really stepped up and helped us win this weekend, that would obviously be Christine,” said Harvard captain Bonnie Hu, who is also a Crimson business editor. “It is always tough to come in as part of the last group and have all the teams watching you finish. I think she did a great job handling the pressure that comes with the weekend and it showed in her level of play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard sailing team split up along the Charles River, as the Crimson competed in three regattas in the Boston area. Harvard picked up a sixth place finish at the 45th Women’s President’s Trophy Intersectional, hosted by neighboring Boston University. The Crimson also finished in sixth at the Friis and Marchiando Trophies, held at MIT. Wrapping up its weekend schedule, Harvard took fourth as it hosted the Central Series Three Regatta.
“We’re pleased that the team continues to improve,” head coach Michael O’Connor said. “In the team racing regatta at MIT, we qualified for the gold round, and we were happy with that. We were not able to qualify for the final four, which was sort of our next goal. But we’re getting closer and closer to the top teams with our very young team.”
It was the fourth straight weekend of competition for the Crimson. The team looked to capitalize on its success from last weekend, when Harvard notched a victory at the Ted Ferrarone Team Race.
“Overall, the results were relatively good [for this weekend],” sophomore Gram Slattery said. “I think we all showed a good amount of improvement from where we were just a few weeks ago. But [the results] also showed there’s work to be done.”
The Crimson went 6-8 at the intersectional regatta hosted by the Engineers, good for a sixth place showing in the 15-team field. Harvard opened the regatta with 5-2 records in both Round Robin events, advancing to the gold round. The Crimson posted victories against Boston College, MIT, Navy, and Michigan in both rounds. Harvard again finished with a 5-2 record in the first gold stage, but faltered to a 3-4 record in the second round.
“[It was] a very difficult team race,” Slattery said. “The first day, our communication was extremely good. We managed to knock off Boston College every time we faced them, and they’re ranked third or fourth in the country right now. The next day, we didn’t do quite as well. We made some silly errors. It’s about minimizing errors more than it is making plays, and unfortunately we just made a few too many errors.”
Yale took home first place with a 13-4 record on the weekend, edging out Boston College for the win. Stanford rounded out the top three at the event.
At the Central Series Three Regatta, Harvard posted 101 points to edge Brown University in a tiebreaker for fourth place. In the A division, juniors Ames Lyman and Jacquelyn Cooley notched one victory along with three second-place finishes and ended up with a total of 51 points. Senior Jinyan Zang and freshman Matthew Clarida, who is also a Crimson business editor, posted a second-place finish in one of their races en route their 50 point total.
Boston College came in first with a 62 point total, while Connecticut College picked up 73 points to finish in second. The MIT squad came in third with 93 points.
In the third and final regatta of the weekend, the Crimson’s 187-point total at the BU President’s Trophy just beat out Boston College for sixth place. In the A division races, juniors Morgan Russom and Caitlin Watson posted an 85-point total, while sophomore Asleigh Inglis and freshman Sophie Bermudez put up 102 points in the B division.
Yale won the regatta by a wide margin. The Bulldogs’ 66-point total was almost half that of second place finisher Tufts, which ended with 128 points. Roger Williams came in third, amassing 160 points on the weekend.
This weekend’s results mark the continuation of an upward trend for the Crimson. The team has steadily been on the rise the past few weeks, as the young squad gains experience from each weekend of competition.
“I think, over the course of the year, we came in with no one [who] could really perform at the intersectional level. It was really a struggle-fest,” Slattery said. “Now I think there are a bunch of skippers and crews that have really gotten a lot of confidence and have gotten a lot of good results too. At the beginning of the year, it was very intimidating. No one had a lot of experience at this level. We’ve gotten to the point where we know we can compete.”
Harvard looks ahead to another weekend full of competition, as the team will split up to tackle four regattas.
“We certainly had our struggles throughout the fall, but we continued to work at it,” O’Connor said. “We’ve done better working on our skipper-crew combinations in the spring. Everyone’s hard work is starting to show.”

Classes might end tomorrow, but you don't have to say goodbye to your favorite TF just yet. Building a friendship with a great TF can be exciting and rewarding, and—yes, this is cyincal—may even help you maintain that 3.7 GPA from your freshman fall.
Here are Flyby's Four Easy Steps to Befriending a TF:
Step One: The first step is to find out your TF's actual academic interests. Your TF probably has several sections, and might stay up well into the night editing papers she is completely uninterested in. Show that you care about your TF as an individual, not just as the person who will ultimately determine your grade. Pay close attention whenever your TF talks about something he is particularly interested in.
Step Two: Learn about their personal lives. This part is tricky, Harvard. You have to tread carefully so as not to overstep your bounds, but starting with questions about your TF's experiences at college and graduate school is usually a good move.
Step Three: Meet outside of section. Office hours might be an obvious place to begin, but you should also find out where your TF prefers to do her work. Make plans to talk about the final there instead, or just keep showing up there until you achieve a "coincidental" run in with him.
Step Four: Forge a concrete connection. A personal email address, a cell phone number, a Facebook friend request—it all gets you closer to the goal. Keep in mind that you might have to delete those tweets from Saturday night (and definitely those mobile uploads from Yardfest).
Throughout the process, ask yourself the following questions:
Does your TF seem comfortable talking about things that veer away from the syllabus?
Are you coming on too strongly? Do NOT try to force this friendship if it is not reciprocated.
Is your TF overwhelmed by other factors? Events like graduations, marriages, pregnancies, or hangovers could really hinder your progress.
How much does your brown-nosing annoy other students in your section? Keep your budding friendship on the DL, and try not to be a suck-up. Don't make it obvious you are being that guy.

No more all-nighters in the windowless concrete of the Science Center's computer lab just because your computer died.
Lamont and Cabot Library have 3-hour laptop loan programs, but now students whose laptops experience "hardware failures" have another option. They can borrow a Dell laptop and bring it back to their dorm room for 24 whole hours, thanks to a collaboration between the Undergraduate Council, HUIT, and Harvard College Libraries.
Michael C. George '14, the Student Life Chair of the UC, proposed the idea last semester after having trouble with his own laptop.
"It was motivated out of my own experiences with my own laptop because it just kept crashing at the worst possible moments—like when I had midterms or a paper due, I had to camp out in the Science Center Basement," George said.
The hours and policies of the loaner program may change in the future.
"It's in the pilot stage, and right now we want to see what the student demand is," George said.
While we don't recommend purposely crashing your laptop, be sure to take out a loaner Dell next time such an unfortunate event does occur, and remember that all is not lost—excpet your files, maybe.
