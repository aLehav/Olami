Roberto Bolaño once expressed disdain for magical realism as a literary style. Yet, in the latest collection of stories published posthumously by the acclaimed Chilean writer, Bolaño creates worlds that stretch far beyond the realms of reality. Unlike the Latin American writers he criticized, however, in “The Return,” Bolaño does not attempt to weave the magical into the mundane. He explicitly announces that his characters are dreaming, or that they are speaking from beyond death. What is more, his protagonists themselves are acutely aware of the fantastical framework of the worlds in which they are living. Although this consciousness on the part of his characters can at times be disorienting, he uses these imaginary worlds as a lens through which to understand reality more clearly.
In the title story, Bolaño’s character speaks as a ghost. The story begins with the protagonist witnessing his own death on the dance floor of a Parisian club, after which he follows his body to the morgue where he begins to get used to his ghostly state. Bolaño treats this death with a kind of lightheartedness; his character declares, “I had died, which always comes as a surprise, except, I guess, in some cases of suicide.” He even allows for the ghost to speak of the entire incident as a kind of inconvenience: “I was getting more and more bored.”
Yet the boredom does not last, as the ghost watches a famous fashion designer molest his dead body. But what would normally be a disturbing turn of events is complicated by Bolaño’s unusual choice to narrate the story from beyond death. That is, Bolaño allows for his protagonist to retain control, and even authority, during the completely submissive act of necrophilia, by locating the narrative voice in death—the ghost is even able to calmly reprimand the fashion designer that he “should be ashamed.”
Indeed, all of the short stories in Bolaño’s “The Return” take a kind of disorienting form. While some are framed by the world of a dream or the world beyond death, others are more stylistically unusual: a ten page story is one sentence long, another is written entirely in dialogue. In the very beginning of “Meeting With Enrique Lihn,” the protagonist states that he is dreaming the entire sequence of events. Again, as he does in “The Return” with death, framing the story in a dream might initially suggest a relinquishing of control and responsibility on the part of the characters, yet Bolaño continually endows his characters with the understanding of the framework of the dream.
The protagonist in “Meeting With Enrique Lihn,” is acutely aware that things in his dream do not make sense, a fact that he makes quite clear in his narration: “Of course I knew that Lihn was dead, but when they offered to take me to meet him I accepted without hesitation,” he says. Even Lihn seems to be aware of the unreality of the situation, as the narrator observes: “And at that moment I knew Lihn knew he was dead.” Bolaño is continuously creating these kinds of strange details, these unusual events, and then allowing for his protagonists to become aware and comment on their peculiarity. Later the narrator observes, while studying his surroundings within the dream, “After a while I reached the conclusion that something was wrong. If the floor of Lihn’s apartment was glass and so was the roof of the bar, what about all the stories from the second to the sixth?”
Because many of the stories in this collection are set in the realm of the fantastic, Bolaño is able to create a distance from the disturbing events he depicts. However, in the few stories in which his characters are not aware that they operating in a created world, the violence takes on a strikingly tangible nature. “Murdering Whores” consists of the monologue of a woman who tortures and eventually kills a Spanish soccer player. The entire story is in quotations, emphasizing the voice of the killer—the murdered man has no voice. Because this act of torture is not contextualized within a dream or an afterlife, it becomes all the more extreme. While in other stories, any disorder can be dismissed as part of an imaginary framework, here the reader is simply a witness to unexplainable, unreasonable violence. The lack of a clear motivation for the act—“It’s not something personal,” the torturer explains—only highlights its brutality.
When the protagonist of “Photos” observes, “at some point you stop knowing what you used to know,” Bolaño seems to be drawing attention to fiction’s ability to shift reality. But at the same time, he is also pointing out that even outside of fiction, violence can still shake our perception of the world, and it does so without the fictive—and protective—framework of dreams.

In an unusual tactic for a war documentary, the first minutes of “War Don Don” mix shocking archival footage and interviews with attractive courtroom photography and colorful scenes of Sierra Leone playing over an upbeat music track. Though it would be going too far to suggest that director Rebecca Richman Cohen HLS ’07 aestheticizes tragedy, one thing is immediately clear: CSPAN this is not.
“War Don Don” covers the trial of Issa Sesay, the commander of the Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone’s civil war, which ended in 2002. Sesay was convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity by the United Nations’ Special Court for Sierra Leone. The film presents the arguments made by the prosecution and defense, along with background about the civil war—which claimed 75,000 lives—and how the people of Sierra Leone continue to cope with the trauma and material damage to their country.
Although the film was made for HBO2, where it will air on September 29, Cohen intends it for African viewers as well, and has organized screenings in Freetown and other parts of West Africa. “It was important to us to reach out to both audiences,” Cohen explains. “[In Freetown,] I was taken aback by people’s reactions. There was a lot of laughter throughout the film.”
One such moment occurred when an investigator from Sierra Leone explains in an interview that the money being spent on the courts will go back to the developed countries that are funding them. “There were a lot of moments I thought were funny or ironic in ways that a Western audience wouldn’t understand,” she added.
Although the film gives equal time to the arguments of Sesay’s prosecution and defense, the attorneys for the latter tended to focus on the proceedings themselves in interviews. Before Cohen made “War Don Don,” she worked as a legal intern on the defense team of Alex Tamba Brima, one of Sesay’s fellow commanders.
Expressing sympathy for the defense’s arguments, she says, “I certainly agree that the practice could be made better. I think the prosecution might say that as well. I think both prosecution and defense think that holding leaders accountable for their crimes is really important. The question is the way in which we do it, and the way we might be able to improve it. I don’t believe anyone thinks this is a perfect process.”
However, Cohen says that the film is meant to help audiences understand the civil war and the trial and come to their own conclusions. “I don’t think there’s one takeaway,” she says. “The intention was to present different sides in a balanced way, as they would want to be represented. The purpose was to promote debate. Issa’s family screened the film, and he said it was very nice and he congratulated me on the effort. We made a film that both a convicted war criminal thought was accurate and important, and people on the prosecution have come out to support it and speak on our panels.”
Although law school may seem like an unconventional path to professional filmmaking, Cohen believes that it gives her a unique perspective on the medium and her subject matter. She had pursued film before attending Harvard, including working as an assistant editor on Michael Moore’s “Fahrenheit 9/11.” At the law school, she worked to get hands-on experience that would be conducive to filmmaking. “I went out into the world looking for experience, rather than doing film specifically,” she reflects on her early career.
Yet Cohen finds that documentary was the most appropriate medium to record the Sesay trial. “Law review articles, magazines, and news reports are all important,” she says, “but documentaries tell stories and can engage much broader audiences. All too frequently, people write off what’s happening in Africa as something very foreign and distant to us, and look at people who have participated in wars as being subhuman or demonic or something very different from what we know. But when you look closely, people look very human, and when you introduce that as a story in which people can understand the motivations, you have a chance at engaging people and addressing the root causes of why terrible crimes happen.”

In an early sequence in “Resident Evil: Afterlife,” Los Angeles smolders as a World War II-era plane flies above the tattered remnants of the Hollywood sign and other frayed remains of normalcy such as the scorched shells of cars which litter the streets and the skeletons of towering sky scrapers which dot the city. Such visually impressive sequences, however, prove to be the sole highlight of the film, the fourth installment in director Paul W.S. Anderson’s movies based on the video game series of the same name. Though “Resident Evil: Afterlife” packs an effects-laden punch with its adrenaline-soaked action scenes and special effects, the film comes up short in its acting, originality, and execution.
Alice (Milla Jovovich), the film’s genetically-altered protagonist, travels the world searching for survivors while seeking revenge for the evils perpetrated by the Umbrella Corporation. Her journey leads her to many visually appealing locations and allows for plenty of action; however, the film is hopelessly mired in a litany of unanswered questions and poor acting.
Visually, the film is definitely impressive.  Consistently gritty, the ambiance reliably conveys a post-apocalyptic world inhabited by the undead. The remnants of humanity struggle against both the overreaching and malevolent Umbrella Corporation, the company responsible for the viral outbreak, and the hordes of undead this viral pandemic produced, and both the barren, zombie-ridden wastelands and immaculately sleek corporate lairs visually echo this dichotomy. The film’s somber character is further enhanced by its soundtrack, which was composed entirely by tomandandy, the duo resonsible for scoring “The Hills Have Eyes.”  The film’s bass-heavy soundtrack is often one of its most striking features and contributes well to the movie’s dark atmosphere.
Despite its well-crafted world, which is further enhanced by the film’s 3D release, the character motivations of “Resident Evil: Afterlife” are shallow and inane. The dialogue often features overused clichés and clear attempts to spoon-feed both exposition and emotional growth to the audience as characters state such simplistic lines as, “I can’t do this much longer,” and, “Is this my punishment?” There appears to be no real impetus for Alice’s adventures, save a vague radio transmission requesting help and a desire to see her friends again. And unfortunately, the film’s wooden acting does such trite writing no favors.
Events in “Resident Evil: Afterlife” often occur haphazardly and leave more questions than they answer. Examples abound throughout the film of this shoddy scripting, notably the appearance of a goliath-sized zombie wielding a combination anvil-axe with which he tries to kill the small band of survivors; the existence of this creature is not explained whatsoever. Plot devices are often unexplained and require some knowledge of the previous films or the video game franchise for any understanding of the events which transpire. Although some attempts to explain past events are given in the form of flashbacks from previous films, these scenes often befuddle more than they help.
Also apparent is the film’s supreme lack of creativity. The film’s villain and owner of Umbrella Corporation, Alber Wesker (Shawn Roberts), looks like an identical twin of Agent Smith from the “Matrix” trilogy, from his slick black leather attire, to his sunglasses, to the over-large Desert Eagle handgun he carries. The film also makes extensive use of “Matrix”-like bullet time, in which the action slows to a bare crawl to allow every detail, explosion, and spark of the sequence to be witnessed from a constantly shifting perspective. This technique is used to such excess in the film that it appears as if more than half of the thankfully-brief running time seems to be played at slower than normal speeds.
Although entertaining and ambitious in its mood and atmosphere, the film, like its predecessors, often falters in its bland dialogue simplistic story. The result is visually rich with great action scenes, and yet remains mind-numbingly disengaging throughout. As an action film, “Resident Evil: Afterlife” can be fun, and some of its 3D-effects are eye-popping; however, the story is as brainless as the zombies who stumble aimlessly from scene-to-scene, much like the actors themselves.

Nobody was quite sure what to make of Joaquin Phoenix in the latter half of 2008. The award-winning actor, coming off a slew of critically-acclaimed performances in films like “Gladiator” and “Walk the Line,” announced that he was retiring from acting in order to focus on his hip-hop career. Over the coming months, Phoenix grew out his hair, gained weight, and was seldom seen aside from a few unfortunate public performances. On hand to capture Phoenix’s equally tragic and comic exploits on film was his brother-in-law, Casey Affleck, who has turned the tumultuous past couple of years into “I’m Still Here,” a riveting and humorous look at Joaquin Phoenix’s odd transformation.
Affleck deftly illustrates Phoenix’s feeling of being trapped as an actor in the film’s opening montage of archival media coverage, showing Phoenix using the same canned lines in interviews over and over. As Phoenix says in the first scene of original footage, “I don’t want to play the character of Joaquin anymore... Hate me or like me, just don’t misunderstand me.”
Soon after, Phoenix announces his retirement and his plans for a hip-hop career, to which the Hollywood community reacts with unanimous disbelief. From that point on, Phoenix slowly recedes into tragicomedy. Particularly baffling is the footage of the former actor standing in his homemade studio, mumbling laughably amateur lyrics to himself (“Times is crazy/Mothers be packing up their babies”). Following his first performance, Phoenix laments, “This is hard... There’s a lot of fucking judgment in this place.”
Yet despite his sad state, it is difficult to empathize with Phoenix. Footage shows him hiring prostitutes, snorting cocaine, and verbally abusing assistants. While debating which hip-hop mogul will produce his album, he causally claims, “Dre’s gonna be into it.” Phoenix slowly morphs into a slob with a beer belly and a scraggly, unkempt beard. He wears a surgical mask like a party hat for unexplained reasons, starts to refer to himself as JP, and tries to wax philosophical by posing questions such as “Do you think for a fly, wings are strictly a mode of transport?”
What makes “I’m Still Here” so darkly funny are the reactions that Affleck is able to capture in response to Phoenix’s behavior. The look on Mos Def’s face as Phoenix describes his project as a “hip-hop ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’” or Sean “Diddy” Combs’ stupefied expression as he listens to Phoenix’s demo tape and its refrain of the word “Compli-fuckin’-cation” are two truly hysterical moments.
Despite the frequent comedy, Affleck also provides an unflinching look at the dark side of Phoenix’s lifestyle. Backstage following his infamous, disastrous appearance on Letterman, Phoenix is left speechless. During the limo ride afterwards, he climbs out and breaks down, worrying that he’ll be considered a “fucking joke” forever. Phoenix’s torment at this stage in his reinvention is palpable.
Affleck’s portrait of a talented artist tortured by himself, the public, his peers, and the media climaxes with Phoenix performing in a Miami nightclub. As he begins to mumble his way through a halfway-decent beat, the club grinds to a halt. No longer is anyone dancing, but it appears as if everyone in the building has pulled out a cell phone or camera to capture the trainwreck. One of Affleck’s recurring visual motifs—that of Phoenix displayed on a large number tiny screens simultaneously—serves as an overt but stirring comment about our contemporary celebrity culture, one based largely on voyeurism and schadenfreude.
There has been a lot of public speculation about whether or not Phoenix’s retirement was a hoax. Quite frankly, it doesn’t matter. Regardless of whether Joaquin Phoenix is truly chasing his hip-hop dreams or if the whole thing is a work of conceptual art, “I’m Still Here” captures a celebrity during a major transition and attempted reinvention. It’s a blackly humorous, at times pitiable look at how Phoenix has turned himself into a walking punch line. Though it may seem paradoxical, career suicide could end up making Phoenix more famous than he had ever been before.

Real-life relationships between co-starring movie actors can go one of two ways. In 2005’s “Mr. and Mrs. Smith,” Brangelina set the screen on fire, and the sexual tension between the co-stars is so visible that their characters’ clothes-ripping, gun-shooting, knife-flinging sex scene is a welcome release for hot and bothered viewers. By contrast, Justin Long and Drew Barrymore (Drustin?) are uninspired and boring as on-screen lovers, and “Going the Distance” would probably be better if their characters spent less time unclothed and on top of each other in gratuitous sex scenes.
Long stars as Garrett, a soft New York City music executive who hates his job and never truly connects with his many girlfriends. Barrymore is Erin, a 31-year-old journalism intern in New York who once gave up her personal life in pursuit of love and now shies away from men. In typical romantic comedy fashion, the two meet one night at a bar—the same night Garrett gets dumped, of course—and make their way back to his place, where bongs, booze, and the “Top Gun” soundtrack somehow turn into the kind of sex that begins a six-week, whirlwind romance. When the time comes for Erin to return to her real home in San Francisco, the two are too attached to fully let go, and they decide to start down the difficult road of a long-distance relationship.
The movie’s premise is no more contrived than the plot of any rom-com, but the lack of chemistry between the two leads makes “Going the Distance” feel especially forced because they spend so much time apart. But maybe that’s the point; a relationship’s chemistry is harder to see and feel when the people involved are on opposite ends of the country. That being said, as viewers, it’s not enough to be told that the main characters are in love.  There needs to be more justification than cheesy on-screen texts and sneezing panda YouTube videos to explain why the couple’s every meeting begins with airport-novel-worthy sex that only gets more tiresome as the movie drags on.
Luckily for Barrymore and Long, there’s a fantastic supporting cast to distract from their uninspired romance as Garrett and Erin. Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis are hilarious as Garret’s best friends Dan and Box, respectively. It’s not just that they have better lines—“You cut your own hair and suck your own dick? You’re like a Swiss army knife!” says Box to Dan—but rather that they bring energy to the film that Long sorely lacks unless he is on screen with them. Similarly, the underutilized Christina Applegate is a fantastic blend of neuroticism and overprotectiveness as Erin’s older sister Corinne. Her straight face when discussing the dangers of dry-humping with Barrymore is priceless, as is her resigned disgust toward cleaning up the messes of her sister’s frequent sexcapades.
The sex scenes in “Going the Distance” are hands-down the worst part of the movie, worse than Barrymore’s whiny and implausible portrayal of an irresponsible woman burned by love, and worse than the generic indie-pop music soundtrack that tries to direct viewers’ every emotion. The most repulsive moment comes when the family is eating dinner on the table that was a previous scene of one of Drustin’s sexual encounters. One of the dinner guests drops corn on the table, and as it rolls around it picks up leftover body fluids before it is eaten. The scenario is disgusting, unnecessary, and completely out of place.
The reason, perhaps, that the director has to resort to scenes like this to encourage laughter is that there is minimal entertainment in watching Barrymore and Long act out a surprisingly unconvincing relationship. Moments of true brilliance, like Long’s spray-tan incident and Barrymore’s drunken bar outburst, are forgotten in a mix of distasteful phone sex, awkward dry-humping, and crass puns regarding restaurant tips and penis tips. If Drustin had even one-half of the sexual tension and chemistry in “Going the Distance” as Brangelina did in “Mr. and Mrs. Smith,” the movie could have been brilliant. Without that chemistry, the film stands as yet another flop in Drew Barrymore’s extensive resume of mediocre romantic comedies.

While Christa Assad switched to majoring in the arts after initially enrolling in Pennsylvania State University to pursue a degree in aerospace engineering, she only discovered her passion for ceramics in one of the last classes she took to fulfill her undergraduate requirements. Since then, she has developed a novel kind of pottery that most describe as streamlined and modern, a style that also pulls from her varied interests in early life. Assad, along with other contemporary potters, is bringing into the modern world an art form that dates back nearly 20,000 years.
Assad is also integrally involved with numerous pottery groups that are promoting the reintroduction of handmade ceramics in one’s daily life through programs like Art-Stream, which has a lending library of artists’ ceramics that the public can take home and enjoy for a week. She is California-based but teaches classes all over the country to promote ceramics and pottery. This weekend on September 18 and 19, she will be demonstrating her unique style with a two-day workshop presented by the Ceramics Program to instruct students on the basics of throwing clay on the wheel as well as techniques to create modern ceramic masterpieces of their own.
The Harvard Crimson: How would you describe your style of ceramics work?
Christa Assad: I guess what distinguishes my style is the real industrial, urban aesthetic to it, which has been called postmodern and, I guess, not as pottery-like. My current work is even bordering on objects that aren’t functional. The style to me is showing itself as being more about mimicking other materials, maybe metal, concrete, things like that. My style is always called industrial or urban, but it always plays homage to concrete and metal and larger-scale structure.
THC: What was the idea behind your upcoming show at the Ferrin Gallery in Pittsfield, Massachusetts?
CA: Residual pails. The theme is about memory traces and old buildings and old objects that don’t have a use anymore. The theme is very closely centered around this one object, an old wood burner from the Pacific Northwest logging industry where they incinerated all the old logging waste. I did a whole series on those buildings which are just amazing looking buildings. They’re all kind of skeletal and coming down now on the west coast but people love looking at them.
THC: How does teaching ceramics help your artistic development?
CA: I’m always surprised at how insightful people can be in a [learning] situation like that where they don’t know much about me, but through that kind of intense contact for two days people will say stuff about my work or my way of being that’s really helpful because they’re people I don’t know that are not afraid to say things. It’s helpful to have an objective and fresh opinion on my work.
THC: What do you hope to gain from the experience of teaching a workshop at Harvard?
CA: I’m really excited to see the program, because in ceramics it’s really exciting to visit other studios, look in the facilities. I didn’t realize Harvard had a ceramics program so that’s kind of a reason in it’s own right to see what the program is all about. I know of the woman who teaches there, Kathy King, and I’ve been excited to meet her; she has a fabulous reputation. So I hope to gain the perspective into what advantages to the academic aspect there may be to that program over some schools that don’t stress academics as much as they stress art theory or art practice or whatever it might be. I’d like to get an understanding about what Harvard offers when dealing with ceramics.
THC: What is the future of ceramics?
CA: I’m really hopeful. I think that the future for potters in particular is looking brighter because of, actually, the downfall of the economy. It worked in their favor. I think that lower priced art items—unfortunately like pottery can be—are now things that people are more willing to spend their money on. I think the movement of buying more locally is definitely in favor of the potter also. Ceramics as a bigger field has the possibility to join with the art world instead of being separated out. Something I’m interested in doing is to question why we ban together as clay artists and potters and can’t just say we’re artists. We need to stop the battle of segregating our own selves into this little tiny field. I’d rather join in the bigger picture and make more of a statement with the whole art world.
THC: What do you want people to take away from your ceramics?
CA: I would like people to take an appreciation for finer details and the sort of a realism that can be expressed through something so malleable and thought of as a floppy and muddy material. I want them to really see that clay can be so fine, so well-crafted, that it can surprise you.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: September 14, 2010
An earlier version of the Sept. 14 arts article "Portrait of an Artist" referred to Christa Assad's show at Ferrin Gallery as "Residual Pails." The correct name is "Vestigial Tales."
The same article also called a program "Arts Dream" instead of its correct name of "Art-Stream."

As we dust ourselves off and get up again after the gloomy, anxious years since 2001, literary writers have hurried to the presses with attempts to interpret what just happened. Don DeLillo, Ian McEwan, Dave Eggers, and Allegra Goodman have all released novels attempting to pin down the past decade’s malaise, but their efforts have thus far lacked the scope and ambition to create a recognizable portrait of the era. These writers focus on a particular aspect of those years—September 11, Hurricane Katrina, the ascendancy of the Internet—but fail to capture what it was to live in it. Yet if any writer is qualified to succeed where others have failed and reconcile us with the Bush years, it is Jonathan Franzen. His earlier works galloped across locations, decades, and social classes, delivering heaping servings of life.
The application of Franzen’s observational skills to the very recent past is perhaps the greatest achievement of “Freedom,” a formidable novel that teems just as richly as his previous work. By any objective measure of literary quality, “Freedom” is an exquisite machine: its satire is funny and incisive, its plot perfectly paced. Franzen skates past the aspects of fiction that trip up lesser writers: the sex scenes in “Freedom” do not bore; the political references seem natural. And yet it is a machine. While an unassuming humanism underlied Franzen’s earlier work, the characters and places of this novel seem subordinate to his coldly rational exploration of space and independence in modern America.
Walter Berglund lurks at the center of this expansive novel, and his faltering marriage and increasingly extreme environmental activism provide the framework for its loose plot. He is one of the best illustrations of Franzen’s skillful and ruthless approach to his characters—Walter is a father and the director of a conservation fund; he is rational, misanthropic, and also very good. It is a testament to the manipulative power of Franzen’s writing that although he dwells on Walter’s wretched youth, the love and patience with which he treats his family, and his sincere and laudable convictions, the only emotions he evokes are pity and contempt.
And so it is with each of the characters in “Freedom.” These people have bizarre habits and memorable voices; they are as carefully detailed as porcelain dolls that are meant to be admired but not played with. Franzen has skillfully created a population of grotesques, but his contempt for his own characters is untempered by sympathy. It is perhaps the only way to write a novel as intellectually ambitious as “Freedom,” and in no way does it undercut the quality or the satisfaction of the book. However, it does explain the impression that Franzen’s universe is governed not by human emotion but by clockwork.
At least one of the characters, the perceptive and prodigal son Joey Berglund, notices that something is amiss: when his life becomes dreary and lonely after the September 11 attacks, he believes that “the culprit, in hindsight, seemed almost like bin Laden but not quite. The culprit was something deeper, something not political, something structurally malicious.” But the most obvious structural malice in “Freedom” comes from Franzen himself, and his single-minded determination to create a perfect, tidy tragedy.
“Freedom” is a novel about space—each of its characters labors under the quaintly American notion that enough physical distance will resolve any problem, from Joey’s clingy girlfriend to the extinction of the cerulean warbler, the Appalachian songbird that Walter dedicates himself to preserving. Of course, Franzen’s characters run but they never successfully hide, and each subplot turns on the characters’ decisions to stop running and sacrifice freedom for responsibility. As each one does this, he or she is duly rewarded with a happy ending, and the characters march in lockstep towards this destiny. The single character who never gives up on freedom’s grandiose allure is smote by an angry deus ex machina. David Foster Wallace won attention and support when he advocated “passionately moral fiction,” but one doubts that Franzen’s Old Testament moral absolutism was quite what Wallace had in mind.
It is strange that, given Franzen’s preoccupation with the idea of space, he remains quite unconcerned with place. Walter and Patty Berglund move from St. Paul to Washington, D.C. in the novel, but beyond physical descriptions and ‘red’/’blue’ state stereotypes, both of these settings are oddly flat. St. Paul seems like particularly rich grist for Franzen’s mill, but it is ultimately reduced to a generic liberal subdivision where stay-at-home mothers while away “afternoon[s] of public radio, the Silver Palate Cookbook, cloth diapers, drywall compound, and latex paint, and then Goodnight Moon, and then zinfandel.” If Franzen’s earlier novels were like films shot on location, “Freedom” unfolds against a painted backdrop.
Franzen has been hailed for resurrecting the social novel, but there was a reason it fell out of favor in the first place. His 2001 National Book Award-winning novel “The Corrections” showcased for contemporary readers the most appealing aspects of social realism: a sprawling collection of characters, ample opportunity for satire, and a rollicking narrative substantial enough to be at once bawdy and beautiful; uncomfortable and heartbreaking. “Freedom” expands on this template, and in doing so reveals the obtuse side of contemporary realism. Franzen’s players, though gorgeously rendered, are mere variables in what amounts more to a social and moral calculus than a novel.

Luckily for Jukebox the Ghost, there is a robust societal demand for music on the sunny side of pop mediocrity. What better music is there for hosting casual get-togethers, taking drives on sunny days through the countryside, or providing soundtracks for Sundance films?
It’s not that “Everything Under the Sun” is a particularly bad album, but rather that it sounds like nice background music, a comfortable amalgamation of Top 40, indie pop, and contemporary adult that you might hear in Urban Outfitters. Every song sounds like something else that’s already been done, from “Summer Sun,” which echoes Elton John’s “Benny and the Jets,” to “Mistletoe,” whose melody occasionally sounds like an inverted version of The Dixie Cups’ classic, “Chapel of Love.”
Granted, it does take a good deal of skill to construct generally inoffensive music. The album’s instrumentation, a skillful blend of piano and guitar pop stylings, is friendly and smile-inducing, with chiming chords, slick production, and an overall buoyant feel. It still comes across, however, as Ben Kweller meets The Hush Sound meets The (old) Killers meets Plain White T’s, which is to say uninspired, or perhaps overly inspired.
Perhaps the album is at its best when regarded as background music, a nice blend of pleasant sounds with catchy hooks and fleeting moments of brilliance. When listening closely, however, “Everything Under the Sun” changes from irresistibly likeable to mildly grating.
It’s hard to decide which is more annoying: the lead singers’ voices or the lyrics, which alternate between trite and pretentious. “So Let Us Create,” the album’s slow-tempo ballad, is crucified by a swooping falsetto probably intended to evoke romantic nostalgia. It fails at that, but does invoke a desire to press the skip button, especially in combination with underwhelming lyrics such as “So let us create what we need each other to be / And I’ll be what you need for me to be.” Similarly, “The Stars,” which has the whiniest, most nasal vocals on the album, is unfortunately saddled with the lyric: “What if we were created to gaze at the stars up above?”
Even songs with non-irritating vocals have irritating lyrics. “The Sun” is pleasantly smooth, with no forays into whininess or falsettos, but opens with “Everything under the sun is getting burned / everything under the moon is gonna sleep.” What illuminating observations!
To be fair, not all of the songs are lyrically lacking. “Schizophrenia,” the album opener, is an interesting journey into, well, schizophrenia, and served as mainstream America’s introduction to Jukebox the Ghost when it was featured on “Letterman” on September 1. The lyric “Here they come / here they come / they’re after me” fits perfectly with the jangling opening and the overall frenzied feeling. The closing song, “Nobody,” is perhaps the cleverest song on the album, taking advantage of the many possible ways in which to deconstruct the word “nobody” with various meanings: “Oh you got a place for your body when you got nobody at all / and while you’re up in the clouds / don’t you feel like you’ve left your body / ‘cause you’ve got no body?”
In a word, “Everything Under the Sun” is mediocre. It’s not groundbreaking or terribly bad; it just sort of is, in the way that sophomore albums by previously little-known indie pop bands are. Jukebox the Ghost may just be another casualty of popularity, considering that their first album, “Let Live and Let Ghosts,” was much, much more sparklingly original than this one. If the market for mediocre pop continues to grow the way it has been, however, Jukebox the Ghost should be just fine.

It is something remarkable that Robert Pollard, of the Guided by Voices fame, still crafts interesting music. One of the great economical songwriters, he has built a sprawling discography from just a handful of guitar chords and well-worn rhythms. And we are not talking about a triumph of quantity over quality here—Pollard has to his name some of the great albums and songs of the last twenty years. Moreover, there is no Robert Pollard formula as there is for AC/DC or The Ramones. Sure, his music falls around the intersection of punk, folk, and classic rock, but that would be a reductive generalization. Hinging largely on Pollard’s versatile vocals—think Roger Daltrey with the bombast dialed down—his songs are in some instances rousing, in others contemplative, and in still others simply bizarre. All that said, the question that a veteran songwriter like Pollard poses to the listener is this: to what degree can he still be inspired and compelling?
With 2010’s “Our Cubehouse Still Rocks,” Pollard gives us yet another chance to weigh the evidence. His new band, Boston Spaceships, is something of an indie rock super-group. Chris Slusarenko, the band’s bassist, played with Pollard in Guided By Voices, whose 1994 release
“Bee Thousand” is considered one of best albums of the 90s. The band’s drummer, John Moen, is likewise no stranger to critical acclaim, being a member of the folk rock group The Decemberists. The three band members make, in many ways, the music you would expect. The feel is distinctly Pollardian—garage rock immediacy tinged with the ethereal. The album is, however, uncharacteristically inconsistent. There are some gems scattered about, but some insignificant numbers as well. That makes for a worthy addition to the Pollard oeuvre, but nothing to dot this millennium’s best-of lists.
The album begins with the competent opener “Track Star,” which, while not among the record’s best, does evince one of the its strengths: the coherent vision of each song. “Our Cubehouse Still Rocks” is largely written by Pollard, and there is a skillful unity among the elements that comprise the music. “Track Star” begins with a steady acoustic guitar riff punctuated with booming down strokes from a second axe. Underneath, a metronomic snare beats away at half-speed—just constant enough to make the listener slightly uncomfortable. Here, the instruments all work towards a common purpose—to evoke in the listener the titular protagonist’s baseline anxiety.
Pollard maintains this tight composition throughout the album. The kinetic closing song, “In the Bathroom (Up ½ The Night),” is among the record’s best. Pollard’s unique and inspired songwriting makes this track a rare gem that rocks hard even when played softly. Quite strikingly, there is no steady drum beat during the opening verse. Instead, Moen is locked in rock solo mode, providing smatterings of percussion on impulse. Then, the guitars cut out as the drums break into a beat that slowly winds down as if the recording tape were melting. All of a sudden, the guitars surge back with the drum beat resurrected at full tempo, ushering in the song’s exhilarating chorus. As with the album’s opener, Pollard uses instrumental interplay to craft music that moves.
It is during the more subdued songs that the album’s momentum flags. To be sure, a few of the record’s laid-back numbers are its highlights. With its majestic one-note chorus, falling in and out of harmony with the pounding guitar riff underneath, “Unshaven Bird” is a dramatic ballad of sorts. Nonetheless, the less urgent songs tend to fall prey to Pollard’s predilection for lethargic, spacey moods. In “Dunkirk is Frozen,” the monotonous vocals are drenched in reverb, blending into the fuzzed-out ether of the guitar. Though the song succeeds in creating the stoned mood it targets, it lacks the edge needed to keep the listener’s focus.
The problem posed by these uninspiring songs is compounded by the album’s organization. Pollard’s songwriting on “Our Cubehouse Still Rocks” expresses itself along two contrasting poles. On some tracks, Pollard’s poppy melodies break through the lo-fi haze of his guitar work. In others, his melodies drone, fading into the musical backing. Had the latter songs been interspersed with the former, a redemptive dynamic may have been established. However, as the album is sequenced, Pollard’s shoegazing numbers are bunched into sleepy suites.
Nonetheless, “Our Cubehouse Still Rocks” is, when taken as a whole, a solid album from a great artist. Here’s to hoping, though, that Pollard’s next effort will have the energy to carry all of his strenghts.

“Ah, you want some pineapple?” asks the Emcee (Amanda Palmer) of an audience member in the American Repertory Theater’s (A.R.T.) “Cabaret.” Her inquiry turns out to be more of a command than a question, however, as she pushes a piece of pineapple on a fancy toothpick towards her chosen receiver. “It’s vegan,” she exclaims with a giggle. “Yay, interactive theater!”
“Cabaret,” which runs until October 30 at OBERON, forces audience members to enter a world that at first glance might seem like a far cry from the streets outside. It’s self-aware and understands the possibility for theater to become removed from the patrons it entertains, while still feeling emotionally relevant. However, director Steven Bogart and his artistic team avoid simply contemporizing the action and instead take more innovative and less literal risks, incorporating mirrors which reflect the audience, clever staging, blinding spotlights, and a bold but astute Emcee.
The show quite literally invites its audience to enjoy a night at the Kit Kat Klub, complete with table seating that features drink delivery and a rousing game of “Never Have I Ever” led by Kit Kat Klub members before the show even begins.
Set in 1931 Berlin, “Cabaret” centers on the world of the indulgent Kit Kat Klub as it becomes intertwined with the world outside, which hangs in delicate balance on the brink of World War II. Star singer Sally Bowles (Aly Trasher) meets American writer Cliff Bradshaw (Matt Wood) one night, and romance soon follows. As the war draws closer, Sally, Cliff, and the others must decide how or if to acknowledge the unrest building outside the Klub’s walls.
Bogart shies away from little, with dildos (sometimes sequined), pasties, and a general lack of clothing proving commonplace. He even reinserts the often-omitted line, “She wouldn’t look Jewish at all,” into the song “If You Could See Her,” despite past productions’ hesitations that it could appear anti-Semitic. Following the A.R.T.’s pension for non-traditional theater, the action skillfully utilizes all corners of the theater, from the balcony and the bar in the rear of the black box to the actual tables of the audience itself.
Palmer, a Boston local perhaps best known as half of the Brechtian punk cabaret duo The Dresden Dolls, guides this action forcefully and impeccably with a conversational and personal air. She slides off stage quietly only to appear full force for numbers such as “Money” and the almost cinematically-staged “I Don’t Care Much.” Her character is deliciously androgynous—thanks to the imaginative and tantalizing costuming by David Isarael Reynoso—clad in laced up combat boots and suspenders, her breasts bound down with ivory cloth.
Although her accompanying Kit Kat Klub members easily could have turned into outlandish one dimensional background caricatures, they become intriguing members of the show through their amusingly riotous and debaucherous numbers. Each member commits wholeheartedly to developing his or her own unique character.
Unfortunately, but nevertheless enjoyably, the lavishness of the Klub and Palmer’s dominating, yet welcome presence often force the other plotlines into the background. This one-sided focus brings about less flashy numbers such as “Marriage” and also glosses over the romance between Bowles and Bradshaw.
Yet, owing to the strength of the Kit Kat ensemble as well as mirroring the growing chaos of the impending war, the two stories become increasingly intertwined. This is especially evident as the Emcee and Kit Kat Klub members lounge on chairs and interject one-line quips into scenes between other members of the cast.
While it might be hard to compete with Palmer in a role that seems almost made for her, Trasher makes a magnificent Sally Bowles. She blends a perfect cocktail of innocence, eagerness, and despair, culminating in a moving rendition of the song “Cabaret,” wherein she peels off her eyelashes and knocks the microphone over in a moment that could have easily become melodramatic if done poorly.
Avoiding the trap many popular musicals fall into, Bogart never allows the production to become too predictable or simplified. He has given the show a desirable and unique blend of humor and haunting beauty without touching the realm of overdone.
The show ends with Palmer standing almost nude in a spotlight as members of the nearly-naked ensemble twist grotesquely in doorways on either side of the stage. As the cast takes their bows in simple white robes, they seem little different than they have the whole show: fanciful, but strangely real people. In that culminating moment, it becomes clear that Bogart has succeeded in turning “Cabaret” into an interactive and indulgent, though incredibly sincere, experience.

The best tunes by Portland indie-punk outfit The Thermals are defined by their tempo. Early highlights like “No Culture Icons,” from their 2003 debut “More Parts Per Million,” have a chugging intensity, and sound like the band members are consciously restraining themselves from playing 20 or 30 beats per minute faster. The Thermals’ songs are actually a good deal slower than many of their punk contemporaries, but the barely-restrained frenzy of their first three albums complemented their politically-oriented lyrical venom.
During their recent career, the band has moved away from the themes that previously gave their music its drive, and their new album “Personal Life” feels like a culmination of that change. 2009 release “Now We Can See” was The Thermals’ weakest yet, as the band seemed to outgrow the ferocity that was their best quality. Political messages were watered down or eliminated and band members were suddenly perfectly content to play at a more moderate pace. If this shift, which might be due to the mellowing effects of age, had been accompanied by some development in style or tone, “Now We Can See” could have been a graceful maturation for The Thermals. Instead, the group followed the formula of their previous three albums, but without their urgency—a critical flaw. Listening to “Now We Can See,” for long-time Thermals fans mostly just resulted in an urge to listen to earlier, better material instead.
Thus, the question for their fifth effort, “Personal Life,” is whether the band can complete their difficult transition from angry young punks to sophisticated adult alt-rockers. The opening track “I’m Gonna Change Your Life” does not bode well for this objective, beginning with an unhurried three-chord guitar line, which ambles rather than propels. “I’ll keep you warm at night,” lead singer Hutch Harris moans plaintively in the verse, yet “I’m Gonna Change Your Life” has little of the raw emotion that characterized earlier Thermals albums.
Many of the songs on “Personal Life” seem stuck in limbo. Neither vitriolic punk nor fully-fledged rock, they combine elements of both, and the most frequent result of this amalgamation is a peculiarly limp version of the former. “Only For You,” best described as a punk ballad, exemplifies the album’s existential confusion, mashing the band’s newfound interest in romantic themes with a decelerated, thumping drum-and-bass background which is at odds with the song’s subject matter. Other similarly premised songs, like “Your Love Is So Strong,” suffer from the same disconnect. The Thermals’ ideas have evolved but their music has been left behind—and they seem unable to muster up the same passion about their titular personal lives as they did about corrupt governments and unfair gods.
Fortunately, The Thermals still have their knack for beguiling instrumental hooks. This skill redeems tunes like “Never Listen To Me,” an uncomplicated, riff-driven number which strips down the band’s sound to its basic components: one or two memorable guitar lines and Harris’s distinctive yowls. The best tracks on “Personal Life” all take this back-to-basics approach—the punk aesthetic minus the punk sound.
Listening to “Now We Can See” elicits nostalgia for the noisier, angrier Thermals of old. “Personal Life” is even more frustrating, combining that same nostalgia with a sense of unrealized potential in tracks like lead single “I Don’t Believe You,” in which spacious guitars back one of Harris’ most heartfelt vocals: “Say you’re going through a phase / you’re just acting your age / I don’t believe you.”
In “Personal Life,” The Thermals take tentative steps away from their roots with four-plus chord progressions and distortion-free riffs. But instead of defining a new sound for themselves, they land somewhere between the straightforward punk of their earlier albums and a dated rock sound that evokes 90s groups like Built to Spill. “Personal Life” is listenable but uninspiring, which for a once provocative, affecting punk band, is a harsh indictment.

While most people visit the Loeb Drama Center to see theatrical works, this December audiences will have the unique opportunity to view a visual art exhibit as well. In preparation for the American Repertory Theater’s (A.R.T.) new musical play “The Blue Flower,” co-creator Ruth Bauer will lead students in a series of workshops to create an art installation in the lobby of the Loeb.
Bauer, a Rhode Island School of Design-trained visual artist, will be working at Harvard as part of the Office for the Arts at Harvard’s (OFA) Learning from Performers program. Co-sponsored by Harvard Art Museums and Adams House, the program gives students the chance to interact with professional artists across a range of disciplines through master classes, workshops, and informal meetings. Bauer hopes to have approximately twenty students participating in the workshops, the first of which takes place on October 27th, preceded by an informal informational meeting on September 15th.
Bauer’s own work focuses on painting and collages. “The Blue Flower,” which she has been working on for a decade, is her first theatrical production. The show has been performed several times before its A.R.T. debut, but this production allows for more full-scale facets. “Different incarnations have happened along the way, but [staging the show] at A.R.T. is our first opportunity on a large stage, with all the elements in place,” she says. Adding to the novelty of the undertaking, the art installation is Bauer’s first project with Harvard students.
This installation will serve as a visual introduction to “The Blue Flower,” created by Bauer and her husband Jim. The play follows the trajectory of a handful of German artists on their journeys through pre-war Paris, the battlefields of Verdun, Weimar Germany, and finally New York. The Bauers describe the play as “a Dada inspired romp down the twisted rails of history.” Many of the central characters are loosely based on personalities associated with Dada, an anarchistic artistic and cultural movement that reached its peak between 1916 and 1922.
Artists Franz Marc, an expressionist painter killed at Verdun, and Kurt Schwitters, whom Bauer calls the “presiding spirit” of the play, serve as the inspiration for the male characters. The female characters are inspired by Hannah Höch, a proto-feminist and pioneer of photomontage, and scientist Marie Curie. But Bauer insists that “The Blue Flower” is not a historical play. “It departs from truth in all ways; Emily Dickinson’s line ‘Tell all the truth, but tell it slant’ is our motto,” she says.
“In spite of the serious subject matter of World War I...[the play’s tone] is irreverent,” Bauer says. “The way the whole piece is constructed as a collage is in the spirit of Dada.” The Loeb installation aims to reflect this multimedia format.
To better understand the Dada aesthetic, Bauer will take students to view objects in the Busch Reisinger collection, temporarily located in Somerville, in mid-October. Students will have the chance to view original artwork from the period, including etchings by Max Beckmann, collages by Hannah Höch, and other contemporary material, such as an almanac of which Franz Marc was editor. The curator of the collection will talk about the historical significance of the objects, while Bauer will comment on them from the perspective of an artist.
Bauer anticipates that students will use work from the period to inform their ideas for the installation. “My hope... is that it will be a lot of assemblage, 3D work, and relief work,” she says. The A.R.T. has even given her license to take down existing posters and fixtures to help achieve her vision. “The A.R.T. is very excited about letting me create an environment in the lobby that [will signal to] audiences that they are in a different universe right away,” she says.
In keeping with the spirit of Dada artists, who had limited resources during and after the First World War, Bauer intends to use as much recycled material as possible to create the installation. She has been collecting lumber, scraps, found objects, paper, and cardboard to use alongside other media. Audience members will also be able to make their own additions on one wall, so that the work will continue to develop during the course of the show. The project will combine visual and theatrical art in innovative ways, allowing for a new kind of theatergoing experience. As Bauer says, “I can totally take over the space.”

New York band Interpol had worked themselves up to a near-legendary status in the indie rock world by the time of the release of their third album in 2007. However, with their fourth, oddly self-titled LP, something has gone wrong—loss of interest, biting off more than they could chew, who knows—and things could not be worse. Filled with ten inappropriately long tracks with the same slow, uneventful ennui, “Interpol” blurs together into a 45 minute-long, painful let-down.
This is not to say that Interpol don’t deserve credit for what they have recorded. It is plain to see that much effort was put into creating a darker sounding, more melodic and perhaps more mature and developed album. However, if this dry collection indeed is the result of maturation, I would recommend to Interpol the option of retirement.
On their website, they put it into their own words: “The four of us poured our collective heart into this music and we are very proud and excited to share it. It’s a heavy record.”
They are absolutely right—but it’s too heavy perhaps. So many tracks are bogged down with low octave bass lines and guitar riffs that drag from measure to measure without changes in tempo or melody. They sound cool at first, but by the second minute, you are skipping to the next song without thinking twice. “Lights” is a case in point. It begins with a two-measure bass lick, which repeats for five and a half minutes. The monotony is joined intermittently with drums and a mimicking guitar, but neither gives much of a kick to bring the track to life. Every attempt to resuscitate the sound fails, miserably. Here lies Interpol.
Unlike previous albums, filled with single-worthy tracks that could be played alone with satisfaction, “Interpol” tries to emphasize the idea of the big picture. However, once you listen to the ten tracks, you become numb and accustomed to the feel of the album. Worse yet, most tracks are incapable of standing on their own; the second the listener takes it out of context, its flaws stand out strongly.
“Interpol” also fails to take advantage of the vocals of Paul Banks. Banks offers arguably one of the most unique sounds of any alternative rock lead singer. In Interpol’s previous albums, this was used as an asset to better their sound. Now, however, with few fast-paced choruses or energetic verses, his voice does not have the ability to speak for itself. It is muddled by the groggy sound that surrounds it, and sadly just blends in with the monotonous tracks.
The high point of “Interpol” is the song “Try It On,” which stands as the only success in the band’s apparent efforts at a new sound. With a honky-tonk piano riff and whistling accompanying a progressively fast-paced song, Banks’s vocals can stand out, joined by backing vocalist and guitarist Daniel Kessler. It ends with some electronic tones and beeping. Unfortunately the same cannot be said of “Success,” which is anything but, as it is filled with the same unenergetic tempo and boring melodies as the surrounding tracks. “Barricade” is most similar to tracks from “Antics,” their 2004 album, such as “Slow Hands” or “Evil,” which makes it enjoyable in and of itself. Unfortunately, it seems out of place alongside the “heavy” tracks that it lies between.
Interpol presents us with an all-or-nothing album that is for all intents and purposes unenjoyable. There are redeemable musical qualities here and there, but they can only be found with agonizing scrutiny. Its feel is slow and aimless, and is weighed down by an over-thought sound. After a 13 year run, they seem handicapped, and in need of reinvigoration.

This summer, Olivia Munn, known for G4’s “Attack of the Show!” and almost-but-not-quite baring her lady parts in magazine spreads, wrestled said lady parts into business casual and became a correspondent for “The Daily Show.” The casting of Munn led to accusations of sexism against Jon Stewart et al. by the blog Jezebel (among others), all of which were sharply rebutted by “The Daily Show.” But now, two months after Munn’s first appearance on “TDS,” the formerly vocal opposition seems to have lost traction. Why? She’s funnier than we wanted her to be.
The only other female correspondent on “The Daily Show” at present is Samantha Bee, its second most senior contributor after Lewis Black. Bee, along with former “TDS” correspondents Beth Littleford and Nancy Walls, is a beautiful woman, but Olivia Munn is—Salon.com put it best—an “unapologetic sex bomb.”
Munn’s transition to “The Daily Show,” in the grand scheme of TV comedy, is a little like walking onto the New York Yankees after a season with the company softball team. “Attack of the Show!” is tailor-made for the young male geek demographic, alternately reporting on tech, video games, comic books, YouTube, cars—see what I mean? Although Munn’s banter is consistently funny, her function on the show is troubling—little more than an appealing gadget herself. Take a now defunct segment about Munn’s favorite magazine articles: “Olivia’s Rack.”
Some critics have celebrated Munn for crafting such a highly marketable, vulgar persona, suggesting that her understanding and appreciation of her hormonal audience is its own achievement. I think that’s true, but only to a certain extent—no layer of meta-ironic self-consciousness is thick enough to conceal fundamental truth that you are wearing a sexy French maid costume and jumping into a giant pie to titillate sixteen-year-olds.
So, could Olivia Munn really have landed the comic’s dream gig based solely on her looks? It certainly seemed like it. With this in mind, we of the feminist television watching community were ready at the studio doors with torches and pitchforks. But the fact of the matter is this: she’s not bad. Her first appearance was mediocre, yes, but the second was okay, and third (an exposé on local Russian spies) was actually good.
Don’t get me wrong—she’s not winning an Emmy any time soon, but this might not be a fluke. Munn has been cast as a lead in NBC’s “Perfect Couples,” a new sitcom to debut midseason next year, which chronicles the humorous relationship struggles of three young couples. She was recommended for this role by—wait for it—Tina Fey.  Despite an unmemorable cameo in “Date Night” and an unsuccessful audition for Elizabeth Banks’s part on “30 Rock,” Munn has won the approval of one of television’s most influential women.
Considering its eight consecutive Emmy wins for Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series, “The Daily Show” knows what it’s doing. Jon Stewart threw no darts at headshots, nor did he choose from a list of candidates arranged in descending order of bra size. Is the show’s staff sexist? To me, that claim is absurd, and a distraction from the real, apolitical question: is Olivia Munn funny?
Frankly, it remains to be seen. What’s clear is that it’s only too easy to demonize her, to shoehorn her into a pre-conceived narrative of the hot girl who gets by on her hotness alone. Olivia Munn isn’t a hypothetical construct from your gender studies class; she’s a living, breathing comedian. If a woman’s appearance should have no bearing on our judgment of her comedic ability—the idea at the crux of the Munn dissent—then isn’t the corollary that we shouldn’t hold her pulchritude against her? The least we can do is give Olivia Munn a chance, and let the jokes fall where they may.

“A seamless gem of a play! Featuring performances which could be considered the summit of contemporary theater! ‘The Real Inspector Hound’ presents the audience with no less than the human condition itself!”
Or so might declare the effusive and inane theater critics at the center of Tom Stoppard’s satirical take on murder mysteries, playing through September 25 in a solid—though certainly not flawless—production by the Publick Theatre Boston at the Boston Center for the Arts.
The play’s the thing in this production, which wisely focuses on the complex and clever text and its many layers of reality. Director Diego Arciniegas underscores these various realities, in particular the audience’s experience of the play, right from the beginning—or perhaps more appropriately, beginnings—of the show. After the lights dim and eerie music pipes in—traditional indicators in this curtain-less era that the show is about to start—the effects suddenly come to a screeching halt as the house lights are turned up and several audience members skulk into the theater. The sequence repeats, and two people in the audience begin speaking.
They are critics Birdboot (William Gardiner) and Moon (Barlow Adamson), at the theater to review a murder mystery play. As they continue to converse, focusing more on their own affairs than the play they are attending, it becomes clear that the show has begun—or did it actually start when the lights went down the first time? Or when the usher showed you to your seat?
Such are the types of meta-theatrical questions “Hound” poses, which are then further complicated when Birdboot and Moon become directly involved in the action of the play they are supposed to be watching. This play—a whodunit set at a manor ripped straight from any of Agatha Christie’s works—is riddled with clichés and convenient coincidences that poke fun at the murder mystery genre’s conventions, while also demonstrating their narrative effectiveness. The play-within-the-play’s plot is largely unimportant, but it involves a web of love affairs and murders in which the manor guests find themselves entangled. Birdboot and Moon merge seamlessly into the show, and expected turmoil and a twist ending ensue.
Arciniegas’ direction throws the would-be certainties of this entire production into question: Are those late audience members who walked into the theater long after the many false endings also actors? Is Magnus Muldoon’s fake-looking beard the result of low production values or purposeful disguise? (Answers: No, and the latter). In this way, the production does justice to Stoppard’s play and the ideas behind it.
Yet, by introducing frequently languid pacing and an intermission, the play loses some of its excitement and charm. Stoppard often meditates on the big philosophical questions with a wink and a nudge, but with this production of “Hound,” the rumination comes as more of a half-hearted, slow poke. Part of the play’s fun is the rapid build-up of clichés, jokes, and twists that come to a quick and exhilarating head by show’s end. When this “Hound” finally tries to hit breakneck speed, it unfortunately stumbles.
Despite this pacing issue, the rest of the show’s elements are in place for an enjoyable production. Adamson and Gardiner have a nicely honed repartee and also take on their later, more dramatic roles quite convincingly. Sheriden Thomas as Mrs. Drudge, the manor’s maid, nearly steals the show with her well-timed comedic remarks. The manor ensemble members work well together to supply the murder mystery’s conventions—especially in recreating their earlier scenes once the critics join their play—even if Stoppard’s wit occasionally fails to register from their delivery.
Although the overstated praise Birdboot and Moon might direct at “The Real Inspector Hound” would be excessive, this production is certainly a sharp interpretation and a worthwhile experience—especially in light of the current vogue of interactive theater in the Boston area. While perhaps not as flashy as other attempts to directly engage the audience, “Hound” blurs the boundaries in a way that is both smart and fluid. Birdboot and Moon would undoubtedly agree.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
High fashion is often synonymous with over-the-top decadence—one night party dresses, gold gilded fur, and articles of clothing that cost a month’s paycheck. But in this troubled economy, many designers have reeled back the extravagance, opting for timeless casual elegance and cautious functionality—clothes that look good, pair easily, and can be worn on a regular basis. To achieve this some designers have retreated to safe and classic boredom, while their more innovative  peers have at least managed to create utilitarian fashions with a retro hint and a modern flair.
If you flip through this season’s trend reports, essays, and photo editorials of heavyweight magazines “Vogue,” “Women’s Wear Daily,” and “Elle,” you will notice that they all  herald the return to classic and beautiful women’s clothing. However, by failing to detail how the economy has affected the industry and thus who fashion houses and individuals are designing for, publications have reinforced a fictional notion of fashion as an isolated phenomenon rather than something that communicates, responds, and reflects on the everyday. By vaguely blanketing designs under the term “classicism,” —which seems to mark any clothing that references decades past—the industry has haphazardly lumped collections together and, more perniciously, assigned and perpetuated an aura of radicalism to designs that are actually conventional.
However, there were designers who succeeded in marrying functionality with innovation, wryly dissecting and discussing functionality in creative forms, but who unfortunately got lost in the hazy label of “classicism.” The Belgian designer Dries Van Noten toyed with traditional men’s work wear for the female form. The wool blazers in grey, camel, herringbone, and olive sat oversized on the models’ frames, but their sharp cinching emphasized a feminine waist. The loose mid-rise trousers drop lower in the crotch like men’s pants would fit, but taper to the ankle, seemingly lengthening and slimming the legs. Instead of feminizing these traditionally masculine articles through cropping, color, or embellishment, Van Noten seems to decisively appropriate, occupy, and subvert a domain that has conventionally been out of reach for the working woman. In his collection, Van Noten engages with the history of Saville Row tailoring and the legacies of Yves Saint Laurent and Chanel without replicating them, unlike many other collections this season that were similarly labeled as “classic.”
Citing the camel coat as an essential on its editorial page, the August issue of “Vogue” commented that designers had a “revelation” this season that “allows sophisticated customers to go beyond practical concerns...and see the aesthetic beauty of subtler things.” Practicality is a hushed term—mentioned quickly and blandly, and shielded with flashier words and phrases—insinuating that high fashion cannot just be practical. The buyer is decieved into thinking they are “sophisticated” for seeing something new and beautiful in unexceptional clothing, while the designer is privy to these creative “revelations.”
Marc Jacobs is more blunt on the subject, as he stated after his eponymous brand’s show that “sometimes beautiful is enough.” This collection and his showing for Louis Vuitton are smatterings of outfits from decades past, below the knee circle dresses, petticoats, and tired cut suits, held together by their obsolescence more so than anything else.
However, Jacobs is selling himself and his industry short. High fashion has the potential to be something more than a beautiful and luxurious commodity. As other designers have shown and continue to show, it has the ability to push sartorial and artistic boundaries each season that eventually trickle down to the public, call attention to social constructs that often go unnoticed, and complicate notions of beauty.  Fashion can  become commentary on instead of simply a reaction to modern society. Although the designers have reason to worry with the economy, they should not pluck from the history of fashion “hit list” as an easy way to stay relevant and financially successful. Rather, they should attempt to navigate between the influence of a rich history, the economic and consumer pressure for increased functionality, and an industry that is based on shifting trends and tastes.
Rather than admit that high fashion is affected by the economy, publications stubbornly and pathetically cling to the fiction of fashion being above or beyond such mundane concerns. In doing so, they make a problematic and, I believe, false assertion. Publications are essentially implying that fashion is not innovative in itself and how it relates to society, but only in the context of its history.  To them,  a wool coat already produced and seen decades ago is radical now merely because it has been reintroduced from the past—or to put it more bluntly, fashion is limited to only recycling from its own history. By insulating high fashion within the scope of its past accomplishments, these magazines also trivialize the work of the designers, undermine the richness of the industry’s history, and diminish the relevance of their own pages

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Penelope C. Umbrico, Mungo P. Thomson, Matt R. Saunders ’97, and Katarina A. Burin are amongst this year’s visiting faculty in the department of Visual and Environmental Studies (VES). Umbrico, who is based in New York, will teach “Investigations in Photo-Based Art,” a class she describes as aiming to explore inherent photographic concepts as a means for generating photo-based work. Thomson, who is simultaneously working on a book project, will teach two courses: a group critique class for students who have artistic experience across disciplines, and “Post-Studio Studio,” which presents art in a polymorphous manner. Saunders, who was himself a graduate of VES, will teach “Painting, Smoking, Eating” and “New Grounds,” both of which focus on the techniques of painting and question the nature of this medium. Burin will instruct basic drawing classes that emphasize the development of skills in the field.
Penelope Umbrico
The Harvard Crimson: You’ve taught courses on video and related media, as well as on photography. Why did you choose to teach a class on photography during your interim here?
Penelope Umbrico: I’m asking students to look at photography as a subject and break it down into its constituent parts. I’m asking them to think about how we look at things as a culture as opposed to how we look at things as individuals, and to understand our individual positions in relation to collective influences. The appropriative nature of photography lends itself perfectly to exploring questions around authorship, originality and individuality.
THC: Could you talk a bit about your piece in the Carpenter Center?
PU: It comes out of a project I did called “Desk Trajectories,” where I compiled images of used office desks for sale on the Internet. At one point these desks, the byproducts of Modernist clean minimal design, promised a kind of efficiency of productivity, but the fact that they are for sale means they are no longer useful in this way.
Mungo Thomson
THC: How do you like being on the East Coast?
Mungo Thomson: It’s good to get away. Los Angeles is a great resource if you are working in video and film. It’s a good place to be an artist, but it’s also the end of the earth in some ways.
THC: Are there any common trends in your work?
MT: The themes in my work have stayed consistent. They are about audience participation and space. My work used to be a little more culturally referential—making allusions to music and film, but I’ve become more interested in cosmology and physics. I’m not loyal to any one medium. I feel that that is the contemporary way of working. It’s by no means a disparagement of studio practice, but I can continue to make my work so long as I have my laptop and my sketchbook. For me, it’s really just a matter of going where the idea leads, and not being too beholden to the traditional ideas of how you want to make art.
THC: A project of yours, “Coat Check Chimes,” was featured in the 2008 Whitney Biennial. Can you tell us more about how this piece is an example of exploring the boundaries of traditional art?
MT: I like to do things in spaces that get overlooked and that surprise you. We replaced all 1,200 coat hangers in the Whitney Museum coat check with custom-made tune ones. When they knocked together, they made music.
Matt Saunders
THC: You seem to merge photography with a number of different art forms. Could you tell us about that?
MS: My work includes photograms. They are made from painted canvasses—no camera involved. I make a painting on a canvas, and in a dark room, I put it on a piece of photo paper, sort of like an X-ray of a painting. I was making paintings but always from sources that I found, like from pictures that I took. I was very interested in where an image came from…how it becomes re-embodied and reformed, which in my opinion is analogous to a sense of movement through the world. The photography grew from one project with an archive of small photos that I’d collected. I thought, if I had negatives for these photos all the images could be the same size, and the group would be perfect! So I made the negatives by hand, I imagined what the negative would be.
THC: How is it being back at Harvard?
MS: It’s nice being back—strange being back and to be teaching here. I’m happy to be back. I will try to refrain from telling stories of the old days in class.
Katarina Burin
THC: What are you currently working on?
KB: I’m doing a show in Cincinnati, at a gallery called Country Club. I’m curating the work of Charlie Harper, who did Golden Book illustrations for schools, my own work, and the work of New York artist Matthew Brannon. It’s nice to be in a show with somebody [Harper] from a different generation, with someone who did drawings for a specific purpose, but was also a talented craftsman.
THC: You often draw on history and architectural design for subject matter. What is the appeal?
KB: I think part of the working process for me in trying to understand my place in relation to history, and part of the process of making the work, is the kind of confusion between what we know in history, who documents, and what information we bring to it ourselves. Understanding history becomes a partially subjective and objective process—how everything is sort of part fiction, and how that gets reassembled through the work somehow.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Wandering the grounds of Harvard’s Arnold Arboretum is, for the casual visitor, a primarily aesthetic experience. On a crisp September morning the Arboretum’s sprawling landscape is all gently swaying shrubs and trees, ripe berries, and flowers in full bloom.
At the southern edge of the park stands Peters Hill, the Arboretum’s highest point, from the top of which one can see the Greater Boston area spread out at one’s feet, the still woody flatland framing the distant skyscrapers that rise over the sea. It presents the onlooker with a jarringly unexpected perspective; it at once overwhelms and calms. It is landscape experienced as sublime art.
The landscape of Harvard’s campus may not itself be one of vaulting canopies and scenic overlooks, but a brief stroll across the Yard’s cropped grass or past the Faculty Club’s manicured shrubbery is enough to prove that campus landscaping comes with aesthetic considerations of its own.
Wayne P. Carbone, Manager of Harvard’s Landscape Services, lists the three major concerns of his department as environmental sensitivity, beauty, and safety. It is telling that the latter focus on the observer of the environment; after all, Landscape Services exists not to serve the landscape but to serve Harvard.
This drive to balance the functional and sustainable with the aesthetically appealing lies at the heart of Harvard’s many recent green initiatives, from the Yard Restoration Project that gave the Yard an organic face-lift in 2007 to the Community Garden that made the small plot of land outside Lowell House a home for lettuce plants and golden sunburst tomatoes earlier this year. It is the drive not just to preserve and restore our environment but ultimately to enjoy it. It is the drive to make land into art.
A NATURAL BEAUTY
That the Arboretum’s landscape feels like art would be no surprise to the expert observer. The 265-acre landscape in South Boston is actually—save the general shape of the land—complete artifice. The Arboretum was designed in 1872 as a park by botanist Charles Sprague Sargent and Landscape Architect Frederick Law Olmsted, the man responsible for such American landmarks as Central Park and the Niagara Reservation. The Arboretum also conducts extensive horticultural and botanical research for the university.
Despite its naturalistic feel, the Arboretum’s collection of nearly 15,000 plants is carefully arranged, grouped by type, and especially rich in both native and exotic woody plants.
Julie A. Warsowe, Manager of Visitor Education, knows well the power of its naturalistic illusion: “it is, in some ways, a trick.”
“The idea,” she says, “was to create something that felt so natural that people could get lost in the environment. You have the experience of meandering down a country road, but a scientific design is behind everything you see.”
Warsowe says this careful design owes much to the parks movement, a movement based on the feeling that “people need open space to be complete people,” which was peaking at the time of the Arboretum’s opening in the late nineteenth century.
Michael Van Valkenburgh, the Landscape Architect responsible for projects from the renovation of Pennsylvania Avenue to the renovation of Harvard Yard itself, has noted the recent groundswell of Harvard initiatives meant to make campus a more attractive, open space. According to him, it is a phenomenon not unique to Harvard but still bolstered by Harvard’s uniquely historic landscape.
“It’s little exaggeration to say that the Harvard community worships its great old trees,” Van Valkenburgh writes via e-mail. But, he adds, “In the last decade, the hunger for a connection to a nurturing landscape on campuses and in cities has dramatically increased.”
Van Valkenburgh, has also taught for 28 years as a Professor of Practice at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design (GSD) in the Department of Landscape Architecture. In the future, he says, “I don’t want the department to lose sight of design in its aesthetic and experiential dimensions—beauty and sublimity and depth of feeling will never be unneeded.”
The beauty Van Valkenburgh cites as a key component of design can be immediately felt in Harvard’s most famous landscape: the Yard.
Louisa C. Denison ’11, who remembers the Yard in the fall as her most treasured mental image of Harvard’s campus, knows the simple power of a well-preserved, carefully designed landscape. She puts it quite simply: “being in a beautiful place affects you.”
THE SEEDS OF CURIOSITY
With this sentiment in mind, Denison helped to create the Community Garden, which she now co-manages. In spring 2010, various Harvard organizations—including the Center for Health and the Global Environment, Harvard University Hospitality and Dining Services, and the Office of Sustainability—worked with motivated undergraduates like Denison to create a multipurpose space.  The Garden’s creators hope not only to apply principles of sustainable gardening, but also to educate others about these same principles. This mission in part depends on the Garden’s aesthetic appeal.
“It was assumed that the garden would have to be beautiful in order to work,” says Denison. “Despite the University’s many ‘green’ initiatives, there hadn’t been a really beautiful demonstration of sustainability, a place to build community around sustainability.”
Rebecca J. Cohen ’12, another Garden Co-Manager, confirms the importance of aesthetics in the Garden’s design, an enterprise undertaken with advice from faculty from the GSD. “We really made an effort,” she says, “to make something that wasn’t just rows and rows of vegetables.”
The Garden certainly isn’t that; its carefully arranged plants and worn picnic tables make for a space that invites exploration and relaxation. Denison makes this careful balance sound absolutely natural, explaining that beauty and functionality are, at least in horticulture, not just complementary but often symbiotic: “You’re more interested in learning about a space if it’s beautiful,” she says. “And the more interesting the use of space is, the more beautiful it becomes.”
To Denison, Harvard seems particularly obliged to use its space both beautifully and sustainably. As she points out, Harvard’s vast resources give it a unique opportunity not just to experiment with its own landscape, but also to educate others in the sustainable practices it develops. It is a task that recalls the Arboretum’s threefold mission of horticulture, research, and education: a call not just to gain knowledge but also to spread it.
“Our job,” she says, “is to apply the same thoughtfulness that we apply to our studies to our landscaping.”
Carbone’s 21 years of experience at Harvard have allowed him to experience firsthand the university’s mounting drive to sustain, to beautify, and to edify. “We’re doing the experimenting,” Carbone says. “What we learn, we want other people to know, whether it’s a homeowner or another institution.”
SPACE TO THINK
As for the University itself, Carbone feels that one of Harvard’s main goals is the creation of more open community space on campus. As proof he cites the Common Spaces Initiative, which has brought changes from the impossible-to-miss colorful chairs populating the Yard to the occasional dramatic and musical performances outside the Science Center.
“The idea is to make campus more appealing for students to utilize,” Carbone says, “to bring everybody together.”
The ideal of a nurturing landscape has indeed been a driving force behind Harvard’s numerous recent initiatives, but its appeal is by no means limited to the University’s staff and students. It is an idea with universal attraction, a drive to make our surrounding landscape both enduring and aesthetically inviting. Along these lines, landscape should appeal to onlookers in order to bring people together—to unite through a shared love for a beautiful, open landscape.
Denison sees making a landscape that brings people together as a last, necessary step in designing a space like the Community Garden. It is, she says, the question those behind the Common Spaces Initiative were asking of Harvard’s campus: “it’s beautiful, but are people using it?”
CONSCIENTIOUS CREATION
Of course, a beautiful, open landscape requires regular care. Only recently has Harvard moved to make that care truly sustainable, to ensure that Harvard’s landscape can be enjoyed by generations to come. 
Beginning with the Yard Soils Restoration Project of 2007, Landscaping Services has worked to make Harvard landscaping an entirely organic process, a goal Carbone believes will be reached within the next year and a half. This will have to be accomplished despite the challenge presented by Landscaping Service’s limited domain over just 65% of Harvard’s landscape; individual departments generally control their own immediate surroundings. 
Carbone sees Harvard’s organic initiative as a natural outgrowth of its position as a pioneer in sustainable landscaping. “Harvard has been a leader,” Carbone says. “We started back before organics was the hip thing to do.”
Reaching the goal of 100% organic landscaping will mean that Harvard is fertilized solely by recycled landscape waste. Instead of bringing in synthetic fertilizers and disposing of waste elsewhere, as in the past, Harvard landscaping will become essentially one big cycle. According to Carbone, this cycle is not only good for the environment but actually cost-neutral due to Harvard’s being able to compost its own waste at the nearby Arboretum.
The price of this environmental initiative has been cut further by a reduction in number of floral arrangements, a change that also indicates a return to a more traditional look for campus. The goal, he says, is simple. “We’re trying to make a healthy plant that will be aesthetically pleasing.”
Professor Van Valkenburgh cites Harvard’s growing environmental conscience as the most dramatic shift he’s seen Harvard make in his 28 years on faculty.
“President Faust has been highly committed to sustainability, and thus Harvard’s campus is now not saturated with pesticides and herbicides,” he writes. “Green as the new Crimson is a metaphor for something more than a groundswell; it is darkness turning into light.”
 
LANDSHAPERS
Sculpting a beautiful and inviting landscape calls for a certain degree of  ingenuity. For those involved in the creative process, shaping a landscape can feel like art. 
Stephen W. Schneider, the Arboretum’s Manager of Horticulture, cites the work of one of the Arboretum’s horticultural technologists—who each manage 20-30 acres of Arboretum land—as a particularly apt example of landscaping creativity. The technologist was assigned to manage the then-overgrown Oak Path. “He worked to keep a backwoods feel to it, but to make it look cared-for,” Schneider says. In his opinion, projects like these highlight the creative aspect of landscaping.
Carbone agrees. “Creativity always plays a role,” he says, “whether it is selecting the correct tree or shrub or flowers for a planting project, determining the best way to protect the landscape during a construction project, or coming up with a compost tea recipe that will satisfy the biological needs of a soil.” 
Despite his many years at Harvard, Carbone’s favorite campus landscape is no other than the favored photo backdrop for the hordes of tourists who roam the Yard in all seasons. But his experience caring for and arranging that landscape lends personal depth to his feelings for the Yard, a depth of sentiment brought about not only by observing but by himself refining the landscape. It is, in a sense, the feeling of an artist for his best work.
“We work very hard to keep the ominous shade tree canopy healthy, whether it’s managing the Elm population from Dutch Elm Disease or structurally pruning the trees planted during the tree restoration project over the past 15 years,” he says.
But all the spent creativity, all the yearlong effort, is worth it, Carbone affirms. “It’s gratifying to walk around the Yard on Commencement day as the sun filters through the canopy on the green grass and chairs.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2008, Congress passed a federal law that requires Harvard and other publicly funded universities across the country to list both the prices and the International Standard Book Numbers of course textbooks online. Two years later, that law—as part of the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008—has finally taken effect, representing a commendable victory in the ongoing battle to make higher education more affordable to American students, who should be able to buy books as cheaply as possible.
At Harvard specifically, students can now find the required information on the Harvard COOP’s website, a far cry from the time just three years ago when the COOP called the Cambridge police on three students associated with crimsonreading.org who wrote down ISBNs in the store. Although the legislation could potentially affect in-person book sales in the Square, we do not see any cause for concern on behalf of the COOP, which is affiliated with Barnes & Noble and is hardly a small, independent bookstore. Besides, many students will likely continue purchasing their books at the COOP, an institution with roots in the Harvard community that reach all the way back to 1882, due to the convenience it offers. Either way, the new law will serve as an aid to students—particularly freshmen—who have yet to master the often overwhelming book-buying process.
In response to the law, certain members of the university community have expressed fear that students will now choose their courses based on book prices—a concern with little weight, as students have always evaluated potential classes using a variety of parameters, and some individuals already choose based on textbook prices. We have no reason to believe that the new law will significantly alter which students select courses based on this particular criterion.
Naturally, several Harvard professors told The Crimson last week that the law was an example of federal overreach. N. Gregory Mankiw, an economics professor and author of a popular textbook required for his introductory economics course, said that he is “skeptical about the federal government micromanaging such decisions.”
James Hankins, a history professor, said flippantly that, “We wait breathlessly for the federal government to prescribe mandatory potty-breaks every 15 minutes during classes.”
But such sentiments ignore the imperative to ensure that education is as affordable to students as possible, especially when textbooks can comprise a huge portion of an education’s overall cost. At community colleges, for instance, textbook costs can amount to 40 percent of a student’s total expenses. And although Harvard textbooks account for nowhere near as much—Ian Ayres, a Yale Law School professor, speculated that the figure is somewhere around five percent—the same principle still applies here in Cambridge, just as it does everywhere else. Even if the legislation has a marginal impact, it is nevertheless a step in the right direction. The federal government should make every effort to break through the very real barriers that still restrict the fruits of education to a privileged few.

The details of clinical research generally dwell in obscurity from all but those involved in the actual research. Indeed, in recent memory, few scientific issues have raised more controversy among the American public than embryonic stem cell research. This contentious topic came to a head recently when the U.S. Court of Appeals decided to repeal—for the time being, at least—a ban on Obama’s expansion of embryonic stem cell research. As researchers resumed their work, the debate continued regarding whether embryonic stem cells should be used at all. We feel strongly that stem cell research—embryonic and otherwise—is extremely important if we hope to cure diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s.
Unbeknownst to many opponents of embryonic stem cell research, the embryos used by these scientists in their research would otherwise be discarded, were they not put to scientific use. It then seems only reasonable that such excess embryos should be employed in research that has the potential to cure serious diseases. Moreover, because the in-vitro fertilization attempts that result in excess embryos are considered a last resort for women, the discarding of embryos happens on a much more minute scale than opponents assume. Although a long-term acceptance of stem cell technology has yet to crystallize, the temporary repeal of the ban on embryonic stem cell research represents a step in the right direction toward expansion of this promising field of medical science.
The research that could be conducted on these unwanted embryos and the embryonic stem cells that compose them is necessary for finding cures to debilitating diseases such as heart disease, Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s as quickly as possible. The reality of the present situation is that the number of people affected by these diseases increases dramatically every year. These embryonic stem cells have the miraculous capacity to differentiate into almost any kind of cell, evolving into hearts for victims of heart disease or new nerve and brain cells for patients suffering from Parkinson’s. For this reason, they can aid research in ways that adult stem cells cannot. If politicians were to halt stem cell research in its present nascent stage, we would be forsaking one of the brightest opportunities to improve our country’s quality of life that the medical community has seen for decades.
In spite of the potential benefits to this field, opponents persist in their efforts to uphold the decision to ban embryonic stem cell research. Politicians, activists, and concerned citizens, however, should be wary of over-politicizing their opposition, as in doing so they run the risk of falsely representing the facts about embryonic stem cell research and truly doing a disservice to American public health. Although opponents are certainly entitled to their opinions about the morality of using stem cells, they should not mix politics with their beliefs.
Embryonic stem cells provide great opportunity for scientific research at very little cost. As such, we hope that the ban on embryonic stem cell research is permanently lifted.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It has perhaps been the most divisive issue of this year, more so than healthcare, soldiers in Iraq, or any tax increase. The plans by Sharif el-Gamal to build an Islamic community center two blocks away from the site of the 9/11 attacks in Lower Manhattan has grown from a local issue into an international controversy. Although the arguments and debates surrounding this issue have ranged from the constitutionality of the building to calls for an investigation of the center’s funding, the most telling aspect of this ordeal has been the way that this center has been portrayed by the talking heads in the media to the general public.
Some, in fact, may be confused by the term “Islamic community center,” as it is more generally known as “The Ground Zero Mosque.” In headlines by Newsweek (on its cover), the Associated Press, the New York Times, and CNN, the project has been identified as a mosque as opposed to a “community center.” In the many rallies and protests that have taken place in New York City, the signs of the picketers more frequently display messages about a mosque with little mention of a community center. Digging deeper into this pattern of characterization, what becomes clear is that there is a negative connotation that the word “mosque” holds in our language today, and that the media has been using this to sensationalize this story.
But is it really sensationalism if this building will in fact be a mosque? It’s true that the definition of a mosque is very general, defined by Merriam Webster as “a building used for public worship by Muslims,” but it is also true that the media and opponents of this project have for some reason neglected to acknowledge the rest of the offerings of this center. Few of the headlines have told the story of the pool that will be a part of the center, or the gym, or the offices, or even the performing arts center. Even fewer have mentioned that part of the building will be used as a public memorial to honor those killed on 9/11. For a site that will serve all of these functions, the label of a “community center” is far more apt but has seen far less ink. The notion that this discrepancy in nomenclature is simply a subjective observation is false as well. Conducting a Google search of different terms used around this issue brought back over 41 million results for “Ground Zero Mosque,” with only five million hits for “Ground Zero Islamic center.” The title “Ground Zero Islamic cultural center” brought back less than 700,000 results.
It may be easy to brush off these differences for the fact that “mosque” is shorter than the above iterations, but in fact calling this site simply a “mosque” is grossly lacking in description and adds to confusion. In a nation where only 37 percent of the population personally know a Muslim, one would think that the term “prayer room” could convey the notion more clearly, and yet “mosque” persists.
The hardest name to find within all of these descriptions is Park51, the actual title of the proposed community center. While the list of names and titles that Park51 has received starts to become hazy, the constant use of “mosque” makes two problems painfully clear.  The first is that to the American public, the word “mosque” is still a loaded word stemming from Islamophobia, one that makes us more uneasy than the words “Islamic center.” Like all things that we know little about, we become unreasonably suspicious, and that “mosque” combines the unknown with religion makes it that much more provocative.
Furthermore, following the rest of the news makes it even more clear that the real issue is that a mosque is being built at all, not its proximity to Ground Zero: mosques all over the country have faced road blocks and discrimination, from next door in Boston to Murfreesboro, Tennessee.
The second, and more disturbing, aspect of this saga is that the media have picked up on and exploited the fact that “mosque” draws our eyes more than anything else. To gain readers, web traffic, and discussion, the more accurate “community center” label has been discarded for the irrationally indecent “mosque” over and over again. While calling this center a mosque is technically correct, its prevalence manifests the desire to generate caution and alarm from an unjustifiably loaded term.  In an interview with CBS news, Sharif el-Gamal voiced his hopes that Park51 be, “universally known as a hub of culture, a hub of coexistence, a hub of bringing people together.” So far, what this center is being known as is creating more problems rather than anything it actually aims to do. As the rallies and protest continues two blocks from Ground Zero, one must wonder how many of the opponents would have been fine with a community center, but not okay with a mosque.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You probably suffer from apocaholism and don’t even realize it. Do you believe the next 20 years will be wasted years for human development? Is your fear of the next energy, nuclear, environmental, financial, or health crisis consuming your intellectual life? Do you turn to communities with similar fears and seek to stigmatize the less concerned as idiots or dupes of big business or big government? If you answered yes to any one of these questions, it is a definite warning that you may be an apocaholic.
Apocaholics, a word coined by the writer Gary Alexander, i.e. those obsessed with perceived-coming apocalypses, are at least as old as Thomas R. Malthus and David Ricardo, and certainly much older. Throughout the last two centuries, as global living standards have skyrocketed to remarkable levels, and technology, medicine, commerce, transportation, communication, and civil society have enriched our lives in unforeseen ways, academics and intellectuals have obsessed over the supposedly imminent turning point in the history of human progress. The 19th-century British politician Thomas B. Macaulay put his finger on this jarring paradox when he asked, “On what principle is it, that when we see nothing but improvement behind us, we are to expect nothing but deterioration before us?”
Human nature’s innate pessimism typically overwhelms any natural optimism, and this universal characteristic, when happily exploited by the constant bombardment of our media, magnifies a natural suspicion for the not understood into hopeless cynicism and fear. The media is only taking advantage of a human sociological phenomenon discovered by John Stuart Mill when he wondered why, “That not the man who hopes when others despair, but the man who despairs when others hope, is admired by a large class of persons as a sage.”
Perhaps there is no greater evidence for the unfortunate effectiveness of our myopic mass media than polling data on whether Americans believe the country is heading in the right direction. According to a Sept. 5 Rasmussen poll, 66 percent of voters say the country is getting worse. The naïve may assume this negativity is a symptom of unpopular health-care reform, the Gulf oil crisis, or the hysteria surrounding the planned construction of a mosque/community center near Ground Zero. Wrong, wrong, and wrong. Even at the peak of Obama infatuation, last May, only 40 percent of voters thought the country would get better.
No, our negativity has reached the point where it’s no longer simply a symptom of our society’s ills. It’s become an ill—an addiction—and the media thrive on feeding it. There seems to be a depressingly positive correlation between the tenor of information available and the negativity we feel.
Yet I don’t knock the media for doing what makes them money; after all, “life span, income, and living standards rose again” is never going to sell as well as “we’re screwed.” The way to fight this negativity is not to separate oneself from information, but to keep the perspective of one who lives in a world that has been getting better at a consistently accelerating rate. Have your poison with a grain of salt.
I’m not trying to justify apathy or inaction. Our generation faces challenging problems in climate change, healthcare, debt, global poverty, etc. that must be faced. Fight the injustices you perceive and rally people behind your causes; individuals do change history. But have the wisdom to recognize that today’s crises will certainly pass and the good news that actually affects our lives in communication, technology, transportation, health, and entertainment will be happily ignored by those it benefits. I’m not saying put down the bottle permanently, but sobering up every once in a while is valuable.

To the editors:
We were surprised by The Harvard Crimson’s critical staff editorial about DateHarvardSQ, “It’s Not All in a Name,” and concerned about the paper’s portrayal of our online community as a divisive flashpoint for the national gender equality debate, rather than as a resource for bringing people together.  We hope that the paper will grant us this opportunity to clarify several inaccuracies in the piece, and explain why DateHarvardSQ is an excellent resource for both women and men.
First of all, we did not launch DateHarvardSQ to combat stereotypes about gender inequity. Rather, our goal has always been to offer an easy-to-use platform that helps busy Harvard students and alumni find meaningful romantic relationships.  We rolled out to Harvard men first (with platforms for Harvard women and same sex couples currently in development) because this is a community we know well, having been part of it while studying at Harvard Business School. Most importantly, we have never made the claim that a Harvard affiliation is the foremost quality of the men on our site.  Quite the contrary, we view that affiliation as a reasonable verifier of an array of admirable personal qualities, including love of learning, ambition, and success. We then rely on our proprietary matching mechanism to pair members based on personal information they upload to their profiles.
We would also like to clarify the motivation behind our payment model, to combat the misinterpretation advanced by the Crimson’s editorial. We ask our female members to pay a subscription fee because DateHarvardSQ provides them with unprecedented control over the dating process when compared to almost every major dating site. Unlike the women on our platform, the men on DateHarvardSQ cannot view five profiles a week automatically, and can only communicate with potential matches if first contacted by a female member. In other words, male Harvard students and alumni are asked to sacrifice a modicum of control in order to benefit from a simple, effective, and free online dating platform for people who may not have time to find romance through traditional dating channels (such as the bar scene or more cumbersome dating sites).
Choice is a wonderful thing, and with existing dating platforms matching singles with all kinds of different groups, we wonder why The Crimson was so quick to criticize the members of our site.  Finding a significant other is an important pursuit for everyone, and the prospect of helping Harvard men (and soon women) find the love of their lives is what motivates us above all else.  We look forward to many success stories and hope that this has been a useful clarification for The Crimson’s many readers.

Government Professor Timothy J. Colton has been appointed chair of the Government Department, replacing Nancy L. Rosenblum ’69 to lead about 50 professors and the second largest group of undergraduate concentrators.
Colton said that the department hopes to undertake a “huge effort” to improve the undergraduate program over the next few years by examining areas such as graduation requirements, the advising system, and faculty hiring.
Under his leadership, the department will focus on recruiting to bolster its research sector and to increase the student-to-faculty ratio, he said.
Colton, who is concerned that concentrators do not enroll in enough quantitative courses, said he also wants to update requirements to reflect a greater emphasis on political science.
The government department has approval from the office of Dean of Social Science Stephen M. Kosslyn to hire one more faculty member, according to Colton. But he added that the department has “enough retirements coming up that we’re just trying to make sure that we don’t shrink.”
The Government Department currently faces a shortage of professors, which could threaten the department’s standing compared to other universities, Colton said.
He hopes to continue many of Rosenblum’s initiatives, such as the new Peer Concentration Counselors program, which pairs upperclassman concentrators with junior concentrators to expand the department’s advising.
“Sometimes students don’t have time in their busy schedule to come here,” Colton said.
The department will examine the advising system with “a pair of fresh eyes” next year, and Colton will pay close attention to the economics department’s new model, which uses a dedicated concentration adviser who oversees more students but has greater specialization than graduate student advisers.
Colton graduated from the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences with a Ph.D. in philosophy in 1974.

Arianna S. Huffington, co-founder and editor-in-chief of The Huffington Post, discussed her latest book, “Third World America: How Our Politicians Are Abandoning the Middle Class and Betraying the American Dream,” with a packed auditorium of mostly white-haired Cambridge locals last night at the Brattle Theatre, which she described as “redolent of history.”
“It doesn’t exactly feel like third world America,” said Huffington, a one-time candidate for California governor and author of 13 books, as she looked out at the structure’s small capacity and exposed beams. “But it kind of could be.”
The discussion, led by WGBH’s Christopher Lydon, posed a series of questions—mostly related to the declining American middle class—to Huffington, who spoke on subjects as diverse as the “staggering” rates of unemployment in Racine, Wis., the tax-free lingerie she received for her role in “Strange Bedfellows” with Al Franken, and her favorite heroine in Greek mythology, Cassandra.
“They didn’t believe her, and they turned out to be very wrong and very dead,” Huffington said. “The idea here is to sound the alarm,” she added, referring to her book.
The villains in the book, Huffington said, are “those who allow themselves to be bought, like in a banana republic.” Later, in response to a question, she conceded that the middle class itself bears some responsibility for its economic situation.
“There is no question that many people have acted like addicts,” she said. “But there were street corner drug peddlers peddling that. We punish the drug peddlers more than the drug addicts, but here, the drug peddlers are doing great!”
In between anecdotes about her personal transformation from Bob Dole supporter to outspoken Democrat to, as Lydon put it, media’s “transformation,” she told the audience of her commitment to the fight against “third world America.”
The Huffington Post now features a new section devoted to “third world America,” she said, which collects stories of both success and struggle.
Asked what part of her book was most relevant to students, Huffington pointed to the fifth section, which, she said, is “all about solutions.”
“The millennial generation has already shown that they want to take action—TFA, City Year. There’s a really important response that’s happening. Success and money isn’t going to be the way to fulfillment,” she said.
Reactions to the event were mostly effusive.
“I wrote down my favorite thing she said,” said John Postol, an attendee, rummaging through his bag after the event. “‘We’re a country...that stopped making things and started making things up.’ I thought that was a great quote.”
At a discussion of the declining American middle class, prices failed to deter a large portion of the audience from purchasing the book. According to Nicole Shirley of the Harvard Bookstore—which organized the event and sold copies of Huffington’s book on-site—sales were good, despite the book’s $23.99 price tag.
As Lydon asked the audience during his introduction, “How many of you would have paid $5 to hear the publisher of the New York Times talk about his book, or the head of CBS, whoever that is?”
The audience just laughed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
All was quiet inside Marc D. Hauser’s Cognitive Evolution Laboratory, perched 10 floors above ground level in Williams James Hall.
The lab, which had been abuzz with activity in past academic years, was dominated by a silence pregnant with lingering uncertainties. On an afternoon late last month, two researchers manned the empty floor as a video camera pointed at a blank wall and an antiquated television set displayed the uneventful scene in black and white. Uneaten dog treats sat on disposable plates scattered throughout the lab.
The place was so quiet, in fact, that it betrayed little of the national frenzy currently surrounding the lab’s steward. Hauser is away.
On Aug. 10, the Boston Globe reported the psychology professor was taking a one-year leave of absence after a three-year internal investigation found evidence of scientific misconduct in his lab. Days later, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith confirmed that a committee found Hauser “solely responsible” for eight instances of misconduct—three of which were published studies that needed to be retracted or corrected to remove unsupported findings.
The University, Smith said, is cooperating with the Public Health Service Office of Research Integrity, the National Science Foundation Office of Inspector General, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts.
As Hauser faces federal inquiry, many of his former co-authors, graduate students, and undergraduate advisees struggle to comprehend how the man they knew as a prolific researcher, skilled communicator, and heavyweight in the field of cognitive psychology became enmeshed in scandal. Interviews with these former co-workers paint a picture of a professor who pushed himself and his lab to publish his research at a pace that was impressive—even by Harvard’s standards.
RISE TO THE TOP
When the investigation began in 2007, Hauser had maintained, by all accounts, a hands-on presence in the lab.
Even now, Hauser continues to work on his latest book “Evilicious: Why We Evolved a Taste for Being Bad,” which traces the origins of the human desire to do evil. Even while based in Cape Cod this summer, he managed his lab, and he will continue to lead his lab this year as he spends some time away from campus, researchers say.
When discussing his research, Hauser does not keep his excitement hidden: the man with the thinning gray hair and carefully trimmed goatee bobs his head, furrows his brows, and gestures with his hands to emphasize his points.
He was a distinct presence in the classroom, winning multiple awards for his teaching and gaining the recognition as one of Harvard’s most popular teachers by the senior class in 2001 and 2008. Last year, students gave Hauser a CUE score of 4.93 out of 5 for his ability to “generate enthusiasm” in his 15-person class “Psychology 2381: Hot Topics in Cognitive Science and Neuroscience.” One student said the class was the best at Harvard. Another wrote, “It’s awesome!!!!”
Passionate is one word colleagues use to describe Hauser, who started as an assistant professor in 1992 and rose to the post of associate professor in 1995 and full faculty member in 1998.
Ambitious is another word—but the trait is not necessarily pejorative, according to Psychology Department Chair Susan Carey.
“I would not think there is not a single professor at Harvard who is not ambitious, in the sense of intellectually ambitious,” Carey says. “I would describe myself as ambitious. I am working hard to describe age-old problems, and I think I can make progress.”
Noam Chomsky, an emeritus professor of linguistics at MIT and Hauser’s mentor of more than 15 years, agrees.
“He’s ambitious in the sense that he wanted to understand hard problems and open up new directions and break through impasses, not just in the work that he did with me but in much else,” says Chomsky, who worked with Hauser on several academic papers, including a 2005 paper published in Cognition titled “The Evolution of the Language Faculty: Clarifications and Implications.”
“[T]he term ambitious suggests trying to get ahead and be famous,” Chomsky says, often achieved by rushing to publish. He adds that he has “no reason to believe” that Hauser was driven by that urge.
THE DRIVE BEHIND THE MAN
Hauser graduated in 1981 from Bucknell University in central Pennsylvania and received his Ph.D. from the University of California, Los Angeles six years later.
Throughout his career, Hauser and his research teams received over $7 million in grants, not including funds from Harvard. Since 2000, he has published 143 journal articles or chapters and four books, including “Moral Minds,” according to his curriculum vitae.
During that period, he served on the editorial boards of at least five publications, oversaw graduate students’ research, and taught undergraduate courses.
Hauser’s research has focused on cognitive behavior in animals and moral psychology, and his papers span topics from primate intelligence to the role of emotions in moral psychology.
One former co-worker, who requested anonymity due to the ongoing federal inquiry, recalls instances that hinted at Hauser’s temptation to draw premature conclusions from his research that he could publish.
The former researcher points to an instance in which Hauser considered using a “statistical test that supported a conclusion that would have led to a publishable paper.”
But, the conditions necessary to use the test were not met, meaning that “the data did not show what [Hauser] wanted to show,” the former researcher says. After extended discussion, Hauser decided not to use the test and held off on publishing the paper, according to the individual.
“The fact that it took that level of discussion to make that decision was definitely concerning to me,” the former co-worker says. “It felt like [Hauser’s] motivation to publish, especially in prestigious journals, may have clouded his objectivity.”
Most colleagues interviewed for this article say they are reluctant to jump to any conclusions about Hauser’s conduct until more information becomes public. Harvard is not revealing many of the details it uncovered during its three-year-long inquiry, citing confidentiality requirements.
In his time as a professor, Chomsky says he has seen students who “go into print without thinking very hard” as well as those who are so hesitant to publish that he has had to hold their hand on the way to the thesis office.
“I think Marc is somewhere around the middle of that spectrum,” Chomsky says. “It is possible that—well, he has published quite a lot in various areas. It’s possible that some of the papers went to press without sufficient rethinking, but I don’t know of any cases.”
IN THE PUBLIC EYE
Traces of the popular professor’s presence remain in his lab. His wife Lillian Basse Hauser has been known to come by the place. Their family dog has also participated in experiments, researchers say.
Always accessible to students and colleagues, Hauser posted his Google calendar for public viewing online, in which he lists meetings with family as well as top Harvard administrators, before news of the investigation’s conclusions became public. His CV, which is still available online, lists his home address.
Weeds lean over the pebbled pathway to his home, a royal blue Coolidge Avenue two-family house near the Charles.
His home phone number is also listed in his CV. It has been disconnected.

This article has been revised to reflect the following corrections:
CORRECTIONS: September 15, 2010
An earlier version of the Sept. 13 news article "Marc Hauser's Fall From Grace" incorrectly stated that psychology professor Marc Hauser lives on Kirkland Street. In fact, he lives on Coolidge Avenue.
The article also stated that Hauser became a Harvard professor in 2005. The correct year is 1998.
The article also incorrectly suggested that a Post-it note stuck to a computer screen labeled "Sofia" found in Hauser's laboratory referenced his daughter.

Herdict, an online Internet accessibility and censorship database run by the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University, recently received a $1.5 million grant from the Omidyar Network.
Herdict—whose name is a portmanteau word of “herd” and “verdict”—provides a real-time picture of Internet accessibility around the globe by allowing Internet users to report any accessibility issues they experience.
“Herdict is a powerful tool that exposes regimes’ intent on preventing citizen access to certain sites,” wrote Stacy Donohue, director of investments for government transparency at Omidyar Network, in a press release issued by the firm. Omidyar is a philanthropic investment firm that aids organizations hoping to bring about economic, social, and political change.
Herdict plans to use the grant to spin off from the Berkman Center and become an individual non-profit, according to Robert M. Faris, research director of the Berkman Center and one of the core members behind the website.
“We don’t see ourselves as the long-term home for such project,” Faris said. “We see ourselves as the incubators.”
With the grant, the website is one step closer to its goal of contributing to research on Internet neutrality—the idea that the same online content should be available regardless of location.
The website also has versions in Chinese, Russian, Persian, and Arabic, languages spoken in countries where government censorship is relatively strong.
By allowing Internet users to report on any access problems they face, the website ensures that “blockage is not a quiet thing,” said Harvard Law School Professor Jonathan L. Zittrain, who conceived the idea for the website.
Herdict will also use the grant to test new methods of “crowdsourcing”—the increasingly popular technique the project currently uses, which involves asking large groups of people to perform a given task in an open forum.
The grant will also fund the redesigning of the website to make it more user-friendly and to hire more staff to work on the project, according to Laura S. Miyakawa, Herdict’s project manager.
“We are ecstatic about the grant,” Miyakawa said. “We are absolutely thrilled to have the opportunity to really grow.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A male Harvard undergraduate was the victim of a hate crime and robbery on Sunday, according to a Harvard University Police Department crime report released yesterday.
The student was walking down Garden Street from the Quad when three unidentified men began pursuing him and whispering homophobic slurs such as “fag” and “queer.” After chasing him onto a side street, the suspects demanded the victim’s cell phone and wallet, which they threw on the ground before fleeing the area.
The student, who was not harmed during the crime, described the three suspects as white or Hispanic and in their early 20s.
Since the incident did not occur on Harvard property, it is being investigated by the Cambridge Police Department.
Harvard Queer Students and Allies Co-Chairs Marco Chan ’11 and Emma Q. Wang ’12 said that Harvard’s queer community and its allies were distressed by the incident, adding that hate crimes and acts of discrimination are not the norm at Harvard.
“This is an insulated incident as far as our campus goes, but not so isolated when we go beyond greater Boston and Massachusetts,” Chan said. “The message it sends to new students is particularly distressing since it’s so early in the year.”
Wang agreed that new students should not assume that such crimes are frequent at Harvard, noting that the University is generally an accepting place for members of the queer community.
HUPD Spokesman Steven G. Catalano also said that this type of crime is unusual for the Harvard area.
“Fortunately, the instances of bias-related incidents and bias crimes (“hate crimes”) on and around campus are relatively rare,” he wrote in an e-mail.
Although hate crimes directed against LGBT members of the Harvard community are uncommon, QSA has partnered with HUPD in the past to offer self-defense workshops specifically designed for LGBT students.
Wang said that while such workshops were offered, attendance was low, a fact she linked to a general sense of security on and around campus.
“The threat of violence is something that is kept in the back of one’s mind, and a self-defense workshop acknowledges that one can be the target for violence,” she said.
As a result of this latent attitude, Wang said the incident has made members of the LGBT community “more aware of their physical vulnerability.”
Chan said that this instance could become an opportunity for Harvard students­—not only LGBT individuals, but the wider community as well—to reflect on making Harvard a safe space for everyone.
He noted that QSA plans to address this crime—which represents a more pressing threat in other areas—through events, further self-defense workshops, and other outreach programs to ensure that Harvard remains a tolerant and supportive community.
“We don’t want queer people to feel like this has confirmed their suspicions that homophobia is the pervasive sentiment on campus,” she said, adding that LGBT people, allies, and the student community need to be proactive in addressing the reality of hate crimes.
“This is a space we all collectively have ownership over,” Chan said. “This whole environment is shared, built, and created by all of us, and no person, no student, no identity of any background should feel any level of insecurity.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
MSNBC political pundit Chris Matthews turned to Harvard Republican Club President Mark A. Isaacson ’11 yesterday and asked him when he first “felt” Republican.
“When did you get that visceral sense, ‘Damn it, I’m right,’” a bombastic Matthews asked. “You know, starting to love Doug MacArthur and Chiang Kai-shek, Vietnam. When did your heroes begin to be Daddy Warbucks, Joe Kennedy?”
Isaacson had three seconds to respond before he was cut off. “It’s funny, I have trouble pinpointing...”
“No, no, are you going to answer the question or try something?” said Matthews, sensing equivocation. “When did you first feel Republican is the question, and I’d like an answer.”
The lauded and loathed host of “Hardball” brought his irreverent Socratic style to the Kirkland Junior Common Room yesterday afternoon. He grilled Isaacson and Harvard College Democrats President Jason Q. Berkenfeld ’11 on hot-button issues like President Barack Obama’s heritage, an undisciplined “loosey-goosey” Democratic party, and midterm election turnout.
For Matthews’ recent visit to Kirkland, the organizers of the series “Kirkland Conversations” decided to orchestrate a live rendition of “Hardball” with two of the most prominent undergraduate politicos on campus in the hot seat.
After Isaacson and Berkenfeld agreed to participate, the event organizers called them a few days before the event to make sure they knew what they were getting into.
“They called and asked, ‘Do you have any debate experience,’” Berkenfeld recalled. “‘Can you handle this?’”
Berkenfeld was well-aware of Matthews’ unconventional style, but was surprised to find Matthews more centrist than expected.
“Everyone expects him to be the liberal counterpoint to Bill O’Reilly and Glenn Beck, but I don’t think he toes any party line,” Berkenfeld said after the debate.
Isaacson said that, as anticipated, Matthews was ruthless, but that he was “impressed” by his willingness to consider opinions that were not liberal.
“I expected it to be tough, and he was tough,” Isaacson said.
Matthews was not so easy on the audience, either.
During his opening remarks, Matthews uncrossed his arms and asked, “If you know who Margaret Thatcher is, raise your hand.” Unimpressed by the handful of raised arms, Matthews called on an audience member.
“You, in the red shirt, who is Margaret Thatcher?”
The student shrugged. Matthews pointed at someone else.
“The prime minister...”
“Okay, okay, that’s enough,” Matthews cut in. “You all know more than Sarah Palin.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Nov. date for the Massachusetts gubernatorial election fast approaches, many Harvard students and recent graduates find themselves swept up in the excitement of a faceoff featuring two alumni: Democratic incumbent Deval L. Patrick ’78 and Republican challenger Charles D. Baker ’79.
The students and alumni’s level of involvement ranges from boarding buses for weekend canvassing trips to working around the clock for full-time campaign jobs.
Gabriel S. Neustadt ’13 falls somewhere in the middle.
As an active Democrat and member of the Institute of Politics, he teaches civics in Cambridge public schools and serves on the IOP Survey Committee. Neustadt sought out an internship with the Patrick campaign on his own.
“The way politics works is, you just get involved,” he says.
A TYPICAL DAY ON THE CAMPAIGN
Neustadt worked on the operations aspect of the Patrick campaign this summer—a job that required attention to detail and careful analysis—and he continues to be involved part-time through the fall.
“Scheduling [Patrick’s] day is strategic,” Neustadt says. “You have to think about where he should visit and once you decide, you have to arrange for the events...And then at night, they would have fundraisers.”
Neustadt says he took pride in writing briefs that ended up on Patrick’s desk—a particularly meaningful task since he believes strongly in the governor’s work.
“When you look at the other candidates, the governor by far should be reelected,” Neustadt says. “I knew I had to work for him.”
That commitment held despite the fact that Neustadt hails from Florida: “I love politics,” he says. “I love being involved in Massachusetts politics since I’m going to be a resident for the next three years.”
GETTING ON THE BANDWAGON
The atmosphere of student political involvement was “one of the reasons why I came to Harvard,” Neustadt says, and while few current students are as involved in the campaigns as he is, campus political groups are also taking part in this year’s campaign.
On Sunday, the Harvard College Democrats took the first of several canvassing trips in Mass. and N.H. to campaign for Patrick, according to group President Jason Q. Berkenfeld ’11.
paign for Patrick, according to group President Jason Q. Berkenfeld ’11.
He says that the Dems first helped elect Patrick in 2006, and this year they will continue mobilizing students to help ensure that voters make it to the polls. The challenge, Berkenfeld says, lies not in student awareness of politics, but moving them to action.
On the Republican side, “record numbers” of freshmen attended the Harvard Republican Club’s first event, according to President Mark A. Isaacson ’11, a former Crimson editorial writer. He attributes the increased attendance to the upcoming election, and adds that many upperclassmen who previously had not been active in the club are now getting involved due to the momentum carried over from the success of Republican Scott Brown’s senatorial campaign last year.
Beginning next week, HRC members will make campaign phone calls at Baker’s headquarters, and they hope to campaign in N.H. and Conn. soon, according to Isaacson.
YOU’RE HIRED
Some Harvard students who were involved in political student groups have moved on to work full-time jobs upon graduation.
Elizabeth K. Mahoney ’05, a former HRC member and the current research director for the Baker campaign, says that she fell in love with politics as an undergraduate at Harvard. She had spent two of her summers during college working on congressional and state senatorial campaigns.
Mahoney’s current job involves responding to opponents’ claims in the press—making it, in her words,  “crazy” and “a blast.”
“The intensity has changed from when we first started,” says Mahoney, who officially joined Baker’s team last November. “Before, people were just trying to figure out who he was. We were fighting to get reporters to show up at events.”
On the other side of the campaign, Harvard Law School graduate Bridgette L. Hylton says that her interest in politics also began while at Harvard.
“During law school, the whole Obama thing happened,” says Hylton, who graduated from the school in 2009 and is now a staffer on Patrick’s campaign. “Obama really put me over the edge—I was really excited.”
Spurred by such excitement, Hylton began to take campaign trips organized by the Dems. Upon graduation, she initially worked at a New York law firm, but called Patrick’s office multiple times until she was offered a job. Hylton began as a volunteer coordinator and was eventually able to convince the campaign to offer her a job as a policy director.
FROM THE OUTSIDE-IN
Not all Harvard graduates working on the gubernatorial campaigns were heavily involved with politics when they were at Harvard—some took a less traditional path.
One such example is B. Kyle Armbrester ’07. Though he had been a member of the HRC, Armbrester says he never took part in politics and was more interested in pursuing IT-related activities on campus. A temporary assignment at the Baker campaign to support IT infrastructure drew him to return again and pursue a full-time job. Currently, he oversees online communications and IT on the Baker campaign.
“People work long hours, building up to one day,” says Armbrester, describing his first hands-on experience with a political campaign from inside-out. “It is very exciting and very hectic.”
He says that his background as a government concentrator helped him to understand the foundation of policy issues, but he describes the campaign work as “a lot like a start-up business.”
Armbrester sums up the enthusiasm and hectic schedule described by other Harvard affiliates working on the campaigns: “[The work] doesn’t stop on weekends,” he says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge City Council met for the first time in the new fiscal year yesterday to discuss a wide range of issues that have been pressing the city’s residents, including funding for affordable housing in the city and increased summer tourism traffic.
Following the urging of several residents during the public comment section of the meeting, the Council formally approved the recommendation of the Community Preservation Act Committee that the City allocate 80 percent of the CPA Local Fund revenue—$5,200,000—to affordable housing via the Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust in fiscal year 2011.
Although Cambridge’s property values are among the highest in the state, following the repeal of rent control in the 1990s, the City has built and funded several affordable housing developments.
While the percentage of CPA money going to affordable housing remains steady, the amount of the allocation rose by $200,000 from last year.
This allocation, in addition to money from the state match fund and the CPA fund balance, brings total CPA contributions to affordable housing to an estimated $7,460,000 for fiscal year 2011, according to documents submitted to the Council by City Manager Robert W. Healy.
In Harvard Square matters, the Council passed a recommendation from the License Commission allowing changes in the routes of several Boston and Cambridge tour companies—including Super Duck Tours, LLC, City View Trolley Tours, and Boston Upper Deck Trolley Tours.
As a result of the ruling, Healy will investigate possible route amendments.
Councillor Kenneth E. Reeves ’72 brought up the issue of the tours for discussion at the meeting. Given the growth in tourism since then, “I wonder who is overseeing the overall tourism,” Reeves said.
Specifically pointing out the proximity of Harvard Yard and “The Pit,” Reeves added that such “interesting” locations are prone to having “something of a circus-like aspect, and I am wondering who’s in charge of it.”
Reeves, who has served on the Council for 20 years, recalled recommending establishing an Office of Tourism when he first came to council, though he said the idea was dismissed at the time.
In a historical place such as Harvard Square, Reeves added, it is necessary to “keep the buses from overwhelming the entire scene.”
According to Healy, the Cambridge Traffic Director has met with such tours in order to assign them particular areas. The tours’ routes currently run down Mt. Auburn Street at the edge of Harvard property.
In addition, Healy added, Harvard has previously agreed, in cases where tours involve long bus trips and long pauses, that Super Duck Tours and similar companies should be allowed to let tourists disembark in Harvard Square near Au Bon Pain.
According to Reeves, however, officially registered tour companies are not the only problem: “There are large buses that bring a group of foreign language speakers and when you have eight or 10 of them, it can be chaotic.”
The City Council unanimously passed the proposal for further discussion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A former Harvard Hillel accountant was sentenced to serve up to three years in jail after pleading guilty on Friday to stealing nearly $780,000 from the religious nonprofit.
The Massachusetts Attorney General’s office announced yesterday that William O’Brien, who was hired by Hillel in 2003 through the financial management contracting agency Insource Services, pled guilty to charges of larceny, forgery, and false entries in corporate books.
Annette Ezekiel, chief operating officer of Harvard Hillel, and John H. LaChance, O’Brien’s attorney, did not return requests for comment yesterday.
Hillel discovered the financial reporting irregularities in 2008, according to a letter sent to the organization’s student community by Hillel President and Director Bernard Steinberg and Chair of the Board of Directors Robert Beal that year.
After noticing the irregularities, Steinberg launched an internal investigation that found O’Brien had been diverting the nonprofit’s funds for his own personal use and notified the Attorney General’s office.
O’Brien’s contract was immediately terminated, Steinberg and Beal’s 2008 letter stated.
The Attorney General’s office investigated Hillel’s claims and reached a similar conclusion as the internal investigation.
State investigators found that O’Brien issued checks from Hillel payable to the nonprofit’s American Express account, a business owned by one of his friends, and a vendor that Hillel did business with. He then used those checks to pay his own American Express account and purchased items such as tickets for trips and sporting events with the stolen money.
O’Brien concealed the thefts by falsifying data regarding the transactions in Hillel’s financial books, according to the Attorney General’s office.
State investigators allege that O’Brien’s thefts began in 2003 and continued until Hillel’s investigation in 2008.
A Middlesex County Grand Jury indicted charges against O’Brien on July 2, 2009, and imposed additional charges on Feb. 19 of this year. O’Brien was arraigned on Feb. 25 in Middlesex Superior Court and pled not guilty on all charges. He was released on good faith.
The news of the embezzlement had followed months of rumors that Hillel was facing financial difficulties. When asked that January about such rumors, Steinberg vehemently denied that the organization was facing fiscal hardships beyond those caused by the economic downturn.
O’Brien’s fraud is not the only case of embezzlement at Harvard in recent years. Between 2000 and 2001, two undergraduate officers at the Hasty Pudding Theatricals stole almost $100,000 from the organization. Between 1988 and 1994, a financial officer at Harvard Magazine, the University’s alumni publication, embezzled $190,000.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the past two years, Harvard has entered its match against the University of Connecticut ranked sixth in the country, its highest ranking in school history.
In 2009, any hopes of moving up in the polls were dashed as the Crimson was handily defeated at the hands of the Huskies by a score of 4-0. Harvard managed only two shots on goal compared to the opponent’s nine.
The sound defeat last year influenced the manner in which many returning starters prepared for this year’s rematch against UConn. It was no different for junior goalkeeper Austin Harms.
“Walking off the field last year after that UConn game was one of the most embarrassing few minutes…[of] my entire year,” Harms said. “After the crowd lays into you like that…particularly at me being in goal…it was a humbling experience.”
Spurred by memories of last year’s game, the Winthrop House resident ramped up his preparation not only for the tenth-ranked Huskies—which Harms labeled as “a perennial powerhouse”—but also for the crowd.
“The atmosphere there is powerful; it’s intense,” Harms said, describing it as “four thousand people screaming at you.”
Harms’ work paid dividends. This time around, despite facing 25 shots from the Huskies’ attack, Harms surrendered only one goal, playing a key role in the 1-1 tie last Saturday. In fact, UConn’s lone score came on a penalty kick in the 44th minute after a hand ball was called in the box.
“He really stepped up his game,” senior forward Alex Chi said. “He was really focused, he was composed, and he made the saves he needed to make.”
“Austin played out of his mind,” sophomore forward Zach Wolfenzon said.
Perhaps Harms’ most important and outstanding save came in the second period of overtime. As the Huskies pressed downfield, UConn forward Mamadou Diouf received the ball within the box, spun to create enough separation from the defenders, and fired a shot that Harms tipped just enough to knock over the crossbar.
“[Diouf] just turned and launched a rocket,” Harms said. “If that went in, the game would have been over.”
“I don’t know how [Harms] did it,” Chi added.
In addition to the 25 shots—compared to the Crimson’s six—the Huskies also had nine corner kicks as opposed to Harvard’s two. Nevertheless, UConn’s constant pressure did not faze Harms.
Harms’ three saves did not do justice to his performance; he repeatedly pressured the Huskies’ offense, causing the frontline to only manage four shots on goal.
“His presence in goal is not just his shot saving [but also] when they cross the ball and he comes out,” Chi said.
As goalie, Harms helped coordinate the defense, which also had an impressive game. Many potential shots were deflected by oncoming defenders in what became a defensive battle for the Crimson.
“He was back there controlling everyone, back there making saves, kicking well, and it was great to see him do so well in such a big game,” Wolfenzon said.
While Harms’ play against UConn proved instrumental to the team’s success, his effort against Stanford on Sept. 4 was just as laudable. The Cardinal took 15 shots, five of which were on goal, yet Harms only allowed one score, keying Harvard’s 2-1 victory over Stanford in the inaugural match at Soldiers Field Soccer Stadium.
The Crimson keeper has a long record of being a force in Harvard’s backfield. As a freshman starter, Harms compiled a 0.55 goals-against average, best in the Ivy League and 11th best in the nation. In addition, he was twice named the Ivy League Rookie of the Week.
As a sophomore, he had seven shutouts and a 0.80 goals-against average, second in the Ivy League. His play helped propel the Crimson into the third round of the NCAA tournament.
Harms has a large impact off the field as well, inspiring teammates with his dedication and passion.
“Whenever possible he’s working, whether it’s out there practicing or…in there watching video,” Wolfenzon said. “He’s always got his mind on soccer. He just loves the game and he loves being out there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard sailing team opened its 2010 fall season this past weekend in rather familiar waters, as the Crimson traveled to four regattas throughout New England. With only a few days of practice so far this season, Harvard used the opening weekend to get its more experienced sailors comfortable sailing with each other once again and to introduce its freshmen to the world of collegiate sailing.
“None of our pairs had sailed together since early June, and about half of us were not able to get into the water on a regular basis this summer,” junior crew Alexandra Jumper said. “So we mainly used this weekend to get back into the groove of being on the Charles.”
The co-ed squad provided the highlights on the Crimson’s first weekend of competition, as it finished fourth in the top co-ed regatta of the weekend, the Harry Anderson Trophy, and also notched two victories in two smaller regattas here in Boston.
Meanwhile, the women’s team traveled slightly down the river to MIT, where it took seventh place at the Toni Deutsch Trophy regatta.
“The co-ed squad returned the same core group of skippers from last year,” junior skipper Brendan Kopp said. “So it shouldn’t be as big of a transition for us getting ready for this year as it is going to be for the women’s team.”
HARRY ANDERSON TROPHY
The co-ed squad’s top sailors traveled to Yale over the weekend to compete in the first intersectional regatta of the fall, the Harry Anderson Trophy.
The Crimson finished fourth out of 20 teams.
In the A division, senior skipper Alan Palmer teamed up with senior crew Quincy Bock for eight races and sophomore crew Alma Lafler for four more. The trio collected three victories and two runner-up efforts out of the 12 total races.
Senior skippers John Stokes and Tedd Himler split time at the helm of Harvard’s B-division boat, with senior Meghan Wareham providing the majority of the crewing duties.
The group finished in seventh place in the division, with four top-four showings.
TONI DEUTSCH TROPHY
The Crimson women finished seventh out of 14 teams at the Toni Deutsch Trophy regatta, hosted by MIT on the Charles River. Junior skipper Emily Lambert competed with Jumper in the A division, where the duo brought home a fourth place effort, including three wins and six top-three finishes.
Rookies Caitlin Watson and Morgan Russom split time as skipper for Harvard’s B-division boat, as the pair teamed up with junior crew Marie Appel to finish eighth in the division.
“We lost some major contributors to graduation,” Jumper said. “But we are hoping our two freshmen can make big strides over the next few weeks as they get adjusted to collegiate sailing. They have so far in practice, so we are optimistic.”
LARK INVITATIONAL, CENTRAL SERIES ONE
At the Central Series One regatta, the Lark Invitational, which was hosted by Tufts University over the weekend, Harvard took home top team honors in dominant fashion. The Crimson finished with 168 points over the two days of competition and beat the other eight schools in the field by over 100 points.
A pair of third-year sailors, Kopp and crew William White, finished first in the A division of racing, as the duo claimed 11 victories out of 18 races in the division. Senior skipper Colin Santangelo and junior crew Julia VanderVink earned two victories in the B division of racing.
“The Lark Invitational was a smaller local regatta,” Kopp said. “But we were still very pleased with how we performed and it was good for us to get tuned up for the rest of the year.”
HARVARD INVITATIONAL
Competing close to home on the Charles River in the Harvard Invitational, a small contingent of Crimson co-ed sailors claimed top honors among 12 teams. The A-division pair of sophomores Ryan Byrne and Nicholas Gordon placed third in its division, while sophomore skipper Sam Millham and freshman crew Alice Kenney won the B division of racing with five first-place finishes in eight races.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a girl who loves watching sports and loves writing about them even more, I do admit that I sometimes feel like I’m alone in a sea of testosterone. I’ve grown accustomed to the strange looks I get when guys realize that I know far more about baseball than they do, and I have long since come to terms with the fact that if I sit down to watch a hockey game with the majority of my female friends, I’ll spend more time explaining the rules to them than actually watching the action.
I think that’s part of the reason why I’ve spent most of my three-plus years covering sports for The Crimson writing about women’s teams.
As a former (admittedly not very talented) female athlete myself, I want to make sure they get the respect they deserve.
Then, a year and a half ago, my friend Dixon—the sports chair and returning football writer at the time—convinced me that covering the Crimson football team was my Harvard sportswriting destiny.
And so I decided to leave my girl-power mantra behind for a season and cover the quintessential guys’ game. But here’s a secret: for a girl who loves sports, I used to know next to nothing about football.
That changed in a hurry last fall, when I spent every Saturday immersed in the sport.
I quickly learned how to recognize a good block when I saw one, how to appropriately describe an offensive formation, and learned more than I ever could have imagined about the pecking order of Ivy League football. I’ve grown to appreciate the perks of a nice press box after a long drive (hello, Columbia!) and of a talkative, media-savvy coach after a long game.
And really, there’s nowhere else I’d rather be getting my football education.
Now granted, following a season on the gridiron at Harvard isn’t quite as exciting as it would be at a BCS powerhouse school. As an Ivy League, FCS school, neither the caliber of play nor the level of student interest can compare to what it’s like at Texas, Boise State, or even Stanford. I’m not fighting with ESPN to have my voice heard in press conferences (but to be honest, I like it that way).
Many of you might not realize that at Harvard, we are lucky enough to have a football team that’s currently one of the best FCS (formerly I-AA) schools in the country.
Period.
Over the last 10 years, the Crimson has accumulated a 76-23 record, good for a 0.768 winning percentage from 2000 to 2009.
That’s second only to Montana—a school with 13,000 undergrads and the ability to award football scholarships—in the whole FCS.
Harvard’s also a standout among its Ivy peers, both in the last decade (four Ivy titles, tied with Penn for tops in the league) and since the beginning of round-robin league play in 1956 (a 0.612 in-conference winning percentage, best in the Ancient Eight).
Throw in the four Crimson alumni currently playing in the NFL—including six-time All-Pro center Matt Birk ’98, currently with the Baltimore Ravens, and Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05, currently a backup quarterback on the Bills’ roster.
It’s apparent that coach Tim Murphy has built up quite the powerhouse in his 17 years with the program.
And the word coming out of preseason camp is that this season is going to be no different.
Harvard’s once again picked by the media to finish atop the league, and players and coaches are confident that even with the graduation of key players and another new quarterback—senior Andrew Hatch—under center, the championship trophy will be back in Cambridge come November.
But the Crimson’s sustained excellence in both its conference and division isn’t the only reason I love being around Harvard football.
Because we have the unique experience of being at a school that attracts not only great athletes but values education above all else, every player and coach I’ve interacted with here has been intelligent, articulate, and talented—and most have a great story to boot.
I’m back for my second year on the football beat starting on Saturday night, and hopefully by the end of it I’ll finally be able to talk authoritatively about schemes and strategy with my co-writers who’ve grown up watching NFL Countdown since kindergarten.
Some things may never change—I’m always going to be able to rattle off Red Sox stats more readily than the Patriots’ starting lineup, and I’m still going to consider watching an episode of Friday Night Lights a more-than-adequate substitute for watching Monday Night Football.
But at least I know that I’ll graduate in May with not only an excellent academic education, but an excellent football one as well.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard football team has its starting quarterback, and his name is Andrew Hatch.
The senior and former LSU signal caller won the starting job in preseason after senior Collier Winters, a second-team All-Ivy pick last year and the incumbent starter, suffered an injury that will likely be season-ending in an intrasquad scrimmage.
“He’s got a torn adductor muscle, he’s also got a torn labrum, so it would be miraculous to see him again this season,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “That doesn’t mean it can’t happen, but we’re certainly not counting on it.”
That leaves Hatch in sole possession of the quarterback job. Though the senior has never started a game for Harvard, he did make three starts for the then-defending national champion LSU squad in 2008.
“We’re very fortunate to be in a position where we’re getting a very good quarterback, a kid who has started games in the SEC,” Murphy said. “We’re very confident that we can compete on a championship level with Andrew in there, even though we lost a great player in Collier.”
To read more about Hatch and the rest of the Crimson football squad, check out The Crimson’s annual football preseason supplement, hitting newsstands Friday. Harvard opens its season at home against Holy Cross on Saturday at 7 pm.

Lonnie Jackson, a 6’4”, 170-lb. senior at Valencia High School (Valencia, Calif.), has confirmed to The Back Page that he is being recruited by Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker and his staff.
According to ESPN, Jackson “has a terrific looking jump shot with a very smooth release.” The shooting guard, rated at three stars by both Scout and Rivals, averaged over 23 points per game for Valencia last season.
Jackson said he currently has offers from Southern Methodist University, Boston College, Pepperdine, Penn, Harvard, and Northeastern. He is also interested in Stanford, which has not given him an offer at this point. Having not taken any official visits, Jackson said all the schools are even at this point.
Jackson said he will be visiting Boston College this weekend, as well as Northeastern. It does not appear that he will be visiting the Crimson, though there is mutual interest.
“Harvard offered me a while ago,” Jackson said. “Me and Yanni [Hufnagel, an assistant coach], we’re real close. He’s a great guy...I like the head coach. We’ll see where it goes from here, but Harvard’s been really good to me.”
Carrying a 3.7-3.8 GPA, Jackson said he is looking for a school with an optimal balance of academics and basketball, and that he currently has no timetable for a decision.

Despite a seemingly bleak job market, a recent Wall Street Journal survey of 479 companies revealed that recruiters hired over 43,000 grads in the previous year. Even more surprisingly, recruiters stayed away from the Ivy League—of businesses’ top 25 schools, Harvard didn’t make the cut.
Instead, recruiting managers prefer scouting at big schools, with larger number of potential employees and long-term partnerships with specific departments, according to WSJ. Nineteen of the 25 schools that apparently produce the best graduates are state schools. Funny enough, Cornell is the only Ivy that made the list.
One of Harvard’s own, Economics professor Claudia Goldin, told the WSJ that “we have none of the basic bread-and-butter courses that serve you well in much of the industry” and that’s why we weren’t favored. Although one could argue that the Science and Cooking course might include such "bread and butter," it still may not lure Google Inc. and General Electric to campus.
Fortunately, another Journal article reports that chief executives tend to retain close ties with their alma maters. So get close to that Economics concentrator down the hall who wants be the next Mark Zuckerberg '06 (and therefore has friended every Harvard student on Facebook).

It’s never too early in your Harvard career to start a war.
With only three weeks on campus, Crimson Yard UC Candidate Matt P. Abrams '14 has already set off a firestorm on Adams e-mail listserv this week with his ambitious campaign. His platform—though tried and tested to be ineffective—calls for unrestricted Crimson Yard freshmen access to Adams dining hall.
In response to Abrams’ challenge, Adams residents backlashed even harder. An e-mail that included Abram’s phone number was sent out last night to all Adamsians so they can tell Abrams exactly what they thought of his plan. And they delivered.
Since then, Adams defenders have sent Abrams over a dozen texts and voicemails, from threats (“Bow down to the River Gods”) to pleas (“3 things are sacred to me in this world—my Bible, my college football Saturdays, and my restricted access to the Adams Dining Hall. Please reconsider”).
So why did Abrams choose dining restrictions for his campaign platform? We went right to the source.
What made you choose dining restrictions?
When it’s snowing and you just want to get a bit of energy, you don’t want to make the 20-minute trip to Annenberg. It’s one less thing for us to be burdened with, being in Union dorms.
 
So, why Adams?
I wasn’t trying to target Adams. When I asked people in my dorm, people in my yard, a lot of people didn’t like how freshmen have such trouble getting into Adams.
You’ve been on campus about three weeks. Have you eaten in Adams yet?
No. I’ve eaten in Quincy once. And I crashed an Adams brain break.
Do you know the history of Adams dining restriction fights?
I heard about it.
Did you know before you made this promise?
After.
Are you prepared to fight?
Oh, I’m ready.
