After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last June, the country was captivated by the arrest of 10 Russian spies, a tale complete with coded messages and buried caches of money that was reminiscent of Cold War fiction (albeit lacking in actual secrets). Yet they were not the only spies uncovered in recent years—a couple working for Florida International University pled guilty to charges of spying for Cuba in 2006. Unlike the Russian example, this case had arguably serious consequences, chiefly for Floridian academics and students who, shortly thereafter, were prohibited from traveling to Cuba and four other nations deemed by the U.S. State Department to be “state sponsors of terrorism.” This ban on academic travel impeded—and continues to impede—a valuable flow of ideas between Americans and those in nations with which we most need to communicate.
The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals recently loosened the strictures of the initial law, ruling that Florida could not prevent people from traveling if they acquired private funding. However, it upheld the state’s right to prevent travel with public funds to the five countries in question. The list comprises Cuba, Iran, Sudan, Syria, and North Korea, despite President George W. Bush’s removal of the latter in 2008.
As it now stands, this law remains harmful to the intellectual and cultural exchange between nations that is crucial to fostering growth, tolerance, and progress. It is particularly vital for those countries with significant cultural and political differences to learn about one another, since increased knowledge often leads to greater understanding and acceptance. Academic dialogue can serve as a special type of diplomacy, which is even more necessary in light of the fact that conventional political means have largely failed to improve American relations with these five states. The travel ban only increases mutual mistrust and animosity, benefiting no one.
Professors and students should furthermore not be bound by the ideological and political considerations that drive and define the list of state sponsors of terrorism. The continuing debate over North   Korea’s inclusion, even in recent years since the law’s initial passage, illustrates the political subjectivities involved in applying these labels. Particularly considering Florida’s large Cuban community, its residents should not be held hostage by the vagaries of changing politics.
Especially given that other states do not impose the same restrictions, Florida’s academics who rely on public funding are unfairly disadvantaged by not being able to travel to the same places as their peers. Since no travel ban exists on the national level, Florida’s law alone does little to ameliorate the problem its proponents hope it will address, while the few professors and students to whom this law applies are deeply harmed. The legislation was likely introduced in response to the 2006 spy scandal, but such a limited measure can ultimately do little to solve the much larger problem of foreign espionage.
While the five countries named clearly present difficult foreign policy challenges, cutting off academic ties will only worsen the situation, ultimately harming the international cross-cultural dialogue is inherently valuable, and we hope to see it prioritized across all 50 states.

Students in Florida are an unlucky bunch—but not because of the restrictions the state government has put on academic travel. Currently, no public funds may be used by students or professors at public Florida universities for travel to five states. But that limitation pales in comparison to the other roadblocks toward education in the Sunshine State: Its students are the victims of an underfunded education system that ranked 50th out of the 50 states in a 2008 U.S. Census Bureau report. Which is a greater injustice: College students unable to receive state funding to study abroad in Syria or fifth graders unable to receive the kind of education that will get them to college in the first place? While the college students and professors may be missing out on valuable experiences, the greater tragedy is undoubtedly that of the fifth graders. Florida's new restrictions on funding, therefore, should be applauded as a first step in the reorganization of budget priorities.
It is important to note that Floridian students and professors are not forbidden from traveling to Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, or Syria—the restricted countries. They just will not receive state funding to do so. In its original text, the law did impose such restrictions, but in 2008 a judge ruled that the states could not so restrict privately funded trips. As it now stands, the law does not restrict students' liberty, only their means—a compromise that is completely acceptable. The same could be said for organizations at universities that do not receive university funding. Members of these organizations are ultimately free to do as they wish, even if they have to raise funds on their own. Travel to foreign countries, like participation in campus organizations, has many benefits to one's education but cannot be seen as a necessity such that the state must fund it.
On the other hand, basic education is a necessity that should be accessible to all. The statistics suggest that it is not adequately offered, particularly to students at charter schools, where a student's education is funded $2,749 less than his education would be if he attended a mainstream school. A 2009 study by the Alliance for Excellent Education found that only 58 percent of high school students will graduate high school, and a 2006 study by the National Center for Education Statistics found that only 60 percent of those graduates will go on to attend college. Meanwhile, the Alliance for Excellent Education predicts that high school dropouts “will cost Florida almost $25.3 billion in lost wages over their lifetimes." These numbers demonstrate a problem that needs to be addressed immediately. International study, while a valuable experience, is not nearly as pressing an issue.
It is unfortunate that a logical budget cut originated from an attempt to curb the liberties of professors and students. The original copy of the law, which restricted privately funded trips, would have represented a loss of liberty if it were allowed to stand. But so long as privately funded trips are legal, the state cannot be expected to fund trips of which it does not approve. There are more than enough noble uses for the saved dollars, and there are plenty of students in Florida who would appreciate a new set of textbooks. It is far more important for a state to provide a child with the means to get to college than it is for that same state to provide her with an international study experience in a country when she gets there.

Mark D. McGwire saved the national pastime. At least, so people said just over a decade ago, when the slugger engaged in the most prolific homerun chase in baseball history. At stake was the single-season homerun record, a mark set in 1961 by Roger E. Maris. At the plate was a superstar who, with every fence-clearing swing, enraptured the nation and revived fervor for Major League Baseball.
And we were duped. The steroids scandal broke, and the fairytales on the diamond turned out to be as artificial as McGwire’s biceps. We wanted to believe everything we saw on the field was organic. When we were told otherwise, fans felt angry, disillusioned, and, worst of all, deceived. Nothing in baseball could be trusted to be “real” anymore in a sport so fraught with juicers. These cheaters had tainted the game, bent the rules, and corrupted the most sacred statistic in all of baseball: the homerun.
Many asked how this perversion of the game could have occurred. But upon further inspection of the baseball’s history, one would do better asking, “What else is new?” In other words, cheating has always existed in Major League Baseball.
Why are steroids bad for baseball? The most natural response would be that they are performance-enhancing drugs, so using them would be cheating. But we say that as if “cheating” is a recent development novel to the steroid era. This erroneous argument neglects the prevalence of amphetamines used by ballplayers in the 70s and 80s to stay focused, alert, and energized over the course of a season. It also discounts the countless spitballers, scuffballers, and sign-stealers who doctored the game to their advantages in the game’s earlier eras. Cheating in baseball far predates steroid use, an important piece of background deserving of extra consideration as we grapple with this issue.
Following McGwire as he passed names like Ruth and Maris made us feel like we were witnessing the once-considered impossible. But magic has been proven false before. Thorough investigation of the 1951 season essentially proved that the underdog New York Giants, who completed an improbable comeback against the rival Brooklyn Dodgers to win the league championship, instituted an elaborate system of sign-stealing at their home stadium to pick up on their opponents’ strategies. The greatest come-from-behind story in baseball history was an illusion, made possible not by grit but by good, old-fashioned fraud.
Others may argue that the numbers put up during the steroids saga are sullied, hence giving rise to the era of the asterisked record. As baseball purists clamor for a disclaimer next to Barry Bonds’s all-time homerun record, some feel that PEDs have permanently altered the dynamics of the game. However, a recently released report by Eric Walker entitled Steroids, Other “Drugs,” and Baseball, provides evidence to the contrary. Walker makes a convincing case that the statistical influence of steroid use as an independent variable is barely significant, at best. He then shows that factors such as closer fences, better bats, and livelier baseballs have a demonstrable impact on power hitting. We have a situation in which we may be pointing fingers at the wrong people. Therefore, it is entirely feasible that juiced-up sluggers may not be entirely to blame for the recent power surge in the game. At fault could be, for instance, the baseball commissioners who institute a jumpier ball and the team owners who build ballparks with shorter fences. As evidence for these claims mounts, we must account for its validity and adjust our perception of steroids accordingly.
As it stands now, the debate on performance-enhancing drugs is frustratingly closed-minded and leaves little room for alternative considerations, perspectives, and evidence. We decry cheating in baseball as if it’s a recent phenomenon. We recoil at the naïve misconception that this generation of baseball fans is the first to witness such a shameless desecration. But we are not uniquely betrayed by the game; in fact, Walker’s report makes a strong case that we were deceived not by the likes of McGwire but the men behind the scenes who control the parameters of the game. Cheating has always existed in baseball, and it then turns out that steroids, in their minimal capacity to enhance performance, may not provide a material advantage at all at all. This is a frightening truth that baseball and its fans must accept if the steroids discussion is to advance in any constructive direction.

Nowadays, Iran is once again front page news. By having Russian experts load fuel into their first nuclear power plant, the Iranian government is once again thumbing its nose at the West. Iranian officials including President Ahmadinajad and the Defense Minister  Ahmad Wahidi have been launching barrages of threats against Israel and Western states in anticipation of either strong reaction or worse air strikes. The recent statement by John R. Bolton, former U.S. Ambassador to the UN, in which he tells the Israelis that the time to bomb the Iranian nuclear facilities is now, otherwise they will risk the dangers of a major humanitarian catastrophe due to nuclear radiation, made the Iranians more jittery than ever. Because of these and other developments in this volatile region I decided to try my hand at the subject, particularly concerning what might happen if the nuclear facilities in Iran are bombed by the U.S. or Israel and possibly involving other Western states such as France and England. However I cannot promise you the veracity of Zbigniew Kazimierz Brzezinski, the former U.S. National Security Advisor who is said to have predicted the impending demise of the Soviet Union. Nor would I pretend to possess Nostadamus’ capacity to  predict the fate of our nemesis by intentionally calling the country Persia instead of Iran so as to cause people to conjure up images of adorable, cuddly cats and expensive hand-woven rugs instead of a menacing place armed to the teeth with missiles and other military hardware with names culled directly from the Muslim’s holy Quran  such as “shihab” or  comet, “sijjil” meaning red hot clay-stones and “zilzal” a reference to earthquakes which can also allude to an impending day of judgment.
Having been forthright concerning the extent of my intellectual reach, I would like to invite you to keep reading and be the judge of what I have to say after all. We all know that the West and particularly the U.S., France, and Germany have enough warheads to wipe out many Iranian facilities suspected of being incubators for enriching uranium. On the other hand, nobody knows for sure whether the Iranians are actually trying to produce weapon grade uranium, and if so, how far are they from doing so and eventually mounting nuclear war heads atop of the short and long range rockets that they already have. Even though the idea of surgical nuclear strikes is already on the table as far the Pentagon is concerned, let us for the sake of sounding reasonable assume that the two sides trusted each other enough to slug it out using conventional weapons which means throw every heavy weapon that can cause maximum damage including the famed bunker busters by team USA, at each other in the hope of avoiding a nuclear holocaust or worse the long awaited and anticipated Armageddon. By the way, Iran as a Shi’a nation has its own version of an Armageddon except in their scenario they are the good guys who are doomed to suffer but eventually come up on top.
Now let us look at the two scenarios just to see the pros and cons of either conventional or nuclear confrontations. In the event that either the U.S. or Israel or both launch preemptive air strikes on Iran and successfully destroy all or most of the nuclear facilities I would think that a hostile act of that nature would naturally irritate the Iranians and put a damper on the United Nations’ efforts to reach a peaceful resolution to the crisis.  Even Ban Ki-moon’s job description in this case will slightly change from presiding over the negotiations between the two rivals to shuttling between the combatants in the hope of breaking up the fight before it spirals out of control. However, based on my modest knowledge of human nature I would think that if the Iranians are able to hunker down and withstand the initial massive air strikes, they will start thinking about revenge for the slight that was dealt their country and their macho image among foe and friend. Having given their word not to use nuclear weapons whether they actually have them or they are simply bluffing, they will, never the less start lobbing their missiles with conventional war heads or worse at every perceived enemy in the vicinity including but not limited to Israel, the coalition forces in Iraq, the Gulf States hosting American and European military and naval forces, and airbases such as Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and others. The Iranian propaganda machine has been telling everybody that would listen about having long and short range missiles trained on targets in their cross hair including military and civilian installations, naval vessels and oil tankers crisscrossing the Persian Gulf not to mention oil wells and oil facilities.
The above scenario would sound like child play when compared to the second scenario in which the U.S., Israel, and possibly Iran end up using nuclear weapons so as not to prolong an unwanted and an unpopular war at home and abroad. If  so, the Middle East, which is talked about as being the cradle of civilization and the birth place of world religions could become the stage upon which a world calamity of immeasurable devastation and suffering would take place. A nuclear exchange in that part of the world especially if it is not contained immediately would force other nations including those with nuclear capabilities to take sides and a so called limited war becomes truly “the war that ends all wars” thus taking the title away from World War I. I am sure I am not alone in hoping that the stalemate in the negotiations between the West and Iran over its nuclear program will be overcome and that both sides will resort to reason and their common humanity thereby avoiding the devastation of either scenario.

To many, it may seem counterintuitive to label the 2010 midterm election campaign “The Year of the Moderate.” Most of the commentary about the upcoming election has focused exclusively on the waxing influence of the Tea Party movement and the rise of raving, rightwing fundamentalists of the ilk of senatorial candidates Joe W. Miller of Alaska, Ken Buck of Colorado, and Marco A. Rubio of Florida. However, drowned out by the din of the teabag-wielding rabbles and the foaming-at-the-mouth Republican nominees is the promise of the return of the fabled moderate Republican.
The inevitable upshot of the Grand Old Party’s burgeoning electoral prospects has been a renewed competitiveness in the traditionally Democratic states California, Washington, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Delaware. The mistake many commentators make by fixating on the more colorful standard-bearers for the minority party’s midterm election effort is to assume that their agendas, and not those of moderate, blue-state candidates, will define the behavior of a Republican Congress. White House senior adviser David M. Axelrod, for example, said that “this could go one step beyond the policies of the Bush administration to something more extreme than we have seen.”
This, however, is unlikely to happen. To begin with, freshmen senators typically have little power, the unique position of Senator Scott P. Brown of Massachusetts as the pivotal 60th vote needed to pass any legislation being a rare exception. The new crop of legislators elected in November will not be chairing any congressional committees, which means that, if House Minority Leader John A. Boehner gets his way and strengthens the power of the committees, they will not be writing much legislation, either.
Furthermore, if the Republicans do indeed seize power in November, they will, as a result of their victory, be forced to govern, whether they like it or not. Much of the president’s current agenda-setting power stems from his party’s control of Congress. Should they relinquish that control, then part of the responsibility to set a governing agenda will fall to the Republicans. If Republicans actually hope to get any of the items on their agenda passed, then they will have to work with Congressional Democrats, not to mention President Barack H. Obama.
Much of the reason for the dearth of bipartisanship in the first two years of the Obama presidency has been its redundancy. With a muscular majority in the House of Representatives and a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate for much of the current administration, there simply was little incentive for the handful of remaining Republican moderates to moderate. All of the pressure, instead, was on centrist Democrats like Senator Ben E. Nelson of Nebraska and Senator Evan B. Bayh of Indiana. However, with an enlarged faction of moderates, there will be far more political cover to reach across the aisle. It will also be far more challenging for the leaderships of both parties to keep their wayward centrists in line with so many more of them.
Obviously, this calculus could be complicated by the impending massacre of moderate Democrats, which could theoretically compensate for the expansion of the Republican center. However, there is an undeniable difference between the two parties that cannot be ignored: The Democrats are the more moderate of the two parties. This is not to say necessarily that the Republican Party is more ideologically extreme than the Democratic Party, which is a somewhat more controversial claim. It is to say that there are more conservatives than liberals in this country, and in order to counterbalance this reality, Democratic Party, as the numbers reveal, is more moderate in composition.
According to the Pew Research Center, moderates composed 44 percent of the 2008 electorate, conservatives composed 34 percent, and liberals composed 22 percent. President Obama received the votes of 60 percent of moderates, 20 percent of conservatives, and 88 percent of liberals. His total share of the popular vote was 53 percent, and when one does the math, the true nature of Obama’s coalition reveals itself. Fifty percent of Obama’s voters were moderates, 13 percent were conservatives, and 37 percent were liberals. Even after the coming maiming in November, it is thus likely that the Democratic base will still hold less sway over their party’s congressional delegation than the Republican base enjoys over its.
Nevertheless, with fewer moderates in the party, Washington Democrats’ relationship with their liberal base will unavoidably change. However, it will likely change in favor of moderation. In the wake of the likely loss of the lower house of Congress and possibly the upper house as well, liberals will find it more difficult to indulge in their lazy excoriations of their party leadership for declining to steamroll the opposition. Instead, they will be facing a revived Republican Party with real power and a real agenda. A Speaker Boehner would then be far easier for liberals to demonize than Speaker Nancy P. Pelosi. The ensuing solidarity between Democratic moderates and Democratic liberals could give the moderates greater cover to compromise enough to win Republican votes.
The irony of 2010 is that a Republican rout could engender a centrist, not conservative, renaissance. Such a phenomenon could revive not only President Obama’s moribund “New Politics” but also, if he too seizes the moderate moment as President William J. Clinton did following the 1994 Republican triumph, his flagging presidency.

City Manager Robert W. Healy earned the highest salary of Cambridge’s employees in 2009 with a figure of $326,944.07, according to information recently obtained by the Cambridge Chronicle.
On the roster of 274 city employees who earned more than $100,000 in 2009, Deputy City Manager Richard C. Rossi came in second with a salary topping $270,000.
Deputy Superintendent of Teaching and Learning Carolyn L. Turk, Fire Chief Gerald R. Reardon, and Police Commissioner Robert C. Haas rounded out the top five earners, earning between $175,000 and $185,000.
The Chronicle reported that Healy is one of the highest paid chief executives of a city in Massachusetts, pointing out that the mayor of Boston earned $170,000 after taking a pay cut in 2009.
Cambridge city councillors each earned approximately $70,000 last year. E. Denise Simmons, who served as mayor until November of 2009, earned $107,132.76 last year.
Cambridge City Councillor Leland Cheung said that a comparison between Healy, who has served as Cambridge’s manager since 1981, and a mayor of another town might be a flawed analogy. Instead, Cheung said, Healy plays a role similar to that of a CEO of a corporation, and his salary is similar to others in that position.
“I don’t necessarily believe that a professional city manager’s salary in comparison with a mayor’s is neccesarily a valid comparison,” Healy said in an interview with The Crimson. “This is a $500 million corporation that I happen to be the chief executive of, and that salary is not out of line.”
But some citizens were skeptical of the high salaries paid to public employees in Cambridge.
“Seventy-five thousand dollars is what people need for happiness. Anything over $100,000 in public service is excessive,” said North Cambridge resident Neil W. McCabe. “Three years into this economic crisis, it’s unfortunate that people making so much money at public expense haven’t taken the lead to show what they’re willing to sacrifice.”
He added that while a “huge class” of city employees earn excessive salaries, “regular people” who are not part of the political or public service elite struggle to pay their bills.
“They have a piano on their back that’s the city of Cambridge,” McCabe said.
But Healy said that while “there are always naysayers,” most citizens are not upset by the city’s payroll.
“In general the public is content with the operation of the city government, and these are salaries that are reasonable for the services delivered,” he said.
Echoing Healy’s sentiment, Cheung said that the city manager in particular deserves his paycheck, citing Cambridge’ low unemployment rate and flourishing business scene as evidence of “the professional manner” in which Healy runs the city.
“To me, the fact that he’s bringing in jobs for people is worth what we’re paying him,” Cheung said.
While Healy’s pay is determined by the City Council, he said that he is responsible for assigning the salaries of most other city employees. Many employees, he noted, are members of unions which engage in collective bargaining to arrive at their pay rates.
The chart compiled by the Chronicle shows that police officers made anywhere from $54,000 to just over $145,000; fire fighters were paid $47,000 to $95,500; and teachers earned between $20,800 and $106,500 in 2009. Over 2,100 city employees were paid more that $20,000 during the year.

Flying insect-like robots that would be able to navigate situations too dangers for humans—such as environmental hazards and forest fires—are one step closer to becoming a reality.
Researchers at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences recently completed the construction of an essential mechanism that allows the microbot to automatically adjust imbalances of the wings caused by natural impediments like wind.
“I am quite excited,” said Pratheev S. Sreetharan, lead author of the study and a graduate student at SEAS. “We are the only lab in the world that can build an upscale robotic insect.”
The mechanism, which weighs around 10 milligrams and is roughly the size of Abraham Lincoln’s face on a penny, obviates the use of a computer microchip.
By allowing the microbot to flap its wings asymmetrically in the event of turbulence, the central device is analogous to a car differential, which splits the torque so that the wheels can move at different speeds when the car makes a turn.
The research team parted from traditional approaches to the field of Flapping Wing Micro-Air Vehicles—which extensively uses electrical sensors and computer chips—by replacing electronic controls with “highly sophisticated” mechanics that adjust the wing speed and amplitude.
Microrobots have very little power and mass available for electronic sensors and chips, according to Sreetharan.
The microbotic research is part of the RoboBees Project, a larger initiative funded by the National Science Foundation that seeks to artificially mimic the behaviors of a bee colony and deftly adapt to changing environments.
“We’ve been using insights from biology as shortcuts to engineering,” said Associate Engineering Professor and study co-author Robert J. Wood in a 2007 interview, when he first announced the start of the project. “Hovering is the most attractive feature for application...Surveillance, for example, requires the machine to hover and stare.”
“This is a pretty ambitious project,” Sreetharan said.

The Institute of Politics introduced a diverse group of fall 2010 Resident Fellows last night, including a former chief of police, a former prime minister of Haiti and a former secretary of education.
The conversation, led by IOP Interim Director John C. Culver ’54, allowed the fellows to answer questions about their time in politics and public service, as well as share words of wisdom and advice with attendees.
Culver asked the fellows what inspired them to be involved in politics. Dennis W. Archer, a former Mich. Supreme Court justice and the mayor of Detroit from 1994 to 2001, explained, “Politics is all around us, especially in our everyday lives.” Archer said that while on the Court he read about gangs in Detroit and the businesses leaving the city. He felt a calling to make conditions better, so he ran for mayor, and won.
Michèle D. Pierre-Louis, the prime minister of Haiti from 2008 to 2009, on the other hand, was less enthused about politics. She explained that because she grew up in a Haiti ruled by a dictator, she acquired the sense that politics should be avoided because it did not help the public interest or common good.
But, after years of being asked to enter the political world, she agreed to be in former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide’s private cabinet in 1991, a position she held for only seven months. Pierre-Louis stayed away from politics until she became prime minister in 2008.
“I became prime minister with a sense of engagement, a sense that I had to make a difference, had to look at things differently, and had to project a different image of women in politics in Haiti,” Pierre-Louis said. After a little over a year as prime minister, Pierre-Louis said she faced pressure to run for president in Haiti, but instead left the country.
Other Resident Fellows this semester are Susan Milligan, a former political reporter; Ophir Pines-Paz, Israel’s minister of the internal affairs in 2005; Margaret Spellings, secretary of education from 2005 to 2009 and John Timoney, the Miami chief of police from 2003 to 2009.
These fellows will be leading study groups throughout the fall semester. The IOP will host an open house on Friday from 2 to 4 p.m., where students can meet the fellows and learn about fall programming.

A male graduate student walking on Memorial Drive near Akron Street was the victim of an armed robbery at approximately 11:30 p.m. on Sunday, according to a community advisory report issued yesterday by the Harvard University Police Department.
The victim alleged that a man riding a bicycle stopped him on the street, demanding all of his money while flashing a handgun.
The student said that he handed over all of his money, and the robber fled the area. The victim was unharmed during the incident, according to the advisory report.
Because the crime occurred along the Charles River and not on Harvard’s campus, it is under investigation by the Massachusetts State Police. HUPD will collaborate with the state police if asked, according to HUPD spokesman Steven G. Catalano.
To avoid being the victim of armed robbery, students should avoid walking at night and instead make use of Harvard’s shuttle bus and evening van service, Catalano wrote in an e-mailed statement.
“If students insist on walking they should walk in groups and along well-lit and well-traveled routes (designated pathways),” Catalano wrote. “In addition, when walking students should pay attention to their surroundings and not be distracted by listening to music or talking on cell phones.”
Last month, the Cambridge Police Department issued a report that stated that crime in the city is at a 40-year low.
Violent crime in Cambridge has dropped 58 percent since its peak in 1990, with only 449 incidents reported in 2009, the second lowest number in four decades, according to the report.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Thanks in part to a “moderate” property tax increase, the City of Cambridge has avoided major cutbacks, according to numbers released in the most recent city budget, as well as City Manager Robert W. Healy.
The city’s operating budget is almost $460 million for the 2011 fiscal year, a 3.1 percent increase from the 2010 fiscal year. Both reduction in state aid and increase in city expenses—such as employee salaries and pension packages—have contributed to the overall budgetary increase.
“The budget is very strong and stable,” Healy said. “We have been able to retain personnel in public works and there haven’t been any significant service reductions, largely due to controlled expenditures.”
This year’s budget saw a 3 percent increase in salaries for employees, a 7.4 percent increase in employee health insurance, and a 3 percent increase in employee pension costs. Other significant cost increases include debt service costs, which have risen 4.6 percent.
To cover the rising costs in the face of continued reduction in state aid, the city has predominantly had to increase property tax, according to Healy. The current budget calls for a moderate 6.3 percent increase in the property tax; last fiscal year, the city raised property taxes 5.9 percent.
Cambridge currently receives approximately 62 percent of its revenue from property taxes, according its 2011 budget. This places a very heavy burden on municipal funding, said City Councillor Leland Cheung. The amount appropriated from the property tax-supported debt has increased from $1 million to $7.2 million in the 2011 fiscal year budget to fund surface improvement projects in Harvard and Kendall Squares, in addition to the first phase of the Harvard Square Tunnel Improvement Project.
The city has had to reduce 28 full-time positions over the past seven years, although Healy said these cuts have made way for operational and programmatic staffing for major facilities that have opened during that time.
Healy and Cheung maintain optimistic attitudes towards the cuts and increases in this year’s budget.
“We are not facing many of the problems you’ll find across America,” Cheung said. “The most surprising aspect of this budget is how fortunate we are here in Cambridge to be doing as well as we are.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust announced yesterday that she would continue to support stem-cell research at Harvard in spite of a recent court ruling that threatens to cut off federal funding for research involving human embryos, writing that “the promise of stem cell science is at risk of becoming a dream deferred.”
Late yesterday the effort to restore federal funding suffered a set-back in federal court after a judge denied an emergency request by the National Institutes of Health for a stay to the injunction, shutting the flow of federal funds while the case works its way through the legal system.
“We hope that the temporary injunction will soon be lifted and that Congress will take the steps necessary to ensure that stem cell scientists can carry on their work vigorously and responsibly, in the interests of the millions of people who may someday enjoy its benefits,” Faust wrote in a statement.
Harvard, through its membership in the Coalition for the Advancement of Medical Research, filed an amicus brief in the case that said that irreparable harm would be done to research efforts unless the injunction is stayed, a move that would allow funding to continue while the case is further appealed.
Judge Royce C. Lamberth ruled in August that the 1995 Dickey-Wicker Amendment prohibits the federal government from participating in research that includes the destruction of human embryos.
“Congress has mandated that the public interest is served by preventing taxpayer funding of research that entails the destruction of human embryos,” Lamberth wrote in yesterday’s denial of the stay.
Harvard scientists, several of whom are heavily involved in stem cell research, have lamented the court ruling and have said it would delay medical advances.
The ruling cuts off funding for research that involves embryonic stem cells but would not ban the research outright, which can continue so long as it is privately funded.
“For this science to go forward requires the full involvement of the federal government,” said Douglas A. Melton, co-chair of the Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology and co-director of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute. “The consequence of the injunction staying in place is that it would slow down medical advances.”
Faust recently visited Melton’s lab, where she expressed her commitment to continuing Harvard’s involvement in stem-cell research.
“Harvard strongly supports its stem cell researchers,” she wrote.
Yesterday’s decision to deny the request for an injunction sets the stage for further litigation.
“Today’s Federal District Court injunction halting federal funding for human embryonic stem cell research is a blow to the hopes of millions of patients and their families suffering from fatal and chronic diseases and disorders,” said Lisa Hughes, the president of CAMR.
According to Melton, the question of federal funding to human embryonic stem cell research must be solved with a legislative solution. The Dickey-Wicker Amendment was passed before the discovery of human embryonic stem cells, and as a result, Melton said, is out of touch with current science.

A new federal law requires Harvard and other publicly funded universities to post the prices and ISBNs of course books online.
At Harvard, this information is now available on the Harvard Coop’s website, which Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesman Jeff Neal said puts the University in compliance with the new law.
The law, which was passed by Congress 2008 before taking effect this year, is intended to lessen the financial burden of university students buying course books.
“[T]hey’re trying to make the retail market more competitive and make it easier for students to find the cheapest price of a particular book,” said Ian Ayres, professor at Yale Law School, who recently wrote a New York Times blog post about the new law.
The law, which is part of the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008, states that the information must be posted “on the institution’s Internet course schedule and in a manner of the institution’s choosing.”
At community colleges, textbooks can account for up to 40 percent of the cost of attending college, according to Ayres.
“This isn’t such a problem at Harvard, where textbooks cost probably less than 5 percent of the cost of getting a Harvard education,” he added.
Harvard professors interviewed by The Crimson about the new requirements were critical of the law, calling it an example of federal overreach.
“I have no objection to posting the price of course materials. But as matter of personal political philosophy, I am skeptical about the federal government micromanaging such decisions,” N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard economics  professor and the author of a popular introductory textbook, wrote in an e-mail to The Crimson.
Another Harvard professor had a tongue-in-cheek response to the law.
“We wait breathlessly for the federal government to prescribe mandatory potty-breaks every 15 minutes during classes. Lobbyists from Procter and Gamble are no doubt already working on the legislation,” History Professor James Hankins wrote in an e-mail.
Hankins’ course History 1300 “Western Intellectual History: Greco Roman-Antiquity” requires students to purchase 11 textbooks.
Manuel J. Antunes ’11, a history concentrator, said he supports the law’s focus on textbook costs.
“I think posting them [textbook prices] online will definitely help to figure out where to get better prices for books,” he said. “I now do everything on Amazon because it’s just ridiculous [at the Coop].”
But even Ayres, who has made proposals aimed at lowering the price of textbooks, had reservations about the law.
“Overall, I admire the legislative attempt, but I’m skeptical that it will have much of an impact,” he said. “The law may produce an interesting competitive effect where teachers actually compete for students by assigning lower price textbooks.”
Besides requiring colleges to publicly list the price of textbooks, the law also mandates that publishers detail changes between successive revisions to textbooks.

CORRECTION: September 8, 2010
Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this Sept. 8 news article was originally titled "Law Requires Coop to Post Prices Online." In fact, the new law requires Harvard University, not the Coop, to post the prices and ISBNs of course books online.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration will consider a petition filed in part by Harvard Medical School Professors Charles A. Czeisler ’74 and Christopher P. Landrigan seeking to lower the nationwide limit on the number of hours that medical residents can work per week.
In a petition submitted on Sept. 2, Czeisler and Landrigan—along with Albert Einstein College of Medicine Professor Bertrand M. Bell, consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, the Committee of Interns and Residents, and the American Medical Student Association—expressed concerns about the consequences of current extreme work conditions.
“Studies have shown that residents [who were working more than 20 hour shifts] made 36 percent more errors,” Czeisler said. “24-hour shifts have been shown to be associated with mistakes that injured a patient.”
Addressing OSHA Assistant Secretary David Michaels, the petition recommended limiting resident physicians’ shift to a maximum of 16 consecutive hours and scheduling at least one 24-hour period of time off of work per week.
The petitioners noted that under current regulations, an average work week for a medical resident could average 66.6 hours with extended shifts often lasting 29.9 hours.
Although regulations currently exist, 83.6 percent of all interns reported work hours in violation of the standards set by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, the organization overseeing resident physician training.
Czeisler said that he has been concerned about this issue since legislation in New York limited work hours for medical residents in the 1980s. Harvard led a commission to establish guidelines for Massachusetts medical schools to limit the number of resident work hours, but this self-regulating system did not produce substantial change, Czeisler said.
Michaels wrote in a statement on Sept. 2 that the petitioners’ concerns will be thoroughly examined.
“We are very concerned about medical residents working extremely long hours, and we know of evidence linking sleep deprivation with an increased risk of needle sticks, puncture wounds, lacerations, medical errors and motor vehicle accidents,” he said.
“Hospitals and medical training programs are not exempt from ensuring that their employees’ health and safety are protected.”

University staff roped off sections of the Science Center yesterday to limit student crowds for the second lecture of Science of the Physical Universe 27, “Science and Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to the Science of Soft Matter,” and the course’s first public lecture also drew a large audience to Loeb Drama Center yesterday evening.
The buzzed-about General Education course, which explores the physical and chemical properties of matter using cooking science, has attracted overflow crowds ahead of the results of its student lottery, which will be released today.
Students spilled outside the Science Center yesterday afternoon to see guest lectures from world-renowned chefs Ferran Adrià and José R. Andrés and prominent food author Harold McGee. Those not among the 350 allowed into Science Center Hall C were directed to additional classrooms that provided a simulcast feed.
For the chefs, the lecture was the beginning of what they say they hope will become a larger trend, which Andrés, who manages several award-winning restaurants across the U.S., called in an interview “the great synergy between physics and cooking.”
Andrés, who left school at fourteen but soon after joined Adrià in his kitchen, said that he never stopped being “highly interested in learning.”
“To come from that and now be teaching at Harvard—it’s very humbling,” Andrés said.
Andrés added that the two chefs view eating as one of the two essential activities that humans participate in each day, the other being breathing. “Breathing is boring, but food is more than just a social event,” Andrés said.
Andrés and Adrià consistently repeated their belief that innovative approaches to cooking can solve many of the issues that food is believed to create, such as hunger, obesity and even environmental damage.
Andrés cited a quotation from noted gastronomic philosopher Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin: “The future of nations will depend on how they feed themselves.”
“If we take that phrase and bring it up to the highest meaning and possibility, what we see today is teaching cooking as a science is part of this vision,” Andrés said.
In the lecture, both chefs maintained that cooking is a high science, worthy of as much study as history or biology.
“When you go to a museum, why [are] there only artifacts and still-life[s]?” Adrià asked through a translator during the student lecture. “Why aren’t there dishes on display?”
At the end of the lecture, Adrià  provided a demonstration of ”spherification,” the process of gelatinizing the outside of a liquid droplet in order to create an edible, fluid-filled capsule.
Adrià, Andrés and McGee reunited yesterday evening to give a lecture open to the general public following an introduction from College Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds and School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Dean Cherry A. Murray.
“I want to come out as a foodie and also a scientist, so this is like heaven for me,” said Hammonds, who holds advanced degrees in physics and the history of science.
Murray spoke briefly about Harvard’s history of involvement in the food science research, a topic explored more fully in McGee’s lecture, which centered on worldwide developments in food science since the end of the 17th century.
In his later speech, Adrià again articulated the need for creativity, innovation and scientific rigor in the cooking industry.
“Today we are not really studying cooking and the meaning of cooking in our society,” Adrià said, adding that it is “unbelievably important that cooking got into the most important university in the world.”
The chef went on to describe his plans for transforming his primary eatery, El Bulli, from a restaurant into a “center for creativity” in order to help advance the field of cooking science.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During a pre-trial conference held at the Middlesex Superior Court yesterday, Adam B. Wheeler, the former Harvard student who pled not guilty to charges of fabricating his academic history, learned that his next hearing date has been set for Nov. 8.
Wheeler, who did not attend his first pre-trial conference in June, was present at the court in Woburn today, according to Middlesex District Attorney Spokeswoman Cara O’Brien.
On May 18, Wheeler pled not guilty to 20 counts of larceny, identity fraud, falsifying an endorsement or approval, and pretending to hold a degree. Prosecutors allege that Wheeler submitted plagiarized letters of recommendations, fake transcripts, and fraudulent SAT scores in his transfer application to Harvard in 2007.
In the fall of 2009, he was apprehended by Harvard disciplinary officials and later by police when he allegedly submitted fraudulent documents in his applications for the Rhodes and Fulbright Scholarships.
Wheeler, who transferred to Harvard in 2007 as a sophomore, was a resident of Kirkland House and won a Hoopes prize in his junior year for a paper that was later found to be plagiarized.
In his application for transfer admission to Harvard, Wheeler claimed to have earned perfect grades as a high school student at prestigious preparatory school Phillips Academy in Andover and as a first-year student at MIT. In fact, he had attended public high school in Delaware and was a sophomore at Bowdoin facing suspension for academic dishonesty.
After leaving Harvard in the fall of his senior year rather than facing a disciplinary hearing about his academic dishonesty, Wheeler applied for transfer admission to Yale, Brown, Stanford, and the Seaport Maritime Studies Program of Williams College. He was accepted by Williams and Stanford before the universities learned of the criminal charges against him.
Wheeler, a native of Delaware, is not permitted to leave Massachusetts before his trial, which is scheduled to begin on Feb. 7.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Boston Redevelopment Authority held a community meeting last night to discuss for the second time a proposal to relocate Western Ave.’s McDonald’s 75 feet from its current Harvard-owned location in the Brighton Mills shopping center.
The proposal to relocate McDonald’s was filed with the Boston Redevelopment Authority on July 29. If approved, the restaurant at 360 Western Ave. would move east, closer to the street, to accommodate the extension of Telford St. The expanded street would provide an efficient drive-through lane for McDonald’s customers.
According to Louis Miller, the lawyer representing The Community Builders, Inc. a development firm working on relocating McDonald’s, the project, approved in January, is currently ahead of schedule.
The Allston residents who attended the meeting continued to express the same reservations they did at the first meeting about the relocation, which took place on Aug. 12.
“The redevelopment of McDonald’s has not considered the six years of urban design and community planning for all of Western Ave.,” said Jane McHale, an Allston resident. “This single-story, stand-alone building will [affect] the design aspects of everything around it, and that is a travesty to the community and to the BRA.” Residents had been hoping for a multi-story development instead.
During both meetings, representatives for McDonald’s said that the drive-through accounts for 60 to 70 percent of the restaurant’s business.
Both Harvard and the Charlesview Board of Directors have advocated the relocation. Through a land swap deal with the University, the Board plans to move residents out of the current Charlesview residential complex, which comprises 213 aging low-income housing units located across from the University’s Allston Science Complex construction site, to a yet-to-be constructed neighborhood approximately half mile away.
“The proposal will bring Charlesview residents closer to the day when they will enjoy new and improved housing,” wrote University spokeswoman Lauren M. Marshall in an e-mailed statement last month. She noted that moving McDonald’s is a preparatory step in the process of building the new Charlesview residence because it will make the new location more accessible.
But some residents, who made it clear at the meeting that their concern was not related to McDonald’s as a business, placed the blame on Harvard for not investing in improving the neighborhood.
“Harvard has lost all interest in developing in Allston in any way that will be conducive to their presence here,” Brent Whelan ’73 said after the meeting. “There is no enlightened development... The worst possible message is neglect and cheap solutions.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Sept. 22, 2007, I zipped up my Coop-purchased Harvard hoodie and trekked across the Charles for the first night game in school history.
That football game against Brown was the first major school event of my college years, and I clung to my pack of Freshman Week friends like a worried puppy.
The game itself—a 24-17 Crimson victory—was not all that memorable, but, for me, it gave shape to Harvard and provided substance to the nebulous notion of belonging to a community.
Flash forward to this past weekend. I felt a wave of recognition, seeing the faces of freshmen at Soldiers Field Soccer Stadium.
It carried me back to that day three years ago when Harvard was still an unopened oyster. It also filled me with a sense of gratitude in one particular respect: thank goodness for night games.
Since installing lights at Harvard Stadium in 2007, the Athletic Department has continued to expand its nocturnal initiative, and the results have been unequivocally positive.
Football’s annual opening home game, which takes place at night (and falls on Saturday, Sept. 18, this year), has been hugely popular—easily the most well-attended contest other than The Game.
Last spring’s men’s lacrosse game against Duke was a big success as well; students were so wrapped up in the occasion, they hardly minded the 14-5 drubbing.
Considering the success of this past weekend’s soccer match, it seems Harvard students cannot get enough of night games.
It’s tough to explain the allure of these events. Even as a Little Leaguer, mired in the cellar of the standings with the Westwood Cardinals, night games held special importance.
Maybe it’s a narcissistic love of the spotlight. Maybe it’s an irrational fear of the sun. In any case, these games provide a sense of occasion that’s absent from ordinary contests.
Watching the crowd at last Saturday’s soccer game, the result of this enthusiasm was obvious.
Chants of “Let’s Go Harvard!” echoed between the stands and the knoll. Several vuvuzelas droned—a kitschy reminder of this summer’s World Cup. Students wandered through the crowd, greeting friends and catching up after a prolonged vacation.
It was a party to which everyone was invited, and, for a student body that’s often fractured into different social cliques, it was a rare moment of unity.
Not only that, the crowd seemed to lift the Crimson soccer team. After a Stanford own goal gave Harvard an early 1-0 lead, the Cardinal responded at the start of the second half with a score of its own.
And yet, the game never seemed to be in doubt. The moment seemed too big for the Crimson to possibly not win.
Sophomore Brian Rogers’ nifty finish in the 80th minute was the inevitable conclusion for what was a magical night, as No. 10 Harvard prevailed with a 2-1 victory over No. 13 Stanford.
Once again, as Saturday’s win proved, a night game was a winning formula both socially and athletically (the football team has won its last three home openers). So let’s have more of them.
I want to see more kickoffs after dark.
I want to see a first pitch under the lights.
I want our hockey team to take on Cornell outdoors like Boston College and Boston University did at Fenway Park last winter.
I want the Head of the Charles to outrun the twilight.
The Athletic Department has made huge strides with this initiative in the last three years, and I hope they keep pushing.
Perhaps, in night games, they have found a way to make athletics more relevant on campus and an integral part of the undergraduate experience.

With one minute to go in Sunday afternoon’s game against New Hampshire, the Harvard women’s soccer team is up 2-0­—an advantage that might seem perfectly safe had the Crimson not surrendered an identical lead two days before.
As time ticks away, Wildcat midfielder Cassie Guerra charges the goal with a chance to cut the deficit in half.
Is this the toughest moment sophomore goaltender AJ Millet has faced so far in her collegiate career?
Not by a long shot.
That might have been when she tore her left ACL. Or perhaps when she tore her left meniscus. Or when she realized she had less than a week to get ready for her first taste of action.
This? This is easy.
Millet grabs the ball from Guerra, and Harvard rolls to its first victory of the season.
A year ago, Millet, fresh off three all-state selections and two All-New England nods, was an incoming rookie expecting to compete for playing time with the Crimson.
Instead, she tore her ACL the summer before, requiring season-ending surgery.
Rather than competing for minutes, the freshman wound up stuck on the sidelines.
“I thought it was the end of the world,” she said. “My whole life had been centered on soccer. That had been my identity.”
But the keeper focused all her efforts on rehab and recovery, and by mid-winter she was back on the field, training with her teammates.
“She’s clearly a very hard worker,” said Lauren Mann ‘10, a four-year starter for the Crimson. “Coming back from the ACL injury really shows her character.”
Meanwhile, the injury had a few unexpected benefits. A season spent redshirting gave Millet a chance to get to know her teammates without the pressure of playing.
“It’s kind of nice because she had the opportunity to get to know the team, to see the personalities,” Mann said. “She had a year where she could learn from the sidelines. When she came in, she had that leg up on someone who comes in as a freshman.”
Over the course of the spring, Millet grew stronger and stronger. She played with the team in its spring game in Italy.
Once summer rolled around, the goalie was in roughly the same position she’d been the year before: excited to get in the goal for Harvard and looking forward to four years of eligibility.
Unfortunately for Millet, the déjà vu did not stop there.
Just as before, she found herself facing a potentially season-ending injury: this time, a torn meniscus, suffered during the summer.
Once again, she needed surgery. With the season fast approaching, it looked like Millet might find herself on the sidelines again.
“I was a little scared,” junior defender Lindsey Kowal said. “We didn’t know whether she’d be able to play.”
But a week before the Crimson’s first game, Millet was cleared to play. With just five practices before the season opener, she prepared herself for the challenges of Division I soccer while working on communicating with her defense.
Millet’s first game back on the field wasn’t all that she hoped it would be.
Though she had made eight saves, the two goals she surrendered were enough to bring Harvard to a 2-2 draw with Long Island University.
Yet for an athlete who had already overcome two surgeries, a couple of goals were but a minor hiccup.
Millet and the defense worked together to improve their on-field communication, something that hurt them in the first game.
“We’ll make sure we’re on the same page, make sure the defense is pushing up,” Kowal said.
Two days after allowing the Blackbirds 10 shots, Millet and the Crimson defense were nearly perfect, allowing only three shots all game.
“We’re way more in synch than in that first span,” the goalie added. “I think that will continue.”
And when the Wildcats did manage to get shots off, Millet proved impenetrable.
“After just practicing for only five days, she did an unbelievable job,” co-captain Gina Wideroff said. “I credit her tremendously for playing as well as she did. She’s a great addition to the team.”
Teammates attribute her success to her attitude in the net.
“I want AJ back there with me,” Kowal said. “She’s been awesome. Mentally, she’s all there. Her confidence is great.”
“AJ is very vocal,” Wideroff added. “She’s really stepping into that position and taking control of the defense.”
And there’s no doubt Millet is having a ball doing it. A year and two surgeries after arriving on campus, she finally has a net to call her own.
“It felt good to step back in the goal,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It seems that all the goal-scoring responsibilities have fallen onto sophomore Brian Rogers after Andre Akpan, the Crimson’s top scorer, graduated last year.
“Brian’s biggest contributions to this team right now are on the field and in front of the goal,” Harvard coach Carl Junot said. “We’re going to continue to ask that of him over the course of the year.”
So far, the reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Year has delivered.
In gripping fashion, Rogers found the back of the net with only ten minutes left in the second half of Saturday night’s game against No. 13 Stanford. His goal was invaluable, sealing the fate of the Cardinal to a 2-1 loss.
“It was a great goal, a great individual effort,” Crimson co-captain Robert Millock said. “It started off of a counterattack so I think it was a great finish. He’s been looking for it all fall so it’s good that he finally got one.”
Rogers couldn’t contain his excitement and ran to the corner of the stadium, where he kicked the flag out of the ground and celebrated the goal with fans surrounding the fence.
He was shortly mobbed by his teammates as he slowly made his way back to the center of the field for kickoff.
Throughout the game, the sophomore showed composure in front of a crowd of 3,221 fans, even though it was clear from the start that emotions were flying high as a result of all the publicity and hype going into the game.
“The atmosphere here was great [Saturday],” Rogers said. “I have to thank the administration for putting this together and for this great stadium for us to play in. It’s everything any D-1 athlete could ever ask for, no matter where you go.”
It was no surprise then, that in front of a more modest crowd, Rogers would strike again.
Against UMass on Monday, Rogers scored the go-ahead goal right after halftime on a cross from Millock.
Tenth-ranked Harvard went on to win the match 3-2, but it was Rogers’ goal that set the tone early in the second half. The Crimson used that confidence to score another goal that would put the Minutemen well behind.
Throughout high school, Rogers was always known for his prolific ability to score goals.
In 2008, he was sixth in the nation with 44 tallies while leading his team to the state championship. He was also named the Gatorade New York State Player of the Year in 2009 for his efforts.
Rogers’ goals this year have been indispensable to the team’s current 2-0 record. In both games, Rogers broke a 1-1 deadlock to highly influence the final outcome.
Junot feels that Rogers can only get better, not only by sneaking the ball past the goalie but also by putting the game away.
“I think, specifically with our forwards and Brian, we ask a lot more on the defensive end, maybe more than other teams do,” Junot said. “So I feel Brian’s goal scoring ability will continue to improve throughout the season with repetition and what we’re going to try and teach him is to become a better defender as well.”
Against Stanford, Junot moved Rogers from smothering the Cardinal backline to playing on the right wing, using his athleticism to help the Harvard defense fend off Stanford’s final attempts on the goal.
But it is Rogers’ never-ceasing efforts to get behind the backline that have made him so successful and has even frustrated some of his teammates.
“We joke about [Rogers] in practice,” Millock said. “We get angry because he always grabs and pulls but it was nice to see him do it to someone else and have it work.”
Whatever the strategy may be, Rogers will strive to surpass last year’s tally of six goals for second on the team in goals scored. He already has two, and with 15 more games before a probable NCAA berth, Rogers’ chances are looking pretty good.

If you’ve ever succumbed to taking a cab to go home after a late-night party at the Pfoho Belltower or to get to Logan Airport for that last-minute flight, this survey is for you.
The Cambridge License Commission is conducting a survey to "determine why customers do or do not choose to use Cambridge taxi cabs." The Commission hopes that these responses will help make “the industry more consumer-friendly and competitive.”
Unfortunately, none of the answers to the multiple-choice question “Why do you usually take a taxi cab in the City of Cambridge?” include options such as “too drunk to find a shuttle” or “embarrassed to be seen during the walk of shame.” That said, the survey does offer an “Other” option for those who wish to contribute what perhaps may be a more personalized response.
The Commission is trying to figure out why people use cabs so that Cambridge can improve the industry. So if you use taxis every weekend, use them only for those nights when you’ve had a bit too much to drink and you’re stuck at MIT after the T has stopped running, or never use cabs and adhere to a strict regimen of biking and rollerblading for transport, you’d be doing your city a favor by filling it out.

If you’re like some of us here at Flyby, you may have extended your Labor Day weekend a little too far—both before and after. But even if you managed to skip all of Shopping Period until today, you definitely still have some options (and time) to fill up your study card.
Science of the Physical Universe 20: What is Life? From Quarks to Consciousness—This Gen Ed course also fulfills either Science A or B for the Core, so it should probably be a pretty flexible option for most of you. Plus, even though the class has met two times already, we know from experience that most of your learning will take place in section. So just make sure you show up to that!
Ethical Reasoning 22: Justice—This ever-popular Sandel class met once last week, but it’s not like they’ll know you weren’t there.
Computer Science 50: Introduction to Computer Science I—Missed the first lecture? Don’t worry, it’s already online, so you can catch up for the second class easily. And now that you can take it pass/fail and as a Gen Ed or Core course, it’s more attractive than ever.
English 62: Diffusions: Castaways and Renegades—Double colon in the title aside, this course doesn’t seem too complicated. The first lecture, according to the syllabus, only included an introduction and an overview. Read classics by Du Bois, Stowe, Whitman, Fitzgerald and Twain (you know you’ve always meant to). Added bonus? No midterm, no final exam.
History and Literature 90l: Stories of Slavery and Freedom—This course meets for the first time this week, and as far as we can tell, you don’t need to have prepared anything in advance. Do brace yourself for a possible crowd, however—Professor Timothy P. McCarthy is popular and the Q guide ratings are stellar.
Science of Living Systems 11: Molecules of Life—Want an easy way to kill off a Gen Ed or Core requirement? This class is your answer (for Core people, it fulfills Science B).  Professor David R. Liu and Professor Jon Clardy are sure to be a good time in this large and popular course about the small and unseen.

This sign in Cambridge Common demands a bit more interpretation than its less enigmatic counterparts. Is it a progressive political statement? An inside joke among philosophy concentrators? Or just the product of a really good night?

The QS World University Rankings do. Though they've had Harvard at the top every year since 2004, this year the University of Cambridge took home the honor.
Yale remained at number three, and University College London stayed put at number four. MIT rose four spots to round out the top five.
Though we may have lost our spot at the top for now, it still sounds like no matter how you cut it, Cambridge—on one side of the Atlantic or the other—will always be the place for a top-notch college.
