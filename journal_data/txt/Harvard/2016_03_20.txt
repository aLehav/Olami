After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 19, 2016, at 7:19 p.m.
LAKE PLACID, N.Y. — “You can’t win the championship unless you win today,” Quinnipiac men’s hockey coach Rand Pecknold said Friday night.
Despite steamrolling its way through college hockey from season’s beginning to end, Pecknold and the No. 2/2 Bobcats (28-3-7, 16-1-5) entered this year’s ECAC semifinals with some doubt hanging over their heads, as Quinnipiac had advanced to just one conference championship in 10 years since entering the ECAC in 2005.
But up against Dartmouth in the semifinals on Friday, Pecknold got the result he was after. The Bobcats scored the first three goals of the night at Herb Brooks Arena en route to a 3-1 victory over the Big Green, sending the conference frontrunners into their first title game since 2007.
Now Quinnipiac will face No. 9/9 Harvard (19-9-4, 12-6-4)—a 2-1 overtime winner in Friday’s nightcap against No. 17/- St. Lawrence—in a matchup of the ECAC’s two most prolific offenses.
“This, to me, is a great challenge for us,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “Quinnipiac has been the class of our league and the class of the country for the most part for the entire season…. But I think our guys are excited about that challenge.”
After solving one hot goaltender in Dartmouth’s Charles Grant on Friday, the Bobcats will have to solve another on Saturday. Crimson sophomore Merrick Madsen had made at least 35 saves in three of his last four games, including Friday’s win over the Saints, and has a .957 save percentage over that stretch.
But with Harvard’s defense playing undermanned this weekend, the Bobcat attack—ranked fourth in the country with 3.87 goals per game—could be poised to explode.
Crimson defenseman Wiley Sherman will miss his second consecutive game with an upper body injury. Donato will trot out the same defensive personnel that he did Friday night, as he confirmed Saturday afternoon.
“I thought our D-core gave up one goal last night and made a lot of good plays against a very strong St. Lawrence team,” Donato said. “We’ll see how the health is for everybody, but we don’t foresee too many changes.”
Freshman Adam Baughman will remain in Sherman’s place on the second defensive pair with senior Brayden Jaw, and sophomore Thomas Aiken will make another appearance on the third pairing.
The new-look Crimson blue line held St. Lawrence at bay for much of the game on Friday, but the Bobcats are a whole different monster.
While the Saints’ leading scorer was a defenseman with 12 goals, Quinnipiac features multiple 20-goal scorers, four forwards with at least 30 points, and three defensemen with at least 20 points.
Centering Quinnipiac’s top line is senior Travis St. Denis, a second-team all-ECAC honoree with 20 goals and 23 assists on the year. Fourth-liner Tim Clifton, the league’s leader in plus-minus (+24) and another second-teamer, has also emerged as a dangerous scoring threat.
But the driving force behind the Bobcat attack is junior forward Sam Anas, who leads Quinnipiac with 23 goals and 25 assists through 38 games this season. The ECAC’s leading point-getter has two scores and a helper in two games against the Crimson this year, both wins for the Bobcats—a 4-1 decision in Hamden, Conn., and a 5-4 overtime thriller at Madison Square Garden.
When Harvard and Quinnipiac did battle in last year’s ECAC semifinals here in Lake Placid, however, Anas was sidelined with a leg injury he suffered against Union in the conference quarterfinals. The Crimson opened up a 3-0 first-period lead in that contest, a game which Harvard held on to win, 5-2, behind a pair of late empty-netters.
It won’t take long for fans to spot Anas this time around, however. The junior has scored a goal in each of his two appearances at Herb Brooks Arena, most recently on the power play against Dartmouth Friday night.
Nonetheless, the Bobcats are deep enough that they do not have to rely on their biggest star. Quinnipiac boasts an offense, a defense, a power play, and a penalty kill that all rank among the top 10 respective units in the nation.
“They’re a team that tries to pressure you into making mistakes and is very good at taking advantage of them, so I think we have to be very good with the puck,” Donato said. “I think we need to use our speed and skill to go after them—not sit back on our heels, but play on our toes. We expect this to be a very hard fought game against an excellent team.”
One particular areas of concern for Harvard that Donato mentioned was puck management on the Olympic sheet. With the speed of its forward group, the Crimson is well-equipped to excel on the big ice, but Quinnipiac employs a similar quick-strike offense that should negate any advantage Harvard might be used to having on a larger ice surface.
Another area of concern for the Crimson is the absence of junior center Sean Malone, who is being held out as a precautionary measure after dealing with cramps last night, per Assistant Director of Athletic Communications Brock Malone. Sean Malone was listed as a gametime decision but did not participate in the pregame skate. Freshman Michael Floodstrand will take his place.
After topping St. Lawrence last night, Harvard—ranked 11th in the PairWise—is an effective lock to make the NCAA tournament regardless of Saturday’s outcome. Donato says that should allow his side to focus more on the task at hand.
“We won’t have that little bit of fear in the back of the mind that if you don’t win, you don’t make the NCAA tournament,” Donato said. “There’s seven teams that are going to raise a trophy from here to the end of the season—six conference winners and the national champion. Our guys are really locked in and focused and want to win this game.”
While Quinnipiac will be seeking its first Whitelaw Cup in ECAC history, the Crimson will be chasing its second consecutive title and its 10th all time.
“We know how important it is and how hard it is to win this tournament,” Criscuolo said. “It’s definitely something we want to do right now and not wait a few more years to get back here. It’s something special and we want to win it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 21, 2016, at 3:35 a.m.
LAKE PLACID, N.Y. — With 10 seconds to go in the first period of Saturday night’s ECAC championship game, Quinnipiac held its breath.
One season after a leg injury kept Bobcat star Sam Anas out of the ECAC men’s hockey semifinals against Harvard, Quinnipiac’s most dangerous weapon was gone once more. Crimson junior Luke Esposito crushed the 5’8” Anas into the boards behind the Bobcat net, bringing another ECAC tournament run for the conference’s leading point-getter to a premature close.
Quinnipiac, on the other hand, was just getting started.
Esposito received a five-minute boarding major for the hit, putting the Bobcats on the man advantage for the first 4:50 of the second period. And despite missing its leading man, the Quinnipiac power play put on a show.
The No. 2/2 Bobcats scored twice on the major and a third time on another 5-on-4 minutes later to put a stranglehold on their first ECAC championship in program history by way of a 4-1 win over No. 9/9 Harvard.
“The guys, they were mad with the hit,” Quinnipiac coach Rand Pecknold said. “It’s part of hockey. For us, it was more about getting focused. Sam was done, and we had to move on.”
“When you get to the [ECAC’s] final four or the NCAA tournament, it’s a one-shot deal,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “You have to be able to manage those momentum swings. You have to be able to stay away from that big mistake. Tonight, we certainly weren’t.”
Second-team all-ECAC honoree Tim Clifton set the Bobcat freight train in motion 1:11 into the second, beating sophomore netminder Merrick Madsen from the right faceoff circle for his 18th score of the year. Sophomore Landon Smith picked up an assist on the play, then scored a goal of his own from nearly the same spot less than two minutes later with Esposito still a helpless spectator.
After Esposito finally left the box, freshman Adam Baughman was quick to take his place. Junior winger K.J. Tiefenwerth made the Crimson (19-10-4, 12-6-4 ECAC) pay for a holding call on the rookie, stuffing home a rebound at 7:20.
“We just can’t be in the box that long with a great team like Quinnipiac,” Harvard co-captain Kyle Criscuolo said. “Madsen’s been really good on the penalty kill for us all year, [but] I don’t think he saw a few.”
Just as the Bobcats (29-3-7, 16-1-5) began to run away with the contest, however, freshman Ryan Donato pulled the Crimson right back into contention. Eight seconds following Quinnipiac’s third and final power play strike, Donato sniped a wrister over senior goaltender Michael Garteig’s left shoulder from the right faceoff circle to make it 3-1.
Ten minutes later, Harvard generated a shorthanded opportunity that could have pulled it within one, as co-captains Jimmy Vesey and Criscuolo broke free on an effective 2-on-0.
Criscuolo made his way up the right wing and fed a pass through the low slot to Vesey, who had more than a step on the nearest Quinnipiac defenseman. But the puck never laid flat.
“I definitely had him,” said Vesey in reference to Garteig. “I think the puck was bouncing the whole way, and Kyle was trying to settle it…. It almost went over the top of my stick, and that’s not where I was trying to go with it.”
The Crimson remained within striking distance in the third, but freshman Scott Davidson put an end to Harvard’s comeback bid with an empty-netter 1:09 prior to the end of regulation. The Crimson finished with just 25 shots, its lowest output since Harvard laid an egg against Northeastern in the Beanpot consolation game (20 shots) on Feb. 8.
Last year’s ECAC tournament champions did generate 10 attempts in the opening period though, as the Crimson controlled play early. Harvard held the Bobcats to just four shots in the first 15 minutes and also drew two penalties. But neither power play produced a score, and the Crimson finished 0-for-4 there on the night.
“When it’s all said and done, whatever way we want to spin it, they executed on special teams; we didn’t,” Ted Donato said.
Harvard was without junior Sean Malone, a mainstay on the penalty-killing unit, who was scratched for precautionary reasons after dealing with cramps Friday night. Donato says he fully expects him to be back by next weekend, when the Crimson opens its NCAA tournament run against No. 5/4 Boston College.
Meanwhile, after being crowned champion of the ECAC, Quinnipiac earned the top overall seed in hockey's edition of the Big Dance. The Bobcats had previously reached the ECAC championship just once (2007) since joining the league in 2005.
Despite the shortage of appearances in the ECAC title game, however, Quinnipiac’s veterans have accumulated no shortage of hardware. The Bobcats’ seniors have rattled off 106 career wins, securing three Cleary Cups as regular season ECAC champions along the way. And now they finally have the Whitelaw to add to the collection.
“Our senior class is out of this world right now,” Quinnipiac senior Soren Jonzzon said. “We’ve had four years of really strong, great teams, and to finally come away with one, it’s unbelievable.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Entering Saturday, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team had not lost to Brown at home since the 2010 season. With the Bears ranked No. 5 in both national polls and boasting an undefeated record after five contests this season, the Crimson knew that it would be a challenge to come out with a win over Brown in Cambridge on Saturday.
The Bears came out firing in the first two quarters and jumped out to an 8-2 lead, but with five minutes remaining in the final period, Harvard found itself within striking distance when senior attackman Devin Dwyer found the back of the net to make it 9-8.
On the very next possession, however, Brown’s attackmen methodically passed the ball around, chewing up the clock before senior attackman Kylor Bellistri found the back of the net to restore a two point lead. The Crimson never drew close again as Bellistri added an insurance goal to round out the last period.
With the 11-8 win, the Bears (6-0, 1-0 Ivy) continue their hot start to the season and are one of only three undefeated teams left in the nation after No. 3/3 Syracuse fell to No. 8/8 Johns Hopkins later in the afternoon. Harvard (4-3, 0-1 Ivy), meanwhile, extended its losing streak to three games.
“The team played its heart out and we just came up short,” Crimson coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “Our defense, especially, it kept us in the game till the end against a very good offense. I’m proud of the effort the guys showed.”
The defense certainly stepped up for Harvard, as the unit, despite playing without senior standout and co-captain Stephen Jahelka, limited the No. 1 scoring offense in the country to it’s lowest output of the season.
Fellow senior defenseman Bobby Duvnjak did play, and spent most of the day guarding Brown junior attackman Dylan Molloy. He worked with the rest of the Crimson defensive unit to hold Molloy, the national leader in points per game with 6.60, to one goal and one assist. Bellistri also only finished with three points, after entering the match ranked fourth in the same category with 5.20 points per game.
“We didn’t do anything differently to try to contain them,” Wojcik said. “But even when they we’re finding their shots, they were creating space for their teammates and making their presence felt.”
The Bear's goals came from different sources than usual as the team raced out to a commanding, 8-3 halftime lead. Six players contributed goals to Brown’s offensive outburst, and a pair of midfielders, senior Matt Graham and sophomore Stephen Hudak, combined for four goals in the first quarter after only recording six between the two in the Bears' first five games.
Dwyer, Harvard’s own offensive keystone, found it difficult to make it on the score sheet. He entered Saturday as the country’s second-leading points getter, but was only able to match Molloy with one point and one assist.
To try to spur his team on, Wojcik made several unexpected changes during the game. He replaced sophomore goalie Robert Shaw, who played every minute of the team’s previous matches, with senior Bryan Moore. Moore performed well, and even held Brown scoreless in the third quarter as the Crimson began to claw back. It was the first period all season in which the Bears failed to find the back of the net.
“Coach tried out some different looks but it didn’t really affect our mindset,” said Harvard senior midfielder and co-captain Sean Mahon. “We just need to make sure whoever is on the field is getting the job done.”
Wocjik also shuffled attackmen Will Walker and Joe Lang, putting the senior, Walker, in a deeper position to help him score two key goals in the second half. None of the changes ultimately pushed the Crimson over the edge, however.
“We were outplayed today and that’s all it really comes down to,” Mahon said. “We started out too slow and that cost us a chance to earn a big win.”
