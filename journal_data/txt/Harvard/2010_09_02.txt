After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Commencement morning dawns. In Cambridge and its environs, expectancy and relief, wistfulness and joy tug on many hearts. The myriad threads of 7,000 Harvardians’ experiences are about to be woven into a grand tapestry of celebration and praise, of conclusion and sendoff.
As black robes emerge from closets and champagne glasses are drained in house dining halls, final preparations are taking place in Harvard Yard. For some, like the commencement director, Grace Scheibner ’90, these are the culminating moments of the past 12 months’ work. Most of the parents lining up at the gates, most of the students converging on the Yard, will never know her, but Grace has spent the past year corresponding, coordinating, and cross-checking so that everything will run smoothly and pleasantly today.
As Grace shepherds honorands to their seats on the stage, we three orators snatch our last pre-performance moments at the microphone and retreat to Boylston Hall with our coaches, Richard J. Tarrant and Rebekah Maggor, to await the procession into the Yard. For us, too, this day has been long in the making. Months ago, the first glimmerings of an oration idea appeared on the horizon. The ensuing intensity of composition, revision, submission, and multiple deliveries before the judges ended in a congratulatory e-mail; little did we know what a journey was about to begin.
Our first meeting took place in the Bok Center on the third floor of the Science Center. For Chiamaka, a veteran of Rebekah’s public speaking class, it was familiar ground, and she excitedly anticipated the new techniques she would learn. Jimmy and Mary Anne feigned composure as Rebekah proposed beginning with jumping jacks and several thoroughly embarrassing vocal exercises. Jimmy later declared that, in all his career as a professional stand-up comic he had never before prepared for a gig with calisthenics and a verbal shot-put, attempting to “throw his voice” out the window, across the Yard, and into a steeple window with a decrescendo of “La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, laaaaaa!”
As the weeks passed, we three musketeers and our two mentors formed a strong bond. When impromptu practice sessions found their way into our evenings, Rebekah’s little daughter Raya joined us; sometimes bashful, sometimes gregarious, she was always a most welcome audience member. Together, we applauded each orator’s moment of unmooring from the printed text and cheered to see the speeches’ gestures and inflections take shape. Professor Tarrant and Rebekah attentively watched delivery after delivery, providing observations and advice on the spot and by e-mail between practices.
Self-consciousness had to be brushed aside as we prepared to entertain and enlighten an audience of 30,000. Mary Anne rehearsed anywhere and everywhere she could, several times co-opting groups of unsuspecting friends into listening. On a brief trip to Florida, she commandeered an empty glassed-in waiting area in the airport as a practice room and returned smiles for the inquiring glances of passersby. On her third run-through, however, she almost ground to a halt mid-gesticulation as she heard the announcement, “If you see any suspicious package or activity, do not keep it to yourself...”
Jimmy returned to his roots, practicing at the Comedy Studio above the Hong Kong Restaurant, in the Passim Folk Club in Harvard Square, and at 1:30 a.m. in the morning as the last act of the open mic night at the Cantab Lounge in Central Square. With several patrons in the late stages of intoxication and one heckling from the bar, Jimmy implored the five remaining conscious people to “pretend that we are all graduating from Harvard this coming Thursday and that I am one of the commencement speakers.” He then launched into, “I’m truly honored to be here,” and, remembering the instructions of his two mentors, proceeded to “throw his voice” over the heads of the inebriates, past the slurring heckler, and beyond the band members-turned-Harvard graduates to the back wall of Bud Light mirrors and restrooms. As his voice echoed through the bar room, he felt instinctively for the first time that the speech was finally ready: those intoxicated appeared to be contemplating sobriety, the heckler had been stilled, and the band had turned their thoughts to academia.
All this to say: when you watch the orators ascend the steps to the microphone on commencement day, know that behind each word and each gesture are a multitude of stories and a plenitude of generous people whose efforts have made the occasion possible. As we descended the steps, mission accomplished, the gratitude swelling our hearts found expression in the hymn that followed, set to the stirring music of Gustav T. Holst: “For this place and for these people, we give you thanks, O God.”
Jimmy Tingle MPA ‘10, Chiamaka Nwakeze ’10, and Mary Anne Marks ’10 were all orators at the 2010 Commencement ceremony.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: 
 
CORRECTION: SEPTEMBER 16, 2010
Due to an editing error, an earlier version of the Sept. 2 article “Commencement Orators Look Back” incorrectly listed Grace Scheibner as a member of the Class of 1969. In fact, she is a member of the Class of 1990. The Crimson regrets the error.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the economy continues to face falling prices and high unemployment, the Federal Reserve is failing to fulfill its mandate to pursue the goals of price stability and maximum employment. It is currently doing far too little to strengthen the economy, and its inaction is both inexplicable and unacceptable. Ben Bernanke has signaled that he will pursue further actions if the economy worsens, but the time to act is now: The economy is already in horrible shape for the average American and has been for quite some time. Through a program of inflation targeting and quantitative easing, the Federal Reserve can avoid deflation and increase aggregate demand, both of which will lead to stable prices and higher employment.
After haltingly climbing out of the Great Recession with the help of the stimulus bill, the American economy stands at a precipice. Unemployment remains staggeringly high at 9.5 percent, and just as discouraging as the dearth of jobs are slowing manufacturing growth and horribly weak home sales. Inflation rates have fallen well below the stated target of two percent. The recession has not ended for many Americans, and the economy stands the risk of worsening again if Congress or the Federal Reserve fails to act immediately to bolster aggregate demand. Congress has shown itself incapable of taking meaningful action due to the nihilistic filibustering of Senate Republicans, and thus the Federal Reserve is left with the responsibility of getting our recovery on track.
Luckily, the Federal Reserve is more than capable of doing so. Joseph E. Gagnon ’81, a former Federal Reserve staffer who is now at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, has argued that creating a program of asset purchases to lower interest rates on bank reserves and Treasury notes as well as establishing a low-interest borrowing facility for banks, would, “according to the Federal Reserve's own economic model…reduce unemployment roughly as much as a two-year, $500 billion fiscal package.” Such a plan is called “quantitative easing,” and it would work because the Federal Reserve would be pumping more money into the economy, making it easier for businesses to borrow. In addition to these actions, the Federal Reserve should establish a higher inflation target, at three or four percent, meaningfully impacting business plans by signifying that the Federal Reserve will continue monetary expansion until inflation reaches its target.
It is not easy to understand the technical aspects behind monetary policy. But the main thing to understand is that right now, not enough spending is taking place in the economy. Businesses are not taking risks to expand, and consumers are not spending. By pumping large amounts of money into the economy through quantitative easing and telling businesses that this will be the case for the foreseeable future through inflation targeting, the Federal Reserve can create strong incentives for businesses to borrow and expand economic activity.
Opponents of such a plan have argued that much of today’s unemployment is structural, and thus Federal Reserve actions can’t do much to increase employment. This common argument claims that the economy has changed, there will be less jobs in certain industries such as manufacturing and construction in the future, and it is impossible to immediately train workers for the new industries to which demand will shift.
Such an argument is intellectually appealing, but fortunately, there’s no proof to back up such a claim. J. Bradford DeLong ’82, the former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under President William J. Clinton, recently showed that, with the exception of logging, internet, and healthcare, employment has declined significantly over 18 major industries during the recession. DeLong points out that if most of the problem was a “structural mismatch,” then there would be huge declines in the “old” employment areas and booms in the “new” employment areas. But the widespread problem shows that, instead, the employment issue is due to an economy-wide lack of demand, which the Federal Reserve has ample tools to fight. However, if the Fed continues to wait on aggressive action, people who could go back to work right now will lose their skills, and our cyclical employment problem could become a far more intractable structural issue.
Other economists, such as Thomas M. Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, are, puzzlingly, still anxious about the risks of high inflation, despite the fact that prices have fallen. We are far, far away from rapid inflation that would put savings and the economy at risk, and if expansionary monetary policy does eventually cause rapid inflation, something that definitely isn’t happening right now, the Federal Reserve can reverse course at a moment’s notice.
Finally, many are worried that more aggressive monetary policy might not work. After all, such unconventional monetary policy has rarely been attempted before. But, as Paul R. Krugman has recently noted, no less an authority than Ben S. Bernanke ’75, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has called out the Bank of Japan for their lack of action during Japan’s lost decade. Bernanke said that “Most striking is the apparent unwillingness of the monetary authorities to experiment, to try anything that isn’t absolutely guaranteed to work.” Now is the time for Bernanke to experiment, be aggressive, and act to get the economy going again. The futures of millions of Americans, people who are struggling to find a job, stay in their homes, or pay for educations, lie in their hands.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although the amount of courses available this fall may seem overwhelming, one professor’s offerings are notably missing. After Psychology Professor Marc D. Hauser’s research was investigated under the direction of Dean of the Faculty of the Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith, he was found “solely responsible” for eight different counts of scientific misconduct and is currently taking a year of leave from teaching at the University. While this sanction may appear to be a sore in Harvard’s side, the process that led to this decision reinforces the high standards to which we are glad professors are held.
Hauser’s story is surprising, given his sizable body of research and influence on the field of evolutionary psychology. Yet the action taken against Hauser by Harvard illustrates that no one’s work is immune to scrutiny or probing. Although misconduct in any academic discipline is obviously cause for great concern, the widespread publicity that this story has generated will ideally make it clear to researchers of all levels that the scientific community and its institutions will not stand for it. Additionally, as much as this investigation will serve as a reminder for researchers to act honestly, it also gives students proof that academic honesty is a standard applicable to everyone.
Although popular science is often accessible to the general population because it presents its findings without rundowns of complicated methods, a lack of transparency has complicated this entire situation. Not only was the alleged misconduct in the experiments behind the rescinded journal articles veiled from the peer reviewers, but Harvard’s reporting of its own investigation has lacked specifics as well. Rather than imitate the very problem it is trying to quell, Harvard should make public the findings of its internal investigation and clarify for what types of scientific misconduct Hauser was “solely responsible.”
In the wake of an incident such as this, institutional review boards—the bodies that determine whether study proposals are ethically and scientifically sound before they are allowed to proceed—should heighten their approach to checking methods that are controversial or extremely subtle. Professors at research universities are under constant pressure to publish their findings. If negative results are accepted as normal parts of the research process rather than symbols of failure and shame, perhaps researchers such as Hauser will feel less pressure to alter their results to be “right.”
Some of the few people who have been forthright during this process are former students who worked in Hauser’s lab. They presented evidence of correspondences with Hauser that showed his frustration with the students’ desire to check data again before coming to a conclusion. The courage to stand up to a tenured Harvard professor is admirable and a salient example of the rightful prioritization of accuracy over fame. As such, we laud the students who questioned the pressure they were receiving from Hauser.
Professor Hauser has been an innovator in his field and a popular lecturer while at Harvard, but if Dean Smith provides strong evidence that he intentionally fabricated scientific data, Hauser should be removed from the Faculty. Like the boy who cried wolf, there will be little reason to believe anything else he says in the future. Still, even if Hauser is not in the classroom anymore, there are lessons to be learned from his trials.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To my freshman self, four years felt like forever. College was an endlessly accelerating expanse of novelty—and I was a glutton for the new. New campus, new classes, new modes of awkward social interaction—the newness continued ad infinitum, a sugar-high without the attendant crash. College seemed less like a transitional phase, poised between teenage angst and adult awareness, and more like a permanent state of being. Thesis, graduation, the “real world”—these markers of finality existed only in a nebulous and asymptotic future. As new became my new old, the Harvard bubble assumed its own self-contained logic. Everything conspired to conceal the all-too-obvious reality: One day, this bubble would burst.
On some level, I had always known that the end would come. Diplomas would be awarded, caps would be thrown, and Cambridge would become fodder for photo albums and anecdotes. Still, graduation read like a grand cultural cliché: something that I had seen enacted in sitcoms but that would never quite happen to me.
Admittedly, my moment of realization was itself cliché—the case, it seems, with all youthful epiphanies. Perhaps it was the mosh of other twenty-somethings, the smell of grass muddied by spilled beer, or the combined haze of cigarette smoke and late-summer sun. Yet, projected from a Chicago soundstage, MGMT’s “Time to Pretend”—a fully ironic lament—struck me as intensely sincere. Graduation spelled the end of limitless choice and self-indulgent exploration. Pragmatic decision-making would have to supplant aimless fantasizing. I would have to finally decide what I was “doing with my life,” enter into “adulthood” (whatever that meant), and concern myself with real person things, like taxes and co-op boards. And, even if it did all work out, wouldn’t I just end up missing my mom?
All Harvard students grapple with these questions at some point during their undergraduate tenure. Christine Hassler, author and former twenty-year-old, calls it the “twenties triangle”: three nagging prompts—“Who am I? What do I want? How do I get it?”—that twenty-somethings universally confront. Psychologist Jeffrey J. Arnett, profiled in Robin M. Henig’s recent New York Times Magazine cover story, calls it “emerging adulthood”: a distinct developmental stage where everything seems vaguely possible, but nothing feels for certain. In 2005, Time Magazine coined a neologism of its own—“twixters”—to describe this post-college cohort, stuck in sociological limbo between adolescence and adulthood.
Such buzzwords, all striving to capture the twenty-something zeitgeist, abound. They span a continuum of absurdity, from the nondescript “youth” to the unfortunate portmanteau “adultescent.” Pair this with the semantic confusion over what to call kids these days—Millennials, Generation Y, Echo Boomers—and a headache ensues. Nobody seems to get what is going on or how the terminological noise might help to clarify it. 
Commentators seem only able to agree that a change is occurring. As Henig’s article details, the “timetable for adulthood” is shifting; traditional “milestones” of career, family, and mortgage refuse to arrive as quickly as they once did. Henig offers several explanations: the Great Recession, more progressive cultural norms, and that eternal scapegoat, hyper-involved parents. Each falls short of a full accounting, and Henig ends at a moral impasse: Is this moratorium on “growing up” to be embraced or shunned?
Parsing this question has become a perennial media obsession. Adults appear forever concerned that today’s youth won’t live up to their expectations—or, at least, won’t work long enough to foot their Social Security bill. But while quarter-life crises may be relatively novel, existential dread has always been in vogue. The self-help section, the therapist’s couch, the cultural resonance of mid-life turmoil; each attests to the fact that, at some point, everyone’s lives—not just those of rising Harvard seniors—deserve some critical distance. Julia Roberts’ turn in “Eat, Pray, Love” confirmed my suspicions that searching self-doubt can happen to anyone. You’re never too old, too committed, or too scheduled to take a book advance, befriend a spiritual guru, and run away with Javier Bardem.
Considered in context, then, my revelation came softly. The song ended, and the next began, my wanderlust neither aroused nor dimmed. Seventy-odd years of unstructured time still stretched before me, waiting to be filled with milestones achieved and creative energies sated. This reality was terrifying, but wonderfully so. Deciding “what to do with my life” would not be the result of one gratuitous choice but a net accumulation of numerous resolves, each with its own opportunity for crisis and change.
Me, “grow up”? Not yet.

After juggling his business of selling rare books for more than 25 years, John W. Wronoski will be closing the doors to his bookstore in Harvard Square on September 25.
Faced with an operation that was “hemorrhaging” money, the owner of Lame Duck Books on 12 Arrow Street first announced his closing sale in late July.
Wronoski blamed his virtual competitors in the online bookselling markets for “destroying” the trade of purchasing rare books in person.
“Nowadays people like myself who’ve devoted...50 years to this world have no means of competing again,” he said.
Wronoski first opened Lame Duck Books in Philadelphia in 1984, before moving to Harvard Square. The store is known for its used and rare books, manuscripts, photographs, and artwork priced in the upper thousands.
“It was a way of earning an income without actually doing something that I considered odious, like work,” he said. “Not that you don’t work an enormous amount in this, but it’s completely pleasure.”
But Wronoski was careful not to label himself a bibliophile because he rejects a personal relationship with books.
“I maintain custody of these fabulous objects until the right person comes along to relieve me of them,” he said.
The first rare books Wronoski acquired were purchased from his colleagues. He thought the books were under-appreciated, and that he could buy and sell them to people who would value them more.
Wronoski said that his collection for the store grew slowly with books he described as “very important,” even selling the first editions of “culturally momentous” books.
One such example was Wronoski’s favorite book in the store: a copy of the first English edition of T.S. Eliot’s “The Wasteland.” The edition was printed by Virginia Woolf and contained an inscription from Eliot to Paul Valéry, one of Eliot’s chief literary antecedents, according to Wronoski.
After pursuing this particular copy for over a decade, Wronoski purchased the book for $115,000. His price for Lame Duck customers: $350,000.
“For me, money is so much less interesting than these objects,” Wronoski said. “I’m selling the best thing that you could possibly buy.”

Cooperation between two different species may be driven by individual interests rather than fear of punishment, according to Harvard researchers.
The findings, to be published next week in the U.S. journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, discount the idea that mutually beneficial relationships result from the promise of rewards or the threat of retaliation.
E. Glen Weyl, a Harvard post-doctoral economics fellow who led the study, examined the relationship between plants and ants in Peru to test the Host Sanction Theory that the host species—or plant, in this case—had evolved to punish, or reward the ants.
But when Weyl teamed up with two biologists from Harvard and the University of Toronto to analyze real-world data, the results were inconsistent with the model’s predictions.
“Plants didn’t evolve to give an incentive, but the ants naturally had an incentive to protect the plant—that is, if the plant died, they wouldn’t have anywhere to live,” Weyl said.
Most symbiotic relationships form between species such as plants and smaller insects or bacteria.
The study’s findings, researchers said, resulted from the application of economic theory to inter-special social interaction—two fields that Harvard biology professor Naomi E. Pierce said traditionally work independently of each other.
“While economists have very sophisticated models of human thinking, biologists look at fitness,” Pierce said. “Both have similar models...but both look at different perspectives.”
Weyl and Megan Frederickson, an ecology and evolutionary biology assistant professor at the University of Toronto, traveled to Peru last year to collect data for the study.
The team also used existing data documenting mutualism behavior between a legume and a soil bacterium, and between a yucca and a moth, Weyl said.
A theoretical economist, Weyl said his research in Peru contrasted sharply with his time writing math across white boards.
“I not only literally got his hands dirty by the data, but also got bitten by the data,” he said.

Female faculty members in the sciences are nearly half as likely as their male counterparts to receive paid advisory positions in the private sector, according to a Harvard Business School study drafted this summer.
Positions on science advisory boards can provide substantial boosts to academics’ incomes, typically in payments amounting to around 5 percent of company shares. But after spending years collecting data on more than 500 biotech firms, the researchers confirmed a major discrepancy in whom is appointed to such positions.
The report, titled “From Bench to Board: Gender Differences in University Scientists’ Participation in Commercial Science,” builds off of a collection of recent literature that has brought to light the gender imbalances across academia.
At Harvard University, where only a quarter of the faculty are women, the administration has spearheaded a series of projects to increase female representation in the faculty since it established the Office of Faculty Development & Diversity in 2005.
But the authors, including Business School Professor Toby E. Stuart, set out to investigate whether the gender discrepancies across academia carry over to the commercial lives of faculty members. Seeking to explain the employment gap, the authors pointed to a lack of women currently in the private sector, which they believe leads to a male-dominated commercial environment.
“It’s important for companies to realize the problem and find ways to increase the representation of women in the senior ranks,” said co-author Waverly W. Ding, of University of California, Berkeley.
The researchers were most surprised to find the gap largest in elite institutions. At schools such as MIT, women were even less likely to serve on advisory boards relative to their male counterparts.
“Our explanation is that there is a kind of conservative trend among women at top universities,” Ding said.
“A commercial affiliation might not be seen as criteria for strong performance for women at elite universities,” she added.

Suzanne E. Duke resigned from her position as Crimson Yard resident dean of freshmen due to medical reasons last Tuesday, only two days before freshman move-in day.
Former Assistant Dean of Residential life Catherine R. Shapiro has taken over the position for the year.
Throughout Opening Days, Duke’s duties were divided among the staff of the Freshman Dean’s Office. The proctor trainings and information packets for freshmen referenced Duke, so the shift “required adjustments,” said Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67.
Yesterday, Duke’s responsibilities were still dispersed among FDO staff, as Shapiro was busy working on administrative tasks.
Shapiro, who served as the chief of staff for the president of Bryn Mawr College—Jane McAuliffe—last year, began moving to Cambridge from her home near Bryn Mawr in Philadelphia last Saturday.
She began work on Monday and said she is still transitioning into her new role.
“It is a little confusing to have a new resident dean right now, but students shouldn’t feel unsupported,” Shapiro said.
Proctors and freshmen living in Crimson Yard­—which includes Greenough, Hurlbut, Pennypacker, and Wigglesworth dorms­—were notified of the change via e-mail.
Freshmen living in Crimson Yard said that so far they have mostly interacted with their proctors and their Peer Advising Fellows, so they did not notice the absence of their resident dean in the past week.
The night Duke resigned, the senior staff at the Freshman Dean’s Office immediately met and decided to reach out to Shapiro, Dingman said.
As there was no time to conduct a full search, Shapiro’s position is still on an interim basis.
After consulting with the senior staff of Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, the FDO extended an offer to Shapiro.
“I knew that she was somebody with a big heart and a strong analytical bent, and we were delighted when we learned that she was available and interested,” Dingman said of Shapiro.
Shapiro also has extensive experience working at Harvard. Before her year at Bryn Mawr, Shapiro was the assistant dean of residential life, a position she held after having served as the Leverett House resident dean.
“Last year, I had very limited opportunities to talk to students, so I’m thrilled to be back meeting as many people as I can,” she said.
Shapiro added that her 10-year-old son is also happy to be back at Harvard, as he grew up in Leverett.
Both Dingman and Shapiro described Duke as beloved by her proctors and her colleagues at the FDO.
“We were saddened by the sudden change in plans of Dean Duke,” Dingman said. “Students and proctors respected her and found her enthusiastically available and thoughtful,” he added.

An empty space in the window of Cardullo’s Gourmet Shoppe has left an even larger void in the hearts of members of the Chair Club, a stalwart group that regularly convened before the storefront to watch Boston Red Sox games.
After the team lost two out of three games to the Tampa Bay Rays—making it unlikely that they would secure a title this season—the store’s part-owners Donez J. Cardullo-Tavilla and Francesca Cardullo decided to remove the television, finalizing the change on Monday.
Cardullo-Tavilla said that considerations of how the street-side programming figured into Cardullo’s mission as a gourmet food store had prompted the move. She recalled the words of an interior decorator they had hired: “Is this a sports store or a high-end gourmet food store?”
“It doesn’t fit in with our plan to revitalize the store as a serious food player,” Cardullo-Tavilla said of the television.
She plans to redesign the window display by imitating her grandmother’s own setups in the Brattle Street store decades ago: luxury food items showcased in the style of old European shopfront windows.
The change has upended the tradition of the dozen or so members of the “Chair Club”—a group that started out informally, but has since grown to a loyal contingent that watches games on chairs outside of Cardullo’s.
Members gathered in front of the store yesterday night to protest, listening to a Red Sox game on the radio.
“I feel beside myself and that’s putting it lightly,” said Kelly Dugas Coveney, who has been a member of the Chair Club since 2006. Her history with the club runs deep: she met her husband—Dennis Coveney, the self-professed CEO and founder of the club—at one of its meetings in 2006. The couple was married in front of the television screen on April 6, 2009, the opening day for the Red Sox.
“I feel as bad as losing a family member or a family pet,” Dugas Coveney said of the removal of the television.
The Chair Club was occasionally joined by celebrities such as Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner, according to Coveney. The host of National Public Radio’s show “Car Talk,” Tom Magliozzi, said he used to frequently watch the games at Cardullo’s when he was in Harvard Square.
“I’m heartbroken,” he said.
Chair Club members said they cherished the way in which Cardullo’s screening of Red Sox games brought people together.
“It gathers all economic groups together, from Harvard professors to homeless people on the street,” said Robert Marshall, a member of the club since its creation in 2003.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association said that while she respects Cardullo’s decision, she was “sad to see [the Chair Club’s] demise” and is working with the club to find another location.
“It won’t be the same,” Jillson said. “It was founded in front of Cardullo’s, it has become a summer pastime for the past seven years, and it is part of the vibrancy and energy of upper Brattle.”
Her decision may have disappointed members of the Chair Club, but Cardullo-Tavilla said she wants the store to remain involved in the community by buying products locally and participating in a Cambridge Police Department charity auction.

Cambridge crime is at a 40-year low, according to the Cambridge Police Department, which released a report last month as part of a new initiative launched this summer to increase transparency.
Total crime reports dropped 10 percent in 2009 with 3,566 crimes, and fell another 7 percent since the beginning of the year.
But larceny from persons and bicycle thefts have increased 17 percent and 54 percent respectively, with a notable increase in Harvard Square.
“Theft in Harvard Square is a seasonal issue related to the type of people that frequent the square,” CPD Lieutenant Daniel Wagner wrote in an e-mail.
Wagner said large groups of tourists and incoming students, who frequent the Square starting late summer, are prime targets for larceny because they tend to be less aware of their surroundings.
The overall decrease in crime is part of a national trend, and Wagner emphasized the Cambridge Police have “taken proactive steps to make our city a safer place to live and visit.”
The BridgeStat program launched this summer requires that police meet twice a month to devise strategies and tactics to reduce crime, such as deploying extra bike patrols to areas that are more susceptible to crime.
Wagner wrote he believes that BridgeStat resulted in an immediate decrease in crime in Harvard Square since its implementation.
“After implementing directed strategies devised during BridgeStat meetings at the beginning of the summer, we are proud to announce that only three unrelated incidents have been reported in Harvard Square since the end of July,” Wagner wrote.
The report also stated that violent crime in Cambridge has dropped 58 percent since its peak in 1990, with only 449 incidents reported in 2009, the second lowest number in four decades.
Incidents of property crime are the lowest they have been in forty years, dropping 68 percent since their height in 1974, with 3,121 incidents reported in 2009.
These trends in lowered crime rates continued through the first half of 2010, with a 17 percent decrease of violent crime and a 6 percent decrease in property crime since January.
No murders have occurred in the past 14 months, and robberies have decreased by 38 percent.
Reported incidents of rape have increased by 12 percent with 16 reports in the first half of 2010, all of which were acquaintance rapes.
The Cambridge Police Department will release its second BridgeStat report with updated numbers this week, according to Wagner.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Many Cambridge residents had hoped that the induction of a new School Committee and new mayor would initiate active measures against issues currently facing the Cambridge School District: the deepening budget deficit, the perennial student achievement gap, and organizational difficulties.
But progress in many of these areas has remained sluggish. The Crimson reviews the Committee’s past year, as well as the issues that will be brought yet again to the Committee’s table this fall.
MIXED REVIEWS
Nine months after the election of the new School Committee, members remain uncertain about how best to balance budget shortfalls with the need for greater professional teacher training, modified curricula to accommodate all levels of students, and increased focus on the middle grades—a heated topic on its own. But committee members, as well as Schools Superintendent Jeffrey M. Young, contend that tangible progress has been made.
According to Young, a focus on professional development in the past fiscal year has helped “increase [educators’] capacities to deliver a structural method to help all students, regardless where they are in the academic spectrum.”
“A lot of work that has been done, and the benefit of it you can see now,” Cambridge Mayor and School Committee chair David P. Maher says, pointing out that of the 22 high school seniors in the Cambridge school district accepted to Harvard this year, 16 attended Cambridge public schools. “This puts Cambridge in the top five communities in the world.”
A WIDENING GAP
Maher’s statistics may be promising, but the Cambridge district schools continue to grapple with gaping disparities in test scores between White and Asian students, and other minority groups. In last year’s Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System testing, poor overall scores placed the district in the “needs improvement” category for the first time ever, due to the low average test scores of Black, Hispanic, low-income, and special education students.
The gap has been attributed to uneven instruction throughout the schools and the lack of focus on the middle grades, as exemplified in Cambridge’s current lack of stand-alone middle schools.
The long-standing problem arose as a prominent issue during last November’s elections for members of the School Committee, as candidates loudly criticized the achievement gap plaguing the district and called it “unacceptable.”
In an effort to bridge the gap, current Committee members set aside a budget that would promote curriculum continuity in the jump from elementary to high school. In addition, the Committee has pushed training within the Cambridge Leadership Network, a group of leaders in the education community who focus on the improvement of classroom environment, teaching techniques, and feedback for teachers.
“We need to continue to focus on the middle grades and other issues including our curriculum construction and professional development of teachers,” School Committee member Nancy Tauber says.
THE PROBLEM MIDDLE
To help tackle the achievement gap, Young formally proposed the establishment of a middle school to supplement the city’s K-8-only system at a School Committee meeting in February.
“Not every child is getting exactly what they need,” Young said at the meeting, calling the achievement gap “immoral.”
Young originally committed to presenting concrete proposals regarding the issues pervading the Cambridge middle grades by October 2009, but the recommendations were delayed multiple times and finally slated to appear this month.
“We began the year with an intent to look at restructuring possibilities for our middle grades,” Young says. “The further along we went, we found that it was a layered problem that required further study.”
Of the five options Young forwarded at the February Committee meeting, he pushed for the “hybrid” model, which involves a combination of some K-5 and K-8 schools and the establishment of a grades 6-8 middle school. Committee members expect to flesh out the model this month.
In spite of the oft-discouraging delays in implementation, Tauber assures that the Committee has been discussing “the structure for a very long time” and that “the teachers and administrators are working on it every day.”
CONTROLLING CHOICES
The proposal to create a separate Cambridge middle school has divided district leaders for decades. The current school system, which includes 11 K-8 schools, has been accused of supporting the racially and socio-economically isolating environments to which the achievement gap has been attributed.
Controlled choice was initially set in place to create a racially-balanced student population across schools. The program allows parents to submit a ranked list of preferred schools but ultimately uses an algorithm to place students according to set demographic ratios.
Several School Committee members have pointed out that controlled choice has largely failed to achieve its goal, as it eventually assigns students based on their neighborhoods of residence and thus results in racial and socio-economic imbalance.
“We have a lot of middle school grades that are not as diverse as they should be, and that should be addressed,” says Alfred B. Fantini, the longest-serving member of the Committee.
In the past year, little has changed in the controlled choice system. Parag A. Pathak ’02, an assistant economics professor at MIT, recommended a new algorithm for the student-to-school assigning process, but concrete discussion were mostly tabled.
“We’ve talked about pieces of it,” Tauber says. “It’s complicated because at the end of the day it talks about race and class.”
“I think that we really need to take a comprehensive look at it...I don’t think we’ve done that since I’ve been on the school committee,” Tauber adds.
The current schools assignment system will not see drastic changes anytime soon, Maher says: “I don’t think that you’re going to see the system thrown out. You’re going to see some fine tuning.”
GOVERNING MONEY
The Cambridge public school system faces a $3.7 million deficit going into the 2011 fiscal year, and city schools consequently suffered deep staff cuts in the central administration.
“This budget was crafted in a time of fiscal constraint,” Young said back in April when the school committee recommended reorganization of the city school system’s central administration, eliminating administrative support jobs and cutting teaching aides in the elementary grades.
Young said he hoped these cutbacks would have a streamlining effect, creating positions that require higher skill levels and greater efficiency. Young also said he hoped budget tightening would shed light on the larger-than-average spending of Cambridge per student. (Cambridge spends approximately $25,000 per student per year, about $10,000 more than Boston or Newton.)
The School Committee’s budget decisions have relied largely on widening the pool of early retirement candidates, in hopes of reducing the number of actual staff cuts.
“That was a very difficult but prudent decision to not have to deal with budget constraints,” says Committee member Marc McGovern. “[But] it’s never easy when you’re talking about peoples’ livelihoods.”
“There are a lot of folks that are in unions and there is a certain process you have to go through before downsizing,” Fantini adds.
Members of the School Committee have tried to look on the bright side, but according to Tauber, “when it comes to talk about the budget [next fiscal year], it’s going to be tough again.”
Additionally, some uncertainty within the School Committee itself—such as this year’s prolonged mayoral election—has added to the Committee’s troubles. Some Committee members also take issue with the superintendent selection process and the two-year term Committee members serve, complaining about the too-rapid turnover within the governance.
“Members who voted for the Superintendent, they are no longer on the school committee,” Fantini says. “He [now] doesn’t have the majority of the School Committee that can say they voted for him.”
“We had to get everyone up to speed; after two years, there are three new members,” Fantini adds.
“It wouldn’t be out of line to look at what makes us a more effective body as opposed to the most political,” McGovern says.
It took the Cambridge City Council seven tries to elect a mayor, and for those two months the School Committee operated with a missing member and without its chair.
But Maher expresses faith in at least the existing mayor-Committee relationship.
“The system that we have has been in place for over 70 years,” he says. “When you’re living through it, it probably seems longer than it is.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Never fear, Around the Water Cooler is back just in time for the start of class. If the thought of returning to problem sets and course packets doesn’t excite you, then maybe the return of Ivy League athletics will. It’s been three months since the Dartmouth baseball team bowed out of the NCAA tournament, marking the last time an Ancient Eight team competed in NCAA competition. The drought will end this weekend when teams from all eight members of the Ivy League suit up for the first time. With that in mind, let’s catch up on the latest news from around the conference.
The Princeton field hockey team, which kicks off its season this Sunday at home against Bucknell, is the highest ranked of any Ivy League team heading into the fall season. After reaching the NCAA semifinals last year, The Tigers received the No. 4 national ranking in the Kookaburra/NFHCA Division One Preseason Poll released last week. The Crimson will play the role of underdog on Oct. 23 when Harvard visits Princeton. The Crimson would prefer to forget about its last contest against the Tigers, a 9-0 loss last October.
The only other representative from the Ivy League making it into the Top 25 for this fall is the No. 10 Harvard men’s soccer team. The winner of this week’s unofficial award for most anticipated Ivy League matchup is the Crimson’s first contest of the season, as Harvard will battle No. 13 Stanford—and potentially Hurricane Earl—on Saturday night at Ohiri Field.
In basketball news, even more Ivy League grads are extending their basketball careers. Judson Wallace, a 2005 graduate of Princeton, signed with C.B. Gran Canaria of Spain’s top basketball league in late August. Wallace’s team is located in the Canary Islands, which should make for a slightly better environment than if Wallace were still living in New Jersey.  Former Cornell sharpshooter Ryan Wittman has signed on with the Italian club Fulgor Libertas Forli, while former Harvard co-captain Doug Miller is also reportedly looking to play overseas.
Over at Columbia, fans of squash received some exciting news, as the Lions’ men’s and women’s squash teams were promoted to the varsity level. While the two teams will compete as varsity squads when play starts this November, they will not be a part of the Ivy Round Robin this season. Last season, Columbia was the lone Ivy League school without a varsity squash program.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Each Thursday, The Crimson will compile a series of unique statistics about Harvard's sports scene. Welcome to the Magic of Numbers—without the problem sets. We'll do the math for you.
NO FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS
 
70 — Percent chance of rain at 7 pm tomorrow, thanks to Hurricane Earl.
1:00 — New time for the Crimson women’s soccer season opener against Long  Island.
BREAKING THE STREAK
 
5 — The number of times Stanford has beaten the men’s soccer team. Harvard has never defeated the Cardinal.
0 — Wins No. 13 Stanford has this year, after being upset in overtime by Vermont, 2-1, yesterday.
150 — The number of free t-shirts that will be given out to students who attend the Crimson-Cardinal matchup on Saturday night.
SISTER ACT
 
2 — Number of McGillivray sisters on the Harvard field hockey team. Georgia, a junior back, has started all 34 games in her Crimson career, while younger sister Bridget, a freshman, is also a back who played for Canada’s U-17 team at the Pan American Cup this year.
2 — Number of games Harvard field hockey will play at home this weekend. The Crimson faces Holy Cross on Saturday and Bryant on Monday.
LEADING THE CHARGE
 
6 — Number of preseason honors accumulated by football captain and safety Collin Zych. He’s been named to three preseason All-America teams and received three preseason Ivy Defensive Player of the Year nods.
12 — Number of pass breakups Zych recorded last season, tops in the Ivy League. He also led the conference in passes defended (14) and ranked third in solo tackles (53).

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Men’s basketball prospect Andre Hollins has confirmed that Harvard is one of his final five schools, as was predicted by The Crimson in late July.
After making a trip to Auburn this weekend, the White Station High School (Memphis, Tenn.) senior will travel to Cambridge for an official visit the weekend of Sept. 17-19 (the same weekend of the Crimson football team’s home opener against Holy Cross).
Next month the 6’2.5”, 195-pound guard will be visiting the campuses of his other three choices: Ole Miss, Minnesota, and Stanford. Hollins said all five schools are even at this point.
One of the Crimson’s top recruiting targets, Hollins is rated as a three-star prospect and No. 30 at his position by Scout.com and No. 126 in the nation by Rivals.
He said that his “first and foremost” priority in picking a school is academics—a statement reflected by his transcript. Hollins carries a 4.5 weighted (3.5 unweighted) GPA and has scored a 25 on the ACT, which he will retake in order to obtain a writing score.
Hollins had nothing but positive things to say about the Crimson.
“Academics [at Harvard] is one of the best in the world—I know I can’t go wrong there,” Hollins said. “Athletically, they’re doing some good things.”
He cited recent graduate Jeremy Lin ’10’s professional success as part of the draw of Harvard.
“That’s a big incentive coming from Harvard, because it shows they’re coming along athletically also,” Hollins said.
Hollins said he plans on making a decision in early November, after his visits and before his high school season begins.

Sometimes, it can seem so hard for students at Harvard to find relationships. We certainly love to   complain  about it.  But now, a new website is here to help…some of us.
 
 DateHarvardSQ calls itself "a unique online dating platform matching discerning women with  Harvard University educated men determined to make a difference in the  world as foremost doctors, lawyers, businessmen, academics and  professionals.” Translation: DateHarvardSQ is a site for (probably non-Harvard) girls who dig  Harvard guys.
 
Interested? Disgusted? Read on to have your most pressing questions answered.
 
First,  a note: since  we talked to the people at DateHarvardSQ, they’ve deleted the links to all the couple  profiles we describe below and two of the featured mens’ profiles  (including Arya,  the 40-year-old bro with the popped collar). Wonder what other  improvements they’ll be making to the site in the next 24 hours?
Anyway, let's get to the details.
 
So, how does this thing work, exactly?
Women  pay for a subscription to the site, which enables them to receive a set  of profiles for “five Harvard University educated men” every week. Then, they choose whom to contact based on the men’s “personal and  professional qualities.” Guys with proof of a Harvard connection can register free. Only the women have to pay  because they “get all the choice and control, while the men only benefit  whenever a woman is interested in them.”
 
What types of guys are featured?
This  site is all about “dating the highest caliber men!” To see what this means, let’s take a look at a few statistics from the previously eight, but now  six, sample profiles:
 
Most popular career field: Finance or consulting. 
Most popular favorite philosopher, shared by three (now two) of the profiled men: Nietzsche, who is closely associated with  nihilism, which commonly “suggests that life is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value.”
 
Enough said.
 
What type of couples meet through this site?
 
It’s unclear. Originally, the site featured profiles of four couples, including one HBS grad paired with a hot German model  and another with a “Miss Malaysia Universe." Based on the  text at the top of the page, we thought these people had met using  DateHarvardSQ. Actually,  they hadn’t. (Many of the couples have been together for years, but the  site is pretty new).  DateHarvardSQ said they’ve made it  clear that the profiles were posted only as inspirational examples,  not actual success stories. Guess we’ll have to blame our critical  reading skills. 
 
Let’s learn about a few of these couples, shall we?
 
“Tanja  is a model from Germany and has been in Asia and Europe for work. Tanja  loves Jose’s Spanish accent and charm. Jose loves absolutely everything  about her!”
 “Levy loves everything about Anthony, even his workaholic habits!”
 
So this site is about helping Harvard men land trophy wives or helping women be gold diggers?
 
Nah.  In fact, we’re told that this is all about female empowerment. The women get to make the choices, remember? As a  spokesperson for the site explained, "Our  first and foremost priority is discerning women." 
 
But what about Harvard women? And Harvard men or women looking for same-sex relationships?
After  we contacted DateHarvardSQ, an FAQ page appeared on the site, featuring  “frequently” asked questions that were strikingly similar to the ones we had posed to them. (You can check it out here.)   Perhaps you’ll be glad to know that the site may soon be not just  about hot models getting with investment bankers—it could be about  female investment bankers getting with hot male models or even two male  investment bankers getting down to business! As they've promised: "We  will soon provide services dedicated to serving Harvard Men interested  in dating discerning men, and Harvard Women interested in dating  discerning men and women. We understand this can be frustrating in the  interim, and we truly appreciate your patience.” Just hang in there, okay folks?

For the novice freshman or the unsure upperclassman looking for an ego (but perhaps not the GPA) boost, Flyby has put together the ultimate shopping list, arguably the toughest schedule possible this semester at Harvard. So readers, fill up that study card and stop bitching about your 1-page response paper when you have friends in one of these epically difficult classes.
Physics 16: Mechanics and Special Relativity
A course certain to oscillate between love and hate for any first-year Physics concentration prospect, Physics 16 nonetheless exerts certain forces of attraction over its sizable alumni base year-after-year. Sure, the p-sets linger into the night with an undue momentum, but who never said that time wasn’t the fourth dimension? It will likely feel so when accelerating toward each week’s p-set end into the wee hours of the early morning in Leverett D-hall, home to the course’s Professor Howard Georgi '67, who is also the Leverett House Master.
Economics 1011a: Microeconomic Theory
For the utility optimizing agent, by mid-semester Economics 1011a is sure to cause at least a small dent in that indifference curve tradeoff between work and leisure. Consistently berated in the Q Guide as “notoriously difficult,” the course owes much to its always-maximizing course head, Professor Edward L. Glaeser. Second-order conditions for concavity certainly always hold, allowing this class to be the obvious local maximum when it comes to difficulty in the Economics department’s Fall undergraduate offerings. But in the end, it is a class that separates the true stars from the slugs of Harvard’s Economics department.
Chemistry 30: Organic Chemistry
Homogenous with respect to the number of undiluted chemistry concentrators in this one, few others will gain the activation energy necessary to fuel completion of this course. Catalyzed with un-dissolving desire for all things carbon, the only truly relevant mixtures will be the caffeine concoctions keeping Chem 30ers precipitating through the night on p-sets and grueling lab.
Social Studies 10
If all history hitherto were a history of course struggles, the quintessential Harvard tutorial Social Studies 10 postulates all issues of coursework inequality when stacked against the often ridiculed societal inferiors of Harvard’s science and math courses—the humanities. Endowed with a free market vengeance for assigning thick stacks of reading serving justice to the greatest good of the greatest number of history’s social thinkers, Social Studies 10 promises to inspire our generation’s Leviathan of social critiques—sure to be found among the concentration’s required Senior Theses.
ES181: Engineering Thermodynamics
Sure to slowly expand and diffuse into all aspects of your life once enrolled, ES 181 promises a heat(ed) transfer of words among your study group. Stress and enthalpy are always increasing in this course, where the only option is just blow off a little steam after having spent upwards of 10 to 15 hours on problem sets. Go for it, try out one of these p-sets, and you’ll know the true meaning of “work.”
Math 55a: Honors Abstract Algebra
Proven by exhaustion as “most difficult undergraduate math class in the country,” Math 55a rounds out Flyby’s set defined as the hardest courses at Harvard, again proven by exhaustion. A full survey of undergraduate mathematics in a single year, Math 55a includes only the subset of the few and proud of each year’s freshman class. With problem sets demanding 25 to 60 hours per week, don’t expect to find many 55ers out partying on a Thursday night, loitering around at your dorm study break, or taking that extra trip out to Brain Break. These kids work best in their own domain: it is all about eat, sleep, differentiate, and derive in these study “groups.”

It looks like the endless miserable heat may be coming to an end, even if it's just for the weekend. However, it appears that Mother Nature might be overcompensating by replacing the heat with a hurricane that could potentially dump eight inches of rain in the Boston area.
(According to Weather.com, tomorrow's forecast predicts "PM Showers." Yeah, that might be an understatement.)
According to a College-wide e-mail sent out today by Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, Hurricane Earl's exact path is not yet certain, but the storm is predicted to travel over (and drench) much of lower New England. The Harvard College website will be updated periodically with announcements related to storm preparations and "emergency information."
Our advice? Stay dry, and try not to get blown away by the "tropical storm force winds" that are anticipated. And if you still have items in storage, get them out! We heard that basement flooding is a very real possibility, but the University won't be assuming responsibility for any damages.
