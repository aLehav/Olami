After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It starts with something small: a pen haphazardly thrown on a desk, some paper strewn on a chair, maybe some sticky notes hastily stuck to a wall. Then it graduates to something slightly larger: mismatched pairs of socks that you swear you’ll get around to correcting one day, a laptop with too many tabs open, too many random files on your desktop. To be human is to live with mess, to live with uneven edges, uncertainty, and coexist amongst existential and personal chaos.
In addition to physical mess, we are also predisposed to the mess of emotions that informs the human condition. Learning to live alongside mess rather than in competition with it may allow us to understand ourselves better. After all, in terms of our position in the grand cosmos, what is our insignificant mess when compared to a universe already in such disorder?
Living with — embracing — mess may enable us to feel more comfortable amongst the universe’s inherent disorder. Though seeking to control mess is instinctive to us, learning to let even some of it go and create meaning within disorganization is also valuable.
Soon after I moved back to campus and unpacked my room, I began to look through the things I brought with me, both items that are college dorm room staples, as well as mementos from a home 2,000 miles away. As I organized, I began to wonder what exactly constitutes “mess” — if the things I hold onto for sentimental reasons were considered messy.
It’s hard to part with some items, especially if they have been touched by even an ounce of sentimental value, reminding you of a different time spent with different people when things were less complicated. These physical items are the echo of an adolescence past-lived, but these echoes can at times add clutter to our surroundings.
I’m someone who’s fascinated by organizational methods that allow people to de-densify mess with precision — techniques like KonMari. These methods seem admirable, yet also somewhat out of reach. As Harvard students, we often feel the need to have total control over the mess in the different aspects of life, however, learning to live with mess is also a vital skill to have. Ultimately, mess is intrinsic to life, so we might as well become more comfortable with it.
Our ability to create mess in personal spaces is a manifestation of personality, giving spaces character, making them uniquely us, uniquely human. Each of our dorm rooms is a unique representation of who we are, the decor and ambiance an extension of ourselves. Perhaps this is also why there’s such fascination with the insides of homes owned by public figures and celebrities — we want to feel reassured on a larger scale that our tendency to create mess is valid, that even those who have the means to remove mess altogether keep some of it on purpose.
We are also endlessly intrigued by the spaces of those who came before us. We explore the buried homes in Pompeii because seeing domestic mess that spans across the millennia humanizes those long departed in such a personal way. After all, what difference is there between disorganized stacks of paper and papyrus scrolls hastily put together?
In a world full of chaos and uncertainty, at the whim of societal and historical forces greater than ourselves, perhaps mess is a form of us regaining control, maintaining autonomy over our own spaces. A form of small protest communicating that, even though we cannot control the situations around us by and large, we can indeed control the mess within our own spaces.
As the season of spring cleaning soon approaches, and we’re left to grapple with the resulting objects, items, and mess from a year so defined by uncertainty, perhaps allowing ourselves a reprieve from the constant need to organize and compartmentalize every single aspect of our lives is actually a necessary form of self-care. May we embrace the mess intrinsic to living that we all experience as a side-effect of being human, and find the freedom to unpack a year of chaos on our own terms, at our own pace.
To create mess — to feel mess — is to be human. Hopefully, through embracing this mess, we can find better footing amongst a universe of disorder.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If academics teach us how to think, and artists teach us how to feel, then athletes teach us what our bodies are capable of — a lesson that should be valued in and of itself, because the things that we do with our bodies, and the ways we engage them, are meaningful and of importance.
Many Harvard students are happy to cheer on professional athletes, or go to Harvard-Yale, but just aren’t convinced that Harvard needs to draw the top student-athletes in addition to prizing young people at the heights of other fields.
Yet in some respects, Harvard is the “sportiest” school of them all: Harvard College maintains 42 “nation-leading Division I intercollegiate sports teams” and a full 20 percent of students at Harvard College play a varsity sport. Outside of moments of controversy, like when the “Varsity Blues” college admissions scandal dominated headlines, the lives of these students go largely ignored by non-athletes (or non-athletic-regular-people, “NARPs”) and a campus culture animated by late-night study sessions.
As part of my journey to uncover the stories of merit and meritocracy at Harvard, especially in light of the controversies, it seemed paramount to gain a glimpse into the worlds of some of Harvard’s student-athletes. I spoke with Matthew R. Thomas ’21, Charlotte F. Ruhl ’22, and Nathaniel C. Leskovec ‘23 to learn about their experiences with athletics on campus. While these three aren't reflective of the more than 1000 student-athletes at the College, their accounts paint a dynamic picture of the talent and competition central to Harvard’s brand.
Ruhl, who “walked-on” the softball team her sophomore year, has experienced life at Harvard from the perspective of both an athlete and a non-athlete. She said she understands the perceptions of non-athletes who feel that athletes are unfairly given special attention during the admissions process in the form of athletic recruitment, but believes that it’s important for Harvard to honor the skill and effort it takes to even get to the place where one has the potential to be recruited.
During normal school years, Ruhl, Thomas, and Leskovec maintained schedules that incorporated about 30 hours of training and games during their seasons.
Thomas made clear how the hours he spends playing baseball taught him the value of time and efficiency. While these skills aren’t unique to athletics by any means, as these athletes explained, being studious and quick-witted aren’t traits patented to academia. Leskovec, a football player, broke down his team’s schedule for me, detailing how much time they spend watching hours of footage of different games, taking notes, and collaborating on strategy. Ruhl explained how playing softball has shown her how to instantaneously adapt to changes on the field.
Leskovec and Thomas both remarked on how their careers in sport have taught them not only what it means to succeed as part of a team, but also how to lose and grow from their mistakes — a lesson many of our politicians would do well to learn. Though we often imagine a disconnect between being an athlete and being a student, these student-athletes integrate the two as cohesive parts of their identities.
When all is said and done, being a person who treats others with respect and decency is actually more important than acing the SATs or other accomplishments that many view athletes as lacking. The student-athletes who put in lifetimes of work into training, practice, and games deserve (at minimum) the respect of their peers and teachers.
The disregard of the work of the athletes in our academic institution also speaks to our culture’s disregard for professions that utilize our bodies — which makes itself apparent every time the minimum wage debate comes up in national politics.
The market has told us which skills are valuable and which aren’t. For years our culture has prioritized STEM education and students have been told that STEM pursuits are the “best-paying” and our learned biases are highly reflective of that. Many students of the arts and humanities are acutely aware of the undervaluing of their fields, but are less sensitive to the student-athletes who experience the constant devaluing of their contributions to Harvard’s campus by fellow students under the yoke of intellectual elitism. Yet, if we allow the market to dictate which traits and skills are valuable and which aren’t, what are we left with as individuals needing agency and inspiration?
While 90 percent of recruited athletes eventually gain acceptance to Harvard,  I’d imagine similar numbers for the top students in other fields. Recruited athletes at Harvard are more likely to be white and come from upwardly mobile backgrounds than other Harvard students proving that athletics, and like high school GPAs and SAT scores, are not immune to the race and class dynamics that stratify American society.
The complexity of admission criteria means there are a plethora of diverging opinions on the subject, and this complexity is actually a good thing. The way our society comprehends merit shouldn’t be monolithic. It ought to be diverse and flexible. The presence of athletes on campus, and every other student who embodies passion and effort, unquestionably adds texture to this diversity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard likes to win, and for the fourth time in five years, the University has outdone its Ivy League competition at federal lobbying, with an impressive total expenditure of $555,000. The University’s unmatched lobbying efforts cover a broad and sweeping assemblage of issue areas, from pursuing Harvard-specific interests — like lower taxes on our $41.9 billion endowment — to addressing wider, large-scale challenges like student financial aid, immigration laws, and federal pandemic relief for small businesses.
We remain unconvinced that federal lobbying constitutes a race that our University should be so proud to win. Like many, we are concerned about the outsized influence wielded by large corporations, special interests, and myriad other groups with cash to spend in Washington. Lobbying as a form of political engagement is inherently antidemocratic. Our government cannot simply answer to those who can afford lobbyists; at its most fundamental level, a democracy must work for the residents governed, respect the popular interest, and carry out the will of the people.
However, we understand that the mechanisms of political progress are complicated. (And we know, too, that even $555,000 is not a huge spend for Harvard.) We may wish for a Capitol free from the swarms of lobbyists and lobbying firms, but we also understand that, at present, this is an elusive and far-off ideal. Inevitably, wielding financial power on some issues and refusing to do so on others is a statement about what matters most to an institution. Alas, until the lobbying-free utopia comes — or until Congress passes stronger anti-lobbying regulation or bans the practice altogether, which really seems just as unlikely — the stance Harvard chooses to take will determine our support or encouragement for that particular University initiative.
Harvard must be political, and the spending practices of an institution are inherently political. The institutions and people that the University chooses to take its donations from, spend its money on, or invest its savings in, matter and mean much. But throwing Harvard money around Capitol Hill is not always our most effective advocacy strategy.
Instead, there exist bolder, bigger, and broader political acts whose meaning and impact are often greater than those of lobbying efforts in Washington. Whether it be a lawsuit that charts its course through the justice system, or a statement that garners national news coverage, overt and careful political endeavors like these have real, time-tested power. Policies changed, for instance, when Harvard sued federal authorities to block a directive that would have expelled all international students from staying in the United States to take online classes. Transformative feats like these serve as a testament to the tremendous influence that the University, through its political choices, has the potential to bring about.
Unfortunately, the University’s willingness to draw upon such strong tacts seems to be a wavering, inconsistent choice. The University decides when to exert its power and influence — when to be proudly and publicly political and when, seemingly in the name of convenience, to forego its values and remain silent and removed from controversy. But even as the University’s political energy seesaws, the moral imperative to be political never fades.
The administration must always promote the ideals for which Harvard strives to stand, in both its internal policies and its external advocacy. When it does so in 2021, we hope that Harvard will prioritize those strategies that leave lobbying behind.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the first piece of this column, I discussed the origins and development of two diverging notions of affirmative action: “soft” affirmative action, which avoids explicit distinctions along racial lines, and “hard” affirmative action, which calls for preferencing members of disadvantaged groups in order to increase representation and correct for past discrimination.
There is little agreement on what a “soft” or “hard” affirmative action policy constitutes. Over the past couple of decades, universities and states have experimented with various affirmative action programs. Several of these programs have faced legal challenges that have made their way to the Supreme Court, beginning most notably with Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke. In Bakke, the UC Davis Medical School used a separate admissions process for applicants from disadvantaged groups, and reserved a fixed number of seats for such applications. In Fisher v. Texas, 75 percent of the University of Texas’s class was filled according to the Top Ten Percent Plan, which granted automatic admission to students in the top ten percent of their high schools, leaving only 25 percent of the class to be admitted using a process that factored in race. Meanwhile, Harvard — currently being sued for its admissions policies — admits its entire class through a single race-conscious program, but considers race as only one of several factors. Each of these programs, though very different from each other, are “hard” affirmative action programs in the sense that they give preference to race as a factor: Today, these are known as “race-conscious” admissions programs.
Similarly, “soft” affirmative action policies vary significantly. UC Davis, in an effort to increase minority enrollment, has begun giving preference to medical students who intend to practice in underserved areas. The University of Florida grants admission to the top 20 percent of students from every high school, but also offers free tuition to 300 first-generation students. Both these programs are “soft” only in the sense that they do not explicitly preference race; they are “race-neutral.” Even these programs, however, use first-generation status or desire to work in underserved areas as a proxy for race and minority enrollment.
The core difference between the large spectrum of “soft” and “hard,” “race-neutral” or “race-conscious” programs thus comes down to the matter of giving preferential treatment to members of a particular group. Stated this way, the contentiousness of affirmative action truly lies in the issue of group rights versus individual rights. The core questions surrounding modern affirmative action policies — whether factoring race is permissible under the Constitution and whether affirmative action should be about remediation or diversity — flow directly from this issue.
The United States has a long tradition of favoring individual rights, and the Declaration of Independence is framed in uniquely individualistic terms, holding “unalienable” the individual rights to “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” The long-held national ethos of the American Dream, for example, is expressly stated in terms of individual rights. Coined by the writer James Truslow Adams in his book “Epic of America”, it described "that dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement […] unrepressed by social orders which had developed for the benefit of classes rather than for the simple human being of any and every class." In other words, an individual rights approach mandates that people are to be judged on their individual merits, not on the basis of membership in a class.
In the context of affirmative action, this means that proponents of individual rights consider it morally unacceptable to disadvantage white students solely because they do not belong to a minority group. A race-conscious affirmative action policy necessarily penalizes individual white students, even if the individuals themselves were innocent of discrimination. Similarly, members of minority races benefit solely on account of their membership in a disadvantaged group, and not on any case-by-case consideration of individual merit or harm suffered. By compensating people for discrimination suffered by a group they belong to, race-conscious policies embrace a distinctly group rights approach.
If the words of the Civil Rights Act are taken at face value, they would indicate a strong resistance to a group rights approach. Title VII, for example, prohibits employers from extending “preferential treatment to any individual or to any group” on account of race. Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr., for his part, unambiguously rejects the group rights argument in his plurality opinion in Bakke. “There is a measure of inequity,” he says, “in forcing innocent persons in respondent’s position to bear the burden of redressing grievances not of their making.”
Just a year later, in upholding private (non-governmental, unlike Bakke) race-conscious affirmative action policies in United Steelworkers v. Weber, Justice William J. Brennan Jr. took a wholly different view in his majority opinion. Embracing an anti-literal reading of the Civil Rights Act, he argued that the “spirit” and intent of the authors of the statute was to eliminate the effects of past discrimination. Quoting an earlier case, he noted, “It is a familiar rule, that a thing may be within the letter of the statute and yet not within the statute, because not within its spirit, nor within the intention of its makers.” In Brennan’s view, the Act was drafted to ameliorate the effects of discrimination faced by a group, and thus it was permissible, in order to meet that end, to adopt race-conscious policies that preferenced that group.
Powell and Brennan interpret the same statute differently to reach diametrically opposite conclusions, demonstrating their contrasting takes on the individual rights versus group rights argument. But their disagreement strikes at the heart of a more fundamental question in legal interpretation: How does one reconcile the letter of the law with the spirit of the law when the two seem to diverge? In this column’s next piece, we will examine how the Supreme Court navigates this dilemma as it attempts to determine whether there can be any legal basis for affirmative action policies.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Activists and scholars across a breadth of disciplines gathered virtually for the fifth annual student-run Black Health Matters conference this weekend to discuss the effects of systemic racism on Black health.
The Harvard Undergraduate Black Health Advocates organized the two-day event, which featured a series of keynote addresses, panels, and workshops guided by speakers affiliated with Harvard and organizations around the country.
Abigail Joseph ’21, who served as conference co-president alongside Akosua F. O. Adubofour ’21, said the purpose of the conference was to look at Black health issues through an intersectional lens.
“It felt reductive to always talk about Black people as a monolith, so I wanted our conference to kind of dig into more of those differences and to tease them out health-wise,” she said.
In her keynote address, Columbia University bioethics lecturer Harriet A. Washington said the United States’ history of abusing and misleading Black people in the development of medical research informs how Black people view medicine today.
“The flawed persons who have promulgated historical theories about medicine have devised theories that still have effect today,” said Washington, who wrote the award-winning book “Medical Apartheid.”
Still, Washington said that issues concerning Black health are not only the result of distrust. She posited the reason many Black people have not yet received the Covid-19 vaccine is because health officials coordinating the vaccine rollout did not prioritize the health of Black Americans.
“The fact that they were not getting the vaccine doesn’t mean that they’re rejecting it, it could just as easily mean that their access to it has been cut off,” she said.
Harvard School of Public Health professor David R. Williams said in his Sunday keynote that racism is a contributing factor to the reduced life expectancy of minority groups.
Williams, who serves as the Social and Behavioral Sciences department chair, said race is one of the main driving factors for health disparities, more so than differences in income and education.
“These data clearly indicate that there’s something about your socioeconomic status, income, and education that matters for your health regardless of your race, but there’s something else about race that matters even after we’ve taken income and education into account,”' he said. “In the past 25 years or so, I and other scholars have been really asking the question why does race still matter and could racism could be a critical missing piece of the puzzle to understand the patterning of racial inequalities in health.”
Williams added that the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated that disparity in life expectancy, citing a three-year decrease for African American males between 2019 and 2020.
“We need to monitor the extent to which Covid-19 is causing death and disease and pain and suffering on a large scale, but it is also having a huge negative economic impact on communities of color,” he said.
The conference also included a variety of workshops on topics such as therapy, racial bias in dermatology, and Black beauty.
Adubofour, one of the conference’s presidents, said she hopes the ideas sparked by the conference continue past the weekend itself.
“Outside of the conference, our main focus is to really engage undergraduates more in the conversation,” Adubofour said. “They’re the people that are going to be the next wave of researchers and professionals that are going to be affecting change for Black people’s health in the country.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council voted to endorse a pair of statements during its Sunday night meeting — one supporting a petition to grant tenure to Professor of the Practice of Public Philosophy Cornel R. West ’74, and another to condemn statements made by Harvard Law professor J. Mark Ramseyer.
The first piece of legislation demands the University “reopen pathways for Professor West’s tenure and further commit to advancing racial justice in substantive ways.”
West recently threatened to leave Harvard for the second time after he said the University dismissed his request to be considered for tenure. He held Harvard’s highest faculty rank, University Professor, before leaving Harvard in 2002 following a high-profile spat with then-University president Lawrence H. “Larry” Summers. West returned as a Professor of the Practice in 2017, a position that lacks tenure.
West’s intellectual and scholarly contributions to the academic field and to Harvard are “of the first order eminence,” the statement reads, quoting language from the FAS tenure handbook.
The legislation spurred debate among the UC members, particularly Pforzheimer House Representative Sarah Bolnick ’23, who claimed West to be a controversial figure due to his stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict. West has been outspoken in his criticism of Israel’s treatment of Palestinians.
Ivy Yard Representative Arjun A. Akwei ’24, the legislation’s sponsor, came to West’s defense, arguing that past controversial figures have received different responses from the administration than West.
The statement demands Harvard abolish the ad-hoc committee in the tenure process — a group of faculty chaired by the University president or provost, whose composition is secret, that makes a final decision in most tenure cases — as well as recruit more Black scholars, and establish an Ethnic Studies department, including an undergraduate concentration.
“These are only the preliminary steps that Harvard must take in order to rectify its centuries-long history of racism and move toward restoring its relationship with Black and Brown students and scholars,” reads the statement.
Sponsored by Akwei, UC President Noah Harris ’22, Kirkland House Representative Jacqueline F. Tubbs ’22, Oak Yard Representative Kimani E. Panthier ’24, and Oak Yard Representative Travis A. Johnson ’24, the legislation passed with a vote of 17-2-11.
The second piece of legislation endorsed a recent petition by the Harvard Korean International Student Association against Harvard Law School professor J. Mark Ramseyer’s controversial journal article titled “Contracting for Sex in the Pacific War,” in which he argues sex slaves taken by the Japanese Army during World War II were actually contracted sex workers.
The UC statement criticized the article — which has drawn worldwide criticism from academics and politicians — as “contrafactual.”
“Professor Ramseyer’s article debilitates the integrity of legal and historical scholarship,” the statement reads.
The UC and other signatories on the statement call on Ramseyer to formally apologize, for Harvard University President Lawrence S. Bacow, and Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 to “officially address” the article, and for the International Review of Law and Economics — the scholarly journal that published the story — to recognize the “possible shortcomings” of the article.
The endorsement was sponsored by Cabot House Representative Brooke Lee Livingston ’23, Crimson Yard Representative Jane J. Oh ’24, Elm Yard Representative Emmy M. Cho ’24, who is also a Crimson News Editor, Mather House Representative David J. Chung ’22, and Quincy House Representative Soy Choi ’23.
The act was passed by a vote of unanimous consent.
The UC also passed legislation calling the Harvard Program in General Education to restore the course Gen Ed 1076: “Dilemmas of Equity and Excellence in American K-12 Education” after administrators cut the course from the College’s offerings in 2021.
The legislation states that the Gen Ed 1076 acts as a gateway course for the Education secondary and that it has been deemed as “life-changing” course by some who took it, and asks the FAS to collaborate with the UC to raise and allocate funding needed to offer the course again.
Sponsored by Quincy House Representative Michael Y. Cheng ’22, Adams House Representative Esther J. Xiang ’22, Currier House Representative Jack M. Swanson ’22, and Panthier, the legislation passed by a vote of 31-1-2.

Harvard’s decision Friday to postpone its in-person Commencement Exercises in favor of a May virtual ceremony for the second year in a row was met with dismay but expectation from some seniors.
Thor Larson ’21 said he was disappointed and “a little surprised” there would be no in-person ceremony for seniors this May.
“I was really hoping I’d be able to walk across a stage somewhere and shake someone’s hand and pick up a diploma in person,” he said. “And I don’t even get to do that.”
Benjamin R. “Benny” Paris ’21 said he is “not a fan” of Harvard’s decision.
“I kind of had my hopes up a little bit that there could be at least a happy ending to this difficult story,” he said. “It feels to me like we could have come up with something creative.”
Paris added his reaction to the announcement was muted.
“I don’t even feel disappointed or angry. I just kind of feel numb,” he said. “I wish I had the energy or the spirit to be more upset about this.”
Satish Wasti ’21 said though he anticipated the University’s decision, he felt disappointed when he heard the news. Still, Wasti said he believes Harvard made the right call.
“I don’t see the feasibility of convening everybody, including parents, in May given the situation of vaccine rollouts and given that all countries are not doing so well,” he said. “So I completely trust Harvard’s decision.”
“I wish we could have that in our time as well, and hopefully someday we will,” Wasti added.
In the emailed announcement, University President Lawrence S. Bacow promised Harvard will eventually hold an in-person celebration for the Class of 2021. Bacow vowed the same for the Class of 2020 last year.
Larson said Bacow’s pledge “doesn’t cut it.”
“I don’t want something two years down the line after I’ve already graduated, started my job somewhere,” he said. “I want something to celebrate the achievement of graduation at the time when I graduate.”
Olivia K. Bryant ’21 said her family was ambivalent about the announcement.
“I saw commencement as this really good opportunity for them to see what I’ve been talking about for four years, and they’re not going to have that,” she said. “But at the end of the day, Commencement’s extremely expensive, and so I think they are glad that they’re not going to have to go through the extreme cost and the stress.”
Bryant, who is studying at home in England, added in an email that she and her parents would not be able to enter the U.S. for an in-person ceremony under current travel restrictions, anyway.
“Most international students would not be able to invite their families to Commencement if it were in person,” she wrote. “So I am grateful that I can ‘graduate’ with my family around me.”
Wasti, an international student from Nepal, said an in-person commencement would have brought his parents to the U.S. for the first time.
“My mother has never actually been in an airplane and my father has never taken an international flight, so it would be really their first chance to see America,” he said. “That most upset me.”
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on student reactions to the announcement.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana offered his condolences to seniors in a Friday email and wrote he is hopeful a virtual commencement will still honor the graduating class.
“As we mark almost a year since Harvard transitioned to remote learning, I am acutely aware of how different your senior year has been from what you imagined when you came to Harvard,” he wrote. “Please know that while this pandemic may prevent us from physically gathering, it will certainly not prevent us from celebrating Commencement and your accomplishments.”
Khurana also wrote that the College will provide virtual programming to supplement the celebration, including individual House ceremonies and Class Day.
Bryant said she hopes the University will plan ways to make the virtual graduation more engaging and meaningful.
“Especially as they’ve now had it in their mind that this could happen for months, I don’t really see why they can’t be putting more effort into trying to have a bit of a hybrid graduation,” Bryant said. “The ceremony is virtual, but they can help us out with other things like cap and gown and get our diplomas to us as quickly as possible.”
“I want to be able to wear a Harvard cap and gown,” she added.

The Office of Undergraduate Education is initiating a review of Harvard College’s placement exam system to streamline student support and prevent communication errors during the process, according to OUE Director of Academic Policy Sarah Champlin-Scharff.
Placement exams are intended to help students ascertain the appropriate class levels to take in fields such as the sciences, foreign languages, and music. Incoming freshmen are also required to take exams in writing and mathematics.
Students receive placement recommendations of classes that would best suit their academic skill level according to their scores.
Champlin-Scharff wrote in an email that the review will aim to “refresh policies and approaches that impact the student experience” with the goal of “increasing understanding and support.”
“We will be taking a look at the current placement exam website, thinking about the timing of recommendations, and looking for ways to enhance communication with students,” she wrote. “Considering the impact on students is central to this review.”
Champlin-Scharff added the OUE hopes to improve the efficiency of the placement exam system, which inherently touches many different Harvard departments.
“The placement exam process requires extensive coordination and collaboration with various offices and is carried out through various systematic means,” Champlin-Scharff wrote. “The review will allow opportunity to assess the effectiveness of the current system.”
The scoring ranges which are used to place students with certain scores into specific course levels, however, will not be evaluated as part of the process review, Champlin-Scharff noted.
Several students said they have run into technical problems with the placement exam process — specifically with scheduling the exams and receiving test results — in the past few years.
Alisa S. Regassa ’24, a Crimson Arts editor, described her experience with the placement exam process as “arbitrary” and “a little bit of a hassle.”
Regassa said her math exam score was different from her original score the second time she viewed her results. Her recommended placement changed from a higher level math class to an introductory level course.
“I thought it was just like me not remembering things correctly, but it turns out that maybe this is actually a mistake,” Regassa said.
Juliette B. Low Fleury ’22-’23, a business director for the Crimson, called the process of completing the Haitian Creole placement exam “frustrating” and “ridiculous.”
“For a language that isn’t really one of the main languages, if you have to schedule the exam yourself, there’s a lot of disconnect between when you schedule it and when it gets done,” Low Fleury said.
Low Fleury, a certified medical interpreter in Haitian Creole, said she reached out to her freshman dean, proctor, and placement exam coordinators in August 2018 – the fall of her freshman year – in hopes of meeting the language requirement necessary for graduation. Her exam was not scheduled until January 2020, however.
“I’ve been sending the placement [exam] people emails since before I started freshman year, and it’s kind of stressful to look into my advising report – like my.Harvard – and get emails from my deans and freshman proctors being like, ‘hey, you haven’t met the language requirement, do you know that?’” Low Fleury said. “And I’m like, ‘Yes. And I’ve been trying to do it for a really long time.’”
Although an instructor recommended Low Fleury for an Advanced Haitian Creole course following her exam, the placement exam coordinators told her in an April 2020 email that they had not received her exam result.
“I actually told them – I was like, ‘if you want me to sleep through Haitian Creole 1 and 2, I will,’” Low Fleury said. “But there’s no reason to waste two classes of my Harvard education doing something like that when I don’t have to, especially if we have such limited time on campus.”
Champlin-Scharff wrote that the process review would work to prevent such difficulties for students.
“The review is intended to create systematic efficiencies in order to prevent these sorts of student experiences in the future,” she wrote. “We will be addressing exactly these sorts of difficulties.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
House Committee chairs said they are working to create as normal of a Housing Day as possible this month, despite the abnormal circumstances of a virtual Housing Day for the second consecutive year amid an ongoing global pandemic.
“We want to try and continue the traditions, and we’re in a very untraditional circumstance being virtual,” Liam M. F. Hall ’23, a Quincy House Committee chair, said.
Housing Day — slated to take place on March 12 — is an annual spirited tradition in which upperclassmen “dorm-storm” freshmen to inform them of their assignment to one of the twelve upperclassmen houses. House Committee chairs are responsible for planning Housing Day events for their respective houses, which typically include recording a house-themed music video and planning house-wide socials.
Rachel L. Reynolds ’22, a House Committee chair for Lowell House and a Crimson Flyby chair, said building enthusiasm has been one of the major challenges in planning Housing Day.
“The biggest thing is trying to keep up the enthusiasm that there is in a normal year with Housing Day,” Reynolds said. “But that’s a little harder, especially when we try to recognize that we have a whole class of sophomores that also didn’t get a Housing Day experience, and how we can make sure that they also feel really excited about welcoming in freshmen, even when they have not necessarily had that experience yet.”
Some House Committee chairs said they were brainstorming new virtual activities for Housing Day to help establish rapport between incoming freshmen and upperclassmen.
“There are a lot of ideas that are being floated around,” said Itay Dvir ’22, a House Committee chair for Currier House. “For example, like a virtual escape room is a great way to meet some different people.”
Hall added that Quincy’s House Committee is planning a house-wide trivia night to help incoming freshmen feel “connected to the House.”
Dylan Zhou ’22, a House Committee chair for Dunster House, said he has considered recreating Dunster House virtually on a platform called Gather.town.
“You can basically build rooms that you can connect together on this platform, and it’s sort of like Pokemon: you have an avatar, and you can walk around, and you can set tables, and talk to people,” Zhou said. “We have a dining hall right now. And we’re going to try to see if people like that. If it goes well, we might try to build some other parts of Dunster, like the library.”
Besides planning house-wide activities, some House Committee chairs said they were also working on creating their Housing Day videos, a tradition in which house affiliates gather to film a music video to show off their house.
Currier House Committee chair Caroline M. Kubacki ’22 said the committee is currently “working through” their plans for a Housing Day video.
“We’re trying to balance bringing that Currier pride and also recognizing that you can’t film with large groups on campus, and Currier is currently transformed via social distance space so it’s not full of its livelihood,” she said.
Kirkland House Committee chair Elijah J. Suh ’22 said there were many technical complications with filming the video with so many students living off-campus.
“Normally, it’s easy — you would just wrangle up whatever volunteers you wanted, like shoot in your courtyard or something like that,” he said. “But now we don’t really have that, because maybe some of the people who would be normally integrated with this, or really have a passion for video-making, or design, or production, or directing — like maybe aren’t on campus.”
Michelle G. Kurilla ’22, a Mather House Committee chair and Crimson News comp director, said the Mather committee will be “mindful” while creating their Housing Day video.
“We haven’t specifically set what actual filming the video is going to be like yet,” she said. “However, we do recognize that students are both on campus, off campus, and we have to be mindful of Harvard’s policies and our moral obligations to the Cambridge community at large.”
Dean of Harvard College Rakesh Khurana said in a Thursday interview he believes it is “critical” to continue to celebrate school traditions, such as Housing Day.
“I believe that it’s really critical to continue to find ways to maintain rites of passage and transition. I especially believe that is true when it comes to Housing Day and knowing which communities that you are going to be connected to,” Khurana said.
“The pandemic has disrupted so many of our lives in so many different ways,” he added. “But I think we can be creative and nimble and upbeat about how we can make the best of the situation we have.”

Listen. We know Wellness Days are meant for you know… wellness. But sometimes we just need a little chaos in our lives! If I can’t spend the week on a beach in Cancún like the hypothetical spring break trip of all those early 2000s college movies, then I might as well have some fun with it. Apologies in advance for what is sure to be an ~interesting~ day.
