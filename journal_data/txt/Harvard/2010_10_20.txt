After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Getting into college is not exactly an easy endeavor—and not just because the applicant pool grows larger every year. The admissions process is especially difficult since the meritocratic process most admissions offices advertise turns out to be flawed. Even with policies such as affirmative action and “need-blind” financial aid in place, incoming freshmen classes still often contain disproportionate percentages of legacy students, “development admits,” and, as the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Daniel L. Golden ’78 has argued, scions of the American ruling class. Although numerous factors contribute to such disparity, one of its causes seems to be the existence of costly insider information that gives certain students—i.e., the ones willing and able to pay thousands of dollars for private college counseling, test prep services, and other expensive tips—definite advantages over others.
Any measure to increase access to that body of information should be welcomed, including the recently developed and somewhat controversial website WeGotIn.net, which allows students access to successful Ivy League applications for a nominal fee. Of course, students should exercise their judgment when studying these applications; after all, acceptance letters are issued to individuals, not to templates, and the applications for sale are available merely because certain freshmen last year were paid to submit them, not because of any superior quality. But, at its core, this new service is a positive addition to the college admissions marketplace, if only because it does what it can to level the proverbial playing field in a small but significant way.
On WeGotIn.net—the public interface of Howard Yaruss’s Application Project, Inc.—students can purchase access to a set of Brown or Columbia University applications for $19.99 each or $34.99 for both. Yaruss told The Chronicle of Higher Education that the point of his service is, essentially, to increase transparency at an extremely reasonable price. “Students spend thousands of dollars preparing for the SAT,” he said. “We’re offering this for the cost of a trade paperback.”
Although the project’s price and larger mission are certainly commendable, the product could still benefit from certain improvements. For one, the site should strive to include analysis or commentary alongside each application: By supplying the strengths and weaknesses of each submission, students will be less likely to merely mimic the contents they see. Secondly, going forward the service should ensure that a variety of different application types are represented in each set purchased, as students should not be led to think that there is only one way to write the application that will admit them to the college of their dreams.
Naturally, WeGotIn.net has encountered considerable criticism, mostly related to concerns over an increased potential for plagiarism and whether the new service in turn provides an unfair advantage to a privileged few. In terms of plagiarism, students already consult an enormous amount of online sources, sample essays, and other Internet aids when they write their applications, and this new service will hardly be a game-changer in that sense. Besides, admissions offices should do their part to ensure that no plagiarized applications are successful. And claims about unfair advantages the sight might offer ignore the simple fact that admissions offices are unlikely to admit candidates who merely emulate the form of a successful application rather than expressing themselves in their own terms. Truth be told, most criticism of WeGotIn.com should be taken with a grain of salt, as a large portion of the site’s naysayers seem to be in the business of college admissions and counseling themselves.
This new service, and others that may follow, may not be perfect, but they are nevertheless positive innovations that strive to equalize the admissions game—a game in which fairness has unfortunately come to seem passé.

Usually the issue of final clubs comes up among blockmates over Saturday or Sunday brunch. In contrast, last Friday, an initiative that opposes the current state of final clubs organized an open community discussion on the topic, with many different stakeholders present—from students who strongly dislike final clubs to students who are in and attend them. Open, honest debate on final clubs is desperately needed at Harvard, and the new final club initiative is a worthwhile endeavor because of its emphasis on this type of conversation. The College should consider sponsoring a similar educational dialogue on final clubs for freshman.
Just because final clubs are not officially recognized by Harvard does not mean that the College can functionally ignore their presence or their effects on students. One of the College’s responsibilities is to provide stewardship for its students, and final clubs have the potential to put undergraduates at risk by nature of the type of social space they constitute. Firstly, the clubs are associated with a history of complaints of sexual harassment. Massive amounts of underage drinking take place at the clubs, and attendees often arrive intoxicated and proceed to continue drinking in a male-dominated social space. Although not all final club parties necessarily end in a hospitalization or sexual assault—and such events occur elsewhere on campus as well—final clubs serve as breeding grounds for such harm.
In addition, even though there are gay members of final clubs, the type of social activity that is present and unofficially sanctioned at these clubs is overwhelmingly heterosexual, further marginalizing a segment of the student body. Moreover, the culture of exclusivity promoted by final clubs and the punch process is problematic. College administrators should not hide behind the fact that they are not legally liable for the clubs' activities; in reality, final clubs are a salient issue in the social lives of undergraduates.
Therefore, the College should sponsor a dialogue addressing the clubs’ history of allegations of sexual harassment and rape, their heteronormativity, and their culture of exclusivity. This dialogue should occur early in the freshman experience, in order to educate students as early as possible about the issues they will soon confront. Freshmen are already oriented on everything from affirmative action at Harvard to finding Emerson Hall, and a final club discussion would be a natural addition to the freshman introductory activities. It is disingenuous to warn students—as is currently done—of the dangers of alcohol, sexual harassment, and other social issues without mentioning at all how these factors apply, in the Harvard context, to final clubs. In particular, young Harvard women should not have to rely on an unofficial network of older friends to season them as to how to party safely in these spaces; not everyone is lucky enough to have such a mentor.
In order for this dialogue to be more than just an administrative referendum on final clubs, final club members should be asked to participate. The April 2009 discussion on social spaces sponsored by the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response is a good point of reference. It featured representatives from The Advocate, the Dudley Co-op, The Harvard Crimson, the Fox, and the Spee, and brought important issues to light in a constructive and respectful manner.
We can think of several concrete ways in which this dialogue might occur. A final club discussion could be incorporated into the mandatory alcohol-education session during freshmen orientation, or it could be a non-mandatory panel discussion during freshmen week. Regardless of the specifics, a College-sponsored final club forum is long overdue.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Once upon a time, a young woman had intimate relations with several student athletes around her same age. She giggled and gossiped of her conquests to her girlfriends, with whom she developed a rating system to rank the boys on various aspects of performance and attractiveness. Her friends, being fickle and jealous that her sexual success was greater than theirs, unabashedly turned around and told all their friends about the incidents, who in turn told their friends who told their friends, you get the picture. Pretty soon, the whole school, (and, it seemed, everyone in the world), knew what this girl had done. She was predictably shunned, because she was a “whore” who had acted especially inappropriately by objectifying and sexualizing these poor, hardworking boys.
This girl went to my high school. The story is one I find banal and commonplace—a detestable display of immaturity and sexism on everyone’s part. I know many people at my current school who can recount similar stories of sexual liaisons and the unfortunate consequences that subsequently arose.
So why, dear people, did some feel the need to ostracize and pick apart the former Duke student who also (gasp!) had sex and chose to recount said episodes to her friends? Who among us is truly without sin to cast the first kiss-and-tell-stone?
Despite where you think this is going, this time I’m actually not going to resort to the worn trope of “If she had been a man, this wouldn’t have happened” (although it’s probably true). I’m also not going to mention the fact that if she had been a man, her subjects would have been considered sluts who were “asking for it,” and she would probably have gotten off scot-free.
Instead, I believe the reason the Duke student’s “thesis” has attracted so much attention and dialogue is that people have finally realized that men can also be objectified and sexualized. One particularly enlightened commenter on the gossip blog Jezebel wrote “…I found myself getting somewhat angry and hurt on behalf of some of the athletes being objectified. Being called ‘subject’ and being given an aggregate on the quality of sex *is* humiliating. My view of sexual objectification has been changed, because it’s rare that the downside of male sexual objectification is explored—you can be put on a pedestal, but you can also be discarded.”
So men have realized that, in fact, they’re not OK with being judged only on their looks. A group of people valued only for their reproductive prowess and objective attractiveness? What are they, slabs of meat? Has this girl no sense of decency or value for human companionship?
The very nature of a “hookup” is mutual objectification. It’s the spontaneity of meeting an attractive person who also finds you attractive and taking advantage of the momentary connection of “I find you sexy. Let’s play.” There’s rarely the desire, time, or presence of mind if alcohol is involved, to evaluate the person based on their personality or accomplishments. From the moment eyes lock, both parties know how the night is going to end. Any further chitchat simply serves to seal the deal.
Objectification happens, and, believe it or not, it often happens to men. Yes, girls talk. And yes, we talk about the penis size and body quality of the last guy we saw naked. We all need to relax, and stop being jealous that this woman’s sex life and thesis are far more interesting that ours.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I met Aaron Eckhart the other day.
Not to name-drop or anything, but he totally talked to me about that time he asked Gwyneth Paltrow for acting advice, the fact that Sean Penn is going to attend his wedding someday, the endearing way that Steven Soderbergh just stands next to his cast members during scene takes to build rapport, and his next dream project which involves Angelina Jolie and romance comedy. He also mentioned that he studied comic books to prepare for Two-Face and brought his parents along for our meeting.
Okay, okay, so it was a Harvard University Television-sponsored event that brought me into the same room as Eckhart, but being in the room alongside other extremely excited students made me realize that we have a tendency to fawn over visiting celebrities in an effusively exuberant manner. And this has to stop. The amount of obligatory laughter that resonated throughout the room during some of his stories made me cringe. The crowd that mobbed him for photos and autographs seemed reminiscent of ever-adoring fans surrounding Mickey Mouse at Disneyland.
I suppose it’s just human nature to go a tad crazy over seeing a famous person in, well, person—especially when it’s someone whose movies you’ve watched or image you’ve seen plastered on multiple surfaces. But we should remember to maintain our composure and dignity in the presence of people we admire.
Here at school, we get a lot of celebrities dropping by. From alums like former Vice President Al Gore ’69 and John Lithgow ’67 to guests making club-affiliated appearances like Alec Baldwin at the Institute of Politics and novelist Jonathan Safran Foer with the Harvard College Vegetarian Society (not sure about that last connection either, if you ask me). We have the Office of the Arts shuttling performers in to teach workshops, and the Harvard Foundation lotterying dinner tickets with award-winning artists every year.
At different events I’ve attended, I’ve observed a pattern to the way students here respond to celebrities. First, there is the seat-snatching. You can’t breathe the same air as the Famous Person if you can’t get a chair in the place (during the Eckhart event, the girl next to me annoyingly encroached upon my chair with half a butt cheek to make room for her near-hyperventilating friend on her own seat). Second, there is the profuse head-nodding accompanied by earnest forward-leaning until one nearly falls out of their deftly-obtained seat. Third, there is the aforementioned obligatory laugher. Everyone seems to have gotten the memo that states how necessary it is to laugh loudly at each slightly off-hand and self-deprecating joke a visiting celeb tells. Fourth, there are eager and long-winded questions following the Opening of the Floor to Questions (tip to asking a good question: Remember that it’s not exactly 20/20 here). Fifth, there is the storming and stampeding towards the celeb to ask personal, self-directed questions, mostly in attempts to seek advice for one’s prospective post-graduate career.
Underlying this pattern is the constant need that we have to always be networking and making long strides towards our future careers. We act as if this is the only time we’ll ever interact with famous people again. It’s almost as if we feel that their fame will somehow rub off on us if we can get close enough to them, or that hey, maybe we’ll impress ‘em so much with that 100-word-long question that they’ll offer us an “in” somewhere.
There’s a news flash somewhere in this and it’s the fact that people who subscribe to these philosophies just come off as incredibly needy.
One girl at the event stammered to string her sentences together when Eckhart turned to her and asked what she wanted to do with her life. I suspect that I wasn’t the only person who felt her palpable need to impress him with a witty response. Another girl lingered around behind him as he signed more autographs, despite the solid fifteen minutes that had passed after she’d already taken her picture with him. A guy nodded his head repeatedly in deep gratitude, practically kowtowing before Eckhart’s well-polished shoes.
Everyone, we don’t need to come off as needy! We don’t need to impress anyone, and we certainly don’t need to prove ourselves to famous people just because they’re in established job positions. We are worthy individuals, too. There’s a good chance that someday we’ll be the ones invited back for talks and encounter younger generations seeking our pearls of wisdom.
It’s fine to look up to someone and be in awe of him or her for certain achievements and contributions in a field. But just remember that there is a way to show your admiration and keep your dignity. And no amount of name-dropping, seat-snatching, or pontificating-questioning is going to help with that purpose.
Next time: Thank, not fawn. Or, better yet: Think before you fawn.

With their focus on issues like the Recovery Act, healthcare reform, and extended unemployment benefits, Republicans and Tea Partiers have made it easy for Democrats to claim that their advocacy of small government is a ruse for protecting the interests of the wealthy. Conservatives have said almost nothing about the President’s tobacco tax increase, which hits the poor hardest and raises revenue in a highly inefficient manner.
During his first month in office, President Obama violated his pledge not to raise taxes on families making less than $250,000 a year by approving a major increase in the federal excise tax on tobacco. This included a 159 percent increase—from 39 cents to $1.01—in the tax per pack of cigarettes. The Office of Management and budget reports that tobacco tax receipts are up $5.2 billion, or 68 percent, from $7.6 billion in fiscal year 2008 to $12.8 billion in fiscal year 2009.
While higher cigarette taxes discourage smoking, they are highly regressive. The Washington-based Tax Foundation has noted that “no other tax hurts the poor more than the cigarette tax,” pointing out in 2007 that the burden of this tax hike would be 37 times heavier on the lowest-earning 20 percent of households than would be an income tax increase that raised the same amount of revenue. At a time when the poor are already under severe economic stress, this amounts to a 25 percent reduction in the Earned Income Tax Credit, assuming the poorest citizens share the new tax burden equally. But they don’t—smokers and those involved in the tobacco industry shoulder the entire cost.
Even more disturbing is the way the revenues are being spent. The tax increase funds an expansion of the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)—which provides matching grants to states to subsidize health insurance for children—that extends benefits to households earning up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level, and even higher income levels in New York and New Jersey. As the Tax Foundation observed in its 2007 analysis, 49 percent of the population is within 300 percent of the poverty line, meaning a tax that falls heaviest on a fraction of the poor is financing a health insurance subsidy for middle class children.
This is not to say there should be no tobacco tax. The standard argument for imposing taxes on cigarettes is that smoking generates an externality, meaning it imposes costs on society. For example, second-hand cigarette smoke may pollute the lungs of nonsmokers, and tobacco use can lead to health problems whose medical costs are often borne by taxpayers. These societal costs, the argument goes, should be factored into the price of cigarettes.
The problem with the recent federal tax increase—as well as many exorbitant cigarette taxes at the state level—is that it is treated as a revenue generator instead of a corrective device. Rather than determining the size of the externality associated with tobacco use and then implementing a tax to compensate for it, policymakers merely instituted a tax that would pay for their new spending program irrespective of the societal costs of smoking. Incidentally, it’s convenient to cite these costs without quantifying them, since research suggests that earlier deaths caused by smoking provide savings for Social Security, Medicare, and other entitlement programs that benefit the aged.
Other proponents of the tax contend that tobacco imposes costs on both its users and the rest of society without providing any benefits, and that the government should therefore work to minimize or eliminate the use of tobacco. Leaving aside the dangerous implication that it is the government’s role to decide whether citizens derive legitimate benefits from their consumption of a product, the appropriate way to eliminate tobacco use would be by educating the public about its health risks, or by simply banning cigarettes.
Attempting to destroy the tobacco market through taxation is bound to have adverse fiscal consequences, especially if the revenue is earmarked for an entitlement. The decline in tobacco consumption would be accompanied by a drastic loss of revenue from the cigarette tax, making the CHIP expansion unsustainable. If the tax succeeds in persuading smokers to quit, in other words, Congress would have to cut CHIP funding, or raise some other tax.
The other problem is that such a massive tax increase might only destroy the legal market for tobacco, creating wide scope for a black market; whatever revenues accrue from the tax will be partially offset by the costs associated with enforcing compliance. Increased international cigarette smuggling in the wake of the tax increase was one motivation for the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act passed earlier this year, which ramps up federal efforts to prevent tobacco tax evasion.
If the government wants to correct the externality associated with tobacco, it should quantify the externality and impose an appropriate tax. If it wants to eliminate tobacco, it should either convince the public not to use it, or prohibit it altogether. But it should not institute a “sin” tax as a revenue generator, and it certainly should not use the revenue from such a regressive tax to subsidize health insurance for ever-wealthier citizens. This sort of flawed policy is the inevitable result of government overreach; Republicans should point this out, and make its repeal a priority.

At a time when the moral values of financial firms are being publicly questioned, the widow of a multibillionaire banker has donated $12.3 million in support of Harvard’s interfaculty initiative on ethics, the University announced yesterday.
Billionaire heiress Lily Safra, 71, gave the sum to Harvard’s Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics to permanently endow graduate fellowships and support the center’s new research lab.
Founded in 1986, the center received its current name following a large gift made in the name of her late husband, Edmond, in 2004, from his foundation.
The center will use part of the funds to implement an ethics program to strengthen applications of “moral insights” modeled in part after Oxford University’s Philosophy, Politics, and Economics program, said Law School Professor Lawrence Lessig, who directs the center.
Lessig added he hopes to expand the center’s reach to undergraduates by offering ethics courses, for example, though that effort is currently in a planning phase.
Safra’s donation yesterday comes from a judgment issued to her by a French court in March, according to local media reports. The court ruled that Safra could keep a €39 million down payment a potential buyer made on Villa Leopolda—her mansion on the French Riviera, one of the world’s most expensive homes—after a deal to sell the property fell through.
Safra distributed the money to 10 charitable and education institutions, with Harvard receiving the largest slice.
“If we truly value justice and basic human dignity, ethical questions need to be part of every field of study and every policy discussion,” Safra said in a statement yesterday.
The well-known socialite and philanthropist is known for her wealth, which she accumulated through her four marriages. Her net worth is estimated at $1 billion, according to Forbes Magazine, which ranked her as the world’s 701st richest person in 2009.
Edmond J. Safra, her fourth husband, died in an arson fire in 1999.
Lily Safra’s philanthropic activities include donations to several research universities, support for schools in impoverished areas, and humanitarian relief.

The United States has seen a historic increase in incarceration rates, exceeding that of any industrialized nation, according to a recent study co-authored by Harvard Sociology Professor Bruce Western and University of Washington Associate Professor Becky Pettit.
From 1980 to 2008, the incarceration rate in the U.S. has climbed from 221 to 780 per 100,000 people, with a total of 2.3 million individuals currently imprisoned or jailed, according to the study. The study also highlighted racial imbalances exacerbated by incarceration: more than 35 percent of all African-American high school dropouts between the ages of 20 to 34 have served some form of criminal sentence, but under 13 percent of white high school dropouts in the same age range have been incarcerated.
“The main goal of our research is getting this issue [of incarceration] on the radar screen,” Pettit said.
According to Pettit, changes to both sentencing and prosecution policies have contributed to the rise in incarceration rates. By definition, the current 5.9 percent unemployment rate excludes the 2.3 million who are incarcerated, Pettit said. But 90 percent of the U.S. prison population is composed of men, a majority of whom could otherwise contribute to the workforce.
When asked about policies that should be instituted to address these increasing numbers, Pettit said that states and local governments are currently most interested in the fiscal implications of incarceration, but that there also needs to be a focus on addressing broader social inequalities associated with incarceration.
She cited a solution offered by Nobel Laureate in Economics James J. Heckman, which suggests that the best way to decrease incarceration rates is to ensure that people obtain high quality education in their early years.
Pettit and Western’s study corroborates the importance of education and the close link between incarceration and social inequality, saying that “the prison boom is embedded in the structure of American social inequality.”
“Ameliorating these inequalities will be necessary to set us on a path away from mass incarceration and toward a robust, socially integrative public safety,” the study added.
“We need to acknowledge this issue and consider it as an extremely important concern,” Pettit said.

Mark R. Johnson, a veteran Harvard administrator, has been named Harvard’s new vice president for Capital Planning and Project Management, a position created this summer to consolidate several planning offices that oversee Harvard’s construction efforts, University officials announced yesterday.
Johnson, who will step down as Harvard Law School’s director of major capital projects and physical planning, will oversee University construction projects, including Allston expansion plans.
In his new role, Johnson will report to Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp and will review the findings of the Allston Work Team, which has been charged with shaping the University’s future in Allston.
The announcement follows statements by University officials earlier to present the Work Team’s recommendations by mid-2011. But it remains unclear how concrete the team’s findings will be.
Though the University halted construction on its $1-billion science complex in Allston in Dec. 2009, Harvard plans to start construction on smaller projects, such as an executive education building in Allston and an innovation lab in the old WGBH building on Western Ave.
“My first order of business is to learn about the data the Work Team has been gathering,” Johnson said.
University administrators consolidated Harvard’s planning offices last summer by combining the Allston Development Group and the University Planning office, two separate entities that were both in charge of overseeing construction.
Johnson first came to work for the University in 2002, as a senior construction project manager at Harvard Business School, where he managed the construction of the Baker Library and Bloomberg Center, completed in 2005.
He also oversaw the construction of the Northwest Corner building on the Law School’s campus, a major project that will add classroom and office space to the school.
Johnson said in an interview yesterday that his previous experience with University capital projects has taught him the importance of working closely with the communities affected by any expansions.
Allston residents, however, have repeatedly said they feel shut out of the planning process for the University’s construction project in their neighborhood.

Children’s literature is more important than ever in an increasingly fast-paced society, according to a panel of five authors and two filmmakers hosted by the Harvard Graduate School of Education.
Brought together to view and discuss “Library of the Early Mind,” a documentary about the significance of children’s literature in modern culture, the panel began a discussion that was inspired by the film.
“The film speaks to the way that books open up a child’s creativity and imagination,” said author Padma T. Venkatraman, who participated in the discussion via videoconference from India.
“Fiction can do this in a way that nonfiction never can,” she added.
Steven Withrow, a co-producer of the film, said the goal of the documentary was to “make a film for people who aren’t quite giving children’s books their due.”
He said that literature for children provides them with an escape from the pressures of the future.
“I loved experiences with books that had nothing to do with my future,” he said. “This is the experience we write for—not to get kids into Harvard.”
The panel also rebuffed claims that the picture book has become obsolete, saying that the medium still has value in the face of technology.
Edward J. Delaney, director and co-producer of the film, dismissed the argument that children should forego picture books for more challenging chapter books.
“There are really some big ideas being spread in children’s books,” he said, including individuality, friendship, and the struggles of growing up.
Author Roger Sutton maintained that emerging technology cannot replace traditional books because it “is so dependent on print for its legitimacy.”
But panelists did not spare the children’s literature industry of criticism, saying that it had neglected important themes.
Author and illustrator Jerry Pinkney called for greater representation of interracial marriages, and author Lesléa Newman said more books should feature transgender children.
Lois Lowry, author of the children’s literature classic “The Giver,” praised the “parents and librarians and booksellers and teachers” who bridge the gap between writers and readers.
Michelle Y. Lee, an audience member and student at HGSE, said she thought the film “made people think about children’s literature in a very different way,” adding that she hopes children’s books will stay in their traditional printed form.
“I love holding a children’s book in my hands,” she said. “The pictures are so much different in a book than on a computer.”

The director of “1428”—a documentary about the aftermath of the 2008 earthquake in Sichuan, China, that killed about 70,000 people—spoke yesterday night about his experience filming the trauma of those who suffered.
The winner of the Orizzonti Prize for Best Documentary at the Venice International Film Festival in 2009, “1428”—named after the time of day when the earthquake struck—was screened at the Harvard Film Archive as part of a documentary series called “Emergent Visions.” The series was sponsored by the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies.
By observing the survivors’ daily experience of mourning and reconstructing, director Du Haibin captured the relative lack of aid provided to the residents portrayed in the film, the moral dilemmas faced by victims as they struggled to survive, and the rise of “disaster tourism” in some of the worst hit areas.
Many of the scenes in the documentary depart from the state version of the reconstruction progress and the lives of the survivors, including a scene in which one of the survivors watched the China Central Television Spring Festival Gala—where they showed a video of survivors happily celebrating Chinese New Year with indoor fireworks in a brightly lit new home—from a dim and shabby tent.
“When people watch this, they feel that they’re able to get an alternative version of reality,” said Jie Li, a College Fellow in the Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations. “It provides visual evidence for those who take television with a grain of salt.”
Sebastian Zapisek, an audience member, said that the account of the documentary differed from what he had seen in Western media, which he said was likely due to media restrictions in China.
According to Li, the film is part of the New Documentary Movement, which emerged in China in the late 1990s. Unlike American documentaries, Li said the movies of this movement are not trying to make political statements and are more open to interpretation by the audience.
The Emergent Visions is a series that brings in the productions of this New Documentary Movement, Li said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In his annual report, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith chronicled the financial setbacks and modes of recovery that marked the past year for the University’s largest school.
The Dean’s Annual Report, which was released yesterday on a redesigned FAS website, reviews the major budget cuts over the past year, during which the school pushed through its sustainability efforts, its first year of the General Education program, and its inaugural January Term.
Smith described the last year as the middle phase of a long-term process to close a $220 million budget deficit that arose in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, when the University’s endowment fell 30 percent.
The middle phase—which followed the more immediate, across-the-board cuts, such as 15 percent reductions in departmental budgets—represented a period of strategic structural changes within FAS, according to Smith.
Over the course of the last year, FAS trimmed down a $110 million budget deficit to $35 million—a remaining gap that Smith said he intends to close by the summer of 2012.
The report attributes the school’s financial recovery to factors such as successful fundraising efforts, cuts in departments’ discretionary spending, and reduced energy costs, which resulted from sustainability measures and a warm winter season.
While the Dean’s Annual Report has traditionally been published in the spring semester, Smith said in an interview last month that providing the information earlier in the year would be helpful in the lengthy fiscal and academic planning process of structuring next year’s budget.
PRESERVING THE INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL
The Dean’s Annual Report also provides a lens into the recent period of severe hiring reductions, during which the Faculty saw only limited growth after nearly a decade of high spending and faculty expansion.
There are currently 721 tenured and tenure-track faculty members in FAS—only two more than in 2008. But that figure represents an overall 16 percent increase from 2001, when the Faculty stood at 619, according to the report.
Over the course of the last academic year, FAS undertook 41 searches for new faculty members that have thus far resulted in 20 acceptances, the report stated.
The report does not detail hiring plans for the future, but Smith told The Crimson last month that he expects a similar stringency when it comes to faculty searches this year. The report itself emphasized the school’s focus on retaining top faculty.
“Faculty and graduate students are the intellectual capital underlying our educational and research mission; thus, maintaining and enhancing our world class academic reputation require sufficient funds in these critical areas,” wrote Leslie A. Kirwan ’79, FAS dean for administration and finance, in the report.
DIVERSITY IN THE FACULTY
Beyond the issue of faculty size, the report turned its attention to the gender and ethnic diversity of its faculty.
There are currently 181 female professors within FAS, constituting 25 percent of tenure-track and tenured faculty members. Despite University-wide efforts over the last five years to support gender diversity in the Faculty, the number of women in the Faculty stands at 2007 levels, according to the annual report.
The issue of faculty diversity was raised at yesterday’s Faculty meeting, during which Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Professor Elena M. Kramer briefed the community on behalf of the Standing Committee on Women.
Kramer said that the committee has analyzed the dual issues of hiring women faculty members and promoting them to tenured positions at Harvard. Female tenure-track professors, she said,  are more likely than their male counterparts to leave Harvard before receiving tenure.
Meanwhile, there has been insignificant growth in underrepresented minorities since the school limited the expansion of its faculty, according to the report. Non-white, non-Asian minorities represent slightly more than 5 percent of the Faculty.
Because there are so few minorities in the faculty, the committee could not perform a an analytical assessment of the situation analogous to that for gender diversity, according to Kramer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Professors may have poured themselves a drink last night to celebrate their contributions to the online academic world.
During yesterday’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences meeting, Stuart M. Shieber, director of the Office for Scholarly Communication, updated the members of the audience on the Digital Access to Scholarship at Harvard, an online repository for articles written by Harvard professors.
According to Shieber, nearly 4,000 articles have been stored in DASH, and over 100 FAS faculty members have written articles that have been downloaded over 1,000 times.
In honor of its contributors, DASH invited professors to drop by an open-bar gathering at Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub after yesterday’s Faculty meeting.
Shieber said that he, Harvard University Library Director Robert Darnton, and Law Professor John G. Palfrey would be bartending at the event. But he added that Smith insisted Faculty members not head over to the bar until the close of the meeting.
“[I] look forward to sharing a drink with all of you at the end of the meeting,” Shieber said.
Initiated by FAS nearly three years ago, DASH allows professors to upload and store content on the scholarly archive. The site grants contributors a wider readership and consolidates academic works into a unified portal.
AND THE AWARD GOES TO...
Nestled within the somber sections of the Dean’s Annual Report, which largely detailed the recovering financial situation of the school, was a more celebratory section about Faculty awards.
At yesterday’s Faculty meeting, Smith announced the web release of his annual report, which covers hot-button issues like the school’s fiscal status, sustainability efforts, and faculty diversity.
A 15-page-long section of the report enumerates the various honors and distinctions awarded professors from all across the disciplines.
“I am honored to continue to serve you,” wrote Smith in the opening letter to the annual report.
The list of recognitions includes History Professor Niall C.D. Ferguson’s International Emmy award for Best Documentary for his PBS series “The Ascent of Money.” In addition, African American Music Professor and Interim Dean of the Humanities Ingrid Monson received a Guggenheim Fellowship, and Economics Professor Kenneth S. Rogoff joined the National Academy of Sciences.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With nearly two weeks remaining until the election for the State Senate seat, Democratic candidate Sal N. DiDomenico and Republican candidate Barbara T. Bush continue to spar over the issues facing Massachusetts.
DiDomenico, who became state senator in May after winning a special election, said that he has “done a lot in a small amount of time,” especially with regard to jobs, education, and health care.
On the other side of the aisle, Bush, a newcomer to politics, said her fresh perspective will resonate with the electorate.
“People are concerned about the same things as I am,” she said.
IN THIS ECONOMY
In an interview, DiDomenico recounted actions taken by the State Senate since he took office to tackle unemployment, namely “an economic development bill which allows local funding to let businesses grow.”
DiDomenico said he plans to use federal stimulus funds “which is in the hands of the big banks who don’t seem to want to lend to small businesses” to encourage access to loans for small businesses, which he said would increase and retain jobs.
“We want to make sure that the money is given to the right hands,” DiDomenico said.
But, according to Bush, giving government more power over money might not lead to more jobs.
“We need to make sure that the government is not taking too much money,” Bush said. “I think we need to have a smaller government and lower taxes.”
While Bush said that investment in police and fire departments is necessary, she said that, in general, the government should “let the private sector take care of the rest.”
“Individuals spend their money more wisely than the government because the government has no limit,” Bush said.
FUNDING EDUCATION
For DiDomenico, who is himself a graduate of Cambridge Rindge and Latin and has two sons in public schools, education was another crucial issue.
“Early education is a priority for me,” DiDomenico said.
Because of the achievement gap between white and Asian students and other minority students, DiDomenico said it was important to address education issues at the elementary level.
During his time in office, he co-sponsored several amendments for early education funding.
According to Cambridge City Councillor Leland Cheung, DiDomenico has also fought shrinking budgets, large class sizes, and teacher lay-offs in schools.
For Bush, it was more important to look at other aspects of education such as the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System, an annual statewide standardized exam.
Even though Bush said she has “talked to teachers who think that the MCAS system is working well,” she said that training teachers in preparation for the test costs the state.
But Bush cautioned against a sudden, drastic overhaul.
“We need to be very careful about jumping into a new approach,” Bush said.
AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE
DiDomenico said he has been working on making sure that the cost of “health care was capped and anyone who wanted to increase it has to justify the reasons.”
“Health care is the highest number in our budget,” DiDomenico said.
As someone who, in her words, is “not a fan of health care as legislated by the government,” Bush said that “when people do not pay to be part of a system, then they feel entitled to use it.”
Agreeing that health care is a large cost for the state, Bush said that charging individuals for use of services would insure that money is used more wisely.
“I could not tell you a specific thing that has to be done because it’s a huge expense for the taxpayers,” Bush said.

Over the course of 30 days, Aman Ali and Bassam Tariq traveled 13,000 miles, visited 30 states, and prayed at 30 mosques—all the while fasting from sunrise to sunset and maintaining a blog about their experiences.
In a talk hosted yesterday by the Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Islamic Studies Program at Harvard, the pair discussed their month-long roadtrip across the nation to explore the cultural and spiritual lives of Muslims in light of Ramadan, the Islamic month of fasting.
Ali, a writer and stand-up comedian, and Tariq, a filmmaker and advertising copywriter, said that they conceived of the idea for the project after visiting 30 mosques in New York City for Ramadan last year.
With the financial help and encouragement from fans on Twitter and Facebook, the duo decided to expand their travels from New York City to the entire nation to learn more about contemporary Muslim experience in the United States.
The pair’s journey began on Aug. 11 in New York City—where they prayed at the controversial Park 51 mosque—and ended on Sept. 11 in Dearborn, Mich., home to one of the country’s largest concentrations of Muslims.
Throughout their travels, Ali and Tariq stayed and broke fast with Muslim families at each location. Tariq said that the pair did not want to stay in hotels, given the importance of sharing the experience of breaking fast with others.
Ali said that they found the United States to be generally accepting of Muslims: “To experience it at just about every stop along the way was truly amazing,” he added.
The project serves to humanize mosques during a time when these places of worship are growing increasingly controversial, particularly with the development of the Park 51 mosque, according to Ali S. Asani ‘77, professor of Indo-Muslim and Islamic religion and cultures.
Mosques are places of social gathering that represent real communities of people, said Asani, who moderated the discussion.
Members of the audience said that they appreciated the new insights gained from Ali and Tariq’s experiences.
“I think America is one of the most culturally and religiously diverse places in the world,” said Rayhnuma Ahmed ’14, who attended the discussion. “Their experiences definitely show that.”
“There are many different ways of celebrating Ramadan that I didn’t know about coming from a very conservative background,” said attendee Asmaa Rimawi ’14.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The University has shifted the start dates for fall classes over the next seven years to minimize disruptions caused by the Labor Day holiday and to alleviate the “compressed pace” of the fall semester, according to an e-mail sent to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences community yesterday.
Given that Labor Day—which always marks the first Monday of September—falls on Sept. 5 next year, classes in fall 2011 will be moved back from Sept. 6 to Aug. 31.
The schedule changes seek to ease the tightened nature of the fall semester, which was shortened last year after the University-wide calendar reform moved finals to before the start of winter break.
“[Next year’s fall semester] would have been even five days shorter than the average spring,” said Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris. “I think four, five, or six days is actually substantially shorter.”
The new start date will not result in additional days of instruction. Instead, the extra days will be likely re-allocated to reading period, exam period, or vacation days, according to Harris, who penned the e-mail statement.
“Some kind of fall break is certainly something [the College is] looking to get built into the calendar,” Harris said. But he added that the final decision rests with the University provost.
Some undergraduates said that they would like to see the additional days generated by shift in dates used to create a fall break.
“I think that in terms of the fall schedule, the fall schedule is often very crammed where you have maybe two months where there is not a big break,” said Peter Chen ’13, who served on both the Committee on General Education and the Gen Ed Planning Committee. “It would be really good to give students a break like there is in the spring, especially because a lot of other schools do it.”
Katherine W. Steele, director for freshman programming at the Freshman Dean’s Office, said that she would also support more vacation days during the fall semester.
“I’ve heard students mention that before,” she said. “I’d definitely be in favor of a fall break.”
The changes in the fall schedule were made in conjunction with other schools in the University. The proposal, which originally came from FAS, was agreed upon by other schools, according to Harris.
Freshmen dorms will open Aug. 25, and the undergraduate Houses will open Aug. 27 next year. Classes will start Sept. 4 in 2012, and Sept. 3 in 2013.
The University’s academic calendar reform took effect last year, eliminating the College’s intersession and moving finals before winter break.
According to Peter Kronheimer, director of undergraduate studies in the mathematics department, students are still in the process of adjusting to the new fall schedule.
“Half the students here have never known anything else,” Kronheimer said. “It’s been a bit of a challenge, but I think it’s worked okay.”

In professional tennis, fans generally pay attention to singles action, but Harvard’s dominating performance this weekend proved that Crimson fans should be paying more attention to the doubles.
The Harvard men’s tennis team traveled to New Haven, Conn., for the ITA Northeast Regional Championships, which started this past Thursday and ended yesterday.
Though none of the six players entered in the singles draw managed to make it past the fourth round, the Crimson dominated in the men’s doubles tournament. Of the two teams Harvard entered, one duo made it to the semifinals and another went all the way to win the championship for the second year in a row.
“I thought we had a very strong showing [at] this tournament,” Crimson assistant coach Andrew Rueb said. “I think singles was solid with a lot of players advancing really far. We still have work to do, though.”
The second-seeded team of junior Alistair Felton and sophomore Andy Nguyen were the standouts for Harvard in the tournament. The duo had a bye for the first round, then cruised through the second round, 8-4. After prevailing through tough battles in the next two rounds, the pair pulled out an 8-5 victory in the semifinals. In the final match, the Felton and Nguyen crushed their opponents, 8-3, to take the doubles title.
“I think we did pretty well,” Nguyen said. “We started out strong and closed the net really well in the beginning of the tournament. [In the third round], we started out slowly and were down two match points against Cornell. It was a rollercoaster ride in terms of energy, but we pulled it out when we needed to.”
The duo of junior Jonathan Pearlman and sophomore Christo Schultz also proved to be a formidable pair for Harvard. The team fought through the first three rounds, winning each match convincingly. After cruising through an 8-1 quarterfinal match, the two faced bad luck when they had to pull out of the tournament.
“It was really unfortunate that we had to pull out,” Schultz said. “We had to stop because I had a midterm I couldn’t get out of on Monday. I wished it could have been both of [the Harvard teams] in the final, but I’m really happy for [Felton and Nguyen].”
Though Harvard did not have as much success with its singles matches, there were still surprises from unseeded freshman Casey MacMaster and qualifier Felton. MacMaster advanced through his first three matches in straight sets before falling in a three-setter to 12th-seeded Daniel Hoffman of Yale. The rookie held the early advantage by winning the first set, 4-6, but then let the next two slip away, 6-1 and 6-2.
Felton also surpassed expectations by moving through to the third round.  He struggled through his first match, but eventually pulled out of a tiebreak in the third set. Felton then fought through two tough sets, 6-4 and 7-5, to move on to the third round, before eventually falling to Sam Fife of Brown in straight sets.
Two of the Harvard seeds, sophomores Joshua Tchan and Nguyen, both fell in the second round after having byes in the first round. Tchan lost a tough three-setter to Alex Skinner of Boston College, 7-6, 4-6, 6-4. Nguyen dropped a straight sets match to unseeded Mike Hill of Brown.
Schultz, the 14th seed, also progressed to the fourth round before going down to eighth-seeded John Huang of Yale. He won an easy straight sets match in the second round and a nail-biter in the third round, 7-6, 3-6, 7-5.
“I played great in the singles [in the first couple of rounds],” Schultz said. “Huang’s a good friend of mine. He was playing out of his mind and ten times better than me that day.”
Pearlman had similar results, receiving a bye in the first round and cruising through his next two rounds. He ultimately fell in the fourth round to the Bears’ Fife, 6-4, 6-1.
Next up for the Crimson is the Big Crimson Halloween Invitational at home next weekend. The week after, Felton and Nguyen will team up again for the ITA National Championships in Flushing Meadows, N.Y., to round out the fall season.
“We’re looking to really improve conditioning and fitness to build that strong foundation,” Rueb said. “The fall is about improving [for the spring] and we’re using a lot of time with guys individually to improve parts of their game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men's soccer team's opponent Tuesday afternoon was the No.  18 BC Eagles, and based on the way the game went, BC could have just as  well stood for "bevy of chances"  as "Boston College."
After taking a second-half lead, the Crimson (4-4-5) was unable to  withstand the offensive barrage produced by the Eagles (7-2-4), falling  2-1 in a game in which sophomore goaltender Brett Conrad was forced to  make seven saves and the Eagles fired 16 shots.
“I thought there were two good soccer teams playing today,” Harvard coach Carl Junot said. “From our standpoint, it’s disappointing to give up a lead, but I think there’s a lot of quality in Boston College’s team.”
The early part of the first half was equally paced with a lot of back-and-forth, but things soon started to pick up. Eagle midfielder Amit Aburmad had the first look on goal 12:30 into the  game, when he took a pass at the right of the net and kicked a ground  ball, but Conrad made a diving save to his right.
Soon after, Aburmad took another wide-open look but missed wide again.
Later, BC midfielder Kyle Bekker sent a corner kick on net that Conrad bobbled, putting the Crimson defense in a dangerous situation before it was finally able to clear.
At 42:55, Conrad came out of the goalie box to try to break up a one-on-one, and after a collision ensued, the keeper was penalized.  But a wall of Harvard defenders denied the resulting free kick taken by Eagle Conor Fitzpatrick.
A minute later, Eagle midfielder Colin Murphy had an open look, but shot it right at Conrad, who deflected the ball over the net, allowing Harvard to escape a scoreless first half despite four BC shots on goal.
“Conrad did well,” Junot said. “I think he was pretty consistent between the pipes.”
In the second half, it was the Crimson’s turn to come out showing some offensive firepower.
Harvard had a great scoring opportunity 4:28 into the period, when sophomore midfielder Brian Rogers—who left the game early in the first half after getting drilled in the face by a ball but returned in the second half—beat his defender down the left endline and sent a pass in front of the net to teammate Connor McCarthy.  The freshman had a great look, but BC keeper Justin Luthy made a diving deflection to his left, and after a scrum in front of the goal, the Eagles were able to clear.
“Brian had a great run on that, and I completely screwed up on it,” McCarthy said.
But McCarthy got redemption two minutes later when senior midfielder Shomesh Chaudhuri sent him a cross from the right side, and McCarthy kicked a ground ball past a diving Luthy to give Harvard the 1-0 advantage.
“Shomesh just played a really good ball, and in the end, it was an easy finish,” McCarthy said. “A lot of the work was done for me.”
But from that point on, it was all Eagles offensively.
At 58:15, Eagle forward Charlie Rugg had Conrad exposed one-on-one in the goalie box, but his ensuing shot hit the post.  Three minutes later Eagle defenseman Patrick Chin took a long outlet pass from Aburmad and sent a cross to Bekker, who took the kick from five yards out and put it into the right corner of the net to tie the game at one.
BC had another great opportunity with a two-on-one, yet Conrad was able to make a diving stop to his right on a Rugg shot to keep the game tied.
But the Eagles eventually found their way to the goal. At 66:44, Aburmad beat Conrad on a free kick to the left corner of the goal, giving the Eagles a 2-1 advantage it would not surrender.
“We really only let our guard down for like 10 minutes,” McCarthy said. “They got both goals in those 10 minutes, and it was tough to battle back.”
The Crimson wasn’t able to register any great chances the rest of the way, losing its first game in five contests and its final non-conference match.
“I thought we let up a bit after [our] goal,” McCarthy said. “We just didn’t keep our pressure high enough, and they’re a really good team, so when you don’t keep 100% focus on defense, they’ll hurt you. And they did.”
Harvard’s offense, for its part, managed 13 shots after struggling to get pressure on net in recent weeks.
“That was one of our goals this game,” Junot said. “We told ourselves before the game, the result wasn’t as important as the performance, being able to create more attack opportunities, and we did that.  So there are some positives to the game.”
“It’s a testament to Coach Junot,” McCarthy added.  “He switched up the formation, made it a bit more attacking.  Thanks to that move by him, we made some more chances...we’ll look to build off it in the Ivy League games.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a disappointing weekend in which the Harvard women’s soccer team picked up its second Ivy League loss of the season, the Crimson looked to get back on track yesterday afternoon in a nonconference matchup with Siena.
And in the early going, it looked like Harvard was on the road to recovery, jumping out to an early 1-0 lead.
But after a strong showing from the Crimson (5-6-1, 2-2 Ivy) throughout the first half, the Saints (13-2, 4-2 MAAC) took control of the contest in the second, netting the equalizer to send the game to overtime, and then scoring the golden goal in extra time to pull out the 2-1 victory at Siena Field.
“It was definitely disappointing,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “We started out really well and then we just didn’t capitalize on our chances…It comes back to bite you.”
It did not take long for the Saints to send the Crimson packing once the overtime began, as Saint Ashleigh Barone found the back of the net just five minutes into the extra period to seal the come-from-behind win.
Siena’s Sara Mikula set Barone up for the game-winner, taking the ball down the right sideline and then passing it ahead to Barone who finished with the score.
While the contest ended in disappointing fashion, Harvard looked to be in control in the early going.
Co-captain Katherine Sheeleigh spearheaded the Crimson offense from the opening whistle, taking Harvard’s first three shots. While Sheeleigh’s first two tries were denied, her third attempt found its mark.
In just the fourth minute of play, Sheeleigh recovered the ball in front of the Siena cage off a misplayed goal kick and then booted it past Saint goalie Laura Ettinger to give her team the 1-0 edge.
“She knew that the goalie was left footed so she chased the goalie down,” sophomore Aisha Price said. “The ball hit her foot and she was able to basically tap it into the goal.”
With the score, Sheeleigh moved into a tie for fifth place on the Crimson’s all-time scoring list with 28 career goals.
“[Sheeleigh] did really well,” Leone said. “She took some good shots. We’ve kind of been over passing [inside the box] but she is taking chances.”
While the forward’s goal gave Harvard the lead, it was the Crimson’s defense that anchored the squad in the first period, limiting Siena—which entered the contest averaging 2.36 goals per game—to just one shot on goal over the first 45 minutes of play.
But the Saints were not denied for much longer.
Five minutes into the second period, Saint Caitlin Cahalan was fouled inside the box and awarded a penalty kick. Cahalan made the most of her opportunity, getting the ball past Harvard keeper AJ Millet to knot the score at 1-1.
The Crimson had a number of chances to regain the lead throughout the remainder of second period, but was unable to capitalize on its opportunities.
Less than six minutes after Siena evened the score, Sheeleigh responded with two shots, but neither try was able to get past Saint keeper Elizabeth Barna, who replaced Ettinger in goal at halftime.
In the 60th minute, junior Melanie Baskind had another chance to give Harvard the lead when she was awarded a penalty kick after Siena was whistled for a handball.
But Barna denied Baskind’s attempt.
After neither team attempted a shot on goal over the next 27 minutes of play, the Crimson had one last scoring opportunity in the final minutes of regulation.
With just 3:08 left in regulation, Harvard freshman Elizabeth Weisman fired a shot at goal, but Barna managed to knock it away with a diving save, sending the contest into overtime.
The Crimson had one chance early in the extra period, earning a corner kick in the 94th minute. But Harvard was unable to get a shot off, and Siena answered with the game-winning score less than a minute later.
“It basically came down to today they played better,” Price said. “I think that it was a heartbreaking loss but we’re just going to try to keep working and pull out a win this weekend.”

If you’re looking for an excuse to trick-or-treat this Halloween, Harvard UNICEF is offering a unique opportunity. On Oct. 30, Harvard UNICEF will be organizing a Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF event here in Cambridge, followed by an auction event that will raise money for the humanitarian organization.
Groups of friends can trick-or-treat from 5:30 p.m. to 7 p.m. with the iconic UNICEF boxes. Last year, Harvard students raised almost $1,000 from trick-or-treating in local neighborhoods, according to a Harvard UNICEF press release. Harvard UNICEF will also host its 2nd annual Halloween auction and benefit party in Cambridge from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. The suggested donation to attend is $10, which includes a raffle ticket for the door prize.
For auction tickets or more information about trick-or-treating, e-mail hunicef@gmail.com. All money raised will support Harvard in the inter-ivy fundraising competition against Yale, Brown, Princeton, Columbia, and UPenn—if you really needed another reason to participate.

Popular Science recently ranked Cambridge as the 6th greenest city in America.  Needless to say, many were surprised by the story of the Kirkland squirrel.
Matthew J. Chartier ’12 took this picture on the Mac Quad Tuesday. It depicts a Harvard squirrel with part of a discarded plastic cup stuck around its neck. He circulated the picture over the Kirkland mailing list.
Chartier told us that he wanted this image to serve as a reminder not to litter. “It's one thing to sign a sustainability pledge in the dining hall,” reads the e-mail he sent over the list. It's another to actually take some initiative to keep our environment clean and safe for animals.”
Harvard takes pride in its environmental consciousness and sustainability efforts.  “Green is the New Crimson” has become a catchall phrase with the administration, and the Harvard Community Garden attracted flocks of visitors this weekend. Many students have signed the sustainability pledge, promising to reduce our school’s environmental impact.
But does this squirrel’s plight reflect negatively on Harvard’s eco-consciousness?  Chartier thinks it generally does not. He recognizes that most Harvard students are not thoughtless enough to litter. However, he makes the point that we should take initiative in picking up trash, and “not feel above doing something about it”.

ANDREW BERRY, Lecturer on Organismic and Evolutionary Biology
What time do you wake up in the morning? 
7:06. 
Who is your favorite Harvard alum, real or fictional? 
 Harvard alum? God. President Obama. [Why?] I think he’s a good guy.  
Was Larry Summers sexist? 
No. I think he was somewhat cruelly misinterpreted.
Who is the smartest person you know? 
R. C. Lewontin, who’s an emeritus professor here and who’s an alum, I guess, of this august institution.
What have you always wanted to tell tourists in the Yard? 
That’s easy. That the foot they’re touching is a storied repository of undergraduate urine.
What was your most recent CVS purchase? 
In my neighborhood I go to Rite Aid. And I think my most recent purchase was clothes washing powder, and I can’t even remember what brand it was, because that’s mandated by my wife. Not a condom in sight, sorry. 
Harvard Bookstore or Coop? 
 That’s easy. Bookstore. 
Where do you get your burritos? 
I live between Harvard   Square and Porter Sqaure, so I got to Boca Grande. It’s superior to all the offerings in Harvard   Square based on intensive sampling.
Who is the most interesting person you’ve passed on the streets of Cambridge? 
Well I’m always curious about the chess master guy outside ABP. I don’t know if he’s interesting, but I think he certainly has potential.
What’s your neurosis? 
Getting my schedule messed up and not showing up for class. 
When’s the last time you took the T? 
Yesterday a week ago, Tuesday—was it the 12th? I walk to work, and I’m a cyclist, so I tend only to use the T when I’m going to the airport. 
Describe Harvard students in one word. 
Varied.
