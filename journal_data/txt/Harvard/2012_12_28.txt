After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
So the world hasn’t ended.
No, I’m not talking about the Mayan calendar. I’m talking Harvard basketball.
The 2012-13 men’s basketball season may have started in near-apocalyptic fashion. Already reeling from the graduations of Keith Wright ’12 and Oliver McNally ’12, the Crimson lost two more starters in September when co-captains Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry withdrew from the College.
At that point, the 2012-13 campaign looked bleak for the Crimson. With Harvard returning a single starter and featuring a rookie at the point, many Crimson fans were already looking ahead to next year when Curry and Casey are expected to return to the court.
But 10 games into the 2012-13 season it is becoming more and more clear that this year’s Crimson squad should not be overlooked.
Last Saturday, Harvard held off a late Holy Cross run to take a 72-65 win over the visiting Crusaders at Lavietes Pavilion. With the win, the Crimson improved to 6-4 on the year, giving Harvard the Ivy League’s best record with just over two weeks to go until the start of conference play.
“I wish we were a little better; I wish we wouldn’t have dropped a couple of games that we were involved in prior to today, but I’m pleased with how the kids have responded to coming into this year,” said Harvard coach Tommy Amaker following the Crimson’s victory over the Crusaders. “We’ve still maintained a great deal of our identity—what we’ve always preached here.”
The rookie point guard, who entered the season a question mark, has proven to be an answer. Listed at 6’0” and 170 lbs., freshman Siyani Chambers has given opposing point guards fits all season, establishing himself as one of the Crimson’s most consistent performers.
Chambers has seen more minutes than any other Harvard player, boasting the team’s top assist-turnover ratio and three-point percentage in addition to being the Crimson’s second leading scorer.
On Saturday, the rookie turned in another strong performance, posting 14 points on seven shots and five assists in 40 minutes of play.
“It’s what we’ve been accustomed to seeing,”Amaker said. “He’s a competitor. He’s a winner.”
“He’s really confident,” co-captain Christian Webster added. “He has a lot of poise for a young guy.”
Perhaps overshadowed by the emergence of Chambers has been the rise of sophomore forward Wesley Saunders.
After scoring in double-figures just twice as a rookie, Saunders has established himself as Harvard’s top scoring threat. The athletic wing is averaging 15.8 points per game and has scored in double-digits every game this season—making him the first player to do so in 10 straight contests since Wright accomplished the feat as a junior.
The Crimson certainly has a number of holes—the biggest being its interior defense. On Saturday, Holy Cross forward Dave Dudzinski added himself to a growing list of opposing forwards to go off against Harvard (see UConn’s DeAndre Daniels’ 23-point performance on Dec. 7 or Boston College’s Ryan Anderson’s 23-point, seven rebound game on Dec. 4). On Saturday, Dudzinski needed just 10 shots to post a game-high 22 points.
“I think our post defense is pretty lacking right now,” Webster said. “We’ve got to get better at that and also helping in the post because teams are going to try to take advantage of our interior.”
Much of the Crimson’s troubles on the interior can be attributed to the squad’s small lineup; for the past four contests, Amaker has opted for a starting lineup featuring four perimeter players and Travis, a 6’6” forward.
Even so, Harvard will need to figure something out before Ivy League play when the Crimson will have to face Princeton’s Ian Hummer and Columbia’s Mark Cisco.
But the fact that this conversation is even worth having is an accomplishment in itself; just a few months ago, there were no guarantees this Crimson team would be functional, let alone in a position to three-peat as Ivy champions.
Maybe I spoke too soon—this Harvard men’s basketball team's unexpectedly successful start could be a sign that the world really is coming to an end.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
They might generally have more bounce in California, but the Harvard men's basketball team is hoping that will not be the case with its two opponents this week when it travels to the Golden State to face Cal and St. Mary's.
The Crimson (6-4) will face the Pac-12's Golden Bears on Dec. 29 and the WAC's Gaels—one of the few mid-majors to finish last season ranked in the Top 25 by the USA Today Coaches Poll—two days later in a pair of challenging contests as it winds down its non-conference schedule.
Harvard is coming off a 72-65 home win against Holy Cross in which it nearly blew a double-digit second-half lead. According to co-captain Christian Webster, the Crimson will need to improve on that performance in order to compete on the West Coast.
"Those [will be] two tough games," Webster said. "We've got a lot of work to do to be ready for those two teams."
The Golden Bears (8-3), though, have struggled against their toughest opponents this season. Over a three game stretch in early December, they got blown out by Wisconsin, lost by one to then-No. 21 UNLV, and lost by 10 to then-No. 16 Creighton. Cal's one win over a BCS-conference opponent thus far came on Nov. 23, when it topped Georgia Tech at home, 68-57. Two days later, the Yellow Jackets responded with a nine-point victory over St. Mary’s.
Cal is led by junior guard Allen Crabbe, a former elite recruit who ranks in the top 15 nationally with 20.4 points per game and is considered a potential first-round NBA draft prospect.
Redshirt junior Justin Cobbs has contributed 16.5 points per contest for the Golden Bears this season, while 6‘9” sophomore David Kravish averages 7.6 rebounds and will pose a tough matchup inside for sophomore Jonah Travis and the rest of the Crimson bigs.
Harvard has had a large amount of success against Pac-12 opponents of late, defeating Utah by 28 in the first round of the Battle 4 Atlantis last season and besting Colorado by 16 in 2010. But Crimson coach Tommy Amaker says that winning a third straight against the conference will be no easy task.
"It's a big challenge for us," he said of Harvard’s upcoming matchups. "We knew that scheduling these games, and we're [just] hopeful for a chance if we can go out and play well."
Despite their strong record, the Gaels (8-3) have yet to beat a BCS-conference opponent. But it will not be easy for the Crimson to keep pace with St. Mary’s offensively, as St. Mary's ranks in the top 15 nationally in both points per game (80.8) and field goal percentage (.509). Harvard, in contrast, is 166th and 43rd in the country in those two categories, respectively.
Australian point guard Matthew Dellavedova (18.5 points per game, 6.1 assists per game) will pose a major test for Crimson rookie point guard Siyani Chambers. But Webster believes his teammate will be up to the New Year's Eve challenge, which will be televised nationally on ESPN2.
"Siyani has been tremendous [this season]," the senior said. "He's really confident. He has a lot of poise for a young guy, and you don't see that often."
Junior guard Stephen Holt contributes 10.9 points per contest for St. Mary’s, which does not have anyone averaging over 5.7 rebounds per game—sophomore forward Brad Waldow holds his team’s top mark in the category. That makes the Gaels a potentially good matchup for the Crimson, which starts four perimeter players and has had trouble defensively against bigger teams this year.
"Our post defense is pretty lacking right now," Webster said. "We've got to get better at that.... Teams are trying to take advantage of our interior."
Harvard has never faced St. Mary’s, while it is 0-2 all-time against Cal—the most recent matchup being a 69-54 Crimson loss in 2001.
Like Harvard, both of the Crimson’s opponents this week appeared in the NCAA tournament last season, with Cal losing in its first-round playoff game to South Florida and St. Mary’s losing its second-round matchup against Purdue.
And according to Amaker, even if his team does not come away with two wins, the experience of playing a pair of strong squads will be beneficial as the schedule turns towards the conference season.
"Our goal and feeling right now is to maintain our identity, get back here, get to work, and see if we can feel good about how we played on the West Coast," Amaker said. "You can still take steps forwards even though you might not win basketball games, so we're hopeful that we can still maintain our momentum going forward."
