After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One of my earliest memories after immigrating to the United States consists of me sitting at the kitchen table when I was around five years old. As my mom washed the dishes, she gave me multiplication problems to solve. Math was its own language. It was comforting that I could understand it―even when my English was sub-par in elementary school.
My love for math, therefore, began early and continued for years to come. It was always my favorite subject and the one I was constantly praised for as I surprised myself and my teachers with how well I was performing. As my English improved, my love spread to all of STEM since I could now understand it all. My love for STEM centered on Chemistry as I started learning about gas laws during my sophomore year of high school and took AP Chemistry my junior year. More importantly, it was something that I was good at. My mom had always told me to find something that I could do well to make a lot of money because my parents didn’t have the same opportunities.
With this in mind, I entered Harvard with the full intention of studying Chemistry. My first semester, I took math and science classes along with the requirements of Expos and French. I was on the road to success that I thought I wanted and that my parents had always wanted for me—the immigrant dream often recognizes only STEM as a valid field of study.
Then November 9 happened. I remembered how fragile my future became as I watched votes go up for a man who held the fate of my undocumented community in his hands. I suddenly remembered that I had more to worry about than academics. At Harvard, I had almost started to forget that I was undocumented, but my first panic attack that day reminded me.
My mental health interfered with my plans to complete another practice midterm and paper. When I emailed my French professor for an extension, she told me to turn it in whenever I could. In Expos, we spent most of the time discussing what had happened. Meanwhile, there was no mention of the election in my math or science classes. When I asked the head Teaching Fellow for my math class if there was an option to have more time to study for the midterm, I was met with a “just do your best”.
Although I started thinking about other academic options, I stuck with STEM for another semester, knowing this was what my parents wanted but now unsure if it was what was best for me. I convinced myself that academics and personal life were separate things and I thought I had a healthy balance of the two. Second semester, I took on three board positions related to my identities that I felt I had a duty to be involved in because I couldn’t forget about the rest of my life.
But this choice hit me hard. Between all my extracurriculars, I felt like I couldn’t keep up with my classmates even though I went to the math question center  four out of five times each week. I remember sitting in my 9 a.m. lecture, looking around and wondering if people were struggling like me—not just academically, but also with this overwhelming amount of imposter syndrome and uncertainty over their futures.
The only sense of true belonging I felt was in my class on Contemporary Immigration and Education Policy at the Graduate School of Education. Professor Roberto G. Gonzales had done an in-depth study on undocumented youth in Los Angeles and his class focused around this topic. I not only felt caught up each week, but I also felt prepared and excited to participate. It was the three hour period of happiness before the five hour lab I had every other week.
It wasn’t until someone asked why I was doing STEM that I realized I no longer had an answer. I felt empty.  And I felt scared because I had always seen the way non-STEM people were viewed by STEM people. I thought leaving STEM would make me feel inferior until I saw all the geniuses that were coming out of those fields and that success did not depend on money.
Slowly, I began to become reassured by other people’s responses that what you study should be something you love. And with this support, I slowly started to free myself from those chemical chains. I looked through the courses I had always wanted to take and just the names of them excited me. This was where I needed to be—for my own self-care and my own success.
This semester, I am taking classes that feel more supportive. When reading the syllabus for one of my classes, I noticed that we had three “grace days” to use as we needed.
When the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program was rescinded, it was discussed in three out of my four classes. I witnessed my current professors getting arrested protesting the DACA repeal. And I felt like my life outside of class was validated as they recognized that my success is a product of factors beyond “doing my best.”
I recently declared a concentration in History and Literature where I can study topics that are aligned with my interests in immigration and filled with professors who I know will be there for me.
But even still, I often think about what my academic path would've looked like had I been given the right support in STEM. I wonder if I would’ve felt more welcome if I didn’t have to constantly deal with all of my intersecting identities—especially my immigration status. I am happy to have left STEM, but I also hope that STEM can become an area where students are seen as human beings dealing with questions beyond their problem sets.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This Saturday, scores of Harvard students will trek nearly 150 miles south for the 134th meeting of the Harvard Crimson and the Yale Bulldogs football teams. Though the Harvard football team is lamentably not playing for a Ivy League championship—having lost to the University of Pennsylvania 23-6 this past weekend and, alas, Yale has already clinched a share of the Ivy League championship—we are as excited for The Game this year as any previous year.
Despite the Crimson’s struggles this year, the experience of the game is equal parts cultural and athletic. In addition to an opportunity to support our peers on the football team, The Game furnishes an opportunity for both Yale and Harvard students to take a deep breath and enjoy a weekend of relaxation, revelries, and communal spirit. Especially at this dire time in the semester—when students can feel mired in a second wave of midterms, deadlines for final projects and papers that are approaching disconcertingly quickly, and the general burnout all too common among Ivy League students—The Game offers an opportunity for students to step back from their duties and enjoy a revelrous weekend.
The benefits of The Game, however, are not only individual but also collective. Harvardians are able to celebrate the rich traditions of Harvard, which are almost palpable in the air at The Game. Moreover, in a year that has been marked by occasionally-acrimonious debates over matters such as the historic sanctions on unrecognized single-gender social organizations, The Game provides an opportunity for Harvardians to put their political differences aside and unite in the face of a common foe. Though the entire experience of The Game can last under 24 hours, we hope that the communal spirit it engenders persists for longer.
Our excitement aside, we also believe that it would be a shame for students’ safety and well-being to be put at risk, and would also most likely preclude their enjoyment of The Game. For this reason, we urge students to enjoy themselves responsibly and to always keep an eye out for their peers. We also understand Yale administrators’ decision to shorten school-sponsored pregame tailgates to two hours and restrict alcohol to a centralized vendor. These modifications will help to ensure students’ safety without establishing inordinate hurdles; indeed, we think that it will be difficult for a student to enjoy The Game if they do not even make it to the Yale Bowl. Though these safety rails will help to encourage healthy habits, ultimately individual students are responsible for their own and each other’s safety, and we urge them to exercise discretion.
That’s everything you need to play for.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In April of 1958, Clifford Geertz arrived, “malarial and diffident,” in Bali. An enormously influential cultural anthropologist, he was there to study a local village, where he was intrigued by, and he found himself studying, cockfights.
Geertz described his findings in the famous essay, “Deep play: notes on the Balinese cockfight.” At these male-only events, broken beaks and bloody feathers flew, onlookers made complex wagers, and kinship ties and social prestige and manly dignity were ripped and clawed along with the cocks in the ring. A participant-observer in the ordered chaos, Geertz famously read the cockfight as a cultural text—a representation of Balinese culture.
The fight, he reasoned, expressed the inexpressible urges of animality and aggression that paradoxically underpinned the village’s social hierarchy. Subconsciously, the Balinese men were identifying themselves—their manliness, their position in society, their taboo animalistic drives—with the birds in the ring. But no matter the outcome, the cockfight never changed the village’s social order. It was simply a representation.
In almost every November since 1875, when America’s oldest rivals have clashed on the football field, Harvard and Yale have staged their own Balinese cockfight.
The Game is never really about the game. Most of us don’t wave foam fingers and shout “Yale sucks!” in sub-freezing rain because we’re passionate about Harvard football. If we did, every Ivy League football game would look like ESPN’s Big Ten College Gameday (and if you think that’s the case, just look at your state-school friends’ Snapchat Stories).
Geertz, in fact, would call Harvard-Yale a “deep play,” a situation in which the costs of losing are so high, no rational agent would participate. The athletes, banging their heads like mountain rams for Fair Harvard, risk injury and long-term brain damage. Most students in the sober minority are bored; most students in the intoxicated majority aren’t enjoying The Game so much as the tailgate shenanigans. Alumni shiver in Harvard sweaters as conniving Yalies trick them into saying their own team sucks.
No matter the score, no one wins. (If anyone needs more convincing, look no further than last year’s Saybrook Strip. Everyone lost after that quarter.) The only party even remotely close to not losing in the Harvard-Yale cockfight is MIT, which, between the 1982 great balloon hack and 1990 goal-post banner prank, has probably had the most fun laughing at the Ivy League squabblers.
If Harvard-Yale doesn’t make sense as a football game, we should try reading it, like Geertz’s cockfight, as a cultural text. The Game’s roots as a representation of something outside the gridiron actually reach back to the late 19th century. As Kim Townsend describes in her 1996 book, “Manhood at Harvard,” Harvard was said to have lost “a certain sense of manhood” after losing to Yale in the 1880s and 1890s. When Harvard threatened to suspend football after the 1984 bloodbath at Hampden Park, Townsend wrote that even Teddy Roosevelt argued that without the sport, Harvard would “turn out mollycoddles instead of vigorous men.” The Harvard-Yale clash was not so much a game, then, but a substitute for battle in post Civil-War America—a test of Harvard men’s virile virtue and gritty mettle.
Whether we realize it or not, The Game’s crunching shoulder pads, slamming bodies, shrieking whistles, and bestial crowd roars still express that struggle between elitist titans trying to prove a form of “manhood”—that proud superiority that gets at something more primal, more gutsy and character-based than academics or athletics. The long-running rivalry, amped up by football’s violence, raises the stakes to as close to life-or-death as we’re likely to get in the Ancient Eight today. It gives Harvard a chance to marshal almost savage instincts, usually caged by the classroom, to prove to itself and everyone else (even by proxy) its supremacy as the elite of the elite—not just in the classroom or on the football field, but in a sort of all-of-Harvard versus all-of-Yale total war.
And in the midst of this high-stakes struggle, Harvard-Yale generates an annual high of warlike school spirit bigger than any other event of the year. Strangers high-five and students cheer in waves of solid crimson. No one cares about House affiliation, extracurricular association, or concentration. Decked out in Harvard sweaters, united like a boisterous army front, we’re all together, and we’re all actually happy to attend Harvard.
It’s a shame that we need a rivalry with a malformed bulldog to make us feel that sense of campus camaraderie. We spend so much time hating Harvard, complaining about academic pressures, extracurricular schedules, the Undergraduate Council, administrative decisions, Brain Break, Harvard Time, Lamont bag checkers, and Expos, that we forget to take pride in our school and in each other.
School spirit isn’t just some corny excuse to sing Kumbaya at pep rallies; it’s a way of inspiring the community our administration tries to create. Maybe if we spent less time emphasizing our differences—as wonderfully diverse as they are—and more time coming together to celebrate our pride in each other and in our school, we’d have a deeper sense of community, a gratitude and excitement that lasts beyond the third Saturday of November.
For all these rough anthropological approximations, whether Harvard beats Yale 29-29, triumphs for nine years straight, or loses 21-14 to the Bulldogs’ spirit-stripping comeback, nothing changes. Harvard’s endowment is still bigger, its rankings still higher, and its prestigious reputation still wider than Yale’s. After the blood and guts and torn feathers, the social order, as Geertz analyzed, stays the same.
But if Harvard-Yale became the catalyst for a permanent attitude shift toward gratitude and real community, The Game might actually do more than represent Harvard’s gritty struggle for Ivy League hegemony. Until we can capture that sense of school pride, appreciation, and camaraderie outside the football stadium, though, Harvard-Yale will continue to be a deep play. Just in time for Thanksgiving, we’ll settle back into our old grumbling mindset: that even if we hate Harvard, at least it’s better than Yale.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 17, 2017 at 2:47 a.m.
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 will step down at the end of the academic year after 13 years in the position and 45 years at Harvard, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced Thursday.
“I want to leave on a high note and there are things out there I’m looking forward to doing,” Dingman said in an interview Thursday, adding he and his wife want to spend more time with their grandchildren and travel more.
Dingman was appointed to the position in 2004. During his tenure, he reorganized the Freshman Dean’s Office staff and launched new initiatives for freshmen like Convocation and the Reflecting on Your Life program, a series of group sessions that encourage first-year students to muse on their time at Harvard.
Dingman said he was most proud of the work he had done to develop his staff he had as dean.
“I think we have developed a deeper pool of candidates and been able to make some very good choices,” Dingman said. “I think they have one another’s back and work with I think a real sense of enjoyment, but also total commitment.”
In an email sent to College students Thursday morning, Khurana thanked Dingman for his integrity, his “calming presence,” and his passion for helping students transition from high school to college.
“Under Dean Dingman’s leadership, more opportunities have been created for informed student-faculty interaction and for taking a break from the intellectual rigor to relax and enjoy the company of peers,” Khurana wrote. “His leadership and mentorship will be truly missed.”
Since his undergraduate years at the College, Dingman has held several leadership positions at Harvard, serving initially in the Admissions office and later as a senior tutor in Leverett and Dudley Houses. He also served as Assistant Dean and Associate Dean of Harvard College, and briefly as the Interim Dean of Student Life before Katherine G. O’Dair took over in August 2016. Still, current students know Dingman best in his current role as Dean of Freshmen.
After his retirement, Dingman will continue to be involved with Harvard as a Special Adviser to Khurana, according to Khurana’s email.
“In this capacity, Dean Dingman will assist me with various special projects, including in the College’s fundraising efforts to support the student experience,” Khurana wrote. “I am grateful for his continued service to Harvard College.”
Khurana wrote in his email that he will outline a plan to search for Dingman’s successor “in the near future.”
Dingman’s retirement leaves yet another administrative role for the University to fill following announcements that University President Drew G. Faust and Radcliffe Institute of Advanced Studies Dean Lizabeth A. Cohen will vacate their positions in 2018. Dingman’s announcement also comes on the heels of several other departures—over the past year, multiple Harvard officials have left the school for other jobs, including former University Title IX Officer Mia Karvonides, former Chief Diversity Officer Lisa M. Coleman, and former director of the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Alicia Oeser.
Dingman called his decision to step down “bittersweet.”
“I’ve really felt so privileged to be able to do these different jobs and Rakesh has been an extraordinary boss,” Dingman said. “But everything has its time and I look forward to new opportunities and new challenges. I think turnover is good so I expect the Freshman Dean’s Office will benefit from new leadership.”

Stressed about exams? There’s an app for that. Caitlin Ner ’18 and Tajrean Rahman ’20 recently launched “Bliss: Harvard Mental Health,” a mobile app compiling dozens of mental health resources on campus.
Ner said she came up with the idea for Bliss in October 2016 at an “appathon”—a contest where she and three other students had 24 hours to build an app. After months of further development, Bliss joined the cohort of officially sponsored Harvard apps on the iTunes App Store and the Google Play store this fall. The app is available free of charge.
“When we won the appathon, we realized it could be something that our college could actually use," Ner said. "So we took a long time to get Harvard to officially approve it as their app rather than it just being a project.”
The app's main feature is the “Explore Your Mental Health” module, Ner said. The section prompts users to answer the question, “What are you thinking about?” by choosing one of five topics: academics, body, consent, identity, and social life. The app then suggests resources related to each of the five subjects.
“What we wanted to do is essentially take what students are thinking about and try to lead them to these resources without being too directive, but rather to guide them in the sense that you can be anywhere on campus and feel comfortable to do it at your own pace,” Ner said.
Other sections of the app include “Education,” which lists mental health-related news articles and information about national mental health organizations such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness; and “Calendar,” which displays panels, film screenings, and other events on campus held by mental health groups.
“Sometimes, you’re not aware when each of the counseling groups are doing certain things,” Ner said.
Ner said she and the other developers of Bliss hope students will take advantage of the app’s interactive features. For example, the “Get Involved” section allows users to directly contact peer counseling groups with questions or ideas. Users can also send inspirational quotes to others through the app.
Director of Counseling and Mental Health Services Barbara Lewis, one of Bliss’s faculty advisors, said she hopes CAMHS will also be able to use the app to advertise their resources like outreach events and urgent care hours. She also said CAMHS may promote the app itself.
“It certainly is something that we will likely recommend to students when they're seen at CAMHS,” Lewis said.
She added the app may be especially useful if students need additional resources like "someone to talk to at night.”
Ner said she looks forward to continuing to develop the app. “We’re just really excited about it and because there’s so much change that can happen throughout the year,” Ner said. “We are just very open to collaborating with other mental health groups and see how it can be improved.”

A higher proportion of Harvard Business School graduates are going into venture capital and private equity than in years past, according to career statistics the Business School released for its MBA class of 2017 last week.
The data shows that graduates entered professions in more than 48 industries. Financial services and consulting continue to be the most popular, comprising 31 percent and 23 percent of graduates, respectively. While the share of students going into financial services has remained relatively constant, the overall proportion of students going into venture capital and private equity in particular has increased from 10 percent in 2013 to 18 percent in 2017.
In a blog post accompanying the data, Managing Director of MBA Career and Professional Development Kristen Fitzpatrick wrote the numbers likely indicate an increased interest in leadership among graduates.
“We also saw a jump in students accepting positions in leadership development programs and general management, with 13% of the class going in that direction after graduation,” she wrote.
Several professions, however, saw small decreases. Consulting saw a two percent decrease. Technology, the third largest industry represented, also saw a decrease, from 19 percent in 2016 to 16 percent in 2017.
The report also provided demographic data about the class of 2017. Of that class of 937 students, 389 students were women and 260 were ethnic minorities. As undergraduates, 45 percent of them majored in economics or business-related fields, while 36 percent majored in STEM and 19 percent in the humanities and social sciences.
Ninety-five percent of the graduates received a job offer upon graduating, and 89 percent accepted those offers. For those who accepted, the median base salary was $135,000, which does not include signing bonuses or compensation.
“Our students continue to focus on opportunities where they can make an immediate impact, whether at a large multinational or an early stage startup,” Fitzpatrick wrote.
In recent years, the Business School has emphasized encouraging students to start their own companies. Last year, the Business School’s Rock Center for Entrepreneurship launched a Startup Studio in New York City, an incubator designed to connect startups with business school alumni.
Sixty-four of the 2017 graduates founded or co-founded a business, the same number as the previous year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Committee on Student Life approved 42 new student organizations at its monthly meeting Thursday, finalizing a process that for the first time included the Undergraduate Council’s input on new clubs.
Newly approved student organizations include the Harvard College Left Forum, the Harvard College Veterans Organization, and the Harvard Israel Summit.
Of the 19 groups which were denied recognition, the Undergraduate Council deemed many of the proposals to be “duplicative” of other organizations that already exist on-campus. Table Talk and Harvard Fitness were two such groups. At least four clubs were denied because they failed to show up for their mandatory interview.
Though the committee unanimously accepted the UC’s recommendations without revisions, several House Faculty Deans expressed concerns about the proliferation of student organizations on campus. The committee voted to establish a subcommittee that would study the issue further.
Alexander R. Miller, the College’s associate dean of student engagement, said that he understands some of the concerns about the proliferation of campus groups and will work with committee members to discuss new policies in the future.
“In the meeting, we heard from the committee an interest to not only evaluate the recognition of new groups, but also the review of current ones,” Miller said.
The Committee on Student Life is a student-faculty committee created by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to oversee the rising sophomore housing lottery, to discuss residential policies across Houses, and to grant College recognition to student organizations. Several Undergraduate Council members, Office of Student Life administrators, and House Faculty Deans sit on the body.
The Office of Student Life did not accept applications for new student organizations during the spring 2017 term as the Committee on Student Life reviewed the recognition process. In fall 2016, the last time new clubs were approved, the committee recognized 11 groups of 22 total proposals, according to Miller.
New student groups approved Thursday will hold provisional status for two semesters before undergoing review by the UC for full recognition, according to Miller. Provisional organizations will enjoy the privileges of all “recognized independent student organizations,” but will be required to meet yet-to-be determined standards.
College recognition confers an array of benefits for student groups, including the ability to apply for grant funding, reserve spaces for events, and recruit on Harvard’s campus—benefits denied to unrecognized groups, such as final clubs and Greek organizations.
The UC finalized their recommendations for the Committee on Student Life in a special session on Tuesday following a last-minute appeal process. While no Council member voted against the proposed recommendations, several representatives said they were concerned about “conflicts of interest” and a lack of external transparency in the process.
Several committee members voiced concern over the now 479 recognized student organizations. But Jack W. Deschler ’19, a committee member and Cabot House Committee co-chair, said that he is not worried about the large number of clubs.
“If there are 470 clubs and each student is in one, that is roughly 14 students per club, and that does not seem too unreasonable,” Deschler said. “Some of the most valuable pieces of my Harvard experience have been these extracurricular activities and getting to know all the people that I am surrounded by.”

Catherine L. Zhang ’19 and Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 will lead the Undergraduate Council next year after receiving 55 percent of the first-choice votes, according to UC Election Chair Matthew C. Estes ’18.
"I don't really have anything to say except thank you guys, love you guys, we should be the ones kneeling to you guys,” Zhang, a Cabot House representative said after learning she and Boucher had won the election Thursday evening. “This really means a lot, and we're really excited.”
Zhang is a Cabot House representative, and Boucher is the UC Treasurer and Mather House representative.
Only 2,074 undergraduates—less than a third of total College students—voted in this year’s election, the lowest turnout rate in at least the last six years. Last year, 3,042 undergraduates cast ballots for the UC presidency and vice presidency, a slight increase over the 2,898 ballots cast in 2015.
Zhang and Boucher faced off against two tickets: Mather House resident Conor Healy ’19 and Kirkland House representative Parth C. Thakker ’18-19, as well as Dunster House representative Victor C. Agbafe ’19 and Kirkland House resident Michael K. Bervell ’19. Presidential and vice presidential candidates Agbafe and Bervell garnered 31 percent of first-choice votes, while Healy and Thakker earned 14 percent.
Zhang and Boucher ran on a platform that endorsed establishing a multicultural center at Harvard and prioritized mental health programs and sexual assault prevention. The duo also pledged to urge Harvard to drop its appeal to the National Labor Relations Board after the NLRB’s decision to invalidate a 2016 student unionization election.
Zhang and Boucher also said they broadly support the College’s penalties on members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations, which—starting with the Class of 2021—bar members of these groups from campus leadership positions, athletic team captaincies, and certain fellowships. The other two tickets said they did not support the sanctions.
This year’s election was marked by both voting troubles and an allegation of campaign impropriety. During the voting period, students were at times unable to access the voting portal, according to Estes.
The Election Commission also investigated a charge that Agbafe and Bervell inappropriately obtained student phone numbers in order to target potential voters via text after the duo messaged several College students promoting their candidacy. The Election Commission ultimately unanimously voted against taking action on the allegation, according to Estes.
“Before we even went about doing this, we made sure to call the Election Commission and asked them for their permission and after getting it, that’s when we decided to do it,” Bervell said. “We also talked with some of the Deans at Harvard and they also said that it didn’t run afoul of the rules.”
Zhang and Boucher’s victory marks the fourth year in a row that both the UC president and vice president will assume their roles with previous experience on the Council. The last time a student with no experience on the UC was elected either body president or vice president was in 2013, when Samuel B. Clark ’15 and Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 won the Council’s election.
This year, student voters considered four referenda, including extending Thanksgiving break, bringing back “Harvard Time,” funding class-wide programming for upperclassmen, and designating physical space towards a multicultural center. All four referenda passed.
The referendum that garnered the most “yes” votes involved extending Thanksgiving break. It received 1852 “yes” votes to 152 “no” votes.
Because all referenda gained support from more than half of the voting population, all four are now considered binding and the UC must write a policy paper about each.

While many students will enjoy the three-day break for the Thanksgiving holiday, others will be busy studying for final exams in the last two weeks before the end of the term.
Courses with last-minute exams before Thanksgiving recess include Computer Science 182: “Artificial Intelligence” and French 10: “Beginning French I: French Identity Through Visual Media.”
CS182 has a midterm on Nov. 21, two days before Thanksgiving. Collin R. Price ’19, a student in the course, said that he would rather have the exam before Thanksgiving than during the last week of classes.
“I actually prefer it before break,” Price said. “I’d rather get it out of the way.”
While the midterm will occur only a few days after students travel to New Haven, Conn. for the annual Harvard-Yale football game, Price said that “it’s not terribly inconvenient.”
“I guess the timing with Harvard-Yale is kind of bad,” Price added. “Maybe this week it would have been nicer just to get it out of the way.”
While some professors assigned exams before Thanksgiving recess, other course instructors set deadlines for when students are digesting their turkey.
Freshmen in Expos 20:  “The Underworld,” like Dylan DeMarco ‘21, will have a draft of their final paper due on “Black Friday.”
“The problem that I see is that one the ideas of having a break is the fact that you should be able to choose how to spend your time with it,” Demarco said. “While you can get everything done ahead of time before the break, that’s unlikely especially since you have those assignments from other classes that are either the day after the break or the day that’s just before.”
Science of Living Systems 20: “Psychological Science” will hold its second midterm on Nov. 21. For some of the over 400 students enrolled in the course, including Sina Sadeghzadeh ’21, Thanksgiving recess will be filled with studying.
“I initially wanted to go back home for Thanksgiving and this was an incentive for me to stay,” Sadeghzadeh said.
Given that 60 percent of a student’s final grade in SLS20 is calculated using the midterms, Sadeghzadeh said that there is a lot of pressure to do well on this assessment.
“I particularly didn’t do too well on the first midterm, so this is my only chance to improve my grade, so it’s very important for me to get a good score,” Sadeghzadeh said.
He added that Thanksgiving break will provide him with more time to study.
While Daniel T. Gilbert, SLS20 course head, said that holding an exam on the first day after Thanksgiving recess is not ideal, he said that there was “absolutely no other day the exam could be held.”
“Students mainly don’t like exams no matter when they come,” Gilbert added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard officials unveiled the details of a plan to build a 9,000-square foot space for University-related arts activities—dubbed the "ArtLab"—to Allston residents at a Harvard-Allston Task Force meeting Thursday evening.
The ArtLab is part of the “innovation ecosystem” that Harvard is building in Allston, University spokesperson Kevin Casey said.
"It will be an experimental, flexible work space for faculty and students artists,” he said.
After formally announcing the plans last month, the University filed a procedural notification form with the Boston Planning and Development Agency on Nov. 2 as part of the approval process. The amendment detailed the project dimensions and building uses, along with its “community benefits.”
One benefit the University has promised is a $10,000 contribution annually for five years as part of the City of Boston’s Cultural Council Opportunity Fund program. The other initiative is a commitment to collaborate with the Ed Portal and to deliver three to six public programs tailored to the “Allston-Brighton community" per year for a minimum of five years.
Harvard spokesperson Mark Handley said he hopes these benefits will add to the success of the ArtLab.
“It would allow Allston-Brighton residents to receive more funding when applying to the grants at the city,” Handley said.
While Casey said the University will continue to integrate Allston into the functions of the ArtLab, it is unclear if Harvard will continue to roll out benefits after the five year period expires. Bruce E. Houghton, a member of the Harvard-Allston Task Force Committee, criticized Harvard for not committing to benefits that last longer at the meeting Thursday evening.
“We’d like to see the benefits timeline be cohesive with the lifetime of the building,” Houghton said. According to Casey, the ArtLab building will be temporary, with an expected lifetime of ten to fifteen years.
This is the fourth amendment that Harvard has filed to the Institutional Master Plan—the University’s blueprint for its Allston developments—since it was first approved in 2013. The first and third amendments involved structural changes to the Science and Engineering Complex while the second amendment added the Life Lab, which opened last November.
The amendment also includes updates to a Business school pavilion; a project first approved two years ago. The new structure, called the Business School Commons Pavilion, will be limited to just one story and will include an outdoor open air space.
Construction for the ArtLab is scheduled to begin in March 2018, and the building will be open for occupancy in January 2019.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Harvard graduate student was assaulted a few blocks from Mather House Tuesday evening, according to Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano.
In a citywide alert sent to Harvard affiliates Wednesday around 7:45 p.m., the Cambridge Police Department wrote that the victim was walking down Putnam Ave. from Mt. Auburn St. when she was grabbed around the waist and shoulders. She had turned around after sensing that she was being followed and was able to free herself from the attacker’s grip unharmed, according to Jeremy Warnick, spokesperson for CPD.
The victim, a 22-year-old woman, reported the incident first to the Harvard University Police Department, Warnick said. She described the assailant as a clean-shaven, 18-to-25-year-old man wearing a beanie cap.
CPD is currently investigating the incident and is still seeking suspects. The attacker was not known to the victim, and CPD deputy superintendent Leonard DiPietro noted in the alert that the attack did not follow any recent trends.
“While we are actively investigating the facts and circumstances surrounding this incident and are putting extra attention on this area, we have not seen any recent incidents similar in nature to this event,” DiPietro said.
CPD advised women to walk at a steady pace with confidence and stay aware of surroundings to avoid similar incidents.
Last month, a College student was grabbed from behind while running along the Charles River. She was able to free herself after spraying the attacker with pepper spray.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After some students found difficulty voting through the Undergraduate Council’s online portal in this year’s presidential election, students were given the opportunity to email their preferences for UC leadership to Election Commission Chair Matthew C. Estes ’18 by 2 p.m. Thursday.
Ultimately, though, due to concerns over the potential for fraudulent duplicate votes, these emailed votes were not counted, according to Estes.
Because the voting portal is anonymous, Harvard University Information Technology—which is involved in hosting the UC’s electoral portal—was unable to identify which students had already voted in the election online, according to Estes. As a result, it was impossible for the Commission to detect duplicate votes.
Estes said the possibility of duplicate voting in the election was “quite troublesome” and that “some people think we shouldn’t have even asked” for email votes.
UC President-elect Catherine L. Zhang ’19 and Vice President-elect Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 said they received numerous complaints from undergraduates about the voting system.
“Both myself and our campaign have received dozens of individual messages of voters who have been unable to vote in the election and were frustrated with the system,” Boucher said Thursday afternoon.
As a result, Zhang and Boucher set up an automatic email on their campaign website for students to send to HUIT and the Election Commission alerting them of their inability to vote.
Only one ticket—Mather House resident Conor Healy ’19 and Kirkland House representative Parth C. Thakker ’18-19—objected to email ballots.
Healy said email ballots would have given Boucher and Zhang’s ticket an unfair edge.
“The Cat and Nick campaign have directed their supporters to an online service that generates an automatic email to HUIT and the Election Commission if they have issues. We have not done this because it never occurred to us that an opportunity to have email ballots would come up,” he said.
“I suspect, to be honest, given the intimate relationship Cat and Nick have with members of the UC, that they could have seen this coming and, therefore, have a distinct advantage,” he added.
Boucher said, however, that his campaign’s automatic email was in line with UC Election Commission rules and the content of the email did not endorse his own ticket.
“The automatic email that I have set up does not in any way indicate support for our campaign. It just expresses that there’s a problem with the voting system,” he said.
Estes said Zhang, Boucher, UC President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18, Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18, and incoming Election Commission Chair Jubin Gorji ’21, are meeting with HUIT next week to discuss potential fixes to the voting portal should the Council decide to use it again. Another option, Estes said, would be to abandon the current portal and use a new voting tool that the Office of Student Life is currently developing.
“They are working on a voting tool to use for other things that would do the same thing that the voting portal we have now does,” Estes said.
The OSL’s voting platform would allow for verifying that voters are currently enrolled Harvard undergraduates and determining each student’s House or freshman yard, according to Estes. Estes said these factors are “essentially the only reason we use the portal.”

Last year, hundreds of students watched as the Harvard football team battled Yale to a close 14-21 loss in the final quarter, marking Harvard’s first loss in the annual showdown in nine years.
But Stephanie Dufresne ’20 was not among the disappointed fans.
Dufresne had lost interest and left the game at halftime. And this year, she said she does not plan to even bother attending the 2017 iteration of the game, which will take place in New Haven.
While The Game is a social and athletic event that hundreds of students at both schools spend weeks anticipating, it is also a far more quotidian time for many students more concerned with grades than the gridiron.
Dufresne—who said she will be working in a lab and spending time with a friend in Boston instead—is one of many Harvard students who will not make the trek out to New Haven this year.
Some students, like Evelyn Mo ’20, said they will be taking advantage of the weekend to extend their Thanksgiving break.
“I’m also going home on Sunday, so I thought that traveling to Yale and going home right before would be a little hectic,” Mo said.
Others—pointing to Harvard’s 14-21 loss to Yale at last year’s game—said they are not sufficiently interested in football to make the trip to Yale.
Catarina T. M. Do ’20 said that despite her upbringing in Texas, where the landscape is dotted with multimillion-dollar high school football stadiums, she does not enjoy watching the game.
“Last year, when I went, I had to make someone explain to me the rules of football,” Do said.
Other students have yet another reason. Instead of sitting in the stands this weekend, Kiera E. O’Brien ’20 said she will be participating in an athletic event herself.
“I am running the Cambridge half marathon on Sunday, so I will not be going to the game because of that,” O’Brien said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team turned in an anomalous performance in its first road matchup of the season on Thursday night, falling to Holy Cross, 73-69, at the Hart Center in Worcester, Mass.
The Crusaders (2-0) maintained a tough zone defense throughout the contest, a formation that the Crimson (2-1) had not seen in prior games. This proved to be an effective tool for Holy Cross coach Bill Carmody, as Harvard committed 23 turnovers, 12 of which were Crusader steals.
Limiting turnovers continues to be a challenge for the Crimson this season, as it came into tonight’s contest with 33 giveaways in its opening weekend against MIT and UMass. After tonight’s performance, it is evident that little improvement has been made.
“Certainly one of the big things we needed to do—that was the worst thing we did—was to take care of the ball,” coach Tommy Amaker said. “Twenty-three turnovers and their ability to get out of the blocks early put us on our heels. Playing catchup for the evening was the story of the game.”
Sophomore guard Bryce Aiken and forward Chris Lewis, the stars in last Sunday’s victory against the UMass Minutemen, had difficult nights on offense: Aiken shot two-of-nine from the field and made just one three in nine attempts, while Lewis was limited to just two points and three rebounds in 12 minutes of action.
The Crimson did see a bounce-back performance from sophomore forward Seth Towns, who led Harvard on offense with 24 points and added 10 rebounds. Additionally, freshman forward Danilo Djuricic was an important spark off the bench, delivering five blocks and 14 points. Djuricic maintained composure on both sides of the court, as the rookie sunk three triples and fouled only twice in a game in which he assumed the role as the primary low-post defender.
“I feel bad for him but I felt he played his heart out,” Amaker said. “I thought he did an exceptional job of defending around the rim and playing defense on the interior blocking shots without fouling. I thought he was our best player on the floor this evening, and we are going to need other guys to be better in order for us to win on the road.”
The Crimson struggled mightily in the first five minutes of the game, falling behind 12-2.
Crusaders junior forward Jehyve Floyd became an immediate issue for Harvard, as Floyd easily outmaneuvered Crimson forwards Lewis and Robert Baker for easy buckets at the rim. Floyd would finish with 11 points on five-of-seven shooting.
Additionally, Harvard had trouble guarding the perimeter in the first half. Relying on trap defense and double-teaming its opponents at the three-point line, the Crimson failed on numerous occasions to re-mark open Holy Cross targets and allowed easy attempts from deep. Freshman guards Austin Butler and Caleb Green each knocked down two three-pointers in the first half, while the Crusaders as a team shot 58.6 percent from the field.
Holding a 41-31 lead at the half, Holy Cross appeared to be in total control. However, Harvard slowly gnawed its way back into the contest, wearing down the Crusaders advantage to six points with seven minutes left to play.
Two straight and-one plays by Towns at the 3:51 and 3:25 marks further invigorated the visitors and narrowed the deficit down to five, but both plays were capped off by missed free throws. Although the Crimson as a team shot 10-of-14 from the line in the second half, crucial misses by Towns as well as Djuricic late in the contest made it difficult to sustain offensive momentum.
A pair of made free throws by Aiken with 53 seconds to go brought the game to 68-65, the first one-possession margin since early in the first half, but Holy Cross held on to the lead with perfect free-throw shooting in the final minute.
Five players for the Crusaders scored in double figures, compared to just three from the Crimson. Despite out-rebounding Holy Cross 40 to 27, Harvard trailed in nearly every other statistical category, including field-goal percentage, bench points, assists, and points off turnovers.
“Today, the tougher team won,” Towns said. “Overall, just a lack of toughness and too many turnovers. [We] missed a few free throws at the end. Just a bad day for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Editor’s note: This column continues a yearly tradition in which sportswriters on The Harvard Crimson and The Yale Daily News write dueling articles in advance of The Game. The column written by The Yale Daily News can be found here.
It took 10 years for Yale to beat Harvard once. A single time. Winning can be hard, apparently, but beating the Crimson took the Bulldogs longer than it took the US to build the first continental railroad, or Michelangelo to paint the Sistine Chapel ceiling, or the Revolutionary War, or the UAE to finish the construction of the Burj Khalifa.
It’s not just that 10 years is a long time, but that winning only 10 percent of the games in the last decade is atrocious. Even a Yale grad has better odds at landing a job than that. Heck, Donald Trump had a better chance of winning the election than the Bulldogs had at winning a game in the last decade. Of course, competing against a Yale grad, it’s no wonder he pulled out the victory. The Bulldogs historically choke.
Like in 2014 when Harvard scored with 55 seconds remaining to win. Or in 2009 when Yale lost 14-10 after holding a 10-point halftime lead. Just like losing to the Crimson, choking is a tradition.
Another storied Bulldog tradition is staying off the crime-ridden New Haven streets.
In anticipation of the upcoming trip to the college, I’ve purchased both a full bullet proof vest and a lock box for my valuables in addition to drafting my last will and testament.
It may sound excessive, but this is only standard procedure when traveling a city that is in the 94th percentile for crime. Yale denies a lesser percentage of applicants than the percentage of cities that are safer than New Haven.
But Yale students can always leave when they wish—which I assume is most of the time.
New Haven is, after all, only an hour’s drive from the exciting town of Hartford. If you wish to find actual civilization, that’s in Boston and only two hours north.
On the plus side, New Haven is supposed to have great pizza. But if you have a desire to eat anything besides that, you’re out of luck. Just ask former Dean of Pierson College, June Chu. The theatres are supposed to be nice though.
According to the former dean, the Criterion Cinemas allegedly has a “small theater feel without the sketchy crowds (despite it being in New Haven).”
Though one would figure that after hanging around Yale students all day, the dean would be used to sketchy crowds.
Look I get it, Yale has good architecture.
The school spends so much time talking about how pretty the buildings are that it’s almost like they’re compensating for something. After last year’s “Saybrook Strip,” at least we can now be sure what for.
Let’s not forget about the Poopertrator. But who can blame the poor student.
I would be stressed too if I attended 1270th best college in the nation. Yale’s so bad even tempered Shia Labeouf turned down the school’s scholarship offer.
Speaking of Yale students, the Bulldogs can boast five presidents and a swath of CIA agents. Contrarly, Harvard has seven presidents, five current supreme court justices, and consistently more members of congress.
The fact that Yale students go to work for the CIA just proves what everyone already knew: Yale students that graduate work for their Crimson peers.
The city of New Haven itself is a dumpster fire—no question—and at the pinnacle of that dumpster is Yale. And at the apex of that pinnacle, is the Bulldog football team.
In the last 10 contests, Yale has beaten Harvard exactly once.
In the same span of time, the Crimson won the Ivy League six times.
Sure, the Bulldogs have clinched the Ivy League but everybody really couldn’t care less. Assuming a loss on Saturday—an easy assumption to make—Yale will become the worst Ivy League champion since 1982 when another team with two losses took the title.
A blind squirrel can find a nut now and again. A broken clock is right twice a day.
Even Yale can win the Ivy League once a decade.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After two resounding victories last weekend to open its 2017-2018 campaign, the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team (2-0, 2-0 Ivy League) will look to continue its early season dominance against an unbeaten Columbia (3-0, 2-0 Ivy) squad on Friday at Uris Pool in New York, N.Y.
“We’re focused on trying to win an Ivy Championship at the end of the season, so we’re going to swim and dive pretty hard right through this meet and try our best under tough training.” Harvard coach Kevin Tyrrell said.
The team will make the 200-mile trek to take on the Lions in its first away meet of the year.
“The night before, you just try to settle in and get that meet ready type of mindset,” co-captain Bobby Ross said, “so what we do after the long bus ride is get together in the hotel and do a quick team stretch for 15 to 20 minutes to set your mindset in the right place before you go to sleep so you can visualize the next day.”
The Crimson is coming off strong performances against two other Ivy League opponents. Racing against Cornell and Dartmouth last week, Harvard bested the Big Red, 202-93, and the beat the Big Green, 216-29.
“I think we just had a good mindset over the offseason,” Ross said. “We were thinking about all the right things. Especially with swimming and diving, if you come back and you’re not in enough good shape as you should be, getting into it can be pretty tough, but our guys are always thinking about the next season and preparing, so early on we attribute it to staying in good shape and keeping a go-get it type of mentality in the offseason.”
Columbia may prove tougher competition, as it has emerged unbeaten through its first three contests. Columbia is coming off a 164-136 victory against Yale last weekend, in which diver Jonathan Suckow broke the program record in three-meter diving, which he set last week, with a score of 425.85. Suckow also won the one-meter event with a score of 380.93; he has swept the diving events in every meet for the Lions this season. On the board, Suckow will also be joined by talented fellow diver Jayden Pantel. In last week’s contest, Pantel finished in second in both three-meter and one-meter diving, with 396.37 points and 374.11 points respectively.
“Columbia is quite deep across the board,” Tyrrell said. “They have outstanding divers. They have outstanding sprint freestylers. They have some very good backstrokers, breaststrokers, so I’m not sure they have a weakness.”
The Lions also beat Army, 168-129, and Penn, 198-102, to bring their record to 3-0 on the season. Columbia has beaten its opponents collectively by 163 points through three meets, while the Crimson has a 296 point differential through two meets.
On Harvard’s side, the team will be fueled by strong relays. Last weekend, the Crimson’s three 200-yard medley relay lineups captured the top three places in the event. The A squad of senior Koya Osada, sophomore Daniel Chang, senior Steven Tan, and sophomore Raphael Marcoux finished in 1:28.92, with the other two relays finishing within a two-second spread.
“I think we’re really good at going into meets pretty fearlessly,” sophomore Raphael Marcoux said. “Given the amount of training we’ve been doing, the amount of volume in the pool, everyone is very exhausted, but we still manage to step-up and compete at a high level. So, that’s both a physical and mental strength, and they both help us to win dual meets throughout the season.
The Crimson also has immense depth in the long distance events, with the cohort of juniors and Logan Houck and Gavin Springer and senior Kent Haeffner securing the top three spots in the 1000-yard freestyle against Cornell and Dartmouth.
The 100-yard backstroke will be another exciting race to watch. Sophomore Dean Farris led the way against the Big Red and Big Green, taking the top place in an event in which he received one of his seven All-Ivy selections last season. Columbia senior Michal Zyla and sophomore Cole Stevens both touched in under 50 seconds against the Bulldogs last weekend in the event and may give Farris a run for his money on Saturday.
The 100-yard freestyle will pit Marcoux and senior Steven Tan against a strong Lions trio in freshman Albert Gwo and sophomores Kevin Dang and Hank Gullick, who all touched the wall in around 46 seconds last week.
The meet will conclude with the 400-yard freestyle, an event which the Crimson dominated in its last contest. In an exhibition event, the three Harvard entries took the top three spots, led by the B lineup of Farris, freshman Mahlon Reihman, senior Paul O’Hara and Marcoux with a blazing time of 3:00.26.
“I think across the board, every athlete in our program has been very focused this season,” Tyrrell said. “They’re determined to try to get better than the previous year, and they have lined up their actions with what their goals have been, so that’s been impressive.
The Crimson hopes to emerge from its important conference meet this season with its undefeated record intact in pursuit of its 25th Ivy League title.
“What’s great about this year, which is different, is that although we’re focused on the Ivy League Championships,” Marcoux said. “We have our sights beyond that and what we can accomplish beyond the Ivy meet at a meet like NCAA. So, that’s probably the biggest change from the previous year, but that’s what’s really bringing us together this year.”

The Harvard women’s basketball team currently sits below .500 for the first time since last year’s season opener. On Saturday, it has a chance to get back to its winning ways and improve to 2-2 on the season.
Harvard (1-2, 0-0 Ivy League) hosts Sacred Heart (1-1, 0-0 Northeast Conference) at Lavietes Pavilion this Saturday, the second game of a three-game home stay. In its last game, the Crimson scored 24 and 23 points in the third and fourth quarters, respectively, to rally to a victory against Siena University. With the victory, the team avoided dropping the first three games of the season, something it hasn’t done since the 2011-2012 season.
Harvard will look to rebound to the ways of last year when the team lost just 2 games at home. The Crimson hopes to improve on this home record in the newly-renovated Lavietes Pavilion. Construction finished in September, just in time for the new season.
“Playing at home has always been special. There’s always been a sense of protecting our space, protecting our new house.” said captain and guard Kirby Porter. “I think that playing in a newly renovated Lavietes adds an extra element of that to it. We have this new space, this new gym, we have all the nice things, but now we have to live up to that. Playing in this new space is definitely a special thing, so it adds a new sense of pride for us.”
Harvard will be looking to win two in a row on Saturday, and regain the rhythm of last year.  The Crimson finished the 2016-17 season with an impressive 21-9 record, which included a dominant run of sixteen wins in a row stretching from mid-November to early February. Harvard cooled off significantly after this streak, losing eight of its last thirteen games, and finishing third in a strong Ivy League. The Crimson will be hoping to find some of the magic, which seemed to come naturally at times last season.
As the team only contains two seniors, a younger contingent has started to emerge so far this season. Sophomore guard Katie Benzan leads Harvard in scoring this season, averaging 14 points per game, while junior guard Madeline Raster has also impressed.
While the Crimson managed to produce a lot of offense against Siena—dropping 57 points in the second half alone—defensive inconsistency continues to plague the team.
“Everybody loves to score, so I would have to confess that we are a team that does feed off of scoring, so that always helps. I would rather be a team that feeds off of defense,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “It’s more important to me that we stop the other team.”
Sacred Heart comes into the weekend matchup following a 65-61 home win over Manhattan on Wednesday, and sits 1-1 on the season. It finished last season 17-15 overall, grabbing second place in the Northeast Conference. It will be looking to make amends following last year’s matchup against Harvard, in which the Crimson ended up winning 68-60. It was one of only four home losses for the Pioneers, so they will be looking for revenge this year. Harvard has not lost to Sacred Heart since 2010-11, so extracting this revenge may prove to be a challenging.
“We made a step in the right direction in the Siena game,” Delaney-Smith added. “Hopefully we were better today, and we’ll be better tomorrow. I think we’re feeling like we’re making some headway.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Editor’s note: This column continues a yearly tradition in which sportswriters on The Harvard Crimson and The Yale Daily News write dueling articles in advance of The Game. The column written by The Harvard Crimson can be found here.
While preparing for the Sports Desk’s Yale-Harvard piece, I did what any scholarly columnist ought to do: scoured the web for disparaging Harvard news with which to fill my column. And because every headline was negative, I discovered and prepared to deploy news of the Harvard Institute of Politics granting boy-wiz Sean Spicer a fellowship in the same year that it granted Chelsea Manning one — before buckling under pressure and revoking the latter’s. I read up on how, once again, Harvard’s endowment growth was a lot like the Roman Empire’s: quite impressive before it wasn’t. I was all set to make snide remarks about how Harvard will win a whopping zero fall Ivy League championships.
If I was going to mention all these things in my column—which I of course abstained from doing—they would depict an institution resolutely inferior to our own. But instead, I decided to be magnanimous and overlook these flaws—shortcomings that our (Sterling, wink wink) PR team would have handled far better. But I’ll be the bigger man and focus this article on us, on Yale. Because, all jokes aside, Saturday will be a time—somewhat paradoxically—that is both singularly tailored to, and also entirely indicative of, our Yale experience.
As a history major, my farthest class is in WLH. Or, to stay on topic, about the length of a football field away from where I live. This means I almost never travel up Science Hill. As such, I end up missing the chance to see or even perhaps meet a large part of our student body. Such is the plight of many busy Yale students. We hurry by, task to task, class to class, day to day. But on Saturday, we all have no excuses: Thanksgiving break begins the day before the game. With nothing to do, and (hopefully) no assignments hanging over our heads, all of campus will take to the tailgates. In this sense, the freedom we all have to go to the game is quite unusual.
But one thing that has defined our experiences is that our parties and tailgates will be open to every person who comes — which in this case, is all of Yale. As my esteemed predecessor at the News put it perfectly, The Game is a Yalie’s “chance to yell and scream while surrounded by thousands of your peers, whether you’re the football fanatic or the friend asking what first down is.” And, despite never having met many of the students with whom I’ll share this memorable day  — a product of our typical experience — on Saturday, our bond will never be stronger. This makes The Game unique.
For the football fanatic, tomorrow might be mainly about the fact that Yale, one season removed from the bottom of the standings, stands on the precipice of an outright title. This, for the four classes of sports enthusiasts currently attending Yale College, is unique.
And for the many more in the stands who are wondering why the field has so many damn lines, The Game is a chance to rub arms and handwarmers with the entire student body. Because, even if you don’t like football, even if your chief concern is staying awake after tailgating for the first time, you’re sharing that struggle with all your fellow classmates. Thus, for the sports averse, the game is unique in more than the obvious way.
For the thousands of alumni who attend, The Game is both a nostalgic experience and a new, visceral one. Saturday will be familiar for older alumni, who will walk into a packed stadium as they did every Sunday when Yale was one of the top teams in America. Yet, it will be new to see the stands full, in 2017. A returning graduate of any age will see many changes. Two new colleges have been erected and a longstanding college name has been changed. But despite those changes, a return is still a return. More than anything, campus will be familiar, reminiscent of fond memories.
It is impossible for a Yalie, or really anyone, to fully encapsulate what The Game means. But maybe nothing more is needed than to say that it is both something new and also intrinsic to who we are.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
McDonald’s french fries typically do not provide insight into hockey strategy. Yet, for the Harvard women’s hockey team, this savory food provides the perfect representation for how the Crimson needs to approach the upcoming games against Holy Cross.
“Our coach told us an anecdote about how McDonald’s french fries are consistent no matter where you go,” junior defense Kaitlin Tse said. “Similarly, consistency is going to be a big theme for Friday, especially since it’s an out of league play.
For the first time in program history, Harvard women’s hockey will take on non-conference competition Holy Cross—not once, but twice. The first game on Friday will be a 6 p.m. home game at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center. On Saturday, the Crimson will make the return trip to face the Crusaders at 2 p.m. at the Hart Center. This will be this first time since the October 2006 match against Rensselaer that Harvard women’s hockey faces a completely unknown team.
“Since Holy Cross is a completely new opponent for us, it’s going to be a bit tricky,” freshman forward Lunasa Sano said. “However, I think our main points to focus on are the same: pay attention to detail and hustle.”
The Crimson stands strong at 3-1-1, with wins against Dartmouth (4-1), Princeton (3-2), and Brown (6-3), along with one loss against Quinnipiac (2-1). Additionally, the 24-10-1 record of the Harvard women’s hockey team against new competition further suggests favorable results. Yet, despite success so far in the season, the overall unfamiliarity of the matchup this upcoming weekend means that setting the tone early on will be integral to success for Harvard women’s hockey.
“Friday night we are going to play our game,” Tse said. “We are going to use our size and speed. We are going to try to get a lot of shots on net, from players all over the rosters—freshman to seniors, and from defense to forwards.”
And with team where over one third are freshman, utilizing the talent of younger players has certainly been key. With four goals in five games, two of which were scored in the 6-3 win against Brown, freshman forward Brooke Jovanovich leads the Crimson. This past Tuesday November 14, freshman forward Brooke Jovanovich was awarded the ECAC Hockey Rookie of the Week.
Other Harvard players that will certainly be key in the upcoming matches against Holy Cross include sophomore forward Val Turgeon who, with the first goal around the 15:27 mark in the November 11 match against Yale, helped the Crimson skate to a 2-2 tie. On the defensive side, sophomore goalie Beth Larcom has held the team down with a .925 save percentage.
But skating to a win against the Crusaders may pose some difficulties.  Though Holy Cross lost 3-2 to Dartmouth, who the Harvard women’s team beat 6-3 this season, the Crusaders are second in the NEWHA and have a 88% success rate for the penalty kill through nine games, while the Crimson’s success rate is 77.3% on the penalty kill through five games.
Players that the Harvard women’s hockey team will need to keep an eye on include senior forward Kara Violette, who leads Holy Cross with nine points in nine games, along with senior forward Kelsey Goostrey and freshman forward Katie MacCuaig, who each have scored four goals this season. Additionally, freshman goalie Julia Pelletier’s .939 save percentage with a 4-0-1 record may pose challenges for the Crimson offense.
However, if the Harvard women’s team remains consistent, the Crimson should expect to see favorable results.
“If we come prepared and play consistent as coach said, we should be fine.” Tse said.
