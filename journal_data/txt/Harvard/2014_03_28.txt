After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Sometimes infinitesimal changes to proven formulas still create innovative and remarkably unique works. The fourth song off of Indiana rapper Freddie Gibbs’s and producer Madlib’s first full-length collaboration, “Piñata,” is one of the best single-track exemplifications of this theory: “High” sounds a lot like Styles P’s 2002 smash hit, “Good Times (I Get High).” The two tracks sample the same 1970s Capitol Records classic “I Get High (On Your Memory),” Gibbs sounds eerily like Styles and covers much of the same cannabis-centric subject matter, and Madlib employs the same brief snippet of Freda Payne’s ethereal vocals for the hook. Instead of remaining laid-back and returning to the chorus, however, Madlib ups the bass and chops up the sample further as a particularly manic and energized Danny Brown enters the fray. The shift, though still not a radical departure from Styles’ track, is exhilarating and jarring. “Piñata,” which is chock full of little-known smooth samples, odd syncopations, and street-smart lyrics from Gibbs, is a lush 1970s dream world buoyed by Madlib’s homage-laden but unmistakable production.
 
Freddie Gibbs presents himself as a hard-edged drug dealer without a heart of gold. A surrogate Los Angeles resident, he raps about his infatuation with moving coke, having sex with a plethora of women, and improbably escaping incarceration or death at the hands of rival dealers. Gibbs is the perfect partner to Madlib’s bipolar beats. His flow is as constant as a metronome and his voice low and foreboding. A more lyrical or rhythmically experimental rapper could easily get lost in Madlib’s tangled samples. Gibbs lets his producer do the experimentation, while he focuses on crafting his tough tales and keeping up with his backing music’s changes. He performs this task astonishingly well. His voice is both intimate and intimidating—at moments he briefly softens up his tone with lines about his prison stint and parents’ deaths, only to return twice as hard with irreverent and drug-fueled rhymes like “My Filipino bitch, she fly me to L.A. to fuck / I weigh my options, I’d rather be cookin’, cuttin’, and weighin’ up.” Gibbs may have a bit of a one-track mind, but his delivery and compatibility with Madlib’s style makes up for any lack of range.
 
This style makes 2004 Kanye West look like a slacker when it comes to sampling deep cut 1970s soul tunes. He culls from an astonishing array of soul, funk, and R&B labels, including the under-appreciated Nemporer and Chelsea Records. He mixes audaciously, mashing up spidery guitar lines with organ solos and putting cymbals above driving bass. With the exception of Payne’s familiar hook, he only flirts with well-known samples, often introducing a song only to subvert it beyond recognition or drop it altogether. In “Lakers,” Gibbs’s ode to Los Angeles, Madlib introduces the legendary Cannonball Adderley Quintet’s version of “Mercy, Mercy, Mercy,” only to stir it into a frenetic horn loop to trigger Gibbs’s fast-rapping recollection of his pilgrimage to the West Coast. Madlib maintains the perfect balance between beauty, which he finds in troves through string bridges and soaring female vocals, and aggression, which comes in the form of the aggressive loops. He often switches between the two moods so smoothly and suddenly that it’s almost impossible to find the exact moment of transition.
 
Gibbs and Brown aren’t the only rappers who manage to ride alongside Madlib’s unpredictability. There isn’t one lazy or derivative feature on the album. Odd Future features prominently, with members on the gorgeous “Robes” and epic nine-minute final track. Domo Genesis, whose fierce wordplay and appealing tenor register is particularly impressive, corrals some of Madlib’s most challenging change-ups with his complex rhyme schemes. Earl Sweatshirt is also brilliant in a brief verse on “Robes,” where he offers one of the most introspective sentiments on the album in a meditation on his neglectful father. And even less-expected artists seem at home: Mac Miller raps deliberately over twangy guitar and does his best “Exorcist” scream on the climactic title track. None of the featured rappers break the timelessness of the work; this is not an album for references to fads, and the consistently philosophical and timeless rhymes offer just the right amount of relief from Gibbs’s hood obsessions.
 The album’s only weakness is its concept: the 1970s throughline, which Madlib punctuates with a number of outros and interludes from blaxploitation films, never really takes off. Gibbs often seems out of touch with his contemporaries, only infrequently referencing modern athletes and technologies, but he certainly doesn’t evoke Superfly either. Instead, “Pinata” is more thematically akin to mid-’90s G-funk. Madlib’s beats still work fantastically, but the copious soundbytes come off as a contrived and unnecessary attempt to ground the record in the decade from which it gets most of its aural inspiration. It’s hard to give the team too much flak for their failed pastiche, however, as the songs work so well; Madlib, Gibbs, and their featured team have created a kinetic, listenable, and subtle rap album that is both a fascinating musical pastiche of the past and and an unexpectedly fresh amalgamation of styles.

A lot has been said about divestment.
 But nobody has said anything louder than the group Divest Harvard. Since President Faust came down against divestment in October, the organization has voiced relentless criticism of her decision. This reached a climax when it posted a video of several students following Faust around the Yard, arguing about divestment, as she walked to her office.


 The debate format of walking arguments—called in some circles a “walkie-talkie,” an “arguemovement,” or a “troll stroll”—was criticized by Faust in an email she wrote later to the group, which expressed her disappointment in the video’s lack of “civility and fairness.” 
Of course, such a “unique” discussion arrangement may not be the best way to explore the subtleties of divestment. For instance, it may not touch on the argument (presented in a popular op-ed by Victor C. Wu ’16, a Crimson editorial executive) that as long as society is dependent on fossil fuels, Harvard’s divestment will not affect energy companies’ profits or political power—only technologies and policies that lower our demand for fossil fuels will. Or Faust’s point that the endowment’s growth furthers education and research in environmental policy and technology. Or her claim that selling Harvard’s shares in fossil fuel companies could have a “substantial” impact on the endowment’s growth, while it would have little impact on that of the fossil fuel companies. Or Wu’s point that fossil fuel companies are investing hundreds of millions in green energy anyway.
But one idea you can get from a “walkie-talkie” is very simple: On the surface level—the level most students have time to think about—divestment seems to pit the little guys against the big guys. Students are seen fighting against Exxon and the Harvard Corporation. Grass roots organizers are seen fighting against huge corporate pockets. And they all can be seen fighting at a dramatic, high-octane, brisk walking pace. 
Faust and other divestment skeptics have repeatedly stressed that they support fighting climate change—it’s just that divestment isn’t an effective way of doing so. But when debating in such an erratic way, the distinctions in their positions go unheard. Rather, only a simple message comes through: If you reject divestment, you reject the environment itself.
Sure, it’s inaccurate, unfair, and alienating. But when people follow one another around with a camera, reducing environmental issues to images of ridiculous simplicity, there’s no other way—they have to fight at that level. They have to fight simple with simple. In order to “participate” in the conversation, they have to fight the environment. 
And, well … so … since no one else is going to do that any time soon, I figured I might as well give it a try.
Don’t get me wrong. Like many of you, I’ve lived on Earth for most of my life. It’s a nice place. Though hurricanes suck and the whole “night” thing feels like a bit of a waste, it’s a solid planet overall.
But sometimes, when I picture the “environment” specifically, the only images I can think of are of mud-soaked animals, urine-infested seas, and trees either shedding for winter or spreading their reproductive organs around for spring. At the end of the day, nature is dirty. And it completely goes against our clean, man-made world.
For the sake of argument, let’s look at the best that environmentalists have to offer—trees. Majestic and strong, they are environmentalists’ greatest symbols for nature’s beauty and power.  But even these seemingly silent, wooden creatures are harmful to the endeavors of humanity. Their main function is sucking up the carbon dioxide that keeps the weather nice and warm. And the only thing they have to offer us in return is oxygen—something we already have so much of, it’s basically free. They mysteriously lurk over us, waiting and “barking” all the time. And when they strike, it’s not pretty. The New York Times reported that (this is real) falling tree branches have killed at least three New Yorkers, wounding many more, in the last 10 years. Obviously, the trees are against us. And if we don’t stop them, they won’t be the saps—we will.
It’s not just trees. We already have weather warning systems, structures with 90-degree angles, Lysol sprays, and everything else we’ve built to fight Mother Earth as a whole. So when Florida goes underwater, inclement weather destroys the countryside, Al Gore has his greatest vindicating moment since the first videos of Kim Kardashian were posted on the internet he invented, and the environment is lost forever to climate change, will that really be such a defeat? 
Honestly, I don’t know. 
All I know is that the divestment movement is quickly spreading to campuses across the country. And I know that the “point of no return” for climate change is approaching just as fast. A lot of people have already spoken out to protect the Earth. Some of them are loud. And a few of them are aggressive. 
But when there is pressure to make change happen—just when time is short and the ramifications of failure are horrific—that’s when being panicked and aggressive is most costly. Rather, the only way to make meaningful change is to listen to one another and fight patiently, together, in the face of adversity. Maybe if we can do that and do that now, we won’t have to regret everything else that comes later. 
Otherwise, I’ll just be here with a grin on my face and some more anti-tree puns on my tongue. I never gave those poor saps the full “treetment” anyway.

Nice weather we’re having.
 
No, really. I mean it. Sure, the winter has lasted so long that Punxsutawney Phil might as have well developed a new sign to indicate the direness of the situation. Perhaps he could have dropped dead on the spot after popping his little groundhog head out of the hole. But every cloud—even one that sheds inch after inch of snow, sleet, and freezing rain—has a silver lining.
 
First off, snow rocks. Ask any eight-year-old with canceled classes. He sees a full day ahead of snow angels, men, and balls. Admittedly, Harvard did better last year in the class-canceling department. But you’ve got breaks between classes, and now that you’ve added at least an additional 10 years to those eight, your sense of creativity has developed to the point of artistic genius. Didn’t you see that Easter Island head in the Yard a few months back? And here I was thinking nothing could top the nine-foot tall snow phallus a few enterprising undergraduates erected in 2003. Word on the street is that there are also some pretty fancy things you can get done in an igloo given the right supplies and motivation.
 
Okay, I’ll admit it. Too much of anything, glorious snow included, can quickly turn from beneficial to bothersome. But think: It’s common knowledge that you can’t appreciate the good without the bad and the ugly. If everything were always sunshine and puppies, the sun wouldn’t seem nearly so bright nor the puppies so cute. Both would just seem normal. Listen to the wildly popular (at least according to my own “Top 25 Most Played”) “Let Her Go” by Passenger: “You only miss the light when it’s burning low.” Even more topically, you “only miss the sun when it starts to snow.” And boy has it been snowing.
 
Not only has it been snowing. It has also been cold. So, so cold. The bone chilling air, although seemingly nothing but miserable and frostbite-inducing (seriously, my roommate got frostbite), boasts a number of boons. Who wants to trod forlornly down wet streets after snow has melted? Better to have the Cambridge sidewalks coated with sheets of sleek ice. The slipperiness offers an exercise in coordination. Plus, skating is loads of fun, and you can save a pretty penny parading in public rather than taking the T all the way to the Boston Common’s frog pond. Once you master the art, glide all the way to class—you’ll get there in no time, saving you a few minutes of precious sleep.
 
What’s more, in single-digit temperatures, Harvard students can don their chicest winter attire—even in the (nominal) spring. Why spend half a grand on a Canada Goose coat if you can only wear it for a few months? And don’t pretend you don’t want to show off those fantastically furry boots for as long as possible. Maybe Janelle Monae will even take advantage of the low degree count to spice up her Yardfest wardrobe. Might I suggest harkening back to Aretha Franklin’s inauguration-stealing headgear?
 
Speaking of fancy hats, doesn’t the Hound on Game of Thrones put fashion week models to shame? Because winter in at the Wall strikes even the staunchest Stark and lowers the lordliest Lannister. So when you trek from Pfoho to Mather, tell yourself you’ve journeyed from the Winterfell to Riverrun to add some adventure to the monotony of a far-from-mild March. If you don’t care for new-fangled television fads, cast your mind back to your childhood and enter the wondrous world you first encountered reading “The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.” The weather wasn’t so hot there either, pun absolutely intended. Better yet, play Elsa in Disney’s “Frozen” and belt out “Let It Go” until you’re really convinced that the cold never bothered you anyway. (“Let It Go” is different than “Let Her Go.” Both make me cry.) Pretend you’re in Westeros, in Narnia, or in Arendelle.
 Or anywhere. Anywhere but here. Please, God, anywhere but here.

Left or right? For many, finding a restroom is as easy as following a stick figure.
But for some transgender and gender-variant people, picking a restroom can be a daily dilemma. A trans man who is frequently mistaken for female might be caught between compromising his dignity by entering a women’s room and risking hostility from other men who feel that he doesn’t belong in a men’s room. Some people take their chances and enter public restrooms anyway. Others opt to “hold it,” risking serious health problems as a result.
With only men’s and women’s restrooms, the Harvard Law School campus currently forces these challenges on some of its students and guests, and remains a prohibitively hostile environment for others. Gender-neutral bathrooms, also known as unisex or all-gender bathrooms, can provide a much-needed alternative.
Dean of Students Ellen Cosgrove and other Law School administrators have been willing to consider offering GNBs on campus. They’ve provided my fellow GNB proponents and me with useful information and input, and we deeply appreciate their involvement. Before moving forward with the upgrade, however, they have asked us to demonstrate student support.
An upcoming Student Representative Board referendum will therefore gauge interest in a range of potential restroom changes. We urge our fellow students to vote in favor of upgrading three types of facilities: all single-occupancy restrooms, some dorm communal restrooms, and one multi-stall restroom on each academic building floor that lacks single-occupancy facilities (including, for instance, roughly four of the 18 multi-stall restrooms in Wasserstein Hall), with the partitions between stalls enhanced for greater privacy and security. 
We are grateful to the many HLS student organizations that have either endorsed this initiative or cosponsored events related to it, including Advocates for Human Rights, American Civil Liberties Union, American Constitutional Society, Black Law Students Association, Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review, Democrats, Law and Policy Review, Reproductive Justice, Journal of Law and Gender, Lambda, Prison Legal Assistance Project, South Asian Law Students Association, and Women's Law Association. Among the many reasons for this support, we highlight a few.
By diminishing the day-to-day salience of gender and reducing opportunities for us to police each other’s adherence to gender norms, GNBs stand to benefit everyone. Parents could accompany opposite-sex children into public restrooms without hesitation. There would be more private spaces available in which to breastfeed infants. People using wheelchairs, recovering from injuries, or otherwise facing mobility restrictions wouldn’t have to go out of their way to find open restrooms as often. And women could use GNBs to avoid the relatively long lines at existing women’s restrooms.
With widely available GNBs, HLS could also attract more diverse students, staff, faculty, and guests. Janet Halley, the Royall Professor of Law at HLS, noted via email that the lack of GNBs has already “put several of my trans outside-speaker and co-teacher guests through unnecessary stress.” Meanwhile, universities with better accommodations can draw qualified students away from the Law School. “Over the coming years, more and more trans students will be admitted to the law school, and many of them will not enroll when they see our bathrooms,” Professor Halley said. “Why should they [have to] make that their central issue while they are students here?”
Thanks in part to irresponsible rhetoric around other GNB efforts, some of our fellow students may fear that GNBs enable sexual violence. Though well intentioned, this objection is by all appearances unfounded, and obscures the real and painful history of transgender people as frequent victims of abuse. Harvard’s own Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response supports GNBs.
“There is no research to suggest that incidents of sexual violence in restrooms increase with the availability of gender neutral bathrooms,” OSAPR Director Alicia Oeser noted. “In fact, research suggests trans* and gender nonconforming individuals consistently report that their safety is increased by making gender neutral bathrooms available.”
Another common concern is that international students might be especially uncomfortable using GNBs. To some extent, this assertion relies on the incorrect assumption that alternatives to heterosexist and gender-binary-based institutions are uniquely Western or Anglo-derived concepts. Still, we acknowledge that some religious and cultural traditions emphasize separation of men and women. In addition, sharing restroom space with people of other genders might trigger severe stress for some survivors of sexual violence. In light of these concerns, we emphasize that the proposed upgrade would affect a minority of restrooms—men’s and women’s rooms would remain readily available throughout the campus.
Adding GNBs into the mix of Law School accommodations will strengthen our scholarly community and create a more hospitable environment for our project of understanding and improving the law. To learn more, and to voice any questions, concerns, or support, please stop by the GNB petition-signing and information table during lunch over the next two weeks in Caspersen.

Earlier this week, Harvard Business School announced that it would launch HBX, a venture designed to provide online courses offered by a world-renowned institution. The “X” in the acronym makes a partial reference to edX, another online endeavor by the University to offer a series of massively open online courses in partnership with several other universities, including MIT. HBX and edX plan on being “deeply interwoven” with each other, and we have praised edX in the past for opening the door to higher education and making such courseware available to the public. HBX differs from its counterpart in its selectivity and premium price—neither of which characterize edX. Nonetheless, it fits the broader spirit of using modern technology to share a Harvard education beyond Cambridge.
 
Joining HBX requires more than just redirecting to a given URL—according to the Boston Globe, enrollment in the first term of HBX’s “CORe,” or “Credential of Readiness,” will require individuals to go through a selective application process as well as submit $1500 in payment upon matriculation. While these fees and applications may seem to contradict the philanthropic nature of edX, they will aid the financial stability of Harvard’s ventures in online education. When edX was launched in 2012, $60 million in combined funding from Harvard and MIT helped kick-start the program. This money, however, can only carry edX so far until it must become financially independent. EdX’s very own CEO, Anant Agarwal, confirmed that the platform is planning on becoming self-sustaining within a few years, after initial funds have run dry.
 
All else equal, of course, free or low-cost education is preferable to $1500 price tags. But even though edX is a non-profit organization, it still must break even in its costs. A similar project—AllLearn by Stanford, Oxford, and Yale—closed under financial duress in 2006, and Columbia University’s Fathom shut down for the same reasons in 2003. Harvard is rightly motivated to ensure its projects avoid that fate, as is evident in the choice of Wendy Cebula, an accomplished businesswoman, for edX’s new COO on Monday.
 Some might view the recent launch of HBX as pointing to an identity crisis, with edX split between altruistic and cost-conscious sides. But we see edX much like we would a startup, finding entrepreneurial ways to adapt and generate necessary revenue while still keeping itself applicable to many users. HBX doesn’t introduce barriers to existing content. Instead, with the addition of HBX, the Harvard platform online expands its range of both public and premium services. That platform has a variety of goals from experimentation to affordability, but above all, Harvard’s online forays aim to deliver a high-quality education to more people than Harvard’s non-virtual classrooms can seat. With its emphasis on preserving quality and its eye for sustainability, HBX promises to accomplish that.

Leaders from the higher education, healthcare, and biotech sectors gathered Thursday to discuss the best practices for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting energy efficiency in labs around the region.
Sponsored by the Boston Green Ribbon Commission, the power company NSTAR, and National Grid electricity and gas companies, the day-long symposium served as an opportunity to help Massachusetts meet its climate goals and promoting resource conservation in labs.
Mariella Puerto, a senior program officer at the Barr Foundation, which sponsors the Green Ribbon Commission, said that the company hopes to help the state of Massachusetts reach its greenhouse gases goals. The Global Warming Solutions Act of 2008 mandates that the state reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent by 2020 and 80 percent by 2050.
Allen Aloise, the director of laboratories and co-director of graduate studies in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, gave one of three keynote speeches, in which he addressed the importance of educating today’s students about how important energy-efficient facilities will be in the future.
“If we don’t give them this information, who will?” Aloise said in an interview after the symposium. “One of the things that came across is that Harvard is very much a leader on this issue…embracing sustainability and energy efficiency.”
The symposium included a networking session, workshops, and a case study of the Smart Labs Initiative at the University of California Irvine.
Heather A. Henriksen, the director of the Office for Sustainability said that the goal of the event was to harness the intelligence and knowledge of energy and environmental leaders and to reach out to those who have had success in the field. 
According to Henriksen, the symposium brought together relevant energy-related groups in order to brainstorm ways to make laboratories safe, sustainable, energy efficient, and ready for researchers to facilitate discovery.
Henriksen said that some strategies to reduce greenhouse emissions that stood out at the symposium were improved lab design, modified fume hoods, new and energy-efficient lab equipment, and behavioral education that informs students and professional researchers of the importance of energy-saving practices.
The symposium also served to address Harvard’s 10-year goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2016, even accounting for growth in the size of the University.

Zaid Al–Ali, a senior adviser at the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, said that an increase in large-scale corruption in Iraq has led to severe human rights abuses and violence in the country during a book talk at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies on Thursday.
A constitutional lawyer, Al-Ali is the author of “The Struggle for Iraq’s Future: How Corruption, Incompetence and Sectarianism Have Undermined Democracy.”  During the event, he focused on the process by which a new constitution was created in Iraq and the effects it has had on the country since.
Al-Ali said the constitution has very few provisions or specific regulations, which allows the current political elites to “create rules as they go, leaving the country to the devices of the politicians.”
Al-Ali, who has advocated for climate change action in Iraq, also talked about the government’s response to environmental disasters in the country. He contributed the lack of government legitimacy in Iraq in part to its response to the increase in temperatures and dust storms throughout the country.
The senior adviser also presented a graph to the audience showing electricity demand and production in Iraq, pointing out the large gap between the two.
“While the temperature increases dramatically in the summers, the electricity production does not, leading to riots and the burning of government buildings during severe heat waves,” he said.
Al-Ali then discussed the issue of dust storms and showed the audience pictures he had taken himself of an orange sky after a storm. According to Al-Ali, these storms can be harmful to physical health and hurt a country economically by shutting down schools, stores, and even the airport for days at a time.
Al-Ali concluded the presentation by arguing that, moving forward, Iraq needs to impose more comprehensive political reforms and address climate change issues by encouraging a revitalization of the agricultural sector.
Audience members said they appreciated hearing about the state of Iraq and the struggles it is facing, particularly from the perspective of someone from the country.
Amal Kabalan, a student at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, said she came to the event “to get the perspective of an insider regarding what’s happening in Iraq” and a constitutional lawyer’s perspective on the country’s new constitution.

After many months of anticipation, 1,031 high school students around the world today received the news for which thousands more had been hoping. But these Harvard admits were not the only ones with reason to celebrate “decision day.” For the members of Harvard’s Office of Admissions and Financial Aid, the day marked the end of months of application reviews and committee meetings that went into producing the Class of 2018.
More than a dozen members of the office met around noon to make the final preparations to mail out admissions packets.
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said that he can remember the years when he towed all the decision letters in his car to the post office for mailing. But as the number of applicants has increased, so has the number of staff members who have helped with the process and the mailings.
On Thursday, “Don’t Stop Believing” and “Eye of the Tiger” could be heard playing throughout a hall filled with staffers sealing envelopes, ready to be put aboard a mail truck and delivered to admitted students early next week.
Around noon, with photographers in place, the staff formed a human assembly line from within the office out to a waiting mail truck. Inside, a late breakfast of pancakes, coffee, and well-mixed mimosas awaited the celebratory staff.
And, staff members said, planning for the Class of 2019 is well underway.

The total cost of attendance for Harvard College will increase next year by the largest percentage in seven years, the University announced Thursday. The $2,200 hike, which represents a 3.9 percent increase, brings the total cost of tuition, room, board, and other fees to $58,607 for the 2014-2015 school year.
The cost of attending Harvard for students not receiving need-based financial aid continues to outpace inflation, which was most recently estimated at 1.1 percent, according to the Bureau for Labor Statistics.
This higher price tag will be paid by less than about half of all students, however, as the College continues to offer financial aid through the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative, which is in its 10th year.
The Initiative was launched by former University President Lawrence H. Summers to increase financial support for students from lower and middle-class backgrounds.
Nearly 60 percent of the Class of 2018 is projected to receive need-based financial aid grants during their freshman year, contributing an average of about $12,000. The College requires no contribution from families earning annual incomes  less than $65,000—a demographic comprising about 20 percent of Harvard families. For the majority of families receiving financial aid, Harvard asks for an average of about 10 percent of the family’s income.
Financial aid is the largest priority of the recently launched $2.5 billion capital campaign for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, with the goal set at $600 million. Last month, hedge fund manager Kenneth C. Griffin ’89 gave at least $125 million for financial aid as part of the largest single donation in the College’s history.
Neither Dean of Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith nor FAS Dean of Administration and Finance Leslie A. Kirwan ’79 was available for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Klaus M. Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, shared his insights on the challenges faced by today’s global economy at the Institute of Politics Thursday evening.
The discussion, titled “Improving the State of the World”, was moderated by David R. Gergen, co-director of the Center for Public Leadership at the Kennedy School of Government.
Sharing his opinions on the world economy, Schwab emphasized the importance of innovation to a country’s economic competitiveness.
“Today we should talk about not developed and developing countries, but rather high-innovation and low-innovation countries,” Schwab said. “Traditional comparative advantages will play a lesser role. It is the ability to innovate that will determine a country’s economic success.”
For Schwab, innovation means not just “providing new goods and services,” but also equipping “people with the new necessary skills.”
 
When asked how to build a better capitalist world, Schwab said: “I argue that we’ve moved from capitalism to talentism: the most decisive factor of production today is human capital and talent. The key challenge we face today is how to make sure that everyone can become a talent and has the necessary skills.”
 
Another challenge that Schwab highlighted was the tension between national and global governance.
“The world today is becoming increasingly interconnected, but the governance system has become more and more disconnected,” Schwab said. “There is a tendency today where national interests prevail over global interests. We must have a global interest in mind for everything we’re doing.”
Much of Schwab’s work has centered on empowering and enabling young people.
Born in Germany and educated in Switzerland, Schwab spent a year at Harvard in 1967 and holds a  Master’s Degree of Public Administration from the Kennedy School. By age 31, Schwab had acquired five degrees and founded the World Economic Forum, which describes itself as “the world’s foremost multi-stakeholder organization”.
Schwab called his education at the Kennedy School “a life changing experience” that made him decide to “devote my life to public service.”
Many audience members were part of the Forum of Young Global Leaders or the Global Shapers Community, two organizations founded by Schwab that focus on amplifying the impact of young leaders in shaping the world today.
Kate B. Aitken, a joint-degree candidate at the Business School and the Kennedy School, is a Global Shaper working to catalyze innovation in the civic sector in Boston.
 
“It’s thrilling to hear him talk about how optimistic he is about the role we play as a generation,” she said.
Deng Majok Chol, a South Sudanese student at the Kennedy School, echoed the sentiment.
 “He talked about the the challenges of governance that we are facing today and how [international organizations] help young countries like South Sudan to attend to the tremendous challenges of nation-building,” Chol said. “That was something that I could relate with.”

As the clock approached 5 p.m. on Thursday, Flavia Cuervo began to dread checking her email’s inbox.
“I got the email, and I still didn’t want to open it,” said Cuervo, who is a senior at Miami Lakes Educational Center in Florida. “But my mom kept asking me to and everyone was yelling at me.”
Cuervo turned out to be one of 1,031 students admitted via regular decision to Harvard’s Class of 2018. She and her fellow regular-decision admittees join the 992 students admitted under early action in the fall, comprising a total admitted class of 2,023.
To relieve stress from waiting for the College’s decision email, Cuervo, who was on spring break, said she bought ice cream and went shopping for prom dresses before hearing of her admittance.
Other students on spring break this week faced the task of distracting themselves before decisions were released.
Jacqueline D. Goodman, a student at Horace Mann School in New York, said she spent the week watching “Game of Thrones” in order to keep her mind off her anxiety. According to Goodman, that anxiety was only heightened when she tried to sign into Harvard’s admitted student’s web portal and the page would not load.
Goodman said she had almost given up on checking the portal when it loaded and that her admission was a “great surprise.”
“It was so bizarre,” she said, recalling the moment she learned of her acceptance. “It’s like you almost aren't reading that ‘Congratulations.’ It was an out-of-body experience.”
Some admitted students said that they purposefully tried to forget about their applications after they submitted them in January.
“I kind of adopted a zen approach,” said Henry D. Shreffler of Brookline, Mass. “I realized once I hit submit on the Common App and once I did my interview, there was nothing I could do to change things.”
Karen M. Maldonado of Houston, Texas, said that she also tried not to give much thought to the decision she would be receiving nearly three months after she submitted her application.
“To be honest, the type of person I am, I really did not give much thought to it,” she said. “I tried to disconnect myself from it because it was a very real possibility that I would not get in.”
When she did receive her acceptance email, Maldonado said that she started jumping up and down with her parents and that the news spread fast among her friends.
Maldonado and other students said they are excited to attend Visitas, Harvard’s visiting weekend for prospective students, slated for the last weekend of April.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 100 workers, advocates, and students launched a boycott of the Boston-Cambridge DoubleTree Suites by Hilton Hotel on Thursday evening to support DoubleTree employees in their efforts to unionize.
The boycott comes after a majority of workers at the hotel signed a petition last March to launch the process of deciding whether to join UNITE HERE! Local 26, a Massachusetts-based union that represents Harvard’s dining hall employees. The protesting workers hope that Hilton will be more receptive to their preferred means of unionization if Harvard pressures them. The hotel is not operated by the University but is located in a Harvard-owned building.
“We need the hotel and Harvard to listen to us and...we think a boycott will make them listen to what we need,” said Sandra Hernandez, a DoubleTree employee of 22 years, who spoke through a translator at the rally.
The rally attracted four Cambridge City Council members and dozens Harvard students, according to Gabriel H. Bayard '15. They gathered at the John Harvard statue and marched together to the Doubletree to join the rally. DoubleTree workers and advocates will ask prospective guests not to eat, sleep, or meet at their hotel, according to a press release by UNITE HERE! Local 26.
The boycott has earned the support of the Harvard Undergraduate Council and Harvard Graduate School Council. However, Harvard's director of labor relations, Bill Murphy, said in a statement on Thursday that the University maintains that the issue should be resolved between the union and the employer, in this instance UNITE HERE! Local 26 and Hilton.
“The University will support any fair process for unionization that is agreed upon between Hilton and Local 26,” Murphy said.
The issue arises because there are two different ways workers can unionize. The traditional way involves a National Labor Relations Board election in which a union will be formed if 50 percent of workers cast ballots in favor of unionization. The other way, which is preferred by the protesting DoubleTree workers, is a fair process vote in which workers can sign a card at any time that allows a union to be formed, which requires the consent of the employer.
According to a Hilton Worldwide spokesperson, the company does not believe that a true majority of Doubletree workers wish to be represented by any union for the purposes of collective bargaining.
“The appropriate and fairest process for determining whether a majority of employees wish to be represented is through a secret ballot election conducted by the National Labor Relations Board,” the Hilton spokesperson said in a statement on Wednesday.
Supporters of the fair process think otherwise.
“All campus workers are guaranteed a fair process—this has been an established tradition at Harvard,” said Blake A. McGhghy ’17, a Student Labor Action Movement member who attended the boycott rally. McGhghy said that Harvard plays a “crucial role” in the issue because it is the primary owner of the building that contains the hotel and makes $20 million per year from the hotel.
Anastacia M. Valdespino ’17, another SLAM member who picketed outside the DoubleTree Thursday afternoon, said that because DoubleTree administrators can choose the date of an NLRB election, there is a risk that that they would schedule the election so that many workers would not be able to participate.
“I think the boycott will be successful in getting Harvard to see that they definitely have an accountability to this issue,” Valdespino said. “As an investor in this hotel, ideally this should open Harvard’s eyes to put some pressure on the DoubleTree and to get the fair process going.”

More than 20 members of the Harvard Teaching Campaign, all teaching fellows from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, gathered Thursday evening to determine the next steps for their movement to improve the undergraduate educational experience. The group has spent most its effort in the past month circulating a petition calling for a limit to undergraduate section sizes.
Thursday’s meeting was the campaign’s third in a month and ended with members agreeing on a short-term plan of action. That plan focuses on expanding outreach to new segments of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences community in order to gain more signatures on the petition, which has accumulated several hundred so far.
The petition has also garnered endorsements from the faculty of the Philosophy Department, the Undergraduate Council, graduate students in the History Department, as well as limited support from the History Department faculty.
Much of the meeting’s discussion centered on the need to reach out to undergraduates and their parents, as well as alumni, in order to broaden the campaign’s audience and to convey a sense of urgency to administrators.
Members also discussed the campaign’s future relationship with the Undergraduate Council, which endorsed the campaign’s petition Sunday. In the wake of the vote, campaign participants said they plan to meet with the UC’s Education Committee with the goal of better communicating their efforts to undergraduates through the House system.
Group members also plan to look into the possibility of using Harvard’s alumni network and Harvard Clubs, located in most major cities and states, to increase visibility among alumni, the University’s financial base.
As they look to raise the campaign’s profile among Harvard affiliates, group members also plan to refine their approach and goals.
Specifically, some members aim to better understand the exact decision-making process that determines section sizes. Though representatives of the group have already met with Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris, others said the group aims to further its understanding of the administrative network that must convinced of its goals.
Though they agreed on a plan of action, campaign members shared a wide range of views throughout the meeting, offering differing perspectives on the scope of group’s responsibilities and goals.
One member, a fifth-year graduate student, said that it is the administration’s job to find solutions to the issues standing in the way of limiting section sizes.
“The burden is not on us,” the graduate student said, adding that it was not the group’s responsibility to provide a “blueprint” to the University.
Another member said that although a plan of execution might be the administration’s responsibility, the group should not expect administrators to actually take on the task without pressure and ideas from the Harvard Teaching Campaign.
In order to inform these ideas, the group plans to look into section sizes at peer institutions and how they are determined.
Some members also expressed concerns that their group was not fully representative of disciplinary diversity, given the absence of any graduate students in the hard sciences. Sections in these disciplines might face other difficulties, such as lab safety concerns, said one member, and their teaching fellows might have other thoughts on the ideal section size.

Despite its small size, the Committee on Degrees in Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality has seen an increase in non-concentrators taking its courses over the last several years, published enrollment statistics show.
U.S. in the World 26: “Sex and the Citizen: Race, Gender, and Belonging in the United States,” can be taken for a General Education requirement and has seen a nearly eight-fold increase in enrollment since it was first offered in 2010, with a class size just shy of 200.
In addition, WOMGEN 1168: “Education, Race, and Gender in the United States” now has over 110 students enrolled in the course. Despite the high enrollment of these two WGS courses, there are only 37 WGS concentrators total in the College.
Caroline Light, the department’s director of undergraduate studies, said that the decision to introduce a WGS General Education class in 2008 was crucial to the increase in popularity of the department’s courses.
“The Gen Ed class has been tremendously helpful in bringing critical and analytical skills of gender studies to the student body,” she said.
Light added that she enjoys teaching students from a diverse array of disciplines in the course.
“It’s such an incredibly rich community with people from first-years to seniors and also people from concentrations like engineering as well,” she said.
Talia Weisberg ’17, a freshman and prospective WGS concentrator, has taken two WGS classes since she came in the fall. She said that having a wide variety of students in her classes added to the experience.
“Having so many types of concentrators brings a different set of knowledge and set of academic tools to the conversation,” she said.
Light also said that teaching the course has refined her teaching skills.
“In a WGS elective course, you can take for granted certain shared vocabulary,” she said. “I’ve found as a teacher you have to become much more fluid for applications of theory into teaching. I have to be a much better communicator and not take for granted jargony terms.”
Medha Gargeya ’14, a government concentrator, decided in her sophomore year to take the class WOMGEN 1231: “American Social Bodies” with WGS lecturer Keridwen Luis “on a whim.”
“As a gov concentrator, I knew a lot about how institutions and the law shape how people interact, but I never thought about how people had to deal with what the law and institutions had to do to them,” she said. “I really found it very beneficial. It was gratifying for me because I was able to match my legal interests with the new gender theory I was learning.”
The course, she said, inspired her senior thesis, which was on the use of social science in sex discrimination decisions in the U.S. Supreme Court.
“That class gave me a broad historical overview of what women’s work looks like and what sex discrimination looks like,” she said. “It gave me a framework for how to approach the topic.”
She credits the department’s teaching staff with the increasing popularity of WGS courses.
“They’re so well-taught and the professors are fantastic,” she said.

Speaking before a crowded room in Harvard Law School’s Austin Hall, online journalist Andrew Sullivan discussed how the rise of sponsored content in journalism has begun to erode the foundation of the Fourth Estate.
 
While the talk was titled “How Advertising Defeated Journalism,” Sullivan focused his criticism on sponsored content, which he defined as a piece in a magazine or newspaper that “looks almost identical to every other article in the magazine, but in fact is written by a copy-writer, hired by a corporation.” Sponsored content, he argued, endangers “the entire enterprise of writing.”
 
“You think you’re reading a writer when you’re actually reading a copy-writer,” said Sullivan, particularly singling out Buzzfeed as a prime example of what he considers problematic.
 
Sullivan, who founded the online journalism website The Dish also heavily criticized more traditional media outlets, including The New York Times, The Associated Press, The Atlantic, and many other publications for participating in the trend, and even worse, for failing to apologize for it.
 
“There is a conspiracy of silence in the media about the media’s own silence,” said Sullivan, pointing to a situation when The Atlantic ran a sponsored article by the Church of Scientology and the “business-side of the magazine,” rather than any editorial representatives, apologized for the uproar that ensued, while also censoring the comments that appeared on its site.
 
“Does it matter whether any of this stuff is actually related to the truth? Of course not. The truth is a peripheral matter,” Sullivan said. 
Sullivan blamed the proliferation of sponsored content on the rise of the Internet and the resulting diffusion of advertising revenue and collapse of the subscription model.
Internet pageviews traditionally drive advertising revenue, but as total pageviews increased, the advertisers’ impact was “inevitably diffused,” he said.
“So along comes this amazing thing called ‘sponsored content,’” he said.
Sullivan said he believed that the increasing popularity of sponsored content would eventually lead to widespread reader cynicism and an eventual reduction of the effectiveness in sponsored content.
“After a while, in this circus of desperate attempts to get attention…there will be a moment in which the average reader will look at The New York Times and be so disgusted by what it’s become,” he said, adding that he wanted his journalism company, The Dish, “to be there when that happens.”
Sullivan characterized The Dish, which uses a yearly subscription model and currently has 28,000 members, as an alternative path for journalism.
 
However, Caroline O’Donovan, an audience member and staff writer at the Nieman Journalism Lab, asked Sullivan whether his model could work for journalists who lack the prominence he had when he launched The Dish. 
In response, Sullivan said it had taken him 14 years to reach the point he was at now. “If we can get 28,000 subscribers, why can’t anyone else?” he asked. “Why are they so afraid?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Continuing recent campus discussion about race, undergraduate leaders from both the black and Latino communities have come together for a conversation about race relations and institutional support for students of color at Harvard.
Thursday evening, students of color held a town hall meeting in Pforzheimer House. According to Edward Escalon ’14, who attended the meeting, students at the town hall discussed topics including race relations in the Houses, funding and institutional support for student organizations and cultural groups, and the impact of the freshman orientation program “Community Conversations.”
It was good to see students from the Latino and black communities, as well students of Asian descent, “come together” and discuss the issues, Escalon said in an interview Thursday evening following the town hall, which was not open to the press.
The discussion in Pforzheimer comes several weeks after a social media campaign and theater production highlighting black students’ experiences on campus, called “I, Too, Am Harvard,” caught national attention, and student members of the Latino community held a town hall discussion event. At the town hall, held March 6, some students expressed frustration with what they characterized as a lack of institutional support for Latino students at Harvard.
Herbert B. Castillo ’14, one of the organizers for the Latino town hall meeting earlier this month, said that immediately following that meeting, Latino student leaders formed a task force open to all students that were in attendance at the town hall.
According to Sarah F. Cole ’16, a similar discussion grew independently within the black community. Just weeks after a Harvard Black Students Association event that drew almost 200 attendees, black student leaders on campus gathered on Feb. 16 to discuss various problems facing the black community. Members of the black community continued to meet weekly on these issues.
“We were advocating for the same demand,” Castillo said. “We had not the same but very, very similar experiences.” Escalon similarly said that “we saw that our struggles were similar to the struggles of black students” on campus.
According to Castillo, the Latino and black student leaders ultimately decided to combine their efforts and hold Thursday’s town hall meeting, open to all racial and cultural minorities, for discussion on the issues of faculty and staff diversity, programming and policy, and resources at Harvard.
“It was empowering to hear a lot of the stories regarding these three categories,” Castillo said. “I’m really excited about the prospect of moving forward and turning these conversations into concrete solutions in the three categories.”
“Everyone is incredibly excited by this opportunity to come together as a community and show the power of our united voice,” Cole wrote in an email. “We look forward to what lies ahead."
Escalon, for his part, suggested that administrators should respond to the discussion about Harvard’s support for students of color. A number of students have argued that University funding is not enough to sufficiently support student cultural groups, and others have called for the creation of a Latino studies program, for example.
“It’s time for the administration to listen to its students,” Escalon said. “It’s time for the University to listen and to take action.”
Neurology professor S. Allen Counter, director of the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, joined the group at the end of the meeting to show his support for the conversation.
“That’s why I’m here tonight with the students,” Counter said. “To say, ‘I support you and your aspirations and your initiatives, and please, count on not only the Foundation’s support, but my personal support of your interests.’”

Happy Friday! As of today, there are 1,031 new members of the Harvard community. In addition to the 992 admitted under early action, it looks like the Class of 2018 is shaping up to be a pretty solid crew. Welcome, prefrosh!
As you inevitably spend the next few weeks learning everything you can about the schools you got into, make sure you do your homework on Harvard (that’s right, homework before you even get here). Become a newfound lover of the Crimson (bonus points if you become a newfound lover of Flyby), read up on Harvard’s housing system (or at least Harvard’s housing videos), and learn about our Dean (interim Dean, but that’s okay). Or, if you already know you’re coming here, get started on the reading for the courses you’ve already decided you’ll be taking next year. Let’s be real, you probably already have. Enjoy that enthusiasm and dedication while it lasts, prefrosh. Seriously.
IN THE ATMOSPHEREToday’s high of 58 degrees is super exciting...until you see that it’s raining. But hey, can’t have everything right? Saturday’s weather will be pretty similar, while Sunday will dip to the 30s. One day spring will come. I hope.

 Congratulations, Class of 2018!! Whether you found out in December that you’ll be wearing Crimson next year or you just got the news yesterday, we welcome you the Harvard community (or at least congratulate you on having the opportunity to join it). The next step is deciding whether or not Harvard is the place for you. We’re not going to lie, Harvard isn’t perfect, but there's definitely more you should know about it than what the Admissions Office can convey to you.
 
 To clear this up right off the bat, there is a social life at Harvard. Sure, this isn’t a “party school” and sports games aren’t the center of everyone’s weekend like at some universities (though Harvard-Yale gets pretty exciting). Most people here are really social and engaging, so don't worry that the campus will seem empty on Friday and Saturday nights with everyone locked away in the library. Whether it’s with a group of close friends, a sports team, or an extracurricular activity, there are always things to do on campus and interesting people who want to hang out.
 That being said, work here is hard. You may have heard some nonsense about grade inflation and everyone getting an A- or above. If a large number of students here get good grades it's usually because a large number of students here work their asses off. This is a good thing, though, because you will surprise yourself with how much work you can get done at a high level. You'll soon feel much more comfortable reading (or pretending to have read) multiple books a week, participating in classes, and writing 8 pages essays in record time. The work is hard, but you really do learn a lot.
Frozen yogurt at lunch and dinner. Two flavors. Every. Day. There’s also rarely not an opportunity to eat free pizza.
 Everyone here is smarter than you. Obviously that’s not actually true, but it is true that everyone here is very smart and that you will probably feel overwhelmed by the kinds of things your peers have done before even getting here (“You discovered a cure for what?!”). But wait until you need to come up with a last minute idea for a presentation, or do a group project, and you'll be thankful for so many great minds. Your classmates can be great resources and actually help you learn and grow as a student.
Last one. Did you ever hear that “stuck up Harvard kid” stereotype? Hint: It’s not true. At least not any more true than at other schools. Sure, you’ll meet a few of these pretentious kids at Visitas (or maybe they’re already posting in your Facebook group…), but don’t let that deter you.
This list isn’t exhaustive, but hopefully it clears up a few things you have rattling around your brains before you decide whether or not Harvard is the place for you. You can expect the work to be hard and your peers to be little Einsteins, but don’t expect Harvard to be dull, boring, or uninviting.

Congratulations on your acceptances, Class of 2018! As you may already know, one of the main privileges of getting into Harvard is getting to use the 2018 class Facebook page. Here’s some advice on how to get ahead of the curve and become a celebrity on campus without ever leaving your bedroom.
Your Standardized Test Scores and GPAWhy be subtle in your pursuit to let everyone know how smart you are? There’s no better way to make friends than shamelessly posting your SAT, ACT, and GPA on the 2018 page. For added bonus points, also post SAT II, AP, IB, IQ, A-Level, and placement test scores!
All of Your Other College AcceptancesThe more modest way of doing this is to ask the group to help you come up with pros and cons of attending Harvard instead of Yale, Princeton, Stanford, MIT, Cal Tech, Wharton, and all the other Ivies you got into. But why be humble? Posting the whole list of your acceptances will help you make friends because everyone obviously likes confident, successful people.
Let Everyone How Much You Are Slacking and PartyingThe flip side of aggressively letting everyone know what a genius you are is aggressively letting everyone know how much of a second semester senior you have become. This is a good strategy because nothing shows you are chill like posting three times a day in order to make friends with people you have never met.
SelfiesThey say a picture is worth a thousands words. Pictures are also great ways of showing your future classmates how smokin’ hot you are! For added selfie awesomeness try taking a picture while you are “getting swole” at the gym or out partying! This is a great, totally not awkward, way of getting acquainted with your new classmates.
Overly Personal Stories or Information About YourselfYou can feel comfortable sharing the deepest, darkest secrets of your life that you wouldn’t even share with your best friends in high school because you can trust your 1,600 new best friends. You may not know them all yet, but that certainly shouldn't stop you for being overly comfortable sharing personal information on the internet. What could possibly go wrong?
Declare Your Candidacy for President… of the United StatesIt’s never too early to kick off your campaign! You got into Harvard, so you're obviously the chosen one, right? Flatly announcing your candidacy for the 2036, 2040, or 2044 election is a great way to let your classmates know you are a social juggernaut who will soon sit atop the national and (more importantly) campus hierarchy.
Uninteresting Things You Are Currently DoingNot everything has to be as deep. Sometimes people need a refreshing “I am watching Breaking Bad on Netflix, you guys.” To be extra cool and hipster do something non-mainstream, like going to Starbucks.
The Video of Your Valedictorian SpeechThis is a fun and not-at-all egocentric way of letting everyone know what a deep and thoughtful person you are. Your classmates will really absorb the insights you are sharing with them. You can also get more YouTube views. It’s a win-win situation you can create by posting effectively!
Totally Random Things You Found on the InternetNo one will be annoyed by the endless notifications they get when you do this. In fact, all 1,600 of your new friends are probably psyched to watch that 20 minute vine compilation you just watched! For extra fun try posting CAT BOUNCE! because it serves literally no purpose at all, and people will appreciate that.
This ArticleFinally, post this article right now. Someone else posted it already? Post it again! You want to show people you know what’s going on around campus even though you’re a prefrosh. When you post this article you show you’re in the loop, you have a sense of humor, and I get to be on The Crimson’s most read articles! Everyone wins!
Congratulations, Harvard Class of 2018! At last, the wait is over: the long nights of tweaking your Common App essay, the nervous weeks leading up to today, the anticipation as you constantly refreshed your inbox, and the spark of both excitement and dread that made your stomach jump the moment the email actually appears.
Amidst the excited yells, the hugs and congratulations, you'll find yourself thinking about your life here at Harvard. Maybe you're looking forward to "pahking yah cah in Hahvahd Yahd" as you arrive to move in to your new home and meet all the other freshmen just like you. You'll all be curious, perhaps a little scared, but excited to be starting a new chapter of your life at such a beautiful, historic, and prestigious place.
Maybe you're looking forward to late night conversations about aldol condensations and the latest posts on your favorite tumblr blogs, debates about the merits of capitalism and whether Berryline is better than Pinkberry, or even the constant searches for people who share your interests, intellectual and otherwise.
Perhaps you can't wait to meet all your professors, inviting them to dinners or being invited into their homes for dinners instead. You'll spend hours discussing the newest scientific article that really caught your attention and work with them on projects you both are passionate about. You'll come in to talk to them about your passion for a subject you never knew you even liked.
Maybe you'll explore and see all Harvard has to offer. You'll wander through the Harvard libraries, discovering hidden gems you never knew were there. You'll take a class on the History of Art and Architecture, intensive Russian, the Science of Cooking, Justice, Anton Chekhov, and even organic chemistry. You can't wait to see where your interests and passions take you.
Or maybe you'll make memories. Your first of four Harvard-Yale games—maybe even your first football game ever! The excitement and nervousness leading up to Housing Day, then the bliss of finding that your assigned House has really and truly become your home. Jammin' out at Yardfest to the tunes of Janelle Monae. Spending late nights in the Crimson or the radio station, just to hang out with your friends.
Whatever you're looking forward to, welcome to Harvard, Class of 2018. We can't wait to meet you.
