After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After three months on the market, Harvard Square properties housing businesses including Crema Cafe, Felipe’s Taqueria, Flat Patties, and Cardullo’s Gourmet Shoppe have been sold to Asana Partners for more than $100 million.
Asana Partners, a North Carolina-based real estate investment company, bought the properties for $108 million from the Dow and Stearns family trust, which has owned the real estate for a century, according to the Boston Globe. Purchased buildings include 1-8 Brattle, home to Cardullo’s Gourmet Shoppe, and 17-41A Brattle St., which hosts Felipe’s Taqueria, Crema Cafe, Flat Patties, and Rebekah Brooks Jewelry.
The properties have been up for sale since September 2017. In the months following the Dow and Stearns trust's decision to list the properties, some students and Harvard square residents said they feared the sale might cause Felipe's, Flat Patties, and Crema to leave the area. In particular, some locals said they worried large multinational firms might buy the properties, driving up rents for current businesses.
But Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said she thinks Felipe's, Flat Patties, and Crema are here to stay. She said Asana Partners spoke to the Business Association Monday afternoon and “expressed their desire to be here for a very long time.”
“It feels good, it feels comfortable,” Jillson said of the deal. “Having reached out to all of the tenants in the building a couple weeks ago, knowing that their intent was to protect the buildings, and then reaching out to the Business Association almost immediately before the ink was dry, makes us all feel very, very optimistic that they are in fact in for the long haul and will be engaged and responsible community partners.”
Thomas J. Brush, co-owner of Felipe’s, director of Flat Patties, and a partner in Crema Cafe, also said he remains hopeful for the future of his businesses.
“I don’t anticipate any problems with our continuing to stay here and being a part of the Harvard Square community for the near future,” Brush said. “We’ve been successful businesses that have been here in the Square, and I anticipate, whoever the new owners are, and whoever is managing the building, that they will continue to support and allow our businesses to stay here.”
Harvard professor and Harvard Square Neighborhood Association leader Suzanne P. Blier, though, said she felt less certain.
“It’s been long recognized that this property would be sold,” Blier said. “I think the comments on the outset are positive, at the same time, things change over the decades.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Calestous Juma, a Kenyan-born Harvard Kennedy School professor remembered for his contributions to the study of technology and innovation in Africa and for his “boisterous laugh,” died Friday due to prolonged health issues. He was 64.
Following Juma’s death, colleagues, academics around the world, and the presidents of two countries expressed their admiration, appreciation, and sympathies. Kenya’s president Uhuru Kenyatta and Rwanda’s president Paul Kagame both took to Twitter to lament Juma’s passing.
“I learned of the death of Professor Calestous Juma with profound dismay," Kenyatta tweeted Dec. 15. "We have lost one of our most distinguished scholars and patriots."
“We have lost a brilliant mind who was dedicated to innovation, education, and Africa’s prosperity,” Kagame tweeted the same day.
Juma was born on June 19, 1953, in Kenya. He demonstrated an early dedication to academics, attending what was then called Port Victoria Secondary School as one of its first students and later working as an elementary school teacher. He eventually earned degrees in science and technology policy, among other subjects, from the University of Sussex.
At the Kennedy School, he served as professor of the practice of international development as well as director of the science, technology, and globalization project at the Kennedy School's Belfer Center.
Archon Fung, the academic dean of the Kennedy School, said Juma was instrumental in harnessing the “enormous creativity and innovation and hope” present in various academic, political, and scientific communities throughout Africa.
“When we think of Africa and development, it’s very tempting to think of Africa as a basket case, and way behind many other parts of the world,” Fung said. “Reading Calestous and talking to Calestous, that’s not how he viewed it. Africa has different challenges to development but all of the resources and energy and community and spirit is there—and much of his professional life work was about building and amplifying that capacity."
Juma received international recognition for his scholarly work, winning the 2017 Breakthrough Paradigm Award and the 2014 Lifetime Africa Achievement Prize. He also earned induction into the United States National Academy of Sciences, the Royal Society of London, the World Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the African Academy of Sciences, among other honors.
Juma was also known for his international advising expertise, serving as the first executive secretary of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. He additionally worked as a consultant on public policy in Kenya and Finland and served as special advisor to the African Union, the United Nations, and the World Bank.
Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf said one of Juma’s outstanding characteristics was his tireless energy and “infectious enthusiasm.”
“He was never satisfied with what he had done,” Elmendorf said. “He was always looking for new ways to make the world better and that is a very powerful example for all of the faculty and students and staff at the Kennedy School.”
Juma continued to work while battling health difficulties in recent years, even publishing a 2016 book exploring the tensions between technological innovation and social policy.
“He’d be in the hospital and working on papers or revising the next edition of his book on African agricultural innovation,” Fung said. “I’d be stunned by how—even facing and dealing with these health challenges—how much energy and devotion he had.”
Beyond Juma’s professional achievements, many also commented on his extraordinary tenacity and warmth of spirit.
“If you’ve ever walked through our hallways and heard a boisterous laugh, that was Calestous,” Ash Carter, director of the Belfer Center, wrote in a public statement Friday.
“If you’ve ever seen a faculty member delighting in pick-up soccer along the shores of the Charles River, that was Calestous. If you’ve ever had your assumptions challenged and curiosity stoked all at once, that was Calestous,” Carter added.
Fung said that Juma “embodied the best spirit of the Kennedy School.”
“I think people don’t realize, even colleagues at the Kennedy School, how important and influential Calestous was in Africa,” Fung said. “Both among scholars and many people who were students, heads of state, ministers of science and technology and development, all looked to Calestous as an incredibly potent leading light. I think that’s really important for people to know, and I’m so glad he made his home at the Kennedy School to do that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Management Company has finalized its move to outsource its real estate management team to Boston-based private equity firm Bain Capital, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal.
HMC’s 22-person real estate management team, led by Daniel W. Cummings, will leave Harvard to form a new real estate unit at Bain effective February 2018, the Wall Street Journal reported. In the 2016 fiscal year, real estate assets comprised 14.5 percent of Harvard’s total endowment and gained 13.8 percent return on investment—higher than the yields in the University’s other assets classes including private equity, domestic bonds, or foreign equity.
The deal between Bain and HMC, which manages Harvard’s $37.1 billion endowment, had been anticipated for weeks—and the spin-out for months. In January, CEO N.P “Narv” Narvekar indicated in a letter accompanying Harvard’s annual financial report that he expected to reduce the size of HMC’s 230-person staff by half and spin out HMC’s real estate investments by the end of the calendar year.
In that letter, Narvekar described the endowment’s performance as “disappointing and not where it needs to be,” attributing some of its underperformance to structural problems with the portfolio.
Experts say the most recent Harvard-Bain move is consistent with Narvekar’s shift towards an external management system in which Harvard assets are handled by third-party investors. This strategy is similar to those employed by other Ivy League institutions such as Yale, whose endowment outpaced Harvard’s 8.1 percent endowment growth in fiscal year 2017. Harvard posted the lowest returns in the Ivy League.
“This deal is a natural way to pursue [Narvekar’s] strategy,” said Steven N. Kaplan ’81, a professor of finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. “This is very consistent with what Narv is trying to do, and seems to make a lot of sense.”
Charles A. Skorina, the leader of a financial executive search firm, said the deal was a “win-win,” allowing Harvard’s real estate team to potentially achieve more while enabling Bain Capital to enter a new field of investment in real estate.
“I think it is an excellent move, just brilliant,” Skorina said. “I think this is a win-win—this is good for the school, for Harvard Management Company, and for Bain.”
Other experts also saw the agreement as beneficial for Harvard. Brad R. Balter, a managing partner of Balter Capital Management, called it a “marquee move” for the University.
“As someone who generally reacts negatively to these deals, I was surprised—and I think that it’s a great deal,” Balter said. “And I don’t usually say that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 21 at 11:22 a.m.
Harvard will likely pay tens of millions annually in added federal taxes after congressional Republicans passed a $1.5 trillion tax bill Wednesday that included a tax on returns from large university endowments.
University President Drew G. Faust called the new endowment tax “unprecedented” in an emailed statement to The Crimson Wednesday, adding it will constrain the University’s finances and limit its capacity to fund certain programs.
“I am deeply concerned that the adoption of an unprecedented excise tax on charitable organizations that targets certain colleges and universities will weaken our ability to support students and research,” Faust wrote in the statement.
Faust and Harvard’s D.C.-based federal relations team have lobbied lawmakers to preserve the University’s tax-exempt status for years. Faust sent a public letter to members of Congress in April 2016 detailing how the University uses its endowment—now totaling $37.1 billion—to advance its educational mission. Over the course of several visits to Washington last winter and spring, Faust personally defended the tax-free endowment to lawmakers on Capitol Hill. And since Republicans unveiled their plan to overhaul the federal tax system in November, she said she mobilized alumni in red states and placed calls to lawmakers to urge Republicans to reconsider a provision taxing endowment returns.
Those pleas appear to have fallen on deaf ears. The final bill Congress passed Wednesday levies a 1.4 percent excise tax on the returns of university endowments that amount to more than $500,000 per student. Harvard falls into this category, and administrators estimated such a tax would have cost the University $43 million if it had taken effect during fiscal year 2017.
Faust specifically raised concerns Wednesday that the new tax will impact the University’s ability to fund financial aid programs.
“The provision will constrain the resources that enable us to provide the financial aid that makes college more affordable and accessible and to undertake the inquiries that yield discoveries, cures, innovation and economic growth,” Faust wrote.
In an interview in November, Faust called the endowment tax “a blow at the strength of American higher education” and said she was disappointed with Republican lawmakers she had viewed as allies.
[What exactly is the endowment, and how does it work? Read our explainer here.]
Tax law specialist Howard E. Abrams, a visiting professor at Harvard Law School, said he thinks provisions in the tax bill targeting colleges and universities stem from both a need to raise funds and, more broadly, from Republican disillusionment with higher education.
“They need all the revenue they can get,” Abrams said. “I think there are more people in the Republican party than in the Democratic party who believe that higher education is failing the public—that it’s full of liberals teaching things that are irrelevant to getting a job. So the value of higher education seems less significant to many Republicans than to many Democrats.”
The final version of the bill, a reconciliation of varying House and Senate versions passed across the past weeks, maintains current student loan interest deductions and tax exemptions for graduate student tuition waivers.
The student loan interest deduction—eliminated in the original House bill but included in the final version—allows students who borrow money to finance their education to file for tax deductions for the interest on those loans.
Another provision in the original House bill could have treated graduate students’ tuition waivers as taxable income—a proposal that generated alarm among graduate students at Harvard and around the country, many of whom raised concerns that the provision would render graduate school unaffordable. To the relief of students, that provision did not make it into the final bill.
The same provision that exempts the graduate student tuition waivers from taxation also applies to university employees who receive credits or waivers toward tuition for their children at their employing institution. The reconciled version of the bill protects the tax exemption on such financial benefits provided to employers, which Abrams said could have been one of the most financially burdensome aspects of the proposed legislation.
“I am glad to see adjustments in the tax bill, notably the preservation of tax-free tuition remission for graduate students and the student loan interest deduction which will enable undergraduate and graduate students to pursue the life-changing path of higher education without the additional financial burden imposed by previous proposals,” Faust wrote in her statement Wednesday.
With an endowment tax set to become reality, though, Faust wrote that Harvard’s tax-related advocacy efforts are far from over.
“We will assess the damaging impacts of this tax legislation moving forward, and we will continue to engage policymakers in substantive conversations on higher education finance to ensure a deeper understanding of the role college and university endowments play in making higher education accessible to students from across the country,” she wrote.
