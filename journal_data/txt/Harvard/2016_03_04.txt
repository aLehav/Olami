After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“You want it? / Why don’t you look out the window,” snarls Guerilla Toss’s lead singer Kassie Carlson in “Multibeast TV,” the opening track to the group’s latest album, “Eraser Stargazer.” From that jarring beginning onward, the noise punk unit immediately sets itself up for half an hour of explosive, discordant content. With an altered lineup and a new label (the New York-based DFA Records), the band deliver on this promise, producing more of their signature riotously eclectic music,  albeit more professionally—the skronky synths, guttural vocals, and cowbell cameos are certainly cleaner. Indeed, “Eraser Stargazer” evokes the spirit of groovy, experimental rock that defines the group but does so with a certain restraint that lends unexpected vibrancy and eccentricity to their sound.
True to its title, “Eraser Stargazer” is Guerilla Toss’s dreamiest production to date. The five-piece’s debut LP, “Gay Disco,” was danceable, filled to the brim with unwieldy energy and ready-made for play at a hip, avant-garde discotheque. In comparison, “Eraser Stargazer” is more muted and controlled—almost minimalist, if such a descriptor can be applied to an album dominated by unruly vocals and a healthy serving of distorted instruments as a guiding force. Take, for example, “Perfume,” a track characterized by repetition in both rhythm and lyrics. “It could be like / It could be like / A perfume / After an idea / Is absent,” Carlson says, her words marching to the beat of the shrill, reverberating guitar strums and rolling drums. This orchestration repeats several times during the song’s four minutes, broken up only when Carlson’s voice melds with the disco-infused beat via a series of shrieking, cooing sounds and unintelligible speak-song.
This obsession with reiteration is not novel for Guerilla Toss. For instance, in “Operate” of “Gay Disco,” Carlson similarly relies on a limited, repetitive set of lyrics, but the track also features shifts in tempo and words that are unpredictable, swift, bewildering. “Perfume” is different in its circularity; fewer surprises exist, so that when Carlson shouts “To stop / Arrest” for the second time, the utterance comes as no shock. That is not to say that “Perfume” is stale or spiritless. While not spontaneous in its composition, the song remains infectious and dynamic—an anthem for art-punk aficionados, with its blend of rallying cadence and pulsing repetition.
In fact, the songs of “Eraser Stargazer” each contain an unceasing motif, a rhythmic thread that lends cohesion. For instance, “Color Picture” has its driving, ever-present drums and sliding keyboard synths, while the semi-eponymous “Eraser Stargazer Forever” relies on rattling chimes and intense distortion. And “Doll Face on the Calico Highway,” the most tempered track on the album, is a hazy, otherworldly product, in which Carlson sheds her shrill intonations for a husky serenade that recalls spoken word. Juxtaposed against her self-assertive flair in earlier tracks, the vocals of “Doll Face” feel stripped down, and the effect is a haunting finish—one in which the toned-down mood of the album rings more prominent.
Despite the decreased level of haphazardness in the music, “Eraser Stargazer” is not an album for the passive listener. Guerilla Toss remain committed to the discordant melodies of its previous releases, and their latest album demands full attention for the audience to appreciate the medley of instruments, unique sounds, and vocalizations. Even the shortest track on the album, “Multibeast TV,” presents a cacophonous mix of bells, dysmorphic beats, and ethereal, funky synths. In that way, “Eraser Stargazer” posits an intriguing paradox for Guerilla Toss—one in which the band continues to guarantee an in-your-face, head-banger sort of deal while delivering a coherence unprecedented in their earlier works.
What does this change mean for the noise-funk quintet? Is it an indication of evolution for the band? Faced with the album’s intricate, often indecipherable orchestration, one may never reach a clear answer, but the album doesn’t demand a response. Instead, sit back, relax, and listen. “Eraser Stargazer” is a wild ride, and a nebulous one at that.
“Eraser Stargazer” is out March 4 via DFA Records.

Based on a naive, book-jacket description, “The Life of Elves” seems as if it must have an entirely different author from “The Elegance of the Hedgehog” or “Gourmet Rhapsody.” Few authors make such a radical change from character-driven, subtle realism to full-blown fantasy; even fewer can execute that change successfully. Unbelievably, however, Muriel Barbery has transitioned from sketching the intimate story of a concierge and a young girl to crafting a magical tale without losing any of her talent for character creation or command of language. In “The Life of Elves,” Barbery again places young women in the foreground: this time a pair, Clara and Maria, whose parallel lives in a French village and in Rome quickly begin to intertwine as their respective magical abilities come into play. The fantastical paradigm in which Barbery places this pair is perhaps an even better venue than realism for the empathy and perspicaciousness with which she depicts the unique perspective of childhood. And so, despite the occasional awkwardnesses of plot and character that accompany a fantasy story painted with perhaps too broad a brush, “The Life of Elves” is an impressive first attempt at genre and a worthy display of Barbery’s considerable talents.
The storyteller-like narrative voice Barbery has selected is the wisest choice made in the composition of the novel and does a great deal to create a cohesive genre work. Even independent of its plot, the novel reads like a fairy tale: When she occasionally addresses the reader, Barbery creates the sense of a rich mythos and a universe rife with magic. In introducing Clara, Barbery writes, “Anyone who doesn’t know how to read between the lines of life need only remember that this little girl grew up in a remote village in Abruzzo between a country priest and his old, illiterate housekeeper.” Barbery invites the reader to be complicit in the magic of her story, to accept it as basic fact as one would do when reading Brothers Grimm fairy tales.
As Barbery draws the reader into the magic of her constructed universe, so too does she generate magnetism in the more banal aspects of her setting. In particular, her depictions of the bucolic French village in which Maria grows up are so replete with well-chosen detail it seems as if Barbery must have grown up in such a place herself. She describes with care each meal Maria’s four grannies prepare, each herbal cure they utilize, each of the basic chores their lives demand. Even Barbery’s language itself adapts to the rural setting: “There were a few months on the farm as flat as a loaf without yeast,” she writes, a simile that might have been thought up by one of the grannies.
Her main characters, Clara and Maria, are crafted with a similar degree of believability. Preteens throughout the novel, the pair view the world around them with the vivid imagination of childhood. Though the magic powers both possess likely do factor into their colorful views of the world, Barbery clearly does not care to define which of their perceptions stem from normal childhood and which are the product of their fantastical universe: [Inthis][SPACE] way, the fantasy itself becomes more believable. Clara is a preternaturally skilled pianist who sees landscapes and stories in everything she plays, and Barbery conveys these visions with lush description. “When she had played the Russian sonata,” she writes, “there had been a splendor of trees with silvery leaves, mingled with vast dry prairies where rivers ran and, at the very end, she had the vision of a rushing wind in a wheat field where the stalks were flattened by gusts before springing back up in an animal roar.” While magically endowed piano ability might grant someone the capacity to see such an image in a collection of notes, so too, Barbery suggests, could childhood itself. Maria’s imagination behaves similarly: “Someone was walking through the mist only a few inches ahead of her,” she thinks, “and this presence gave a strange tug at her heart, as if the organ were coiling in upon itself and bringing strange images to her.” The idea of a heart “coiling in upon itself” seems so novel, so strange as to necessarily come from the naive mind of a child; that Barbery conceived of such an image herself displays her unnatural capacity for putting herself in a youthful mindset. In “The Life of Elves” and “The Elegance of the Hedgehog,” Barbery has shown herself to be one of the greatest writers of children since C. S. Lewis.

After publishing “The Lowland” to good reviews in 2013, acclaimed author Jhumpa Lahiri moved to Rome and stopped writing in English. “In Other Words,” her nonfiction debut, began as a diary in Italian. In the book, Lahiri’s original Italian writing remains on the left-hand side of each page spread, across from the English translation done by Ann Goldstein (translator for such eminent Italian authors as Elena Ferrante and Primo Levi). Twenty-three chapters—each of which could stand alone as an essay or story, and one of which, “Exile,” has already done so in “The New Yorker”—artfully and touchingly paint Lahiri’s journey into a new life, metaphorical descriptions of her relationship to Italian and English, the more technical aspects of her linguistic transition, and reflections on the role language plays in her life.
Lahiri’s resumé boasts a Pulitzer Prize, a seat on President Obama’s Committee on the Arts and Humanities, and a professorship at Princeton University, but she embraces her uncertainty in this second language. Explaining her choice not to translate the book herself, she writes: “I wanted the translation of ‘In altre parole’ to render my Italian honestly, without smoothing out its rough edges, without neutralizing its oddness, without manipulating its character.” The book is equally bold in its content. “In Other Words” deviates drastically from Lahiri’s bread-and-butter stories about first- and second-generation Bengali-American immigrants. The often suburban revelations of Lahiri’s prior fiction might induce déjà vu' or even boredom in dedicated readers, but this new, unexplored language offers a chance to freshly appreciate her unique sensitivity and quiet power. In her first entirely Italian short story, “The Exchange,” Lahiri writes: “She arrived as the season was changing. It was warm in the sun, cool in the shade.” There are no stunts, sleight-of-hand structures, or too-clever-by-half motifs. Such language—elegant, but sparse enough that the emotion beneath always carries—sounds familiar issuing from Lahiri’s pen, reminiscent of the works that elevated her to popularity some time ago.
Unlike in her fiction, however, Lahiri happily peels back the surface of language in her latest work, revealing its simple and graceful scaffolding. “Now I realize that I’m describing my relationship with Italian in another way, that I’ve introduced a new metaphor,” Lahiri confesses, in a chapter titled “The Hairy Adolescent,” in which she casts English as her hairy adolescent child and Italian as her baby. “Until now, the analogy had always been romantic: a falling in love. Now, as I translate myself, I feel like a mother of two children….” At various points throughout the book, Italian is also a lover, a lake, an ocean, a forest, an outfit, [Vcnice][SP], independence. English is a stepmother and a feral carnivore. Lahiri is the Greek nymph Daphne, transforming, via Italian, into a new self. At times, this deluge of metaphors begins to feel like inundation, and there are a few moments where the sentiments read too neatly, prompting a reaction not unlike how one would respond to a close friend’s cheesy pun. Writing about her struggle to distinguish between the simple and imperfect past tense, Lahiri explains: “Needless to say, this obstacle makes me feel, in fact, very imperfect. Although it’s frustrating, it seems fated. I identify with the imperfect because a sense of imperfection has marked my life...The more I feel imperfect, the more I feel alive.” But the driving wisdom beneath, no matter how many times one has heard it before, always rings true. Each metaphor is apt, and the genre does not demand that Lahiri restrain herself. Her joy in simply working with language emanates from every page, making every chapter and all its abundant metaphors a pleasure to read.
The uncomplicated frankness of Lahiri’s voice allows her to cover a satisfyingly wide range of subjects. She expresses and reframes familiar sentiments about the nature of love, both romantic and maternal, through the lens of her relationship to Italian and offers fascinating peeks into her world. She fishes in the Roman air and in Italian dictionaries for elusive adjectives, analyzes her own stories, and struggles with her newfound stylistic inelegance. In some of the book’s most poignant moments, she confronts such topics as her neuroses about writing, even in English; her conflicted feelings toward Bengali and English and the way in which they muddle her heritage and sense of identity; and the feelings of displacement that her linguistic and geographical nomadism inevitably create. These last revelations tactfully alternate with more biographical and language-learning focused chapters, so that overall, the book never feels too densely confessional—even while it resonates with haunting vulnerability.
As a milestone in Lahiri’s career, “In Other Words” embodies a tremendous feat: the relinquishment of the mastery and comfort of the old, and the complete, unsparing immersion in the new. As a feat of writing, “In Other Words” transcends its status as an individual’s historical document, becoming a manuscript about what it means to love and create. “From the creative point of view,” Lahiri notes, “there is nothing so dangerous as security.” In what felt to her like a dangerous leap of faith, she lets her insights stand naked and alone, garbed in neither character nor plot—and all the more beautiful and true for their lovely guilelessness.

For the characters of 30 Rock, Florida is a mélange of conservative Cubans, Jewish retirees, serial killers, secretly gay Disney princes, bus passengers who ran out of money, swamp people, and pirates. For author Tim Dorsey, it’s the state where prosthetic legs covered in Willie Nelson bumper stickers regularly wash ashore. And for Marco Rubio, it’s a last-chance opportunity to convince the American people that he is a feasible alternative to the unstoppable Trump juggernaut—and, far more consequentially, that the Republican party can still be the flagship of an increasingly and perhaps irretrievably populist, pseudo-conservative American right.
Rubio, who spent his Super Tuesday in Miami, presumably realizes the high stakes of the Florida primary. Unlike most of the previous ones, Florida’s is a winner-take-all competition with just shy of 100 delegates up for grabs. Perhaps more important than the prospect of doubling his paltry delegate count, a Rubio victory here would play into the theme of momentum that the Senator’s team has so strategically pushed to cover his meager showing in elections so far—Rubio’s electability shouldn’t be discounted because of his losses of the past, but bolstered by his potential for success in the future. The Florida primary is also critical because it answers a question that perhaps Rubio doesn’t want answered: If he cannot win in his home state, where can he?
That last question is a scary one. Trump is trouncing Rubio by a comfortable margin in the polls, beating him in all demographics except, strikingly, the college-educated. To Rubio’s credit, Florida Republicans are an eclectic bunch—unlike their Southern brethren, they are not mostly white evangelicals, who are Trump’s most consistent supporters. Rubio is specifically targeting the strong conservative Cuban population of south Florida, a community he spent his childhood with and whose favor he is desperately attempting to curry. Throughout the Florida campaign trail, Rubio has highlighted the endorsement of his campaign by three Latino Congressmen from Southern Florida as well as Florida’s Lieutenant Governor Carlos Lopez-Cantera.
Although it’s tempting to consider that Cruz’s Hispanic heritage and Kasich’s establishment appeal could steal Florida from Rubio, the Florida senator doesn’t even beat Trump in a simulated head-to-head competition, invalidating the popular argument that the Republican field is facing a Prisoner’s Dilemma. Far from an asset as a drop-out, Kasich will be fighting a similarly pivotal winner-take-all battle in Ohio the same day Rubio does in Florida, and will likely face an easier albeit still uphill battle against Trump in his home state. A Kasich victory in Ohio would aid Rubio in slowing down the Trump machine.
What a disheartening endgame, slowing down the Trump machine is. It implies the delay of the inevitable—the slow bleeding of a dying party—which begs the question, is it finally time to pull the trigger?
This is why Florida is so important—it’s less a battle for candidates and more one for ideologies. If Trump wins, conservatism loses. If Trump loses, all that it will demonstrate is that conservative leaders can convincingly pretend that they share the principles and priorities of a now-unrecognizable base. I was never one who celebrated Pyrrhic victory, so perhaps Florida is hardly a battle at all.
Florida’s importance lies in its meaninglessness. It is a sign of a party approaching its telos, a harbinger of a radical reinterpretation of American conservatism. One state will make the trivial distinction between a man unfit to lead an irate and weary party that is Republican only by name and a man unfit to lead any party whatsoever. The day Trump gets the nomination is the day I leave the Republican Party. The day Rubio gets it is the day I sit and think long and hard about whether I belong in a party for which Florida made the difference between him and someone like Trump. Chances are, I’ll leave the Republican Party in that case too.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The college admissions process is always a time of stress and uncertainty, and new changes to the SAT will keep it that way. The College Board is rolling out a new SAT exam with a 1600-point scale, an optional essay portion, a more narrowly focused math section, fewer obscure vocabulary words, no penalization for incorrect answers, and reading comprehension questions that weave in information from other subjects.
The redesigned SAT also features more difficult reading material in terms of both the reading and math sections. While the number of words in the reading section and the percentage of word problems in the math section have remained constant, outside analysts have said that the new exam contains more difficult reading material in terms of both diction and idea. For example, the new SAT has eliminated sentence-completion questions in favor of reading passages from the likes of John Locke and Herman Melville. Even the math problems have a greater sophistication, with one word question beginning, “An anthropologist studies a woman’s femur that was uncovered in Madagascar…”
We are concerned that these changes to the SAT reduce the test’s capacity to measure essential skills like reading proficiency and math ability, while unfairly advantaging students of privileged socioeconomic, racial, and cultural groups. By one estimate, the new math test is 50 percent reading comprehension, giving students the challenge of “wad[ing] through all the language to isolate the math.” This disadvantages students who come from families that do not speak English as a first language and could hinder such students’ performances in the math section.
Moreover, on the reading comprehension side of the new SAT, the inclusion of texts from eminent authors could penalize students of similar backgrounds. While Locke’s writing may be familiar to students who grew up in households or attended schools where they were exposed to that kind of literature, other students who grew up without that prior exposure could be seeing these texts for the first time on the SAT. This creates an uneven playing field with some students entering the exam with a significant leg up.
We acknowledge that it is important to increase the rigor of the reading section and to include texts that mirror the difficulty of what students are expected to read in college. Therefore, in order to avoid disadvantaging certain demographics while maintaining an increased level of rigor, we encourage the College Board to include texts that are not purely Western-centric. Another option is to include texts that are more modern, or even texts that were crafted for the very purpose of inclusion on the SAT. This would help ensure that every student taking the SAT is reading these texts for the first time without prior knowledge.
For these reasons, we urge Harvard to scrutinize the revamped SAT and maintain a holistic approach to admissions as these changes are implemented and examined. Since there is not yet data on how the new SAT will affect different demographics, it would perhaps be best if Harvard would indicate a preference for the ACT in the meantime.

Recent protests across university campuses have exposed the dissatisfaction that has long troubled students of color in the United States.
For most of our nation’s history, collegiate environments did not tolerate black and brown people. As political scientist Ira Katznelson explained, back then “affirmative action was white.” Only in the last half-century have students of color come to expect consideration when applying to universities, largely thanks to our utility in advancing the “compelling interest” of diversity that underlays the Supreme Court decision in Grutter v. Bollinger.
University administrators champion diversity as a means to challenge students to think critically and break down stereotypes. But even this mild aim is often reduced to an expectation that students of color conform to existing structures, allowing institutions to neglect their duty to tear out their white supremacist roots. Whether born of willfulness or ignorance, one cannot suggest that these institutions have made diversity and inclusion bona fide priorities. A true interest in diversity should encourage students of color to transform campus cultures, not assimilate into them. Ideally, these students would critique the lasting legacy of institutions that excluded them for centuries—perhaps even in acts of protest.
Harvard is not insulated from this criticism. Despite Supreme Court opinions that have touted its commitment to diversity, Harvard too has failed to understand its true meaning on an institutional level. For example, retaining a handful of professors who recognize racial inequity does not alone transform the culture of the institution to one of inclusivity. Despite inviting more students of color throughout the years, Harvard has departed little from its original design to groom intellectually elite white men.
Through their demonstrations, students have called for the removal of offensive symbols, the contextualization of sanitized academic material, and the appointment of faculty and staff of color. These demands call for a structural change in American education that requires institutions teach the continuity of our nation’s history. In doing so, the identities of all students—not just the white majority—are acknowledged and respected in a way that truly drives critical thinking and interrupts stereotyping.
This is why I’ve been in Belinda Hall for the past two weeks.
Belinda Hall was named in honor of a brave woman who successfully recovered reparations for her enslavement by the Royall family, whose wealth endowed our first law professorship. In her memory, Belinda Hall was established by Reclaim Harvard Law School to create the community and educational opportunities that demands can only roughly sketch. In essence, it has embodied diversity through the students, staff, and faculty gathering here.
In Belinda Hall, I and others have engaged in political education, comparing the writings of Stokely Carmichael and Bayard Rustin. I’ve seen critical race theorists like Native American professor Gerald Torres and Latina professor Margaret Montoya expand students’ imaginations. I’ve watched films that deal with challenging topics of race, religion, gender, and sexual orientation like "Brother Outsider" and "Omar." I’ve even enjoyed the comedy routine of Palestinian professor Amer Zahr. And as I write this, I see classmates preparing for a student-led discussion of Ta-Nehisi Coates’ "Between the World and Me" and James Baldwin’s "The Fire Next Time."
Belinda Hall is a busy but transparent student space, where all students are welcome and encouraged to engage. Each night, after a long day of scheduled programming, we discuss the problems of exclusion into the early morning hours. We laugh and cry about the hollowing of our histories—the academic erasure of our genocide, slavery, and colonization. We unpack the oppressive tool we’ve been told to call legal education.
Through these conversations we are finding our collective and individual voices. We are building the safe space that students of color have been seeking for years. With each moment spent in Belinda Hall, we are realizing true diversity and its power to foster an intellectually challenging but inclusive community when allowed to fully flourish. Here, I have finally found my place.
Unfortunately, not all have experienced Belinda Hall in the same way I have. In a recent email, Dean of Students Marcia Sells suggests that there are dissenting voices that would prefer to see Belinda Hall returned to its original state—a whitewashed hall devoid of the colorful personality that students have given it. In reminding us that the lounge must be available for “all,” Dean Sells misrepresented the environment in Belinda Hall as exclusive. It is not uncommon to hear passionate yet respectful, challenging yet congenial discussions between student activists and their critics. Belinda Hall is open to all. Yet, through her email, Dean Sells prioritized the voices of those who benefit from the status quo—who may be threatened by the conversation happening here—and placed the burden of inclusion on students of color, asking them to comfort dissenters who may be feeling uncomfortable for the first time.
But the call for the restoration of stability in Belinda Hall did not end with her email.
The administration’s subtle policing of our movement appeared to take a more aggressive tone the following morning. At 6 a.m., students sleeping in Belinda Hall were suddenly awakened when custodial staff—black and brown people like me—were sent to disrupt and dismantle Belinda Hall. Administration sent marginalized staff to confront marginalized students.
The staff apologized repeatedly, explaining that they were ordered to this task and that we should expect them each morning. But why were they apologizing? We are here fighting for them too.
We couldn’t be angry with them. Their livelihoods are at risk. So, we got up and started to clean with them. At one point, we asked for bottles of cleaning solution, but were denied because each bottle is individually assigned to a staff member out of the fear of theft. Harvard University made $62 million in operating surplus last year and yet still has custodial staff assigned to $3 bottles of cleaning solution. That aside, together the black and brown people of Harvard Law School cleaned Belinda Hall that morning to make it acceptable for protectors of the status quo.

In response to controversy over a recent cap on theater organization funding, the Undergraduate Council’s Finance Committee passed a communications bill Wednesday aimed at keeping the student body informed of the committee’s policies and activities.
Finance Committee chair William A. Greenlaw ’17 proposed the legislation, entitled the “Undergraduate Council Finance Reform Ordinance of 2016,” to address concerns over what some theater organizations had called a lack of adequate communication from the committee.
“The Finance Committee has historically made impactful financial decisions without consulting affected constituencies first,” Greenlaw said.
The legislation follows a controversial policy passed last week that led leaders of theater organizations to criticize the Finance Committee for failing to inform or consult theater groups first. During Sunday’s UC general meeting, Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club president Aislinn E. Brophy ’17 said her club was “disappointed with the lack of communication this semester.”
Greenlaw also pointed towards the declining number of grant applications since 2014 as another indicator that communication from the Finance Committee needed improvement.
 Under the new legislation, the Finance Committee will establish and maintain a “Communication Channel” with all presidents and treasurers of Office of Student Life-recognized clubs, in order to ensure that student organizations are informed about changes to financial policy.
“I’ve already gone to the OSL,” Greenlaw said. “I’ve added every single treasurer on campus [to a list]. Two hundred and thirty two new treasurers have been added, roughly 500 presidents have been added.”
The legislation requires the Finance Committee to make a “good faith effort” to reach out to consult student organizations that may be affected by new financial policy before the committee votes on a final policy. The committee will also commit to setting dates for grant hearings at the beginning of the semester, so that relevant organizations can plan ahead.
The bill also includes a provision for “bilateral budget negotiations” between the Office for the Arts, the Finance Committee, and theatrical organizations at the beginning of each semester. Greenlaw said the negotiations would help theater organizations plan their semester productions in advance by giving them a better idea of how much funding to expect.
During the meeting, the Finance Committee also allocated more than $10,000 in grants to several theater organizations, including the HRDC, BlackCAST, and Science Theater at Harvard College.
Two HRDC production—“Our Voices” and “Glory”—became the first productions to receive funding under the Finance Committee’s new “Compelling Interest Theatre Budget,” which allocates additional funding to theater productions whose subject matters align with UC-ratified compelling interests: mental health, race relations, sexual assault and harassment, and social spaces.
“Our Voices,” a show produced in collaboration with the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, addresses sexual assault, and “Glory” focuses on the topic of mental health.
UC representatives debated last week whether the new fund for theater groups would lead to the Council evaluating and endorsing the content of some productions over others. At the Finance Committee meeting Wednesday, Brophy, who has previously objected to the new compelling interests fund, said she worried that providing financial incentive for some productions over others is “coercive.”
Under the original legislation, theater productions that aligned with the Council’s compelling interests could receive up to double the funding they originally requested from the Finance Committee. In response to concerns over the new grant, Greenlaw said the Finance Committee will now use the compelling interests fund only to allocate money to qualifying productions that did not receive their full requested amount.
The two productions together received $1,885 from the Finance Committee, out of the $2,389.60 they were potentially eligible for under the legislation.
“We’re going to administer the policy in a non-coercive fashion by giving them up to what they requested,” Greenlaw said.
The committee voted unanimously to pass both the grant allocation and the communications reform during the meeting.
“This adds a lot more communication and it also addresses the most relevant stakeholders so that we don’t have this problem again,” Greenlaw said. “I think it’s a very good move.”

Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh recently selected data analytics company Green River as the vendor to carry out his plan to end chronic homelessness in Boston by 2018 by using data analytics to connect resources with those in need.
Based in Cambridge and in Brattleboro, Vt., Green River uses software engineering for social justice, according to founder and CEO Michael Knapp.
“We’ve been doing programming with a social mission, working towards school improvement, environmental protection, and public health,” Knapp said. “This sounded like a perfect project for us.”
The mayor selected Green River from nine companies to build “a web-based application that will provide a unified site where housing providers can share available opportunities and will enable housing navigators to easily suggest and communicate those opportunities to homeless individuals,” according to a press release from the Mayor’s office.
Knapp said the company learned of the opportunity with only a week before the proposal deadline and “dropped everything” to work on their application.
“We felt that if we can contribute to addressing homelessness, there is nothing we’d rather do,” he said.
The digital effort is part of Walsh’s plan to reform Boston’s homelessness response system, in tandem with the City’s goal to end chronic homelessness by 2018. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development defines chronic homelessness as an “unaccompanied individual with a disabling condition” who has been homeless for a year or more, or has had at least four periods of homelessness in the past three years.
“Boston’s current response to homelessness is a collection of effective, yet fragmented, programs that offer a variety of services to individuals experiencing homelessness,” the plan said. “To make progress toward ending homelessness, we must shift from a group of independent programs to one single integrated system founded on Housing First principles.”
Boston has a low number of unsheltered homeless people compared to other cities of its size, according to a 2013 report by the City on homelessness. In 2012, a census of the homeless by the City counted 193 people living on the street and found that nearly 97 percent of Boston’s homeless have access to a shelter.
"Boston has a phenomenal network of providers, staffed by hardworking people who dedicate their lives to our city, and now we have the opportunity to build on their work to better serve Boston's homeless individuals," Walsh said in a press release.
The mayor’s plan calls for a system that will decrease the barriers to appropriate housing for the homeless. The new system will “match homeless individuals, based on their specific needs, to the right housing and service resources,” a process that will be aided by the data analysis work of Green River.
A trial version of Green River’s app is expected to launch in April.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge residents will soon be able to legally purchase medical marijuana near Harvard Square if Sage Cannabis has its way.
The dispensary company has leased a location near Harvard Square, but faces a hazy road ahead because of Cambridge zoning laws.
While Sage Cannabis has leased a location on Massachusetts Avenue consistent with strict state requirements, according to Michael H.L. Dundas, the company’s CEO, the location is not within one of the two legal zones for medical marijuana dispensaries in Cambridge.
At a February City Council meeting, Sage Cannabis filed a petition to alter the dispensary zones and allow their establishment in the center of Cambridge. The Council subsequently referred the petition to its Zoning and Ordinance Committee.
The dispensary would be the first of its kind in Cambridge, according to Dundas, and would sell marijuana grown in Millford, Mass.
“What we are trying to do with our application is expand the zone—so leave those two zones in place, and add an additional space in the city center of Cambridge that would allow for a dispensary-only zone that would be closer to where patients would actually live,” Dundas said .
After a 2012 statewide ballot measure legalized medical marijuana, the Mass. Department of Public Health created subsequent local zoning regulations. The regulations at the time outlined specific regions of Cambridge where a dispensary could be established. Dundas argued the current locations are not conducive to dispensaries.
“The complexity in this case is that those zoning overlays were created to be complementary to a state process that was arduous, and a little bit slow, and a little bit unworkable for dispensaries and also for local governments,” Cambridge City Councillor Nadeem A. Mazen, a member of the Council’s Ordinance Committee, said.
The State Department of Public Health subsequently changed the licensing procedures, allowing more dispensaries to open.
“DPH has changed the rules,” Dundas said.  “So long as applicants are qualified, there is no longer any cap on licenses.”
Despite the changes in statewide regulation, Cambridge’s zoning still reflects the initial limitations placed on medical marijuana dispensaries. Dundas is petitioning for a zoning overlay that would allow additional dispensaries to be constructed within a new more-centrally located zone in Cambridge.
The new dispensary would be “equidistant” from Harvard Square and Central Square, according to Dundas.  Only DPH-approved individuals would be able to enter the establishment, let alone purchase the drug.
“Unless you have a valid DPH-issued ID card in your possession at the time you visit our facility, you can’t get in,” Dundas said.
The Ordinance Committee of the City Council will hold a televised hearing on March 24, where they will consider the new zoning petition.
“I would definitely say that the comments from a lot of my colleagues have been that there may be a workable solution here,” Mazen said. “But we’re certainly going to have to implement that solution within the confines of the law.”
Dundas is hopeful the Council will make the necessary changes allowing him to open his dispensary.
“I think that they recognize that the proposal we put forward is likewise very thoroughly thought through,” he said. “It is not a fly-by-night proposal. This is something that we took great care in preparing.”

As Harvard continues its rapid growth in Allston, the Boston Department of Parks and Recreation is seeking University funding to revamp North Allston’s Smith Field playground.
Last Thursday, the Parks Department presented its master plan for the park to a committee comprised of Boston officials and Allston residents charged with allocating Harvard’s $5.35 million grant to neighborhood projects. The University disbursed the money to the executive committee as part of Harvard’s $43 million community benefits package outlined in the master plan for its Allston developments.
The plan proposes a complete redesign of the 14-acre space located on Western Avenue, southwest of Harvard Stadium. In addition to baseline improvements in accessibility, lighting, and greenery, the updated park would include four baseball diamonds, basketball courts, a turf field, and a new playground for young children. City officials also suggested that public art be installed in the park’s community space.
The playground update carries a pricetag of $15.5 million, according to Parks Department spokesperson Ryan Woods. Woods said the department hopes to receive full funding for the project but acknowledged that its sticker price surpasses the funds Harvard allocated to neighborhood projects.
In its 63-slide presentation at the committee meeting, the Parks Department cited “significant growth and change” in the area as an impetus for the Smith Field renovation. Woods also cited dilapidated infrastructure as one of the main motivations for the update, noting that the Parks Department upgrades its fields every 12 to 15 years to “stay up to code.”
He added that residents have voiced complaints about the layout of the site, currently home to overlapping baseball and soccer fields, two basketball courts, a hockey court, and a playground.
“People say it’s very congested, like you can’t have all three fields be going at the same time, because somebody’s going to get hurt with a foul ball,” Woods said. “People are running into each other.”
Though the new plan addresses residents’ previous concerns over the spacing of playing fields, some Allstonians have expressed dissatisfaction with what they term the inadequate amount of proposed “community space.”
Paul Berkeley, longtime area resident and president of the Allston Civic Association, said he’d like to see a plan “more orientated to the neighborhood” as opposed to “ball fields for teams that come from all over” the greater Boston area.
“Places where people can sit, maybe some sort of little gazebo where they could have a band on summer nights, those are the kind of things that could encourage people to live in the neighborhood,” Berkeley said, adding that the neighborhood currently gets little use out of the site.
Despite his reservations about the proposed master plan for Smith Field playground, Berkeley said he was pleased that Harvard may help to fund a renovation of the site.
“The community [has] no resources to build these things and Harvard [has] those kind of resources,” he said. “It just makes sense to me to build a better relationship between the institution and the community, and it gives us both a place to gather and meet each other in these spaces.”

Since taking the helm of the Social Sciences division last fall,  Dean Claudine Gay said she is prioritizing improving the experience of junior faculty members on the tenure track, which at Harvard is notoriously rigorous.
Gay said she hopes to have gone to lunch with each junior faculty member in the division by the end of  the semester, a project she began in the fall. From the conversations she has had so far, Gay said it is apparent tenure track faculty members want more opportunities for feedback from scholars outside of Harvard. To that end, she began a program that allows junior faculty members to spend a day discussing their research with a scholar from anywhere in the world.
“That’s a concrete thing that I’m excited that I’m able to launch and that I know will be a big part of the kinds of support that I want to provide,” Gay said.
Gay said she also hopes to communicate well as an administrator with junior faculty members. Harvard’s tenure track, which typically lasts 7 or 8 years—a duration longer than many other universities—can be particularly difficult to navigate— especially for young faculty with children.
“We want to create an environment where every day that they’re here, there’s a strong reason why they’re here,” Gay said. “We want to create an environment where our faculty don’t even want to entertain the possibility of leaving here.”
Keeping women faculty is especially important, Gay said, as they tend to have higher rates of attrition.
Regarding the division's curriculum, Gay said she has not been closely following current student initiatives around various ethnic studies programs, but believes the University’s offerings in ethnic studies have increased significantly since she attended the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
“Maybe the challenge now is less about making sure that there’s a place in the curriculum for these really important topics, and I think they’re important, that’s why I work on them, but bringing more visibility for what we already have,” she said.

Mather administrators have walked back a policy banning hard alcohol in the House’s Junior Common Room, just weeks after notifying students of the decision.
Responding to strong pushback from students, House administrators have enacted a new policy that now allows for liquor as long as it is served by two bartenders over the age of 21.
Mather’s leadership said the reasons behind the change are twofold. First, Mather House Resident Dean Luke Leafgren said administrators made the original changes without adequate student input. Shortly after Mather implemented the hard alcohol ban, The Crimson’s editorial board  penned an editorial criticizing the move, and wrote that in addition to lacking student support, the ban would likely encourage undergraduates to drink liquor in private spaces, posing more risk for unsafe consumption.
The hard alcohol ban would  “discourage students from hosting parties [in the JCR] and work against the growing desire for a thriving, House-centered social experience,” the editorial said. “Alternative drinking spaces, such as students’ dorm rooms, pose much greater risk.”
Mather Faculty Dean Michael D. Rosengarten said the House Committee had a large influence in revising the policy, and added the changes were also sparked in part by The Crimson's staff editorial and emails from concerned students.
“We understand that there are probably a million ways of getting hard alcohol into a party,” Rosengarten said. He added that the new policy acknowledges the role hard alcohol plays in social life, while also designating bartenders to ensure parties’ safety.
Al B. Corvah ’18, a member of Mather’s House Committee and an Undergraduate Council representative, agreed with Rosengarten that a ban would be ineffective.
“Kids could sneak hard alcohol into the JCR, which has been done a few times,” he said. “The other argument is that people would pregame with hard alcohol anyways, and you can’t control that.”
Rosengarten said the accommodation is one of many ways in Mather attempts to center students’ social life within the House—other initiatives include the “Fast Pass” party registration process and a sophomore orientation pilot program.
The move comes during a year in which the College’s social scene has dominated campus conversation. College administrators have rolled out numerous new efforts to promote social life in the Houses.
A new Cabot House  initiative introduced this academic year allows students to bypass traditional party registration similar to Mather’s “Fast Pass,” and several Houses have created designated common spaces for social events.

The Harvard Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy gave its Goldsmith Career Award for Excellence in Journalism to Walter Isaacson ’74 on Thursday at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum.
Isaacson is the former CEO of CNN and former editor of Time, and has written multiple bestselling biographies, including those of Steve Jobs, Albert Einstein, and Benjamin Franklin. Isaacson is also a member of the Harvard Board of Overseers.
During his acceptance speech Thursday evening, Isaacson focused on the relationship between technology and journalism, and the potential business models for newspapers in the future.
“The two sins that happened was first we allowed and even indulged anonymity,” Isaacson said, referring to when the internet first launched. “The other original sin...is that we made it free when we put everything online.”
The latter, he said, is destructive because newspapers have to obtain their revenues mostly from advertisers, which means some have to prioritize page views above content. Now, newspapers are not only beholden to their readers, he argued, but also to “aggregating eyeballs” for advertisers.
Isaacson proposed that newspapers, instead of allowing the public to view their content for free or opting for a subscription model, use a “small payment system” where consumers can pay for individual articles that they are interested in reading.
The Center also gave the Goldsmith Award for Investigative Reporting—chosen from six finalists—to a team of reporters at the Associated Press, for their coverage of slavery in the Thai seafood industry. Additionally, the Shorenstein Center awarded the Goldsmith Book prizes to two books about journalism: "Political Journalism in Comparative Perspective and Lincoln" and "The Power of the Press: The War for Public Opinion".
The Associated Press piece, written by Margie Mason, Robin McDowell, Martha Mendoza, and Esther Htusan, shed light on the plight of slaves in Thailand, “some locked in cages, some no longer living,” according to Thomas E. Patterson, interim director of the Shorenstein Center and Kennedy School professor.
The article spurred international action, ultimately resulting in the freeing of more than two thousand fishermen, including some who had been enslaved for more than two decades, according to Patterson. Since that time, Patterson said politicians have held congressional hearings and introduced legislation on the matter.
The Goldsmith awards, which recognize journalism that “promotes more effective and ethical conduct of government” through reporting first debuted in 1991. the investigative reporting award comes with $25,000 for the winner and $10,000 for each of the other five finalists. The Goldsmith Book Prizes also come with a $5,000 award.

A crowd of more than 20 debated the efficacy of required “community conversations” on identity after recent polling showed that about one fifth of a large portion of the freshman class found the program “very/generally ineffective.”
At a town hall meeting Thursday evening, undergraduates discussed the programming, held annually for freshmen during the first days of fall semester, that centers on race, identity, and inclusion. This year, all freshmen were required to read Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s autobiography, "My Beloved World", and to discuss the work with their entryway in a facilitated setting.
Polling collected by Harvard’s Office of Institutional Research found that about a fifth of the over 1300 polled freshmen considered  this year’s conversations “very/generally ineffective” across three categories. Notably, male respondents were significantly less likely to rate the conversations as effective compared to their female peers.
“We saw the results, and we’ve seen past results, and we know that there’s something missing in how this is going,” Katherine W. Steele, Director of College Initiative and Student Development at the FDO, said. “This matters to us. There’s no point in bringing everyone together in the way that Harvard brings people together if we’re not actually going to learn together.”
Steele and UC leaders said Thursday’s town hall stemmed from a desire to share data on the conversations and seek student feedback on improvements to the conversations.
“We have the survey, we know what the numbers are, but we want to put faces to those numbers,” Nicholas Whittaker ’19, a UC representative for Crimson Yard, said. “We want to see what students really have to say.”
Audience members offered several suggestions for ways the conversations could be made more effective. UC representative for Oak Yard Olu Oisaghie ’19 said he thought that part of the problem with this year’s conversations was the required reading.
“It was an interesting memoir and it was nice to read, but I don't know if it was very conducive toward the kind of issues that community conversations is meant to be addressing,” Oisaghie said. “There are much better readings out there that could capture what we're going for in terms of sparking conversations about diversity and race relations on campus.”
Other students, including UC vice-president Daniel V. Banks ’17 questioned the length of the required reading, which he said students were unlikely to read in full.
“Something that might be easier to accomplish is making the reading short and having it be Harvard-specific,” Banks said. “A lot of the heated personal debates going on now are things that directly involve Harvard and its complex history.”
UC president Shaiba Rather ’17 said she was frustrated with the fact that this conversation was the only required one of its kind during students’ tenure at the College.
“I think we should hold ourselves to a higher standard where we don't expect this conversation to be the only one our entire four years,” Rather said.
The Undergraduate Council’s Freshman Class Council and the Freshman Dean’s Office sponsored the town hall on Thursday evening.

When Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith announced last week that House masters would be renamed Faculty Deans, the change was, for some, more than just a tweak to an administrative title.
For some faculty members and undergraduates, Harvard’s traditional “House master” title seemed an uncomfortable anachronism, associated—though not intentionally—with slavery. For others, the title was a distinctive piece of Harvard heritage, deriving its roots from medieval European universities and reinforcing the College’s academic tradition.
In an email to Harvard students and FAS affiliates announcing the change, Smith endeavored, in part, to reconcile both views and appease generations of Harvard alumni who had known their undergraduate house leaders as masters, not deans. 
While Smith endorsed the title change as important step towards creating a “transformative experience” for students, he recognized the historical and sentimental value the title might hold for alumni.
“Many alumni will remember House leaders as the Master of their beloved House, and they should have no qualms in doing so,” Smith wrote. “The term House Master is and will remain a part of the College’s long and proud history.”
The initial decision to change the title, announced last semester, prompted Eliot alumnus Dale A. Jenkins ’60 to write lengthy letters to Smith and William F. Lee ’72, the senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body. Jenkins argued that changing the House master title “would throw the entire position of house leadership into question. In addition, it would be a rejection of the cherished experiences of thousands.”
And one week after the new title was unveiled and promptly broadcast across national media outlets, some alumni are still grasping what they see as a needless encroachment on Harvard tradition. Former Winthrop House resident Laurence J. Gillis ’64 scoffed at the new name.
“I think it is an exquisitely sensitive response to a problem that simply was not there,” he said. “And, worse, it exposes Harvard to ridicule that it simply does not need, not now.”
Brett R. Angney ’71, a former Kirkland House resident, said he found the change unnecessary and unjustified. “I have a master’s degree—should that be a dean’s degree now?” he asked. “There are more important things to be concerned about with race relations than House masters. The first time I read about that I went, ‘You have got to be kidding.’”
But while alumni critics of the change have been more vocal on the comment boards, others—like former Pforzheimer resident tutor Jay Gabler—have embraced the new title.
“People outside Harvard are already going to have a hard time, in many ways, thinking of Harvard as a tolerant, accepting place that is anything but stuffy and stuck-up,” Gabler said. “So to come in and be mentioning this title of House master just adds to the negative impression some people have.”
Gabler, who wrote a blog post praising Harvard’s decision, said he believes the new Faculty Dean title comes closer to describing the responsibilities of the position. “The change has left me more impressed with Harvard, rather than less,” he said.
Jeannie Park ’83, a Leverett alumna and diversity advocate, agreed with Gabler and said she supports Harvard College Dean Rakesh Khurana in any effort to improve race relations on campus.
“There are a lot of very difficult issues that students, faculty, and administrators are struggling with, and I know Harvard has been trying to take the lead on many fronts in terms of discrimination,” Park said.
Harvard donor and former Eliot House resident Paul J. Zofnass ’69 said that he is warming to the change. While he said he initially had preferred the more traditional House master title, Zofnass eventually came to see Faculty Dean as preferable.
“If it somehow sends that message or suggests that this is part of Harvard culture to be sensitive to as many as minorities as possible, if that’s the message, then I am definitely in favor of it,” Zofnass said. “It is a good thing. It’s a very good thing.”
Prathama K. Nabi ’11, who lived in Winthrop, also said she found the title change encouraging, calling it a “launchpad to the bigger and better issues around racism and inequality and inequity in this country.” She also noted that discourses on race and inclusivity at Harvard have become more prevalent since she was a student a few years ago.
“I think that’s what has been very interesting—it feels like issues and conversations about race and social justice are a lot more pervasive around different communities around Harvard now than when I was in college,” Nabi said.
For Jenkins, adopting the new title is just another sign that today’s Harvard is quite different from the school he attended more than 50 years ago.
“I was there at a particular time and now those times have changed,” Jenkins said. “My whole experience is kind of archival at this point.”

For a school with roughly 800 students and five different masters programs, the Graduate School of Design only employs two full time career service officers, a number some students have expressed concern over.
The months of February and March represent the heart of the summer and post-graduate opportunity search for GSD students. Many turn to resources at the GSD Career Services Office, which range from electronic resume reviews to career fairs and community service fellowships.
Behind all these resources is a team of student interns and liaisons and two full time staff. One is a student career counselor while the other employee deals mostly with external relations.
GSD Student Forum members have lobbied for increased career resources in recent months.  Courtney D. Sharpe, the forum’s Alumni Relations Co-Chair, said current staff members are helpful but could use more support due to the diverse needs and interests of students. Other students voiced similar concerns.
“Because the disciplines are so distinct here, I’m not sure the extent to which it is possible for career services to deeply understand every discipline,” Master of Design Studies candidate Peter Erhartic said.
Still, Erhartic said he has not noticed the job resources detrimentally affecting employment prospects within his specific concentration, the Real Estate and Built Environment program. Other students also said the low number of counselors has not negatively impacted their educational experience or career paths.
“I don’t think [the office] would need to be any larger [based on] what I understand they do, provided they are good at what they do,” Master of Design Studies candidate Alexander Duffy said.
Still, some students point out a discrepancy in career resources between the GSD and other Harvard Graduate schools. The Graduate School of Education, which has a student population similar to that of the GSD,  employs seven staff members in their career services office.
Director of Career Services Meryl Golden declined to comment about concerns over the number of staff members within the career service office. In her role, Golden helps coordinate fellowships, organizes workshops, and often works with students on an individual basis.
“I think she does a really good job and you can tell that she really cares and she does a lot,” Urban Planning student career liaison Shani A. Carter  “But there is only so much she can do in terms of being the head, telling everyone else what to do, and then trying to do things herself.”
Students said they recognized the challenges posed by any lack of adequate staffing, including potential barriers and missed opportunities in certain career fields due to lack of exposure.
“People might not really be exposed to things that could make the world of difference for what they want to do with their professions, and I think that is where the unfortunate part comes in,” Urban Planning student Career Liaison Shani A. Carter said of the lack of staffing.

The Germanic Languages and Literatures Department is in discussion with the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences regarding a potential joint-concentration program to be piloted in 2016, according to Department chair John T. Hamilton.
The proposed joint concentration would consist of any SEAS degree plus five higher-level German courses and a “guided reading” course completed in conjunction with a summer engineering or applied sciences fellowship in Germany. A secondary in German requires five half-courses at comparable levels as those currently proposed for the joint concentration.
As of now, the German department has endorsed the joint-program, which awaits review from SEAS before approval. In an emailed statement, Hamilton wrote, “We have the strong encouragement from the administration at SEAS and FAS.”
SEAS representatives declined to comment on the proposal.
Harvard’s newest school, SEAS has recently experienced stratospheric growth in undergraduate enrollment, securing a prime spot in the University’s ongoing capital campaign. Between 2008 and 2015, the number of SEAS concentrators has leaped from 291 to 832. By comparison, less than 10 students at the College currently concentrate in Germanic Languages and Literatures.
Hamilton said he began thinking about the joint concentration program “really concretely” last semester and some faculty at SEAS were similarly excited about the proposal.
“Ever since I started broaching the idea with my colleagues and my associates and friends at SEAS, I’ve had nothing but enthusiasm and encouragement,” Hamilton said.
Computer science professor Hanspeter Pfister, who is from Germany, said he thought the proposed concentration was “a great idea,” though he said he was not involved in the development of the proposal.
New SEAS Dean Francis J. Doyle III has pinpointed more “bridge-building” between SEAS and other schools as a goal of his tenure. In a February interview, Doyle said he was “trying to identify means of joint-degree opportunities,” though at the time he said none were ready to be announced.
Hamilton reiterated Doyle’s emphasis on interdisciplinary endeavors.
“We are a university. SEAS is not an autonomous engineering school, it’s part of FAS,” Hamilton wrote. “Creating silos between divisions doesn’t serve anyone.”
The joint-program comes at a time when Germany plays a significant role in the global engineering and energy sectors, according to Hamilton.
“Germany’s at the forefront of these technologies,” Hamilton wrote. “Our engineering students will have the capacity to read up on the latest materials and be very much engaged in the cutting edge of what’s happening in Europe.”
If approved, the program’s summer fellowship would involve a summer engineering internship at a German company or university. Though the German department has provided support for German internships in the past, granting credit for foreign internships is something “completely new” in the department, said Ruth Sondermann. the German Department's Director of Work-Abroad.
“The internship idea is not new, the internships in Germany have been provided now for the last 25 years in all disciplines,” Sondermann said. “And now within the last couple years we’ve seen an interest in going to Germany with an engineering background.”
Though Ashlyn Frahm ’19, a prospective electrical engineering concentrator currently in her second semester of beginning German, had not heard of the proposed program, she said she would be interested in considering the option.
“I would actually love to do the program. I was originally interested in doing a joint Computer Science and Electrical Engineering,” Frahm said. “But German, especially overseas with internships, helps out a lot especially in engineering.”
Frahm said she decided to take German this year partly because of the language's utility in the engineering field. “There are so many engineering firms that want to hire students that have a really well-rounded knowledge of German,” she said.
Education School Professor Howard E. Gardner wrote that the collaboration “makes sense.”
“Germany has been vital in the history of engineering, and is a major player today,” Gardner wrote.
Dean of the Arts and Humanities Diana Sorensen applauded the interdisciplinary proposal and suggested that similar initiatives could be on the horizon.
“Will it happen with many others? I wouldn’t be surprised if it did,” Sorensen said.

UPDATED: March 4, 2016, at 4:02 p.m.
A committee tasked with re-considering Harvard Law School’s seal in light of its ties to slavery recommended Friday that the Harvard Corporation revoke the emblem’s status as the school’s official symbol.
The seal bears the crest of the former slave-owning Royall family, whose donation helped establish Harvard’s first law professorship in the late 18th century. The committee sent a report to the Corporation—the University’s highest governing body— summarizing the history of the seal and arguments for and against its removal.
Their recommendation was not unanimous; two of the 12 members of the committee argued in a dissenting opinion sent along with the report that the seal should be preserved as an “honest” and conspicuous reminder of the Law School’s connection to “those enslaved at the Royall Plantation.”
However, all committee members agreed that the Law School should publicly acknowledge the symbol’s association with slavery.
The seal, which features three sheaves of wheat overlaying a blue background, has provoked intense dialogue about diversity and inclusion at the Law School since the fall, and has evolved into a rallying point for activists demanding better treatment for minorities there. The student group Royall Must Fall began calling for the seal’s removal in late October, a call that intensified after a racially-charged incident of vandalism later in the semester.
In late November, Law School Dean Martha L. Minow created a committee to re-evaluate the seal and issue a recommendation to the Corporation, which holds final decision-making authority. Minow chose the four faculty members—Janet E. Halley, Tomiko Brown-Nagin, Annette Gordon-Reed, and Samuel Moyn—and two alumni, James E. Bowers and Robert J. Katz, on the committee, appointing Law professor Bruce H. Mann as its chair. The Law School student government selected three students—Rena T. Karefa-Johnson, Mawuse Barker-Vormawor, and Ann C. Rittgers and the staff joint council chose two staff members—Darrick Northington and Yih-Hsien Shen.
 Committee members analyzed literature about the seal’s origins, held a series of community meetings in February, solicited feedback from more than 1,000 Law School affiliates, and deliberated at a meeting last week, according to the report. The months-long process culminated in a 11-page recommendation and a four-page dissenting opinion. In an accompanying memorandum sent to Corporation members Friday, Minow expressed support for the committee’s recommendation to change the seal, emphasizing the need for progress and the school’s mission to uphold justice.
The committee’s report ends with one pointed appeal.
“It is that symbol that we request the President and Fellows to release us from,” the committee members wrote.
RE-EXAMINING HISTORY
Controversy surrounding the Law School’s preeminent symbol comes as the school approaches its bicentennial in 2017—opportune timing for an examination of the institution’s history, Minow and committee members wrote. 
History played a large part in the committee’s deliberations and ultimate report, as members grappled with a question that has sparked debate at Harvard and around the world: Does removing controversial symbols constitute erasing the past?
At the College, now-Faculty Deans voted unanimously to discard the traditional title “House master,” which some students criticized for the term “master’s” association with slavery. However, University President Drew G. Faust said she opposes further title changes, which she argued would negate historical legacies.
Meanwhile, at Yale, students are petitioning to rename Calhoun College, and Princeton students are pushing the university to remove Woodrow Wilson’s name from its school of international affairs. Amherst eliminated its mascot and all references to Lord Jeffery Amherst, who advocated for biological warfare against Native Americans in the 18th century. And the Law School’s Royall Must Fall student activist group was modeled after Rhodes Must Fall, a movement at the University of Cape Town that successfully fought to remove a statue of imperialist and apartheid supporter Cecil Rhodes.
The committee’s arguments in favor of changing the Law School’s seal rest primarily on historical evidence, which constitutes half of their report. In the report, they argue that the negative ramifications of the seal’s use outweigh its historic value.
“There are better ways to engage the past and its legacy in the present than by retaining a symbol that so many members of the community reject,” the report says. “We believe that if the Law School is to have an official symbol, it must more closely represent the values of the Law School, which the current shield does not.”
The report corrects a common misconception that Isaac Royall, Jr.’s donation established the Law School. In fact, Royall, who died in 1781, bequeathed land in his will to Harvard College to help fund either a professorship of law or science. Harvard Law School was not officially founded until 1817.
In addition, the report emphasizes the arbitrary nature of the Royall crest’s adoption as the school’s shield. The shield was designed in 1936 by Pierre de Chaignon la Rose, a seal-drawing aficionado who created emblems for each of Harvard’s graduate schools. The Harvard Corporation officially adopted the shield as the Law School’s seal soon after, and according to the report, there is no evidence the body had knowledge of the crest’s connection to slavery.
“The Law School of the present is very different from the Law School of 1937 for which the family crest of a slave-owner could be chosen as its official symbol without anyone seeing the association with slavery,” the report states.
Isaac Royall Jr.’s “only legacy was his money,” the report argues, a negligible contribution that differentiates him from other prominent slave owners like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, who are commemorated for their leadership in American history.
And, the committee wrote, only within the past two decades have people begun to consider the Royall crest’s origins, of which many remained unaware until Law professor Daniel R. Coquillette published research on the subject in 2000.
“The shield did not become seen as a symbol of slavery until very recently,” the report states.
‘SIGNIFICANT DISAGREEMENT’
In coming to a final decision, the committee members wrote they communicated with about a thousand Law affiliates, who expressed “significant disagreement” on the seal.
According to the report, divergent opinions do not break down along typical age, political, or racial lines. In a Harvard Law Record straw poll published last week, 54.6 percent of 517 respondents supported changing the seal, while 31.1 percent advocated keeping the seal but acknowledging its ties to slavery. 
Division within the committee itself was evident in the dissenting opinion authored by legal history professor Gordon-Reed and supported by second-year student Rittgers. In her dissent, Gordon-Reed called changing the shield “the more conservative option,” urging the Law School to instead be “daring” and retain the shield as a visible reminder of an uncomfortable past. Removing the seal, she wrote, “would be an abdication of our responsibility to the enslaved and a missed opportunity to educate.”
The opinion suggests that the Law School re-brand the shield shrinking the sheaves of wheat and adding the word ‘iustitia,’ which would “[make] explicit our debt to the enslaved and our commitment, in their memory, to the cause of justice.”
Gordon-Reed distinguishes between the seal and symbols commonly associated with racism–such as the Confederate or Nazi flags–writing that for the majority of the seal’s existence, it has represented not slavery but the Law School itself and the accomplishments of its graduates. Additionally, she argues that since the symbol is not an image of Isaac Royall, Jr.–unlike the statue of Rhodes–it can be used to commemorate the enslaved, rather than their owners.
In their report recommending a change, the committee wrote it “understands and regrets the disappointment it will cause fellow members of the Law School community for whom the shield invokes not Isaac Royall and his slaves but rather the institution they are proud to be part of.”
Minow–who wrote that she has informed incoming first-year students about the Royall family’s slave-owning past each year since she became dean–sided with the majority of the committee. In a memo sent to Corporation members Friday with the report and dissent, Minow endorsed the committee’s recommendation.
“We must always face not only the fact of slavery but also its legacies and ongoing questions of injustice within our community and beyond,” she wrote. “We must do so because we are dedicated to intellectual rigor and truth, and because we are willing and able to model reasoned discourse and openness to difference and dissent.”
LOOKING FORWARD
The implications of a symbol change are particularly relevant now, just after the former House masters changed their title. Reconsidering the seal raises a question of precedent, as some buildings on campus, such as Mather House, bear the name of former slave owners.
In an interview in December, Faust said her role in the seal review process was to guide Minow in considering the ramifications of a potential change. “If the seal were to be changed, would that mean we then would have the logic in place that we’d have to change the name of every single thing on campus?” Faust asked. “Or is the seal different?”
In her memo, Minow highlighted the specificities of the Royall shield’s case–including its 1936 origins and the absence of a living donor laying claim to the crest–that for her create a more compelling argument for change than can be made for other contentious symbols.
“There are complex issues involved in preserving the histories of places and institutions with ties to past injustices, but several elements make retiring the shield less controverted than some other issues about names, symbols, and the past,” she wrote.
The committee report emphasizes that the group focused specifically on the removal of the Law School’s seal, not the durability of other symbols at the University or the question of what symbol should replace the Royall crest.
“Our recommendation is limited to the symbol that officially represents Harvard Law School to the Law School community and to the larger world,” the report says.
The Corporation must agree with their recommendation to remove the shield before any change can go into effect.
“Whatever the Corporation decides about the shield, the larger discussions about our values, our culture, and the importance of strengthening our community will continue, because they must continue,” Minow wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time in their careers, Harvard’s seniors can see the end.
With a guaranteed losing record, the Crimson (12-16, 4-8 Ivy League) will almost definitely miss the postseason—making this weekend’s games against Penn (11-14, 5-6) and Princeton (20-5, 10-1) the last for the senior class. In each of the team’s last three seasons, the league championship (and Harvard’s March Madness future) hinged on the final Friday-Saturday results; this week, the Crimson can do no better than secure a fourth-place conference finish.
“[In past years], I think those guys were more focused on making sure it was not their last practice and fighting to have more practices and more games,” senior Patrick Steeves said Wednesday. “We know this will be the last of each thing so I guess it’s a silver lining that we know that and can appreciate that.”
The seniors will have plenty of motivation to leave on a winning streak, however. The Quakers and the Tigers, the Killer P’s of old, effectively buried Harvard’s Ivy League hopes with a two-game sweep in early February. The Crimson, missing leading scorer and rebounder Zena Edosomwan (thigh injury), left the weekend 1-5 in conference play. The four-game losing streak shook a team that had fancied itself a contender.
“I don’t think anybody expected this,” Steeves said after the Saturday game, a 67-57 defeat to Penn in which Harvard got outrebounded by 21.
“We’ve been running the league for a while,” he continued. “Every time that these teams beat us, it means something to them. It should mean something to us to not let them do that.”
Since losing to the Quakers, Harvard has picked it up, securing three straight weekend splits, in part by sandwiching losses to the league’s elite (Yale, Columbia) between wins over its lower class (Brown, Cornell).
The recent spurt has largely come without a full roster. While Edosomwan has returned, freshman starting point guard Tommy McCarthy missed both games last weekend due to a mid-week concussion that throws his status for this weekend in doubt. Also this week, senior wing Agunwa Okolie sat out some practice because of the flu, leaving Harvard potentially without its best slasher and wing defender.
Against Princeton on Friday, the Crimson will face an uphill battle if it is forced to play without its top perimeter defender. Harvard coach Tommy Amaker has repeatedly singled out his team’s perimeter defense as a weakness down the stretch, noting how Okolie has often been able to cover for his less experienced teammates.
“He’s had to guard anybody from [the] one to [the] four and he’s done it in an amazing way,” Amaker said. “On top of that, I think he’s played with a competitive spirit and energy that you really admire for a kid that’s a senior.”
Princeton, which leaves nobody to hide smaller guards on, is a particularly bad matchup with Okolie out. Junior Tiger wings Steven Cook, Spencer Weisz, and Henry Caruso can all drive and shoot the three, creating positional mismatches all over the floor. The point guard combination of Amir Bell and Devin Cannady—which averages 20.8 points shooting 48 percent from the field—has been a puzzle that Ivy League teams have yet to figure out.
Harvard will likely assign lock down Caruso with Okolie—the jack-of-all-trades has covered everyone from BYU’s 6’6” Kyle Collinsworth to Auburn’s 6’0” Kareem Canty. But mismatches with the Tigers are like whack-a-mole: solve one and another appears elsewhere. Amaker tried hiding McCarthy or freshman Corey Johnson around the perimeter in the last matchup, but Princeton found and exploited the matchups it liked, scoring 45 points in the second half.
“When you have four guys that can stretch the floor and they mix that in with their offense, it is definitely tough to guard,” captain Evan Cummins said. “You really need to be locked in and disciplined with your coverages and your defenses.”
The key to both weekend games is Edosomwan, who had just three points against seven fouls in contests last weekend against Yale and Brown. When he plays well, Harvard has been competitive with the league’s top teams. When he hasn’t, the games have not been particularly close.
No matter the outcome, Steeves—who missed his first three years due to repeated knee and foot surgeries—said he will maintain perspective.
“One lesson I’ve learned that stemmed from coming back from injury … is to really appreciate everything in the moment,” Steeves said. “Being sidelined for three years and then being on the court helps you realize how lucky you are when you actually get to suit up and be on the court for games.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s the final weekend of Ivy League play, a strange time in Cambridge. Amidst a bevy of thesis deadlines, getting drunk on the steps of Widener has become, like multi-paragraph Facebook orations on our country’s future, oddly popular. On the horizon, eliciting more freshman apprehension and nervousness than an ABC party, is Housing Day. The momentous week will close with the official beginning to #SpringBreak2016, a tour de force in hedonism where the only acceptable attitude is a slight shrug.
The stakes couldn’t be higher in Ivy League play, however. After escaping Dartmouth last weekend, Yale is a road sweep of the Gentleman’s C’s away from at least a share of the league title. Princeton, which comes to Lavietes tonight, can at a minimum force a playoff by taking care of business in its three remaining games against the league’s middle class. For a pair with two combined losses—both to each other—in 2016, a playoff feels less likely and more inevitable.
Yet coming into the weekend, the pressure of the race appears to be weighing on both teams. The Bulldogs, which haven’t made the tournament in 54 years, needed last-minute heroics to avoid a devastating loss to Dartmouth at home on Saturday. With captain Jack Montague on leave, Yale is perilously thin at the guard position. The Tigers, coming off their second close scare with Columbia, have flirted with danger all season—using two crazy comebacks on the road to stave off near-defeats. With a team that has never been in this position, road games in Cambridge and Hanover loom as possible stumbling blocks.
For the rest of the league, the final two games are just about playing spoiler. One could say that the Lions remain mathematically alive for a share of the title, but their title hopes are maybe better viewed as Schrodinger’s cat: science tells us they are alive, but common sense knows better. Columbia’s best opportunity comes Saturday, when it hosts the shaky Bulldogs with a chance to send its superb senior class out on a high note. Given its recent string of good performances, the Lions might be a favorite were it not for its penchant to treat close games as prime opportunities to sack-tap its fan base.
Therein lies the rub of the 14-game playoff: no other conference has such tension built into the finish or such monotony woven into the journey.
For three weeks now, the other five teams have been ostensibly eliminated from the playoff race. Columbia, Yale, and Princeton are a combined 25-0 against the rest of the league, winning those games by an average of 14.6 points. It has been 13 years since a Brown-Dartmouth tilt actually affected the league’s title race.
Against this backdrop, the call for a conference tournament has grown fiercer. While change is usually suppressed in the Ivy League by arguments for history and Ancient Eight exceptionalism, insiders indicate that a four-team playoff is almost a certainty next year.
These logistics have yet to be hashed out, but the timing looks brutal. Since Penn and Princeton close every season out four days after everyone else, the tournament would need to be played in a quick and abbreviated two-day window before Selection Sunday. Like many Ivy traditions, the Quakers-Tigers game made more sense a decade ago—when it often decided championships—than, say, last year, when Princeton’s student newspaper simply decided not to cover the event.
The reasons for the tournament are less than compelling. It’s true that a conference tournament gives every team a shot at the title, but what kind of shot is that? For every case of the 2008 Georgia Bulldogs, a team that went 4-12 in conference and rode a stirring conference tourney to the title is … well, 100 cases of the 2009 Georgia Bulldogs, a 12-20 team whose most promising prospect was the unforgettable Trey Thompkins III.
Likewise, a mid-major conference like Ivy League should want its best representative at the Dance. By KenPom, the best Ivy League team has gone to the tournament each of the last 13 years, something you can’t say for comparable leagues like the Horizon or the MEAC. The league, which is a Siyani Chambers three from having split its last 10 Tournament outings, deserves more respect, and occasionally sending its middle class to the Dance will only hurt its reputation.
Yet the most compelling argument in favor of the playoff turns this logic straight on its head. By putting its four-team playoff right before Selection Sunday, the Ivy League will get a national spotlight it can’t have the first week of March. At a time where everyone is watching basketball, the Ancient Eight can edge its way into the national conversation. As I wrote yesterday, the league is already slighted nationally—inserting a tournament would drastically increase the chances of an at-large bid.
If the 2010 Cornell team or the 2014 Harvard team—probably the two best champions of the last decade—had lost in this tournament, they surely would have deserved at-large bids. Had they not gotten them, Dick Vitale—the first, but sadly not last, pioneer of “how I feel for those kids”—would simply never let the committee forget it.
For one more year, however, there is no need to worry about conference tournaments. This weekend is about Yale, Princeton, and the seniors playing their final home games. Well, at least the first two.
On to the picks:
YALE AT CORNELL:
The disturbing underside to the Ivy title race has been the furor that erupted this week in New Haven surrounding Montague. The captain left school last week without any disclosure as to why, leaving the Bulldogs’ decisions to honor him during Friday warm-ups with shirts emblazoned with his nickname (“Gucci”) and the word YALE spelled backwards peculiar, to say the least.
Monday morning, the story took a turn. Pictures of the team in the shirts, tagged “stop supporting a rapist” sprung up around campus. Reigning Ivy League Player of the Year Justin Sears fanned the fire, acknowledging the shirts were controversial but refusing to explain any possible symbolism behind them.
Without opining about accusations regarding facts to which I am not privy, it is sufficient to say that Sears’ statement that “no one in the team is aware of what happened” to their teammate is suspicious, especially with ESPN reporting that Montague is active in the team’s group chat. Mum has been the word around New Haven, with the athletic department denying any knowledge of the creation of the shirts.
As Yale chases its first title in half a century, the circumstances are—to say the least—a heavy weight on the team’s back. It’s hard not to feel, however, that this is partially self-imposed.
Pick: Yale
PRINCETON AT HARVARD:
In other years, this might be the game of the season. In this one, it feels like a footnote.
Pick: Princeton
PENN AT DARTMOUTH:
Among the non-Harvard seniors, I’ll miss Penn center Darien Nelson-Henry most of all. The big man, who has been putting up big numbers to lead an offense full of underclassmen, has toiled for four mediocre years in Philadelphia in a program that has only recently found continuity and direction. Nelson-Henry has borne his curse in style, progressively growing out a beard that is among the best in college basketball. His post moves have certainly improved, but a beard that fearsome deserves acknowledgment.
Pick: Penn
BROWN AT COLUMBIA:
A couple weeks ago, the New York Times ran an expose on the art interests of senior Lions point guard Maodo Lo. The mother of the German point guard is a renowned painter, a fact that apparently shocked even Kyle Smith, Lo’s own coach. In his words: “I knew she was an artist, but I’m like, dude”.
Oh Howard, this Ivy league prose ain’t what it once was.
Pick: Columbia
PRINCETON AT DARTMOUTH:
Yawn.
Pick: Princeton
YALE AT COLUMBIA:
The biggest game of the weekend will be decided in the frontcourt, where Lions forward Alex Rosenberg will be tasked with both containing Sears on the defensive end and taking him away from the basket on the other end. It’s a strategy that Princeton has utilized to great success, but Rosenberg is a notorious defensive liability.
This matchup couldn’t be more unfortunate for the beat writers covering. Last weekend at Yale, a YDN member was observed Googling “what is a frontcourt” during the game. Certainly not as embarrassing as the neighboring beat writer using Internet Explorer, but a dark mark nonetheless.
Pick: Yale
PENN AT HARVARD:
On senior night, in front of a sold-out home crowd, Harvard has an opportunity for revenge on the only other inhabitant of the league’s middle class. Penn, which like the
Crimson is winless against the league’s top three teams, has gone an impressive 5-2 against the rest of the league. It wore down Harvard in the last meeting, with freshman point guard Jake Silpe badgering Tommy McCarthy into one of his worst games of the season.
In the aftermath, senior Patrick Steeves noted that the 1-5 Crimson “play all these teams again.” Harvard is 2-3 so far in its rematches, and this represents its best shot to get the third win.
Pick: Harvard
PENN AT PRINCETON:
This game should do a good job of bearing out the difference between “frisky” and “good”.
Pick: Princeton

This is not a drill, I repeat, THIS IS NOT A DRILL. Kendrick Lamar, the talented mastermind behind the Grammy-awarding winning album To Pimp a Butterfly, or TPAB as the kids are calling it, has blessed the world with a surprise eight track release called untitled unmastered. Sounds like something we would title an Expos 20 essay, tbh.
The album is a collection of eight songs named after the date they were recorded. It has been reported that all of the tracks were outtakes that didn’t quite make the cut for To Pimp a Butterfly, but Kendrick liked them so much that he felt the people deserved to hear them. We are all so #blessed.  Because of this, untitled unmastered. is being widely considered as more of a companion album to TPAB rather than a totally brand-new concept.
The whole record has a very stripped down, unprocessed, and dare we say ‘unmastered’ atmosphere. Kendrick pushes the free-jazz, experimental vibes that made TPAB so revolutionary even further, lacing each track with acoustic drumming (none of that artificial 808 nonsense for him), piano riffs, and the soulful wailing of saxophones. Oh, and can’t forget about a sick bassline to lay down the groove that we all expect from him.
In terms of lyricism, Kendrick is back with his politically charged and oh-so-relevant themes, spitting the truth left and right while leaving all of our minds blown. The line “Pimp, pimp, hooray!” pops up several times over the course of the album, unifying the tracks and creating a very complete feel to a work that otherwise plays up its unfinished edges, similar to the unfinished nature of the essay you submitted at 11:59 last night. untitled unmastered. features guest appearances from Cee-Lo Green and Jay Rock, and there is even a song produced by Alicia Keys’ five-year-old son (step aside Blue Ivy). Warning: hearing a young child who is richer and more famous than you’ll ever be may make you question whether or not that college degree is even worth it.
The new album/EP/collection of absolutely genius tracks is available on Spotify, iTunes, Apple Music, Google Play, and Tidal. Don’t worry, this isn’t a repeat of Mr. West’s refusal to give The Life of Pablo to us broke college kids.
Now go forth and have your life changed by the soon-to-be legendary untitled unmastered. Who needs to study for midterms, anyways?
