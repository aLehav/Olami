After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We all know the Grammys pit top artists head-to-head. 2017 is no different with nine Beyoncé, eight Kanye West, and five Adele nominations. Let's break down some of the most popular Grammy categories and predict who will come out on top on Sunday at 8 p.m.
2016 was filled with great albums. This category is hotly contested with Adele, Beyoncé, Drake, Justin Bieber, and Sturgill Simpson all nominated for the award. While “Views” was a new look for Drake and showed his prowess in hip-hop and newfound dancehall vibes, it is unlikely that “Views” will win over Beyoncé’s wildly popular visual album “Lemonade.”
Lukas Graham, Beyoncé, and Rihanna are frontrunners in this category for sure, but the award is likely to go home with Adele for her chilling record “Hello,” which spent ten weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 list. We’ve heard it on the radio too many times, but not enough to want it to lose out at the Grammys.
With only two viable options on the list, we’re torn. Like Kanye did in the mid-2000s, Chance the Rapper is bringing us a new age of hip-hop. The Chainsmokers don’t necessarily deserve the win, but in light of their unbelievable success and far-reaching audience, this EDM duo will probably steal the award of the night.
Kanye’s album, “The Life of Pablo,” is one of the most cohesive and thoughtful works of his career, while songs off Drake’s “Views” spent weeks on the charts. But if past Grammys are any indication, the winner of this year’s popularity contest is going to be Drake.
But what do you think? Are the Grammys’ awarding systems outdated, as Frank Ocean would say? Will Kanye West provide us another entertaining outburst? And what do Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, and Metallica have in store for the night’s performances? Of course, there’s no way to know for sure who will take home five Grammys and who will get snubbed unless you tune in on Feb. 12 to find out.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PROVIDENCE, R.I.—Perhaps late comebacks are just the way of Harvard men’s basketball.
For the fifth game in a row, the Crimson entered the locker room down at the half. Much like it has in those previous games, however, Harvard came right back late.
Following a first half shootout that saw 15 lead changes and ended with a three point Brown lead, the Crimson (13-7, 5-2 Ivy League) hung in despite the Bears (11-12, 2-5) leading by as many as 10 points in the second half.
Harvard’s comeback came about rather innocuously. Following a three pointer from senior Steven Spieth that pushed Brown’s lead to eight points with just over 11 minutes left on the clock, co-captain Siyani Chambers came back and hit a jumper from the elbow as the shot clock expired.
They would be the first two points of an 18-1 run that put the Crimson on top for good.
During the run the Bears would be held without a field goal for a period of nearly five minutes. Over that span, Chambers chipped in six of his 15, senior forward Zena Edosomwan added four points and a block and freshman Bryce Aiken and Justin Bassey each contributed a three to give Harvard the 87-74 win in Providence
For a Harvard squad that prides itself on its depth, its second period heroics came through impressive individual performances from players who entered the game off the bench—Aiken scored 18 of his game high 23 in the second half alone while Edosomwan added all of his eight points and nine rebounds in the same frame. Overall, Harvard’s bench outscored Brown’s 36-11.
“I thought our bench was the difference for us,” head coach Tommy Amaker said. “We’ve said it all along, if we have a good bench and good balance, then we like who we are as a team and I thought tonight it certainly played out that way.”
What ended as a late runaway win for the Crimson began as a much closer affair—through the first ten minutes of play, the two teams traded leads 12 times with neither leading by more than three over the same span.
After missing his first three shots of the night, freshman Seth Towns proved to be the difference maker for Harvard midway through the first—scoring 10 in a row at one point and 12 in the half, he gave Harvard its largest lead of the first period at five.
“Really I’ve gotta give all that credit to my teammates,” Towns said. “They were finding me in open spots and I was just trying to rebound and get on the offensive glass. Everybody else made it easier.”
For the Crimson, however, turnovers marred what was a strong shooting half, coughing up the ball 11 times in the first frame. The Crimson corrected this in the second half, however, only losing the ball three times in the last 20 minutes.
Despite the strong defense late, Harvard simply couldn’t slow down Spieth. He finished the game with 21 points (13 of which came in the second half), four rebounds, and four assists.
“[Speith’s] crafty, and he’s also a senior,” Amaker said. “He’s been around, he knows how to change pace and how to use angles, and how to draw fouls. That’s just experience and being a savvy, crafty player. He’s always been a very impressive player and tonight he was a guy that we were struggling to defend.”
For Harvard, it was perhaps its performance at the line that made the difference.
The Crimson went 23-of-24 from the charity stripe. After going into the bonus just over 10 minutes into the second half, 13 of Harvard’s last 28 points came at the line. Meanwhile, the Bears struggled at the stripe, going 18-of-29 on the game.
While Harvard has struggled in the past from the line, one of the strengths on Friday night was the ability to get its best shooters to the stripe. Aiken hit 7-of-7 from the line, while Chambers and freshmen Justin Bassey each added four. Meanwhile, freshman Chris Lewis and Edosomwan—two of the team’s worst free throw shooters—had none of the 24 attempts.
“It took us a while to get going but I think you know throughout the lead changes we just stayed consistent and we had to play Harvard basketball and that’s what we came out and did in the second half,” Aiken said. “We played hard, we got stops, played together, ball movement was much better, and we put the ball in the basket and we defended.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
All week, supporters of the Harvard men’s hockey team were left to wonder whether do-it-all goaltender Merrick Madsen would be healthy enough to suit up for the Crimson’s two biggest games of the year—beginning with this weekend's clash involving No. 6 Union.
When all was said and done, a missing netminder did play a critical role in Friday night’s battle of the ECAC’s best. It just wasn’t Madsen.
Rather, Union starter Alex Sakellaropoulos missed his third consecutive game with a lower-body injury, and Harvard pounded his replacement. The No. 4/5 Crimson scored four times in the first period and a half, chasing sophomore Jake Kupsky from his goal with 7:59 remaining in the middle frame. Two empty-netters later, Harvard closed the book on a 6-2 victory that temporarily moves the Crimson—a winner of five straight games—into first place in the ECAC.
Sophomore Ryan Donato stole the show with a four-goal outburst, becoming the first Harvard player to accomplish such a feat since Connor Morrison '13 in November 2009. The second-year forward launched a whopping 13 shots on goal in the contest, just six fewer than the rest of his team combined.

When asked by one reporter whether he realized how many attempts he had taken at the net, Donato simply smiled and said he had no idea.
“If that’s the case, I probably should have passed it a couple more times,” he laughed.
The sophomore scored once in the first, again in the second, and then added two empty-netters in the third to put a stamp on his career night. Donato now has two hat tricks as a member of the Crimson (17-5-2, 12-4-2 ECAC), and both were recorded against the Dutchmen (19-8-2, 12-4-1).
Donato’s second goal—a wrister from the outer edge of the right faceoff circle—was the first of three Harvard scores over a span of 4:17 that knocked Kupsky out of the game midway through the second frame. A far cry from Donato's first goal—the product of a fortuitous forecheck—the Scituate, Mass., native's shot from the circle sailed successfully through traffic to increase the Crimson’s lead to 2-0 at 7:44.
Four minutes later, fellow second-year Viktor Dombrovskiy launched a wrister of his own from the point that soared past Kupsky, who had been screened by co-captain Devin Tringale. And 23 seconds after that, senior Sean Malone escaped a defender low in the slot to bang home a feed from classmate Luke Esposito, upping Harvard’s advantage to 4-0.
In an attempt to stop the bleeding, Union called timeout and swapped out Kupsky for sophomore Joe Young, who stopped all 13 shots he saw in relief.
Backed by Young, the Dutchmen did begin to stage a comeback in the third, as Hobey Baker candidate Mike Vecchione and his linemate, Sebastian Vidmar, both found twine in the opening nine minutes of the final frame to cut the Crimson’s lead in half.
“We expected their team to come out full of fire in the third,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I don’t know if we handled it as well as we could’ve. I thought we turned the puck over kind of needlessly and gave them chances. They certainly have the weapons to get back in the game.”
But manning the crease for the 24th straight time this season, Madsen held his ground the rest of the way, making 17 saves in the period and 32 for the game to help secure the win for the Crimson.
After the game, Madsen and Ted Donato both credited Matt Whalen, Harvard's associate director of Sports Medicine, for working throughout the week to have the goaltender ready to roll Friday. Madsen had suffered a lower-body injury in the final seconds of Monday's Beanpot semifinals and missed at least one practice in the lead-up to Friday's game.
“All I was focused on this week was getting in here and every day putting in the hours I needed to get back to normal,” Madsen said. “I felt great out there. Didn’t even feel wrong. Nothing felt bad.”
Madsen made one of his biggest stops of the night when Union was on the power play trying to climb out of a 4-2 deficit with a little more than five minutes remaining. Junior Spencer Foo, who had a hand in both Dutchman goals when Union defeated Harvard 2-1 last month, ripped a shot towards the far post from the left faceoff circle that could have pulled the Dutchmen within one. But Madsen fully extended his left pad to make the stop, and the penalty expired shortly thereafter.
Union pulled its goaltender with 2:30 remaining in hopes of inching closer with an extra attacker, but Ryan Donato wound up finding the empty cage on two separate occasions—once with 2:16 left and again with 14 seconds remaining after the Dutchmen gained another power play.
In all, the Crimson penalty kill held Union 0-for-5 on man advantages—tied for its best statistical performance in league play this season.
The Dutchmen will have a chance to pull back into first place Saturday night against Dartmouth, but for the time being, Harvard now holds a one-point edge over both Union and No. 18 St. Lawrence. By Sunday, all three teams will have four conference games remaining.

Whether you have a special someone or you didn’t get that lucky this cuffing season, Palentine’s Day is a great time for everyone to leave the romance behind and embrace the authentic joy of friendship.
After all, Valentine’s Day is undoubtedly overrated—if you love someone, you shouldn’t just devote a single day to prove it. So if you were already dreading this coming Valentines’ Day (Read: Single People’s Awareness Day), fear not, because the possibilities for fun on the fourteenth are endless.
Write Palentine’s Day cards to your closest chums.
Palentine’s Day is all about celebrating the people you love and reminding them of all the reasons you admire them. So this Palentine’s Day, write a letter to your closest pals telling them how grateful you are for their presence in your life. Whether it’s through recounting dumb inside jokes from last semester, or sentimental memories from opening days, everyone likes feeling appreciated.
Netflix and Platonic Chill.
Whether you’re going for a traditional Galentine’s Day and choose to throw it down with the girls, or you wanna binge watch your favorite show with the guys, a casual Netflix and Chill accompanied by half-priced Valentine’s Day candy (which can be purchased with Crimson Cash, bless you CVS) is always a success. Rather than having to plan a stuffy, elaborate dinner with your S.O., movie nights are the perfect opportunity to unwind on the common room futon and enjoy the comfort of cuddling in companionable silence.
Wine/Whine Night.
Just because you and your friends aren’t a band of middle-aged moms doesn’t mean you can’t act as such. Sometimes the laid-back ease of movie night is too mundane, and you feel like observing this holiday in a more sophisticated setting. AKA, whining about your sorrows over unlimited wine and cheese. If you’re balling on a budget, Trader Joe’s is the place for you. With selections of wine ranging in price from $3-$9, a poor college student really can’t go wrong. Not to mention, their cheese varieties are superb. From their Vanilla-Blueberry Brie to their Jalapeño and Honey Gouda, Trader Joe’s is sure to make your Palentine’s Day unforgettable.
At the end of the day, you don’t really need extravagant plans to appreciate the company of your best pals. But this Valentine’s Day, don’t let the fact that you are single be a reason to sulk in your solitude and pine for your nonexistent cuddle buddy. Just because you don’t have romantic love in your life right now, doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy the other kinds of love that are all around you. So go stock up on discounted candy and cheap wine, and get ready to celebrate Palentine’s Day like never before.

Valentine’s Day is upon us and it seems that even the most obnoxious section kid has someone to snuggle with. If you’re one of the unfortunate singles who didn't follow the advice of Flyby’s cuffing season post, you might be trying to find a bae through...well, Tinder. While Tinder might be a fun way to pass time during a Mankiw Ec10 lecture (sorry not sorry), it’s also a decent way to find a suitable hottie to take out to the Instagram-chic Tatte on February 14th. However, Ivy League cuties aren't the only people you'll stumble upon during your search for love. Sometimes, you'll find yourself swiping on some pretty weird characters -- and no, not just that hot Yalie you accidentally superliked during the Game. Here are the top 5 quirky Tinder bachelors we stumbled upon during our search for hot singles in the area.
5) Lamp, 21 (less than a mile away)
Do you love how the standard Harvard-issued lamp spices up your dorm decor? Do you ever find yourself gently dimming its light to set the mood as you sweat over your pset at 3 a.m. on a Thursday night? Do you ever want to feel even closer to this tall dark beauty that is already so near your bed? All you lamp aficionados are in luck, as a lamp has been spotted on Tinder less than a mile away. 
4) Bacon, 18 (4 miles away)
You may have spotted this sizzling charmer in the dhall and felt an undeniable chemistry (not the organic kind). However, if the line for breakfast before a 10 a.m. lecture seems too long, you can always hit up this juicy piece of meat on Tinder with a “Hey baby” that it will never reply to.
3) Shrek, 18 (3 miles away)
SomeBODY once told me that ogres are not just green monsters and actually have a lot more layers than that guy from the PSK you took home last weekend. A true living legend, Shrek is sure to be an 'ogre' achiever in the swamp and definitely knows how to push your gumdrop buttons (in a good way). This Valentine's Day, let Shrek be your knight in shining armor...and don't deny that you've always wanted to touch his muffin, man.
2) Harambe, 21 (42 miles away)
If you spent your fall semester mourning Harambe even more than the 132 dollars you spent on Mankiw’s textbook, you’ll be delighted to find out that this celebrity may actually still be with us and (even better) looking for love. 42 miles is a long way, but love conquers all #CharlieCardsOutForHarambe.
1) The Harvard Turkey, 21 (860 miles away)
Who deserves the top spot of our list more than the most celebrated member of the Harvard community? Apparently finding love is on the Harvard Turkey’s agenda, along with posing for excited students and striking fear in children, squirrels and puzzled tourists. The 860 mile distance explains the recent disappearance of this beloved icon from our campus. A quick Google search shows that exactly 860 miles separate Boston from Brazil, so if you want a steamy date with an international sensation to escape the New England winter, swipe right!
