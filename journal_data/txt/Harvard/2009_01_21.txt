After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Having a little trouble cramming for your exam? If you’re a member of the Fox Club, or a number of other student groups, answers may only be a click away.
Some organizations, including the final clubs the Fox and the Spee, maintain study guide archives for their members, according to students in each of those clubs. 
Members of campus Greek organizations, including the Delta Gamma and Kappa Kappa Gamma sororities, have also been compiling collections of study guides, according to their members. 
Kappa Kappa Gamma, for example, hosts a Google group for members to upload and share study guides. 
Some student organizations, such as the Black Students Association, also organize study guide archives for their members.  “We had the good idea to use our Web site as a resource for students to study for finals,” said BSA president Timothy D. Turner ’09. 
The BSA archive was originally established in the 2006-07 school year by the president of the BSA at the time, according to Turner.
“We all knew that people had study guides lying around on their hard drives,” he said. “We wanted to put them in one place, so it could be a tremendous help to students studying for exams.”
Sarah C. Anoke ’09, BSA webmaster, said students e-mail her to submit study guides to be uploaded onto the Web site. The BSA Web site is open to all undergraduates, as long as they create an account on the Web site with an official Harvard e-mail.
“This is our first year with a fully functioning Web site,” Anoke said. “We’ve been collecting study guides for a few years now, so the library is pretty extensive.”
During this exam period, there has been “a really big boom of people creating accounts” on the BSA Web site, Anoke said. This January alone, more than 200 new usernames were created.
Kristin E. McNelis ’11, a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma, said there is not a problem with clubs archiving study guides for their members. 
“A lot of people organize study groups themselves with people in class,” she said. 
She added that a lot of students in these clubs share study guides with friends. “So it’s not that much of a disadvantage,” she said. 
Chelsea Connolly ’10 said that in general, she thinks that sharing study resources “shows very good cooperation between students” and “kind of bucks the cliche that Harvard is so competitive.” 
But Connolly added that she considers the selective sharing within social organizations “an unfair advantage.”

Internet safety for minors was the focus of a report released by the Berkman Center for Internet and Society last week.
This was the final report of the Internet Safety Technical Task Force, a group commissioned by MySpace and about 50 state attorney generals in February of last year, and which included 29 Internet companies, non-profit organizations and academics.
“Its purpose was to consider those technologies that industry and end users—including parents—can use to help keep minors safer on the Internet,” wrote Dena Sacco, a clinical fellow at the Berkman Center and co-director of the Task Force, in an e-mailed statement.
The task force looked at both dangers associated with the Internet—such as sexual solicitation and bullying—as well as various technologies used to prevent these problems, such as age and identity verification.
By conducting a literature review of past research, the report found that a lot of risks encountered by youth online are similar to those encountered offline.  The task force said that it is often the social circumstances of these minors and not the social networks themselves that facilitate these issues. 
“Those who are most at risk often engage in risky behaviors and have difficulties in other parts of their lives,” the report said, which also noted that some dangers for minors may not be as severe as normally perceived.
“I think some people were surprised that the data from existing studies show that while sexual predation on minors by adults remains a serious concern, cases typically involve post-pubescent minors who were aware they were meeting an adult male for purposes of sexual activity,” Sacco wrote. “Somewhat different than the more common image of an older male deceiving and preying on young child.” 
Some attorney generals were troubled by the report’s conclusions about the risks posed to youth. Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley, who last fall initiated “The Massachusetts Strategic Plan for Cyber Crime,” said in a press release that while she didn’t want to downplay the degree of risk posed by sexual predators, “we must remember that the Internet is an ever-changing and dynamic space.”
The effectiveness of 40 different technologies used to protect minors online, including filtering and auditing and text analysis, were also assessed by the task force. And while hopeful about future innovations, the task force emphasized not relying on technology alone to prevent these risks. They found that many of the technologies were “point solutions rather than broad attempts” to preventing these dangers.
The report concluded in recommending a combination of initiatives to address online dangers for youth, including technologies, parental oversight, social services, and law enforcement. Both Coakley and the Berkman Center emphasized the need for more research into how to combat online risks.
“Too little is known about the interplay among risks and the role that minors themselves play in contributing to unsafe environments,” the report said.

Harvard has contributed nearly $4.8 billion in economic activity to the greater Boston region in the 2008 fiscal year, according to a study released by the University last week.
The study emphasizes Harvard’s role as a benefactor to its local community in times of financial crisis. The University commissioned the 18-page report as an update to a similar 2004 study, said the report’s author Hugh O’Neill, founder and president of Appleseed, a New York consulting firm.
The study outlines the primary ways in which the institution contributes to the regional area and state: employment, local spending, research, and community outreach. The report is aimed at shining a light on how Harvard benefits the community beyond the perennially-  controversial Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT), which is about $5.6 million to Cambridge, Boston, and Watertown.
Today, Boston is forecasting a shortfall of $140 million, Mayor Thomas M. Menino said last week. The government is eyeing tax-exempt non-profits like educational institutions and hospitals to make up a portion of the difference.
City officials estimate that they could collect more money than is provided by the PILOTs if non-profits paid taxes. 
In the months since the close of the past fiscal year, Harvard’s endowment has dropped from $37 billion to $29 billion. But according to the report itself, universities like Harvard may be less affected by the current recession. 
For example, from 2000 to 2003, while the computer services sector shed 27 percent of its jobs in the Bay State, Massachusetts’ colleges and universities increased employment by 5.7 percent.
“There is a significant web of connections between the University and its host communities,” said Mary Power, Harvard’s chief of community relations. “Many [relationships] can be characterized in terms of dollars, but others reach into a quality of life and service impact—contributions of equal importance.”  
Among the report’s other findings include:
—Ninety percent of the University’s $3.5 billion in annual revenue came from outside the Boston area, but more than 70 percent of its $2.6 billion in spending went into the local five-county region.
—The University employed 18,750 full- and part-time employees, and it directly or indirectly supported 51,570 jobs in the region. 
—Harvard spent $850 million in goods and services and $580 million in construction or renovation projects with Boston companies. This economic activity contributed more than $225 million in revenues for the state and local governments.
—Harvard spent $660 million on externally-funded research. Compared to other institutions that his firm has analyzed, O’Neill said, “The clarity and sharpness of Harvard’s focus on areas of research critical for the future is unusual.”
—Harvard’s 20,000 undergraduate and graduate students created $349 million in revenue for the Boston area with off-campus spending in areas like food, transportation, and housing.
—More than 40,000 alumni, or 17.5 percent of those who live in the United States, resided in a 75-mile radius around Boston.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following the announcement that Crate and Barrel will shut its doors this weekend, Brattle Street is poised to lose two more businesses with the closing of cosmetics store Beauty and Main and business accessories store Cross. Beauty and Main closed its doors over a week ago after six years in Harvard Square. The store noticed a dramatic decline in sales over the past year and a half, according to director of operations Kate E. Richard. “We changed our staff and the structure of our products, but ultimately the number of people coming in the door was down by 49 percent,” Richard said. “Traffic just died out.” For the last four years, the space below Beauty and Main, which was located on the second floor of its Brattle Street location, had been vacant following a bookstore closing. This contributed to less people visiting the store, Richard said. She also cited bad weather, unreliable T service, and frequent protests as factors that have kept people from the store in recent years. Richard said there was also a loss of clientele. “For almost three years the store did very well with lots of students, professors, and a healthy mix of women of different ages with different needs,” she said. “It then dwindled down to more students and less reliable business.” Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said that while it was evident that Beauty and Main was struggling, Origins, located nearby, has similar products but has not faced the same problems. “I’m not sure if it’s marketing or location,” she said. “It was a store that just never really took off here in Harvard Square as one would expect.” Another store prepared to close by the end of this month is Cross, also located on Brattle Street. The store sold luxury business accessories for almost five years. Store manager Christopher H. Siren contributed its closing to “hard times.” The rent was too high for the store in Harvard Square to be maintained, Siren said. In order to pursue a less costly alternative, Cross is opening a kiosk in the Prudential Center to make up for this loss. “The general consensus from what I hear is that rent in Harvard Square is really high and even good businesses are struggling,” Siren said. But Jillson said that the HSBA has been receiving two to three inquiries a week about available store space, many from businesses owned by women in the area. The increasing presence of these small businesses proves that rent in the Square is reasonable, Jillson said. “Clearly, if locally-owned, independent businesses run by women are able to afford rent in prime locations, then one would conclude that rents are not skyrocketing,” she said. Jillson also said the store’s location could have contributed to its decline. “It was an inappropriate use of space, and [Cross’] closing came as no surprise,” she said. Currently, 78 percent of businesses surveyed by the Harvard Square Business Association are locally-owned. Sixteen percent are national chains, and 6 percent are regional companies. —Staff writer Emma R. Carron can be reached at ecarron@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Droves of applicants are jockeying for graduate school admission in hopes of avoiding the job crunch during this economic recession. But the nation’s top universities say that they are unable to open up more spots for Ph.D. students, since their hard-hit endowments cannot fund additional graduate student fellowships.
Stanford and Northwestern are even planning to reduce next year’s class size for their incoming Ph.D. students by 5 percent and 8 percent, respectively.
This reduction may last beyond the economic recession, according to the dean of Northwestern University’s graduate school, Andrew B. Wachtel ’81.
“This is in part due to immediate economic concerns (these students are expensive),” he wrote in an e-mailed statement, “but also to longer term questions about our ability to place these students if our peer universities decide to downsize faculty over the next few years and/or if our older colleagues decide not to retire.”
For Stanford, a reduction in Ph.D. students may deal a blow to the school. 
“The university just won’t be quite as productive,” said Richard P. Saller, Stanford’s dean of the School of Humanities and Sciences. 
Meanwhile, applications are piling up at the gates of these institutions.
Ph.D. applications have increased by 16 percent at Northwestern, 7 percent at Michigan, 8 percent at Dartmouth, and 12 percent at Johns Hopkins. Overall applications for graduate study—most of which are for Ph.D.s—are up by 15 percent at Duke, 9 percent at Dartmouth, 5 percent at Stanford, 9 percent at Yale, and 9.5 percent at Princeton, according to deans at those universities.
These increases are dramatically higher than the 3 percent average annual increase in graduate school applications over the last decade, noted in a 2007 report by the Council of Graduate Schools.
And these numbers are likely to mushroom next year.
Stuart Heiser, the Council of Graduate Schools’ manager of government relations and external affairs, wrote in an e-mail that the last recession in 2001 proved graduate school applications are “a lagging indicator of the economic cycle.”
Graduate school applications increased by 6 percent in 2001. But in the following year, they rose by 13 percent, Heiser said.
Despite the increased interest, most of the nation’s top graduate schools do not have the funds available to support expanded graduate programs. 
The graduate schools at Yale, Princeton, Cornell, the University of Pennsylvania, Johns Hopkins, Berkeley, Duke, the University of Virginia, the University of Michigan, UCLA, and Dartmouth will be accepting approximately the same number of students that they admitted last year, according to high-level officials at those schools.
MORE APPLICANTS, FEWER FUNDS
Harvard’s Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Allan M. Brandt declined to comment on application numbers and how the financial crisis might affect Ph.D. admissions.
Although Princeton is increasing funds for graduate student fellowships by 3 percent to help students cope with the financial crisis—Princeton’s endowment has been relatively less hard-hit than Harvard’s, losing 11 percent of its value as Harvard lost 22 percent—next year’s Ph.D. class size will remain the same, according to the university’s graduate school associate dean, David N. Redman.
As the number of Ph.D. applicants rises, the popularity of masters degree programs remains uncertain.
The associate dean of graduate academic programs and research at the University of Virginia’s Graduate School of the Arts and Sciences, Aaron L. Mills, surmised that the financial crisis may reduce the number of masters degree applicants, even as the Ph.D. applications flow in.
“Because most of our terminal masters people are unsupported,” he wrote in an e-mailed statement, “it may be that the economy would reduce the affordability of graduate education.” 
Wachtel, the dean at Northwestern, wrote that if masters degree applicants cannot find loans, then the number of masters students may decline. But in areas where students would view a masters degree as a wise long-term investment, graduate school may appear as “a temporary ‘safe haven,’” Wachtel wrote.
While most masters degree students receive little financial aid, most Ph.D. programs at selective private research universities fully fund students for the first five years.
Many of the nation’s top graduate schools say that they remain committed to meeting current students’ financial needs.
“We are determined to uphold our commitment to existing Ph.D. students; that is to guarantee full funding for the first five years of their program,” said Jo Rae Wright, the dean of Duke’s graduate school, in an e-mailed statement. “Our primary allegiance is, of course, to our current students.”
Harvard students who applied to graduate school this year said these concerns may well bear on their future plans.
Lin Cong ’09, who applied to Ph.D. programs in physics and economics, said that he would need to rely almost entirely on a university for funding. Since he is an international student and therefore does not qualify for most fellowships, Cong said financial aid offerings will be important in his choice of school.
B. Robert Owens ’09, who applied to several Ph.D. programs in intellectual history, said that if he is accepted to one of his ideal graduate schools, he would not be deterred by a reduced financial aid package. He added that if the acceptance letters don’t arrive, he might spend a year or two as a high school teacher or a librarian.

Harvard Medical School Dean Jeffrey S. Flier announced Thursday that the school will embark on a review of its conflict of interest policy in conjunction with Harvard’s ongoing efforts to develop University-wide recommendations and guidelines.
The 19-member committee—which, for the first time, includes students—is charged with reviewing the existing policy and revamping the current process for disclosing financial interests and industry ties. The last review took place in 2004.
“It’s time for it,” Gretchen A. Brodnicki, the school’s dean for faculty and research integrity, said yesterday. “This is a living document of a policy that was always intended to be reviewed periodically.”
Brodnicki added that the school has been reviewing its conflict of interest policy every few years since the policy’s inception in 1990.
The formation of the school-wide committee, which will function as a subcommittee of the University-wide review, comes as conflict of interest issues have received national scrutiny. (The Harvard-wide review is being led by David Korn ’54, a former dean of Stanford Medical School who is occupying the newly-created position of vice provost for research.)
Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican and the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, reported last June that psychiatrist Joseph Biederman of Harvard-affiliated Mass. General Hospital received $1.6 million in consulting and speaking fees from the makers of drugs that he used to treat children for bipolar disorders. 
Grassley later accused psychiatrists at Stanford and Emory of failing to disclose industry ties, such as $6 million worth of stock in a drug company and payments totaling $500,000 from pharmaceutical companies. Grassley has also sponsored legislation that would mandate the disclosure of financial ties between physicians and industry. 
At the Medical School, students rallied in October to codify disclosure policies in the classroom and push for more comprehensive conflict of interest policies across the school and its affiliated hospitals. The teaching hospitals are independent and operate under their own charters, and each has its own conflict of interest policies.
Mark L. Zeidel, a Medical School professor on the committee, said he believes that standardizing conflict of interest policies across the hospitals would be a step in the right direction.
“My hope is we come up with a single code of conduct for the school and its hospitals,” said Zeidel, who works at Harvard-affliated Beth Israel.
Brodnicki declined to comment further on specific issues the committee would take on, but added that the group would look to streamline the process for reporting industry ties.
Medical School professor Peter Sorger, who is also a member of the committee, said that faculty members could conceivably be filling out disclosure forms several times a month—every time they submit grant proposals in addition to annual updates.
“I don’t think public disclosure is enough, but I do think it’s a necessary step,” Sorger said, noting that the need for more than just disclosure is recognized in the current policy. 
He added that the committee aims to strengthen existing policies and consider other steps to ensure fair industry-related practices.
Though the Medical School’s panel has yet to meet, the committee will almost certainly update existing policies to comply with a Massachusetts law signed in August that requires pharmaceutical and medical device-making firms to publicly disclose gifts worth more than $50.
“Our policy currently doesn’t cover or restrict gifts,” Brodnicki said. “That’s something that will certainly be a topic for this group’s discussion.”
Brodnicki said that the Medical School doesn’t have “any timeline” for finishing the review. 
“It doesn’t make sense to say we’re going to hurry out a recommendation in X number of months,” she said, “it’s more important that we get this right.”
Past reviews have usually taken between several months and a year to complete.
The final policy developed by the Medical School committee will be reviewed by the school’s Faculty Council and will then be submitted to the University-wide team for approval.

Judith R. Dortz, a retired administrator who has proctored Harvard exams for several semesters, said that during the three-hour finals, “you can only sit and stare at a wall for so long.” She admitted to glancing at exams before passing them out or working on a crossword puzzle occasionally during her breaks to avoid boredom.
The so-called “geriocracy,” which proctor Judith R. Dortz likened to an Elderhostel program, is mostly composed of experienced retirees recruited by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Final Examinations Office. Although most have some background in education, proctors come from varied walks of life. 
Anne Conneely and Beryl Noble, proctors of a psychology exam held yesterday, said that proctoring allowed them to meet different and interesting people who are not necessarily affiliated with the University. Conneely, calling herself a less-typical proctor, said that she learned about the opportunity through a friend of her mother and decided to take on the job part-time to earn some extra money in this economy. 
“There is a certain camaraderie among proctors,” Dortz said. “Over the years, you encounter the same people and develop quick relationships with the other proctors.” 
Joseph G. Pike worked in the Massachusetts Department of Public Health before he took an interest in proctoring. Pike said that one of the most important tasks of proctors is to promote fairness by enforcing the designated start and finish times of the exam and monitor test-takers for cheating. “A proctor should regulate the examination environment to make sure that the experience is the same for each student,” he said. 
The duties of a proctor range from the mundane to more serious administrative responsibilities. The practical measures can include requesting that the University adjust the temperature of the room or halt distracting yard work such as snow blowing, Pike said. 
At other times, proctors are called upon to ensure that the health of the students is not compromised during test-taking, as in the case of the young woman who lost consciousness during a Life Sciences 1a exam, he added. 
Pike said that proctoring small classes, those with 50 or fewer students, is usually less stressful than monitoring exams featuring several exam booklets or exam sessions in which multiple small classes are proctored at the same time. 
Some students said that although they find proctors helpful, proctors can’t replace TFs. 
“My proctors have generally been responsible and are on your side, but I really appreciate it when course heads have TFs there as well to answer course-specific questions,” Ellora B. Berthet ’10 said.

WASHINGTON—Barack Hussein Obama was inaugurated as the 44th president of the United States yesterday before a record crowd of onlookers, taking his place in history as the first black commander-in-chief while calling on Americans to join together to confront the deepening financial crisis. 
Obama, a 1991 graduate of Harvard Law School, took the oath of office just after noon on a chilly and crowded day in the nation’s capital.
“With hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents, and endure what storms may come,” Obama told a crowd of well over one million people who packed the National Mall to witness the inauguration.
“Let it be said by our children’s children that when we were tested, we refused to let this journey end,” Obama said during his inauguration speech, which lasted about 20 minutes.
Obama was sworn in by Chief Justice John G. Roberts ’76, a fellow Harvard Law graduate.
Obama and Roberts, both of whom were high-ranking editors on the Harvard Law Review, provided one of the lone gaffes of the day by botching the wording of the oath: Roberts twice recited the worth “faithfully” out of order, causing Obama to pause momentarily before he too recited the oath with the word out of place.
The inauguration was studded with former Harvard luminaries, as Obama was joined on the Capitol steps by former University President Lawrence H. Summers and former Vice President Al Gore ’69.
Obama began his speech by continuing the bipartisan tone of his two and-a-half month transition, congratulating former President George W. Bush for “the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition.”
But he quickly pivoted to address the rising number of jobs lost in a flagging economy, asking the crowd to look forward by deferring to the resilience shown by Americans in the past.
“Our challenges may be new, the instruments with which we meet them may be new, but those values upon which our success depends—honesty and hard work, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism—these things are old,” Obama said.
Obama stressed support for countries in need and retribution for terrorist foes who intend to harm Americans.
“For those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken,” Obama said. “You cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you.”
“To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict or blame their society’s ills on the West, know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy,” he added.
After the ceremony, and before he embarked on the ceremonial parade from the Capitol to the White House, Obama attended a traditional congressional luncheon in Statuary Hall of the Capitol building.
The event turned somber when Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56 reportedly suffered a seizure and was taken to nearby Washington Hospital. 
Kennedy was reported to be in good spirits, though he was expected to stay in the hospital overnight.
The Obamas concluded the evening by attending 10 official inauguration balls, with the new president giving a speech and the first couple dancing at each one.

An envelope containing unidentified white powder was delivered to the office of Harvard Law Professor Alan M. Dershowitz on the fifth floor of the Law School's Hauser Hall this morning.
His assistant, Sarah Neely, noticed small white specks falling onto her desk as she slit open the envelope, which had “Alan” scrawled on the flap and contained a blank thank-you card.
“I had it all over my hands—the whole envelope was full of it,” Neely said.
Authorities have determined that the powder tested negative for anthrax, and an e-mail sent to the law school community said "there is no indication that the material is hazardous." But authorities will not be able to confirm the powder's chemical makeup for another few days, when final lab results are in, Neely said.
Thirteen envelopes—which contained a similar white powder and also bore a postmark from Knoxville, Tenn.—were received at the Wall Street Journal's headquarters in New York this morning, according to numerous media reports. The Journal published an opinion piece on Jan. 2 in which Dershowitz, who is one of Israel’s most prominent defenders, supported Israel’s military actions in Gaza.
Dershowitz receives hate mail on a daily basis; his office is the only one at the Law School with bulletproof windows, Neely added.
“I sort of made a joke about it at first—the hate mail we get is pretty ridiculous,” Neely said, explaining that she often fields calls from people telling Dershowitz that he will “rot in hell.”
But once she and her coworkers realized that the powder might constitute a serious threat to her safety, she immediately contacted the University police. Within the hour, the Cambridge police and fire departments along with the University’s Environmental Health and Safety team had arrived and sealed off the fifth floor.
When Neely got off the phone with Dershowitz—who is on sabbatical and currently off campus—Dershowitz immediately contacted the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation with his concerns, Neely said.
Two years ago, Neely said that Dershowitz received a life-threatening message, and FBI escorts trailed him for the following week to ensure his safety.
In an e-mail sent to the Law School community yesterday afternoon, Dean for Administration Francis X. McCrossan requested that “anyone intending to study or conduct business in Hauser not do so until further notice.”
Classes held in the building for the day were also rescheduled.
McCrossan wrote in a second e-mail this evening that law enforcement authorities have cleared the building for re-entry tomorrow at 7 a.m.

Winthrop House Masters Stephen P. Rosen and Mandana Sassanfar announced that they will be stepping down at the end of this academic year, in an e-mail to the House community earlier today. 
Rosen and Sasssanfar have held the posts for six years. They cited personal reasons for the decision. 
They are the second set of Masters to announce their intention to leave their posts in recent months, following Pforzheimer House's Sue and James J. McCarthy in November.
