After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s a terrible feeling to be approaching graduating from Harvard with my field worse off than I found it. As a first-year, I was thrilled by the 2018 creation of the secondary in Educational Studies. I walked a newly constructed pathway into education. I took General Education 1076: Equity and Excellence in American K-12 Education (then USW 35), pursued the Ed secondary, and joined the Harvard Teacher Fellows, through which I will teach English next year. Now, as a senior, I’m devastated to see that bridge collapsed behind me.
The College has chosen not to renew Gen Ed 1076 for the 2021-22 school year. This decision stifles the Ed secondary, devalues education as an academic and professional path, and ignores an unprecedented outpouring of support. Harvard must reverse this decision and affirm its commitment to education.
There are two key issues here. First, the College’s messaging has been inconsistent and misleading. Second, the deferral of Gen Ed 1076 disregards that course’s centrality to the Ed secondary — and deepens a lack of institutional support for the study of education.
News of the course’s non-renewal caught fire, eliciting a 988-signature, 72-page petition for reinstatement. Nina B. Elkadi ’22, Allison P. Pao ’21, and I emailed this petition to the administration asking to meet. Dealt an initial dismissal, we pointed out their inconsistencies.
The Gen Ed Committee originally referenced the University’s tightening belt: “Our budget is very constrained.” Later, College spokesperson Rachael Dane asserted a “two-year rotation” for non-Faculty of Arts and Sciences Gen Eds. College Dean Rakesh Khurana echoed a similar refrain: “We do anticipate that all non-FAS lead Gen Ed courses will need to be offered on a rotational basis going forward.”
There is no current evidence that any class besides Gen Ed 1076 has been placed on rotation. Of 89 total Gen Eds in 2020-21, we reached out to the 19 courses taught by non-FAS faculty. Eight confirmed that they will repeat in 2021-22. Only three courses are confirmed not to run next year. One professor is on sabbatical, another will likely serve the Biden administration. The third is Gen Ed 1076.
Is this rotation being applied to all non-FAS Gen Ed courses, or just Gen Ed 1076? What do “anticipate” and “going forward” mean for 2021-22? The administration could easily issue a public clarification. It hasn’t. Gen Ed 1076 seems to be the only course that has been deferred next year, and we have a right to know why.
This deferral undercuts Harvard’s already-weak infrastructure for the study of education. Multiple signers of the petition referenced a stigma against using their Harvard degree to enter the field. Maybe that’s part of why 45 percent of Harvard’s Class of 2020 is pursuing careers in finance and consulting, while only two percent began careers in education. And that is with Gen Ed 1076 in place.
The course is utterly central to the Ed secondary. Among the graduating classes of 2019-22, 60 of 73 Ed secondary students (82 percent) have taken Gen Ed 1076. Can the College name a single non-mandatory course that is equally central to another secondary? Deferring this course cuts the Ed secondary off at its roots.
Dean Khurana pledged an “ongoing commitment to providing courses, experiences, and opportunities in education.” That has to be backed up by action. At a minimum, Harvard should commit to replacing this course with another on K-12 education. We asked for this commitment, more than once, and received no acknowledgment. Without Gen Ed 1076, even fewer undergraduates will enter education at a time when they are gravely needed.
It cannot be lost that I am writing as thousands of Harvard students are in the midst of a mandatory lockdown. Class has been online for nearly a year. Between one to three million K-12 students are estimated to have not attended school since March — in the U.S. alone. UNICEF has warned of a lost generation of students. Now is the time to reinforce courses like Gen Ed 1076.
There are so many levels of irony to the College’s response.
In an educational emergency, they are undermining the study of education. In the same year that it received a record 57,000 applications, the College is eliminating the only course that asks undergraduates to reflect on “Equity and Excellence in American K-12 Education.” Amid a reckoning with racism, they are torching a developing pathway into social justice work. In a national moment of accountability, they don’t seem to be telling the truth.
After Gen Ed 1076’s announced cancellation, Kia C. Turner ’16, who graduated from the Harvard Graduate School of Education in 2017, wrote to the administration. “I became a teacher because this class convinced me that education was the justice issue of my generation and that I could make a difference by using my Harvard education to reimagine schools and classrooms that hold, lift, and support Black and Brown students like me.” In response, Turner received the same email response that our petition did from Dean Khurana — word for word.
Copying and pasting could mean one of two things. The College either did not read and take seriously the petition. Or their story of a non-FAS rotation is so fragile it must be held together word by word.
Is Ctrl+C an appropriate response to a 988-signature petition for a course that has over-lotteried and received glowing reviews for a decade? With testimonials from generations of students? With alumni representation from 1960 to the present? With support from tenured professors, varsity coaches, and resident deans?
On Thursday, a high school student told our Harvard Teacher Fellows cohort that his worst teacher was a “brick wall” who ignored students. I would like to believe this administration is not a brick wall. Dean Khurana and Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda Claybaugh are set to meet with us this week; the Gen Ed Committee has so far declined a meeting.
Gen Ed 1076 offers the College an opportunity to heed an unprecedented surge of student advocacy, affirm the value of education, and restore a crucial pathway into public service. I hope they take it.

Harvard purchased four fully electric shuttle buses to curb its use of fossil fuels on campus, according to a Tuesday press release from Campus Services.
Proterra — an electric vehicle technology manufacturing company — will provide the buses, which are expected to be operational this fall. They will replace four bio-diesel powered buses currently in use, which represent more than thirty percent of Harvard’s bus fleet. The University will also invest in the necessary electric charging infrastructure to support the new buses, per the statement.
The purchase is part of an “aggressive effort” to advance climate change solutions, improve public health, and make progress toward Harvard’s goal of becoming fossil fuel-neutral by 2026 and fossil fuel-free by 2050, according to the press release.
“This is a transformational project that can have a tremendously positive impact in the community and demonstrates our latest commitment to sustainable transportation,” Managing Director of Transportation Services John W. Nolan said in the release.
Harvard’s shuttle bus fleet transports approximately 600,000 students every year across its campuses. The shift to electric buses is expected to lead to an annual reduction of 220,462 pounds of greenhouse gas emissions as well as “two key air pollutants” known to be harmful: 0.013 metric tons of harmful particulate matter and 0.752 metric tons of nitrogen oxides.
The statement also argued the buses will not only cut emissions, but “create less air and noise pollution,” in order to benefit neighborhoods surrounding Harvard’s campuses.
The project is being funded by a Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection grant program, which is supporting nearly 100 similar projects across the Commonwealth with aims to “electrify the transportation sector.” The Harvard Green Revolving Fund will also provide a loan for Harvard to invest in charging infrastructure.
Recently, Harvard joined MassEVolves, an initiative that supports Massachusetts organizations that use zero-emission vehicles for their operations. As a participant in the initiative, Harvard pledged to implement a zero-emission vehicle action plan, including steps such as replacing bio-diesel powered buses with 100 percent electric ones.
“Investing in electric buses will have a positive impact on the health of people on our campuses and in the Cambridge and Boston area,” Managing Director of the Harvard Office for Sustainability Heather A. Henriksen said in the press release. “Harvard hopes to be a catalyst for other universities, businesses, and cities by piloting the transition to electric buses which contributes social, health, and climate benefits while being cost effective.”

Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen said during a faculty meeting Tuesday that the University has nearly completed vaccinating all Harvard affiliates eligible to receive the Covid-19 vaccine in Phase One of Massachusetts’ distribution plan.
Harvard is prepared to begin Phase Two vaccinations — which include individuals ages 75 and older, per state guidelines — once the University receives more shipments of the vaccine from the state, Nguyen said.
“There is some level of communication with the state, but we have not been able to get as much detail from them as we would like,” Nguyen said. “But I know that in recent communication with them, they could not give as much vaccines as they would like to give.”
Nguyen said during the meeting that the University is primarily distributing Moderna vaccines at this time, but it is prepared to receive Pfizer vaccines, which could be stored in ultra-cold freezer space at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Nguyen also said he would be comfortable distributing other vaccines as well, including those manufactured by Novavax or Johnson and Johnson.
“The vast majority of flu shots are only 40 to 60 percent effective,” Nguyen said. “So if we look at those other vaccines, it’s still really effective and I would be pleased with any of them.”
Nguyen also said HUHS has settled on two or three locations it is "likely" to use for large-scale immunization. Vaccinations will likely continue to require scheduled appointments throughout the entire rollout to prevent waste, he added.
“Every time we open a vial, we have to use every last drop,” Nguyen said.
Though the United States has prioritized the vaccination of high-risk individuals, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 said at the meeting that people's refusal to get the vaccine impedes nationwide inoculation efforts.
“There was only a 60 percent acceptance rate among healthcare workers,” Garber said, referring to vaccine acceptance by workers at university-affiliated hospitals across the country. “It’s very important when you are offered the vaccine, and people you work with are offered the vaccine, to encourage them to accept it.”
Garber also said Harvard currently does not have a timeline for lifting the travel restrictions it imposed as a result of the pandemic.
“It might be premature to talk about ‘when,’ when we don’t yet know what the status of vaccine distribution will be,” he said.
Although the University’s vaccine distribution plan is now underway, Nguyen said Harvard affiliates must continue to adhere to public health guidelines such as masking, social distancing, and handwashing.
Nguyen commended undergraduate students who returned to campus this spring for their diligence in following public health guidelines prior to arrival, citing only nine positive cases within the student move-in group.
“We were prepared for a lot more, but we were pleased,” Nguyen said. “That was a testament to the students being really careful in the weeks before move-in.”
Also during Tuesday’s meeting, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean Emma Dench presented a report by GSAS’s “Scholarship Restart” task force, which has been working since the fall semester to improve resources available to graduate students. In the fall, the task force received survey responses from nearly half of all GSAS students.
“It won’t be a surprise to anybody here that graduate students are unfortunately facing delays in their academic progress,” Dench said.
Graduate students expressed a need for quiet spaces on campus and access to printers, among other requests, according to Dench. GSAS administrators plan to work over the coming weeks to expand access.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay, who also addressed faculty on Tuesday, said the Office of Undergraduate Education remains on track to pilot some limited in-person teaching during the spring semester. According to Gay, these “experiments” with in-person learning — primarily for courses with laboratory, interactive lecture, or seminar components — will serve as preparation for fall 2021, when public health guidelines related to Covid-19 may still be in place.
Faculty have until Feb. 12 to notify the OUE of their intent to participate in the pilot.
“We have to prepare for the possibility, however unlikely, that some public health restrictions would still be in place in the fall,” Gay said. “For that, we need to start the process now of how to do that safely and effectively.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Lawrence S. Bacow defended the importance of free speech on campus during a faculty meeting Tuesday, but said that Harvard programs appointing individuals to an official role should “be prepared to defend why an individual is worthy of recognition” by Harvard.
Bacow’s remarks come amid calls for the University to take action to disassociate from political figures who sought to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Multiple petitions have demanded Harvard develop guidelines barring political figures who helped incite violence at the Capitol on Jan. 6 from holding official positions.
In his address Tuesday, Bacow denounced the riot as “a disgraceful act of insurrection.” Still, he defended the University’s commitment to inviting speakers of all backgrounds and perspectives to campus.
“An invitation to speak at Harvard is not an endorsement of the speaker or their ideas — quite the opposite,” he said. “Anyone who speaks on our campus must answer questions and is expected to engage in the kind of civil dialogue we hope to see in the wider world.”
Individuals appointed to positions on campus including lecture positions and prestigious fellowships, though, should be held to higher standards and require “greater consideration,” Bacow said.
He also rejected calls for the University to rescind degrees previously conferred, denying a petition that called for him to do so for individuals who helped incite the Capitol riot.
“A Harvard degree is not conferred on the condition of future good behavior,” Bacow said. “We should expect that our alumni will be as intellectually rigorous in their careers as they were in their studies. Those who fail to meet this standard will be judged in the court of public opinion, not by Harvard.”
Though Bacow said it is not Harvard’s job to judge its alums, he defended the Harvard Kennedy School’s decision to remove U.S. Representative Elise M. Stefanik ’06 (R-N.Y.) from the Institute of Politics’s Senior Advisory Committee after she challenged the certification of President Joe Biden’s Electoral College win and promoted unfounded claims of voter fraud.
“These unfounded assertions helped to undermine the electoral process,” Bacow said. “This made the Congresswoman’s position as an adviser to an organization dedicated to promoting undergraduate engagement with that same electoral process untenable.”
Jacob R. Carrel ’16, an author of the petition signed by nearly 700 affiliates calling for Stefanik’s removal from IOP leadership, wrote in an email Tuesday that Stefanik’s actions failed to “advance any real ideas.”
“Institutions can and should promote academic freedom, but doing so effectively requires giving a platform to those who disagree in good faith and based on facts, not those who traffic in lies for personal gain,” Carrel wrote.
Diego A. Garcia Blum — a Kennedy School student who started a petition in November calling on Harvard to develop “accountability guidelines” for welcoming former Trump administration officials — said Bacow’s remarks left him “optimistic” about how the school will act going forward.
“It is important for an institution like Harvard — that has the motto Veritas — to really make a stand for the principles it says that it values,” he said. “What I heard today from the remarks was heartening in that it seems that President Bacow is willing to stand for those.”
Values such as academic freedom and free speech play an important role in the University’s mission to educate the next generation of leaders, Bacow said. He said Harvard should provide an environment in which all affiliates feel free to speak their minds, expand their thinking, and engage with others who hold opposing views.
“We are better served by sharpening our arguments and strengthening our resolve than by distancing ourselves from those with whom we disagree,” Bacow said. “The defense of free and honest inquiry in the unfettered pursuit of truth is our shared responsibility—and among our most sacred commitments.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Feb. 3, 2021 at 11:50 a.m.
The David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies at Harvard, in partnership with its regional office in Chile, launched an academic forum in December to examine the rewriting and potential adoption of a new constitution in Chile.
The forum follows a national referendum that occurred in Chile on Oct. 25, 2020, catalyzed by widespread protests. In the October vote, nearly 80 percent of voters supported writing a new constitution that would replace the one written by former dictator Augusto Pinochet in 1980.
Though preparatory efforts for the Rockefeller Center’s “Academic Forum for the New Constitution in Chile” began in September 2019, it officially launched with a webinar on Dec. 2, 2020.
Manuel J. Ossa Hurtado, president of Harvard Association of Chilean Students and member of the academic forum’s advisory committee, said the redrafting of the Chilean constitution is a historic process that will allow Chileans to “crystallize and make permanent” the values they desire to see reflected in their government.
“It’s a very big responsibility. And we think it’s a very important opportunity for Chileans to imagine the country that we see in 20, 30, 50, 100 years from now,” he said.
Government professor Steven R. Levitsky, who helms the Rockefeller Center, said Harvard’s platform provides an opportunity to bring together opposing political parties during a polarized time.
“We have the ability to bring together people from across the political spectrum in a way that not everybody can,” he said.
Another member of the new academic forum’s advisory committee, Cristián R. Chiffelle, who formerly served as head of trade and investment policy at the World Economic Forum, said he hopes the forum will allow people to apply lessons from Chile’s rewriting process to challenges facing their own countries.
“If Chile manages to — without violence — actually draft a new constitution through democratic means as is being done, this is going to be an experience that’s going to be super valuable for other countries,” he said. “So I think it’s both an input, which we can get from the Harvard academic community, but also definitely an output that we would like to bring through the duration of the forum.”
Chiffelle added that the Center’s forum will be a dynamic, continuous process that tracks the rewriting of the Chilean constitution through its various political stages.
“We’re really thinking at least a two or three year process, which is going to take the constitutional discussion, the elections, the drafting of the constitution, and once the constitution is in place, when it starts getting implemented,” he said. “The forum really wants to go through all those steps.”
Levitsky posited that Chile’s constitutional reform will have more “teeth” than similar processes undergone by its Latin American counterparts. Bolivia and Ecuador, for instance, have each averaged one constitution a decade for the past 200 years, according to Levitsky.
“In some countries in the region, constitutions are rewritten all the time,” he said. “But they’re not taken very seriously. They’re effectively scraps of paper. They’re documents that everyone knows is only going to last a decade or so.”
Levitsky said he believes the United States — whose constitution has remained largely unchanged since its inception — would benefit from tracking Chilean reforms.
“We, the United States, are under the impression that what was written in the 18th century was somehow handed down from God and needs to be treated as sacred and never changed — that’s ridiculous,” he said. “Texts change; societies change.”
“The needs of a society in one century are likely to be somewhat different from the needs of a society in a quarter century, so Americans also need to think about constitutional reform,” Levitsky said. “I think there are things we can learn from Chile.”
CORRECTION: Feb. 3, 2021
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that nearly 80 percent of Chileans voted for a new constitution in a October 2020 referendum. In fact, nearly 80 percent of those who voted supported the new constitution.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Researchers at Harvard Law School’s Cyberlaw Clinic and International Human Rights Clinic collaborated with three human rights organizations based in Myanmar to produce a study on internet restrictions in Myanmar and Bangladesh, according to a white paper the groups published last month.
The report highlights similarities in the impacts of internet shutdowns in both countries — including limited access to education and Covid-19 guidance. It also determined differences in how a lack of internet access influences work, access to healthcare, and physical security in both nations.
“What is unique about this report is that it looks at both sides of the border — it looks at Myanmar and Bangladesh,” said Cyberlaw Clinic assistant director Jessica Fjeld, who led the drafting of the report along with International Human Rights Clinic lecturer Yee Htun.
“We were able to report on the impacts of internet shutdowns in the voices of the people who were impacted by them,” Fjeld added.
The paper is structured around 16 interviews with refugees in Bangladesh and internally displaced persons throughout Myanmar, and was conducted by the partner organizations Athan, Kintha Peace and Development Initiative, and the Rohingya Youth Association.
The report was published just before a military coup and declaration of a state of emergency in Myanmar — events touched off by the National League for Democracy's general election victory in November 2020. The opposition in the election claimed fraud and demanded a rerun of the vote.
Aung San Suu Kyi — the National League for Democracy's founder and Nobel Peace Prize laureate — and various members of the Myanmar parliament are believed to be under house arrest, a controversial move that has sparked international outcry.
The ongoing shutdowns in townships across Myanmar have lasted over a year, while shutdowns in refugee camps in Bangladesh lasted for 11 months. While 2G cellular connectivity was temporarily restored following international pressure, 2G generally does not permit online access to video calls, emails, photos, videos, or social media.
The lack of internet connectivity impedes populations across Myanmar and Bangladesh from accessing the “basic needs of life,” such as education, work, healthcare, free expression, and access to reliable information, according to the paper.
“For displaced people and those in conflict situations, the internet can function as a literal lifeline, and for this vulnerable population, it is a lifeline that has all too often been cut off,” the paper reads.
The paper studies how internet shutdowns dovetailed with the coronavirus pandemic to undermine people's access to vital healthcare information.
The internet also importantly provides people in Myanmar and Bangladesh access to education more broadly, per Fjeld.
“The Rohingya were prohibited from secondary education — they were only educated up to primary school in Myanmar, and then denied access to public schools after that — so many of them are studying English or other subjects through courses online, and they lost access to those courses when they lost access to the internet,” Fjeld said.
“The Internet is our university," one of the interviewees cited in the report said.
Fjeld said she thinks the report will be “more relevant than ever” in light of the military coup in Myanmar.
“I think internet shutdowns are going to be a piece of the authoritarian strategy that they are employing,” Fjeld said. “And so the report and the impacts that the report identifies will be more relevant than ever.”
Though temporary internet usage could allow for greater access to news, jobs, and communication with friends and family, Fjeld said it may not be enough to guarantee freedom of expression given the aggressive acts imposed by the govenment to silence its critics.
The researchers concluded the paper by calling on the governments of Myanmar and Bangladesh to reinstate internet connectivity for their respective populations.
“It is within the power of the Myanmar government to ease the devastating impacts on the affected population, restoring protections for their rights, by lifting the shutdown order, and the Bangladesh government must continue to guarantee network access,” the paper reads. “If the internet is not available, these vulnerable communities’ lives and suffering will persist in a perpetual state of lockdown and shutdown.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard representatives outlined the University’s sustainability, diversity and inclusion, and resident outreach initiatives during the annual Town Gown report to the Cambridge Planning Board Tuesday.
Harvard — along with Lesley University, Hult International School of Business, and MIT — annually submits a “Town Gown” report to the City of Cambridge and presents it to city representatives.
“Town Gown” refers to the partnership between the academic “gown,” and non-academic “town” areas of cities that house higher educational campuses.
“This year’s Town Gown report acknowledges the broad effects the pandemic has had on our institution, while also recognizing Harvard’s ongoing commitment to academic and research excellence, and to being a good neighbor,” Harvard’s report reads.
The report describes the University’s pandemic planning efforts as “conservative,” and states that all of Harvard's operations were “consistent with the latest health guidance” from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Thomas J. Lucey, Harvard Public Affairs and Communications's director of government and community relations for Cambridge, said Harvard reaffirmed its commitment to continuing academic initiatives and aiding residents outside the confines of the Cambridge campus.
“Support took many forms,” Lucey said. “We also made significant financial contributions to local nonprofits on the frontlines of responding to the crisis such as Food for Free and the Cambridge Community Center.”
“We have and will continue to support our small and independent retail and restaurants that are Harvard tenants by providing them with rent relief,” he added.
Lucey also said the University worked with the Cambridge Public Schools system to support local students struggling to learn during the pandemic.
“Harvard quickly developed and delivered new and adaptive programs and distributed digital resources that families, students, and educators can use to support online learning,” he said.
Though Cambridge Planning Board member Tom Sieniewicz praised Harvard and MIT for their thorough reports, he called on both universities to leverage their purchasing power to promote diversity and inclusion and “change the business climate” in the city.
“I wonder if there’s some way that you could work together with your sister institutions in the city to steer those dollars to underrepresented business enterprises, to Black-owned business enterprises,” he said.
Harvard Chief Sustainability Officer Heather A. Henriksen said during the meeting that Harvard purchased electric buses and invested in electric bus infrastructure that will be implemented later this year, calling this move a “big step” toward the University’s goal to become fossil-fuel free by 2050.
“We’re delighted to model this pathway, and we really hope we can talk to people and get them to join us,” Henriksen said. “We’re really excited, again, to draw attention to the local health benefits that this shift will be making for us on our journey to 2050.”
Henriksen also said she thinks it is important to take a “holistic” approach to environmental sustainability to ensure decisions are beneficial for environmental efforts as well as “health and equity.”
“We have, since 2014, had a holistic sustainability vision plan,” she said. “They are grounded in science and latest research informed by our faculty, students, and community.”
Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer Sherri A. Charleston also presented at the meeting on Harvard initiatives aimed at promoting equity. Though Charleston admitted the path would be a long one, she said she is confident in Harvard’s ability to improve.
“This is a long slog for us, we know that we're not going to solve a 400-year problem overnight,” she said. “We’re really trying to be thoughtful and committed to this.”
