After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Six new fellows—including several prominent journalists, an MIT professor, and a former adviser to Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaign—will join the Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy this semester to study the influence of the press on governments.
The four new Joan Shorenstein fellows, announced Monday, are Adam J. Berinsky, a political science professor at MIT; Helen Boaden, director of BBC Radio; Farai N. Chideya ’90, a journalist and author of six books; and Zack Exley, a political and technology consultant who worked as a senior advisor to the Sanders campaign. The Joan Shorenstein fellowship is an application-based award granted each semester to visiting scholars, journalists, and policymakers for research relating to media and policy.
The Shorenstein Center named Richard A. Stengel, the former managing editor of TIME magazine, the recipient of the Walter Shorenstein Media and Democracy Fellowship. While at the Kennedy School, Stengel will lead discussions on the press and government with students and faculty.
Meighan Stone, president of the girls’ education advocacy organization The Malala Fund will also be in residence as the Shorenstein Center’s second Entrepreneurship Fellow. Stone’s research at the Shorenstein Center will center on the intersection of media and refugee policy, she said.
The Shorenstein fellows will arrive at Harvard in the wake of one of the most turbulent presidential elections in recent history, and one that has provoked widespread scrutiny of the role of media and journalism in politics.
Many of the new fellows said that they plan to focus on the events of last year’s election and the shifting opinions of the electorate while at the Shorenstein Center.
Chideya, a former fellow at the Institute of Politics, plans to write about the role of race and gender in political press coverage.
“I’ve covered every election since 1996, including this past election, which I covered for FiveThirtyEight,” Chideya said. “I’ll be working with people at MIT Media Lab on how fake news spreads, and then looking at the race and gender of people who work in the media.”
Exley will research what he sees as an “artificial” divide between religious and secular Americans, and seek proposals to create a “new majority” from multiple camps.
“I'm going to be looking at the ways that the media and the party primary system have interacted to create the sense that there are only two, simplistic political cultures in America: the conservative Christian subculture and the secular progressive subculture,” Exley said.
Boaden, a British broadcaster, said she is interested in studying the challenges facing “public service” journalists after polarizing events like the U.S. election and the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
“I think the thing that particularly interests me at the moment is whether or not impartial journalism—by which I mean journalism that rigorously examines evidence that doesn’t take sides—can survive in this new age of anger and hyperbole and clearly social media,” Boaden said.
Exley, Boaden, and Stone all said they were excited to meet students, faculty, and other scholars as Shorenstein fellows.
“It’s a chance to be stimulated, it’s a chance to talk to peers, people who know things I don’t know,” Boaden said of the fellowship. “Above all, I love engaging with young people—I love their energy. I love that part of my job.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
James S. Ackerman, an esteemed Renaissance architectural historian and veteran of the Second World War, died Dec. 31 in Cambridge. He was 97.
Born in San Francisco and educated at Yale and New York University, Ackerman taught at Harvard from 1960 until his retirement in 1990. Colleagues in the History of Art and Architecture Department remember a “groundbreaking” and “legendary” scholar who mentored students throughout his time at Harvard.
“Jim Ackerman was notable for taking on key fundamental figures in architectural history as well as the key questions in architectural history,” said Joseph Koerner, a History of Art and Architecture professor. “He belonged to a generation of art historians who were moving away from formal descriptions of art and architecture into the social world”.
His primary area of expertise was Renaissance Italy, and his work in the field remains significant decades after his retirement. Ackerman once wrote he considered his scholarly approach  “structuralist and vaguely post-Marxist.”
“His books on Michelangelo, 1960, and Palladio, 1965, are both classics, still in print, still the best way for students of any age to get into these complex and fascinating subjects,” said  Joseph J. Connors, a History of Art and Architecture professor.
Ackerman, then a recent graduate, served in the U.S. Army in Italy during World War II. He wrote that seeing Renaissance-era buildings in Italy taught him that “actual works of art are much better than photographs as a stimulus to research.” Koerner described Ackerman’s academic coming-of-age as in “a time of great upheaval,” adding that Ackerman “didn’t have this professional, simple pathway.”
For History of Art and Architecture professor Alina A. Payne, Ackerman’s brilliance derived from his ability to combine the history of architecture with the history of art.
She said he had an “extraordinary way of identifying problems and presenting them in a lucid and clear way.”
Payne pointed to Ackerman’s ability to find “something unexpected and interesting out of a project that other scholars had not identified.” She cited his observations about the “structural logic” behind the columns in the Laurentian Library or the fact that the curvature of the Capitoline Hill Square echoed that of the globe as examples.
Ackerman’s interests spanned far beyond the Renaissance. David J. Roxburgh, chair of the History of Art and Architecture Department, noted that Ackerman maintained an interest in the relationship between art and science and contemporary architecture. Payne recalled Ackerman, then aged 94, climbing with his cane to the fifth floor of the Sackler Library for a seminar on modern architecture.
Koerner described him as “amazingly alive” even in old age.
Ackerman’s “pursuit of important professional responsibilities was of the character of someone twenty years younger,” Koerner said. He said Ackerman used to visit him on “this amazing tricycle contraption.”
Roxburgh, Payne and Koerner all said that Ackerman was a devoted mentor to young scholars.
“He had this great warmth for young people, he supported them, he encouraged them, he wrote letters for them, he worked with them,” Payne said.
Roxburgh called him “incredibly gracious with his time," remembering “impromptu conversations in Widener, on campus, in the swimming pool, in the Sackler, about the work that we were doing.”
Koerner said Ackerman worked tirelessly to open up the membership of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, especially to younger artists and women. He said Ackerman’s top piece of advice to aspiring art and architecture historians was to “find your voice” in both a figurative and literal sense: putting one’s voice into scholarship and getting public speaking lessons.
Ackerman’s final book, “Origins, Invention, Revision,” was published last year and included an account of his military service, as well as essays on everything from Frank Gehry to the classical architecture of India.
“He was a major force in the field right up to the end,” Connors said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The ball caromed off the back rim and out to the left side of the paint, with bodies diving onto the floor to grab it. Meanwhile, the ball had already rolled out to co-captain Destiny Nunley, who calmly stroked the baseline jumper to give her team a late win, 66-64, over La Salle at Tom Gola Arena.
“I am still a little numb right now,” Nunley said after the game. “I just know we needed a basket, and the ball happened to roll to me, and I picked it up and did what I knew how to do: shoot it.”
Thanks to Nunley’s heroics, which included a team-high 19 points, the Harvard women’s basketball team (13-1) extended its win streak to 13 games and 56 days as it avoided defeat at the hands of an athletic Explorers (9-7) squad. The Texas native sank 9-of-15 field goals and grabbed 12 boards to collect her second double-double of the season.
The evening’s festivities did not start as well as they ended for the visitors, with La Salle’s shooters giving the Crimson a frosty reception despite the warm temperatures in Philadelphia. Explorers guards Adreana Miller and Amy Griffin each scored seven in the first quarter as La Salle raced out to an 18-10 lead, tied for Harvard’s largest first-quarter deficit this year.
Freshman guard Nani Redford injected some much-needed energy into the Crimson’s play early in the second quarter, scoring four straight to cut the lead to three. Harvard continued to struggle with making open shots and even committed five traveling violations in the first half. With the outside shots not falling, the Crimson looked to get the ball inside but was met by the long arms of Explorers senior forward Lisa Mintzer, who collected three blocks on the night.
“We haven’t seen a shot-blocker like her all season, so that took some adjusting to,” Nunley said. “We’re definitely going to see that coming up. Penn has two twin towers, so this was good practice for us. We weren’t ready for that, and they were really athletic.”
Harvard’s offense exploded into life after the intermission, fueled by threes from sophomore guard Madeline Raster and freshman guard Katie Benzan. Nunley began to find her rhythm as well after a difficult first half, hitting all five of her field goals in the third quarter. In all, the Crimson scored 28 points in that frame, the most it has scored in any quarter this season.
“[The key is to] slow down and execute,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “When you have a team that is athletic as we are, the tendency is to try harder, go faster when in fact you should do the opposite. They did an excellent job, they switched a lot of screens. [Their coach’s] scout was great on us.”
With 45 seconds left in the third quarter, Boehm spun and banked in a layup, giving Harvard its first lead of the night. La Salle responded with a bucket of its own, tying the game at 50 heading into the fourth quarter.
Miller scored eight of her game-high 27 points in the fourth in response to buckets by sophomore guard Sydney Skinner and Raster. The teams remain deadlocked, Skinner’s layup knotting things up at 62 with just 1:40 left in the game.
Boehm made a key layup to give Harvard the lead with under a minute to play, but then sent Miller to the line on the ensuing possession with a chance to tie the game. Miller sunk both free throws with 36 seconds left.
On the ensuing Crimson possession, Nunley picked up the loose ball off a Raster miss and stroked the 15-foot jumper to give the visitors a two point lead with 1.9 seconds remaining. Griffin missed a wild three-pointer with time expiring, and Harvard’s unbeaten run continued with the remainder of Ivy League play remaining.
