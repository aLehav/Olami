After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Etruscan, Greek, Chinese, and Islamic vases find a place among the vast collection of the Harvard Art Museum alongside the work of European masters like Rembrandt, Van Gogh, and Picasso. Only a few blocks away, Pueblo ceramics from the American Southwest and pottery from the Moche civilization in Peru reside in the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. While the few blocks that separate the museums are rather small, the assumptions motivating the division between art objects and ethnographic objects are significant. Recently, though, steps have been taken both on and off campus to complicate the division between fine art and anthropology museums.
Originally the precursor to the modern museum, cabinets of curiosities or wonder rooms displayed a hodge-podge of objects that drew from domains as diverse as natural history, geology, archaeology, ethnography, and fine art. The British Museum, which opened in 1759 and was one of the first public museums, was construed from the very beginning as a “universal museum” with a collection that included art, applied art, archaeology, and anthropology.
As the museum evolved, however, divisions emerged between the fine art museum and the anthropology or archaeology museum. In the 19th century, the Golden Age of Museums, cultural objects were seen as belonging to two different categories: art objects, considered primarily for their aesthetic value and arranged chronologically to trace artistic developments, and artifacts, grouped by civilization and serving as generic representatives of a particular culture. Not surprisingly, the objects designated art tended to be Western, while those classified as artifacts tended to be from so-called “primitive” cultures such as Native American, sub-Saharan African, and Pacific Island. Following this current of thought, the Peabody was founded in 1866, displaying its collections as instruments for social scientific inquiry rather than aesthetic contemplation.
It is only in more recent years that those divisions have come under fire and begun to blur. In France, for example, the former Musée d’Éthnographie du Trocadéro founded in 1878 underwent various iterations before giving way in 2006 to the Musée du Quai Branly, whose controversial name alone indicates a refusal to identify itself as an anthropology or ethnography museum. The collections of the Quai Branly museum are beautifully displayed and treated as aesthetic objects rather than as historic artifacts that serve as lenses into the culture. Like a Greek krater or a Renaissance altarpiece, African textiles and Oceanic masks can be stripped of their initial context and function—their use value, in other words—and transplanted into the museum context where they acquires a new kind of value—aesthetic value.
Closer to home, the traditional dichotomy between art and artifacts is also slowly beginning to break down. In just a few months, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston (MFA) will unveil its new wing devoted to the Art of the Americas. The new wing, designed by Norman Foster, will contain over 50 new galleries spread over four floors. Visitors will begin on the ground floor with the Pre-Columbian era and work their way up until they get to the modernist masters like Jackson Pollock and Franz Kline on the top floor, alongside African-American artist Jacob Lawrence and Cuban artist Wilfredo Lam. Objects from South, Central, and North America will be presented as forming a coherent whole, a particular trajectory through the evolution of artistic practice.
This groundbreaking proposal to exhibit objects from the entire hemisphere, ranging from painting and photography to musical instruments and the decorative arts, points to the dissolving boundaries between the traditional categories of art and artifacts.
Here on campus, the traditional distinction between art and anthropology, embodied in the existence of the Harvard Art Museum, on the one hand, and the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology on the other, is also being obscured.
On the third floor of the Sackler galleries, Harvard Art Museum curator and History professor Ivan Gaskell has installed a Native American archer’s bow on loan from the Peabody Museum. Many courses taught by History of Art and Architecture faculty also incorporate objects from the Peabody’s collections and hold their sections in the Peabody galleries. This Thursday, April 1, the Harvard Art Museum Undergraduate Connection, which traditionally holds events at the Harvard Art Museum, will host a Night at the Peabody Museum, with student-led tours that treat the objects on display as artworks worthy of art historical inquiry.
Hopefully gestures like the MFA’s inclusion of Mesoamerican and Native American works in an art museum alongside the works of Gilbert Stuart and John Singleton Copley will help illustrate that these marginalized cultures do indeed merit appreciation and that the European masters are not the only artists entitled to aesthetic consideration. At the very least, it will present the viewer with the opportunity to experience the art of civilizations whose cultural output is traditionally relegated to the ethnography museum in order to permit an honest comparison.

CORRECTION: March 31, 2010
An earlier version of the Mar. 30 arts article "Artifacts Take Their Rightful Place as Art" incorrectly stated that the new wing in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston was designed by Renzo Piano. In fact, it was designed by Norman Foster.

April 2-10
Loeb Mainstage
Directed by James M. Leaf ’10
Produced by Elizabeth G. Shields ’10, Elizabeth J. Krane ’11, Nelson T. Greaves ’10, and Jan Luksic ’11
“We must call a halt to the revolution and begin the Republic!” says the French revolutionary Marie-Jean Hérault de Séchelles in Georg Büchner’s “Danton’s Death,” which will be performed on the Loeb Mainstage from April 2-10. This Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club (HRDC) production seeks to make accessible the concept of revolution, while still maintaining the play’s original message.
Director James M. Leaf ’10 says, “A modern American audience has no experience with a revolution; however, there have been revolutions in other countries, so we examined other countries. And those revolutions are at work in a lot of the play’s aesthetics.”
This inspiration is evidenced in the rich costumes of the play, which draw upon the uniforms of various revolutions across history. Despite a bare-bones approach in scenic design, lighting and stage effects will also play a dramatic role in bringing the feel of the revolution to the theater.
“Danton’s Death” follows the life of Georges Danton, a prominent figure in the Revolutionary Government after the French Revolution. In the play, Danton is charged with the creation of the Revolutionary Tribunal, which doles out justice in whatever way it sees fit—largely without trials, evidence, or witnesses.
Months after the Tribunal’s creation, however, Danton realizes its awful power which is responsible for the deaths of many innocent French citizens. He fights to end its reign of terror, a choice which eventually leads him to the guillotine.
Although the play is originally set in the terrifying world of the French Revolution, Leaf wishes to bring it out of its 19th-century French mold and create a more universally applicable rendition. “The play is not set in the past,” Elizabeth G. Shields ’10, one of the play’s executive producers, says.
Leaf agrees, “We’re trying to evoke the world of revolution and the idea of revolution as a whole, not summarize it as it relates to the French Revolution.” Shields adds, “The richness of the play is apparent, but we’re trying to make it less esoteric. We’re trying to bring out the fervor and passion of the Revolution.”

April 2-10
Loeb Experimental Theater
Directed by Brandon J. Ortiz ’12
Music directed by Mark R. Parker ’12
Produced by Katie R. McNicol ’12 and Marta Bralic ’12
“This show is real. It’s very, very real. At the same time it’s a fun rock musical with a lot of catchy tunes.”
This is how director Brandon J. Ortiz ’12 describes the new production of Stephen Schwartz’s “Working,” which explores the complexity of modern working lives through a series of songs and monologues. The play recounts the insights and hardships of actual people who hold many various jobs, such as waitresses, CEOs, hookers, teachers, truckers, and housewives.
According to Art R. Bartolozzi IV ’12, who plays a corporate executive, these issues concern all of us, because, whether we like it or not, work has become central to many people’s self-conception.
“The play is showing how jobs force you into an identity, which every character deals with differently. Some of them want to be labeled and some don’t,” Bartolozzi says.
To get a greater understanding of their roles, especially as they relate to the current situation of workers on campus, the actors have been talking to the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers. The union is also sponsoring the show and providing the costumes, which are borrowed from people who actually hold some of the jobs that the play portrays.
The idea of expressing working conditions through music immediately resonated with the Harvard Union. Martha Robb, who has been part of the union since 1983 and is helping the “Working” staff, recalls that when it was just forming, its organizers used to go out to the arcade of the Holyoke Center and sing about their ideas to present them in a lighter and funnier way.
Similarly in the play, there is a balance between songs and monologues. The monologues are more serious and present the facts of life, while the songs sound more optimistic as they reveal the character’ emotions.
“The characters speak the monologues about tough working conditions, and then the songs are a release,” Ortiz says. “What I hope comes out here is the sense of hope.  People retain hope against all odds.”

“In numbers, the mysteries of life can be revealed,” claims the cast of “Adding Machine,” the Off-Broadway musical making its New England premiere at SpeakEasy Stage Company, where it will run through April 10. Unfortunately, the musical fails to deliver any illuminating observations on either numbers or life’s mysteries. An adaptation of Elmer Rice’s 1923 expressionist play of the same title, “Adding Machine” tells the story of Mr. Zero, a downtrodden worker whose life suddenly collapses. What follows is a visually bizarre, musically unpleasant, and theatrically uninspiring slog through various 20th century intellectual trends, a trek made only slightly palatable by an innovative set and a glimmer of nuanced physical acting.
On the day of his 25th anniversary at his job, Mr. Zero (Brendan McNab) arrives at work expecting a promotion as a reward for all his years of dutiful service. Instead, his boss (who struggles to even remember Mr. Zero’s name) casually announces that he is fired, as a new adding machine will replace him. Furious, Mr. Zero kills his boss and is subsequently imprisoned and sentenced to death—a punishment that sends him to the Elysian Fields, an eerie afterlife where he reflects on his past existence.
From the show’s first moments, Mrs. Zero (Amelia Broome) brays at her husband, and it becomes immediately apparent that Mr. and Mrs. Zero are very unhappily married. “I was a fool when I picked you / You ain’t much to be proud of,” she wails ferociously in the opening scene.
Mr. Zero is equally malcontent—with his life (“I ain’t impressed”), with women (“Women make me sick!”), and even with total strangers (“Jews get two holidays to my one!”). Morally, he remains equally troubled, as he expresses doubt and contempt for organized religion, yet finds no other consistent ethical basis upon which to judge himself and others.
Frustratingly, however, this existential angst is as banal and simplistic as the characters’ blatantly symbolic names, and the play’s drama too often feels shallow. For instance, immediately after Mr. Zero reveals his crime to his wife, a solo musical number follows in which he oh-so-metaphorically wails his woes from a metal chain-link metal half-fence, thrashing about like a caged animal. In this nihilistic moment, his life comes undone. By grasping at threads of multiple modern philosophies, any coherent structure to the play is lost.
The root of this superficiality lies chiefly in the show’s actors, as their performances consistently fail to spark interest or emotional engagement. In scenes that are clearly aiming at tenderness—such as a rare moment of fond reminiscing shared by Mr. Zero and his wife the night before his execution—the actors dully recite trite exchanges which fail to evoke empathy, let alone hold attention.
The actors are actually most effective when they simply confine their performances to physical acting, such as when Broome savagely stamps around in sturdy, thick-strap Mary Jane shoes, as if ready to trample McNab at any moment. Always snappy and punctuated in her gestures, be it forcefully slapping down McNab’s newspaper or thrusting guests through the door as they arrive for a party, Broome moves with a brusque urgency that captures both the precision and frustration of her disappointing life.
“Disappointing” does not quite do justice to the atrocity that is the show’s music, composed by Joshua Schmidt. Despite going for the experience of a chamber musical—which feels more like a play with music than a traditional musical—some numbers are actively painful to suffer through (such as “Ham and Eggs” and “Freedom!”), and several others feel underdeveloped.
One of the show’s only engaging elements is its creatively macabre scenery, designed by Susan Zeeman Rogers. The main set piece, a luminous red backlit curtain with thick black vertical lines and a series of numbers scrawled graffiti-like across it, gives the feeling of being trapped in a prison cell of tortured mathematics. The stage floor is expansively checkered black and white, spreading like a maniacal chessboard, as if to imply that the men and women who traverse it are merely pawns at the hands of some greater power.
Beyond its basic set pieces, the work also benefits from compelling staging by director Paul Melone. The entire stage is horizontally cleaved by a deep, trench-like space, through which actors at times trudge like dogged soldiers in stiff ranks or drift like lonely, faceless strangers through their quotidian lives.
The show also frequently stages its actors in a kind of visual triptych, arranging characters and props in three distinct groups, be it three couples at a dinner party, three inmates in jail, or three melancholy adding men toiling at their monotonous work. The tripartite visual tableau frequently created by the staging suggests a fixed, sorrowful moment in time—a moment which invites scrutiny from a distance, like a painting on a wall.
Ultimately, “Adding Machine” lacks the elegant exposition of mathematical concepts found in recent works like David Auburn’s “Proof” and the 2001 film “A Beautiful Mind,” as well as sophisticated, lucid inquiry into the actual mysteries of life. Instead, the play gestures to too many twentieth century intellectual trends—rejection of religious morality, nihilism, and existentialism—and winds up flailing wildly, spinning like an ideological top.

The inhabitants of Berk do not lead particularly reflective lives. It’s hard to when one resides in a Viking village that is constantly being raided by hordes of dragons. Considering whether there are ways other than violence to approach this situation is not something that occurs to them. “How to Train Your Dragon,” based on the Cressida Cowell book of the same name, is the story of what happens when one boy comes up with an alternative solution to the town’s troubles. Thankfully, it’s also a movie in which the characters and script compensate for a formulaic plotline.
The hero of the film is the unfortunately named Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel), who is the son of the stoic village chieftain, but inheritor of none of his physical prowess or impressive musculature. A thoughtful, contemplative sort, Hiccup does not quite fit in at dragon-slaying boot camp, where the motto is “Why read words when you can just kill the stuff the words tell you about?” This attitude is problematic for Hiccup, who has secretly befriended a dragon he has christened Toothless—a creature whose creepy cuteness is strikingly similar to that of Stitch from “Lilo and Stitch” (a film that happens to be written by Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, the co-writers and directors of “How to Train Your Dragon”).
Toothless is but one of many creatively crafted dragons in the film. Unlike the CGI-based cinematography, which often calls to mind the epic sweep of Peter Jackson with glorious pans across its digitized landscapes, the film’s dragons are awkward and strange. With outsized heads and teeth that jut out at uncomfortable angles, these are not the majestic and mysterious beasts of so many other films-—they are odd and misshapen, just like people. The movie’s message of empathy is thus underscored by its imagery.
But despite its feel-good message of cross-species acceptance, the movie is far from lacking in some good old-fashioned dragon mashing. Of course, it’s the sort of PG mayhem in which everything on the screen is spectacularly immolated except, conveniently, the people. Apparently, the dragons of “How To Train Your Dragon” are really bad with moving targets—perhaps that’s where the training comes in. But suffice to say, Hiccup’s efforts at human-dragon reconciliation do not go over as smoothly as he hoped.
For all the CGI bombast, though, what carries “How to Train Your Dragon” is the dialogue written for its characters and handed off to a superb cast. Baruchel plays the self-deprecating misfit Hiccup as though he’s talking to the audience, and not the characters on the screen. In this way, he pulls the viewer into his confidence, and both find themselves the only sane people in a village of blood-crazed Vikings.
The secondary cast, including Gerard Butler (as Hiccup’s dad, Stoick) and America Ferrera (as tomgirl Astrid, whom Hiccup wins over), acquit themselves admirably. Perhaps the most inspired supporting performance comes from the ever-dependable Craig Ferguson, who voices Hiccup’s mentor Gobber, a character who says everything mentor characters are never supposed to say in movies, thus providing some of the film’s best laughs. At one point, when Hiccup complains how he can’t help that he wasn’t born with the beefy physique of his father, Gobber helpfully explains “It’s not what’s outside that he dislikes—it’s what’s inside he can’t stand.”
All this character work pays off. The movie never feels like watching someone else play a video game. Instead, “How to Train Your Dragon” takes a classic and clichéd Hollywood storyline and makes it memorable. This is most evident in the wondrous scenes in which Toothless, Hiccup, and Astrid soar through the sunset to the beautiful Celtic-inspired score of John Powell. Viewers may recall a very similar CGI experience in “Avatar,” in which flying beasts streak the sky in symbiotic unity with their mounted protagonists. The difference in “How to Train Your Dragon” is that the audience actually cares about the characters and not just the images. What it lacks in beauty, it makes up for in humanity.

It is not difficult to figure out the story of “Hot Tub Time Machine.” There is a hot tub. It allows people to travel through time. In spite or perhaps because of this simplicity—from the film’s opening, cornball photo montage of people in hot tubs, all the way to its end credits—“Hot Tub Time Machine” is a raucously funny movie, even if parts of it feel out of place.
The time travelers of the film are four pathetic individuals, discontent with their boring and mediocre lives. There’s Adam (John Cusack), a sadsack insurance salesman who has just been left by his girlfriend; Jacob (Clark Duke), Adam’s nephew and asocial, geeky “Stargate” fanfiction author; Nick (Craig Robinson), a former musician who now dissects dog poop for a living; and Lou (Rob Corrdry), an alcoholic who Adam describes as “an asshole, but he’s our asshole.”
The film centers on a nostalgic trip to a ski resort, where the group hopes to relive the bacchanalian days of their youth. “We were young, we had momentum,” laments Cusack’s character. Surprised to find the entire town rundown and decrepit, they console themselves with alcohol, drugs, and a mysterious hot tub. In the morning, they wake up in 1986, which the film recreates in painstaking detail. There are a number of funny references to Poison, “Miami Vice,” Jheri curls, Ronald Reagan, and when MTV actually lived up to its namesake.
The group sets out as their younger selves, reliving their past. Fearing the butterfly effect, though, they attempt to recreate events exactly as they had happened before. Throughout the entire film, the actors are shown in their mature, present-day bodies, despite everyone else in 1986 seeing them as adolescents. Director Steve Pink occasionally cuts between the actors and their younger reflections in mirrors in a sight gag used to great effect, for instance, reminding us of Nick’s ill-advised Kid ‘n Play haircut. Jacob, however, having not been born in 1986, remains in his normal body.
The actor who undoubtedly steals the show is Corrdry, who, unashamedly and sometimes with glee, is not afraid to go for the easy laugh. This is evident in a scene in which he pulls out his own catheter, or his numerous instances of projectile vomiting, getting beat up, and rear nudity. It is mostly immature, but Corrdry pulls it off with a lot of energy and enthusiasm.
Craig Robinson’s Nick, married in the present day, is also a very funny character, especially during a cocaine-fueled recap of the “Terminator” series or in a lewd phone call to his then nine-year-old wife. He also manages to pull off a surprisingly listenable cover (or is it a debut performance?) of The Black-Eyed Peas’ “Let’s Get It Started”.
Cusack and Duke’s characters, however, are less compelling. Adam gets bogged down in an uninspiring relationship with a music journalist (Lizzy Caplan), musing on predestination at odd, seemingly random points in the story. It’s as if Pink tried to dispense with the heavy, emotional baggage of the film as quickly as possible, which eventually bogs down the film’s pacing. Jacob, having not been alive in 1986, spends the majority of the film running around frantically, trying to figure out how to get back to the present.
The supporting cast is rounded out by Chevy Chase, only referred to as “the mysterious time travel guy,” who does almost nothing in the film except speak cryptically and repeatedly mistake Jacob for a girl. 
There are a few great jokes in the film that involve Crispin Glover as a hotel attendant whose present-day self is missing an arm. Throughout the film, there are numerous instances of the character coming close to losing the limb, much to the frustration of Corrdry, who desperately wants to see it happen.
As crude as it is, the film manages to be a success, mostly riding on the enthusiasm and comic timing of its main cast. It might not be highbrow, but “Hot Tub Time Machine” is still worth taking a dip.

From harrowing early documentaries providing the first looks into the Nazi death camps to award-winning blockbusters like “Schindler’s List,” cinema has proven itself uniquely suited to conveying the grim significance of the Holocaust. The volume of cinematic depictions can only be explained by the event’s call for intensely visual artistic response.
Last Tuesday the Harvard Film Archive explored the history of those responses, using one of the earliest cinematic portrayals of the Holocaust as a starting point for a broader discussion.
The selected film was André de Toth’s “None Shall Escape” (1944), one of a small number of World War II-era Hollywood films that represented the extermination of European Jews then underway. The screening was preceded and followed by discussions with Jean-Michel Frodon, former managing editor of the seminal French film magazine, Cahiers du cinéma.
Frodon discussed “None Shall Escape” in the context of his new book “Cinema & the Shoah,” an exploration of cinematic responses to the Holocaust. A complicated relationship between Hollywood and the Nazi Party, he explained, kept American cinema—despite its many Jewish industry leaders—from representing the Nazis negatively until nearly the end of the war.
As an example of that tension, Frodon cited the assassination of a Jewish Warner Bros. representative in Berlin by the Nazis as early as 1934. “Of course,” he added, “Hollywood also had to consider commercial concerns,” given that many Americans had conflicted views of the war. “None Shall Escape,” for example, did well at the box office but was far from a breakaway hit.
However, the film clearly had aspirations beyond the financial. Released just as the war was ending, it also functioned as a piece of propaganda: “None Shall Escape” opens and closes with the presiding judge of a war crimes trial directly addressing the audience, asking that justice be done in light of the trial.
The film’s narrative runs through the testimony of the trial’s witnesses, who tell the story of corrupted German Willhelm Grimm. Grimm’s progression from wounded World War I veteran to odious SS leader must have given its  viewers a more nuanced, but ultimately condemning image of the typical Nazi.
In the question and answer session following the screening, viewers expressed surprise at seeing the Holocaust represented cinematically before the end of the war. Frodon explained that de Toth was sent by a news agency to film the situation in Poland in 1939, giving him some insight into the effects of Nazi rule, which is especially critical given the film’s Polish setting.
Another viewer raised the issue of historical accuracy, questioning the film’s use of a priest as a protagonist and its depiction of a rabbi urging Jews to take up arms against the Nazis. Frodon reminded the audience of the film’s political aspirations: designed to unite a fractured America behind a call to justice, “None Shall Escape” had an understandable interest in providing Americans with immediately identifiable protagonists.
All cinematic depictions of the Holocaust, Frodon urged, must be understood in their context—when they were made, by whom, and for what purpose. Historical inaccuracies should be noted, but artistic responses, even commercial Hollywood films, cannot be judged solely by their historical veracity.
Nevertheless, Frodon didn’t ignore the tough questions. In fact, he raised one himself, putting simply the question of American awareness of the Holocaust while it was taking place: “Who knew what?”
To this, he answered, there is no easy response. He described one often-lamented instance of an American spy plane taking photographs of Auschwitz early in the war. Those photos, taken in hopes of locating factories rather than atrocities, went unnoticed. The line between knowledge and ignorance, then, was remarkably thin.
What is clear is that the eventual realization of this atrocity brought with it an immediate cinematic response, an artistic outpouring that continues to this day. The relationship between film and the Holocaust, Frodon believes, is one that continues to evolve and deserves further investigation.
His book was written, he says, “not to say how films about the Holocaust should or should not be made,” but rather to explore the connection between profoundly affecting art and its profoundly affecting historical origin.Whether through the viewing of films like “None Shall Escape” or the reading of books like “Cinema and the Shoah,” that connection continues to demonstrate its lasting relevance.

The Tunisian-born French film director Abdellatif Kechiche received the 2010 Genevieve McMillan Award at the Harvard Film Archive last Friday. “I am moved and touched [and] all the more gratified to receive this prize at this particular time because I am in the final stages of my most recent film, which can be tiring, and [this] is a great motivator to go back into the editing room,” Kechiche said.
The Genevieve McMillan Award was first established in 1997 to support distinguished filmmakers of Francophone-African origin. Although he has spent most of his life in France, Kechiche, the eleventh recipient of the prize, was deemed to have excellently portrayed France’s Arab community through his films. To mark the occasion, the Harvard Film Archive presented a weekend-long retrospective of his three films, starting with 2004’s “Games of Love and Chance.”
At the time of its release, “Games of Love and Chance” was a triumphant critical success, winning four prizes—including Best Film, Best Director, Best Writing, and Most Promising Actress—at the César Awards in France. His subsequent movie, “The Secret of the Grain,” released in 2007, achieved even stronger critical acclaim. Along with the same four César prizes rewarded to “Games of Love and Chances,” it also received three others at the Venice Film Festival, including the Special Jury Prize.
Kechiche introduced “Games of Love and Chance” with a heartfelt tribute to its cast, which is almost solely comprised of teenagers. He said, “Now we are going to see an older film, the one that I made several years ago, made with limited means, very little money, but the one in which the energy of young people became its true motivating factor, my joy, and drove the production.” 
“Games of Love and Chance” is about the teenage Abdelkrim, or Krimo, from the Paris suburbs who becomes infatuated with his gamine classmate Lydia. Krimo joins the school production of Marivaux’s “Games of Love and Chance” to play the counterpart of Lydia’s character. However, Krimo fails to go beyond merely murmuring the lines, since, as a matter of fact, he has never read a single book in his life not to mention 18th-century classical theatre. Kechiche’s camera observes the unfolding of the story with a heavy hue of endearment.
During the question and answer session that followed the screening, Kechiche seemed to continuously avoid an analytical approach to the film. “I did not explicitly set out to give the film a sociological label,” he said. “I primarily wanted to tell a story around the themes that were important to me—theatre, first love, the energy of youth.” Kechiche added that the specific social milieu was due to autobiographical reasons, and that any sociological or political nuances the film might deliver have been subconscious from his part. 
Kechiche was more enthusiastic when discussing the purely aesthetic components of the film. For example, he gave a poetic explanation to his frequent use of close-ups, saying,
“In making the film, I found myself actually unable to move the camera backwards and open the frame. With each film I promised myself I will move it back, I will broaden the shot, but it has only gotten closer with each film.” 
“It seems that there is something mysterious in the faces themselves. Something seems to appear in the faces—which I still do not understand—I dare to even call it Truth, and I find it better expressed in close-ups.”

“I am turned woman of business,” remarked Louisa Catherine Adams in January 1815, having received a letter from her husband, John Quincy Adams, inviting her to make the journey from Saint Petersburg to Paris. Her husband had not specified a time limit, but Mrs. Adams began making arrangements for her immediate departure, accompanied by her seven-year old son. She was thrilled to be leaving Russia after having suffered the wearying expense of expatriate living, the oppressive politesse required by her regular engagements at the Tsar’s imperial court, and six years of seemingly endless winters. But she faced a two-thousand mile journey in freezing conditions across a continent traumatized by more than a decade of war between Napoleon and the European allies, to meet a husband with whom her relationship had always been fraught—especially since the death of their infant daughter three years before.
In “Mrs. Adams in Winter: a Journey in the Last Days of Napoleon,” against the background of Adams’ troubled marriage and peripatetic life as a diplomatic wife, British historian Michael O’Brien marshals an impressive array of sources in order to recreate Mrs. Adams’ journey across Europe. The result is an agreeable mix of biography, travelogue, and historical narrative—a book whose form is as hybrid as its subject. O’Brien describes Louisa Catherine Adams as “migrant, transnational, bicultural, bilingual,” and proposes to read her journey as an expression of those qualities, as well as in explicitly gendered terms as an example of “a woman acting in the name of other women.”
While “Mrs. Adams in Winter” does not fully deliver on its promise of this nuanced portrait, it succeeds admirably in reconstructing the quotidian details—cultural, financial, geographical—of overland travel in the early-19th century. We learn of the staple food of travelers in Prussia, “beer soup,” a mixture of beer, egg yolks, wheat and sugar; of a road-tax imposed on greased wheels; and of nights spent in post-stations, a kind of 19th-century motel where one slept in a cubicle with waist-height boards for walls. Through Mrs. Adams’ eyes, we see evidence of the Napoleonic conflict. In Eastern Prussia, she is alarmed by the thinned population, by clusters of unprotected women on the streets, and half-burned houses. Later, she passes the harrowed battlefield of Leipzig—scene of the biggest battle in Europe before World War I—where human skeletons are still strewn on the charred ground among scraps of leather and smashed muskets. And into this chronological narrative of life on the road, O’Brien skillfully weaves a series of telling anecdotes from Louisa Catherine Adams’s experience as a wife, mother, and American expatriate in Europe.
O’Brien sensitively profiles the relationship between Mrs. Adams and her husband, who became the sixth president of the United States a decade after Louisa made her journey through Europe. For most of his career, John Quincy Adams was deeply involved in his recreational study of the classics, of “Tacitus and Cicero, Massillon and Madame de Stael, the Bible and Milton”—often to the detriment of his relationship with his wife. Ever since their courtship and marriage in 1797, his bookishness and introversion had sat uncomfortably with his wife’s disposition, which was vulnerably romantic, although tempered by a worldliness granted by her upbringing in the “swirling world” of London. After meeting Quincy Adams in England, she had offended him by laughing at his earnestness, “as fashionable young women in London did at awkward young men from Massachusetts.” Later, they would fall out over Louisa’s desire to wear rouge in order to attenuate the “cadaverous” pallor of her complexion, which offended her husband’s puritan sensibilities. He insisted on wiping her face himself. She reflected in her memoir later, “All my beauty was clean washed away.”
The most moving and instructive anecdote appears at the end of the book, when O’Brien describes the death of the Adams’ only daughter, also named Louisa, in 1812. The baby’s protracted and painful death from dysentery and fever, over a period of four months, engendered a profound and lasting depression in her mother, who began to pine for death herself: “I feel that all my wishes center in the grave,” she wrote in her diary. To this haunting episode, O’Brien attributes Louisa’s determination to complete her epic journey alone, three years later. But it also allows the author to complicate his impression of John Quincy Adams, who for once grew distracted from politics, and grieved deeply for his daughter. O’Brien quotes from a letter written to his mother, Abigail Adams, in which he describes the child’s sufferings as so severe that “the sight of them would have wrung with compassion a heart of marble.”
In his acknowledgments, O’Brien refers to “Mrs. Adams in Winter” as a “literary experiment.” This description matches the book’s digressive structure, which shifts constantly from past to present and back again. Because of this, the narrative feels saturated in memory—although O’Brien’s restrained prose prevents the emergence of the lyricism or deep meditation from which his account could benefit. Nevertheless, “Mrs. Adams in Winter” is an informative and diverting—if not engrossing—read. Towards the end of the journey, O’Brien describes the provenance of his most valuable source, Louisa Catherine Adams’ own memoir of the journey, which she wrote down twenty years later, in 1836. Having encountered numerous obstacles to remembering, she was the first to concede its unreliability: “those who may read this memento mori, must endeavor to extract light from the chaos which lies before them; and I wish them joy of the trouble.” In “Mrs. Adams in Winter,” Michael O’Brien takes up her challenge, and succeeds commendably in bringing to light her story—a story that might otherwise have remained in the shadow of the family into which she never truly fit.

Even before the show officially begins, it becomes clear that Sonia C. Coman ’11’s “Leah” intends to break the mold. Cast members lie under blankets on stage, surrounded by large panes of translucent plastic. Meanwhile, “Theater Manager” Andrew N. Shindi ’13 introduces the play as “Sewing in Springtime,” a production which begins with the cast engaging in synchronized, choreographed sewing.
Compared to what is to come, however, this opening sequence is practicallynormal. Moments into the performance Margaret C. Kerr ’13, playing Leah, interrupts the play-within-a-play with an abrupt “Stop! Do my play!” before handing the manager a script—successfully hijacking the evening.
Thus begins the main event, a one-act play by the character Leah that offers an absurdist, fractured reinterpretation of her own past, present, and future. “The show will reinforce theater as a locus where reality and dream meet. In that realm, absurd talk is the wisest decision,” claims the synopsis. The play, which ran from March 25 to 27 in the Loeb Experimental Theater, takes that mission statement to heart.
Though that “absurd talk” may obscure any deeper meaning, the experience alone is bizarrely engaging. Characters merge and switch roles, slip without warning into gaudily staged dance routines, and ramble about six-foot moles and eating paper as the story follows Leah from traumatic childhood music lessons to the death of her husband, making all sorts of incomprehensible pit stops along the way.
Absurd it most definitely is, and attempting to figure out exactly what it’s supposed to mean is liable to result in a throbbing headache and not much more. But the play succeeds by not taking itself too seriously—the play-within-a-play format allows the cast to repeatedly break the fourth wall, and they offer a touch of self-conscious humor that avoids any potential frustration with the production’s opaqueness. Maupassant (Philip Y. Gingerich ’13), installed among the audience members, occasionally cheers on, shouts at, and has conversations with those onstage, while the theater manager, as Leah sobs over the body of her dead husband, exclaims exasperatedly, “Shut up! Who cares?”
From the monstrous papier maché mole that is suspended over the stage for the duration of the performance to a flaming-red lobster, remote controlled, the production’s staging provides an extra layer of madness to complement the actors’ efforts. While the props fit this manic mood, the sound accompaniment—mostly composed of indie rock acts like The Antlers—often feels overwrought. Tunes like The Antlers’ “Bear,” whose lyrics chronicle the effects of an abortion on a couple’s relationship, make for an incongruous backdrop to the more animated plot.
The actors themselves, after a somewhat hesitant start which reflects the utter self-confidence required to say lines like “I heard my own name too late… I never got accustomed to it,” by-and-large settle into their roles. Ilker Oztop GSAS ’12 , in particular, stands out playing both Leah’s husband and her son. The hip-gyrating, dance routine that introduces the son exemplifies his performance, elevating the script’s ludicrous dialogue to even more absurd heights with a frenzied, hyperkinetic energy. Kerr, too, handles her challengingly multifaceted role with panache, navigating dramatic peaks without overplaying them.
The façade does occasionally crack. Especially during the play’s less frantic segments, the actors seem to lose the thread of carefully-constructed madness, and become far less convincing as a result. The slightest note of hesitation in such a surrealistic production is enough to shatter the necessary suspension of disbelief. But since so much of “Leah” is spent in a high-energy, melodramatic atmosphere, these slips are more infrequent blemishes than a serious problem.
By the time the production loses control completely, as the actors toss away the script and start exhorting audience members to get out of their seats and “change!” it’s difficult not to be won over by the production’s whimsical chaos. It is unclear whether, when the layers are peeled away, “Leah” maintains coherence. While it provides plenty to think about, and the ending sheds some light on the play’s central meaning, there are still multiple interpretations to choose from—and it’s not evident that any individual one will fully explain the play’s complexities. The great benefit of absurdism, though, is that comprehension—or even coherence—doesn’t really seem to matter.

Every poetic career follows a different trajectory. Yeats’ style evolved and improved throughout his long career; Wordsworth composed his greatest works in his youth, but continued writing through his old age. The deterioration of poetic talent must be one of the greatest fears of an aging poet. Although Derek Walcott—who turned eighty this past January—is a Nobel Laureate and the author of over twenty published volumes of poetry, the dread of losing his poetic ability permeates “White Egrets,” his newest collection. He writes, “If it is true that my gift has withered, that there’s little left of it, / if this man is right, then there’s nothing left to do / but abandon poetry like a woman because you love it / and would not see her hurt, least of all by me.”
But despite his evident misgivings, Walcott is in no danger of harming the craft of poetry. Far from it, he writes in characteristically powerful verse, maintaining a pulsing rhythm and forceful voice throughout his collection. “White Egrets” is composed of a sequence of poems that range in subject from Walcott’s travels in Italy and Spain to his former love affairs. As he explores a wide array of memories and places, the poet attempts to come to terms with his recollections of the past and the effects of age upon his body and mind.
“White Egrets” is aptly named; images of the splendid birds are scattered throughout the collection. In one instance, the birds become symbols of immortality as Walcott contemplates the inevitable mortality of himself and his friends. The birds, part of a natural cycle, return annually, seemingly unchanged, while the personalities around him disappear year by year: “Some friends, the few I have left / are dying, but the egrets stalk through the rain / as if nothing mortal can affect them, or they lift / like abrupt angels, sail, then settle again.” Elsewhere, he himself identifies with the birds, comparing his own white hair to the birds’ white feathers.
Even when Walcott is not explicitly contemplating the process of aging, whiteness saturates his vision; he notices the white shore, white ferries, white wine, the “white scream” of birds, and even the whiteness of the page as his poem comes to a close. In his constant encounters with objects washed in white, Walcott is trying to create a kind of visual rhyme. In his poem “In Italy,” in which he speaks of his experience in Italy as an elderly man, he writes, “my hair rhymes with those far crests and the bells / of the hilltop towers number my errors.” Walcott’s repetitious images of whiteness create a lyrical continuity among his poems. Each one can easily stand on its own, but together they form a natural sequence of memories and contemplations.
At times, Walcott’s obsession with the effects of age runs the risk of becoming too personal, or even self-indulgent. Details of his physical ailments and his fear of waning virility can detract from his deeper meditations on his hopes, his regrets, and his poetry. At one point, he describes “a furious itch that raises welts” over his body; elsewhere he writes, “My lust is in great health, but, if it happens / that all my towers shrivel to dribbling sand, / joy will still bend the cane-reeds with my pens / elation....” Yet although the poet’s fixation on physiognomy is somewhat off-putting, it also serves as a reminder of his basic humanity. The speaker in these poems is not only a craftsman rendering his visions of life into astonishing verse—he is also an elderly man like any other, faced with the concerns that accompany the process of getting older.
It is when Walcott turns his attention to his own poetry, however, that he displays the heights of his lyrical abilities. As he gazes once more at egrets taking flight in the distance, he compares them to the poems that he is sending forth into the world: “they are the bleached regrets / of an old man’s memoirs, printed stanzas / showing their hinged wings like wide open secrets.” The “bleached” quality of his thoughts is not due to his age alone; the poet is presenting himself to the world—starkly and without dissemblance.
Though Walcott displays his most naked doubts and feelings, his collection never becomes too self-serious. His sense of humor helps to create a variety of tone throughout his work. Walcott reveals a keen wit, peppering his verse with quips such as, “Well, if we burnt, it was at least New York.”
But he always returns to those figures of purity and openness, the white birds who are symbols of both age and immortality. With a long career already behind him, Walcott’s concern lies not only with the precariousness of his physical life, but also with the lifespan of the poetry that he has spent a lifetime crafting. This collection, however, indicates that there is no cause for the poet’s anxiety. Walcott has managed to shape a sequence of poems as blindingly majestic as the birds for which they are named.

Working her way through the legacies of conceptual and appropriation art, Andrea Fraser, an artist and UCLA art professor, uses performance and video to engage in institutional critique—the investigation and questioning of the structures and dynamics of the art world. The Carpenter Center currently exhibits “Andrea Fraser: Boxed Set,” which will run until April 4. After participating in a discussion with  Marjorie Garber, a professor of English and Visual and Environmental Studies, and Helen Molesworth, the chief curator of the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, as a part of the “Church of What’s Happening Now: New Art, New Artists” lecture series, the artist sat down with the Crimson to answer some questions about the development of her career.
The Harvard Crimson: You were only 23 for Museum Highlights and even younger for your work with The V-Girls. How did you move from high school to the art world?
Andrea Fraser: I started doing museum tours in 1986 when I was twenty. It was at an exhibition at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York in the summer of 1986. I only did two years of high school. I moved to New York in November in 1981. I applied to the School of Visual Arts. They accepted me and I started in January.
So I went to art school and met a brilliant young art critic, Craig Owens—one of the chief formulators of post-modernism in the arts... I heard about the Whitney Museum’s independent study program... and he encouraged me to apply. So I dropped out of art school and started at the Whitney program at 18. I did that for one and a half years. Toward the end of my stay there, I published my first article, which was about Louise Lawler. The following summer, I did my first museum tour.
THC: The sociopolitical and economic conventions of art institutions can be examined and challenged in more literal forms like essays. Why did you choose to do so from an artistic approach? Do you believe one method is more effective and if so, why?
AF: Before I did my first museum tour performance, I had already started writing arts criticism. In a way, I remember thinking about [these] performances as arts criticism in action. There is a long history of artists engaging language [but] it was getting to the point where you went to a gallery and just stood there reading. I just thought, “There has to be a better way to bring in language and speech in order to engage in this discourse.”
I think an essay, which sort of sits on a page, can function in many of the same ways as a performance. I want [the essay] to not just sit on a page, but do something and perform.
THC: You often work by appropriating, rewriting, and taking on a role in your performance pieces. But, more recently, you’ve been creating works that present yourself not in an invented role. Why?
AF: Well, I think from a number of perspectives, it’s not as easy to distinguish what is me and not me. We have our names and specific biographies, but even our names are amalgams of other names like our parents’. And from a psychological and psychoanalytical perspective, we can think of people as being collections of other people and their relationships. Or collections of relationships that we have internalized and even things that we have invested our attention in and taken into ourselves. In a way doing the kind of work I did, it’s sort of about appropriation—I was making the process explicit and performing it.
THC: You discussed how you have moved from the view of being against art institutions to their defense in your career. How has your definition of institutional critique changed?
AF: I hate to say this, but there’s a lot of anti-institutionalism in the art world and elsewhere; however, at this point, I have to think about it as being a little adolescent. Of course, we want to be free on some level from institutional constraints and not only institutional but social determination. Art is a space of freedom where you can invent yourself and the world. [But] artists can’t invent meaning themselves. What works come to mean and how they exist in the marketplace and history is external to our control. That for me was the radical recognition now associated with institutional critique. If one thinks of this in this manner, it can go two ways. One was even more of a reaction: once we know how determining institutions are, let’s escape them. There was some of that impulse in me and my early work.
On the other hand, anyone really looking at institutional critique and the practice associated with it could see that it was never about escaping institutions. Like Marcel Duchamp’s “Urinal”—an object only takes on a specific meaning as an art object within a discourse with the history of art and within these institutions. Instead [of trying to escape] one is left to struggle within this discourse.
THC: Artistic intention and viewers’ interpretation don’t always agree. Do you believe your intention for the work trumps their interpretation?
AF: It’s been my official ideology for a long time that there are no wrong interpretations. As artists, we put a lot in store in our own intentions. We intend our works to mean some things, and that’s what we want the viewer to get and understand. What an artwork means broadly in society as a particular kind of cultural object is first of all overwhelmingly defined by the fact that the artwork exists and is recognized as being a work of art.
And very often, I don’t think artists always consider the field of meaning outside of intention. With my own work, my position is that you are responsible for all of it. Even if you did not intend it and even if it seems like pure projection on the viewer’s part, you are making this thing and putting it in the world.

The cumulative impact of over 100 years of critical acclaim makes the literary reputation of an acknowledged masterpiece such as Mark Twain’s “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn” seem impregnable. Twain’s classic book elevates the form of the picaresque novel into a story of individual freedom as Huck Finn and the escaped slave Jim row down the Mississippi River liberated from the constraints and judgments of society. “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn” is undoubtedly a classic of American literature, but too often literary scholarship tries to defend every aspect of a masterpiece as a successful aesthetic decision of the author. Sometimes reading a novel afresh, years after its publication, reveals flaws that the literary world has learned to overlook.
Twain’s classic offers a medley of colorful characters, memorably presented by his irreverent narrator. Although Huck presents each new figure with a keen eye for the ridiculous, Huck himself is a shifting comedic persona rather than a genuine, grounded character. His personality and world view changes to fit each scene, allowing him to effectively satirize any given situation. Although Huck often seems implausibly ignorant of the world’s conventions, he at times possesses astounding insight into how society operates. The temptation of the comedian is to conveniently modify his characters for a few extra laughs. While it is certainly unfair to judge the protagonist of a picaresque novel by the standards of realism, Huck’s inconsistency undercuts some of the comedic power of the book.
In the opening chapters Huck’s ignorance humorously undermines accepted social conventions. When a religious widow, after attempting to convince Huck of the benefits of Christianity, asserts that Tom Sawyer won’t be going to Heaven, Huck quips that he is glad he won’t go to Heaven “because I wanted [Tom Sawyer] and me to be together.” Twain extends Huck’s naiveté even further when Huck fails to understand that Tom’s fantasy games are not real. In one scene Huck believes that a traveling troupe of invisible Arabs with two hundred elephants was conjured by a genie. It is only after the incident that Huck reconsiders his gullibility. He “thought all this over for two or three days” and rubs an old lamp hoping to find a genie before eventually concluding “all that stuff was only just one of Tom sawyer’s lies... It had all the marks of Sunday School.”
Although it takes Huck three days to establish that Tom’s fantasies aren’t true, later in the novel Huck can immediately figure out how to convincingly lie to other characters. In one instance, Huck fabricates an entire story to convince a ferryman to lead a rescue party to save several people trapped in a sinking riverboat. Yet later, Huck is not able to figure out that the criminals called The Duke and The King are not real royalty. Huck’s capacity to understand and speak the truth seems to change in every scene.
The naïve narrator is a recurring trope in comic novels, which allows the author to objectively examine the hypocrisies and inconsistencies of society through the eyes of a figure who is not burdened by social preconceptions. But Twain conveniently adapts a narrator with a flexible naiveté, who can alternatively be ignorant of society’s sins and also knowingly participate in them. The consistently shifting innocence of Huck’s personality heightens the comedy throughout the novel, but also sacrifices the some of its substance.
Twain’s problematic use of comedic flexibility culminates in the novel’s controversial final scene. At the end of the novel, Jim is recaptured after a failed escape attempt and appears to be on the brink of being sold back into slavery. Miraculously, Jim is saved when Tom reveals that the whole escape plan was an elaborate game—Jim was already freed by his mistress on her deathbed. Some critics have criticized this ending as an evasion that allows Twain to avoid dealing with the evils of slavery, while others have defended the scene as a burlesque satire that serves as an appropriate conclusion for a picaresque novel. But disregarding this critical debate, the ending serves as the ultimate example of Twain’s tendency to sacrifice substance for satire. The deeper issues of the novel are thrown aside to make way for a happy and entertaining ending.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s said that Harvard freshman should know what they want before they even step foot in the yard. “Grades, sleep, friends—pick two,” runs the standard maxim. Wanting everything would be asking too much.
Whether one can have it all, or should even desire it, are driving questions of “The Heidi Chronicles,” Wendy Wasserstein’s 1988 Pulitzer Prize-winning play about an art historian searching for fulfillment among the women’s rights movement. Wasserstein’s Heidi came of age in the sixties and entered adulthood in the seventies, a time when women were supposed to achieve independence and gain new freedoms. She has brains, looks, and a successful career. So why is she so unhappy?
Last weekend’s production of “Chronicles,” directed by Charlotte H. Alter ’12 in the Adams Pool Theater, made these questions relevant and resonant. Led by a skilled cast and subtle directing, Heidi’s wanders and wonders were immediate and moving.
The plot is straightforward. Looking back from 1989, where Heidi (MacKenzie Sigalos ’10) is a professor specializing in women’s art, the play moves from her high school days and follows her increasing frustration with both her life and her peers. As Heidi struggles to reconcile her disappointment with the outcome of her choices and with the women’s movement, she remains firm in her belief that “all people deserve to fulfill their own potential.”
Such a biographical story places much weight on one character, but Sigolos carried a strong Heidi through the duration of the play. Her role is a demanding one—she was in every scene and at times performed almost entirely on her own—yet her delivery was seamless.
Nuances add flavor to the play’s simple timeline, and the supporting cast fully exploited these. On the one hand, “Chronicles” deals with grave themes: at its heart is the potential failure of feminism. But it is also a social satire, and a very funny one.
Around Heidi flit a host of eccentric characters who add color and humor to the play. As Susan Johnston, Heidi’s volatile best friend, Emily B. Hyman ’13 was both boisterous and comical. She portrayed extreme change with grace. At the play’s beginning, she is a loud member of a woman’s collective in Montana. By the end, she is one more discouraging force in Heidi’s life. “I mean, equal rights is one thing, equal pay is one thing, but blaming everything on being a woman is just passé,” she says at one point.
Noah A. Hoch ’11 was well-cast as the obnoxious and charismatic Scoop Rosenbaum, Heidi’s long time lover. His disaffected tone was proof that Heidi should hate him, but his suave stance made her attraction equally convincing.
At times these characters verged on stereotype—a result of the play’s writing that aided the mostly freshman cast. For while it is a portrait of a generation, ”Chronicles” is told through Heidi’s memory, and her own viewpoint colors the impression of her surroundings. Ancillary figures were often played by one actor, as if Heidi grouped her acquaintances into easy categories.
This prism-like view of Heidi’s world carried through in the direction of the play. The Adams Pool space was transformed into a gallery for the occasion, and a well-curated selection of female student art lined the walls—much like it might in Heidi’s apartment. More striking was Alter’s staging. Each scene was posed and set—the characters moved very little—so that they resembled tableaus rather than moving life. Their picture-like qualities both hearkened back to Heidi’s profession and highlighted the stationary condition of her memories. Such small touches were notable, considering “Chronicles” marks Alter’s directorial premiere. Such strong choices ultimately make the play relevant to its college audience.
“Chronicles” is time-stamped by references to specific events and a soundtrack culled from the staples of classic rock. Scoop’s magazine is even called “Boomer” in reference to his peers. For this reason the play could easily feel outdated. What for Wasserstein’s 1988 adult audience would have been familiar, might easily have weighted the college production. But Alter’s direction and the cast’s acting elevate “Chronicles” from a portrait of Baby Boomer women to a larger exploration of fulfillment and happiness.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Like many graduate students at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, Naseem S. Khuri HKS ‘08 had long thought he wanted to effect positive change in the world. But with “Dust Windows,” the debut album from his band Kingsley Flood, Khuri proves to have strayed markedly from the typical Harvard government student’s route of contributing to society. “Dust Windows,” which will be released at the Middle East Club on Saturday, represents both the unconventional turn Khuri has taken with his career and the remarkable continuity of purpose with which he has brought his first major musical endeavor to bear.
Before Khuri had ever seriously considered fronting a band, he thought he would contribute to his community in a more traditional manner. After receiving his graduate degree in Public Policy from the Kennedy School, Khuri became the executive director of Harvard’s Dubai Initiative, a partnership between the Kennedy School and the Dubai School of Government designed to foster the latter’s development.
But, feeling isolated from the very communities he wanted to help, Khuri soon became disillusioned. “I came out of school really wanting to make a large impact,” he says, “and I wasn’t satisfied with the work I was doing. I was missing out on human connection.”
From there, Khuri’s drive to achieve sowed the seeds of the nascent Kingsley Flood. Khuri, who had been playing guitar and writing songs since high school, says he asked then-roommate Nick M. Balkin to “pick up a bass and just see what happened.” Luckily, they clicked musically, Khuri says. A series of fortuitous events, he adds, such as stumbling upon their future drummer in a bar, led them to the other three members of the current band.
The self-described “post-Americana” group is a logical extension of his experience at the Kennedy School, Khuri explains. “The Kennedy School did a great job of urging me to contribute,” he says. “But I found that working in a bureaucracy turned out not to be the best way for me to achieve that. I wanted to connect on a more direct level, and I found that the best way I could do so was by playing music. If having that one-on-one connection means just playing Saturday night gigs, so be it.”
Khuri’s passion for issues confronting his community and the larger world manifests itself in his lyrics, says the band’s guitarist, George B. Hall. “Naseem is a deep writer,” says Hall, “and he brings so many different moods and feelings to the songs.” Additionally, Hall adds, Khuri’s talent allows him to write more about universal experiences than explicit political problems. “Though you could interpret his lyrics politically, he has a good sense not to be overt, and that takes much more skill than merely stating the problems out there,” Hall says.
As Khuri himself states, “The album is based on how various characters in a community navigate the world of haves and have-nots. What’s most important to me is that I’m honest about the experiences of ordinary people.” For example, the song “Roll The Dice,” according to Khuri, is about the naiveté with which middle- and upper-class people often approach working with the poor. The song narrates from the perspective of one such well-intentioned character, the lyrics revealing his cursory assumptions about a life of which he actually knows little: “I always carry quarters for upside-down hats / ...Cuz I know it ain’t so pretty man, it ain’t so safe and so clean / And I do believe I’ve seen ‘em bleed in Time Magazine.”
Aside from fronting the band, Khuri still maintains a day job in Washington, D.C., utilizing his Harvard education as a consultant for conflict management and negotiations training. But he says that while he remains open to whatever possibilities lie ahead in his future international relations career, his heart currently lies with the band. “I’ve found that I complete my role in the community best by making music,” he says. “The Kennedy School did a great job of enhancing my awareness, and it’s given me the drive to really do something.” If all goes as planned, he says, “The band will become my way of living for the greater good.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Every time I come to Boston, I rejoice,” said Roy “Snap Crackle” Haynes as he stepped up to the stage for his birthday concert at Scullers Jazz Club last Friday night. Back in his hometown once more, the legendary jazz drummer offered glimpsed memories of growing up in the city. At the age of seven, he was entranced by the lady next-door playing Gershwin on Sunday nights. As a teenager, he was sent to the principal’s office in Roxbury Memorial High for drumming incessantly on his desk. At 20 years of age, he collected a letter inviting him to join Luis Russell’s band at the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem. He accepted. “The rest,” said Haynes, fresh from his 85th birthday just two weeks ago, “is history.”
And what an exceptional history it is. Haynes’ résumé, forged over nearly seven decades, is to die for. Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Pat Metheny and Chick Corea are among the many luminaries who have continually called on him to help them shine. Haynes credits a lifetime at the forefront of jazz to his natural feel for swing—his drumming was once described by Thelonious Monk as being like “an eight ball right in the side pocket.” His success must also be due to his constant evolution: he has met the needs of each successive jazz generation without ever losing his singular identity.
Joined by his aptly-named “Fountain of Youth” band (Jaleel Shaw on saxophones, David Wong on bass, and Martin Bejerano on piano), Haynes’ concert last Friday showcased his breadth of experience, and his mastery of the stylistic spectrum. His sensitive lightness of touch on the ballad “For All We Know” was contrasted with the face-melting tumult he unleashed on John Coltrane’s lightning-fast “Mr. P.C.” The impeccably poised swing he invoked throughout with his riding right hand was equaled by an absolute command of fluctuating time in a subtly free performance of Pat Metheny’s “Question and Answer.” It is clear that Haynes is no mere accompanist—he reacts to the soloists, throwing their material right back at them, spurring them on to greater heights.
Haynes’ passion for his life and music is infectiously apparent. At the microphone, he exudes a witty enthusiasm. At the drums, his joyful energy seems limitless. Eyes closed with a broad smile spread across his face, he throws his arms high in the air before bringing them snapping down on his high-tuned snare. Haynes never stops moving for an instant. During a wonderfully moody rendition of the Cole Porter classic, “My Heart Belongs to Daddy,” he rocketed the intensity through a magnificent arc: starting at a whisper, he rose to a ferocious height that drowned out the band, before standing up and walking round the stage, tapping out the fading beat on his sticks.
Was my enjoyment inflated out of proportion by my respect for his vigorous old age? Occasionally he’d falter a fraction, and I’d hastily scribble something like, “he’s mellowed; he’s not his former, razor-sharp self.” But this is too critical. His drumming rang with every ounce of his vast experience. Perhaps most telling was his playing during a bass solo. Haynes chose to pare his palette down to just one cymbal. Stripped bare with nowhere to hide, he shone with unobtrusive inventiveness, sending the rhythm skittering into ever more complex patterns. Haynes is still very much the real thing.
The gig ended with a drum solo that was a pounding frenzy of sound. Haynes finished by leaping up from the kit, as if scalded. The audience’s immediate standing ovation was augmented with an impromptu chorus of “Happy Birthday,” accompanied by the band. “Growing up I couldn’t even think I’d still be living at this age,” said Haynes, in a kind farewell; “It feels like a dream... I love it.”

“I’m feeling alive again, alive again,” vocalist Alison Goldfrapp croons breathily on the third track of “Head First,” summing up the album’s vivacious spirit. British duo Goldfrapp’s fifth release, “Head First” is an infectiously bubbly, feel-good 1980s disco-pop infused production. Alison Goldfrapp and producer Will Gregory have experimented with various styles throughout the past 10 years, shifting from ambient electronic pop on their debut “Felt Mountain,” to darker sounds in later albums “Black Cherry” and “Supernature,” and finally to a much mellower, delicate folk-pop in 2007’s “Seventh Tree.” “Head First” is a reawakening, taking Goldfrapp’s energy level to a completely new height and giving them a dance-floor appeal that was absent from “Seventh Tree.” While the new album presents an array of lively, stylized dance hits whose catchy choruses, steady beats, and glittery synths offer instant gratification, the album as a whole is a surprisingly uninventive step backward for a duo that has always been eager to break new ground.
As is readily apparent from the beginning of the album, with its warm and fuzzy opening track “Rocket,” the mysterious, seductive quality that originally set Goldfrapp’s sound apart is nowhere to be found on “Head First.” As Alison sings, “Danger, heartache, something has died,” the musical accompaniment is awkwardly lighthearted. The track is instantly likeable, however, having just the right amount of superficiality to be perfect for dancing and a simple, cheesy, and delightfully repetitive chorus.
In targeting everything enjoyable and addictive about the pop music of the 1980s, Goldfrapp certainly hits the nail on the head. “Head First” is an incredibly cohesive album, evoking the whole era in all of its glory. With touches of ABBA, Pat Benatar, Diana Ross, and even Depeche Mode, it’s overwhelmingly nostalgic. On the surface, the enthusiastic and enticing sound of “Head First” gives it an immediate accessibility that Goldfrapp desperately needed to re-launch themselves into the electro-dance-pop arena. On the other hand, it also continually begs the question, “Haven’t I heard this before?”
Although a good portion of “Head First” radiates happiness, there are a few darker moments that hearken back to the duo’s earlier style. However, Goldfrapp doesn’t quite pull it off like they did with their sultry 2003 hit single “Strict Machine.” “Shiny and Warm” comes close, with a pulsating rhythm that compliments Alison’s eerily beautiful vocals, but the mindless lyrics undercut the song’s efforts. “Hunt” also falls just short. The ethereal synths over which Alison’s consistently strong vocals seem to float would be absolutely mind-blowing if paired with more creative lyrics, but instead, the dull and irritatingly repetitive chorus drags the song down.
Closer “Voicething” stands in sharp contrast with the rest of the album as the only true reference to Goldfrapp’s highly experimental roots, but with five minutes of abstract, wordless vocals and strange sounds, it’s a nauseating experience. While this song may be far more experimental than the other, rather uninventive tracks, its experimentation is misdirected and fails to be enjoyable.
While the music on “Head First” is always fun and energetic, it inevitably sounds like it’s been done before, and the lyrics, though catchy, are often sometimes just a little too mindless, failing to do justice to Alison’s incredible vocals. While “Head First” may not be Goldfrapp’s most innovative or exciting production yet, it’s a near perfect soundtrack for a retro dance party. After Goldfrapp’s sudden detour into a downtempo, folksy, ambient haze on their last album, the ever-changing duo have come back to life. It’s just a little disappointing that this new life is so fervently fixed in the past.

When he wasn’t busy producing a new album for Justin Bieber, Usher found the time to record one of his own. Much like it’s hard to take teenage protégé Bieber seriously, Usher’s sixth record, “Raymond v. Raymond,” struggles to make a sophisticated and grown-up statement.
During the recording of “Raymond v. Raymond,” Usher filed for divorce from his wife Tameka. This event supposedly pushed his songwriting in a more personal, confessional direction. This is a similar formula to the one used on his fourth album, which was actually entitled “Confessions” and followed his separation from his long-term girlfriend, TLC’s Chilli. By reviving this formula, Usher may be hoping to return to the massive success he achieved with “Confessions.” However, “Raymond v. Raymond” is disappointing, both lyrically and emotionally.
Usher’s songwriting staple—sharply produced R&B odes to love, often found in a club—is pretty well known by now, and no amount of personal issues are going to change it. Sticking to this staple, however, is not guaranteed to deliver Usher chart-topping hits. Whereas “Confessions” shifted close to 10 million copies in the U.S. and spawned four number one hits, Usher’s last album, 2008’s “Here I Stand,” failed to reach the success of its predecessor. Songs about love in a club are all well and good, but if you’re going to do the same thing over and over again, it’s essential that it’s done well.
“Raymond v. Raymond” doesn’t contain anything as instantly and inescapably catchy as the hit single “Yeah!” from “Confessions,” but it certainly does have its strong points. Bonus track “More” is actually one of the album’s highlights, and its slick beats and self-assured air are certainly reminiscent of Usher’s past hits. Usher’s core aesthetic reamins intact: most songs feature strong electronic beats as well as an abundance of vocal and instrumental layering, and all of the production aspects assure that there is almost never a tired moment.
Opener “Monstar” is another of the album’s best tracks. Filled with electronic beats, claps, computerized voices—à la Kanye West sampling Daft Punk—piano, and strings layered together, the song continuously builds up a seemingly weightless sound. This is showcased as the chorus chants, “I’m back / Celebrate life,” which seems to be exactly what this song is trying to do.
The music, nevertheless, oftentimes doesn’t make up for the insipid subject matter and silliness of the album’s lyrics, which are the weakest point of “Raymond v. Raymond.” A perfect example of this is “OMG,” featuring and produced by The Black Eyed Peas’ will.i.am, perhaps the most ridiculous track. Another ode to club hookups, the lyrics show that a poet Usher is not, as he laughably attempts to describe the woman he has fallen for by singing, “Honey got a booty like pow, pow, pow / Honey got some boobies like wow, oh, wow.”
Although not as consistently asinine, “Lil Freak,” is likewise incongruous. Its most jarringly out of place aspect is the sampling of “Living for the City,” Stevie Wonder’s anthem about the African-American struggle against poverty and racism. Alongside this, Usher’s deepest lyrics are probably: “You let her put her hands in your pants / Be my little freak,” which hardly feels appropriate next to Wonder’s sincere words.
Between bookends describing his sexual exploits, Usher does actually reach the confessional aspect of the album. “Papers” sounds like a legitimately heartfelt song about the troubles Usher has been facing during his divorce. Going through all of his difficulties with soaring vocals, “I damn near lost my mamma / I been through so much drama / I done turned into the man that I never thought I’d be / I’m ready to sign them papers.” Unlike many of the other songs, “Paper” actually feels like it has soul, a nice change from the rest of the album’s lightweight feel.
Usher manages to stretch out his thin inspiration for over an hour, and many of the tracks prove to be filler. While usually catchy, the lyrics aren’t good enough to bring this “self-confessional” album’s concept off of the ground. What Usher needs isn’t another album of so-called introspection to bring back the success of his past, but some new inventiveness in his career, something that “Raymond v. Raymond” fails to exhibit.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Visitors to the yard on April 18 may be surprised to encounter billowing folds of saffron fabric and monks offering bowls of rice to passers-by. But there’s no need to worry—you’re still in Cambridge. These exotic additions are all a part of this year’s Arts First festival.
The Office for the Arts’ (OFA) annual Public Art Workshop and the Harvard Human Rights Advocates (HHRA) will collaborate on a public art installation with the theme of human rights struggles in Burma. In three meetings, which began on March 9 and will culminate on April 17, the participating artists hope to create a piece that will visually engage viewers, while raising awareness and support for Burma’s current political situation.
“Even though it’s just one installation in one day in Harvard Yard, the impact can be profound,” says Boston artist Gary L. Duehr, the workshop director and an editor for the OFA’s newsletter, “Spectrum.”
The workshop, now in its fifth year, developed as part of an effort to increase the visual arts presence at Arts First. In past years, installations have responded thematically to the setting of Harvard Yard, tackling subjects that affect student life. This is the first time that the workshop has taken a politically charged issue as a starting point.
Maya S. Sugarman ’12, head of the HHRA Burma campaign, first learned about the country’s political situation in a high school history class. She has since become deeply involved in human rights work, spending a gap year teaching Burmese refugees on the Thai border. When she contacted the OFA about doing an installation to raise on-campus awareness, she was introduced to Duehr to collaborate on a project with his public art workshop.
Sugarman’s HHRA campaign primarily focuses on the unjust retention of political prisoners by the Burmese military government, which has held power for 19 years. Among those prisoners is Nobel Prize recipient Aung San Suu Kyi, who was elected Prime Minister of Burma in 1990 but was never allowed to take office. One difficulty Sugarman’s group faces is that activism in the U.S. can yield few concrete results, as the U.S. has very little sway in Burma. However, the HHRA still believes strongly in remaining informed of the country’s political strife, and in utilizing art as a vehicle to spread awareness.
“There are so many people at Harvard with something to say that a lot of messages get lost,” Sugarman says. “Art is a good way to get past that. Art attracts a variety of people who are not necessarily into human rights and creates a consciousness of those issues.”
Duehr, who co-directs a local public art collective, the Invisible Cities Group, and has a permanent piece installed at North Station, believes just as strongly in art’s ability to galvanize viewers. His own work does not tend toward the political but instead toward exploring communication and engaging all five senses through a combination of visual and performance elements. Regarding the workshop, Duehr says, “With this piece, the goal is to bridge the two worlds between preaching and being abstract. We’re trying to connect with people on a human level.... The project is meant to bring viewers out of the realm of spectators and into the realm of action.”
In the preliminary meeting, workshop students experimented with draping saffron material from trees and considered asking exiled Burmese monks to meditate and pass out rice in the yard—an act that references past demonstrations in which monks symbolically overturned rice bowls to express their dissent against the military. Sugarman, who had envisioned a slightly simpler project, was thrilled by the way her ideas grew during the initial dialogue between the artists and activists in the workshop.
“At Harvard, it is usually not fun to work in groups because people have different expectations. But this is a positive collaboration,” she says.
Margaret Min ’12, a VES concentrator involved in the workshop for the second year, admits that she does not know much about Burma but hopes to become informed through her fellow participants.
Of Duehr, Min says, “He’s a really organized person. For him, it was not a social thing, it was ‘let’s do this.’ He’s also really open minded, always takes notes, always listens to us.... He knows what he’s doing. It’s helpful to have him at Harvard.”
In the future, Min hopes that Harvard will put more energy into promoting their public art programs and that more students will take an interest. Counter to what one may expect, she remarks that public art doesn’t just advertise itself—people have to look for it.
“This year there are seven people including myself. Considering the fact that Harvard has 6000 undergrads, that’s pretty low,” Min says. “[But] I think Harvard’s getting there. This is just the beginning of art promotion.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Y. Joy Ding ’10, a Computer Science concentrator, received an email from the script clearance team of the upcoming Facebook movie, she was excited—and totally surprised. As it turned out, Ding, who had designed the poster for the Fall 2009 Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club (HRDC) production of “The Flies,” was asked to sign a release form. The film’s producers had seen and liked her poster and wanted to use it to decorate the set for the dorm room of Facebook creater Mark E. Zuckerberg, formerly of the Class of 2006. “After noticing my poster, the Facebook movie team contacted the HRDC president, who put them in touch with me so I could authorize them to use my poster in their film,” Ding said. “Who knows if it will even make it into the movie, but it was still very exciting to be asked permission to use my work.”
Ding, who has also designed posters and publicity images for such HRDC productions as “The Hyacinth Macaw,” “The Birthday Party,” “Cabaret,” “Metamorphoses,” and “Twelve Angry Men,” is one of many student graphic designers whose work can be found brightening Harvard’s campus at any given time. Yet despite the presence of many graphic designers, the university is almost entirely lacking in formal academic resources for students interested in developing these skills. Instead, students independently seek opportunities to learn and practice graphic design—often by working for extracurricular organizations around campus and businesses in Cambridge.
OUTSIDE THE CURRICULAR BOX
Currently, no specific coursework on graphic design exists in seemingly relevant departments like Computer Science and Visual and Environmental Studies (VES). Interested students receive academic support only through peripherally related courses. “We don’t offer any graphic design courses, but if a student wants to pursue graphic design in the future, VES studio courses are still a helpful foundation,” said Paula Soares, Manager of Academic Programs for VES. Further, the Office of Student Life, which boasts a list of over 413 officially recognized student groups, does not include a single student group explicitly focused on graphic design. The best resources Harvard has to offer its graphic designers are free software downloads: both Adobe InDesign and Adobe Photoshop are offered to students by Harvard’s FAS Information Technology.
Musing on this lack of formal curricular opportunities for graphic designers, Computer Science concentrator Kane Hsieh ’12 said, “I wish departments would offer not classes, but rather, mini-seminars throughout the year, so that students can learn the skills without using up one of their few electives. Right now, I’m probably pretty inefficient when creating images, since I’m just using what I already know.” Christina Q. Guo ’13 echoes this sentiment, saying, “I’ve never heard about any workshops for graphic design, but that would be extremely helpful, especially when you’re just starting out.” Still, incorporating graphic design into the curriculum would not be without its challenges. “I’m not sure what department graphic design would fall under,” Guo added. “And obviously, there’s a limit to how many courses a person can take each semester, so it’d be great if a graphic design course could somehow fulfill a GenEd requirement.”
Given this lack of formal programs for graphic design, a number of extracurricular organizations instead provide relevant training to interested students—regardless of their level of experience. “I’d never done graphic design before, but a few of my friends were doing it for other organizations, so when a CSA [Chinese Students Association] Public Relations board position opened up, I took the opportunity to finally learn graphic design,” Guo said. Later, when Guo was comping the Harvard College Law Society, her new graphic design skills were immediately put to use in creating some publicity posters. Publications like The Harvard Crimson similarly teach students to use design software they might not otherwise learn.
Other student designers, however, come to Harvard with some familiarity with graphic design software. “In high school, I did a lot of journalism,” explains Ding. “My high school was fortunate enough to print a color newspaper with broadsheet, so that’s how I started working with Photoshop and InDesign.” Hsieh jokes that he started doing graphic design work before Harvard because “I just don’t like ugly things.” On a more serious note, he added, “I did photography in high school, and then just started tinkering with photo editing.” For slightly more experienced students, opportunities to advance their existing skill sets are hard to find.
But despite its decidedly creative nature, students say that a background in visual art is not essential for learning graphic design. “Before high school, I only dabbled in drawing, and never took a formal art class in high school,” Guo said. “Anyone can do graphic design, as long as they have a decent aesthetic sense.” For further inspiration, designers like Hsieh often look to the Internet. “You can search for design and typographic trends,” he said. “There are websites which compile user creations, like Webdesigner Depot, Graphic DesignBlog and Web Designer Wall. You can find some crazy creative ideas for business cards on sites like these.”
DESIGN IN DEMAND
Regardless of their experience level, graphic designers are a particularly valuable asset to the various student groups on campus. As a freshman at Harvard, Ding started out doing costume design for HRDC. She soon found her graphic design skills being tapped by directors and producers in the theatre community as they asked her to help create publicity images for their shows. During his own freshman year, Hsieh did the graphic design for Banquet, the annual CSA celebration of Lunar New Year, and also designed posters for a number of smaller social events within the CSA.
The creative process used to develop these images varies slightly according to the type of event and the preferences of the student group hosting it. When creating images for theatre posters, Ding said, “I’ll drop by the rehearsals and talk to the directors to get a feel for the show.” For Hsieh, the cultural board of CSA tells him what kinds of images they have in mind for a given event, and then he creates three or four designs based on their input. “It’s a collaborative process,” he said, “and then the cultural board makes the final decision about which images to use.”
For the production of The Flies, the show’s director envisioned a Western-themed retelling of the original play by Jean-Paul Sartre, so the Harvard production of the show featured a specific aesthetic invoking the American West. Correspondingly, Ding’s poster for the show incorporated this visual motif, and it was this unusual image which captured the attention of the producers of the Facebook movie.
The amount of artistic control given to student graphic designers also varies. “It really depends on the director. Some have very specific visions for the posters, and we’ll meet several times to replicate those images as closely as possible, and others simply come into a meeting with me with a general feeling about what they’re looking for,” Ding said. Ding’s latest project, creating the poster for the HRDC’s upcoming production of “The Pillowman,” actually involves a small picture that the director had drawn as a child. “I think I’m going to incorporate it as the central image,” said Ding, “since the image fits oddly well with the themes of the show even though this drawing was done years ago and was not related to the production at all.”
Often, by the time directors meet with Ding, they will have already given a lot of thought to the visual representation of their shows in publicity materials. Inspiration comes from a number of sources, including the show’s own set design and images of the production from past performances. “Even beautiful images from the Internet or films—like screen shots from movies—can inform the graphic design work for a poster,” she said.
Ironically enough, such digitally-designed posters are easier to disseminate on paper than online. “Publicizing over Harvard email lists is tough, since there are pixel limits,” said Guo. To get around this, the CSA creates and sends posters through MailChimp, an account that allows users to send smaller posters—as well as headers, footers, fonts and other means of visually organizing information—over email lists.
SKILLS FOR BILLS
Beyond the creative and artistic satisfaction involved in creating digital images, graphic design skills can also translate into financial profit for students. Hsieh currently holds a paid position doing Photoshop work for the Harvard Graduate School of Design, a job which builds on the skills he gained doing volunteer graphic design work for student groups and friends. Ding has also found gainful employment, as she is currently paid to work on the Harvard Student Agencies’ Rover iPhone application. The application, which was developed by Winston X. Yan ’10 and Alexander G. Bick ’10, is an iPhone version of “The Unofficial Guide to Harvard.” “I’m a Computer Science concentrator, so I do a lot of the programming for Rover. But since I also do graphic design, I redesigned the user interface and overhauled the look with new icons,” Ding said. “As a programmer, it’s easy to get caught up in the technical aspects and forget the aesthetic elements which make technology beautiful.”
Opportunities for graphic design work at Harvard require a bit of scouting, but these positions can be surprisingly rewarding. “My freshman year, I would just do freelance graphic design work that I’d find on the Student Employment Office website,” Ding said. “But more recently I was hired by Finale Desserts to do a small graphic design project.” Two summers ago, Finale gave Ding several images of desserts and she turned them into icons for the Facebook Gifts application, so people could exchange digital Finale desserts online. In this way, Finale was able to use Ding’s graphic design skills to gain a valuable marketing tool and Ding, in turn, was sweetly rewarded. “They gave me a few hundred dollars of Finale’s gift cards—I bought everyone birthday cakes for the rest of the year!” she said.
Despite the opportunities to profit from graphic design, actual careers in graphic design aren’t necessarily what these students have in mind for the future. “I’m planning on going into law,” said Guo, “so I don’t really see my graphic design skills factoring into my career. But in college, these skills are incredibly useful.”
Guo’s observation rings true. While having such talents has already been noted as an asset in student groups, these skills can further be utilized in students’ individual pursuits. Recently, Hsieh designed the logo for Legata, an Internet start-up business he created with classmates Sasank Konda ’12 and Calvin McEachron ’12.
GRAPHIC GRADS
At the undergraduate level, student groups and paid employment offer aspiring graphic designers a chance to further explore their art. At the Harvard Graduate School of Design (GSD), however, slightly more structured programs exist. In the spring of 2009, world-renowned Norwegian graphic designer and publisher Lars Muller joined the faculty of the GSD for one semester as a guest lecturer in the Department of Architecture. His course “Building Books” examined print media from a perspective of layout and graphic design, and was accompanied by a student exhibition of book projects in the GSD library. While at the GSD, Muller also worked on graphic design for “Ecological Urbanism,” a collection of writings from Harvard professors and other design leaders about urban development and ecological planning in the modern era.
Aspiring designers at Harvard can also learn about graphic design through GSD student publications. For instance, “New Geographies,” a doctoral student journal distributed by Harvard University Press, has featured a different emerging graphic designer in each of its four issues of 2009. In this way, GSD doctoral students are able to highlight new talent in the field of graphic design and enjoy a fresh aesthetic for each issue.
Thus Harvard students interested in graphic design can draw from a few resources for inspiration and support, but ultimately the University provides little support for aspiring graphic designers, particularly those in the College. Still, these students do find artistic satisfaction in their independent pursuits. “Graphic design is great because the time commitment is manageable, and it’s still a creative role,” explains Ding. “It’s really rewarding work.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Abstract figures pulsating with symbolism and emotion; imagery as macabre as it is mesmerizing; dynamic conflagrations of texture and detail: these are the elements of “Ladders to Fire,” a transfixing exhibition of the work of Kayla A. Escobedo ’12.  On display until April 3 in Gallery 263, Escobedo’s art is a masterful amalgamation of unified themes and influences, combined with visceral emotion that is unique to each piece.
“Ladders to Fire” is Escobedo’s second solo exhibition and her first off-campus showing since coming to Harvard. Gallery intern and curator Emily X. L. Xie ’12 arranged the exhibition, selecting a wide variety of Escobedo’s pieces. Her selections include large oil paintings and acrylics, some of which were previously displayed at the artist’s show last semester in the SOCH Penthouse. Additionally, Xie featured Escobedo’s intricately detailed comics, which are being exhibited for the first time.
Escobedo attributes the inspiration for the show’s newer pieces to a summer spent as a studio assistant to Houston-based international artist Trenton Doyle Hancock.
“I already had an interest in comics, but [Hancock] would give me stacks of books every week to look through, so I got introduced to tons of old comics artists and watched a lot of films and had this period of hibernation,” Escobedo says. “I wasn’t making any art, but I just had so much new influence and information stockpiled in my head, so when I got back on campus, I had an explosion of art making.”
This inspiration is tangible in the powerful, emotive imagery that characterizes Escobedo’s artwork. She fuses these components with aesthetic elements gleaned from her influences.
“I’m taking old-timey comic books and the bad stuff that’s in the back of my head and blending the two of them,” Escobedo says. “So you have the comforting old-timey classic feel of the 1920s—you know, the comic book characters with the big eyes and floppy arms—but then there’s this intense sexual charge to it. It’s raw, sort of nasty in a way.”
The fusion is embodied by “The Mourners,” a large acrylic painting that depicts the artist’s corpse falling as significant figures from her life latch onto her. Interspersed throughout the painting are bulbous bodies, cartoon eyes and mouths, and detailed hands and feet. These images evidence Escobedo’s internalization of a comic book aesthetic as she symbolically evokes the figure’s reactions to her death.
In contrast, the artist’s newer work moves away from the symbolism that saturates “The Mourners.”
“In a lot of my stuff now I’m just reaching into the unaccessed places in my mind and pulling things out and then just putting them on canvas,” Escobedo says. “I used to be very uncomfortable with not knowing what something meant... but now I have more of a confidence with just making things and not questioning them.”
The juxtaposition of deliberately symbolic and more instinctive, visceral works lends dynamic heterogeneity to the exhibition. In addition, Escobedo uses a diverse range of media, from pen and ink drawings to acrylic and oil paintings on expansive canvases.
“As a solo show Kayla has a very interesting body of work in that there is a unifying style, but there’s also a huge variation,” Xie says. “So my goal in curating was trying to figure out how to arrange things in a way so that they could give the most meaning to the viewer.”
Xie’s curatorial arrangement optimally displays a series of surreal, sexually charged images. “Garden of Earthly Delights” features nude female figures interacting within a surrealist landscape, while “Erotica” depicts similar figures draped across an imposing, devil-like creature, whose intricate folds of flesh and meticulously detailed features elicit a potent emotional response. Perhaps the most striking of these sexual, unearthly images is “Los Dos Kaylas,” which depicts two faceless, nude figures, their bodies textured with a mélange of colors, perched upon spindly chairs and connected by intertwining heart strings.
Oscillating between abstract and figurative, drenched in symbolism, and at times verging upon the grotesque, Escobedo’s “Ladders to Fire” ignites the intimate gallery space of 263. Her work encompasses both a personal significance and a universal emotional resonance. The exhibition comes at an opportune moment for the artist; according to Escobedo, “I’m taking next year off to write a graphic novel, so [this exhibition] is an amazing way to say goodbye for a while.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week—in the newest addition to the ongoing Cape Wind saga—Massachusetts’s top historic preservation official took a public stand against the alternative-energy project, on grounds that two Native American tribes have ties to the land and water in question. While we understand that certain natural spaces hold significance for specific groups of people, climate change poses a pressing and collective threat to the planet as a whole. It is unlikely that anyone would seek to oppose natural beauty or historic-land preservation in theory; however, such concerns must be weighed against the opportunity to increase sustainability, create jobs, and reduce electricity prices. With these considerations in mind, it is clear that the Cape Wind project should come to fruition.
According to a report by the Charles River Associates, the creation of wind farms would reduce the cost of electricity in New England by $185 million per year and $4.6 billion over 25 years. In the process, it will also create jobs in manufacturing and assembling, among other areas. Given the current state of the economy, job-creating initiatives are vital. Considering New England’s January and February unemployment rates, which show a widespread increase, Cape Wind provides a perfect opportunity to reverse such trends.
Of arguably greater importance, the wind farm promises to steer America toward use of alternative energy. Given that the movement for a wind farm in Nantucket Sound began in 2001 and has been very highly publicized, advocates for climate change mitigation cannot afford to lose this battle. Nor, it seems, can the planet.
While some may argue against Cape Wind because of their ties to Nantucket Sound, these individuals will also reap the benefits of widespread alternative energy usage. Moreover, Cape Wind will help far more people than it hurts. While it will restrict relatively few residents’ view, its economic benefits will reverberate throughout New England. Furthermore, its environmental benefits may be felt worldwide, if other wind farm projects follow the Nantucket example. The collective good, therefore, must be prioritized over localized interests, and such individual sacrifices are necessary in the global fight against climate change.
The concerns voiced by Nantucket residents looking to preserve the cultural history of the area, and Native American tribes with ties to the land, are certainly real to those concerned. However, Nantucket itself has arguably already felt the effects of climate change. The historic Sankaty Head Lighthouse was moved in October, 2007 due to bluff erosion. Beach erosion has threatened the habitat of piping plovers, as well as the houses of residents. By reducing Massachusetts greenhouse gas emissions, Cape Wind would contribute to a global effort toward sustainablilty—a move that could eventually help reduce the rise in sea levels that contribute to erosion. Although it will undoubtedly be hard for many residents of Nantucket to see their Sound visually altered, alternative energy will help prevent the destruction of other historic areas in the long run.

In the wake of the 2000 presidential election, many pundits and voters blamed Ralph Nader for what they perceived as his role in preventing the victory of former Vice President Al Gore ‘69. In their view, Nader drew away votes that would have otherwise been cast for Gore and could have altered the outcome of the extraordinarily close contest. Despite a later study by Harvard Professor B.C. Burden that largely disproved this theory, the controversy illustrates an important feature of American party politics: the abundance of obstacles faced by third-party candidates seeking electoral equality. Third-party candidates represent a viable and principled choice for Americans to express their views; as a result, votes for third parties should be regarded as informed decisions based on political values, rather than meaningless ones based on overly idealistic sentiments.
Objections to third-party candidacies that rest on their tendency to “steal votes” seem to invoke a cynical and underdeveloped view of democratic choice. Democracy is founded on the principle that citizens should choose governments for themselves from among the assorted options; with more options available for selection, therefore, citizens would have greater freedom and flexibility in choosing the leader they most desire. Instead of being restricted to one or two broadly comparable administrations, they would have the liberty to choose from an additional candidate who may be better suited to address their concerns.
In addition to providing another option for voters with specific concerns, the very participation of third-party candidates in campaigns helps to better inform voters and establish a higher level of political discourse. During debates, three candidates with three sets of ideas about governing policies would provide more information to the average voter—and more insights into their opponents’ plans—than would a smaller pool of candidates. Debating with additional opponents enables candidates to explore the nuances of their ideas, defining and distinguishing themselves from a broader field. Having an additional candidate with a well-considered platform compels both politicians and voters to engage more fully with their own ideals and define their political standards.
Finally, there is some value in casting a principled vote for a third-party candidate whose views are closest to one’s own, even if that candidate stands little chance of winning the election. The concept of principled voting is a lost one in American politics; drones of citizens vote for the most charismatic candidate, often without carefully considering the policy implications of their decisions. A recent study by Boaz Shamir indicates that voting preferences are closely correlated with a candidate’s perceived charisma, while Daniel Benjamin performed a behavioral analysis suggesting that “undecided voters choose based on [the charisma that the candidates exude].”
In contrast, third parties are often organized around a coherent set of ideological goals; the Libertarian Party, for example, defines “smaller government” and “lower taxes” as its primary objectives, and the party’s website actually refers to the group as “the Party of Principle.” Voters expressing support for such parties necessarily have a concern for their ideological motives, rather than for their candidate’s charisma or charm. Since this, after all, is the goal of democratic voting—for citizens to vote for, and presumably elect, those representatives whose values and policy preferences will most accord with their own—third-party voters are likely closer to an ideal of democratic decision-making than mainstream party voters ever will be.
Yet objections still arise: A vote for a third-party candidate can counterproductively split votes with the elector’s second-best choice. For example, in the 2000 election, 38 percent of those who voted for Nader would have voted for Gore if Nader had not run, while only 25 percent would have voted for Bush. However, in taking away from Gore’s totals by casting their vote for the Green Party, Nader’s supporters may have prevented their second-best choice from winning the election; the Nader voters ensured that the candidate whose policies were most oppositional to their own was placed in office.
Ignoring the mathematical inaccuracy of the notion that Nader took away enough votes to cost Gore the election, this counterargument poses a difficult choice for the voter. Undoubtedly, the more rational decision is to cast the vote for Gore and ensure that the second-best option takes office. But the principled one is to vote for Nader and the values he represents.
Instead, citizens constantly find themselves choosing between the “lesser of two evils,” picking the choice that offends their values least rather than the one that corresponds to them most. Every citizen has to remember that their vote is their voice and an expression of their values; if their views accord most closely with those of third-party candidates, they should be encouraged to express their support through their vote. Instead of claiming that those supporting third-party candidates are throwing away their vote, we need to recognize the principles behind these votes and the values that they express. In doing so, we uphold the very ideals that make a vote valuable in the first place—its expression of a voice and the opinions that lay behind it.

Alleged deficit reduction from health care reform bill: $1.3 trillion
Size of unfunded liability in Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security: $100 trillion
Leaving the nation’s budget solvent for our generation: priceless
Of all the challenges facing our leaders in Washington, none is more difficult or urgent than the long-term, structural budget deficits resulting from Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. These programs are useful and well-intentioned: They form the bedrock of the American social safety net. Important as they are, however, they have also become exorbitantly expensive.
For perspective, consider that every dollar of tax revenue collected at the federal level in 2009 was used to pay for the cost of entitlement programs. Spending for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, and all other defense and discretionary spending was financed solely by deficit spending. In short, even if we decided that the government’s only job was to manage these entitlement programs and cut all other spending to zero, we’d still only break even—our $12.7 billion of existing national debt would remain unpaid. The magnitude of the problem has become so great that it can no longer be ignored.
Real reform must address these three programs. And it must alter the very structure of the programs, which were created in a time when the U.S. could be certain that the working young would make up a large share of its population. Fortunately, there are three groups in favor of reform: conservative economists, liberal economists, and Republican elected officials. The last group that needs to get on the reform train is Democrats in public office.
In a rare show of bipartisanship, the need for fundamental reform has united disparate factions of academia. In a 2005 paper entitled “Nonpartisan Social Security Reform Plan,” a trio of economists—including a former Bush economic advisor and a senior official in the Obama administration (Kennedy School Professor Jeff Liebman)—propose a plan to ensure the solvency of Social Security by increasing the retirement age, increasing the payroll tax cap, and, most importantly, offering personal retirement accounts that would allow workers to contribute into what is essentially a government-sponsored Individual Retirement Account, investing a mandated amount of their earnings. A nonpartisan analysis by the Congressional Budget Office found that the plan would preserve benefits for retirees for almost 100 years.
A common objection to the addition of personal retirement accounts to Social Security is that allowing Americans to invest and earn interest on part of their Social Security payments might have left many of the elderly bankrupt after the financial meltdown of 2008. However, despite the desire of some to strike fear into the hearts of retirees, a worker retiring today who had been allowed to begin investing his Social Security premiums when starting work 40 years ago would have accrued more money by now than is promised by Social Security.
The plan put forth by Liebman and his colleagues fixes the Social Security solvency problem without requiring draconian tax hikes or damaging benefit cuts. Moreover, it’s not just an academic proposal: public advocates include a number of Congressional Republicans, most notably and recently Paul Ryan (R-Wis.).
So why hasn’t this bipartisan, common sense reform been passed into law? Because Democrats in Congress refuse to acknowledge a problem exists and insist on preserving the “sanctity” of the Social Security system, which is code for wanting the problem to be dealt with by tax increases alone. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) called the issue a crisis “manufactured” by the Bush administration and said Social Security will be safe for “50 years,” ignoring the fact that the system will pay out more this year than it takes in. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), meanwhile, disingenuously claimed that she opposed a plan to introduce personal accounts because she did not want to “bleed Social Security of $2 trillion” conveniently ignoring the fact that this extra $2 trillion would instead be paid to individuals from their own private accounts, with interest.
Medicare is an even more daunting challenge. While economists have proposed common-sense reforms, like health savings accounts that are also supported by Congressional Republicans, Democrats continue to hold back the process. The recently-passed health care reform bill, for example, directly attacks Health Savings Accounts and other consumer-led Medicare innovations that are both important features of the program as it exists today, especially for the poor, and would help mitigate the budgetary problems.
Why are Democrats standing in the way of common sense and smart budgeting? We’ll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they understand the details of the plans. What they don’t seem to understand, however, is the urgency of the problem: Instead of focusing on reforming the parts of the budget that will lead to unbearable costs in the future, Democrats embarked on an ideologically-driven crusade to expand government, exacerbating an already huge budgetary problem by dumping 16 million additional Americans into Medicaid through the recently passed health care bill that actually raises the deficit once accounting gimmicks are corrected for.
After the admitted budgetary excesses of some past Republicans, it appears the Democrats in Congress feel—dare we say it—entitled to push the limits of fiscal sanity in favor of long-sought-after liberal agenda items. They are welcome to set their own priorities. But, on their current path, they ought to be honest about who the true obstructionists to deficit reduction are—themselves.

This semester’s mass-class, Professor Menand’s Art and Thought of the Cold War, included Anatole Broyard’s 1948 article “A Portrait of the Hipster,” the title of which conveys the gist of the remaining six pages. Examination, dissection, analysis, and historicization of cultural movements is hard to do, as they are unfolding and moving from individual to collective manifestations. Lady Gaga’s “Telephone,” however, is the most popular cultural text by which we can begin a discourse on the portrait of the modern Hipster.
The modern Hipster has no set definition, consistent with its legitimacy as an active cultural trend. The one near-universal symptom of Hipsterdom is the scorn with which it is treated by those most associated with it—be they the NYU-educated bakers and bike-messengers of Brooklyn (non-locals), or the documentarians of the scene itself, bloggers, journalists, musicians, and other productive agents. The refusal to self-identify is almost as crucial a feature as this: The singular societal entity that does not loath the Hipster as a manifestation of narcissistic pretention is the multi-national corporation.
A good way to establish a working definition of the contemporary Hipster is through comparison to past social movements that we now identify as counter-cultural, because that is how Hipsterdom understands itself and how it is marketed. The genealogical basis of today’s Hipster is in the Beat Generation. The Beat-Hipster’s legitimizing counter-cultural features were the unconventionality of their semi-nomadic lifestyle, the sexual openness, and commitment to expression freed from formal technique. The music, appropriated from Black Americans, was bebop. Most importantly the Beat-Hipsters were sincere.
The contemporary Hipster has a definite spatial prerogative involving dependable access to amenities required for a comfortable, relevant existence. The outplay of this has been a new wave of gentrification in American cities. There is gender and sexual flexibility in the metropolitan Hipster scene, but this comes with the relative safety of increased mainstream and corporate acceptance of queer identities, which the Beats did not have. The music of Hipsters is the mash-up, which rather than putting forth an original and challenging new style of music, plays off the popularity of different mainstream elements that produces something new, but not original.
The cultural output and its form of expression, though, are key. The contemporary Hipster is acutely self-conscious, and this is why Lady Gaga and what blogger Douglas Haddow has termed Gaga-ism are connected. The Hipster is a product of post-modernity unwinding in general culture to the point of constant self-awareness. The Beat-Hipsters were certainly self-obsessed, but they bore an earnestness and sincerity that is impossible if one’s mental energy is overly devoted to fretting over anticipated acceptance of an ironic costume bobble. Life and public existence as a creative endeavor rather than the eventual outplay of internal development involves active consideration of one’s perception (we all do this), and the contribution of today’s Hipster is this to a new degree, an advanced, unrelenting stage.
The popular treatment of Hipsters involves disdain and pejorative connotations that distort any honest examination. The aforementioned Haddow wrote what is the finest portrayal of the Hipster for an AdBusters article in 2008, but the title alone, “Hipster: The Dead End of Western Civilization,” leaves no doubts about the decided standpoint of the examiner. Too much is lost, however, by relegating Hipsterdom to bitter derision and resignation. It is also, I would argue, impossible to engage modern culture, popular and ‘counter,’ without recognizing prominent ideological and descriptive features marking the modern Hipster.
Bringing us to Gaga’s “Telephone,” which in its first week up had more than 20 million views on YouTube. The relevance of Gaga doesn’t need to be restated here. The “Telephone” video, like Hipsterdom’s underlying ideology, is self-conscious to the point of stylizing that awareness. The video is a celebration of celebrity qua celebrity, as well as an amalgamation of different cultural allusions, the familiarity of which render the viewer comfortable. ‘Telephone’ is pop music with the sizeable development of its use of brands like Miracle Whip, Virgin Mobile and Diet Coke in the video medium. The pieces of corporate sponsorship are not snuck-in and normalized, but focal points. Similarly, the self-awareness of multi-lingual subtitles and the reference to rumors of Gaga’s male genitalia are post-modernity’s most glamorous public manifestation in their use of the discourse around the text being part of the end product. And like the prevalence of Urban Outfitters and American Apparel as purveyors of the Hipster v-neck t-shirt, the video and celebrity are the beneficiaries of corporate acceptance. The pan-sexuality of Gaga is ‘counter-cultural’ to the extent that her work maintains corporate sponsorship, the same way that grungy-looking Hipster flannel is the outcome of either time spent thrifting or money, not neglect and use.
Whatever the feelings toward a cultural trend noteworthy because of its appropriation of other cultural outputs may be, the Hipster needs to be legitimized in mainstream discourse, if for no other reason than for a better understanding of where we are as a society.

University Health Services’ biyearly student health assessment—which was distributed to undergraduates last Friday via e-mail—has undergone noteworthy revisions since it was last administered in 2008.
Wellness Center Director Jeanne M. Mahon said that the alterations to the poll—which asks about students’ behavioral and physical health as well as their awareness of programs offered by UHS—were targeted toward improving the quality of data UHS receives from the survey.
In the previous five cycles of the poll, UHS had used the exact questions from the National College Health Assessment, a widely-used survey created by the American College Health Association. But this year, Mahon said, UHS worked with other Ivy League universities—particularly the University of Pennsylvania—to create a survey more directly tailored to its students.
Mahon, who was involved in the editing process, said that administrators at UHS had opted to exclude questions of less relevance to Harvard students, such as those about student driving habits while at college.
She added that those editing the survey had aimed to “look at many different areas, and formulate our own questions, some of which were similar to those in the national survey and some that we wanted to include for Harvard.”
In addition to a change to the content of the poll, students who complete the survey were able to choose to receive a five-dollar J.P. Licks gift card or make a five-dollar donation to a Haitian orphanage. In previous years, only a small portion of students received rewards, and previously there has not been a philanthropic option.
UHS Director David S. Rosenthal ’59 said that UHS officials hoped that the new rewards program would entice more students to participate in the survey.
According to Rosenthal, about 1,140 students have completed the survey since last Friday, roughly two thirds of whom have opted to donate to Haiti. Rosenthal added that the current response numbers comprise a little less than half of the students needed to meet the response rate target of 40 percent. The assessment will remain open for another week.
“I think the most important thing is trying to get a good percentage of students to fill out the form,” Rosenthal said. “We can always see some things just by people coming into UHS, but it doesn’t give us a full picture.”

Roughly a week after winning the battle over health care reform, the Obama administration is set to nominate a Harvard knight to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, according to Associated Press reports attributed to sources within the administration.
Donald M. Berwick ’68, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health and Harvard Medical School who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2005, will be the first permanent chief executive to lead the agency since 2006, when Mark B. McClellan resigned.
Arnold M. Epstein, Berwick’s longtime colleague at the School of Public Health, expressed high praise for Berwick.
Epstein, who chairs the Department of Health Policy and Management, described Berwick as having tremendous experience and said that he believes that Berwick will be very effective. Berwick is “a visionary leader in health policy, a compelling thinker and a wonderful teacher and lecturer,” he said.
Berwick could not be reached for comment yesterday.
Berwick will bring expertise in health care reform to the position, as he received his honorary knighthood for his efforts in improving Britain’s National Health Service under former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair.
He has also garnered extensive recognition for his work on this side of the pond. Berwick was appointed to serve on the President’s Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health Care Industry during the Clinton administration. At the same time, he was chair of the Health Services Research Review Study Section of the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, now called the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.
Berwick is also the President and CEO of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, a nonprofit focused on increasing the quality of patient care throughout the world.

Andres Castro Samayoa ’10 will help facilitate some of the College’s largest events next year—including Yardfest and the Harvard-Yale pep rally—as the Fellow for Student Life, the Office of Student Life announced yesterday.
Chosen to fill the position colloquially known as “fun czar,” Castro Samayoa will be charged with supporting logistics and student groups focused on organizing social events such as the College Events Board, the First-Year Social Committee, and House Committees.
“Andres brings a wonderful combination of advising skills and event management experience,” Assistant Dean of Harvard College for Student Life David R. Friedrich wrote in a press release. “His passion for the field of student affairs and desire to support leadership development among student leaders along with a commitment to creating inclusive events make him a terrific addition to the Office of Student Life.”
Castro Samayoa will arrive in his new role with experience advising his fellow students and promoting diversity initiatives. Over the course of his undergraduate career, Castro Samayoa has served as a senior student intern at the Harvard College Women’s Center, a peer advising fellow, and a co-president of the Harvard-Radcliffe Women’s Leadership Project.
The current fun czarina Sarah J. Sidwell ’09 was a former hospitality chair on the Harvard Concert Commission, a room reservations coordinator at the College Dean’s Office, and a member of the Advisory Board of the Student Organization Center at Hilles.
In his new position, which he is set to begin on July 1, Castro Samayoa said he hopes to balance two main priorities as fun czar.
“I think one of my main concerns and something that I always think about is how do you create a campus that’s welcoming for everyone,” he said. “One of the things that’s so important for Harvard in terms of diversity is how do you put on programming that’s going to be exciting for everyone. Another thing is how do you, as an administrator, develop leadership that will be useful across the College.”
Castro Samayoa said that this role will allow him to pursue his interest in higher education.
“It’s going to be a really nice way for me to acquaint with the general questions that are happening with the field of higher education and administration, like how do you build community across the campus and how do you make sure everyone across the campus feels welcomed,” he said.
The position of fun czar was created in 2004 when Zachary A. Corker ’04 was named special assistant to the dean for social programming, receiving coverage from outlets ranging from Reuters to “The O’Reilly Factor.” The role currently has the title of Campus Life Fellow.

The departure of former studio painting lecturer Nancy Mitchnik last spring left a vacancy in the department that denied VES students—especially students interested in creating a body of paintings for their theses—the opportunity to develop a long term relationship with an instructor.
Mitchnik initially came to Harvard as a visiting professor and was appointed senior preceptor and a studio arts lecturer in 1998.
After 10 years in the position, she left last spring because she could only hold her five-year lecturer appointment for two terms.
Garber told The Crimson last spring that she hoped to eventually create a tenured faculty position to teach studio painting, but the current financial constraints faced by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences prohibited that option for the time being.
In the past, the frequent turnover of visiting professors—who typically remain in the department for one to three years—has resulted in a lack of continuity for painting students.
Patrick A. Gordon ’11, who is pursuing a secondary field in VES, said that a tenure-track professor would provide “stability” in the department.
“I have colleagues who will be working on their theses next semester and do not know who their advisor will be,” Gordon wrote in an e-mail, adding that a close relationship with a thesis advisor is especially important for a creative thesis.
VES concentrator Julia A. F. Rooney ’11, who plans to create a body of paintings on the subject of Italian cities for her thesis, said that having a thesis advisor with whom she had worked before would help her to channel “conflicting and contradictory voices” into a coherent project.
“I don’t think tenure in general is the best thing, but I also think it is very problematic to have these three-year positions or these visiting positions where someone comes in for a year and then they are gone,” she said
At the same time, Rooney said she still sees value in the circuit of visiting professors in the VES department because the system makes it possible to incorporate working artists into the department, providing students with a diversity of perspectives.
“We get a lot of working artists who we probably wouldn’t be able to get otherwise,” Rooney said, though she added, “But for the students it’s really hard.”

Jason S. Wien ’13 was visiting Northwestern University, the school he had committed to attending, when he got the call.
Katie N. Rice ’14 had already attended her freshman orientation program at the University of Arizona, and Emily M. Orlins ’11 had learned the name of her roommate at Cornell University.
These students’ college plans were set—until they got a call from Harvard.
We don’t have room for you in the freshman class entering this fall, Harvard told them. But if you’re willing to wait a year, you’re invited to attend.
‘A’ STUDENT TO Z-LIST
Each year, Harvard offers admission to a select group of students—known among admissions officers as the “Z-list”—on the condition that they take a mandatory year off before enrolling in the College.
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 says that of the 60 to 100 students in each class who take a gap year before coming to Harvard, roughly half do so voluntarily. The other half were Z-listed.
Fitzsimmons says that although the practice of Z-listing dates back to the early 1970s, the number of Z-listed students has increased over the years. In 2002, Director of Admissions Marlyn E. McGrath ’70-’73 told The Crimson that there were 20 Z-listed students in each class. Today, that number has reached 30 to 50.
The term Z-list was coined by the office’s computer technicians due to the fact that these students are the final group to be admitted each year. After regular decisions and waitlist admissions have been made, Fitzsimmons says there are always more students the admissions office would like to accept. These students are offered a spot on the Z-list.
“We are 100 percent sure that we want them here next year, not 99 percent,” Fitzsimmons says of the Z-listed students. “We never quite know what next year’s applicant pool is going to bring.”
Samuel B. Novey ’11 says that when he got a call telling him he’d been Z-listed, “[the admissions officer] made it sound like I was trying to book a hotel. She literally said, ‘Next year we may have a bed available.’”
But Fitzsimmions admits that many find this system illogical, since the 30 to 50 beds that would be needed to house Z-listers in the entering class are the same beds being filled by last year’s Z-listers.
“We all know that this is a zero-sum game,” Fitzsimmons says.
FILLING THE GAP
Given a year to spend in nearly any way they choose—apart from enrolling at another academic institution for credit—this group of students comes to Harvard with a wide variety of experiences under their belts.
Some worked—in a company that makes video games, in a rock climbing gym, on a UPS delivery truck, in a neuroscience lab full of monkeys, and on Capitol Hill, to name a few jobs. Some volunteered for charities aiding refugees, cancer patients, and citizens of impoverished nations. Many of them traveled. Collectively, the students interviewed for this article visited 35 countries, spanning every continent but Antarctica.
“I’ve ridden a camel in Timbuktu. I feel like life is complete now,” says Elizabeth M. Letvin ’13.
William N. Forster ’13 says that the sauteed grub intestines that he ate in a remote Ecuadorean  village during his gap year tasted “better than the armadillo.”
Nearly all of the students say that their gap years were extremely rewarding and that they would recommend the experience to other incoming college students.
Johnny F. Bowman ’11 says he was “pissed off” when he first learned he had been Z-listed.
But he says that that feeling changed once he saw the possibilities afforded by an extra year between high school and college.
“Once I realized I can do whatever I want to do, it was the most mind-opening realization and subsequent experience of my life,” Bowman says.
Many students say that taking a gap year gave them a chance to unwind after working assiduously throughout high school, and that spending a year away from academics changed their perspective on college.
“Every day I say ‘Yes! I’m at college! More college today!’” says Novey, who worked on a congressional campaign during his gap year and then became a congressional staffer when his candidate won the election. “You could go weeks without seeing a girl your age in D.C. It teaches you to appreciate that you have a built-in social scene.”
Others say their year off allowed them to discover academic interests that they didn’t know they had.
For example, Quentin Z. Auerbach ’11 says that the culinary interest which he developed by taking cooking classes during his gap year led him to choose food policy as the topic of his social studies thesis.
Asher M. Lipson ’12 had never studied French before traveling to France during his year off. Now, he’s concentrating in Romance Languages and Literatures, a decision he says he doubts he would have made otherwise.
A LEGACY LIST?
While Z-listed students bring a wide range of interests and experiences to Harvard, many people charge that they are similar in two ways—the Z-list has long had a reputation for consisting predominantly of affluent students and Harvard legacies.
Of the 28 students interviewed by The Crimson for this story, 18 have parents who attended Harvard. All but four receive no financial aid from the College, while about 70 percent of the student body receives aid from Harvard.
John W. Anderson, co-director of college counseling at the elite boarding school Phillips Academy in Andover, said that of the Andover students who are Z-listed, “a very, very, very high percent” are legacies.
“I think Harvard does have a strong institutional priority in admitting Harvard sons and daughters,” Anderson says. “[Z-listing] is a good way of accomplishing part of that institutional priority.”
According to Fitzsimmons, Harvard does not aim to use the Z-list to admit legacy students. Instead, he says, the Z-list contains a greater proportion of legacies than the class in general since legacy students might be more willing to accept a spot on the Z-list.
However, Fitzsimmons says the yield for the Z-list is about 67 to 70 percent—not much lower than the 76 percent overall yield that the College reported for the Class of 2013.
Fitzsimmons says that Z-list admissions, like all admissions decisions, are need-blind. However, he says that the cost of funding a year off from school has deterred some students from accepting a Z-list spot.
“Harvard should take into account the students who they’re asking to take a year off and make sure that their families are able to do it,” says a student who wished to remain anonymous, since she says that the Z-list “gives off an impression that is radically different from who I am.”
She receives a full scholarship from Harvard, and she says that it was difficult for her mother to have her living at home a year longer than expected.
Maturity is also frequently cited as a potential rationale behind Z-listing. But according to Fitzsimmons, the College simply views Z-listed students as “good candidates” that it would like to enroll.
“Very rarely do we say to ourselves, maturity is an issue,” Fitzsimmons says.
While some schools such as Middlebury College and the University of Southern California admit students on the condition that they enroll in the spring semester, when beds have been vacated by those who study abroad in the spring or graduate a semester early, Harvard’s practice of requiring students to defer for a year may be unique.
“Harvard can sit back and say, ‘We can do this because we’re Harvard.’” says Stuart Clutterbuck, a guidance counselor at Bergen County Academies, a top magnet high school in New Jersey. He speculates that high school students would be unlikely to accept a one-year deferral at a less prestigious institution.
Despite the secrecy and stigma that some students say accompany being Z-listed, most say they are glad for the opportunity to take a year off before coming to Harvard.
“I’m grateful that I was on the Z-list,” says Madeline S. Peskoe ’14, who has spent this year in Senegal and Argentina and will enter Harvard in the fall. “There’s no way that I would have done this on my own. It was the extra kick that I needed to get off the track. Thanks, Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard undergraduates received over $2.6 million in grant funding for summer projects last week, but this year’s grant applicants faced increased competition as more students searched for alternatives to paid internships in light of continued weak economic conditions.
“We had the same amount of money, but an economy that was not too strong, so more students were trying for funding,” said Robin Mount, director of the Office of Career, Research, and International Opportunities.
In years when more internships were available, fewer students turned to the grants provided by the College, administrators said.
“A lot of them would have gotten picked off by a paid opportunity,” Mount said.
Most of the funding went out on Friday, when just over 400 students were offered a share of $2 million from the David Rockefeller International Experience Grant, which funds overseas student experiences that span eight weeks or longer.
Last year, 900 students applied for the Rockefeller grant, but this year saw 1,028 applications according to Erin E. Goodman, the assistant director of career, research, and international opportunities at the Office of Career Services.
This is the second year that students have been able to apply for the David Rockefeller grant—which was established by a gift from David Rockefeller ’36, who plans to donate money annually to enable undergraduates to take part in a significant international experience.
Besides the Rockefeller grant, about $600,000 were awarded to students through the Fellowships Office at OCS, which recently announced the recipients of the Weissman International Internship Program grant, Herchel Smith Harvard Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship, David Roux Fund Grants, and the Alex G. Booth ’30 Fund Fellowships, along with several smaller fellowships. About 350 students applied for those four grants, and 146 recipients were selected, administrators said.
The Harvard College Program for Research in Science and Engineering also offered spots to approximately 140 students a week ago, according to Mount, and many of Harvard’s centers announced summer grant awards as well in the past week.
Nancy Saunders, the associate director of undergraduate advising for OCS, estimated that Harvard gives out a total of about $4 million in grant money for the summer.
But this sum is not enough to guarantee every Harvard undergraduate funding this summer, administrators said, so OCS is planning programming for students who are still looking for a productive way to spend their summer.
For students who were unable to find funding for their summer projects, Saunders suggested another solution.
“We’re going to encourage students to sandwich their learning opportunity with an earning opportunity,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though aspiring Harvard students may spend this week mired in uncertainty as they wait for admission decisions on April 1, one thing is almost certain: more admitted students than ever before will come to Harvard with the hope of pursuing engineering and applied science.
Cited by Harvard Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 as one of three central trends driving an increase in applications to Harvard, the rise in applicants interested in these fields has been all but meteoric since the establishment of an independent School of Engineering and Applied Sciences almost three years ago.
Previously, when SEAS was still the Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the number of applicants interested in engineering held steady at about 2,500 each year. But over the course of the next three years, the admissions committee has seen a 68 percent surge in applicants who list their primary interest as engineering sciences, during a period in which the total number of applicants to Harvard has risen by about only 11 percent.
The increase, while significant, is not wholly unexpected. The College admissions staff has maintained a concerted effort to publicize the creation of SEAS, striving to dispel the notion that Harvard is primarily a school for the liberal arts, according to Fitzsimmons. This undertaking—coming at a time when national interest in science and technology is rising—appears to have been successful.
But the increase in applicants—and thus, potential concentrators—will challenge SEAS in new ways. While SEAS Dean Cherry A. Murray detailed plans to expand the engineering school during an “All-Hands” Meeting earlier this month, she also noted that the school’s space was already “severely constrained.”
“Any future growth will be done in such a way to ensure we can support the increase in the number of students,” Murray said in an e-mailed statement. ‘We plan to grow without growing apart.”
INCREASED VISIBILITY
Harvard has aggressively advertised the new opportunities offered by the creation of SEAS in its on-campus information sessions and in its outreach efforts to high schools in dozens of cities across the country, according to Fitzsimmons.
“Basically any time we saw students, we talked about the new school,” Fitzsimmons says. He adds that the recent creation of majors in Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology and Biomedical Engineering gave admissions officers additional talking points to entice students interested in applied science.
“There are lots of people who have this outdated stereotype of Harvard as pretty much humanities and social science,” Fitzsimmons says. “It obviously attracts everybody to have strong engineering. It’s a huge asset.”
Prior to the creation of SEAS, engineering concentrators studied within the Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences, which Computer Science professor and former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 describes as “halfway between a department and a school.”
As Lewis explains, the 2008 chartering of SEAS broadly increased awareness of engineering at Harvard. And because Harvard does not consider engineering applicants separately—unlike other colleges including Cornell and Columbia—the creation of SEAS allowed Harvard to offer the unique opportunity to study engineering within an independent school without having to make a decisive career choice as a high school senior.
“Harvard has the advantage that to be an engineer here, you simply apply to be a student at Harvard College, with all of the other resources that Harvard College students have,” Lewis says.
At the same that the admissions office has been advertising SEAS, individuals within the school itself have worked to increase the visibility of Harvard engineering and the various research projects undertaken in the field.
According to former Dean of SEAS Venkatesh “Venky” Narayanamurti, the establishment of the school allowed for greater outreach efforts to potential students through the SEAS Communications Office. These efforts included redesigning the official Web site, hosting Web chats, and calling high school seniors.
SEAS also makes additional recruiting efforts once students are admitted to Harvard. According to Lewis, the school attempts to have a faculty member call or e-mail every admitted student who has listed engineering as his or her primary interest.
NATIONAL TRENDS
Some part of the success of Harvard’s outreach efforts may be attributed to the increased national interest in engineering and applied science in recent years.
According to annual surveys of students entering four-year colleges conducted by the Higher Education Research Institute at University of California, Los Angeles, interest in engineering began rising again in 2008 following a multi-year decline. Overall interest in science, engineering, and technology also remains significantly elevated from levels in the 1980s and early 1990s.
“I suspect shifting socioeconomic trends (the economy, the exposure of today’s student to technology) and the greater interest in students who really want to make a difference in the world solving societal problems is attracting more concentrators in engineering,” Murray wrote.
MIT Dean of Admissions Stuart Schmill echoes this sentiment, noting a rising awareness of the value of an engineering education.
“I think that there is broad recognition in the country, particularly, among high school students, about the importance of having a strong background in science and technology to do anything in the future,” Schmill says.
But the dynamic growth in engineering at Harvard may be exceptional even compared to other institutions. According to Schmill, the proportion of MIT applicants who express an interest in engineering has remained relatively constant over the past few years, while Harvard admissions statistics reveal that the proportion of Harvard applicants interested in the field has soared.
BENEFITS AND CHALLENGES
Yet with potential continued growth among concentrators within SEAS, the school faces the possibility that facilities might run short.
But both Venky and Murray dismiss notions that the increase in the size of the student body would be allowed to strain the resources of the faculty.
Venky says that it is important to have space for teaching labs, and that he sees the availability of physical space as the biggest limitation.
“We will have to add more faculty and more space, or stop the growth,” Venky says.
Murray wrote that as of yet, SEAS has “been able to handle the increase in concentrators without a dramatic drop in the faculty to student ratio.”
As she signaled in her “All-Hands” meeting on Mar. 1, SEAS plans to add an additional 50 full-time equivalent faculty members over the next 10 years to support continued expansion.
And as President of the Harvard College Engineering Society Evelyn J. Park ’11 says, the growth in engineering interest may improve the overall experience of undergraduate engineering concentrators beyond expanding their academic opportunities.
“Right now, we’re one of the smaller concentrations on campus, and you get a lot of questions like, “Why are you doing engineering at Harvard when MIT is just down the street?’” Park says. “The Engineering Society has been trying to build up more spirit and a sense of community among the engineers, and I think having more people will definitely help with that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s chapter of Scholars at Risk is investigating the travel restrictions placed on Beijing Film Academy professor Cui Weiping, who was denied permission to visit the United States last week by the Academy.
In a letter sent last Friday to officials including U.S. Chinese ambassadors, Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs Yang Jiechi, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Scholars at Risk called for a public disclosure of the reasons for restricting her travel and, if there are no official reasons, to approve her requests for future travel.
Cui was scheduled to give a lecture at Harvard’s Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies today, following a conference in Philadelphia. But last Wednesday, the director of the Beijing Film Academy informed her that she was forbidden to travel, which Cui attributed to her advocacy of human rights and free speech.
Cui had been warned repeatedly for “transgressions” including posting social criticism pieces on her blog, conducting seminars on the Tiananmen Square Protests, and sending Twitter messages about other scholars who have been persecuted for supporting human rights, according to a New York Times article.
Cui’s Harvard lecture was to discuss trials of Chinese intellectuals including Liu Xiaobo, who was sentenced in December to eleven years in prison for acts of “subversion” such as petitioning for constitutional reform and free elections. Cui surveyed over 100 intellectuals regarding the sentence and then published her findings on Twitter.
In the letters to U.S. and Chinese authorities, Scholars at Risk identifies as its central concern the challenges faced by intellectuals, stating, “The apparent restricting of Professor Cui’s travel suggests serious concerns...about intimidation of intellectuals generally in China.”
Scholars at Risk, an international network of academic institutions and individuals, aims to raise awareness of human rights and free speech violations around the world, principally by circulating alerts. At Harvard, the chapter is part of the University Committee on Human Rights Studies.
Yesterday, Scholars at Risk urged its affiliates to send letters, e-mails, and faxes of their own to the recipients of the organization’s letter.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Recent Harvard PhD graduates are being tapped to relieve teaching responsibilities formerly covered by visiting faculty across the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, as departments cut back on the high costs of employing professors from outside the University.
Last year, Dean of FAS Michael D. Smith imposed a near-total freeze on hiring visiting professors, depriving departments of a crucial tool for meeting the teaching and advising demands placed on their faculty members.
Although this year has seen some repeals of budgeting measures implemented last year—including a renewed search for new faculty—Smith said in an interview with The Crimson earlier this month that the funds allocated for visiting faculty will not be increased.
“Visiting professors will not be more common on campus,” Smith said. “We don’t have discretionary funds to bring more.”
In better times, said History Department Chair Lizabeth Cohen, the Department might have had the opportunity to use visiting professors to temporarily take over courses for professors on leave. In the current financial climate, it is increasingly relying on College Fellows—scholars who have just completed their graduate education at Harvard.
According to Cohen, the College Fellows program—which was created last year to offer research positions to graduate students struggling to find jobs—benefits undergraduate education as well, because recent graduates are familiar with Harvard’s procedures and standards.
The College Fellows program will expand this year, despite limitations that prevent the recent graduates from acting as the head professor for a class.
As a result, some departments expressed a concern that the restrictions on visiting faculty would limit course offerings, and that College Fellows are not adequate direct replacements.
Nancy L. Rosenblum, chair of the Government Department, said that the administration has approved only enough of a “visitor budget adequate to meet our most basic needs.” She added that the limited funds entirely precluded bringing in faculty from other schools of the University, because the department must cover the compensation costs for these professors—often higher than for many visiting professors.
In the past, professors affiliated with campus centers such the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs taught Government classes at no cost to the department. But under the new FAS budgetary guidances, centers must consult with FAS administrators to ensure that teaching duties are allocated in line with FAS’s core priorities.
Rosenblum said she is concerned that appointing teachers to Government classes may not be considered a core priority, though she did recently receive approval for a third College Fellow.
She said she will plan next year’s teaching assignments assuming that the centers will not allocate any to her department.
“We are all confused,” Rosenblum said.
On the other hand, the Economics Department will draw four visiting faculty for the coming academic year, which will enable it to restart its popular junior seminar program. But, according to Economics Department Chair John Y. Campbell, two of the visitors will fill endowed positions that rotate annually among departments.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the midst of last year’s financial crisis, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith assembled six “working groups” to establish top Faculty priorities.
At the time, facing a budget deficit of over $200 million, Smith presented these groups as crucial for ensuring the long-term fiscal health of the University’s largest school.
But with the massive budget trimming process now entering a final stage where the decisions of the dean himself will be paramount, the role and efficacy of the de-centralized working groups—representing the three FAS academic divisions, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and the College—as well as their continued relevance to the process remain an open question.
In a letter sent to administrators last month outlining the plan for the coming budgeting process, Dean of Administration and Finance Leslie A. Kirwan ’79 clarified the administration’s current understanding of the working groups’ role, while vowing to adhere more conscientiously to a budgeting tack, embraced over the past year, known as the ”first-dollar principle,” in which restricted funds are spent on a unit’s priorities before unrestricted funds.
“The Priority Working Groups affirmed that funding for core academic priorities must come first. This [first-dollar] approach is an extension of that direction,” Kirwan wrote, suggesting that the FAS administration is taking a broad interpretation of the working groups’ recommendations rather than implementing them line by line.
‘NOT AT LIBERTY’
Administrators and members of the groups have been hesitant to provide concrete examples of suggestions made in their working group reports, which were all handed over to Smith by the end of the fall semester, saying that working group members would only exercise the freedom to find truly creative and bold solutions if they were guaranteed privacy.
While individuals who were not members of the working groups were consulted regarding specific ideas, the working group reports were never released, and there is no plan to make them public going forward.
“To be honest, I’m not at liberty to say [what the report said],” said Sociology Chair Robert J. Sampson, who sat on the Social Science working group, in an interview last week. “It’s in a sense irresponsible to prematurely release information that hasn’t been vetted.”
But some of the working groups’ suggestions have been made public. Smith has discussed the likelihood of using outside grants that science professors receive for their research to pay parts of their salary by the time the Faculty reaches budgeting for 2011-2012—an idea proposed in the working group of FAS’s science division.
Doing so would “result in substantial personnel cost savings for FAS,” according to the official FAS Planning Web site, which specifies that the current salary levels would remain the same and that “FAS savings could be shared with faculty through additional research support.”
Other ideas that will be implemented include an update of the Registrar’s system so that courses may be more conveniently cross-listed, linking fundraising efforts to FAS goals, and organizing a new, more uniform system within FAS for providing research funds to faculty.
BUCKETS AND FUEL
Smith first announced that he would be forming the working groups at a town hall-style meeting in April 2009 as a way to involve faculty members in the monumental reduction of what was then a $220 million deficit.
But by the end of the summer, several of the newly coined working groups had yet to meet, even as the deficit was slashed in half. Still, Smith reiterated their crucial role in the ongoing budgeting process.
“We do need your ideas. We do need your participation. We do need the recommendations that will come out of the working groups,” Smith said at an open forum in September.
Though some groups progressed faster than others—the Social Sciences division worked particularly quickly, according to members interviewed last spring—all of the groups had submitted their list of budget-saving recommendations by the end of the semester, more than two months after the original Halloween deadline.
At the February Faculty meeting, Smith presented his preliminary extractions from the working groups’ findings, referencing a carefully prepared Power Point presentation. But the specifics of the groups’ recommendations remained elusive. Smith said only that they had been divided into three “buckets”—ranging from items that were most feasible, for which he would launch “targeted implementation groups,” items that “would be discussed further,” and items that would be tabled indefinitely.
Also at the meeting, Smith announced that the FAS deficit had fallen to $80 million—a drop of an additional $30 million from the planned upon $110 million.
“It’s really clear that the ideas within the FAS are what are fueling us here,” Smith said at the meeting, adding that the “strategy” for budgeting had not changed despite the optimistic budget figures.
‘IN THE HANDS OF THE DEAN’
Following the February Faculty meeting, the dean’s office posted a select set of recommendations that arose out of the budget streamlining process on the newly created FAS Planning Web site. The site noted that FAS had entered an extended “third phase” in its response, following immediate cost-cutting measures and administrative restructuring.
But the FAS Web site, the locus of the bulk of Smith’s communications about the working groups’ activity, still includes outdated information. Some groups list incorrect members, and some list members who, in interviews with The Crimson, were entirely unaware of their membership. The site also identifies a SEAS working group that was ultimately folded into a standing Steering Committee led by the Dean of the school.
Since the February meeting, new working group proposals have not been posted and the subject of the groups was not breached at the subsequent Faculty meeting, painting a dubious picture of their staying power in the long-term. According to FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal, the planning Web site will be updated in the next few weeks.
Neal emphasized that the third phase will be a long-term process—a process for which, some professors said, Smith’s centralized oversight is now the key factor.
Government Professor Daniel P. Carpenter, who served on the priority working group for the Social Sciences, called it “one of the most productive administrative exercises I’ve ever been involved in.” He said that the shift from group recommendations to dean-level decisions appeared consistent with the spirit of the process.
Carpenter said that the goal of the working groups was never to legislate or mandate, but rather to offer guidelines—or even boundaries—around the dean’s approach. The dean has final word, Carpenter said, but the working group gave divisional members the opportunity to voice their concerns and delineate specific areas that should not be cut. “It’s not absolute agenda setting,” he said. “But partial agenda shaping.”
Said Sampson, “It’s in the hands of the dean.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every college athlete dreams of one thing: winning a national championship. Sophomore co-captain Caroline Vloka made that dream a reality this past Saturday at the fencing NCAA championships. Her national title in the sabre and first-team All-America honor were especially sweet because they were laced with 10-years worth of retribution.
This weekend, Vloka led her team to a fifth place finish at the NCAA Championships at Harvard’s Gordon track, with a 15-13 victory in the individual finals over long time rival, Beijing bronze medalist, and Duke sophomore Becca Ward.
“Becca Ward and I have been fencing each other for years,” Vloka said. “We’re the same age, so… we’ve been competing since U-10.”
The history between Vloka and Ward is extensive, including many matchups on the national and even international level. At the 2006 U-17 world championships, Ward forged a comeback victory against Vloka to win the gold medal, 15-14. Last year, in the finals of the NCAA Championships, Ward defeated Vloka again, this time by a decisive score of 15-4. This Saturday, however, it was Vloka that would come out on the winning end of a thrilling back-and-forth contest.
“Caroline was successful, because she was really working hard for every point,” said sophomore saber Valentin Staller, who garnered a spot on the All-America second team with a sixth place finish this weekend. “What she did extremely well was… sort of getting Becca into a rhythm and then breaking it… She was able to change things up at the last second and score a few points that way.”
Last year’s finish left Vloka unsatisfied and forced her to enter this year with a different, more effective mentality.
“Instead of coming in being scared of her, I was really [mad] about last year because last year she kind of embarrassed me,” Vloka said. “That anger gave me the determination and intensity that I needed.”
The long rivalry provided Vloka with the motivation to end her winless drought against Ward.
“We have a lot of history,” Vloka added. “And I’ve never beaten her before. This was a ten year long fight.”
A win as epic as this doesn’t come easily, especially with so many talented fencers competing in the opening rounds. Vloka started off the two-day tournament slowly, losing three matchups and finishing the fourth round ranked fifth.
“My first day I didn’t do very well,” Vloka said. “I dropped three bouts, and, going into the second day, I knew I could only give myself one loss.”
This loss, as Vloka predicted, came against one of the sabre tournament’s third place finishers, St. John’s junior Dagmara Wozniak. But, despite these minor setbacks in the early parts of the competition, everything fell into place for Vloka, who was able to finish strong and win the bouts she needed to on the way to the national title. In the semifinals, she defeated Ohio State sophomore Margarita Tschomakova by a score of 15-10 and then went on to beat Ward by a slim two-point margin in the championship round.
“Caroline’s individual successes really help the team improve and succeed as a whole,” Staller said. “People look at her and they recognize the hard work she puts into the fencing, her [attitude] at practice and her mental preparation, and the confidence she exudes on the strip. I learn from that and I think everyone else on the team learns from that.”
Because the tournament schedule in itself is very demanding, fencers at this level need to be both physically fit and mentally tough.
“You need a lot of stamina, because we fence 23 bouts in two days,” said sophomore co-captain Noam Mills, the team’s only other first team All-America honoree, who took second place in the individual epee competition. “These bouts are taken into account for the team championship, but they also determine who will advance to the semifinals in the individual tournament… Every bout counts for a lot.”
Vloka proved that she has what it takes, posting an impressive 19 bouts won in two days and claiming the Crimson’s second-ever individual crown—its first since 2005.
“[Caroline] beat an Olympic medalist in the final,” Mills said. “It was very impressive to watch and it was even better because it was on our home turf here at Harvard.”
Part of a dominant sophomore fencing class, Vloka welcomes the next few seasons for the talented Harvard team with one main goal—a team title to match her own.
“The next thing that we have to do is win the national championship as a team,” Vloka said. “So hopefully that’s where [next year’s training] is going to take us.”

With spring break now in the rear-view mirror and second semester kicking into high gear, the Harvard sailing team competed in the busiest weekend so far of its young spring campaign this past Saturday and Sunday. The co-ed squad took part in three regattas and the women’s contingent also hit the waters for one competition.
The co-ed team challenged some of New England’s best programs in two major regattas over the two-day span, finishing with matching fourth place team efforts at the 70th Owen, Mosbacher & Knapp Trophies race at Brown and the 81st Boston Dinghy Club Cup on the Charles River.
“This weekend we were really able to show the depth of our team,” junior skipper Colin Santangelo said.  “While most teams sent all of their best sailors to just one regatta, we split up our top pairs and came away with great finishes at two big competitions.”
The women’s squad, meanwhile, made the short trip to the waters of Bostonian rival Tufts to participate in the 31st Women’s Duplin Trophy team race. Since the squad was one sailor short, the Crimson teamed up with another local foe, Boston University, to take home fifth place in the team standings.
A Harvard co-ed contingent also competed over the weekend at the Dorchester Bay Invitational, as part of the Central Series of races at Boston College, where a Crimson team finished second overall in the team race.
70TH OWEN, MOSBACHER & KNAPP TROPHIES
The top portion of the co-ed squad traveled down to Providence to compete at the 70th Owen, Mosbacher & Knapp Trophies race at Brown University, where Harvard finished a respectable fourth place out of the 16-team field.
Leading the way for the Crimson was A division junior skipper Alan Palmer, who teamed up with junior crew Meghan Wareham, senior crew Michelle Konstadt, and fellow fourth-year crew Winston Yan to finish second in the division after 12 races over two days.
Third-year skippers Teddy Himler and John Stokes split time taking care of the skipper duties in the B division, as junior crew Quincy Bock, freshman crew Ryan Byrne, and Yan each worked four races in the division, where Harvard finished in ninth place.
81ST BOSTON DINGHY CLUB CUP
Another co-ed contingent stayed closer to home to take part in the 81st Boston Dinghy Club Cup on the Charles River, as the Crimson helped host the event and finished in fourth place out of 18 teams.
“Tufts, BU, and Brown, the three teams that beat us, all brought their best sailors,” Santangelo said, “and there were teams from Florida, Michigan, and Maryland there, so our team finish was a great performance for us.”
Sophomore skipper Brendan Kopp led Harvard’s efforts on the river, as he paired up with freshman crew Alma Lafler to win the B division by a wide margin of 22 points over the course of 17 races.
“Brendan did a great job out there,” Santangelo said.  “It was very cold both days and the wind was very shifty, so the conditions were challenging.  Luck played a big part in how the races played out, as you could quickly go from first to last place as winds changed directions.”
Stokes and Konstadt teamed up in the A division and finished seventh, while Santangelo and sophomore crew William White brought home eighth place in the C division.
31ST WOMEN’S DUPLIN TROPHY TEAM RACE
The women’s team competed in the 31st Women’s Duplin Trophy team race over the weekend, where the Crimson were forced to team up with sailors from BU in order to field a complete squad and finish fifth out of six teams.
“It was challenging working through some of the communication with the BU sailors,” sophomore crew Alexandra Jumper said.  “We had no experience sailing with our third skipper, so we just tried to use it as a learning experience for the rest of the season.”
Senior skipper Liz Powers paired up with sophomore crew Marie Appel, while the duo of second-years skipper Emily Lambert and Jumper also competed on the weekend.
“This is our only team race in either the fall or spring seasons,” Jumper said, “so it was nice to take a break from fleet racing and just try to keep our momentum, energy, and optimism going.”
DORCHESTER BAY INVITATIONAL, CENTRAL SERIES TWO
The co-ed squad also sent a group to the Dorchester Bay Invitational at Boston College as part of the Central Series.  Harvard finished second out of nine teams at the local event.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By now, the end of the semester is closing in, and everyone is feeling worn down by the daily grind. It’s safe to say that most students are ready for a break from the rigors of the school year.
What better break could then be devised than a trip home to spend a weekend doing what you love?
For senior Ariel Delgado, this is exactly the break she experienced, as she travelled to her hometown this weekend to compete in the San Diego Crew Classic.
The Radcliffe heavyweight crew team raced its varsity eight and second varsity eight in the regatta, and both teams fought off strong competition to reach their respective final races on Sunday. The varsity eight finished fifth, and Delgado rowed with the second varsity eight to secure a sixth-place finish.
“It was really special [being in San Diego],” Delgado said. “It was really exciting to race in front of my family. They’d never seen me race before.”
According to Black and White assistant coach Cory Bosworth, also special is the unique presence that Delgado has on the team.
“One of the reasons I love coaching is because I get to meet people like Ariel,” Bosworth emphasized. “She’s a positive person, an incredibly hard worker, a loyal and great teammate and a great all-around athlete,” she added.
Good friend and teammate Carolyn Talley also had nothing but glowing praise for Delgado.
“We’ve been in the same boat basically every year,” Talley explained. “She’s a very motivating person to have in your boat. She motivates herself and then goes beyond to motivate other people. She’s a great leader to have on the team,” the junior added.
Interestingly enough, Delgado had no experience with crew prior to coming to Harvard.
“I hadn’t ever heard of it or seen it before I walked on,” she admitted.
In her freshman year, Delgado earned a varsity letter and “Rookie of the Year” honors on the women’s water polo team as starting goalkeeper.
But midway into her sophomore year, on the suggestion of friends from the crew team, Delgado decided to see what Radcliffe was all about.
“I went in and never turned back,” she said.
In her rookie season, Delgado finished in the top boat for her level—a testament to her impressive athleticism and determination.
“It was a really big learning curve,” Delgado said of starting midway into the fall season. “It was also a lot harder than I expected it to be.”
In her junior fall, Delgado studied abroad in South America, but her semester away from the Black and White did not deter her quick pace of improvement. That spring, Delgado’s hard work was rewarded with a seat in the 2V boat.
“It’s pretty remarkable that she got into the 2V her junior spring,” Bosworth noted. “She didn’t even get a whole year of rowing her sophomore year, and she only rowed half of her junior year. It’s fantastic.”
But for Bosworth, her respect for Delgado is based on far more than just Delgado’s quick rise to varsity level. Most impressive to her is Delgado’s attitude and her commitment to the team.
“She’s continued to bring a lot to the table,” Bosworth said. “The thing about Ariel is that she gets along with everyone. She comes across as very friendly and nice, but she still takes racing very seriously. She’s a very intense competitor and she’s not afraid to give direct feedback to her teammates to make sure they’re making all the sacrifices they need to in order to make the race happen.”
Delgado’s unique combination of unwavering leadership, determination, inexhaustible positivity, and commitment to her Radcliffe community has helped her excel off the water as well.
A Mormon, Delgado is closely involved with her church community. She and Talley, who is also Mormon, help out in a variety of ways.
The church, Delgado feels, helps her maintain a sense of calm.
“I think that it brings a balance to everything that I do,” Delgado said. “Crew can be overwhelming sometimes. When you’re part of a different community it brings a different perspective to everything you do.”
Bosworth also pointed out that Delgado, an English concentrator, has made great strides in her academic career.
“She’s a phenomenal writer,” Bosworth enthused. “Her dissertation is an amazing creative writing project.”
Although Delgado will graduate in two short months, she will leave behind a solid model of success for aspiring Radcliffe athletes.
“I have a ton of respect for her,” Bosworth summarizes. “She’s just that kind of kid—she gets somewhere and she steps up. She’s just an awesome person.”

In this four-part series, FlyBy will dish out the details  of each  House’s Brain Break so that you know where to go when those  evening  munchies hit.
Round 4: Currier vs. Pforzheimer vs. Cabot
Evaluation Date: March 3
Currier: B+
Brain Break Begins: 8:45 p.m.
Currier’s brain break left something to be desired. A healthy assortment of vegetables and salad was available, but the staple foods—bagels and varied cereals—were absent. However, the drink machines were operational, and the healthy food offered a nice alternative for health-conscious Harvardians. After the initial rush, there was still an ample supply of food available, though the supply faded by 10 p.m.
Pforzheimer: A-
Brain Break Begins: 9 p.m.
Pfoho was solid. It lacked the vegetables that Currier had, but Pfoho had what Currier was missing. The well-lit area included cheese cubes and had more cereal than Currier but did not have the array of options and special baked goods that other Houses have had. By the time FlyBy arrived at 8:55 p.m. the pie was gone, but all the other food was still there and no one seemed to be in a hurry to cause a shortage.
Cabot: A-
Brain Break Begins: 9 p.m.
What is with the quad and bagels? Cabot lacked this glorious circle of starchy goodness, but fortunately it had nearly everything else, including five brands of cereal and a full complement of coffee. Again, the pie was gone by 9 p.m., but there was plenty of other food. Unfortunately, much like Pfoho, Cabot lacked the variety of healthy vegetable options that Currier had.
Winner of Round 4: Pfoho

The final club scene not diverse enough for you? MIT frats too immature? Maybe it’s time to swagger your sophisticated self to a real club. But before you make the famed 11-minute T ride into Boston, you call up a member of your entourage who’s already on the scene to see if the club’s popping.
But just as you’re about to board your pimp ship to Park Street, you stop mid-step and realize—you don’t have anyone to text. You don’t go to clubs. You don’t even go into Boston. Enter InstantNightlife.com.
Launched in February, the Web site provides real-time updates on eight Boston-area clubs. Kayvan Zainabadi, the founder of InstantNightlife who received his Ph.D. in biology from MIT in 2009, said he’s been frequenting clubs in L.A. and Boston since he was 19.
On a recent night out, he recognized a need for unbiased, up-to-date communication about the status of clubs. So two months ago he started a Web site to provide weekend updates of eight “eclectic” Boston clubs meant to attract an “eclectic” group of 21+ users.
“Who doesn’t want to know how long the line is? Who doesn’t want to know how packed the club is? Who doesn’t want to know what the girl/guy ratio is like? What music is playing right now?” said Zainabadi.
InstantNightlife sends paid employees to each club to ensure “reliable, unbiased, and accurate information,” he said. “It’s kind of like you calling your friend who’s already inside.”
Zainabadi doesn't plan on stopping there. He said that he's working on expanding the text messaging component of their service and, within the next few weeks, even releasing an iPhone app. So if your entourage doesn't pick up, don't worry—you'll always have InstantNightlife to text.

Even amidst the deluge of midterms and papers that are probably on your to-do list right now, we're sure you've heard of the latest controversy regarding ethnic studies and The Harvard Salient. Still, you may be asking, what's going on?
On March 13, Patrick T. Brennan '11, managing editor of The Salient, published a highly controversial article about ethnic studies. In the article, Brennan condemned the new Ethnic Studies secondary field as tangential to a proper undergraduate education. But in the meantime, his rhetoric-heavy article has ignited passionate debate over meals, House e-mail lists, meetings, and just about any other place at Harvard.
Jaissa L. Feliz '12, vice president of Fuerza Latina, lambasted the article, both for its style and its content.
"While we understand that everyone is entitled to their opinion, we and many members of our community were quite offended by the language used in the article." she said. "We thought that the conclusions were reached in a misinformed manner, and that the language was distasteful and inflammatory."
Professors, too, were aware of the article and its controversy.
Caroline Light, director of studies for the Committee on Degrees in Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies, defended WGS, saying that it has become a more prominent part of the University in recent years given that the number of the students enrolled in WGS classes increased from 300 to 625 over the past four years.
Brennan had many opponents, but he said he also had supporters.
"I have received much agreement and encouragement from all sorts of sources, ranging from Salient editors emeriti who have been through similar experiences to a Kenyan student at Tufts," he said.
Just days after the article was published, House e-mail lists and club lists exploded with commentary, both good and bad, concerning Brennan and his controversial statements.
To this, Brennan said, "I think it's an unfortunate comment on the state of Harvard's intellectual life and the overwhelming liberal majority here that they prefer to insult me over various e-mail lists rather than engage with the substance of my argument."
But while he did maintain his argument, Brennan said he admits that some aspects of its delivery could have used refinement.
"I stand by what I wrote, though I will not deny that some of the statements I made were perhaps slightly hyperbolic and unclearly phrased," Brennan said. "I think much attention has been unfortunately focused on two or three temptingly incendiary sentences rather than the main thrust of my article."

“She’s probably late because she’s the Mole.” “You know who would say that? The  Mole.” “That’s some awfully Mole-like behavior!”
Participants of Quincy House’s very own adaptation  of ABC’s “The Mole”—a popular reality game show that made  suspicion second nature—uttered these accusations as part of the game’s second  round this past Sunday.
In the Quincy House iteration, 11 innocent members of the House began the game, working  together to solve group challenges and to defeat their 12th member—the  Mole. The Mole must lay low, deflect suspicion, and work as a double agent to  subvert the group’s success, while being careful not to reveal his or her identity.
Tri D. Chiem ’10, the creator and host of Quincy  Mole, explained that when the players successfully complete a group challenge,  they receive a clue about the Mole’s identity. If a player wins an individual challenge, then they awarded immunity from possible elimination.
After each challenge, a quiz is sent to each of the  players to test their knowledge of the Mole. The player who scores lowest on the  quiz is eliminated from the game.
“It gets pretty competitive,” notes Chiem.  “Especially around quiz time.”
Competitive only begins to describe it. Players  come to the weekly challenges armed with notebooks and keen observation skills.  During those challenges they collect as many details as they can about their  fellow players, especially those they suspect of being the Mole. Any and every  detail is a potential question on the quiz, and a player can’t afford to be inattentive. To find the Mole, they look for the player who is actively  trying to subvert the successful completion of the group challenges.
Despite the empty apologies and backstabbing, the  contestants are clearly having fun with their fellow housemates—and the skillful  Mole is definitely keeping things lively.
“The Mole’s doing a brilliant job,” said Chiem. “I would even say almost  undetected.”
In this group of quick-witted competitors, we’ll see how long that lasts. With  two rounds already completed, two players have been kicked out of the game.  You can follow the game yourself here.

At the stroke of midnight Monday night, a hush fell over Kirkland House. The moon shimmered eerily and the trees quivered. At long last, the pent-up wrath of the Alpha Zombie was unleashed….and trust us, he/she is hungry.
“I’m going through the list of humans right now trying to pick targets,” said the Alpha Zombie in an exclusive, anonymous interview with this FlyBy correspondent. “I want to make everyone in the house afraid. I want the last thing people experience when they go to sleep and the first thing they experience when they wake up to be fear.”
For the next two and a half weeks, about 140 Kirkland residents—including some tutors and many newly placed freshmen—will have to watch their backs and tote around socks, water guns, and blood-red headbands to make sure they stay alive in zombie-ville.
The masterminds of this elaborate house-bonding activity are the three Humans vs. Zombies (HvZ) “Overseers.” They are Michael J. Chance ’10, Jonathan K. Tam ’10, and Winston H. Luo ’12, who were inspired by a Web site which outlines a version of the game.  But the rules for the Kirkland edition have their own spin, they said.
We’ll leave the nuances of the rules to those students who will be spending the upcoming weeks in mortal peril, but here's the gist: the game starts off with one unidentified—and headbandless—Alpha Zombie. He or she started “killing” humans Monday with a two-hand touch, turning Kirklanders into zombies left and right.
Both zombies and humans have to eat to stay in the game: humans eat by obtaining and turning in “supply cards” with their teammates, while zombies, wearing red headbands, have to feed themselves at least every three days by creeping up on unsuspecting humans and executing a flawless kill.
For protection from hungry teammates who have gone over to the dark side, humans can “stun” zombies for an hour with either a water gun, nerf gun, or by pelting them with a sock.
“We’re just trying to make it more interesting, give it a story, give it more character,” Chance said. “We designed it so that a good way for people to survive is to band together and form teams and work with strangers.”
“But of course you have to be careful because they might be zombies in disguise,” Luo added.
But you may be asking, won’t the humans just stay crouched in their rooms or the Kirkland D-hall, both of which are safe zones? Not if the Overseers have anything to do with it.
“We’ll be sending Emergency Broadcasts over our network to announce supply drops for survivors,” Chance explained. “They’ll have to go to an abandoned warehouse—like Mather House—to pick up more supply cards from a man in red, or something along those lines.”
The Overseers also have some tutors lined up to role-play, assuming the personas of scientists or arms dealers.
The Alpha Zombie refused to reveal any of his/her strategies, but left us with these chilling words:
“I’m not a mindless zombie. I kill, but not at random.”
So keep your eyes peeled for some Thriller action around Kirkland Courtyard until April 16, the designated “Rescue Date.” And Kirklanders, beware: the Alpha Zombie is on the prowl.
