After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard, an international hub for intellectual debate … where no one disagrees.
This is the Harvard I have come to know, especially in the classroom. But, apparently, it wasn’t always this way.
A professor of mine recently remarked about how no one argues in section anymore, and asked us why we were so “well-behaved.” During her time at the College in the ’70s, arguing was the norm, she shared.
If being scared to speak up is conflated with being well-behaved then, hell, at least I seem polite.
Even the more liberal students in the class (I’m assuming by their prior comments, and the fact that they go to Harvard) couldn’t deny it. One of my peers remarked that students are probably scared of being canceled, and everyone in the class nodded along.
I chimed in, noting the nebulous “wokeness” that students feel beholden to. Especially in humanities courses, I often soften or withhold my contributions to class, worrying that they are not up to the woke standard of the day.
These standards fluctuate every day. No one can keep up with what’s “okay” to say.
In one class, a student scoffed in disbelief at criticism of the most recent stimulus bill, incredulous that it could be questioned in any way. The stimulus? Really? One of the most monumental spending bills of the decade should be able to be questioned and thoughtfully debated in an academic setting. But the Harvard standard is that, at least for now, it’s hands off the stimulus bill, no questions.
Herein lies the problem: There are topics, mostly around capitalism, race, identity, and free speech that students simply refuse to debate anymore — my peers think they don’t need to be argued. We can all be “well-behaved” because the woke standard is set, often sealed with the “lived experience” trump card. If you want to debate it, you are part of the problem.
Often we walk into sections wondering what the teaching fellows’ (and our peers’) threshold of wokeness is. It’s a guessing game. For instance, it would be risky to argue against defunding the police in the classroom (let alone outside of it). The implicit fear is that you’d present as someone who doesn’t care about racism, even if you deplore it. So you just wouldn’t argue.
It’s easier to be quiet than misconstrued.
These implicit understandings are the reason that argument culture is dead at Harvard. They are the reason that I preface all of my opinions in class with: “A theory I’ve heard is …”, “Hypothetically, what if …”, “Yeah I agree with that but I could see someone saying …”, “I’m not sure if this is reasonable but I’ve read that …”
In fact, most of my peers nod along as I talk about the ambiguity of wokeness and the fear of saying the wrong thing. It’s something that I believe most Havard students see as a problem.
Yet we continue to conform — and, perhaps, rightly so. The social cost is too great.
Students are reasonable to fear the repercussions of what they say in class. Take The Crimson Editorial Board’s staff-ed from last September: When the Harvard Law School adopted a non-attribution policy for its students online, the Board, of which I am a member, was concerned that the policy would allow students to “eschew accountability for their speech” — an unfounded concern.
“Harvard Law students are on the brink of holding enormous power in our society — they must know that they are responsible for their words,” it reads.
Well, kind of. Students should be held accountable for what they say. However, the problem is that Harvard has created a culture where acceptable conduct is an ever-moving target and there is little forgiveness when you miss the mark. If we truly want students who will have “enormous power” to be responsible leaders, they should feel comfortable expressing their opinions in an academic setting so that they may be corrected and refined when appropriate. Harvard’s culture of fear makes it so that students remain silent when they could be engaging in enormously meaningful conversations: conversations that could correct ignorances and future missteps.
More importantly, if we don’t have the chance to slip up in the classroom or ask the tough questions, how do we become thoughtful future leaders primed for real-world dilemmas? We have created an educational environment that only caters to a fictitious woke utopia.
So what’s the answer? We all know it’s a problem.
The simple, but difficult solution is to speak up with certainty and not to shy away from sharing our views. The more that we engage in those taboo conversations, the more we will inspire those around us to do the same. Remember, most students probably feel the same pressure to stay silent, and most probably find it unreasonable.
Of course, this is not also a free pass to spew hateful beliefs. But I would like to assume that most of my classmates have good intentions. Even if some of their opinions are flawed, I’d like to discuss them anyway: to understand them, learn from them, and most importantly, argue against them.
So argue. Replace the “Hypothetically, what if ...” with “I believe that …” or, even better, “That’s wrong, and here’s why.”
Argue respectfully, argue truthfully, and most importantly, argue with an open mind.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s often thrown around — whether it be by well-meaning college admissions counselors or by students ditching their problem sets for parties on Friday nights — that you don’t go to Harvard just to study. Many enroll at the College seeking to make connections, to establish worthwhile contacts, and to rub shoulders with “the best and the brightest,” whomever they may be. Perhaps even more than the classes, a large draw of Harvard is the social network.
If Harvard seems like a networking opportunity first and an academic institution second for us now, we only have to look to the Harvard of the past to see the situation magnified tenfold. Citing a recent working paper in the National Bureau of Economic Research, journalist Jordan Weissmann characterizes the mid-to-late 20th century Harvard as “a glorified networking club for wealthy prep schoolers.” The paper itself investigates the intricate dynamic through which exclusive student clubs, especially final clubs, at Harvard shaped upward mobility; ultimately, it exposes that these organizations elevated students who were already wealthy and well-positioned, while failing to extend the same benefits to those of less advantaged backgrounds.
On the one hand, it’s uplifting to see real research being conducted on the involved and complex interplay between Harvard’s people and institutions. Harvard is so often depicted as a mysterious, almost magical place; this research helps to grapple with that narrative — to interrogate false notions, to help demystify the University, and to excavate the “ivory tower” of prestigious universities more generally.
Still, we also must acknowledge that — against the backdrop of Harvard's current social atmosphere — the paper’s depiction of Harvard’s past is not at all surprising to us.
Aggressive networking culture and socioeconomic stratification are very much alive and present at Harvard today. We all know students who are proud to chase connections first and comfort second; we all know fervent social climbers — those who are shamelessly dedicated to locking in early friendships with soon-to-be CEOs, future public office-holders, and potential trailblazers within Fortune 500 companies. We are also all aware of the disparities between the most and least privileged students at Harvard. We know about the social capital created by flaunting wealth; and conversely, we know about the wearying hurdles — from the social to the academic to the personal — that low-income students are continually forced to overcome.
To that end, this working paper simply grants theoretical meaning to experiential truths, providing Harvard’s most basic, time-tested realities clarity and confirmation.
Beyond that, the authors’ depiction of the exclusive and ostentatious nature of Harvard’s final clubs underscores the well-understood but oft-unspoken truth that privilege begets privilege — at Harvard and beyond. Indeed, on Harvard’s grounds, old friends from prestigious private high schools are seamlessly absorbed into the network, with established final club members sliding letters under the doors of well-connected freshmen. But the connections don’t end there; instead, as the NBER paper highlights, final clubs have historically served to line their members up with jobs in well-respected and high-paying companies. Such realities offer proof of the speculation that the networks final clubs bestow upon their members exist in a different stratosphere than that of the regular Harvard network. Troublingly, they also offer a testament to the mode through which the elite so often serve to exclusively fortify and uplift their own.
These realities become even more perturbing when compounded with the fundamental truth that Harvard students from non-privileged backgrounds struggle to access the basic advantages enjoyed by those groomed for elite status at Harvard. Even the word “networking” — whose inviting connotations imply that any individual can make new connections and thrive — is unintuitive for students who did not grow up in communities where networking is a well-established concept. From the outset, Harvard isn’t experienced equally, a reality cemented even before we all arrive here together.
Still, Harvard markets itself as an instrument of social mobility: a ladder that propels students to higher status post-college lives. To move forward productively, we must begin to interrogate such falsities; to be honest about how stratifications of wealth and class affect students’ capacity to wield the Harvard experience as a tool for social ascension; and to ultimately explore the modes through which we can level the playing field at Harvard.
Such explorations are by no means simple. Many of the University's related efforts, including past attempts to sanction exclusive social clubs, have plainly failed in the past. We must carefully probe the disparities experienced by students of diverse backgrounds, thoughtfully reckon with the inequities that continue to pervade our campus, and tirelessly seek new and creative ways to bridge the gaps between students with varying gradations of privilege.
Finally, we also find ourselves deeply concerned by the single measure of success — a high-paying career and a place among the elite of the elite — sold by exclusive final clubs and in some ways, bought into by this study. As a board, we disagree with the notion that a Harvard education must be geared towards the final goal of accumulating money and power.
Harvard was an old boys’ club in the 20th century, and this truth prevails today. Viewing our university as a subject of research rather than the institution producing research, for a change, may be the first step in making this club less exclusive.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Engulfed in what Martin Luther King Jr. described as “the fierce urgency of now”, the year 2020 lived up to its numerical metaphor — providing unprecedentedly clear insights into the enormity of the issues bequeathed by the previous generation for today’s young generations to solve. And indeed, around the world in 2021, positive youth of all ages are responding “Si se puede!” to the challenge of creating a more just, equitable, and environmentally sustainable world.
A fast-growing group of young graduates organized only 14 months ago, Harvard Forward, has already achieved landmark success in galvanizing support for greater representation of committed young alumni in the highest governing body of their university. Their central goal is more inclusive governance that will increase university action to find solutions to racial and social injustice as well as the increasingly critical issue of climate change now facing young people everywhere.
Last August, with an emphasis on the need for the University to divest itself of its investments in fossil fuels and increase sustainability research and education, Harvard Forward-endorsed candidates, with enthusiastic alumni support, won three of the five open seats on the University’s Board of Overseers.
For this class of ’61 student of history, whose years now almost quadruple the age of the most recent Harvard alums, the call of Harvard Forward is not unprecedented. The goal of achieving a socially-progressive Board of Overseers evokes the long history of courageous Harvard students and graduates of the past who were committed to addressing and solving the urgent issues of their times that threatened the survival and advancement of the highest potential of humankind.
Many alumni can remember the courageous anti-apartheid movement and insurgent Board of Overseers campaign in the 1980s summoning the support of ethical giants like Archbishop Desmond Tutu. But that tradition stretches far further back into Harvard’s history, perhaps epitomized by a galaxy of courageous 19th century alumni — both famous and forgotten. Their commitment to creating a more just human society helped achieve historic advances towards that goal
Perhaps most similar to the current issues of Harvard’s own ethical and social advancement is the example of Harvard students, faculty, alumni, and administrators in the autumn of 1921 challenging the growing university policy of housing segregation. Sparked by the initial challenge to that racial injustice by African and Native American student Edwin B. Jourdain, Jr. ’21 (my father), their cause attracted the support of Harvard luminaries including elite Board of Overseers member and President of the NAACP Moorfield Storey and Black civil rights icon W.E.B. Du Bois.
They published articles in the press and created petitions and polls that gathered signatures from alumni nationwide. Though undoubtedly highly varied in their 1920s personal values, Harvard students and alumni united to hold Harvard to its highest ideals and set the University on a more accurate path towards a brighter human future. In April 1923, after sustained alumni pressure, the Board of Overseers voted unanimously to overturn the policy of excluding Black students from the freshman dorms.
That inspiring response of Harvard students, alumni, faculty, and governance members nearly a century ago revealed that Harvardians of all ages would put aside their personal predilections and vote strongly for the University to end its budding policy of banning incoming Black students from the lavishly constructed freshman dormitories. Those dormitories, specifically designed to create long-lasting student bonds, are now one of the richest and most multicultural aspects of the Harvard experience.
Today, exactly 100 years from the spark of that remarkable event, the Harvard Board of Overseers’ 2021 election offers the opportunity for us to continue this history. Thanks to the remarkably impressive slate of Harvard Forward-endorsed candidates who represent a much-needed increase in ethnic, racial, and gender diversity, and whose individual perspectives promise much-needed focus for positive action on today’s major urgent issues: the urgent slowdown of devastating climate change and equally needed increased economic equality and social justice for long excluded and marginalized people.
To this aging Class of ‘’61 alumnus and student of history then, today’s epic, and sadly largely man-made, global crises are perhaps still most powerfully stated in the immortal and stunningly prescient words of President Abraham Lincoln in his address to Congress in December 1862:
“The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise — with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew … We — even we here — hold the power, and bear the responsibility”

The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard announced Thursday the launch of the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center, which will aim to promote human health by integrating machine learning and the life sciences.
Funded by a $150 million endowment gift from former Google CEO Eric E. Schmidt and his wife, businesswoman Wendy Schmidt, the Schmidt Center will bring together academic and industrial professionals from around the world to conduct interdisciplinary research in data science and biology.
The Schmidts’ gift will coincide with an additional $150 million contribution from the Broad Foundation to the Broad Institute’s general endowment. Eric Schmidt, who left Google in 2020 after 19 years and has an estimated net worth of roughly $19 billion, serves on the Broad Institute’s board of directors.
The center will collaborate with researchers from MIT, Harvard, and the Harvard teaching hospitals, in addtion to global companies, including Google Research and Microsoft.
“It’s a transformational moment for both medicine and biology,” said Anthony A. Philippakis, co-director of the newly formed center.
Caroline Uhler, professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT and fellow co-director of the new center, said the Schmidt Center’s creation is inspired by recent revolutions in data science and biology: the growth of data technologies like cloud computing and machine learning, and advances in genome sequencing.
Philippakis said he hopes efforts at the Schmidt Center will promote the transfer of ideas between biology and machine learning — particularly in the less-developed pipeline from life sciences to machine learning.
“The real success of the new center will be marked not by bringing ideas of machine learning into biology — that’s very much already happening and will happen with or without the Schmidt Center — but if we can see that the life sciences actually drives research in machine learning,” he said.
Puneet Batra ’98, who leads the Machine Learning for Health group at the Broad Institute, said the Schmidt Center’s founding comes at an “exceptional moment” for both biology and machine learning.
“What we’re already seeing is that this is attracting not just a lot of attention from machine learning people who usually might not think about biology, but it’s also attracting a lot of attention from the folks at, say, Longwood and Harvard Medical School,” Batra said. “They’re excited about the possibility of machine learning transforming their own fields, and so everybody is just now starting to take a look and define what problems could really be tackled.”
According to Uhler, the Broad Institute is “uniquely fertile ground” for the interdisciplinary collaboration the Schmidt Center aims to promote because it already has a strongly-connected network of biologists, biotechnologists, and computational scientists.
Aviv Regev — head of Genentech research and early development and former Chair of the Faculty and first recruited core member at the Broad Institute — wrote in an emailed statement that the Broad powers new advances by bridging academia and industry.
“During my time at the Broad, I helped to lay the foundation for the Schmidt Center,” she wrote. “I’m now at Genentech, and we look forward to collaborating with the Schmidt Center on research at the interface of the life sciences and computer science, including activities such as talent exchanges via internship programs and participation in public scientific seminars.”
The Schmidt Center will collaborate with researchers at Mayo Clinic, Geisinger Health System, AstraZeneca, Novartis, Google Research, and Microsoft, among numerous others. Establishing connections between the new center and industry is integral for the development of key health interventions, per Philippakis.
“We really don’t want this to be just about papers in journals, but actually see the ideas and insights turned into things that are new therapies or better ways of caring for patients,” Philippakis said. “And that impact often requires interactions with industry.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Graduate School of Education is “prioritizing” reopening its campus in the fall and plans to resume accepting applications to its doctoral program, HGSE Dean Bridget Terry Long said in an interview Monday.
Long said HGSE is dedicated to holding in-person instruction in the fall, though the school has not yet set an official date for the campus reopening.
“What you will probably see is a balance of some of our courses online, some of our courses face-to-face,” Long said. “What that relative balance looks like is going to depend a lot on if there are restrictions on issues of public health.”
“I can’t make guarantees — again, based on public health — that it will be absolutely September 1, but that’s what we’re moving towards,” she said regarding the reopening date.
The school will continue to offer online classes because it enrolled a cohort of part-time students last summer, many of whom work full-time and would not be able to travel to campus when it reopens, Long said.
“We are also carrying with us part-time students who started this year who are going to finish online next year, so we’re also going to have a robust online community while we are still focused on being back on campus,” Long said.
Long also said she believes those students benefited from the opportunity to enroll in HGSE without ever setting foot on Harvard's campus.
“It is certainly the case that for our mid-career, older students who are job-embedded, this online remote teaching is working very well for them. It allows them to apply what they’re learning in the classroom immediately to problems of practice that they’re seeing in the field,” she said.
HGSE's relationship with mid-career students has been a symbiotic one, Long added.
After identifying benefits that the remote, part-time cohort brought to HGSE, Long said the administration is examining the possibility of continuing to admit part-time students to a separate online degree program. Last year’s summer admissions cycle will be a one-time occurrence, though.
“We’re investigating now whether or not we will continue to have an online degree, but we’re not planning on having a summer admissions process,” Long said.
On the other hand, Long announced that doctoral program admissions would resume after a one-year hiatus.
“The admissions pause was only for one year. It was helpful to really be able to focus on supporting our current doctoral students both in the Ph.D. and Ed.L.D., but we’re on target and excited about reopening admissions this year,” Long said.
The decision to pause admissions occurred as a result of both financial strain and limited faculty capacity, according to Long.
“It was partly concerned about finances, but an even greater concern was about the need to support our current students,” she said, adding that the school wanted to ensure its faculty had the capacity to deliver a “high-quality, highly supportive program” to current students.
During the interview, Long also addressed the newly redesigned Master’s program at HGSE — announced in February — which emphasizes teaching students foundational knowledge before more specialized training.
With the change, HGSE has now redesigned each of its main degree tracks during the last decade. Because the Master’s program is the school’s largest, Long said the recent structural change has the potential to redefine the way education is taught.
“Typically, what happens in higher education, and any college or university, is we organize ourselves around our disciplines,” Long explained. “We flipped it on its head and said, ‘Well, no. How does the field organize itself?’ And we’ve put together our programs, really matching how educators proceed through their careers.”
That latest effort is expected to be the last large shift at the institution for the time being, as HGSE redesigned its Ed.L.D. and Ph.D. programs several years ago, Long said.
With these changes in place and the current academic year coming to a close, Long reflected on the difficulties the Covid-19 pandemic has posed.
“In the early weeks, we just had no idea what was going to happen. I remember when we thought this was only going to be two weeks,” she said.
“It’s been incredibly difficult, and it’s been incredibly frustrating as Dean that I can’t make everything better — that we’re all going to walk away from this with some scars,” she added.

Harvard researchers have identified a mutation in several common Covid-19 variants that causes a structural change in the virus, allowing it to spread more rapidly, according to a study published earlier this month in the journal Science.
The study, which was published on March 16, was conducted by researchers at Boston Children’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School, and Codex BioSolutions, a Maryland-based biotech company.
The researchers focused on the D614G mutation, which mutates exactly one amino acid, or building block, of spike proteins found on the surface of coronavirus variants. These spike proteins are known to be the key mechanism allowing the virus to bind to cells and cause infection.
Bing Chen, the senior author of the paper and a researcher at Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, led a study in July 2020 showing that the spike proteins present on the original strain of Covid-19 were unstable, causing them to dissociate before infecting a cell.
When the coronavirus variants were first identified and reported, researchers hypothesized that the increased infectiousness resulted from an increase in the virus’ binding affinity with the cell receptor. A subsequent study, however, found that the binding affinity of the variant viruses in fact decreased after the mutation.
That mystery, which Chen called “puzzling,” led the Harvard researchers to investigate potential structural differences between the variants and the original virus.
Chen said their study is novel due to its focus on a small feature of the virus.
“Typically, let’s say for a structural biologist, you probably wouldn’t do that because there’s a single residue change. This is a single residue out of 1,273 residues,” Chen said. “Yet, all these observations suggest a large structural difference between these new variants and the original virus.”
Jun Zhang, a research fellow in pediatrics at Boston Children’s Hospital and a member of the research team, said a loop on the variant’s spike proteins increases the virus’s stability, making infection more likely.
Chen’s research lab initially focused on HIV, but when the pandemic started, he and his team switched their focus to the coronavirus. Zhang said his team “wanted to help” Covid-19 research by applying its understanding of HIV, which has a similar spike protein to that of the coronavirus.
Chen said his team's research could have significant implications for the development of future Covid-19 vaccines.
“All these existing vaccines started very early, at an early stage of the pandemic. No one had a choice to pick, so everyone started with the original sequences,” Chen said. “Ideally, what you want would be to combine [the new variants’] changes with this particular variant’s change together to generate the next generation vaccines.”
Chen said current immunity to the coronavirus — whether by vaccination or natural infection — will likely not extend to future variants.
“How resistant they are going to be is always hard to predict,” Chen said. “In the end, you just have to keep incorporating all the changes to fight against these new variants.”

Harvard must disclose documents and other materials related to student suicides as part of pre-trial procedures in a 2018 wrongful death lawsuit, the Middlesex County Superior Court ruled last week.
The suit alleges that Harvard and some of its employees were negligent in their care of Harvard undergraduate Luke Z. Tang ’18, who died by suicide on campus in September 2015.
The student’s father, Wendell W. Tang, filed the suit in September 2018 against the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — as well as resident dean Catherine R. Shapiro, Lowell House resident dean Caitlin Casey, Harvard University Health Services mental health counselor Melanie G. Northrop, and HUHS psychiatrist David W. Abramson.
The court denied Harvard’s motion to dismiss the case in September 2019. Last year, the defendants and plaintiff filed dueling motions over whether certain University documents and materials would be subject to discovery in the lawsuit.
In last week’s ruling, dated March 22, Justice of the Superior Court Valerie A. Yarashus ordered Harvard to produce documents and data on student suicides, among other evidence.
Yarashus wrote in the order that juries in negligence cases typically consider “the likelihood and severity of the potential harm in determining whether a defendant used reasonable care.” She added that the jury for this case “will need to assess the foreseeability of Luke Tang’s suicide.”
“These factors bring many of Tang’s discovery requests, including the requests for admissions concerning statistics and incidence of suicide, within the relevance boundaries of the claims being asserted,” Yarashus wrote in the ruling. “It would be patently unfair to instruct a jury to consider these factors while denying the plaintiff the right to seek discovery on those topics.”
The court ordered Harvard to produce campus police reports “related to Harvard student suicides” and statistics on student suicides dating from Jan. 1, 2005 to the present day — including the initials, year in school, and location of death of each Harvard student who died by suicide.
“Since reasonable care is affected by a defendant’s knowledge of risk, the plaintiff is entitled to discovery for a broader period of time than simply the time that Luke Tang was a student, with respect to Harvard’s protocols, policies, and procedures,” the order reads. “Other trial judges who have ruled on similar cases have found that ten years prior to a student suicide is a reasonable period of time to look back on similar cases.”
Still, the court requested information on other suicide cases brought against Harvard since Jan. 1, 2000, if they exist. The order states that this longer time frame “accounts for the fact that it is anticipated there will be far fewer court cases against Harvard than there were student suicides” and the increased likelihood of unearthing “more relevant information contained in similar court cases.”
The court also ruled that evidence on “the efficacy of Harvard’s response to the risk of student death” from Jan. 1, 2005 to present — including the number of students who were treated by Harvard’s Counseling and Mental Health Services and “expressed suicidal ideation” during therapy, were treated for suicide threats or attempts, or died by suicide — must be provided “if and only if Harvard has already compiled this information.”
Harvard is not required to produce the confidential mental health records of students other than Luke Tang, the order states.
The ruling ordered Harvard to produce all emails that mention Luke Tang sent by or to the defendants prior to and after his death and all emails sent to or from his email address if it has not already done so. The court sustained Harvard’s objection, however, to a motion requesting all emails that mention Luke Tang sent by or to any “agents, servants and/or employees” of the University.
The order additionally requested Harvard to turn over all emails and other correspondence that concerned Luke Tang’s “risk of suicide” between University employees and mental health professionals who treated him.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on the lawsuit.

Updated: March 30, 2021 at 2:58 p.m.
Eight teams across three categories — student business, social enterprise, and alumni — were awarded a total of $325,000 in prize money Tuesday through Harvard Business School’s annual New Venture Competition.
Established in 1997, the New Venture Competition draws a competitive pool of alumni and graduate students at Harvard and around the country to compete for funding for their startup ventures.
In this year’s competition, more than 300 teams competed and were judged by more than 150 judges, who ranged from lawyers to social entrepreneurs.
During the finale, 12 finalist teams presented 90-second pitches to the audience, vying for one of three prizes awarded in each category: grand prize, runner up, and crowd favorite. Ultimately, eight teams were chosen for those prizes across the student business, social enterprise, and alumni categories.
Robert B. Lane, a first-place winner in the student business track and a second-year MBA student, said he was in “absolute disbelief” when he learned his team was named a grand prize winner for their venture, Concord Materials, which digitizes workflow for ordering bulk construction materials.
“We have real plans to deploy this technology quickly to really help people, and this will give us a significant amount of runway to deploy faster to implement our vision,” Lane said. “It really, really makes a tremendous difference at this stage of our lifecycle and for the type of value we can create for our customers.”
Other winning teams discussed how the funding will enable their ventures to reach a wider audience.
First-year MBA and MPA/ID student Camille T. Ang — whose team won the grand prize in the student business track alongside Concord Materials – said she and her co-founder Jiawen Tang, second-year MPA/ID student, will use the funding to launch a full pilot of their digital healthcare insurance accessibility venture, Hive Health, in the Philippines and Southeast Asia over the summer.
“Having NVC not just validate us but to help us in our journey to think about the critical issues and help us reach out to an audience of people interested in this space as well — and then we get inbound inquiries of people who are also solving similar problems — that's encouraging,” Ang said.
Second-year MBA student Shelly S. Xu, whose team won the crowd favorite and grand prize in the social enterprise category, said she plans on using the prize money to hire some of her team members and invest in technology for her sartorial sustainability venture, Shelly Xu Design.
“We have some amazing talent on our team, and I really want some of them to become full-time. So, probably the funding will go toward that,” Xu said. “Also, we’re working on this proprietary algorithm that allows us to scale zero-waste designs, and so they can be applied to other styles out there right now.”
“And then lastly, I think investing more in our manufacturing hardware, so that we can actually produce zero-waste designs better,” she added.
Second-year MBA student William H. “Hunter” Goble, whose team won the Tough Technology Prize for “breakthrough science, engineering, and leadership,” said he was excited and grateful for the “opportunity to continue telling our story” and for “exposure.”
“I was ecstatic. I think it just was encouraging that someone heard our story and what we were trying to do and found it compelling enough to advance us to the final round of a competitive competition like this,” Goble said.
Some finalists said they valued the team and skill-building aspects of the competition as well as the judges’ feedback.
“We’ve made friends with some of the other teams and kind of worked together to determine how we can strengthen our value propositions and our stories,” first-year MBA student Ilana R. Springer said. “We’ve kind of built this community of entrepreneurs who were also involved in the New Venture Competition process.”
First-year MBA student Sylvan Guo said she valued the “transparent feedback” offered throughout the competition.
“We’ve done other pitch competitions, and at the end, it’s like, ‘Oh, we have six finalists teams and then we’ll choose one,’ but with NVC you get to see every single judge, what they rated you, and why they rated you,” she explained. “So you know that in your next iteration, then, you can improve on X, Y, and Z.”
Omolara O. Fatiregun ’00, a doctor of education leadership candidate at the Graduate School of Education, said she appreciated the platform the competition provides aspiring entrepreneurs.
“Harvard is a massive platform, and just being on this stage alongside other ventures has just been a really phenomenal experience,” Fatiregun said. “The visibility, the access to investors, mentors, and other social entrepreneurs in this space is phenomenal.”
Fatiregun added that the competition made her feel pride for her background and reaffirmed her commitment to expanding access to educational resources.
“It’s not lost on me that I’m a Black woman, I’m the child of immigrants, and so many people who look like me or who have my family story — whether they’re Black people, brown people, or new Americans — don’t get to go to Harvard,” Fatiregun said. “I am particularly proud for all of the identities that I have and the communities that I represent. I want to bust the door open and just improve access to these amazing opportunities so everyone can thrive.”

Do you have back to back Zoom classes? Do you find yourself barely having time between your classes to make a meal? Are your meals constantly looking like this?:
Then you’ve come to the right place. While balancing a college schedule can be difficult, there is no reason to skip meals. We at Flyby have compiled our go-to list of quick and easy meals you can make to power you through a day on Zoom!
Sandwich
Ah, the classic and reliable option. Get your two pieces of bread (white, whole wheat, whatever. But we recommend a nice sourdough to really elevate your experience), some sort of spread, protein, and veggies for the health factor. Slap them together and boom, lunch is done. Sandwiches get bonus points because you can easily chow down on them during your boring Zoom lectures!
Pasta 
Carbs carbs carbs. Pasta is relatively easy and painless to make. Get yourself whatever pasta shape you prefer (rotini is a favorite at Flyby) and boil until al dente. Then, get some sort of pasta sauce and dump that on. For extra nutrition, toss in spinach or an alternative source of protein. Disclaimer: this recipe might not be Italian-approved, but it’s still pretty darn tasty.
Frozen Meals
Yes, unfortunately, as busy college students, we do have to resort to eating frozen meals. BUT, Trader Joe’s frozen meals almost never disappoint and can be relatively healthy! We love the Trader Joe’s Gyoza — the fillings range from chicken to salmon to pork to shrimp to veggies. The easiest way to make them is to throw them in a pan with some oil and in a few minutes, you’ll have a delicious lunch! Pair with sriracha for extra flavor.
Oatmeal
Not only is oatmeal nutritious and filling, it can also be made in a microwave in less than 5 minutes! You can customize it and add whatever toppings your heart desires. We recommend banana slices, peanut butter, and dark chocolate. If you’re extra like we are, you can make it ~aesthetic~. Mmmmm.
Hopefully, these quick meals will give you inspiration for your next lunch and prevent you from starving between your Zoom lectures! Give them a try and let us know how they taste.

April 1st, the day to commemorate the wisdom and comedic prowess of humanity, is upon us. Whether you unknowingly wake up to your toilet freshly Saran wrapped or experience random strangers kicking you out of the blue, it’s bound to be an adventurous day! And while we might all be watching our backs for our roommate’s next practical joke, why not cozy up against a nice wall or some other protective surface and discover who/what is even more foolish than you — not just today but every day of the year.
1. Wellness Days (A Fool’s Paradise)
We didn’t ask for them, but here they are, and they’re almost as sus as the pat on the back your best friend gave you this morning. It could be any random day of the week and SURPRISE, no class. Time to completely bask in physical and mental wellness. Unfortunately, I have three psets, two essays, six exams, and a decathlon to win tomorrow, our next wellness day. I suppose I’ll settle for being well when I retire, or when the semester ends, whichever comes first.
P.S. That’s why you’re being kicked by randos in the Square. The sign on your back (yes it's there) says kick me ;)
2. Unnecessarily Pretentious Harvard Lingo (What Fools these Mortals be) 
From tutors and teaching fellows to concentrations and citations, Harvard lingo has its students looking like elitist fools to normal non-Harvard folks. It’s almost a practical joke every time we describe our ~transformative Harvard experience~ to family and friends. If only the world could understand what I mean when I explain that my proctor busted a gathering in the entryway upstairs right before Housing Day, and the whole blocking group might be Ad-Boarded. Foolish.
3. The Lampoon (There’s No Fool like an Old Fool)
Not much needs to be said here. The Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine, tends to speak foolishly enough by itself. Until they stop with their juvenile antics (*cough cough* making a Twitter account for a chair), they will forever be the oldest fool at Harvard. Let’s be honest, even that likely could not save them from themselves.
4. Imposter Syndrome (A Fool’s Errand)
As one of the most understated and untalked about tragedies at Harvard, the infamous imposter syndrome has a fool to make of us all. Even though some internal demon periodically tries to convince you that Harvard is too good for you, it’s false because some important and smart people at 86 Brattle Street said so. Don’t question it. YOU’RE too GOOD for THAT. You 100% should be at Harvard even when you feel like a big fool :)
5. Midterms That Aren’t Mid-Term (Played for a Fool)
To all the brilliant STEM kids at Harvard, this one’s especially for you. Whether it’s in Chem 27, Math 21a, or LS1b, the concept of one midterm is merely the shadow of a dream you’ve never had because it’s so unrealistic. It’s not that the syllabus didn’t warn you there’d be multiple exams, but it’s not like your ideal med school cares about your suffering, either.
Any STEM Professor ever: “Let’s call them midterms, but make like ten of them in one term! Time to play those fools like Tom Brady played the Bucs!”
6. Yale (I Pity the Fool) 
How could Yale — an institution based predominantly on Harvard’s own foolishness — possibly escape its fate as our pitied fool? We saved the best for last to ensure this huge fool couldn’t be you, a less foolish Harvard student. Was Yale founded on April 1st? Because that’d be the best April Fools’ joke in the history of the Ivy League. No, it’d be the most wondrous joke in the history of college as a concept.  
7. HAPPY APRIL FOOLS (There is a Foolish Corner in the Mind of the Wisest Man) 
There are only seven. GOTCHA!
Wishing you all a beautifully chaotic April Fools’ Day. Good luck and remember to check the toilet!
