After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Netflix’s “The Standups” features six comics, ranging from thoroughly mediocre to occasionally exceptional, performing straightforward 30-minute sets. The latter category—the occasionally exceptional—encompasses Nate Bargatze and Dan Soder. The former category features Fortune Feimster (whose special tries to ruin callback jokes for all comics) and Beth Stelling. Nikki Glaser’s 29-minute set is far below her considerable talents. They are not all worth your time. But, kind reader, I have been told that negativity is not a characteristic that the critic should embody.
Instead of writing about those pieces of comedy that I feel ambivalently impassioned about, I should admit that I am oddly infatuated by Deon Cole’s half hour. I do not believe that Cole has transcendent material; he is upfront with the structure of his special: “What I’m going to do tonight is, I’m going to try out some jokes. Hopefully they’ll work. If they don’t then I’ll never see y’all again so it don’t matter.” He sticks to his word.
His jokes are not linked by any specific sense of long-form structure. He’s not a storyteller in the strictest sense of the phrase. He’s barely a joke teller. Half of his bits are sharply formed scenes without a punchline (and more interestingly, without Cole as a participant). Some of them are just thoughts that could have been amusing at one point (I do mean that in the best way possible—remember, I harbor no negativity).
Some of them work. Some of them don’t. At his best, Cole is birthing gems like this into existence, “If you’re over thirty make some noise. [Disparate cheering.] Remember when you were the future,” and this, “[Cole searches through his joke notebook.] Usually when a comedian leaves, they leave on a real big joke at the end. I can’t find that joke. So I’m just going to go. Bye.” (Cole’s jokes lose considerable weight when written—I will discuss this momentarily.)
However, even these gems are untethered to some distinct sense of structure. It is as if Cole is unburdened by the responsibility to make comedy that fits to the normalized beats of “good” modern comedy: cohesive themes, probably an implied sentiment about what it means to be human, and a climactic concluding joke.
With that said, Cole is crafting a character in the crevices between the loosely held joke structure of his special. Most of Cole’s jokes do not feature him as an explicit protagonist (or even an implicit participant)—perhaps because Cole’s work is subtler than other comics’. The character that Cole creates is not formed out of the web of personal experiences that have crafted Cole into the individual he is in the reality of life off of the stage. The character that Cole creates is animated in the “now,” as he terms it, of the show. One comes to understand who Cole is though the jokes he tells and the loose associations between his bits.
The subtleties of creation are what, consciously or unconsciously, define the special in its most brilliant moments. When Cole raspily queries, “You ever be out in public with your husband, wife, boyfriend, or girlfriend and you see someone who’s fine, sexy, and hot to death? You ever thought to yourself, ‘I should have been patient.’ [Subdued laughter.] I see a lot of y’all can’t really laugh at that joke the way you want to,” he is not the subject of the joke. He is not explicitly the observer of the joke. Even the evocation of “husband, wife, boyfriend, girlfriend,” places Cole in the position of representing multiple perspectives (in other words, “we” is the proper pronoun for this joke, instead of “I”). However, the structure of “Have you ever” places him as the implied thinker.
Thus, Cole is straddling the divide between the comic as a personalized individual and the comic as a kind of omniscient observer of amusing anecdotes. He is straddling the divide between “I” and “we.”
The marks of this sort of transient perspective are subtly littered all over the special. Cole shifts his eyes over the crowd during pauses—as if he is evaluating you while you evaluate him. On his creased joke list, he ticks off which bits work and which bits don’t. In short, he fashions himself as both the artist and the audience, the perceiver and the perceived: the critic.
I, dear reader, believe that this issue of perspective is fascinating material. Perhaps you think that this is intellectual posturing, so allow me to hastily shift gears to discuss the most salient point of the special—Cole’s cool.
It could be his voice. It could be his appearance. I think that it is probably both, in conjunction with the character he creates through the composition of his jokes. Nevertheless, I am more interested in its effect on Cole’s set than its nebulous origins.
It allows Cole to transform content that should not be funny into oddly endearing comedy. The following is closer to life advice than a joke, “If somebody calls you at midnight, they want to fuck. If they call you at 3:00 a.m., you were their last choice. You’re welcome.” However, gentle reader, put some thought into it. Think about which individual called Cole at three in the morning, how Cole found out that he was that individual’s last choice, and then the process that turned that pain into a joke. (The bit still works—even if my explanation doesn’t work for you.) The lifestyle-advice-as-joke does not simply work because the joke is being presented within the context of standup, but because Cole’s cool allows him the space to say things that shouldn’t be funny, lets you fill in the gaps until that piece of life advice becomes a fully fleshed out scenario, and find that comic joy within your own soul from his scenario.
The importance of this is twofold. First, it means that Cole’s jokes are going to almost always work better in performance than on the page, adjacent to my overbearing prose. Second, and more importantly, it means that Cole’s performance is more than a dictatorial relationship between the giver of jokes and the receiver of jokes.
Cole shares in the audience’s role of evaluating and the audience shares in Cole’s role in creating humor. And, for a brief moment—when the line between Cole and us is blurred between “we” and “I”—we share in something special. Through Cole, dear reader, we become cool.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While on the campaign trail in August 2016, then-candidate Donald Trump spoke to an auditorium full of evangelical pastors in Orlando. Over the course of the roughly 30-minute speech, he touched on topics from Secretary Hillary Clinton’s emails to the job market, but he spoke most passionately about Christianity in America and its supposed decline. He said to the crowd, “You’ve been silenced like a child. You’ve been silenced, you’ve been silenced. Strong, brilliant, great people that want to do the right thing.” In the same speech, true to character, he bragged about ditching the professionally written speech for the event, claimed to have a heart as big as “almost” anyone in the room, and stated that “nobody’s gotten rich by betting against Donald Trump.”
Since the middle of the 20th century, Midwesterners have prioritized moral character when evaluating politicians and presidential candidates. Most of this is driven by religion—the Bible is still an authority in the homes of millions of Midwesterners, and evangelism, the most right-leaning sect of Christianity, thrives in Midwestern states like Indiana, South Dakota, and Missouri. Driven by faith, these people feel morally obligated to vote for those who promise to uphold traditional family values.
That changed in 2016. Many of those who had voted for composed politicians like Governor Mitt Romney and Senator John McCain cast their ballots for Donald Trump, a man garish in speech and behavior. Eighty-one percent of evangelical Christians voted for him, and his approval rating among them is 28 percent higher than the national average. White Catholics, which comprise relatively large percentages of states like Nebraska and Wisconsin, supported him at nearly 60 percent. How could the same base, and the same party, reconcile  its longstanding values with Trump’s obvious affront to traditional conservative morality? How could they embrace someone so antithetical to Christ—a rich man who plates his personal home in gold and admits to groping women?
Trump’s evangelical following shouldn’t be so surprising—in fact, it makes a lot of sense. His evangelical followers’ unquestioning worship is mirrored by their religious practices; like God, Trump embodies a complete authority. Moreover, evangelicals are used to defending their values and beliefs without hard evidence. When Trump says he’ll build the wall, but doesn’t explain how, or promises he’ll defeat ISIS, but won’t offer more details, his opponents hear a man spewing empty promises. But evangelicals, well-trained in putting their faith in a higher power, overcome the difficulty of believing him.
Their faith changes how they approach objectivity, too. Whether from a fake news site or Trump’s mouth, evangelicals accept lies about the country or other leaders because they feel true. There is no way to prove that the Bible is actually the word of God. But Christians, especially the most devoted of them, have faith that it is. Their religion is not based in logic—it’s based in emotional truths they’ve learned to accept.
Evangelicals’ willingness to defend Trump solely because he is Christian makes intuitive sense, but this phenomenon is actually a reflection of changing religious norms. Zack Hunt, a writer and Yale Divinity School graduate, blames widespread misinterpretation of “sola fide” for evangelical Christians’ acceptance of Trump. “Sola fide,” the battle cry of the Protestant Reformation, promises salvation by faith alone. People are no longer required to do good deeds or treat others with kindness; all that matters is resignation to the faith. It doesn’t matter that Trump is a wealth-flaunting braggart and adulterer; all that matters is his verbal, superficial acceptance of Christianity. Entirely alienated from altruism and no longer burdened by the need to behave well in order to get to heaven, evangelical Christians’ support of Trump moves forward freely.
But the most magnetic aspect of Trump’s identity may be the perceived estrangement from society he and evangelicals share. According to a study by the Pew Research Center, evangelicals cite Trump’s role as a “political outsider” as the number two reason for their support. They feel threatened in a country that becomes less religious each year. Their beliefs are scrutinized near constantly. They’re sick of being picked on, and Trump’s unapologetic response to criticism causes them to identify with and admire him.
Their suppressed anger finds solace in Trump’s crude tweets and responses to those that insult him. Though undeniably un-Christlike, he embodies an attitude evangelicals wish they could voice themselves. Trump’s capitalization on this weakness effectively solicits their support; he not only reminds them that they’ve been ostracized, but states that he has been too. But as we have already seen during his first 10 months in office, the symbiotic relationship between Trump and his evangelical constituency is only destructive to the rest of us.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Among the many frivolous things for which we are forced to allot space in our brains is the campaign afoot to change the notorious last line of the fourth verse of “Fair Harvard”: “Till the stock of the Puritans die.” The College’s goal for this latest round of self-defacement is “to affirm that Harvard’s motto, Veritas, speaks to and on behalf of all members of our community, regardless of background, identity, religious affiliation, or viewpoint.” I need hardly point out that virtually no Harvard student has even the vaguest idea what the words of the alma mater are, but the College has nonetheless brought every available weapon of Inclusion and Belonging to bear on correcting this imagined grievance.
Now, as an Irish Catholic, I have absolutely no interest in defending Puritans, but I do have an interest in defending good taste and common sense, of which the Task Forces and Committees around here are perennially bereft.  In that vein, let us examine the “longlist” of possible replacement lines that the College has published for our consideration.
Six of the 20 options can be immediately eliminated for failure to rhyme; among these are “Brightly shining, ever glorified” (which also puts emphasis on the wrong syllables of words) and “Pressing steadfastly onward for aye.” The author of the second was obviously trying so hard to be Robert Burns that he neglected to notice that “aye,” when it means “always,” rhymes with “day.”
“Veritas be Thy Destiny’s guide” and “Veritas be Thy Ancestor’s pride” force the stress to the last syllable of “Veritas,” which is awkward. What is more awkward is the capitalization of “Thy” as if Fair Harvard were God, which it ain’t. Furthermore, “Ancestor’s” is majuscule and in the singular, whereas in the first verse we see “ancestors’” minuscule and in the plural, which is much more literate.
Speaking of literacy, we must wonder what the author of “And let Veritas—Truth—never die” thinks of ours, not trusting that we will be able to decipher what the funny Latin word means. Nor can I imagine how in the world Truth could die. Another line, “As True North guides our way from on high,” produces a metaphor purée: Two lines before, we were gliding on “Truth’s current,” so we cannot have Truth be both the medium of transport and the navigational gauge.
Likewise, “Like the sun’s blessed light in the sky” won’t do, for the preceding line is “Be the herald of Light and the bearer of Love,” which leaves us with a grammatical ambiguity in which both options are wrong. Either the proposed line modifies “be,” in which case the whole thing is an entreaty to be the herald of light as the sun’s blessed light is the bearer of light, which is nonsensical; or it’s “Light” and “Love” that are like the sun’s blessed light, which idea reminds me of the Teletubbies.
Then we have this outrageous affront to decency and civilization: “Be our haven that never shall die.” “Haven” features prominently in the name of the hometown of that safety school we are fond of beating up on the gridiron, and I will not suffer dog-whistles to the Yalies to be featured in Harvard’s alma mater.
Next on the block is the motley collection of 10th-rate philosophical hairballs such as, “Till the mind and compassion ally” and “Setting wisdom and justice on high.” I am not strictly sure what the latter means. The most likely explanation is that we are being exhorted to make wisdom and justice our priorities, but it actually sounds as if the author were talking about a toaster oven or a washing machine (“No, dear, set it on high!”).
Now for a few that are just plain strange, first among which is “For each creature of land, sea or sky.” I must confess myself unaware that a Harvard education directly benefits archaebacteria and the emerald ash borer. We also read “While the banners of Veritas fly,” i.e., be Harvard for as long as Harvard exists, which is silly. And somebody had the audacity to maintain the mention of the Puritans, doctored slightly: “Lest the hope of the Puritans die.” That might be inclusive to the extent that one need no longer be from the Puritan stock in order for the mission of Harvard to “speak to” him or her, but the hope of the Puritans was probably not very inclusive by the standard of “religious affiliation or viewpoint,” so it is probably ausgeschlossen to mention them at all.
That leaves five suggestions. “Till the end of the ages draws nigh,” isn’t bad, but it would make more sense to want Harvard to endure till the end of the ages actually arrives, which would make for a longer lifespan. “‘Til the stars cease to brighten the sky” and “Till the stars in the firmament die” are coherent, but the image they use is quite irrelevant to the rest of the entire song. The first verse, for example, uses “First flow’r of their wilderness! Star of their night!” That takes a general image and anchors it to Harvard, whereas the two proposals unmoor Harvard and let it drift to a general image.
Only two remain: “Lest the glory of Veritas die” and “Lest the hopes of our ancestors die.” These are undesirable because they are negatives at the end of a very positive song. “Till the stock of the Puritans die,” to the Harvardian of 1832, meant “Till the end of the world.” The spirit of the song is to go on boldly until the end. The two proposed lines, however, are defensive, not at all the attitude we want to impart on our graduates on Commencement Day.
In other words, I’d hate to see the entries that didn’t make the list. Leave the song alone and get back to figuring out why no one’s heard of it in the first place.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
November has rolled around, and with it the beginning of a new Undergraduate Council election season, soon to be filled with a litany of campaign speeches, flyers, and promises by candidates across campus. In view of the unfulfilled promises of previous UC presidential and vice presidential candidates, we hope that this vote will bring new and relatively more substantive actions.
The last few years have not given us much hope and trust in the UC’s campaign promises. We have been skeptical of lofty proposals and schemes that sound great on a flyer but which have not resulted in concrete progress, let alone deliverables for the student body. We therefore have no reason to believe that the next iteration of UC candidates will be any more likely to achieve the goals they set if those goals remain big, abstract promises.
For this reason, we believe the candidates should not focus on grand schemes, but instead only make promises if they are certain they will be able to fulfill them with concrete plans of action. We also hope they focus on the ways in which they can best exercise their influence, namely in their role as representatives of the student body.
As we have opined in the past, however, accountability and engagement are a two way road. The student body has largely been apathetic in its dealings with the UC, with stories of whole Houses not voting at all. It is the duty of the student body to vote in all UC elections and become engaged with their representatives and their policies throughout the year. After a national election cycle in which citizens were criticized for being apathetic and uninformed, we should be critical of the fact that our own campus has acted similarly.
Likewise, we believe that all UC leaders should stay engaged with all areas of student life, regardless of whether or not they are in the UC’s “traditional” realm of scope. The UC president and vice president, specifically, should stay engaged with issues beyond those that affect them personally.
This is not to say that the current UC leadership, one of whom is a member of a final club, has not focused on other issues—far from it. But the issue of the sanctions has had outsize importance in considerations of the UC’s role as representatives of the student body.
We encourage future UC leaders to consider these as major responsibilities of their office. This should matter both during the campaign season and during their tenure. After all, they have a mandate to serve as a mediator between the administration, faculty, and student body. As a result, it is important that UC presidential tickets have prior experience in the body, as they are likeliest to know how the Council’s system of governance and student-administration relations work.
We hope all candidates are willing to discuss the issues at hand and work to truly effect change for the College’s student body. To that end, it is important that the UC has a substantive, didactic, and constructive campaign season this year.
This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board. It is the product of discussions at regular Editorial Board meetings. In order to ensure the impartiality of our journalism, Crimson editors who choose to opine and vote at these meetings are not involved in the reporting of articles on similar topics.

UPDATED: November 1, 2017 at 12:30 p.m.
Three tickets will run for Undergraduate Council President and Vice President in the Council’s upcoming presidential election.
The tickets include Mather House resident Conor Healy ’19 and Kirkland House representative Parth C. Thakker ’18-19, Dunster House representative Victor C. Agbfafe ’19 and Kirkland House resident Michael K. Bervell ’19, and Cabot House representative Catherine L. Zhang ’19 and UC Treasurer and Mather House representative Nicholas D. Boucher ’19.
All three tickets obtained the 150 required signatures by 11:59 p.m. on Oct. 30 to get on the ballot. Last year, four tickets ran for UC leadership, and the year before, three tickets contended for the Council’s presidency and vice presidency.
This year’s candidates notably feature no sophomores, a departure from last year when half the tickets featured sophomore vice presidential candidates. Neither of those tickets won.
Healy’s ticket is the only to feature a UC outsider at the top of the ticket. Healy is running with Thakker, who currently serves on the Council, and each ticket has at least one incumbent representative.
Healy founded and leads the Open Campus Initiative, a student group that looks to “test” the limits of free speech at Harvard. The group has brought controversial speakers like sociologist Charles A. Murray ’65 to campus.
The only other outsider running this year, Michael K. Bervell ’19, is running as vice president with Agbafe at the top of the ticket.
UC Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 said he believes all of the tickets are qualified and hopes to see them run “issues-focused” campaigns.
“We’re very excited. I think it’s been a pleasure for us to serve in this capacity and to work with a wide variety of students and also with the Council,” he said. “We wish the best of luck to each of three candidates that are running. We urge them to run an issues-focused campaign and we think that any of them would do great.”
He added that he is awaiting to see their platforms and that keeping in line with precedent, he and UC President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 will not endorse a ticket.
The election’s campaign period begins on Nov. 8, and voting will occur from noon on Nov. 13 until noon on Nov. 16.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Like any other weekday afternoon, students flooded the Center for Government and International Studies building and walked past freshman dorms in the yard, but on Tuesday these students included a voodoo doll, several clowns, and a human-sized banana.
In celebration of Halloween, the Center for Government and International Studies hosted a trick-or-treating event in the afternoon and freshman proctors handed out candy in front of their dorms in the evening.  The CGIS event included information about various international studies programs and offered a host of food from around the world.
“I went because of the free food and boba,” said Michael Bao ’21. “But while I was there I found out a lot about different programs.”
While many students, like Bao, did not dress up for the holiday, some said they put a lot of effort into their costumes.
Avril Saavedra '21 said she paid attention to every detail of her voodoo doll costume, which involved heavy makeup including fake blood.
“I have been planning it for a year. It only took me five hours to make the pieces and two hours to put it all together,” she said.
Saavedra said that some people—and animals—were frightened by her costume.
“There was a dog who saw me and immediately ran away and there were many people who did the same thing,” she said.
Multiple students masquerading as clowns roamed the Yard. Tuong H. Huynh ‘18 dressed as“Twisty the Clown” from American Horror Story. He said that preparation for the costume was intense and that this was his first time creating his own costume instead of buying one.
“The makeup took around an hour and a half,” he said. “The costume took like thirty five minutes to put on. I put the makeup on by myself and I had to learn how to put on eyeliner,”
Other students opted for the less time-intensive onesie costume, wearing bodysuits resembling Pikachu, Winnie the Pooh characters, and animals. Francis J. Choi ‘21 wore a giraffe onesie.
“I just had this onesie lying around so I thought it would be appropriate to wear today. I do usually dress up for Halloween,” Choi said.
Students also engaged in the festivities with single costume pieces like hats or animal ears.
“It’s Halloween. I still wanted to be in costume so I’m wearing a regular outfit but with cat ears,”  Starr H. Rhee ’21 said.
A handful of freshman ate lunch in Annenberg Hall in costume. Jenna Moustafa ’21 wore a banana suit that she said she has owned since the third grade. She added that she planned to wear the costume to tennis practice.
“I just wanted to dress up. This isn’t for extra credit,” she said. “I love this costume.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council passed legislation urging University President Drew G. Faust to drop Harvard’s appeal of a National Labor Relations Board decision invalidating a 2016 unionization election.
This summer, representatives from Harvard appealed an NLRB ruling mandating that Harvard hold a re-vote of  a November 2016 election deciding whether eligible students can form a union. Representatives from Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers have repeatedly argued that the University did not generate an adequate voter list for the November election. The NLRB in Washington, D.C., which is composed of presidential appointees, will hear the appeal.
 At the UC’s general meeting on Sunday, representatives overwhelmingly voted to support the unionization effort’s attempts to hold a re-vote. Members of activist group Student Labor Action Movement spoke before the meeting, outlining their attempts to help student teaching and research assistants form a union.
Although the legislation passed, representatives fiercely debated stakes of requesting that Harvard drop its appeal.
Numerous representatives spoke in favor of the letter, including Quincy House representative Sarah S. Fellman ’18. Fellman urged the Council to pass the legislation in order to advance “democracy” in the unionization process.
“This is about democracy. It’s about making sure that everyone who is allowed to vote can vote. It doesn't necessarily mean you’re in favor or not in favor of the union, but it means that you believe that the people that are going to be affected by this should have the chance to make their voices heard fairly,” she said.
Treasurer Nicholas D. Boucher '19, however, said he thought the University has a legal right to appeal the NLRB’s decision.
“I’ve got no problem with unions in general, but I do think that it seems to me like it was a very fair vote last year and it also seems like the University has the right to appeal this process,” he said.
Mather House representative Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18 said that despite Harvard’s legal right to appeal the decision, the University should not pursue its appeal.
“Harvard can appeal this decision, but they shouldn’t,” he said. “I’m not going to sit here as an elected representative and tell people who are going to be affected by this, including 400 undergraduate workers, that they shouldn’t have a say in this election.”
Harvard has defended its move to appeal the NLRB decision, arguing that the University held a fair election.
“The University believes strongly that the November 2016 election results, which reflect the votes and voices of the majority of eligible voters, should stand,” Director of Labor and Employee Relations Paul R. Curran wrote in an email to students on July 10.
After passing the legislation, the student body agreed to table legislation to fund a new app for House grilles, the student-run late night eateries in some Houses, and instead decided to discuss the matter at their next general meeting on Nov. 5.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If Satire V and On Harvard Time have their way, undergraduate voters in this fall’s UC elections will be casting their ballots on whether or not to make a rare virus the “official disease” of Harvard.
The effort—which will succeed if a petition backed by the two groups garners 650 signatures by Nov. 5—would list “Should mumps be the official disease of Harvard?” as a referendum question on the ballot of the Undergraduate Council’s upcoming election.
Last year, the comedy groups backed a similar attempt to make the Harvard turkey an official mascot. Though the turkey referendum successfully made an appearance on the ballot last year, it failed to pass. Satire V President Antonia Chan '18 said she hopes that this year will bring a serious debate on the significance of mumps in the Harvard community after the UC “ignored” the turkey question last year.
“I think it’s high time,” Chan said. “We’ve had a weird outbreak every single semester, so give UHS the recognition they deserve for giving us an official disease.”
Mumps took campus by storm the in spring of 2016 after two confirmed cases snowballed into a total of 66 cases amongst Harvard affiliates. Several students were held in quarantine as University Health Services tried to halt the virus’ spread.
As of June 2017, there were still two cases of mumps at Harvard. Although no new mumps cases have been reported this semester, both On Harvard Time and Satire V said they hope to memorialize the impact mumps had.
“Mumps has proven that anyone, regardless of race, religion, gender, or sexual identity, can be quarantined in the Harvard Inn,” a Facebook event description for the petition reads. “In light of recent conversations about institutional elitism, we need mumps more than ever.”
According to On Harvard Time Producer Tess Saperstein '18, other contenders for the proposal included recognizing Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease—after confirmed cases of the ailment, which generally affects infants, in Currier House— and endorsing the Harvard Turkey as University President Drew G. Faust’s replacement. Ultimately, Saperstein said, the collaborators decided that mumps “really represented the zeitgeist of Harvard.”
“What’s most important is that we give the people a choice, give Harvard students the options, and then let democracy play out,” Saperstein said.
Not all students are sold on the implications of this year’s proposal to honor the infectious disease, though.
“I mean people have been quarantined for it or whatever, but honestly I think it is embarrassing. I wouldn’t want Harvard to be known as the mumps college,” said Krystal Howell '18.

Harvard’s next president should serve as a leader not only for the University but also for all of higher education, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said during an interview last week.
Over the course of the roughly hour-long interview, Khurana also laid out his broad thoughts on the ongoing presidential search, which began this summer when University President Drew G. Faust announced plans to step down in June 2018. Since Faust’s announcement, Harvard has mobilized to find her successor, forming a search committee—comprising all twelve members of the Harvard Corporation and three members of the Board of Overseers—and sending committee members across the country to solicit input from various alumni groups.
Khurana declined to say whether the committee has solicited his input, too. But he offered his view of the most important task facing Harvard’s 29th president.
“I think the next president is someone who is not only a leader for Harvard, but is a leader for higher education,” Khurana said last Friday. “I believe that President Faust has really represented that role in an incredible way—she’s played a critical role as a spokesperson for higher education.”
Khurana listed Faust’s efforts to “advance Harvard’s research mission” as an example of her best work in this area. Since the election of President Donald Trump, Faust has ramped up her political advocacy: making lobbying trips to Washington, defending humanities funding in a New York Times op-ed, and overseeing Harvard’s filing of two amicus briefs challenging Trump’s executive orders.
In the interview, Khurana also discussed what he sees as the proper role of students in the search process. Harvard formally created a student advisory committee for the search—composed of 18 students, both undergraduate and graduate—in mid-September.
“I think it’s really important for the student committee to inform students what the President does,” Khurana said. “That’s not always clearly understood among students: what the job of a president of a university is.”
Harvard students have historically played a limited role in presidential searches; this year’s student advisory committee is the second-ever group of its kind in recent memory. Some on campus have already called for greater undergraduate involvement this time around, even suggesting the University add students to the official search committee—as Princeton and Stanford have done in past presidential searches.
Khurana declined to answer a question asking whether he thinks students should sit on the search committee.
That committee is now winnowing its candidate pool—and, according to more than a dozen prominent Harvard alumni and professors, is likely considering Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria, whom Khurana said he considers a close friend. Khurana declined to say whether he thinks Nohria is well-suited for the position in the interview last week.
He also declined to say whether Nohria has expressed interest in the role.
“Dean Nohria is an individual who I have the utmost respect for,” Khurana said. “He shaped me as a student, as a scholar, as a research collaborator, as a mentor. He made me a better person.”
Khurana declined to say whether he thinks Harvard’s next president should come from within the University’s ranks. He also refused to directly answer questions asking whether he had discussed the search with William F. Lee ’72, a Boston lawyer who leads the Corporation, or any other search committee members.
“As Dean of the College, I speak with many people about what is happening at the College, which is part of my regular work,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said last week that a preliminary set of recommendations from a University-wide diversity task force has prompted him to attempt to make it easier for undergraduates to cross-register at other Harvard schools.
During an interview Friday, Khurana also defended the report against critics who charge that the task force’s work did not specifically address some student and faculty concerns, including the absence of a more robust ethnic studies program at Harvard. He also said the report highlighted a need to focus on improving staff development.
The Presidential Task Force for Inclusion and Belonging released a draft executive summary last month containing a set of “Shared Standards” and recommendations for historically marginalized groups to engage in “full membership in the Harvard community.” The draft is the first document released to the public by the task force, which was convened by University President Drew G. Faust in 2016.
Khurana said that he thought the task force’s recent draft pointed to the role diversity and inclusion for faculty, students, and staff will play in ensuring “Harvard excellence in the twenty-first century.”
“Whatever specific rank or role that they have, it is a recognition that staff are critical enablers of our students and our faculty’s research and teaching mission,” Khurana said. “And so this holistic kind of community point I thought was really important.”
Faust convened the task force after a College-specific group recommended that Harvard take a more University-wide approach to diversity and inclusion efforts. The College working group’s 37-page report recommended a series of wide-ranging reforms focusing on three main areas: increasing training around student life diversity issues, improving the diversity of departmental offerings, and promoting diversity among the faculty and College’s disciplinary bodies.
Khurana said that the College worked with the University-wide task force committee in its information gathering stage.
“The College did work with the committee in providing data and information and dialogue on sets of concerns, issues, our own experience with doing a belonging and inclusion report as well,” Khurana said, referencing the 2015 report.
Khurana also noted some ways the College could take internal action on the draft of proposal. He mentioned cross-registration across Harvard’s 12 schools and “staff development” as actionable items.
“I think the area of staff development and making sure people feel they have a lot of development opportunities and programs to get to know more about students but also for personal growth and development,” he said.
Some students and faculty, though, have been critical of the University-wide task force’s work so far. In particular, advocates of ethnic studies flagged the lack of language specifically around race and ethnicity in the report and charged that the document’s ambiguity leaves questions about the substance of the proposals.
The report's proposals did not explicitly call for a dedicated ethnic studies program or center at the University, which proponents of ethnic studies have requested for decades. In its most recent effort last December, the Ethnic Studies Coalition circulated a petition across the University to create such a center and bolster faculty hiring and renewal across Harvard.
Government professor and task force co-chair Danielle S. Allen called the decision to leave explicit mention of ethnic studies out of the report a result of the movement being “College-specific.” Khurana defended the task force’s choice.
“My understanding reading the report is that it was really meant as a University-level report and didn’t want to go into school-specific programming,” he said.
Khurana fielded similar criticisms from students at the College following the release of a 2015 diversity report. Then, students raised concerns about the absence of courses on gender, ethnic, or cultural studies in the College’s core curriculum, the accountability of administrators, and the inclusion of all minority groups on campus.
The task force is currently gathering feedback from groups and administrators across the University to finalize its version of “Shared Standards” and set of recommendations. The final report is scheduled for released at the end of the semester of beginning of next spring.

In the battle for the hungry stomachs of Harvard undergraduates, pizza chain Papa John’s recently employed deals to gain a greater share of an already competitive market.
Just this semester, Papa John’s flooded student inboxes with free pizza coupons, additional discounts, and a complementary Papa John’s refrigerator magnet. The advertising campaign is part of a new collaboration with Harvard Student Agencies, a student-run corporation that maintains a close relationship with the University.
But competition in the Square is fierce. National giants Papa John’s and Domino’s have to contend with perennially popular local pizzerias, Otto and Pinocchio’s—mainstays of Harvard Square.
Though Domino’s and Papa John’s are both national pizza chains, their prices are similar to those of local pizzerias. A 12” cheese is $14.20 at Papa John’s, $7.99 at Domino’s, $11.70 at Pinocchio's, and $10.50 at Otto.
Some students' allegiances to pizza chains remain salient even in the face of discounted pies. When Maha J. Al-Suwaidi '19 received her coupon for a free medium Papa John’s pizza, she said she threw it away.
“Papa John’s is okay. I think Dominos is better," Al-Suwaidi said. “I don’t normally order pizza, so I didn’t see a reason to keep it around.”
On the other hand, other students say they are long-time lovers and fanatics of Papa John’s.
“I would always eat Papa John’s back home, so that’s why I prefer it better,” said Caroline Ko '21. “Growing up, all I ate was Domino’s, but then I switched to Papa John’s because they had better ingredients.”
Others, like Mason Watson ’21 disparaged Domino’s for putting “too many spices in their crust.”
“It gives me a headache,” he said.
The marketing campaign may be having mixed success. Some students said they had never ordered Papa John’s, or Domino’s, and never received the coupon. Emma Y. Lin ’21 didn’t get coupon herself, but received a discount code from a friend.
Papa John’s is pretty comparable to other brands, she said.
“Pizzerias in the Square have very weird flavor combinations. Sometimes it’s nice to just have a regular pizza,” she said.
In recent years, Harvard Square turnover has been turbulent—even in the pizza market. Just last year, Uno Pizzeria and Grill on JFK Street closed its doors. Last month, regional pizza chain &pizza approved hotly-debated plans to open a storefront on Brattle Street next to the COOP Bookstore.
For other Harvard students, proximity remains the most important factor in determining where to purchase a pizza—an advantage possessed by Square-based pizzerias Otto and Pinocchio's.
“Otto is right across the street from our dorm, so I just go to Otto, ” said Derek Woo ‘20, who claims to have never tried Papa John’s.

With the return of Classroom to Table this semester, participating restaurants are welcoming the increase in groups of students and faculty members flocking to their Harvard Square businesses.
Classroom to Table provides money for groups of three to five students and a faculty member to dine over lunch or dinner. The program encourages students to have one-on-one conversations with their professors over a casual meal rather than a traditional classroom environment.
Due to insufficient funding, Classroom to Table ended early in spring 2017, and the Office of Undergraduate Education implemented a cap on the number of reservations and a new funding amount per person. After the reinstatement of the program, students can participate a maximum of four times per semester and each person can spend up to $30 per reservation.
The six participating Harvard Square restaurants include Grafton Street, The Hourly Oyster House, Legal Sea Foods, Park Restaurant, Russell House Tavern, and Temple Bar. Five of the six restaurants are owned by Grafton Group Hospitality, with Legal Sea Foods being the exception. Since the restoration of the program, restaurant staff have noticed an increase in customers.
Henry E. McCauley, a manager of Russell House Tavern, said that the program allows more people to come to Harvard Square restaurants.
“I think it’s great. It brings a lot of new people in who may not always get to come out and experience the dining,” McCauley said.
McCauley, who has worked with the company for about a year, said business will continue as usual even with the increase in customers. He said that Russell House Tavern will still do everything they can to ensure their customers have a good experience.
Morgan E. Carney, the bar manager of Grafton Street, said he observed a difference in sales after the reinstatement of the program.
“It’s been a noticeable boost in terms of our business, and it’s been a great boost in mingling Harvard with local businesses,” Carney said.
Carney, who has been tending bar at the restaurant for over 11 years, also said he thinks Classroom to Table helps “students and professors engage with each other in a different environment.”
“It’s something I wish they had when I was in college because it’s kind of cool to see the professor-student relationship outside of the classroom,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To say that that the 2017 Ivy League Football season has not gone according to plan would be an understatement. Many pundits picked Cornell and Columbia to finish in the bottom of the league, but four games into conference play, the Empire State colleges find themselves tied for first with Yale. Meanwhile, traditional powerhouses Harvard, Princeton, and Penn find themselves in the middle and bottom half of the standings. With three weeks remaining, and with no tiebreaker for league champions, the Ancient Eight football title race is wide open, with seven of the eight teams still in contention.
BROWN
Unfortunately for the Bears, their 0-4 league record has eliminated them from contention. But make no mistake—Brown still has an opportunity to have a say in the championship. With games against Yale in New Haven, Conn., Dartmouth at Fenway Park, and on the road at Columbia, the Bears can play spoiler down the stretch.
COLUMBIA
The Cinderella story of the 2017 season, Columbia is off to its hottest start since 1996. The Lions lost their first league game of the season against Yale on Saturday afternoon. This result narrowed Columbia’s margin of error as the team seeks its first league title since 1961, and only its second Ivy League championship. At 3-1, the Lions still control their own destiny, but huge matchups against Harvard and at Cornell loom ahead. Fortunately for the Lions, their final game of the season comes at home against cellar-dwelling Brown, giving Columbia arguably the most straightforward path to the championship.
CORNELL
After opening the season with a 49-24 loss at Yale, the Big Red rebounded, winning games against heavily favored Harvard, and Brown. A game-winning field goal in the dying seconds of Saturday night’s tilt at Princeton lifted Cornell to a shocking 3-1 league record and a share of first place, one of the biggest surprises of the 2017 season. With a date against Columbia in Ithaca looming two weeks out, the Big Red has control of its own fate. Winning out would mean at least a shared Ancient Eight crown, the program’s first since 1990.
DARTMOUTH
The Big Green opened the season with two nail-biting wins over Penn and Yale and appeared primed for a run at the hardware. Unfortunately for Dartmouth, one-possession losses to Columbia and at Harvard have left the team in the middle of the Ivy League pack at 2-2. Like Princeton, the Big Green will have to win out and hope for a Lions loss. However, with two of its three games at home, and the third on the road at Brown, Dartmouth remains in the hunt.
HARVARD
A 52-17 home loss against Princeton two weeks ago deflated title hopes for the Crimson, but a 25-22 comeback against Dartmouth kept Harvard in the race for a share of its fourth championship in five years. The Crimson has a must-win matchup Saturday in New York City against Columbia. A win against the upstart Lions, followed by a victory over Penn, would keep Harvard’s title hopes alive entering the final weekend of the season. If Cornell were to lose a game to the Big Green, the Quakers, or Columbia, the Crimson would ride into New Haven with an opportunity to beat Yale to earn a share of the championship.
PENN
Home losses against Dartmouth and Yale, combined with a heartbreaking overtime defeat at Columbia, have stacked the deck against the one-win Quakers. Penn’s bumpy start to 2017 contrasts with recent years, as the Quakers have shared the title in the last two seasons. Technically, Penn can still earn part of the crown, but that situation would involve some ridiculous events, most notably Brown winning out. More likely, the Quakers will have an opportunity to affect the race by playing spoiler against Princeton and Cornell at home and Harvard on the road.
PRINCETON
Princeton’s 52-17 win at Harvard two weeks ago appeared to poise the Tigers for a run at the championship. Last Saturday night, however, a heartbreaking 29-28 loss at home against Cornell left Princeton at 2-2. The Tigers’ road to a share of the title would likely require a 3-0 finish against Penn, Yale, and Dartmouth, supplemented with a Columbia loss.
YALE
A 28-27 road loss at Dartmouth is all that separates the Bulldogs from a 4-0 record. However, the Bulldogs rose to the occasion last week, soundly beating previously undefeated Columbia. Tied atop the standings at 3-1, wins against Brown and Princeton would set up a Harvard-Yale game with serious implications. If Yale were to defeat the Crimson in the 134th edition of The Game, the Elis would then secure a piece of the title. Yale last earned a share in 2006.

In a series that began on Sunday and will continue through the Crimson’s season opener on Nov. 10 against MIT, men’s basketball beat writer Stephen Gleason will look at Harvard’s 13 nonconference opponents. Coming in at No. 11 is Fordham.
No. 13: MIT
No. 12: Holy Cross
Fordham
2017-2018 Matchup: Wednesday, December 6 at Rose Hill Gymnasium, Bronx, N.Y. (7:00 p.m.)
2016-2017 Record: 13-19 overall, 7-11 Atlantic Ten
2016-2017 Matchup: Harvard, 64, Fordham, 52
Head Coach: Jeff Neubauer (3rd season)
Key Returning Players: Jr. G Joseph Chartouny (was second on last year’s team in points per game and led the team in assists); Sr. G Will Tavares (started nine games a season ago and averaged 5.6 points per contest)
Stat to Watch: 12: Harvard’s margin of victory over the Rams a season ago; it was Harvard’s second-largest nonconference margin of victory over a Division I team
Overview: The Rams struggled to rebound a season ago and return a very inexperienced frontcourt. While Fordham’s wings kept it in many games last year, it will need contributions from largely untested players, only two of whom started more than 10 games a season ago.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cathartic. Nerve-wracking. Decisive. Shocking. Necessary. Pick any adjective you want—Harvard football’s win over Dartmouth deserved all of them.
The story of Saturday’s game began eight days before, when Princeton whupped the Crimson. That 52-17 blowout was embarrassing, plain and simple. Embarrassing because the game happened at Harvard Stadium on a Friday night. Embarrassing because Tigers quarterback Chad Kanoff racked up 323 yards before halftime. Embarrassing because preseason polls had slated the two teams to tie for first, the Crimson had spent all year preparing for the contest, the season had hung in the balance, and still Princeton had made Harvard look like a bunch of high school sophomores playing against Aaron Rodgers and Randy Moss.
That embarrassment is gone. On Saturday, the Crimson delivered a classic. Down 14-0 near the end of the first half, Harvard seemed dead in the water. Then a Big Green player fumbled a punt return, a visiting coach punched out a window, and Harvard splashed back to life.
The second half opened with the best seven minutes of the season for the Crimson. In that span, Harvard mounted a 12-play touchdown drive and forced a three-and-out. The Crimson didn’t secure the win until the fourth quarter, when freshman quarterback Jake Smith tossed two scores and the defense snuffed out a final drive. But for all practical purposes, Harvard reclaimed the game—and by extension the season—late in the first half. That was when a drowning team learned to swim.
The timing was fortunate because Crimson coach Tim Murphy stacked most of his chips on the Dartmouth game. The Big Green may not seem like a classic rival, but the Hanover, N.H., program has forced nail-biters in four of the last five matchups.
Little surprise, then, that Murphy reserved something special for Dartmouth. Harvard dialed up a surprise pass on a reverse run (sophomore wideout Justice Shelton-Mosley decided not to throw), a flea-flicker (the ball sailed incomplete), and a wildcat pass (sophomore wide receiver Lavance Northington threw a touchdown).
The point of mentioning these surprise plays is to highlight the importance of the Big Green clash. Murphy threw the kitchen sink at Dartmouth. Then he threw the dishwasher. Had Harvard lost, the defeat would have crushed the team and quashed any remaining hope. But the Crimson has new life. The slate is clean, wiped smooth with a Big Green jersey. A new season—the championship season—begins now.
No unit earned more redemption than the secondary. Against Princeton, that group had more holes than a pasta strainer. Against Dartmouth, Harvard defensive backs won the game.
Senior safety Tanner Lee set the tone with forceful stops on the first two plays. Fellow senior safety Zach Miller has emerged as a vocal leader. On Saturday, senior cornerback Raishaun McGhee played shutdown coverage and caused the final interception. Senior safety Tim Haehl blocked a punt. And cornerback Isaiah Wingfield—who is listed as a freshman but plays more like a veteran—dove for a second-half pick.
The defensive performance animated everyone, even injured junior cornerback Wes Ogsbury. After Haehl lunged for his blocked punt, Ogsbury ignored his medical boot, sprinted off the bench, and skied for a shoulder bump.
The Harvard offense added more excitement. Quarterback Jake Smith is the real deal. He knows when to scramble, when to throw the ball out of bounds, and when to lob a prayer. Any play-caller would kill for this poise, and Smith is a freshman. Partly, the rookie has looked so competent because of explosive targets. Don’t let yardage statistics fool you—Shelton-Mosley remains the second-best wide receiver in the Ivy League. He has glue-like hands and rocket-like legs. Somehow, fellow junior wide receiver Adam Scott is even faster. Senior Ryan Antonellis has emerged as the latest in a line of touchdown-magnet tight ends. All these options steady Smith.
Veteran defense and invigorating offense—at times on Saturday, the Crimson showed the potential that made the team a trendy pick to win the Ancient Eight. That potential will have to continue in coming weeks, as Harvard faces a true gauntlet to close the season. This Saturday, the Crimson faces 6-1 Columbia—a program that will come out furiously after losing against Yale. The next Saturday, Harvard hosts a Penn program that has beaten the Crimson the last two years. And then comes The Game. Good luck making a prediction with that one.
More trials loom, but Harvard has survived so many already. A season-opening loss against Rhode Island. A one-score heartbreak against Cornell. A blowout against Princeton. Last Saturday, 60 inspired minutes atoned for most sins. Murphy was animated in the postgame press conference.
“I’ve seldom been prouder of a football team,” the coach said. “Why do you get into coaching? To coach kids that understand that if you fight, fight, fight, battle, battle, battle, and never give up, you give yourself a chance in life…. That’s my story, and I’m sticking to it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s just another pair of games on the schedule.
Like many weekends, two Ivy League opponents are coming to town. Like many weekends, four points will be on the line. Like many weekends, the Crimson is favored to win both matchups.
In a vacuum, these claims are all true. But for the Harvard men’s hockey team, the stakes are raised in this weekend’s contests with Yale and Brown.
“Yale’s the big rivalry for us. They always play us really tough,” tri-captain Eddie Ellis said. “It’s the last chance we’ll get to own our game…at home before we have to deal with going on the road against some big opponents that we have moving forward.”
Harvard (1-0-0, 1-0-0 ECAC) entertains the Bulldogs (1-1-0, 1-1-0) on Friday night before facing the Bears (1-1-0, 1-1-0) the following evening. These two games mark the Crimson’s final chances to tweak its systems and integrate its freshmen before hitting the road for a program-record nine-game stretch.
Due to Ivy League restrictions on season start dates, these two conference foes opened their seasons last weekend just like Harvard. Yale and Brown actually faced each other in a home-away series in which each team won a game in the opponent’s rink.
No matter where the Bulldogs rank in the ECAC, they always challenge the Crimson. The historic rivalry between the schools always elevates the intensity of their on-ice clashes.
“There’s so much history that goes into [the rivalry], and with that comes a lot of hype and energy,” Ellis said. “Guys from both teams are going to be really amped up to play in that game every single year. So I think that has a lot to do with why it always seems like a hard-fought battle.”
The Crimson’s annual slate against Yale is living proof that any team can win on any night. Last season, Harvard entered both regular season matchups as the favorite but nabbed just one point in the teams’ meeting in Cambridge. The 1-1 draw ended up being the Crimson’s final non-win until Minnesota-Duluth bounced the team from the Frozen Four over two months later.
“There’s nobody we’ve played more than Yale over the last six or seven years,” coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “There’s a lot of competition in the league, but for Yale, it’s different…. We know that this game is emotional, and I think you can throw the records and the pre-season predictions out the window.”
When Harvard goes head-to-head with ECAC teams this season, it will usually derive confidence from knowing it has the best player on the ice in junior forward Ryan Donato. Matchups with Yale are among the few instances that call this fact into question.
The Bulldogs have their own Donato counterpart, Joe Snively—also a junior, also a forward, and also a preseason all-ECAC nominee. Just the second Virginia native to play for Yale’s program in the last half-century, Snively led his team with 39 points last year, which included a 12-game scoring streak. In last weekend’s back-to-back with Brown, Snively potted a pair of goals.
Limiting the Bulldogs’ offensive centerpiece will be a tall task for the Crimson’s lock-down defensive pairing, composed of senior Wiley Sherman and sophomore John Marino. The shutdown responsibilities fall on everyone, however, according to coach Donato.
Yale will also get back senior Ryan Hitchcock, now the captain of the Bulldogs, after an injury cut his season short last year. Prior to the ailment, Hitchcock was averaging over a point per game. Now healthy, he should add to his team’s offensive potency.
“[Snively and Hitchcock] are two very gifted, high-end offensive players,” coach Donato praised. “We need to defend them with numbers and with intelligence…. I don’t think we look at it as one person needs to try to shut [Yale’s] offense down—it’s a team effort.”
It may sound strange, but another key to the Crimson’s game plan is to actually play with one. The Ivy rivals faced each other four times last season, and all the games were competitive. Yet, none of them ended the way Yale wanted.
By the end of the teams’ regular season matchup at the Whale, and right away in Game 1 of their ECAC playoff series at the Bright, things got chippy. Harvard, confident in its own abilities, is best off not participating in any post-whistle extracurriculars.
“The challenge with Yale is that the emotions are always there,” coach Donato said. “Regardless of what the records are, we know that it’s going to be an emotional game…. For us, it’s a great challenge against an excellent team that we expect to be around at the top of the league.”
The players likewise appreciate the emotions, providing for a fun Friday night.
“Both times I played them last year, it was always a chippy, physical game,” sophomore forward Nathan Krusko said. “It’s so much better when there’s that atmosphere and that intense competitiveness.”
On paper, Saturday night’s matchup promises to be a bit more lopsided than the always-close game against the Bulldogs.
The Crimson outscored Brown 9-0 in two games last season and has beaten the Bears four straight times entering the weekend. But even Brown cannot be taken too lightly.
In 2014-2015, despite Harvard almost doubling the Bears in league points, the Crimson dropped a 2-1 stunner to a Brown team that finished just 5-14-3 in the ECAC. Plus, the Providence dwellers split last weekend with Yale, so they may still provide a formidable challenge for Harvard.
“Brown is another great team coming into our building as an Ivy League and ECAC game,” Krusko noted.
In recent seasons, the Bears’ troubles have revolved around balance. Each year, Brown ices multiple impressive players, but the complementary pieces around them cannot seem to pull their weight in production.
In 2016-2017, the team’s top trio—then-junior forwards Max Willman, Charlie Corcoran, and Sam Lafferty—accounted for 50 percent of the overall scoring. The positive is that the Bears lost relatively little to graduation, and these high-end skaters have returned for their senior season. With a year of development, Brown should be at least a bit more competitive this year.
Regardless of the opposition, Harvard has just two games left before it enters its long spell of away contests. While every ECAC rivalry match is important, the Crimson wants more than just four points this weekend.
Still, all attention shifts to Yale and Brown in the coming days.
“I think we feel like the stakes are big every night,” coach Donato said. “Our guys want to put a couple of big wins in the bank this weekend. We do go on the road for an extended amount of time, but more importantly, we [just] want to play well.”

steeze /stēz/ noun
the quality of being effortlessly stylish or fashionable; a hybrid of “style” and “ease”
As the leaves change and autumnal loneliness settles in, the predicament of how to remain fashionable and simultaneously warm becomes increasingly relevant. You’re unsure if you should wear your club-embroidered Patagonia. You’re unsure if you should meticulously assemble an outfit to impress that girl you saw at the Goldman panel. You’re cold. You’re scared.  But have no fear. The solution comes in the form a wooly wearable blanket of pure steeze.
Flannels are great because they do not simply bolster your stylistic arsenal. They do so much more.

Plaid goes well with everything. You know what else goes well with everything? Comfort. A plaid flannel is a fashionable hug you can wear. It’ll match that forty dollar black concert tee you regret buying.

For perhaps the first time since many of us sat through Convocation, University President Drew G. Faust was seen mingling with us plebs Tuesday night. Posted outside of Mass. Hall, Faust passed out candy to a small line of undergraduates as part of the College Events Board’s Trick or Treat event.
Undergraduates were understandably eager to meet her. For many, this was the first time they had ever seen her up close. Sheridan Marsh ’20 said she only went trick-or-treating because she knew Faust would be there. Nicole Jarmula ’21 said she’d “been waiting all week for this.”
Perhaps to the chagrin of the folks who’ve placed all the passive-aggressive “eat healthy” posters in the dining halls (looking at you HUDS), Faust was generous in the amount of candy she dumped into each student’s hands. Whether they were using it to quench their craving for chocolate, or as a quick, sugary study break, students walked away from Mass. Hall satisfied.
“I’m planning to frame mine and put it up on my refrigerator,” Ryan T. Feng ’21 said, clutching a piece of candy.
If you think that’s absurd, then you’re not the only one. But who can blame the guy? We sometimes wonder if Faust is nothing more than a fever dream, an illusion we grasp for when we want someone to shake our first angrily at when something goes wrong on campus.
Tuesday was a truly historic day. It was definitely the first time any of us at Flyby have seen Faust mingling with average students, and with her final days as University President looming in June, it might just be the last.

Affordable housing, the preservation of Cambridge’s historical architecture, and voting rights for legal immigrants in local elections feature prominently in Ronald Benjamin’s platform. The Haitian-American founder of home health care agency ComWell Care, Inc. grew up in New York City, but has lived in Cambridge for the past 18 years. In that time he fell in love with Cambridge’s charm. But as times and places have begun to change, Benjamin feels that it is his duty to help preserve Cambridge.
Editor’s note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity. 
THE HARVARD CRIMSON: What do you think are the biggest issues facing the Cambridge City Council?
RONALD BENJAMIN: There’s only one issue. It’s not two, it’s not three—affordable housing.
THC: So what do you think Cambridge should be doing to provide affordable housing for its residents?
RB: What I’m proposing is that we increase affordable housing by 25 percent on new developments, and then negotiate with the current landlords to increase affordable housing on what’s on the market right now. I think by increasing affordable housing from what’s available right now, we’ll give people with low income and moderate income a choice to live here. And that would reduce the price of rent.
On any new development, there needs to be at least a minimum of 25 percent affordable housing for moderate- and low-income people. And the units should be promoting moderate income, because right now we have a lot of high-income units on the market. Empty! You know what I’m saying? When people are looking, you’ve got all these places in East Cambridge, West Cambridge, empty and nobody in them—because they’re so expensive for the average person, real person, or real families to afford them.
THC: How do you think the City should or should not preserve Harvard Square’s historical architecture?
RB: I say that Harvard Square should be preserved. Harvard Square is the heart and—to me—the soul of the city. This is where the residents meet, this is where the visitors come, this is where the students hang out. To preserve that history, I think, is very essential, if not necessary, to Cambridge.
I have a vision for Cambridge, which is to go back to how we started: a connected community, a community of people—men, women, and children—who know each other, live together, work together, go to places of worship together.
So how you go about that is—there are various tools that I’m offering—one is called “residency preference program” for people who are low-income and moderate-income. That is, when they apply for a job in the city, they should get automatic preference, granted that they have the minimum requirement for the job, they should get preference. So that these people can compete or can live here, they can have more money, to deal with the rise in inequality.  And also you offer job training for them, and job training for students, or their children at the high school. I’m a big proponent of STEM enrichment programs, because of my background in science.
THC: Do you think that the City Council has done enough to respond to Trump?
RB: I think overall they have responded—you know, they can do more, but they have put out a petition to impeach Trump. Some of the Council have petitioned to really strengthen our state of the city being a sanctuary city. Yeah, I believe that they’ve done enough, but more can be done.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should respond to President Donald Trump’s policies?
RB: More can be done in allowing more immigrants to be part of the system here. One thing that I’m pushing is a legal immigrant, or somebody who legally can live here should be able to participate in municipal elections. At the end of the day, this is a democracy, right? So the more people that participate, the more sustained the democracy is.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should balance the need for more bike lanes and concerns from residents who say they take up their parking space?
RB: I’m all for safety. We should find means to make bike lanes for the bikers here, but at the same time, you have to balance the need of businesspeople—particularly in Harvard Square, the areas where there’s high transportation and lots of trucks that bring goods. And then you have to be cautious about emergency situations, like fire, ambulances, so I think the city should be more cautious in creating these lanes.  There’s no parking space in Cambridge, so now with bike lanes, it’s getting worse. So to balance that, it’s trial and error.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should regulate the use and distribution of recreational marijuana?
RB: I haven’t given it great thought, but I’m for the medical use of marijuana. But in terms of the recreational, I haven’t really given it deep thought, so I’ll refrain from voicing my opinion. Although I suspect that Boston has something in place that’s working, but I don’t know if it would apply to Cambridge. So I need to look into it more, but I’m for it—it’s just the mechanisms that would apply to Cambridge, how it would work. I need greater thinking on this one.
THC: Why should Cantabrigians vote for you over other candidates?
RB: My message is simple: I’m the only person with a vision of Cambridge being a community. The only one. My message is “let’s connect the gap.” Connecting the gap between the haves and the have-nots. The clear vision of a connected community, where all are represented. I support anything that can promote a sense of community, a sense of wholeness, a sense of belonging, whether you’re a student, whether you’re a visitor, whether you’re a longtime resident or a week resident. We started as a community, we can always be a community. We have the minds, we have the people, we have the hearts. So what Cambridge needs is that again. We have soul, we have character, we have structure, so people can be happy and proud to live here.

For Josh Burgin, a real estate consultant, traffic should be the focus of the upcoming Cambridge City Council election. Burgin moved to Cambridge two years ago after working in software and politics. He values the cultural diversity of Cambridge and believes that affordable housing is crucial to keeping in middle class families in town. 
Editor’s note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
THE HARVARD CRIMSON: What do you think are the biggest issues facing the Cambridge City Council?
JOSH BURGIN: I’ve never lived in a city as well-funded and as organized as Cambridge that had crosswalks without signage. I know that sounds silly, but with the ongoing conflict between bikes and car-drivers, it just seems like such a real paradox to me that we’re not managing expectations well across all of our intersections. These sort of non-standard approaches to non traffic management create risk through insecurity.
THC: Why should Cantabrigians vote for you over other candidates?
JB: This sort of speaks to my experience and who I am as a person. I’m originally from out of area. I have a good bit of experience both in terms of state and local politics. I worked for a state legislator for some time. I worked as an aide to a county commissioner, which put me in touch with things very much on the front lines of policy making around things like land use, public planning, budgeting.
THC: What do you think Cambridge should be doing to provide affordable housing for its residents?
JB: So there’s a whole range of things—from inclusionary zoning, where a certain percentage is cut out, to full blown public housing projects. I think there’s also some room around density expansion. I am not looking for unrestricted growth. In the same vein, I still think it is important to build density around transit stations and perhaps even look at some new bus routes or new transit options where you’re going to put whatever density you’re going to put in place.
THC: How do you think Harvard and other Cambridge universities should work with the city to help the housing situation?
JB: MIT, through its Volpe Center project, is making some effort to expand its overall housing for students. Harvard does a great job when it comes to undergrads, but when it comes to graduate students, a pretty big percentage of overall graduate students are living in non-Harvard housing facilities. What that’s doing in those non-Harvard housing facilities, and neighborhoods effectively, is pushing up the cost of housing because those young people are effectively amortizing the cost of their housing across multiple years of debt service. This, by its very nature, is going to allow those students to rationalize in paying more than they would if it was a normal market where it was a month to month sort of income. Harvard can and should do more to help in housing their own students to open access to those mid-tier families that have been pushed out because pricing and costs have gone too high.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should respond to President Donald Trump’s policies?
JB: There’s two schools of thought: one says that let’s proactively campaign against the White House. This is emotional, it is effective in rallying support and I get it. I don’t think that it meets the day to day needs for the city. I get that tension and wanting to rail against the President and the administration, but I also think that this often distracts from the very real work that needs to be done in our neighborhoods.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should balance the need for more bike lanes and concerns from residents who say they take up their parking space?
JB: I’m absolutely about bike lanes. I understand that there is a significant percentage of the community who has chosen—in a good way—to prioritize bikes. And there’s a couple of tensions I see. One is between road bed and bike lane space, but it’s also between the small retailers that we say we want. We say we don’t want big chains, but by the same token—particularly on Cambridge Street—we’ve taken away parking spaces that were valuable to the small businesses that were located there, with no conversation whatsoever about replacing those. As much as I want to see expanded bike lines, I also think it’s important to have a legitimate conversation around, “If you’re taking 100 parking spaces away, what should we do to offset that?”
THC: How do you think the City should or should not preserve Harvard Square’s historical architecture?
JB: We need to restrict the amount of linear space we’re offering to national chain businesses. Bank of America occupies about 90 linear feet of front-line Harvard Square space. And what are they doing with that space? It’s basically a large billboard. It’s not productive in any way, it doesn’t contribute to the community, it doesn’t contribute to the quality of life for Harvard students or to average Cantabrigians. The plan would restrict the amount of space to, I believe, it’s a 30 foot storefront. There’s no prohibition about conducting business, but you can do it in a way that’s not simply a badge or sort of a status symbol for your company: “Oh we have a large storefront on Harvard Square.”
THC: How do you think Cambridge should regulate the use and distribution of recreational marijuana?
JB: Massachusetts residents supported a constitutional amendment, which, I’ve watched the legislature, does not necessarily follow the mandate that was passed by the voters. For the legislature to tinker too much with it causes me concern on representation and some policy grounds. On the other hand, I don’t think it’s inappropriate for the city or the state to have rules around where or how. I would say that while I’m generally in favor of people’s ability to make choices around their own behavior, should the city take some common sense approach about where that consumption takes place, particularly in open spaces, parks, the Square, down the street, I would look at it very carefully and weigh that with the conflicts I’ve voiced here in this conversation.

Dennis J. Carlone, an urban planner and architect, is currently in his second term on the council. Since he was first elected in 2013, he has served as the chairman of the Ordinance Committee and spearheaded the plastic bag ban and the Cambridge Master Plan. Carlone is particularly interested in zoning regulations, noise pollution, campaign finance, and environmental sustainability. Carlone is also one of five candidates for City Council endorsed by Bernie Sanders. Carlone has lived in Cambridge for over forty years. In 1976, he received his Masters from the Harvard Graduate School of Design. 
Editor’s Note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity. 
THE HARVARD CRIMSON: What do you think are the biggest issues facing the Cambridge City Council?
DENNIS J. CARLONE: Well, when I first ran in 2013 there were three issues, and they’re all still very relevant. Obviously affordable housing, which I’m sure you’ve heard about. My children can’t live here once they have kids unless something dramatic changes. That’s been an issue I’ve focused on all along, as soon as I got on, and it’s still a major issue.
Number two is pre-primary education. We’ve moved forward on that, but there’s still 800 people on the waiting list, and that’s just for four year olds. Doesn’t include two and three year olds.
And lastly, and it’s still an issue, the master plan. Cambridge did not have a master plan for fifty years, and I pushed that. And here’s the thing—the state requires every city and town to have a master plan. We somehow avoided that, and here we are in the middle of major development, major change, major traffic, lack of open space—all these issues, and we don’t even have a strategy to tie it all together.  On top of that, it’s environmentalism, with the change in the climate. But I’m the guy who pushed through the plastic bag ban.
THC: What do you think Cambridge should be doing to provide affordable housing for its residents?
DC: We did expand what the developer requirements are from 11.5 percent of the new units to now 20 percent, so we’re about as advanced as any city in the country on that. But here’s the difference, we can’t just rely on developers, we have to use all the other tools.
There’s zoning. Central Square was just rezoned, and the density you could build was increas  if half the new development is housing. There’s no question we should be building affordable housing on the parking lots that the city owns, mostly parking lots.
My background in architecture and urban design taught me how to bring people together, how to understand all the issues and then come up with a scheme or a philosophy that addresses most, if not all, things. Maybe like a 90 percent. You’re never going to solve everything.
THC: Do you think the City Council has done too much to respond to Trump and should focus more on local issues?
DC: Some people focus on Trump. I focus on what’s important to the city. Look, I don’t like the guy, I think he’s stupid. But he’s the president, and if he’s smart he’ll be able to stay in office for four years. And so far, many of the things he tried to do he hasn’t succeeded. So I believe in the system, but I focus on Cambridge.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should balance the need for more bike lanes and concerns from residents who say they take up their parking space?
DC: You probably already know that the number of cars with residential permits in Cambridge has been decreasing. And, in part it’s your generation using more bikes. We have a number of coffees at night where you meet people in neighborhoods. And I would say half the people there say they ride bikes. They were a little younger than me, it wasn’t just people that are in college or grad school. And they loved it. So there’s a creative way to balance this.
THC: How do you think the City should or should not preserve Harvard Square’s historical architecture?
DC: If you look at Harvard Square, actually there are only really a few key buildings, and those should definitely be saved. And then the new developments should fit in and enhance the old buildings. I’m part of the rezoning of Harvard Square that’ll be coming up in November, and part of it says that any new building needs a special permit. So you can build up to 65 feet; if you go over 65 feet in height you need a special permit. And most new buildings will go above that, with a setback—you have to put 50 percent of that in to small, local retail frontage. And this is a way developers will be forced to look for small, unique shops that used to be in Harvard Square when I was here. Harvard Square used to primarily be that, small shops of interesting variety, but now we’re losing that.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should regulate the use and distribution of recreational marijuana?
DC: I just want it in separate spaces. On top of that, I don’t want a storefront, retail. I want it to be more like a doctor’s office, if you will. Medicinal, that’s easy. If there’s medicinal in one place, recreational should be, I don’t know, at least 500, 1,000 feet away. Just so it doesn’t become so dense with activity, but spread it out. And, you know, I’ve been to Amsterdam, I know there are different worlds. It might come to that, but the first shot at it, let’s do it in an intelligent way. A number of towns have refused it. And you probably know that there’s at least five companies that want to open up medicinal here. And we only need three to serve the public. So, I think you’re going to see more and more in the liberal towns, so we have to be careful. I have no problem with it.

A first-time candidate for Cambridge City Council, Olivia D’Ambrosio has a background in professional arts and is running on a platform that places art at the center of public policy. After completing her BA from Amherst College in Theatre and Dance, D’Ambrosio obtained an MFA in Acting from Brown and has studied at Boston University in Arts Administration. Her professional work also focuses on the arts, and she served as an adjunct instructor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Department of Music and Theatre Arts. D’Ambrosio argues that the arts are a key component of Cambridge’s civic identity and that they serve important economic functions in society. 
Apart from the arts, D’Ambrosio is also campaigning to prepare Cambridge for the effects of climate change, advance rights for women and vulnerable communities, and provide affordable housing for Cantabrigians.
The Crimson was unable to schedule an interview with D’Ambrosio by press time.

Jan Devereux, an incumbent running for her second term, has lived in Cambridge since 1993. She was the only non-incumbent elected as councillor in 2015, and currently serves as the chair of the Health & Environment Committee, as well as the Economic Development & University Relations Committee. Her campaign this year draws attention to sustainable urban development and increasing engagement between government officials and their constituents. She was recently endorsed by the Cambridge Residents Alliance and Our Revolution, a political action group spearheaded by Bernie Sanders.
Raised in Florida, she received her BA in English and MBA in Marketing from Princeton and Columbia, respectively. Later, Devereux worked for over ten years in communications and external relationships for school districts, including the Community Charter School of Cambridge. She also led her to co-found the Fresh Pond Alliance, where she formerly served as president. 
THE HARVARD CRIMSON: What do you think are the biggest issues facing Cambridge right now?
JAN DEVEREUX: Housing and general affordability, not just in housing but in cost of living, is a huge concern because—like every part of the country and in metro areas—we have huge and widening inequality. The cost of land is very expensive in Cambridge, therefore the cost of what we build on that land is increasingly expensive, and the demand is increasing.
Another challenge we face as policy makers is how to balance. The growth is inevitable and the growth brings many good things, but the growth also puts a lot of stresses on the community. Not just on the people, but the services, infrastructure, and the environment. So I think planning and continuing to really talk is what will be focused on for at least the next term, probably the next 20 to 30 years.
But for now it’s all ‘go, go, go’ and Cambridge is struggling to figure out what the community mitigation should be. We’ve been holding zoning meetings about the Volpe rezoning. It’s a huge project. It’s something Cambridge has wanted for decades...They’re talking about making a community center. They’re talking about a job connector. At this point we’re still negotiating those. As well as making sure there’s graduate housing, which will help create and open up even more housing across the city.
But at the same time they’re asking for huge upzoning, a lot of density, and we want to make sure the community is getting the best deal possible. So we’ve been talking about everything from the amount of affordable housing to the balance of commercial and residential. We’ve also talked about whether MIT can convert any of these from market use to educational use, which would take it off the tax rolls.
THC: Where do you stand on the preservation of Harvard’s historical architecture?
JD: Maintaining the historical and cultural and architectural character of a city is so important, and if we lose that we lose a lot, so yes obviously I think we should. Obviously the Abbot Building has raised some alarm over that, as has the kiosk. I know in other neighborhoods people want to buy historical houses and replace them with something more contemporary. But I think that will always be a source of debate, but I know there is a new task force to review the Harvard Square conservation district guidelines, and hopefully strengthen the guidelines in the process.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should balance the need for bike infrastructure with existing transportation needs?
JD: I think all safe street and Vision Zero advocates would say there are three pillars that you need to build on. Engineering, which is how you build safe lanes, like on an existing street or with just paint and plastic, like Brattle Street. There is education, which is educating everybody, including those on bikes about what they need to follow, drivers about how to avoid hitting people and opening doors, and pedestrians in changing how we see the road. When you’re behind the car, you see the road differently than you do on a bike, so we need to be conscious of the other people at all times. We need to be thinking, as a driver, what pedestrians are doing and vice versa. We are seeing downturn in single occupancy driving vehicles, and the future is going that way too. We’re close to driverless cars, and people are biking more. What would really help is the state making a bigger investment in transit infrastructure. Hopefully people won’t feel stuck having to drive everywhere. Our streets just aren’t big enough for the number of cars on them, and it can increase still.
THC:Do you think that the City Council has done enough to respond to Trump?
JD: I know a number of candidates have said in forums that the very reason they’re running for office is because of Donald Trump. I think it has woken up a lot of people and hopefully a greater number of people will turn out to vote in the local election and do their research, attend forums, and make an informed choice. I don’t think many people running, or in Cambridge really, who aren’t against Donald Trump, so I think continuing to pass what are mostly symbolic resolutions doesn’t do much. In terms of what we can do, we can continue to express everything from opposition to disgust to many of his policies and how he conducts himself. It’s appalling, I think, but I just don’t know if we can, as a body, do much. We can’t solve the healthcare problem, but we can be aggressive in our own approach to climate change and remaining a sanctuary city and protecting undocumented immigrants.
I think some people have decided that, since they feel relatively powerless under this federal administration, I think it’s good to focus on the local because at least they feel they can have an impact. I hope people are organizing a strong resistance to put forward candidates who can take back important offices in congress and the White House. If anyone has an interest in being involved in any way, there’s plenty of opportunity now. Hopefully after this campaign, people will shift their energy to the national level.

Gebru currently serves as Managing Director of Black Lion Strategies, a consulting firm focused on U.S.-Ethiopian relations, and is on the board of the Cambridge Community Center. His platform focuses on “building an inclusive Cambridge” by prioritizing social mobility, which he believes can be achieved by creating affordable housing and reducing economic inequality.
Editor’s Note: this interview has been edited for length and clarity.
THE HARVARD CRIMSON: What do you think are the biggest issues facing the Cambridge City Council right now?
SAMUEL GEBRU: My platform is about economic inequality and affordable housing. I believe that those are the biggest issues. I'm committed to building an inclusive Cambridge, and I think we can do that by prioritizing social mobility on the City Council. So that means providing all of our residents with the access, opportunities, and resources that they need to be successful. I don't think you can ever guarantee equal outcomes in life, but as long as you're able to provide people with an equal footing, that's the role of municipal government, in my perspective. If we are able to do the daily maintenance work of a City Council—our roads, our bridges, our water supply, our trees, our parks—but beyond that, if we're able to provide people with opportunities for social and economic mobility and affordable housing options, then I think we've done our job.
THC: A major focus of your campaign is affordable housing; what do you think Cambridge should be doing to provide this affordable housing to its residents?
SG: I argue that we need to be building more housing. That's one thing that we haven't been doing, but it's a critical function of the City Council. I think, right now, the way you need to see it—and it's basic economics—there's a limited supply of housing. There are rental units in Cambridge now that are being occupied by people who have the ability to pay higher than what the market value is, just because they want to live in Cambridge, and they can afford to live in Cambridge. When I was in high school, more and more of my classmates were getting priced out of Cambridge every year, and I think that's unacceptable. What I would like to do is build more housing for all types of incomes. If you build more housing, and you increase the supply, especially around mass transit, I think we'll be able to solve this problem. The other thing is also making sure that, not only is the housing transit-oriented, but also that we're increasing options for homeownership. I think we can significantly enhance the first-time homebuyer program in Cambridge and make sure that we're providing more pathways to prosperity for our residents. Rental units are very important; two thirds of our city rents, and so we need to definitely increase the amount of rental units, but also, to the extent that we can, to also increase the number of homeownership units.
THC: Do you think Cambridge should respond to President Donald Trump's policies?
SG: Some of them that relate to our city, yeah. As much uncertainty there is and as much volatility there is in our national politics, we need to be able to tune that out and focus on Cambridge. I think it's been difficult for Cambridge because trying to stay on task is such a hard thing, especially when your residents feel threatened by Donald Trump. A lot of the work that Cambridge has been doing is just trying to reassure residents that all hell is not going to break loose in Cambridge. And that's a difficult thing to do. I would love to see us stay on message as much as we can while also reassuring our residents that the City is here for them.
THC: How do you think the City should or should not preserve Harvard Square's historical character?
SG: I think ultimately, when it comes to the future of Harvard Square, we're going to find a need to support and help small businesses to maintain their presence. It would be a real shame if we lost that character. The other thing that you have to remember is the entire Harvard Square area, and that whole area of Mid-Cambridge, is a historical district. There's not much you can do in terms of destroying the facade of these buildings, which also gives me a lot of comfort, knowing that Harvard Square will always retain some sort of historical and unique nature. No matter if there's a shopping mall that's coming into the Abbot Building, the facade will always remain architecturally the same as it always has been.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should balance the need for more bike lanes and concerns from residents who say they take up their parking spaces?
SG: I think we need to come up with an inclusive process that involves all stakeholders to ensure that we are providing safe streets for drivers, bicyclists, and pedestrians. It's possible, and we've done it before; I like to cite Western Ave. as an example. I live in that neighborhood, and Western Ave. is a beautiful example of a safe street design for bicyclists, drivers, and pedestrians. You know, I think the bike lanes that we put up in other parts of the city, while well-intentioned, were not as inclusive as we thought they were, and there's been a lot of backlash.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should regulate the use and distribution of recreational marijuana?
SG: I have very liberal views on it. I don't think we should be regulating it at all. It's a shame that it had to go to a ballot initiative last year, but it did. And I think right now it's just a matter of implementing it. I would like us to find spots to zone in recreational marijuana stores. I understand the concern from some residents that they don't want it near schools, they don't want it near hospitals. And those I agree with. But I think in certain areas, like Central Square, they are doable.
THC: Why should Cantabrigians vote for you over other candidates?
SG: I'm a 25-year-old who got my start in eighth grade, and I've worked on four election campaigns. Despite my relative age, being young, I do bring that level of experience with me, and the level of familiarity with Cambridge. If candidates or voters are looking at me, I hope that they're looking for a candidate who prioritizes economic inequality and affordable housing, who is committed to the values of economic justice, making sure that everyone has a fair shot. I’m also someone who has the lived experience of having been raised in Cambridge, who brings experience of organizing, bringing people together from different backgrounds, and who knows how to get things done.

A lifelong Cantabrigian, Richard Harding Jr., currently serves on the Cambridge School Committee and is running for City Council for the first time. Prior to serving on the school committee, Harding began his career as an intern at Citizen’s Energy, a non-profit that brings heating oil to homes of elderly Massachusetts residents. He has worked as Director of Constituent Services for former Massachusetts Senator Steven Tolman, and Chair of the Ward 2 Democratic Committee. He also serves as Vice President of Cambridge’s NAACP chapter. Harding’s campaign platform proposes creating affordable family-friendly housing, increasing the quality of public education, addressing the growing opioid crisis, and decreasing gaps in economic inequality.
Editor’s note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
THE HARVARD CRIMSON: What do you think are the biggest issues facing the Cambridge City Council?
RICHARD HARDING, JR.: I think that the issues of affordability within the city, affordable housing, affordable child care and universal pre-K, the income inequality that is blatant here in Cambridge, to some degree where you don’t see it in other places. I think Cambridge is the greatest place to live, work, raise a family, and go to school, but we are not immune to the other issues that are happening around us both globally, nationally, and locally. For me, it’s about making sure that Cambridge allows everybody to strive and thrive in a city that can only be as great as its most vulnerable person.
THC: Why should Cantabrigians vote for you over other candidates?
RH: I think I’m uniquely situated to connect people like myself, the people who were born and raised here and who have made this city great, with the people who have come here to study or to work or to raise a family or whatever the case may be. People want to come here, and rightfully so, and I think there has to be a particular balance in ideas and how we communicate and respect each other as citizens and use our collective will to make sure the city is working for all of us.
THC: What do you think Cambridge should be doing to provide affordable housing for its residents?
RH: I think a few different approaches that we could take would be appropriate. Some of them more looking at what we can do through zoning and making sure that we’re entertaining development projects that are committed to affordable family-friendly housing versus a lot of big luxury buildings. I think we need to look at some particular creative tax credits that we are giving developers to build here. I think we also have to think about what we call affordable. Cambridge has a unique problem—it’s too unaffordable to rent and too unaffordable to purchase a home here in Cambridge, so we need to figure out creative ways to fix that.
THC: How do you think Harvard and other universities within Cambridge should work with the city to help this housing crisis?
RH: I don’t think they’re doing enough. I think that it’s a shame that Harvard only gives the city so little bit of resources towards affordable housing and other programs. You also have to figure out a way to house your own students. That takes away from the pressures on the housing market. There’s no doubt that in our school system, in some of our human service programs, and even in some of our planning that Harvard could use its talent and treasure to help us.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should respond to President Donald Trump’s policies?
RH: I think that we are in some of the most trying times that I have seen in my life. The rhetoric, the policies, the temperament, and the lack of competence that is on display at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. is inexcusable and sad in a way that words can’t describe. And for me, my biggest issue here is to send to the voters in Cambridge that this is a clear example of why elections matter. I think Cambridge is a strong enough community to survive. We are so invested in our values that we will live long after Donald Trump’s regime leaves the White House.
THC: Do you think that the City Council has done enough to respond to Trump?
RH: From what I know there’s been a pretty good attempt to send a message to Washington. I think that we could always do more. I think think that there’s always an opportunity to continue to be consistent about sending a message, about the community that we are and our values and I think we should, whenever we can, send that message to Washington through whatever, by any and all means necessary.
Many of the things we have done at this point have been symbolic. I think that we should focus though as much as we can on the issues that, when citizens of Cambridge wake up tomorrow, will be front and center in their lives like housing, the income inequality, the growing opioid crisis, public education, the lack of diversity in a lot of our hiring, and the situation we have around poverty and homelessness.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should balance the need for more bike lanes and concerns from residents who say they take up parking space?
RH: There are way more cars than bikes. I don’t say that because I’m anti-bike—because I’m not—and I’m not anti-pedestrian. But the truth is, where they’ve done some of these projects, particularly the protected bike lanes, it’s been a horrible planning process and no one’s been held accountable. I think that the narrative has been set up to pit the people who are pro-bike lane against the people who are perceived as being anti-bike lane. There has to be a balance. There has to be good planning.
THC: How do you think the City should or should not preserve Harvard Square’s historical architecture?
RH: We should do all we can, once again, to preserve the authenticity of Harvard Square and the small business nature that it always was.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should regulate the use and distribution of recreational marijuana?
RH: I think they should follow the law that was passed. I would agree with having more education to make people aware and understand the facts about marijuana. The voters spoke and they spoke loudly on this law, so I think that the city has to do what it can within its powers to evolve around the change of conscious or change of attitude around recreational marijuana and see to it that we adhere with the laws as much as we can.

Craig Kelley, incumbent chair of the Cambridge City Council’s Public Safety Subcommittee, has served on the Council since 2005 and is running for reelection on a platform to increase affordable housing options and fighting climate change within Cambridge. A graduate from the Harvard Kennedy School, Kelley is actively involved in supporting bike safety efforts, creating arts opportunities in Cambridge public schools, and environmental protection. Kelley lives in Cambridge with his wife and two sons.
Editor’s note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
THE HARVARD CRIMSON: What do you think are the biggest issues facing the Cambridge City Council?
CRAIG KELLEY: There are a number of very, very big issues: whether it’s our ability to house people in a way that’s affordable, whether it’s our ability to educate adults and children in a way that prepares them for success in the twenty-first century, whether it’s our ability to look at the emerging delivery economy of Uber and Lyft and Amazon and so forth, and figure out how it fits into our crowded streets, whether it’s our ability to look at transportation opportunities and challenges of the future like one-wheels and electric bikes and the booming number of cyclists. All these things are very big issues, but overlying all of them is the challenge the Council has in working as an effective legislative body to tackle them, to communicate honestly, to disagree aggressively but respectfully, build some sort of collaborative effort on these things as appropriate, and then move on to the next problem. The biggest issue is making the Council work like a problem-solving body with city staff and with the public as well as with each other.
THC: Why should people in Cambridge vote for you over other candidates?
CK: Because I look at the future. And I see something that does not reflect the past in any really, really definitive way. We’re going to face challenges that are going to transform how we live as individuals, how we function as a city. And for us to meet that transformation most effectively, we need Councillors who understand we’re not bound by thoughts of the past. The City of Cambridge has been around for a long time, and there’s an immense amount of value in that legacy, but we can’t look back to 1987 and think that’s the future of Cambridge, because it’s not. So we need Councillors like myself who understand that the past is a guide, but it is increasingly a loose guide. It’s that collaborative part, and the clear vision that the future is going to be very distinctly different from the past, that I bring that other people, I think, don’t have quite at the same level as I do.
THC: How do you think Harvard and other Cambridge universities should work with the city to help create affordable housing options?
CK: The people of Cambridge need to understand that housing more people in Cambridge requires a denser city. We may or may not want that, but we’re not going to be able to house more people here without more housing. I look to Harvard and MIT as being important players in the regionalization discussion. Both of these institutions have the power of their name—when the president of Harvard or the president of MIT says, “we really want to work on a regional solution to A, B, C, or D,” people will pay attention to that in a way that they won’t when Craig Kelley says that, because Harvard as an institution has been around for hundreds of years. Universities worldwide are some of the longest-lasting institutions there are. So that’s where Harvard and MIT are not doing as well as they should be doing. And part of that is because Councils like the Cambridge City Council are not yet figuring out that the future is going to be a future of vastly different challenges and opportunities than the past. How we bring the universities to meet the challenges, take advantage of the opportunities, is going to have to be a new discussion.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should respond to President Donald Trump’s policies?
CK: We are a sanctuary city, which means that we don’t enforce federal immigration law. And to the extent that federal law preempts us, that’s the rules of the game, just like state law preempts us. The response is one of inclusion and one of mutual support and one of love for each other, but it’s not one of being able to ignore national law. I think it’s important for people in Cambridge and politicians in Cambridge to understand what we have the authority and power to do, zoning, for example, within limits of the constitution, and what we don’t. We can and do offer support in terms of Council orders and positions that say we oppose the president on DACA and we support immigrant rights, and those are important statements.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should balance the need for more bike lanes and concerns from residents who say they take up their parking space?
CK: It’s all about bike safety. I do nothing but bike and my family does nothing but bike because we don’t have a car. There is no one more invested in bike safety than I am. The challenge is proving that these bike lanes are safe, and the two latest collisions that I know about both involved some of the City’s new lanes. It’s not at all clear to me how the City is evaluating the safety of the lanes that it has put in. We can’t add cyclist safety and endanger pedestrian safety, so what’s going to be safer for both of those groups? And when that happens, I’m good. If it takes away parking, it takes away parking. But that’s not the question. The question is, “Is the world safer?”
THC: How do you think Cambridge should regulate the use and distribution of recreational marijuana?
CK: It’s illegal to smoke marijuana in public. We are struggling to figure out what that means, because people are smoking it all over, and I’m regularly having people complain to me that they can’t go anywhere without someone lighting up near them and making the air less enjoyable to breathe. It’s not something most of us want to criminalize. It’s not something the police want to get stuck enforcing, and the optics of a lot of police enforcement stuff can be really, really bad; the cops don’t want to be arresting someone for smoking marijuana without the general public saying that’s what they want. I don’t think the general public’s there.

A Cambridge resident for nearly 50 years, Dan Lenke has worked as a home contractor and owner and manager of a moving company, in addition to launching a food co-op in Cambridge. One of Lenke’s biggest concerns is protecting Cantabrigians from being forced out of the city by unaffordable housing. His platform calls for regulating development in Cambridge, pushing for a Cambridge-specific car service to decrease traffic, and increasing the efficiency of Cambridge’s internet by making it a public utility. Lenke raised his three children in Cambridge, and now has four grandchildren.
Editor’s note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
THE HARVARD CRIMSON: What do you think are the most important issues facing the Cambridge City Council?
DAN LENKE: I feel that the Council’s objective must be to make Cambridge for Cantabrigians. They’re being forced out. By the hundreds, by the thousands. I can see all that’s valuable in life is people. And that means nothing if we don’t respect people. And that’s the job of the City Council: to work with each other, because we’re different, and to work with all the resources of the city, of which there are multiple, and to work with universities, and to learn from other cities. To see that the people in the city are well-served. Number one is that they don’t get kicked out for a different scheme, which excludes the value of natural social nurturing.
THC: Are you working with any other candidates, formally or informally, during the campaign?
DL: I would like to, but I haven’t taken the time—and none of the others seem to have a moment. We’re all fully out to try to work this campaign. But I certainly will if elected. I absolutely will ask every other current candidate now, to work with me, to make this a better city, as they have all brought themselves forward to do, with their wonderful, unique, capacities and insights. But there’s a question you might ask—I just said I didn’t find time to interact with the other candidates, as I would like to, so how am I going to do that in the future when I’m five times as busy? I’m going to ask people in the city to work with other people. I’m even going to dedicate a portion of my salary to hiring Cantabrigians to work toward common goals, among them will be communication, listening, interacting, getting things done. There are many wonderful, competent, alert people in Cambridge, who want to see a change, and who need to see a change, but who haven’t connected with a city councillor, who is somebody who can facilitate that. So I would be able to connect them and follow up. I’ll bring them together, so we can do anything. If I show other people, if I give them permission, yes, we can do this.
THC: Why should Cantabrigians vote for you over other candidates?
DL: They shouldn’t vote for me over other candidates. They should vote for me because they will be surprisingly, properly, and fully rewarded for doing so, by the effectiveness that I will daily bring about.
THC: What do you think Cambridge should be doing to provide affordable housing to its residents?
DL: That’s a term that’s miscast and misconstrued: affordable. Let’s break down affordable. Affordable to whom? To the working people? People who do not have a college education are being squeezed out of Cambridge almost as quickly as can be counted. The people who lived here for generations are gone and are leaving. They can’t afford it. We have no plan in Cambridge to actually bring about affordable housing. We have plans that intend toward that, such as 20 percent affordable housing in new buildings. But the rents called affordable are not, to the working people. And they may not be distributed as we wish them to be. There are hundreds, if not thousands, who are waiting for housing, who will never get it in Cambridge. Places that are just blocks of housing, they’re not pleasant to live in. In Cambridge right now, we have a number of housing projects, like Roosevelt Towers. It’s not pleasant to live in. It’s affordable, in fact, it’s subsidized, but it’s not a happy place to live. So what we’re offering is not what we say we’re offering. We’re losing our diversity in Cambridge. When we have different people, it’s better.
THC: What should Cambridge do to fix that?
DL: First, we recognize that there is a problem. The first order of business is for the Council to determine exactly what we’re going to do.  And throw various ventures that may be potentially beneficial, like the 20 percent affordable housing proposal. If we analyze, we see that it will not keep the people here that are living here. It can’t do it. Or raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour. Everyone’s on board with that, including yours truly. But $15 an hour is not enough to live in Cambridge. I suggested we take a census, at the last forum, of all the people who are at risk in Cambridge, because they’re all people. If we don’t define, identify each person who’s living in Cambridge, we won’t be able to help them.

Ilan Levy, who is running for City Council for a second time, has lived in Cambridge for the last 14 years working as a software engineer. For the past decade, Levy has been involved in local activism, inspiring him to seek a spot on the Cambridge City Council. He is pushing to implement a system in which Cambridge residents have a more direct stake in local politics. Levy has served on the East Cambridge Planning Team and ran a blog about local issues.
Editor’s Note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity. 
THE HARVARD CRIMSON: What do you think are the biggest issues facing the Cambridge City Council?
ILAN LEVY: The biggest issue facing Cambridge is its form of government. I think that before we resolve the issue of how we govern ourselves, we cannot address the big issues that are facing Cambridge and cannot implement them in the current system of charter planning.
THC: Why should Cantabrigians vote for you over other candidates?
IL: Because I'm the only one that speaks to the one issue that is essential, which is the way we govern ourselves. The basic idea is that because Cambridge has a city manager-led, corporate form of government. We have to prioritize revenue because the job of the city manager is to generate revenue for the city. Therefore, it's systematically laid out that the only priorities that we can have are financial, and as long as we don't bring back the community at the center of the decision-making process, we cannot really address the issues that are being discussed during the campaign.
THC: What do you think Cambridge should be doing to provide affordable housing for its residents?
IL: It should change its form of government so that we can decide together what our common objective is going to be. My proposal, and the basis of the conversation that I want to have, is on what local democracy should be for the 21st century. I want to have an accountable form of local government, and this discussion should be underpinned by four fundamental principles: We should have publicly financed campaigns, we should have term limits for all elected positions, we should have the election of a strong mayor with a vision and a plan, and no two public jobs should be held at the same time. Relevant to the housing question is the fact that we should elect the direction that we are going to take as a city. Right now, because of our prioritization of revenue through the City Council, we have only very limited powers to incentify diversification of housing. If we elected a city mayor, we would have an actual decision to make on what type of a plan we want to achieve for affordable housing.
THC: How do you think Harvard and other Cambridge universities should work with the city to help the housing situation?
IL: They should be much more engaged, but they don't have any means to get engaged with the city. Again, it comes back to the same issues over and over again. We have a systemic infrastructure that doesn't allow for the type of communication that we would envision with the University in order to solve a common problem together. Not only are we dealing with the University and the city trying to implement a project forward, but it's also the reverse. How can the students help the actual community make a difference? So, it's that communication between University and city from which could emanate better solutions.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should respond to President Donald Trump’s policies?
IL: Let me put it this way, I don't want to engage in any of the Trump policy, but I don't also want to give him any platform to further his discourse or inflammatory conversations, and I'd rather actually bypass talking about him altogether.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should balance the need for more bike lanes and concerns from residents who say they take up their parking space?
IL: How is it that in a very progressive city like Cambridge we don't have a plan for bike lanes? How come it turns out that it took the death of two bicyclists last year for us to come out and suddenly implement a protected bike lane on Cambridge streets and create, by the instantaneous and rapidity of the reaction, a lot of division because there was no proper information? I am a biker, I bike everywhere I go, and protected bike lanes make me safe and I ride much slower and much less aggressively when I know I am in a protected bike lane. An example is what happens on Western Ave., by the Cambridge port, where they have a beautiful infrastructure that accommodates all modes of transportation. We need to be multi-mobile, we need to be a 21st century city. We are far from it because our infrastructure at the government level doesn't allow us to go in that direction.
THC: How do you think the City should or should not preserve Harvard Square’s historical architecture?
IL: I think it seems pretty obvious that it should be kept. One of the things that was a lot of fun during this campaign is that I became very much more embedded within the long-term community in Cambridge. By embedding myself in that fashion, you start discovering much more of the history of the neighborhoods and what makes them special. You learn the buildings and the institutions are that each neighborhood tends to really appreciate, because for them it has a historical significance. I think it's pretty fundamental that when we build for the future, we make we sure we are conscious of the present and the past, and that we integrate that into our daily background. It tells us about where we were, where we are now, and where we are going.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should regulate the use and distribution of recreational marijuana?
IL: Marijuana is a fairly benign drug in all contexts. I think that we should obviously have the same regulation—nothing less—than what we do for alcohol, but I have a tendency to not understand why we are so much stricter on the topic of marijuana, when we allow alcohol to be sold and tobacco to be sold so freely, and they have caused much much more damage than other recreational drugs.

A fourth-generation Cambridge resident running for his third term on the Council, Marc McGovern currently serves as Vice Mayor for the city. McGovern cites providing more affordable housing, combatting poverty, and working towards economic justice as the most pressing issues facing Cambridge. On the Council, McGovern leads the Finance, Human Services and Veterans, Civic Unity, and Housing Committees. Before his time on the City Council, McGovern served four terms on the Cambridge School Committee and was a social worker. If re-elected, McGovern says he hopes to encourage more city property acquisitions and navigate the changing politics of President Donald Trump's administration in order to best serve Cambridge's most vulnerable residents. 
THE HARVARD CRIMSON: What are some of the biggest issues facing the Cambridge City Council?
MARC MCGOVERN: Affordable housing is a top issue facing the city. We also have a lot of folks in our city, low-income and middle-income folks, who are really struggling, not just with housing, but paying for childcare and just the high cost of living here in Cambridge. Cambridge actually has a higher poverty rate than the state average; this is something people don’t know. So I would say issues surrounding affordable housing, economic justice, are probably the biggest issues facing our city right now; that includes everything from poverty to opioid addiction.
THC: What do you think that Cambridge should do to help provide more affordable housing to its residents? Are there any particular programs that you might think would be helpful?
MM: I was co-chair of the housing committee with Mayor E. Denise Simmons, and we just took the lead on raising the inclusionary zoning percentage to 20 percent, which is going to yield hundreds and hundreds of units of housing. We also tripled the linkage fee, which is amount of money that commercial developers have to pay to city that we then use to preserve and create affordable housing. Mayor Simmons and I did that.
Moving forward, I think the city’s inclusionary zoning isn’t going to solve the problem tomorrow. Something the city needs to continue to do is be more aggressive in obtaining property. When property is purchased by a for-profit developer, there’s only certain things that the city can do; but when the city owns the property, we have much more flexibility. We have to continue to acquire property, which is difficult in the city. We also have to preserve affordable housing. We have a number of affordable housing developments that in the next few years could be losing their affordability status because the agreements that keep them affordable are ending.
There are people running for Council that think that if you don’t build any housing, people will stop moving here, and I think that’s not correct. People want to live in Cambridge. It’s a very desirable place to live, because of our jobs and our schools and our low crime rate, and our reputation—all the reasons people love it here.
THC: Moving to national politics, how do you think that Cambridge should respond to President Donald Trump’s policies, in the last few months and going forward?
MM: Well, I’ve done a lot of work on this. One of the first things I did after the election was to file a policy order rededicating Cambridge as a sanctuary city. I was not going to let Trump bully us into walking away from our values. And in that order, I also asked the City Manager to start planning for any funding cuts that might come our way from the administration. So we’re already trying to strategize how we maintain the level of service if Trump carries through with many of the promises he’s been making.
THC: How do you think that Cambridge should balance the need for more bike lanes and concerns from residents who think that those bike lanes are taking up more parking space on the roads?
MM: Here's what I say to people: Bikes aren’t going anywhere. Cars aren’t going anywhere. Pedestrians aren’t going anywhere. And our roads were not built for the volume or the multiple modes of transportation that we see in use. And so everybody's going to have to sacrifice. I’ve said to bike supporters: you’re not going to get a bike lane on every street. But we should create a network of bike lanes that allow cyclists to get around the community safely. To people who are concerned about parking, I say: you’re going to lose parking because our streets need to be safe for everybody. Cars don’t own the streets. We need to think differently about how we share our streets. And it goes for everybody. Drivers break the rules, pedestrians break the rules, cyclists break the rules. We all have an impact. We need more education, we have to be more patient with each other, and we have to understand that there are limitations in what we can do if we’re going to make our streets safer. Everybody has to be part of that solution.
THC: How do you think that Cambridge should regulate the use and distribution of recreational marijuana, especially in light of its recent legalization at the state level?
MM: I wrote the ordinance around medical marijuana for Cambridge. And I think that we really need to see the regulations the state’s going to put in place, and then how do we work with those. So for example, a medical marijuana dispensary can’t be within 500 feet of any place that children congregate. Now in Cambridge, we have so many small parks, so many playgrounds, so many schools, that really limits the places where a medical marijuana dispensary could open. I mean, you can’t throw a tennis ball without hitting a playground or a school in this city. So if the state comes down with similar kinds of guidelines, that’s going to limit what we can do. We want to create zoning where we have opportunity for non-medical marijuana shops to open in Cambridge, but I'm not sure I want them lining Mass. Ave. either. It’s a little tough to say at this point, because I want to be thoughtful about it. Until we get recommendations from the state, it’ll be hard for us to say what the limitations will be.
I think both questions—medical marijuana and recreational marijuana—passed overwhelmingly in Cambridge. I think it's something that the residents have spoken about, that it’s something they support, and I think we should follow through with that.

A City Council candidate in every election since 2007, Gregg Moree touts his lifelong ties to Cambridge and his Democratic family background as his reasons for repeatedly running. Moree, a carpenter by trade, says that as a Councillor, he would want to have dinner with President Donald Trump and fight to increase the number of affordable housing units available in Cambridge.
Editor’s note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
The Harvard Crimson: What do you think are the biggest issues facing the Cambridge City Council right now?
Greg Moree: It’s jobs and housing, jobs and housing. Internships, youth apprenticeship programs. We need to get these kids off the street. This is a community, we’re supposed to look out for each other. We don’t want anybody to fall through the cracks. There are people cut out to go to Harvard and MIT, and then there are people cut out just to go to work as a cop or a plumber, an electrician. And internships.
THC: What do you think Cambridge should be doing about its affordable housing crisis?
GM: I think they should build affordable housing all over the city of Cambridge. And I understand that the developers need to make a profit, so if the building needs to go a little bit more higher up, then let it go up a little bit more higher. This is a campus city, this is a bike city. People are going to want to walk around this city, and they need to use their bikes more often, and less automobiles.
THC: Why are you prepared to solve these problems?
GM: I have a hundred year history here in the city of Cambridge. I spent my whole life being honest, being a good neighbor, and telling the truth. And those things matter. And it’s just common sense solutions in the city of Cambridge. We’re going to sit down and talk about the issues, and come up with a good resolution.
THC: Do you think the City Council has done enough to respond to President Donald Trump’s policies or would you go further?
GM: I think it’s better to work with him than fight with him. It’s better to have some type of dialogue with him, to have a conversation. I’d like to have dinner with him–Gregg Moree would like to invite Donald Trump to the Kennedy School of Government to discuss issues, in a bipartisan way. That’s why the Kennedy School is there, to talk about issues that we care about. So we can bring everybody together at the Kennedy School of Government, and let them know that we care about health insurance, we care about our diversity here in Cambridge. Please, Mr. President, protect our youth, protect our people. I believe he’s gonna do that. I actually believe he’s gonna do it, but we need to invite him here to have a dialogue here.
THC: Are there any policies that you believe the Cambridge City government should be putting in place in response to Trump’s policies?
GM: Well, I listen to the attorney general, Maura Healey. She’s the one that can do all that stuff. She files lawsuits, and she cares about that stuff. So that’s an area that whatever she does I’m gonna do, cause she’s the attorney general.
THC: Back to more local issues, how do you think Cambridge should balance the need for more bike lanes and concerns from residents who do say that they need more parking spaces?
GM: Well, we should have a study, and we have pros and cons to the issue. Do I favor bike lanes and bike safety? Yes. Do I want to stop jaywalking? Yes. But what about these bikes going through intersections and stuff? This is a congested city, there are a lot of complex issues that we have to work on. I’m in favor of all good resolutions.
THC: Where do you stand on the preservation of Harvard’s historical architecture?
GM: I stand with the communities. I stand with the universities, and the citizens of this community and the commonwealth of Massachusetts. That’s where the city council’s supposed to be there. It’s going along so we can get along.
THC: How should Cambridge regulate the use and distribution of recreational marijuana?
GM: Well, the kids should be doing their homework, not smoking pot in Harvard Square, you know? I don’t favor marijuana. The kids basically should just do their homework, not think about getting high.
THC: What are your thoughts on medical marijuana?
GM: Well, medical marijuana, for people who have cancer and all that—I think I can agree to that, you know. Medical marijuana, with doctor’s prescriptions, I can support that.

Editor’s note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
THE HARVARD CRIMSON: What do you think are the biggest issues facing the Cambridge City Council?
ADRIANE MUSGRAVE: It's probably no surprise to you affordable housing is the bigger issue that everyone is talking about and it's been this way for a really long time. I think the three things that I talk a lot about are we need to look all across the city and strategically add density where possible. You know, as density is diversity and the opportunity of living in our city is so high, and so we need a citywide affordable housing overlay. We need to explore property tax reduction for residents who offer below-market rates and explore the use of our parking lots for middle income housing. We need to take a good hard look at our zoning code to reform it so that it's more equitable for our affordable housing groups.
I think we should explore ways to use property tax credit for homeowners who would offer either rooms or housing units at below-market rates as a way to incentivize individuals to bring more housing on the market.
THC: Why should Cantabrigians vote for you over other candidates?
AM: I think of all the new candidates I have the strongest grasp of where we are and the challenges of the issues we're working with. And I worked really hard to make sure that when elected, I can hit the ground running. I’m on the board of a national economic development nonprofit called Interise. We're headquartered in Boston and we work in over 75 communities across the country and we work with small business owners to get them the tools to succeed to grow their business. It's a really innovative way of addressing poverty and inequality and through my work on the executive board of this organization I've come to really understand the levers that we have in order to help families build family financial stability, which is so crucial here in Cambridge. A lot of folks don't realize that we have 18 percent of our kids and nearly 40 percent of our single moms living in poverty. And so there are many things that we should be doing to make sure that everyone at Cambridge has access to economic opportunity. And that's the core part of my platform and is quite frankly something not a lot of the candidates are really talking about and I have a unique perspective and experience to bring to help.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should respond to President Donald Trump’s policies?
AM: Here in Cambridge we will fight really hard to maintain the values and the culture that we believe in and that we care about here. And so we have worked very hard to maintain our status as a sanctuary city because it was decided by the Supreme Court that they're not allowed to take away funds because of our sanctuary city status. We've worked very hard to find creative legal ways to establish funding for DACA. And it's not just Trump, it’s the full Republican Congress. So earlier this month the Republican Congress let the child health insurance program expire. This is a program that serves tens of millions of children all across the country in making sure that children and lower-income families have access to primary care and preventive health. Here in Massachusetts, our funding will run out by March of next year. Again, when we have 18 percent of our kids here in Cambridge who are in poverty and using those programs, it’s important for the next City Council to figure out and think about these funding mechanisms and think about the kind of federal programs that our residents are benefiting from.
That said,  I think there's a risk actually of focusing too much on national issues. Quite frankly I think we have been talking about universal early childhood education—you know, Pre-K for all—for a really long time and we haven't made a lot of progress on that. We don't need to wait on the federal government to do that; we can do that here in Cambridge.
THC: Back to more local issues, how do you think Cambridge should balance the need for more bike lanes and concerns from residents who say the lanes take up their parking space?
AM: I am a long time bike commuter and road cyclist and I am thrilled with the bike infrastructure that we’ve put in place. Adding in bike lanes makes it safer for cyclists, it makes it safer for pedestrians, and it makes it safer for drivers here in the city. I think we need to continue to keep in mind that we have lots of different people in our city and lots of different uses for a streets. I think we need to continue to keep in mind that we have lots of different people in our city and lots of different uses for a streets. Figuring out how to integrate all of these things is something that I think we should continue to work on but it doesn't mean that we should stop adding bike lanes throughout the city.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should regulate the use and distribution of recreational marijuana?


AM: In Cambridge we already have a medicinal marijuana shop. Not many communities have that, not many communities have a needle exchange. Again forward-thinking public health and forward-thinking sort of community needs or wants is something that I think we do pretty well at. So I'd like to see it possible here in Cambridge—I don't think we should exclude it, I also don't think we wanted to become ever-present all throughout the city.

Nadya Okamoto ’20 is not your typical candidate for City Council. A Harvard College sophomore who moved to Cambridge from Portland, Ore. her freshmen year of high school, Okamoto built a women’s health non-profit called PERIOD. that provides feminine hygiene products to low-income women . Her age has helped her garner national and regional media attention as she tries to become the youngest member of the City Council.
Editor’s Note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity. 
THE HARVARD CRIMSON: What do you think are the biggest issues facing the Cambridge City Council?
NADYA OKAMOTO: Housing affordability, and a lack of a climate change preparedness plan. City Council’s done a lot of work in identifying what severe risk we’re at. But there’s no movement on green infrastructure, and making sure that we’re ready for that.
But first and foremost, it’s economic diversity, and there’s just so many families that are being priced out of Cambridge right now because they can’t afford to live here. My top priority would be to preserving economic diversity.
THC: Why should Cantabrigians vote for you over other candidates?
NO: What’s unique to me is that almost every candidate is saying that our top priority is housing affordability and allowing people to live in their homes, who are fighting against housing instability.
But I’m actually the only candidate that’s experienced housing instability, and I think the lack of understanding for that experience is causing harm to a lot of policies.
Also, I would be representing a whole demographic that has never had a seat on the Council before. We’ve never had student representation on the Council. I would be this unprecedented voice for what has never been represented on the Council before.
THC: How do you think Harvard and other Cambridge universities should work with the city to help the housing situation?
NO: Cambridge has an affordable housing trust, but there’s a lot that we can be doing not only to grow that. We could also use the affordable housing trust and actually build housing for the purpose of affordable housing. We could also build mixed income housing for the middle class and beyond that as well.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should respond to President Donald Trump’s policies?
NO: It’s more and more of a question of climate change. It makes me so mad. But now, what we do with climate change is up to the city, not up to the federal government, because the federal government is not acknowledging climate change. In addition to that, with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and being a sanctuary city, there’s these like threats if we were to continue being a sanctuary city. And people are saying that’s not possible anymore, but the idea that could happen, the city has to be prepared for that. And I think we are.
THC: Do you think that the City Council has done enough to respond to Trump?
NO: I think we could always be doing more. I think Cambridge has done a great job of standing up and being a sanctuary city, but there’s more that we can be doing with all the universities, what we could be doing about Title IX, and protecting all the students there. What we could be doing about climate change. Cambridge is not a leader in climate change. At all. And it can be. The other thing I’m focusing on at the top of my platform is education equity, so access to the technology to equal the playing field. And more sustainable living which means climate change preparedness, but also safer streets for residents and more benches for the senior citizens, and more protected bike lanes where appropriate, that kind of thing.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should balance the need for more bike lanes and concerns from residents who say they take up their parking space?
NO: People get very heated about this. There’s just a lack of transparency and involvement of the community in the planning process right now. I really want to somehow implement a digital system or a way for constituents to check in and know exactly what to expect in terms of bike lanes coming up, where to give feedback to it. Because I think what’s happening right now is that constituents feel like they don’t have a say in where the bike lanes are going. So, there are places where there are more bike lanes are needed, and places where there aren’t more bike lanes needed, so constituents think it’s actually more dangerous to add more bike lanes in certain areas. We need to prioritize building bike lanes where constituents actually want them.
THC: How do you think the City should or should not preserve Harvard Square’s historical architecture?
NO: It should. I think it has a responsibility to. The city can do it, because the city is in charge of zoning. I think the magic of the Harvard Square, this is where the students get really amped up too, because we all love Harvard Square because we can walk to Felipe’s, and because we can walk to that bougie store that only sells Canada Goose jackets. That’s a part of loving Harvard Square, we’re not in this bustling city, we’re in this special locale.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should regulate the use and distribution of recreational marijuana?
NO: I think Cambridge should be careful where these dispensaries are going, and what they’re in close proximity to. There are a lot of schools here, and I think Cambridge needs to be thinking about where these are going, and in proximity to what.

Hari Pillai grew up the son of Indian immigrants in Mississippi. Though he has been living in the Boston area since 2000, he has been living in Cambridge for the past five years.  Formally trained as an engineer, he has experience working in finance. He says he will think outside the box on the City Council, and his top issues are opposing the Trump administration, providing more affordable housing, and increasing voter turnout in local elections. 
Editor’s note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
THE HARVARD CRIMSON: What do you think are the biggest issues facing the Cambridge City Council?
HARI PILLAI: The biggest issues that I’m always hearing about pertain to affordable housing. Without a doubt, everybody's asking questions about what's your plans for making it easier to rent or buy a home here. That's the biggest one right there.
THC:  What do you think Cambridge should be doing to provide affordable housing for its residents?
HP: My wife and I live in Alewife. Three years ago we only had one apartment here, now we got five. Now these companies that are making these apartments, they are doing speculation, they're on an industrial level doing some kind of speculation. If you look at the financial statements for the companies that are publically traded, they are exceptionally profitable, much more profitable than Microsoft and Facebook combined. We have to bypass that middleman profit motive and do it ourselves. When we do that there's other kinds of benefits, too. We also need to look at creative kind of solutions like cooperative living arrangements, co-housing. I use to live in a housing co-op in Central Square for three years, I loved it. I'll tell you one other thing: in Somerville they introduced legislation a couple years ago for an artist community, it would be a cooperative living arrangement for artists. I’d love to see that here in Cambridge. We maintain our sense of uniqueness if we do that, we lose our sense of uniqueness when we allow big developers to do it. Another thing I do think is that we've got to increase the inclusionary zoning.
THC: Why should Cantabrigians vote for you over other candidates?
HP: Every one of us identifies as liberal, progressive, Democrat or one variation of these things and we all want affordable housing, we all want to reduce income inequality, we’re all appalled by this administration of hate, every one of us, we all stand shoulder to shoulder on that. I think I'm the only one with fresh perspectives that's creative and that's not afraid to stick my neck out. I’m not afraid to be unpopular.
THC: How do you think Harvard and other Cambridge universities should work with the city to help the housing situation?
H: I think we should look into taxing them. They've got a lot of ventures that doesn't exactly look like a non-for-profit venture, look at MITIMCo, MITs investment management company, they're no different than a mutual fund or a private equity fund. I think we should look into taxing them. Harvard, they owed $50 million last year in payments in lieu of taxes.  I think it would be very selfish if I said that Cantabrigians should get all that tax money, that's not my view. I think the whole state should tax and split the taxes fairly. I definitely don't think that Cambridge should be entitled to all that tax.
THC: Pivoting to President Donald Trump, and I know this is one of your top priorities, how do you think, specifically, Cambridge should respond to President Trump’s policies?
H: I offer my candidacy as one that stands as a counterpoint to this administration of hate. We’re not going to have that here. First of all I'm big into unity, across different generations, across different religions or lack of religions, different complexions and socio-economics. Another thing when it comes to Trump’s policies, I want to have a legal defense fund of $100,000 to come to the aid of someone who can't defend themselves if they are deported. These are just some things I want to do to counteract this administration of hate.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should balance the need for more bike lanes and concerns from residents who say that they take up all of the parking spaces in the city?
H: This is been one of the most contentious issues. Bicycle lanes, that's the future, it makes the city more beautiful too, it makes the city more interesting and unique. I hope that more cities put in bicycle lanes. I'm actually pro-bicycle, but I'm also pro-proportionality. We should have a fair and intellectually honest conversation. Here are my empirical observations: the bicycling enthusiasts a lot of them come from the Midwest, California, just far away from Massachusetts and New England in general. The people that rely on their vehicles are more working class, blue collar, and they have a longer history of being from Cambridge. The bicycling community, it appears to me, are more likely to be middle class, upper-middle class, I think that's a blind spot that no one's talking about. I think we should talk about that and look into that… I've seen a lot of these bike lanes and they're not great, a lot of them give me a false sense of safety, they are just nominal paint lines.
Z: What do you think the city should do to preserve or develop Harvard Square’s historical architecture?
HP: I think I'm better served at listening to what people say, and that's all I can do. I'm not going to pretend that I know everything. A lot of cities are losing their uniqueness, like a Toledo, Ohio. I don't want that sense of placelessness to happen in Cambridge, and all I know is that it should be unique.

Massachusetts native Jeff Santos, who was recently endorsed by 2016 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders at a local Our Revolution rally, plans to use his special platform as a radio talk show host to benefit the people of Cambridge. Santos is an activist and an advocate for the people of Cambridge, focusing on economic equality, infrastructure, and public transportation. If elected, Santos says he will work towards more affordable housing and a rent-to-own collaboration with MIT, an improved MBTA, better bike lanes, and a continuation of Cambridge’s stance as a sanctuary city.
Editor’s note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
THE HARVARD CRIMSON: What do you think are the biggest issues facing Cambridge City Council?
JEFF SANTOS: Cambridge is having problems with economic divide in so many areas that is complicating things for the middle class: it’s quickly disappearing. That comes from housing. We need to pull together and ask for MIT to be a good corporate and academic citizen and give the opportunity to have middle class homes in the Volpe Center. I am proposing a rent to own because it is very difficult for anyone who doesn’t make a quarter of a million a year to buy a home.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should balance the need for more bike lanes but also balance concerns from residents who are annoyed by bike lanes taking up space?
JS: There’s already a proposal for the grand junction line that goes from the river to Somerville off of Main Street and so forth, for a bike path. I go further using the Porter Square commuter rail that starts at North Station in Porter Square that goes all the way to Pittsburgh. We rode the line the other day—a couple campaigners and myself—and you can utilize that as bike paths. That goes behind Alewife; that goes behind Porter Square. People would use that line; it would be safer for cyclists. It’s a more pleasant ride than with traffic and everything else. That’s a way to make everyone feel part of the city and be able to get around.
We need to be clear about making sure it’s safe. We can’t have senior citizens who normally park in front of Skenderian Pharmacy no longer feeling safe getting out of their car. They may hit a cyclist on the way out or another car.
THC: How do you think that the City Council has responded to President Donald Trump and a lot of the policies he is trying to put in place, and do you think that has been enough?
JS: I think we can always do more, but I think it’s been an effective response. I think what both Mayor E. Denise Simmons and Vice Mayor Marc C. McGovern have talked about in the opposition to Trump and with sanctuary cities is a good thing, but I would take it a step further. I would make sure that Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials who are acting in a dictatorial way do not have the ability and that police would protect churches and schools. These are places of haven and support, and these immigrants and people are seeking refuge. And we should not allow, Cambridge police should not allow ICE officials to scout and camp out at these locations trying to arrest people. That would be the thing I make clear.
THC: What do you think about how Harvard and other Cambridge universities can work with the city and help the housing situation?
JS: MIT and Harvard have billion-dollar endowments. In my opinion, there should be an understanding, whether it is taxes or other areas, that they can contribute to the people. There’s still poverty in Cambridge; there’s a lot of need to fix infrastructure in Cambridge. There’s a lot of things that both universities can do… whether it’s through taxes or some sort of understanding that their city will become just rich and poor. That will have a massive impact on the city and on the region.
THC:  How do you think Cambridge should regulate the use and distribution of recreational marijuana?
JS: I believe that we should have recreational marijuana, but we need an educational process. One of the things I am concerned about is you can be impaired smoking and driving. That is very, very dangerous, and we should clamp down on that. If you shut down the MBTA at 12:30 a.m. and your bars are open until 2 a.m., that’s another scenario I could never find out why that would happen. Of course, it helps Uber and Lyft and taxis, but if people can’t afford it, then they get into their own cars. Not everybody wants to do it, so we have to be careful and educate people at an early age, just as we have with alcohol and smoking. If we don’t educate people, it’s going to be problematic.
THC: Why should Cantabrigians vote for you over the other candidates?
JS: The difference between me and the other 25 is I have a bigger platform. I will keep my radio show if I win. That will give me the opportunity to fight for major issues. For instance, rent to own is not going to be an easy fight because developers have more money and a lot of ability to nix that issue. Well, I’ve got people on the air motivated to move. That makes so many issues I’ll focus on have the ability to move City Council. That’s the difference: the platform and the ability to fight for Cantabrigians. I’m endorsed by 12 labor unions; these are fighters. I’m proud to be endorsed by them. I am concerned that no citizen in Cambridge is left behind.
THC: Do you think the City Council should focus on local issues or are you pretty steadfast on focusing on issues caused by Trump?
JS: Cambridge is not an island. Even though climate change may make it one day if we don’t start maneuvering on this, we are all connected. Just to stay local and stay in your region makes no sense. We need to work with state governments; we need to advocate. Cambridge is a city of 110,000. Its proximity to Boston is right across the river. We shouldn’t just be hanging out and saying, “Alright, let everybody else take care of it.”

Sumbul Siddiqui, a Pakistani immigrant and a Cantabrigian since the age of two, is running for her first term on City Council. Having grown up in Cambridge public housing, she is an advocate for affordable housing, a central issue to her platform. Siddiqui studied public policy at Brown and law at Northwestern and currently works as an attorney at Northeast Legal Aid, a non-profit legal services organization in Massachusetts. Siddiqui said she hopes to use her professional experience to serve the Cambridge community. Former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders endorsed Siddiqui and four other City Council candidates at an Our Revolution rally earlier this month. 
Editor’s Note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity. 
The Harvard Crimson: What do you think are the biggest issues facing the Cambridge City Council?
Sumbul Siddiqui: The number one would be the affordable housing issue. This is not anything new. This faced the Council 10 years ago and it’s going to continue facing the council the next 10-15 years. I grew up in public housing in Cambridge, so for me, it’s a big issue recognizing how we’ve become a city where you have to aggregate a ton of money: it’s expensive to live here.
My platform is focused on that, and then also on how we can really make sure that our young people, and even older adults, benefit from the innovative economy. That can mean several things: making sure that our students are working and getting training through a union to be in these buildings that are getting built. It can also mean, for other people who are wanting to do internships, that we have strong enough programs.
Another priority is development and economic justice. What I mean by that specifically is that the city has become a place where you have to have a lot of money to do business and have a business. I really want to make sure that we have more mom and pop shops.
I’m really passionate about civic engagement in general. I’m 29 years old. I’ve realized that a lot of people our age don’t vote. People ages 18 to 30 make up a big population here, but it’s unfortunately a low voter turnout. So for me, running is really about connecting this population to the City Council.
THC: Why should Cantabrigians vote for you over other candidates?
SS: I think it goes it back to my experience and professional background. I am the only woman running who has grown up here, so I think that’s very valuable in the sense that I have long-term roots. I’m not planning to go anywhere. This is a city I know.
Also, we have to have more diversity on the council. I think it’s very important that we have more women, and that we have more women of color. I think someone who is a qualified public attorney who happens to be a Muslim woman of color, you talk the talk for diversity and all that stuff, but this is a time that we can actually make it happen.
THC: What do you think Cambridge should be doing to provide affordable housing for its residents?
SS: This is going to be a multi-faceted approach. It’s not going to happen overnight. There’s no clear solution. We have to first look at ways to really add more money for our affordable housing trust. That trust is a source of funding for current affordable housing. We have to continue to figure out ways to contribute to that trust.
We can also identify other taxes to make sure that we’re getting as much money as possible from the commercial development that’s occurring. That money will go towards the trust and also it will go towards preserving long-term affordability.
I grew up in the Rindge Towers over in North Cambridge that have price regulations expiring in 2020, and I can’t tell you how many people are so worried about what could happen. So we have to identify all the ways that we can save money.
Affordable housing is not going to be the only way. The city is going to have to think about building its own housing. That goes back to how much money we have in that affordable housing trust. It’s a combination of looking at policies that will create more money for affordable housing and then also look for spaces.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should respond to President Donald Trump’s policies?
SS: I think City Councillors have stood up to Trump and are outspoken about his policies and his complete disrespect for our Constitution. I think that the policy order that they filed to impeach him was a little waste of time and energy, in my opinion. It just seems really impossible to do that, and so I felt that a better statement would have just been saying that they disagree with their policies and they’re not going to abide by them.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should balance the need for more bike lanes and concerns from residents who say they take up their parking space?
SS: I think we know that the elderly need parking. I think we know that if you’re disabled, you really need parking. So we have to prioritize those needs. At the end of the day, we have to make a compromise. If we want to be a city that is committed to fixing climate change, it’s better to bike. But we have to realize that not everyone can bike, so we have to recognize that some people have to drive.
We have to make sure that the Community Development Department is meeting with non-cyclists and cyclists, and find optimal locations for the lanes to actually be sustained and used. We’ll also then have to do some follow-up and see if it’s working. We need to have some evaluations and follow up the Cambridge bike plans.

Vatsady Sivongxay, a new candidate for the Cambridge City Council, believes that the strength of the Cantabrigian community lies in its diversity. A former refugee from Laos, Sivongxay looks back fondly at her work as a pro-bono attorney as well as her work opening a law firm to help small businesses and immigrants. Later, she served as the Director of Public Policy for Boston City Council District 7, working on affordable housing and urban planning initiatives. Sivongxay was recently endorsed by 2016 Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders at a local Our Revolution rally. 
Editor’s note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
The Harvard Crimson: What do you think are the biggest issues facing the Cambridge City Council?
Vatsady Sivongxay: I think the City Council needs to collaborate more on some of the issues that have been long-standing challenges in our city, that we need to be able to talk about our different perspectives, and that we then have to see how we can work together to take actions and to hold the government and developers accountable.
THC: Why should Cantabrigians vote for you over other candidates?
VS: I bring very unique professional life experiences to City Council. I came over to the U.S. as a refugee when I was four years old, and from a very early age, I encountered many challenges, whether it was social or economic. So, I really bring a multifaceted approach to creating diverse solutions for the community.
I’ve always had to work really hard to get opportunities. I remember selling things when I was 11 to pay for sports outfits and also later on, to pay for dresses for homecoming and prom and to just really be a part of the American culture. That really showed me how much community dedication and support was needed for someone like me to successful, and that really allowed me to see opportunities in communities that are really difficult to define. I had the chance to open a law firm that helped people who came from disadvantaged backgrounds.
I think I am the only candidate who has had these experiences and who has had the opportunity to work with many different people. And the challenges I’ve worked on were in Cambridge, so I know the area well. I can bring those equity lens and creativity lens to Cambridge and really work with the diverse community here.
THC: What do you think Cambridge should be doing to provide affordable housing for its residents?
VS: One thing that Cambridge can really lead on is expanding the definition of affordable housing to include moderate to low income housing. So right now, at least 43 percent of our population is house burdened, or spending more than 30 percent of their income on rent or mortgage. Ideally a household should be spending less so you can pay for necessary expenses. This means that moderate to low income households are really paying a much higher rate than they need to, or that they should, and that means they can’t save for the future or for their children. And that’s a big issue because it can cause generations of debt and generations of not being able to pursue this American Dream that we have that so many generations have strived for.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should respond to President Donald Trump’s policies?
VS: Cambridge has been a sanctuary city for a long time, I think Cambridge has been showing real leadership of welcoming people of all backgrounds. I’m quite proud of our administration and organizations. I don’t think I can be prouder of another city.
THC: Do you think that the City Council has done enough to respond to Trump, or do you think it has done too much to respond to Trump and should focus more on local issues?
VS: I think that Cambridge has a pretty good balance focusing on local issues and also responding to national policies. The trick is working with the residents, working with them in terms of when it comes to other services and health. I see actions in response to local needs, and I think Cambridge is stepping up as much as it can. There’s always room for improvement, but that’s always the case in every single city.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should balance the need for more bike lanes and concerns from residents who say they take up their parking space?
VS: I live a block away from Cambridge St., and people in my area have diverse opinions. I think that this is an opportunity for Cambridge to create a pedestrian, biker-and-driver friendly plan so people who say they want to walk their kids to school, can. I believe we really need to have an inclusive  community-driven process, and I think that there needs to be this community-comprehensive process and implementation, so everyone can contribute to a safer city.
THC: How do you think the City should or should not preserve Harvard Square’s historical architecture?
VS: I think that Harvard Square is a very unique place. It is a place where residents really enjoy hanging out, and tourists really enjoy heading to Harvard Square to see the sights and the leaders in education and leaders in a lot of community-focused initiatives. I think as far as we’re preserving our community and our historical spaces, we need to ensure that our goods and services are also works that meet the needs of the people.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should regulate the use and distribution of recreational marijuana?
VS: I know that a lot of people want to have a say in regulating recreational marijuana. If it is legal to provide recreational marijuana, I think the city needs to work with the state to work out a place to do so that is accessible and safe for the community. Clear it away from the schools, the libraries, similar places—but other than that, I would really like the city to work with residents and the state in determining how to regulate and how to place it.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: December 29, 2017
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that Vatsady Sivongxay said 23 percent of the Cambridge population is house burdened. In fact, Sivongxay said 43 percent of the Cambridge population is house burdened.

A scientist at Siemens, Bryan Sutton is one of 26 candidates running for Cambridge City Council this year. Sutton moved to Cambridge a few years ago and has since joined several volunteer and political reform groups. If elected, he plans to focus on providing affordable housing, eliminating money in politics, combatting climate change, and increasing government participation by better reaching out to the people of Cambridge. An engineer in the transportation industry, Sutton plans to draw upon previous experiences to work on and complete the extensive projects that he hopes will improve the city.
Editor’s note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity. 
The Harvard Crimson: What do you think are the biggest issues facing the Cambridge City Council?
Bryan Sutton: There is a disparity between people’s interests and what they believe the Council is doing. I think that the biggest challenge the City Council has is continued outreach, which is really the purpose of the Council. It has to act as the representative voice of all 110,000 people living in Cambridge and that is definitely their largest threat.
THC: Why should Cantabrigians vote for you over other candidates?
BS: I bring a long professional career in engineering and transportation, so I have experience dealing with projects with different parties. I also recognize that every problem we talk about in Cambridge is because of a privatized campaign funding system. A lot of things are funded privately and so elected officials work for their donors. I propose publicly funded elections in Cambridge, I propose term limits, and I propose a longer cooling off period after you’re elected before you can work for a developer or lobbyist firm.
THC: What do you think Cambridge should be doing to provide affordable housing for its residents?
BS: The number one issue with the city is definitely affordable housing. The inclusionary rate has been maintained around 15 percent affordable housing the past two years. Recently, the city council looked into a transfer tax. That’s the first step and that’s good. You can also straight up tax people. I’m an engineer. I do project management. The way you approach stuff like this is you lay out the numbers, find out what the cost is. You have to measure all the different factors: the projected population growth rate; the projected development rate; how many inclusionary, or affordable housing units we expect to have. And project that all for five years so when we make a change, ask “What impact do we expect to see on affordable housing in five years? What impact do we expect to see on housing costs for the next five years?”
THC: How do you think Harvard and other Cambridge universities should work with the city to help the housing situation?
BS: They play a humongous role in the city. If we make an affordable housing scorecard and get them involved, we’re just going to get a better result. It’s a matter of growing a collaboration in any way we can. There is a group of residents in Cambridge who believe that Harvard and MIT owe more housing units to the city than they are already providing.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should respond to President Donald Trump’s policies?
BS: We should 100 percent do the right thing and what the residents of Cambridge want us to do. As an example, it’s been clear as a community that illegal immigrants are accepted in Cambridge. Everything I’ve seen is that most of the people in Cambridge want us to remain a sanctuary city. I 100 percent agree with that. I think we almost have an obligation to stand up and raise our hand every time he steps out of line and say “No, we want to maintain our promise to the Paris agreement, we want to maintain our promise to the people in our community, whatever their documented status is, it doesn’t matter, they’re part of our community.” And we should start reaching out to neighbor cities and have a coalition of cities do the right thing.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should balance the need for more bike lanes and concerns from residents who say they take up their parking space?
BS: Even within the city of Cambridge, there’s different areas that want different things. Nine elected officials don’t have the capacity to make a decision that will affect 30,000 people without getting any input. Holding a public discussion on a Wednesday evening isn’t good enough because a lot of people can’t make that. I think that we should better utilize the communication technology at our disposal. And there’s no reason why we can’t online poll and get an actual majority of what people, what specific areas of Cambridge, want. I think we need to make a concerted effort to better poll and gauge public opinion proactively.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should regulate the use and distribution of recreational marijuana?
BS: Whenever we talk about recreational marijuana, it’s important to talk about illegal substances on a larger point. Minority groups are still almost four times as likely to be arrested for marijuana possession, so it didn’t completely address that issue. I think we have an opportunity now to really get at the heart of addressing opioid addiction. We should embrace legalized marijuana and try to normalize it to the point where it’s looked at like tobacco or alcohol or other legal controlled substances. If somebody is getting high on heroin, sending him to jail is not going to help. Sending him public health efforts is. Addiction is a public health issue.

Born and raised in Cambridge, Sean Tierney highlights his legal background—particularly in housing and tax policy—as a main strength of his candidacy. After college, Tierney began his career working at Harvard’s Institute of Politics before attending Suffolk Law School. He’s since worked as an affordable housing attorney at the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights, taught constitutional law at a Roxbury High School, and helped to draft the Fair Share Amendment to the Mass. constitution, which will tax millionaires as a higher rate. As a City Council candidate, Tierney aims to use his legal skills to tackle Cambridge’s affordable housing crisis.
Editor’s note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
The Harvard Crimson: You’ve been doing legal work for a long time. Why did you choose now to run for office?
Sean Tierney: I work as an affordable housing attorney. Housing is such an issue here in Cambridge, and I really felt I had something to contribute to the city. I grew up here in Cambridge. I volunteer at a high school for the football team and I felt that I had so many different connections to different communities in the city but also this policy experience, so it seemed the right time to jump in and contribute.
THC: You’ve talked a little bit about housing. Would you say that’s the core of your campaign?
ST: The core of our campaign is about affordable housing and having professional experience and connections to the city. One of the slogans we toyed around with is “Respect the history, represent the future.” Cambridge has this rich history I want to represent but I’m also a young person and I want to figure out how we can have Cambridge develop into this great city moving forward and accommodate the new people who want to live here and those who graduate from Harvard and MIT and want to stay. Back in the 90s that wasn’t the case—they would go to California and New York. We need to provide opportunities for them and also keep those long-time families. It’s really about diversity in Cambridge.
THC: What makes you the best candidate out of the large number this year?
ST: I have a strong record for working on progressive issues. I worked for the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights, taught constitutional law. I worked on tax policy and helped draft the Fair Share Amendment, which is going to tax millionaires as a higher rate. For housing, I have experience no one else has.

Paul F. Toner is a lifelong resident of Cambridge, an educator, and a political advocate who is running for Cambridge City Council for the first time this year. Toner began his career as a social studies teacher and later became president of the Cambridge Teachers Association and Massachusetts Teachers Association. He is currently the Executive Director of Teach Plus Massachusetts. Toner says his campaign prioritizes fostering civil discourse on the City Council, solving housing and transportation issues, and promoting economic growth in Cambridge. 
Editor’s note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
The HARVARD CRIMSON: What do you think are the biggest issues facing the Cambridge City Council today?
PT: Well, issue number one that I want to focus on is bringing back a civil discourse to the Council work. I feel like there’s been an awful lot of infighting, not focusing on the problem, but focusing on personalities, so I think we need to do that. The actual problems that we face are pretty obviously developing more affordable housing, but not just low-income subsidized housing, but housing for the middle class and the working class of Cambridge.
We need to build up more housing stock for all income levels in the city. But I also think Cambridge can only do so much so we have to have regional solutions. So I think we should and can do more in terms of housing issues and transportation issues in Cambridge, like working on the issues of bike lanes and providing alternative transportation through the city of Cambridge, but the real challenge is working with the other cities and towns around us to get them to do their fair share in terms of housing, and also to come up with streamlined ways to get people in and out of Boston.
THC: So you talked about affordable housing. What specifically do you think Cambridge should be doing to promote affordable housing?
PT: Well, I think the city can and should, where it can, buy properties that are undeveloped. Either from private owners or take land through eminent domain if it’s sitting unused. But we can’t do all of it.
I think there has to be many more public-private partnerships. And in addition we need to look at, transportation hubs like Harvard Square and Porter Square and Kendall Square and Central Square, and really build as much housing as we can centrally around those transportation hubs. And we may have to be more flexible with our zoning codes and our rules around those areas. Let them build higher and more densely in those areas.
We should be working with Harvard and MIT, and the other institutions of higher education to get them to build more housing for graduate students, affordable housing for graduate students, because my understanding is that a lot of the graduate housing is more expensive on the campus than it is off campus, so they have to come up with some affordable solutions for these young people.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should respond to President Donald Trump’s policies?
PT: We all know Cambridge tends to be on the more liberal side and I think most Cantabrigians, as well as many Americans, are disappointed in the President’s proclamations and a lot of the decisions he’s made since he’s been in office. Cambridge is taking an “all politics is local” approach and they’re recognizing that we might not be able to change federal policy, but we’re going to do everything we can in Cambridge to protect our current residents to make sure they’re getting the services they need and the protections they need.
THC: So you said you think the City Council has responded appropriately. Can you talk about what that response has looked like?
PT: On environmental issues, there’s only so much we can do at the city and local level, but Cambridge is committing itself to being a greener, more energy-efficient city. On issues like working with our police, to ensure that the police are following appropriate policies without violating the rights of our citizens, these are all areas Cambridge has been strong on for a long time.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should balance the needs for more bike lanes and concerns of citizens who say they take up their parking spaces?
PT: I think we have to have more and better safer bike lanes throughout the city. I was unwilling to commit to the Bicycle Safety Advisory Committee’s pledge that within four years we’ll have 20 miles of protected bike lanes. I want to hear from more people in the city about where they are and where those bike lanes should be and how they should be rolled out and implemented before I commit the city to a specific plan.
THC: How do you think the city should or should not preserve Harvard Square’s historical architecture?
PT: I certainly would not want to make any radical changes to what’s been here for 400 years, or at least 200 years. I do think that not everything is a historically protected piece of architecture. If it means providing some flexibility to folks to provide more housing or to make Harvard Square more viable for our local businesses, then I’m open to providing that flexibility, but anything that's protected under historical preservation I certainly wouldn’t want to tamper with.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should regulate the use and distribution of recreational marijuana?
PT: I have not dug deeply into this issue. I’m still waiting for all the rules and regulations from the state of Massachusetts to roll out. The ballot question last year legalized it, now the question is where in Cambridge, as people apply for licenses, will those vendors be sited. I think there’s going to be pushback from a lot of people. I think there are only certain places in Cambridge that are going to be very welcoming, and we’re going to have to work through that issue with the folks in the different neighborhoods. Some neighborhoods I believe are going to be very opposed to having recreational marijuana vendors in their neighborhoods, and the City Council is going to have to work with the zoning board to work out those details and engage in a very serious discussion with the residents of Cambridge.

First elected to the City Council in 1989, Timothy J. Toomey, Jr. is running again this year as an incumbent. He has also worked on the Cambridge School Board Committee and represented Cambridge neighborhoods during his 12 terms as a State Representative. He is running on a platform of increasing affordable housing, preserving open spaces, fostering economic growth, promoting social justice, and improving constituent services. 
Editor’s note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
The Harvard Crimson: What do you think are the biggest issues facing the Cambridge City Council?
Timothy J. Toomey, Jr.: One of the overriding issues in the city of Cambridge is how we maintain our diversity and affordability for all of our residents. Cambridge has certainly been a very attractive city for people to want to come to live and work, and we’re seeing the housing prices increase tremendously. We are trying to maintain that diversity...I grew up in a working class household here in East Cambridge close to the port and seeing what the housing prices are now; it’s very difficult for working class families to be able to afford those prices or remain in the city. I would hate to see that diversity or that socioeconomic mix be threatened. I don’t want to see the city become the city of the haves and have nots.
THC: Why should Cantabrigians vote for you over other candidates?
TJT: I served four years on the Cambridge School Committee, I’ve been on the Cambridge City Council since 1989, and I’ve served 24 years as State Representative for parts of Somerville and Cambridge. So clearly I had the experience serving on the state and local level to know how to get things done. I know where to go to find assistance for people. I maintain a district office. I’m the only candidate or even current Councillor that pays for a district office at 550 Cambridge Street so that people can come see me there and they don’t have to go to City Hall. Constituent service is very important to me. Other people get elected and see themselves above everyone else, but if you’re not there on the ground level working for families and the people, you lose focus. 
THC: What do you think Cambridge should be doing to provide affordable housing for its residents?
TJT: We increase the number to 20 percent [affordable housing] of any development over 12 units. That was one of the things we just voted on Monday night for the vote for rezoning. That’s going to be 280 units of affordable housing for our residents and about 20 percent of that is going to be family units of three beds or more. I propose the transfer fee of property that’s sold. An additional fee which will go in the housing trust fund to enable the city to purchase more units and one of the big things that I have been working on forever is that in certain parts of the city including where you’re going to school don’t really provide many units of affordable housing in the city.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should respond to President Donald Trump’s policies?
TJT: Do a lot of praying. But, seriously, Cambridge is certainly affected by his things around Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and cutbacks. We have spoken out unanimously against what some of his policies have been and what he is trying to do. I think we have been at the forefront of that since he got elected and we will continue to do that and speak out against those issues. Ten years ago, I did an op-ed about in-state tuition as a state representative in Massachusetts allowing undocumented students to attend state universities and pay the same tuition as a state resident. Unfortunately, that was vetoed by the Governor back then. We are a sanctuary city. I think Cambridge has really been on the forefront of those issues. We do a lot of resolutions when he proposes new policies.
THC: Do you think they have done too much to respond to Trump and should focus more on local issues?
TJT: It is always a balance. I’m always in my district office so I’m in the neighborhoods. There are a lot of national issues that we have to pay close attention to. Some people, when they get elected to City Council think they are going to Washington and when someone calls when the streetlight is out or when there is a pothole, they get insulted over that minor issue but you know, local government is very important. We are the closest ones to the people. There are only 100 U.S. Senators. How close are they to the people? There are 435 Congressman. It is important for local officials to be out there listening and responding.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should balance the need for more bike lanes and concerns from residents who say they take up their parking space?
TJT: Everyone wants safe access for the bicycles, pedestrians and motorists. Cambridge was built a couple hundred years ago so it is difficult to accommodate all three in all streets in the city without taking away parking.
THC: Do you think the City Council should approve a motion from the Cambridge Historical Commission to preserve the Harvard Square kiosk?
TJT: Yes, I do.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should regulate the use and distribution of recreational marijuana?
TJT: We have in place different zoning for where the sale of the recreational marijuana can be located. I still have concerns about how people are going to be tested under the influence. I am hearing from a lot of people already. It is uncharted territory that is going to evolve as it becomes legal in July of next year.

Gwen T. Volmar is the Assistant Director of Undergraduate Research and Fellowships at Harvard College. She has previously worked for the Human Rights Watch and Teachers Without Borders. This year, she is running for Cambridge City Council on a platform that addresses affordable housing problems, homelessness, addiction and mental illness, and education. She hopes to make City Council a place where representatives understand the “lived experience of Cambridge.” 
Editor’s note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
The Harvard Crimson: What do you think are the biggest issues facing the Cambridge City Council?
Gwen T. Volmar: We’re at the precipice of the point of no return when it comes to affordability in Cambridge, when it comes to diversity in Cambridge. We’re at a place where if we continue to let the market dictate what happens in Cambridge unchecked, then we will no longer be able to say, “This is who we want to live in our city?” Unless we actively do something to bridle what’s happening in the market, we will be over the precipice. So what is important at this point to the Council, is to decide, “Are we going to act? If we do, what does that mean? And who’s going to be the beneficiary of that?”
THC: Why should Cantabrigians vote for you over other candidates?
GTV: My experience in Cambridge is unique to this setting. There are a lot of people here who really struggle to pay the rent and bills, who have dealt with using or abusing drugs, who have dealt with homelessness, who have dealt with serious problems. That’s my friend base, that’s my family base, that’s my personal experience, that I’m still living in the same apartment that I moved into when I was 22, thinking that was going to be temporary, but I’m still there ten years later. That’s the kind of thing so many Cantabrigians experience, and somehow it’s not being reflected in their representatives.
THC: What do you think Cambridge should be doing to provide affordable housing for its residents?
GTV: It’s not going to be resolved with one single solution, so there are a lot of short-term and long-term solutions. Long-term solutions would be doing something like submitting a Home Rule Petition to the state government to ask them for more powers to actually be able to govern ourselves in terms of taxes, in terms of lobbying.
In the more immediate term, there’s a program that I’m advocating for that is already in place in Dallas, where there’s a group that will rent directly from a landlord and sublet to a voucher holder. It assuages landlords’ concerns, and it gets a voucher holder into a property they wouldn’t otherwise be able to access.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should respond to President Donald Trump’s policies? Do you think that the City Council has done enough to respond to Trump?
GTV: There’s a lot that Cambridge can’t do. But there’s certainly a lot that Cambridge can do that I think we’re not talking about. Cambridge is a sanctuary city, and that is in direct contrast to the message that’s being sent from the federal government. Cambridge could also do things like work with those people to help them find employment because when you’re undocumented you’re not only facing the problem “I might get deported,” you’re also facing the problem “I can’t legally work,” you’re also facing the problem, “My family might experience all these painful problems.” So Cambridge could be doing these things, so that they can actually build a home here as opposed to only merely existing.
THC: Do you think they have done too much to respond to Trump and should focus more on local issues?
GTV: There are things that Cambridge has done that are largely symbolic like voting to impeach Trump. Assuming they don’t detract from a significant amount of time to be spent on other Cambridge things, I’m actually okay with Cambridge taking a symbolic stance.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should balance the need for more bike lanes and concerns from residents who say they take up their parking space?
GTV: The bike lane issue specifically is a good example of populations with mutually exclusive desires, a city council having to make a hard decision, and frankly, both populations not feeling terribly listened to as a result of that deliberative process. There are a number of measures that need to be taken. Certainly, any decision the City Council makes, you want citizens to feel as if they’ve been listened to, even if the decision didn’t ultimately go their way. That has to be the step that’s taken every time, and I think it’s a step that wasn’t taken carefully with the bike lane decision.
Now the decision is made, my feeling is we need to be willing to give it the time to see if it works. Let’s experiment with it. If it we find that businesses aren't suffering, then we’ll keep it. If we find that it’s not working, we have to have the courage to take a step back, to rethink, and to reassess. If I’m going to be the one that’s advocating for experimenting, I have to also be the one advocating for being willing to change our minds if it didn’t work.
THC: How do you think the city should or should not preserve Harvard Square’s historical architecture?
GTV: We are absolutely in danger of losing historic character to gentrification, which will push those things out and replace them with things like luxury restaurants, things that tend not to encourage community and tend not to preserve the kinds of values that we value here in Cambridge. So that will take some proactive steps to say we actually value these things more than we value efficiency. That might seem painful; these are difficult decisions. We have to acknowledge we are prioritizing certain things that are going to hurt something else. Everything we do doesn’t happen in a vacuum.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should regulate the use and distribution of recreational marijuana?
GTV: Cambridge voted overwhelmingly to support recreational marijuana. I want to make sure that when we do actually start seeing commercial distribution set up in Cambridge that it’s done in such a way that we’ve made clear that we value local, small-scale businesses.

Quinton Zondervan is a entrepreneur, founder of the biotech company Excelimmune, CTO of eCare Vault, Board Chair of the Green Cambridge nonprofit, and president of the Board of Directors of the Climate Action Business Association.  Having worked on the Net Zero Action Plan and witnessed the 2015 Paris Agreement, Zondervan said he is passionate about sustainability and climate change issues.  He also believes creating affordable housing is a crucial task facing the City Council.  Zondervan is an immigrant from Suriname and graduate of MIT.
Editor’s note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
THE HARVARD CRIMSON: What do you think are the biggest issues facing the Cambridge City Council?
QUINTON ZONDERVAN: Affordable housing, sustainable transportation, climate change.
THC: Why do you think the people of Cambridge should vote for you over other candidates?
QZ: Because of all the challengers, I have the most experience making policy in the city of Cambridge, working with the community, City Council, and city staff.  I’ve already passed major policy initiatives in Cambridge, including in 2013 I filed the Net Zero zoning petition which led to the Net Zero Action Plan that was adopted by the City Council in 2015.This spring, I also worked with Councilor Jan Devereux to pass a “100 percent renewable energy by 2035” resolution in the City Council.   I’ve served on the Climate Protection Action Committee which advises the city government on climate change policy for the last nine years and chaired it for three.  So, I bring a lot of experience working on policy initiatives and advocating for policies in the City of Cambridge.  I also bring a lot of professional experience.  I myself am an entrepreneur.  I started my own biotech company in Cambridge.
THC: What do you think Cambridge should be doing to provide affordable housing for its residents?
QZ: Some of the things that I’ve proposed in my platform include increasing the inclusionary zoning, so that when we have a new construction, we get more affordable housing, increasing the linkage fees so that when we have a commercial development, we get more revenue for the city for protecting and creating affordable housing. We have to look at ways to reduce the speculation in our real estate market because it’s driving up the cost of land and the cost of housing.  So some of the ideas that I’m proposing there are a vacancy tax, to tax vacant properties that are underutilized and a foreign buyer’s tax, so this would be applying to foreign investors buying property in Cambridge.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should respond to President Donald Trump’s policies?
QZ: What I think we should do is deepen our commitment to justice, and that includes affordable housing policies, making sure that we create jobs for people, and making sure that we provide people with affordable transportation options. For me personally, a priority is making sure that we take strong action on climate change. When we have a change in government at the federal level, which will happen eventually, we will be better prepared to take action at the federal level if we’ve already piloted some programs at the local level and state level.  We also need to protect our immigrants.  I am an immigrant myself, and it’s very important that we protect our safe community status in Cambridge.  We need to assist our immigrants in obtaining their paperwork, including paying for their DACA fee.
THC: Do you think the city council has done too much to respond to Trump and should focus more on local issues?
QZ: I don’t think so.  I mean, I think the Council passed a resolution calling for his impeachment or something like that.  I think that’s an appropriate response.  I think there’s broad agreement in Cambridge that President Trump is not really qualified for that job and even this week we’re seeing Republican senators echoing that sentiment.  So I think it’s highly appropriate for our elected representatives to go on record to say that they are opposed to this administration’s policies and that they don’t believe that Mr. Trump should be our President.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should balance the need for more bike lanes with the concerns of those who say they take up their parking spaces?
QZ: I recently met with a local business owner who is a good friend of mine. He has a fish market. The shop is on the corner of a main street and a residential street, and all the parking on the side street is resident parking only. My suggestion to him was what if we took the first four or five parking spots on that residential street and made them metered parking during the day and resident-only overnight, and we already have some spaces like that in Cambridge near local businesses.  So, I think we can be creative and we work together with all the stakeholders to make sure that we provide a complete solution.
The bike lanes would be on the main roads primarily.  The idea is to compensate for some of the parking that would be removed on the main road by allowing metered-parking on the side street.
THC: Do you think that the City Council should approve a motion from the Cambridge Historical Commission to preserve the Harvard Square kiosk?
QZ: I think again that we should preserve it, but should do it in a way that’s forward looking and creative so that it’s useful and a really great space. Some of the activists and advocates for that kiosk have come up with various designs for how that could be redone so that the space is more active and preserves the historical character of the kiosk.
THC: How do you think Cambridge should regulate the use and distribution of recreational marijuana?
QZ: The state has legalized it, and I think we should regulate it in the spirit of the state legislation and not impose unnecessary restrictions on it.
