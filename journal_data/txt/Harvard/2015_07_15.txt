After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After taking a tour through three of America’s largest media markets, Linsanity has settled in one of the nation’s sleepiest metropolises.
Following stints in New York, Houston, and Los Angeles, former Harvard men's basketball standout Jeremy Lin ’10 signed a two-year, $4.37 million contract with the Charlotte Hornets last week.
Lin, who endured an up-and-down season in L.A. after being traded to the Lakers by the Rockets, told ESPN that he hopes to “get back” to his strengths in Charlotte.
“I want to get back to what makes me what I am as a player, which is being aggressive, being on the attack and always charging toward the rim,” Lin told ESPN. “I think that will help create easier shots for this team.”
Although Lin averaged double digits for a fourth consecutive season last year, he did so while shooting his lowest percentage from the field (42.4 percent) since his rookie stint with Golden State. With his minutes (25.8) the lowest they had been since his first year, Lin struggled as the primary weapon in sluggish Laker bench units, posting the highest usage rate since his time in New York while seeing his true shooting percentage drop by more than 4 percent.
The one bright spot last season was Lin’s increased accuracy from beyond the three-point line. The 26-year-old has increased his shooting percentage from behind the arc in each season of his professional career and will provide the Hornets with some much-needed spacing after shooting nearly 37 percent last year.
“I don’t know what my limit is or how good I can be, but my goal is to find out,” Lin told ESPN.
