After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the Harvard men’s basketball team stayed close to home in the final week of 2011, traveling crosstown to face Boston College and hosting St. Joseph’s, two Ivy League foes took up a different strategy.
Escaping the dark northern winter, Penn and Yale took on two southern foes apiece. Despite smelling victory in their first battles, the teams ended up a combined 0-4.
The Quakers’ first southerly opponent was Davidson College, a small private school located just north of Charlotte, N.C. The Wildcats program was put on the map by Stephen Curry, who led the school to an Elite Eight appearance in the 2008 NCAA tournament. While Curry has moved on to the NBA, Davidson remains strong.  The team upset then-No. 12 Kansas on the road 10 days before facing Penn on Dec. 29.
The Red and Blue gave the Wildcats a struggle and was ahead 33-30 entering halftime. But Davidson proved too much to handle, taking the lead on a 10-2 run to start the second half. While Penn would cut the lead to three with a minute to go, it would never regain an advantage, eventually falling, 75-70.
That same night, the Bulldogs battled Wake Forest just an hour up the road in Winston-Salem, N.C. The Demon Deacons were projected to be one of the worst teams in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), though most experts have picked them to finish ahead of likely cellar-dwelling Boston College.
While the game was important for a Yale team seeking to prove itself against big-time competition, the match was doubly special to junior Michael Grace. Grace is a Winston-Salem native with two high school teammates now on Wake Forest’s roster.
Nearly 100 friends and members of Grace’s family were in attendance for what would be a thrilling finish. Down 19 points with 11:34 remaining, the Bulldogs continued to fight but ended up one point short. A three-point shot with seconds remaining was not enough as Yale lost, 73-72.
The Bulldogs didn’t have time to hang their heads as they traveled to Gainesville, Fla. to take on then-No. 10 Florida on New Year’s Eve. The Gators were no more rested after losing to Rutgers in double-overtime on the road two days prior.
Coming off of its worst performance of the season, Florida bounced back strong and rolled to a 20-point victory, 90-70. The Bulldogs jumped out to a 9-0 lead but could not keep up with an uber-talented Gators squad despite 26 points and 15 rebounds by Yale senior Greg Mangano on the night.
The Quakers faced a similar fate in their matchup with then-No. 5 Duke a night later. Playing at Cameron Indoor Stadium, one of the loudest arenas in the nation, the Blue Devils took an early 20-4 lead and never looked back, crushing Penn by 30, 85-55.
While the two Ivy squads returned north empty-handed, their four contests provided experience playing strong competition in hostile arenas that will be invaluable during conference play and beyond.
In recent years, it has become increasingly difficult for Ivy League teams to schedule these types of tests. BCS-conference schools have become wary of scheduling strong mid-major competition as the matchups present lose-lose situations. If the heavy favorite loses, it’s devastatingly embarrassing and potentially costly for a bubble team in March. But if they win, the victor has only done what it was supposed to do and doesn’t gain much of anything.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It truly is the most wonderful time of the year. On Dec. 25, we all shared in a gift that is way better than any Christmas sweater or box of chocolates. Yep, professional basketball is back. To ring in the good times, we at The Back Page have set out to find the best NBA match for several of Harvard’s own ballers. Which NBA player is most like each Crimson star? Keep reading to find out.
Keith Wright – 10.9 PPG, 7.6 RPG, 1.4 BPG (2011-2012 season)
Wright currently ranks second in Crimson history for career blocks with 126. The forward is only behind Brian Cusworth '07 who racked up 147. Wright is also second for most blocks in a season, a category in which his 2010-11 mark of 54 comes only five shy of the current record, set by Brian Banks in 1978. This season, Wright leads the team with an average of 1.4 blocks per game.
In another facet of his game, Wright dominates both the offensive and defensive glass. In fact, only one other Harvard player comes within four rebounds of Wright’s average of 7.4 per game (Kyle Casey with 5.9). Last year, Wright’s 8.3 rebounds per game not only led the Crimson, but earned him second place in the Ivy League. Much of this success can be attributed to his 6’8, 240 pound frame—a size that allows him to establish a strong presence down low. Which NBA player possesses Wright’s large frame and ability to block shots and rebound?
Al Jefferson – 15.9 PPG, 8.8 RPG, 1.4 BPG (Career) 
Like Wright, Al Jefferson has the ability to turn shots away. The 2010-11 NBA season was his most successful, as the NBA vet totaled 153 blocked shots in 82 regular season contests. And on the boards, Jefferson has never averaged less than 9.3 rebounds per game since his third year in the league. Jefferson’s ability to impact others’ shots and grab boards has been largely aided by his 7’3 wingspan. While at 289 pounds he is not the quickest on the floor, his huge build almost inherently takes a toll on the opposing players.
One last similarity between the two forwards is their high field goal percentages. Both shoot over 50 percent from the field, forcing opposing defenses to collapse on them in the paint. This opens up the court for their teammates, and ultimately enables them to do what they do best: use their size, hands, and power to control the game.
Through boards, blocks, and bulk, Harvard’s Keith Wright and seven-year NBA veteran Al Jefferson have much in common. Other than the fact that they are each from the South, both players display moves and attitudes on both ends of the court that show their respective aggressive mindsets.
Runners-up: DeAndre Jordan, Samuel Dalembert, Kevin McHale (for the ’80’s fans)
