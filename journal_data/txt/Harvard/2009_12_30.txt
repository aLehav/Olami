After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A small fire broke out in the Cafe of India kitchen on Wednesday at approximately 10:45 a.m., according to Jagdish Singh, one of the owners of the restaurant.
Surinder Singh, a chef who has worked at the restaurant on 52A Brattle St. for 15 years, had turned on a charcoal oven to preheat it for the day's service—as he does every day—when the charcoal ignited a fire that triggered the alarm, according to Jagdish Singh.
Cambridge Fire Department and Cambridge Police Department responded to the alarm at around 11:10 a.m., at which point Jagdish Singh had to discontinue service and close the restaurant for the day.
The charcoal oven, which is used by the restaurant to cook meats and bake bread, was able to contain the fire, but the outpouring smoke rose to the ceiling and damaged it, according to Singh, who said he could not estimate the cost of the repairs. But Cambridge fire inspectors determined that the incident caused $10,000 in damage, the Cambridge Chronicle reported.
The individuals inside the restaurant when the fire broke out were Singh, the chef, the waiters, and the other kitchen staff members, who all went home by 5 p.m.
Wednesday's incident marks the second duct-related fire at Cafe of India in the past two years: in January 2008, a duct fire at the restaurant caused the Cambridge Police to close down Brattle Street.
As a result of the fire, a health inspector will examine the premises on Thursday—Singh said that he hopes to reopen the restaurant as soon as it passes inspection.
According to the online database of food handling inspections maintained by the City of Cambridge, poor ventilation was one of the seven violations that Cafe of India exhibited during its routine inspection in March of 2009.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
2009 was a year the Harvard men’s hockey team wanted to forget. But in its last chance for redemption before the calendar turned, the Crimson ended the year on a good note.
Harvard (2-8-2, 2-5-2 ECAC) snapped a 10-game winless streak with a 3-1 victory over No. 8 Quinnipiac (13-4-1, 7-3-0) last night at Bright Hockey Center.
“I think we’re excited—relieved—to get the victory,” said Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91. “We needed to win to get some of our confidence back, and hopefully we can build off of this.”
Harvard was powered by the scoring efforts of three rookies and the fresh perspective gained from a three-week break from action.
“It was important, invaluable, [considering] the fact that we were beat up a little bit mentally with the losing streak,” Donato said. “It’s tough to really refresh, rejuvenate yourself without stepping away from it.”
Undeterred by the track record of its league-leading opponent, the Crimson got on the board midway through the opening period. Sophomore center Colin Moore took a pass in transition from classmate Ryan Grimshaw and found open ice in a sea of Bobcat jerseys.
Grimshaw’s long shot bounced off Quinnipiac goalie Dan Clarke’s pad, but rookie Luke Greiner picked the puck up in the left circle and found nothing but net for his first career tally.
“I think that whole line—[Moore], Luke Greiner, David Valek—did a great job not only defensively, but offensively [they] were able to create some chances and really outworked whoever they were playing against,” Donato said.
The Crimson carried its momentum into the second period, wasting no time on its first powerplay opportunity. Bobcat defender Brett Dickinson was whistled for interference, and it took just 14 seconds with the extra man for Harvard to find the back of the net.
Freshman Louis Leblanc buried a pass from junior Chris Huxley at 6:50, getting a secondary assist from rookie Alex Fallstrom.
But after Leblanc’s goal, the game took a turn for the more physical. With seven minutes to play in the second, five penalties were called in a span of 30 seconds—the most significant to Quinnipiac senior Eric Lampe, who got a 10-minute major after he threw a punch at a referee.
And after the second intermission, the Bobcats came out playing like the team that was expected to dominate.
With less than three minutes gone in the final period, Quinnipiac sophomore Yuri Bouharevich poked a Greg Holt rebound past Harvard junior netminder Kyle Richter to bring the Bobcats within one, 2-1.
Spencer Heichman nearly evened the score on a breakaway five minutes later, but his shot was stuffed by Richter, who made 36 saves on the evening.
“He was very good on stuff around his crease,” Donato said of his goalie. “He’s a guy that’s got a lot of talent and I think, like everybody else on our team, [he] feels that he can play better than he did the first half. I think he was certainly a difference-maker for us tonight.”
Quinnipiac outshot Harvard, 17-7, in the third on its way to a 37-23 advantage for the game. But despite its late-game dominance, it was too little, too late.
The Bobcats pulled Clarke with just over two minutes to play in a last-ditch attempt to net the equalizer, but although Quinnipiac peppered Richter with shots, the junior held strong.
“Richter just kept making saves and we just couldn’t find our way,” Bobcat coach Rand Pecknold said. “If you want to win in this league, you can’t get behind 2-0 on the road, so it’s our own fault.”
With 44 ticks left on the clock, the rookie Valek gave the Crimson some insurance. The brothers Biega—freshman Danny and captain Alex—moved the puck ahead to Valek skating up the left boards in the neutral zone.
Valek got the puck past a wall of Bobcat defenders, and it slid into the empty net to put the game out of reach at 3-1.
It was the first career goal for Valek, and the assist marked the first career point for Danny Biega.
“Two of our freshmen scored their first career goals, and we’re very excited for them,” Alex Biega said. “But they come to play every day, and that’s an attitude we need to have in our locker room on a consistent basis.”
With its second win—and first since October’s season opener against Dartmouth—under its belt, Harvard hopes that 2010 will signal the beginning of a different kind of streak.
“I think we all feel, from the coaching staff on down, that we can be better,” Donato said. “Tonight’s a nice first step.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There’s no place like home.
The Harvard women’s basketball team is learning that the hard way after losing at Marist, 85-70, Tuesday evening to fall to 0-4 on the road this season.
Although the Crimson (6-4) has posted a perfect 5-0 home record, it couldn’t extend its three-game winning streak against a tough Red Fox squad (8-4) that held Harvard to just 30 points in the first half after the Crimson had been averaging 83 points per game during its win streak.
On the other side of the ball, Marist posted 50 points on 60.6-percent shooting from the field in the first half en route to a 20-point halftime lead.
“We weren’t communicating well on defense in the first half at all,” junior co-captain Claire Wheeler said. “Our turnovers led to too many points, and poor communication led them to a lot of open shots.”
The Red Foxes certainly found many open shots while picking apart the Crimson defense, connecting on 7-of-12 from three-point range in the first half.
Harvard fought from behind for most of the early going, but managed to cut its deficit to 23-20 before Marist used runs of 11-3 and 16-3 to solidify a strong lead going into the break.
The Crimson would outscore the Red Foxes, 40-35, in the second half but would never get closer than a 66-58 deficit following a three-pointer by junior co-captain Christine Matera, who posted a career-high 19 points in the contest. Junior Emma Markley added 16 points and 13 rebounds for her fourth-straight double-double of the season.
“I think we definitely fought in the second half to come back, but we just didn’t play with enough consistency throughout the game,” Markley said. “We need to work on playing through the entire game.”
Although it’s still early in the season, Harvard’s road woes are becoming notable—the Crimson is allowing 80.5 points per game on the road this year compared to just under 70 points per game at home.
“I wouldn’t really say we’re a different team on the road,” Markley said.  “We may naturally play with a little more confidence at home, but I wouldn’t say it’s something noticeable.”
Whatever the reason for its road performance, Harvard has little time to right the ship before conference play begins.
After returning to Lavietes Pavilion to host Navy this Saturday, Harvard rounds out its non-conference slate with a four-game road trip that includes visits to UMass and Florida State.
“We’re aware of [our road struggles], but we don’t really look to make that excuse,” Wheeler said.  “It doesn’t matter whether we’re home or away, we just need to be more consistent and expect to bring the same level of intensity to each and every game.”

Whoever thought a seemingly innocent Harvard-Yale shirt wouldn't be found offensive by so many people was wrong. Yes, it's the end of December, we've already claimed victory, and yet we're still talking about those shirts. Well, one shirt in particular.
While you were waiting in the bitter cold line for that free "FALE" shirt in November, our Yale compatriots rivals were debating whether a "Sissy" shirt should be printed at all.
The design in question read "'I think of all of Harvard men as sissies.' - F. Scott Fitzgerald," on the front, and "We Agree. The Game 2009" on the back. The characters in This Side of Paradise, from which the quotation was taken, were discussing the merits of Princeton, where Fitzergerald himself was an alum.
So what's the problem? Read more after the jump.
After the Yale Freshman Class Council (FCC) announced this design as the winner of a class-wide vote, some concerns were raised by the Yale LGBT Cooperative about the derogatory use of the word "sissy." Then the administration was consulted and more voting took place, and the shirt design, as reported by the Yale Daily News on Nov. 19, was pulled. A boring H in a circle with a line through it would take its place.
But now, about a month after the YDN story, Adam L. H. Kissel '94, Director of the Individual Rights Defense Program at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), wrote a letter to Yale President Richard C. Levin, requesting assurance that the infringement upon students' right to speech would never happen again.
"The root problem from FIRE's perspective," Kissel told FlyBy, "is that it was a decision by an administrator."
According to the YDN story, the pulling of the shirt was done at the urging of one of the deans whom the FCC had consulted. Kissel asked for a response by Jan. 12, 2010, the date of the Harvard-Yale hockey game.
"It was not really different from other shirts that I've seen through the years," Kissel said. "They were trying to be offensive to Harvard students in general and not to the queer community."
But Christian L. Garland '10-'11, co-chair of the Harvard Queer Student Association Students and Allies, said he disagrees.
"Creating a shirt about sissies is not, in my opinion, an effective way to create conversation," said Garland, a women and gender studies women, gender, and sexuality studies concentrator who even says Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby is one of his favorite books. "I'm glad that the University banned it."
The controversy has left FlyBy wondering what all the commotion was about in the first place. Here's what we researched—and we'll let you decide.
Exhibit A: Urban Dictionary's most popular definition for "sissy" is "weak," while the second definition says it's "not always straight or gay."
Exhibit B: Merriam Webster defines the word as "an effeminate man or boy," but also more generally, "a timid or cowardly person."
Exhibit C: Barney Wiki says that BJ (the yellow one) calls his sister Baby Bop (the green one) "Sissy."
Why can't we all just love each other like Barney says?
