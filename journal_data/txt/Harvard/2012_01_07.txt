After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just days after an upset at the hands of Fordham, No. 21/22 Harvard men's basketball looked like it might suffer its second embarrassing loss in as many games.
In the Ivy League opener, the Crimson (13-2, 1-0 Ivy) went into halftime up by just one over Dartmouth (3-13, 0-1), the heavy underdog.
And at the start of the second half, the Big Green pushed its lead to as many as seven. For the second straight game, Harvard had trouble finding the basket, and the team was in danger of dropping its first home game since 2010.
But as it has done so many times this year, the Crimson mounted a second-half comeback, this time on the shoulders of co-captain Oliver McNally, to easily defeat Dartmouth, 63-47.
With Harvard down by seven with 16 minutes to play, Big Green freshman Galbas Maldunas missed a layup inside. Junior guard Brandyn Curry picked up the rebound, and McNally hit an open three to pull the Crimson back to within four points.
“I kind of felt the momentum swing when they were up [by seven],” McNally said. “They missed a layup, somewhat contested. Somehow, we got a rebound … and Brandyn hit me for a three. It was a big five-point swing there.”
About three minutes later, McNally hit another three-point shot to narrow Dartmouth’s lead to one, and Harvard took the lead on the next possession on a Curry layup. The Crimson maintained the advantage for the rest of the afternoon.
“[Oliver]’s had a knack for [timely baskets] since he’s been here as a player,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “He’s a kid that’s thrived on pressure moments and big shots.”
After poor shooting against Fordham cost the team its first loss in almost a month, the same problem plagued Harvard in the first half. The Crimson scored only 23 points in the frame.
Junior Kyle Casey led the team in the early minutes of the game, but after scoring Harvard’s first seven, Casey only scored three more in the rest of the game.  Casey and co-captain Keith Wright, two of the team’s leading scorers, combined for 20 points on the afternoon.
The team had its share of struggles on the defensive end as well. Dartmouth picked up eight offensive rebounds in the first half, and the Big Green had a possession that lasted almost two minutes at the end of the frame because of two offensive boards and a foul on Wright.
“We’re in a little funk. We’re putting too much pressure on ourselves,” McNally said. “The first half, defensively, you take out a couple of those offensive rebounds, and you only scored 22 points, with a late shot.”
The Crimson had much more success on the glass in the second half, and after Dartmouth’s strong showing in the first, the team did not have any offensive rebounds in the final 20 minutes of the game. Maldunas, who had five offensive and eight total rebounds in the first half, only had one board in the second.
Up by one, Harvard struggled out of the gate in the second half, and an 8-0 run by the Big Green gave the visitors their largest lead of the day.
“They were up against us early in the second half, and that’s where I thought our kids really dug in and got the stops,” Amaker said. “Our pace improved once we were able to get some defensive stops.”
Led by McNally and his pair of scores from behind the arc, the Crimson opened up a 16-2 run that included a pair of three-pointers from sophomore Laurent Rivard, who seemed to find his stroke towards the end of the game after struggling against Fordham and in the first half against Dartmouth.
“Laurent’s threes are big baskets for our team,” Amaker said. “We count on him, and it could have been a relief with all of us to see him bury a few. I think our team can lift tremendously when he’s been that big-shot guy.”
As the home team pulled ahead—Harvard outscored the Big Green in the final 16 minutes, 36-13—the sellout crowd at Lavietes came alive, and the Crimson finished off a Dartmouth squad that wasn't expected to compete.
“Kids seem to bounce back—that’s the beauty of being young,” Amaker said of the team’s attitude after the loss to Fordham. “That’s one thing they can usually teach us in situations like that, to move on.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the first 20 minutes of the Harvard men’s basketball team’s matchup with Dartmouth on Saturday, it looked like a repeat of Tuesday’s upset loss at Fordham was in the works.
At the half, the Crimson led by just one, 23-22, and Harvard’s offense couldn’t find an answer for the Big Green’s zone defense.
The Crimson was shooting just 3-of-10 from beyond the arc, and co-captain Keith Wright, who finished with just eight points against Fordham, was held to two first-half points on two shots. Harvard was also getting crushed on the boards, 17-12, and had surrendered eight offensive rebounds to the Big Green.
Before any of the Crimson’s assistant coaches got a chance to address the team inside the locker room, it was co-captain Oliver McNally who took charge.
“From a vocal standpoint, I thought he was outstanding,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “He was being pretty adamant about what we needed to do and how we were going to do it and who needed to step forward.”
“It wasn’t a good tone,” McNally said.
Whatever adjustments he called for—and however he said it—seemed to have the desired effect, as the Crimson outscored the Big Green, 40-25, in the second half.
Harvard made a point of establishing Wright early, going to the forward on its first three trips up the floor. Wright connected on his first two attempts of the period and finished the half shooting 4-of-6.
“We were able to get up the floor much quicker [in the second half],” Amaker said. “I thought we were able to get deeper post position earlier.”
In addition to getting Wright more involved, the Crimson also started to dominate the glass in the second half. After surrendering eight offensive rebounds in the first period, Harvard allowed none in the second, and outrebounded the Big Green, 16-10, in the frame.
“If we rebound the basketball and take care of it, we’re going to win a lot of games,” McNally said. “I’m pretty disappointed we weren’t able to put a more complete game together, but I’ll take a 16-point win in the Ivy League.”
A FRESH CHALLENGER 
The Crimson cannot be too excited about the fact that it will have to face Gabas Maldunas seven more times over the next four years.
The Dartmouth freshman scrapped his way to a 15-point, nine-rebound performance—both team highs—against the Crimson. The 6’8 rookie proved difficult for the Harvard bigs to stop in the post, as he was able to put the ball on the deck and use his long arms to finish layups. He was also active on the glass, finishing with five offensive boards.
“He’s got quick feet for a 6’8 kid,” Amaker said of Maldunas. “He puts it on the floor. He got around our guys. He uses either hand. I think he’s a tremendous player. He’s a tough matchup for post players, and we knew that coming in.”
Maldunas entered Saturday’s contest averaging 9.1 points—good for 20th in the Ivy League and tops among all rookies—and 6.8 rebounds—fifth in the Ivy League and best among freshmen.
The Lithuanian has been on a tear as of late, scoring in double figures and posting at least nine rebounds in Dartmouth’s last three games.
But it was not all fun and games for Maldunas on Saturday. He shot 6-of-15 from the field and committed a team high three turnovers. And in one crucial sequence early in the second half, Maldunas blew a layup and McNally knocked down a three-pointer while the Big Green scrambled back on defense, cutting Dartmouth’s lead from a possible nine points to four.
“We got a rebound, kind of had a run out, and Brandyn [Curry] hit me for three; It was a big five-point swing,” McNally said. “Dartmouth is going to wish they had that one back, but we’re not going to point to one play. I think our overall defensive performance in the second half was a lot better.”
A FAMILIAR FOE 
Entering Saturday’s matchup with a 3-12 record, the Big Green may not have seemed like a tough matchup for the two-loss Crimson. But based on past experience, Harvard knew it could not take Dartmouth lightly.
Last season, the Big Green came to Lavietes Pavilion with a 4-11 record and led the 12-3 Crimson by 12 points early in the second half before Harvard came back to win by nine.
The year before, Harvard had to battle back from an 11-point deficit midway through the first half before capturing a four-point win at Dartmouth’s Leede Arena.
And during the 2008-09 season, McNally—then a freshman—saved the Crimson from suffering a pair of losses to the Big Green when he stuck a 12-foot runner to give Harvard a one-point win.
McNally, who has gone 6-1 against Dartmouth during his Crimson career, will get one last shot against the Big Green when Harvard visits Leede on Jan. 21.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its first action of 2012, the Harvard wrestling team defeated Rider, 22-15, but fell to No. 24 Rutgers in a lopsided 33-12 contest on Friday in East Brunswick, N.J.
With its victory over Rider (4-3), the Crimson (1-1, 0-1 EIWA) broke its losing streak of five dual matchups, which stretches back to the 2010-11 season.
Co-captain Corey Jantzen returned to competition after he had sat out the past two semesters due to injury. Jantzen earned victories in both of his matchups, including a win in overtime against No. 3 Mario Mason of Rutgers.
No. 5 junior co-captain Walter Peppelman also saw action again after suffering an injury at the Cliff Keen Las Vegas Invitational, picking up two wins by pinning both of his opponents. The two pins gave Peppelman 20 in his career.
“I thought we wrestled well against Rider,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said. “Shifting from tournament competition to dual meet is a big difference, so I thought the guys responded well…It was nice to get the first win, and I wish we would have wrestled that way against Rutgers, but it’s still a good start.”
RUTGERS 33, HARVARD 12
Despite suffering its first loss of the season at the hands of Rutgers (7-1), three Harvard wrestlers turned in winning performances to maintain a perfect record for the day.
Jantzen notched the biggest upset of the day when he topped the previously unbeaten Mason in overtime, 7-6. With the win, Jantzen improved his career record to 42-18.
“He was down, but then came back and just controlled the whole bout,” Weiss said. “That just shows a lot about where he’s at, and he’s just going to get better.”
Mason jumped out to an early 4-0 lead in the second period, but Jantzen earned an escape and a takedown to close in on his opponent and shave the lead down to just one point. After both wrestlers failed to score in sudden victory, Jantzen finished the comeback by with an escape and takedown to top the Scarlet Knight grappler.
No. 13 Keith also notched another win for the Crimson at 133 lbs. by beating Michael DeMarco of Rutgers, 2-0. DeMarco had previously defeated Keith’s fellow teammate, freshman Ryan Osleeb, at the Midlands Championships last week in a 14-2 major decision. After the Crimson forfeited the first bout at 125 lbs, Keith’s victory halved the Scarlet Knight’s six-point advantage.
Peppelman was the only other Harvard wrestler to earn a win in action against Rutgers. Peppelman pinned Dave Seidenberg of Rutgers at 1:38 to seal his 11th victory of the season. The win tied the score at 12-12, but the Scarlet Knights would go on to win the next five matchups to clinch the dual match in a decisive fashion.
HARVARD 22, RIDER 15
The Crimson scored its first victory of the season with six wrestlers winning their bouts, one by major decision and another by fall. Jantzen came strong in his first matchup in a year, sailing to victory in a 10-0 major decision over Connor Brennan. Jantzen earned four takedowns en route to his win, two in the first period and one in each of the second and third periods.
After Harvard forfeited the matchup at 125 lbs., Keith notched a 4-1 decision over Jimmy Morris to decrease the deficit to 6-3. Keith’s win brought his career record to 60-35, though he would tack on another victory later in the day against DeMarco.
Trailing 9-7 in the overall score, Peppelman put Harvard back in the lead by scoring his first of two falls for the weekend, pinning Ramon Santiago at 1:09. With the win, the Crimson moved into the lead, 13-9.
“I feel like I wrestled pretty well,” Peppelman said. “I wasn’t sure I was ready and my coaches did a good job of pushing me to wrestle those two matches. They were good wins for me and they helped build my confidence back up.”
Yet Rider pulled ahead once again with victories at 165 lbs. and 174 lbs. The Crimson rebounded and sealed the matchup by winning the final three bouts. Sophomore Cameron Croy earned a decision over Brandon Lintner, 10-4, and increased his career record to 25-26. Freshman James Fox pulled out another 4-0 decision against Donald McNeil, and heavyweight freshman David Ng finished off the dual by edging Evan Craig, 3-2.
According to Weiss, the Crimson still needs to improve to win against some of the competition it will face this season. But after finishing last year with a 2-15 record, a win early on is certainly welcome for Harvard.
“It’s not where we want to be, but we’re getting there, that’s for sure,” Weiss said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It truly is the most wonderful time of the year. On Dec. 25, we all shared in a gift that is way better than any Christmas sweater or box of chocolates. Yep, professional basketball is back. To ring in the good times, we at The Back Page have set out to find the best NBA match for several of Harvard’s own ballers. Which NBA player is most like each Crimson star? Keep reading to find out.
Oliver McNally – 7.9 PPG, 3.5 APG, 2.3 RPG (2011-2012 season)
During his junior season, McNally ranked second nationally in free-throw percentage, shooting 92.6 percent from the line, setting a single season record for the Crimson. Over the last three seasons, McNally has shot 44.6 percent from the field and 37 percent from beyond the arc. But McNally’s leadership has made as much, if not more, of an impact on his team than his physical play. As Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker said, “[His role] is invaluable. …Without his heart and soul, we’re not where we’ve been in the past, and we’re certainly not where we want to go in the future.” Which NBA player possesses a similar skill set to McNally?
Chauncey Billups – 15.5 PPG, 5.6 APG, 2.9 RPG (Career)
In his early days of pre-Detroit Piston basketball, Billups played a role very similar to that of McNally. He was a guard whose success centered on his slick jump shot rather than defensive quickness. In terms of his free-throw proficiency, Billups is 13th all time on the NBA postseason made free-throw lists with 776 makes to his name. His career average now ranks among the best at 89.4 percent. Along with his more than steady shooting, Billups has been a leader for every team that he has played on since the start of his career. Whether it was guiding his talented, yet somewhat rowdy, Pistons team to the 2004 NBA Championship, or acting as a stabilizing force for the offensively oriented New York Knicks last season, Billups has remained a rock for his teammates and coaching staff.
Both Oliver McNally and Chauncey Billups have used offensive efficiency, dead-eye accuracy, and strong leadership to guide their teams during their respective careers. Each relies heavily on his shot to anchor his play on the offensive end, while also counting on his vocal ability to support his teammates.
To just call one of these guards great for his shooting skills would be to close a book before the very end. What makes McNally and Billups stand out from the crowd is their shared ability to lead, direct, and serve as a role model for their teammates—and doing so while never forgetting to hold their follow through from the foul line.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a one-win, one-loss performance at Rutgers on Friday, the Harvard wrestling team showed no signs of weariness as it won back-to-back contests over Millersville and Franklin & Marshall on Saturday afternoon in Lancaster, Pa.
The Crimson (3-1) opened the day with a 43-0 drubbing of Millersville. Four Harvard wrestlers pinned their opponents, and twice the pins came in under two minutes.  Franklin & Marshall would not be ousted so easily, but the Crimson battled to a 29-12 victory to stay perfect on the day.
The meet, hosted by Franklin & Marshall, marked a homecoming for Harvard head coach Jay Weiss, who graduated from the school in 1990 after a prolific wrestling career of his own.
The meet also marked only the second day of wrestling for Crimson co-captain Corey Jantzen following two semesters missed due to injury. The senior showed little rust despite the long layoff, pinning his first opponent and earning a major decision over his second with an 11-0 win.
“A couple nerves crept in,” Jantzen said, “but it’s a lot of fun to be back.”
Fellow co-captain junior Walter Peppelman continued a dominant weekend that began on Friday. Peppelman’s two quick pins on Saturday give him four straight, with all but his final win over Franklin & Marshall’s Eric Norgard taking no more than two minutes.
“Everyone performed really well. The younger guys stepped up,” Janzten said. “Everybody wrestled to their potential.”
HARVARD 29, FRANKLIN & MARSHALL 12
Franklin & Marshall (0-10) earned six points for a forfeit victory at 125 pounds, but that would prove the high point for the Diplomats as Harvard would take six of the seven remaining matches.
Crimson junior Stephen Keith earned his fourth win in two days with a major decision over Robert Ruiz to close the deficit. Franklin & Marshall grappler Richard Durso earned a decision over Harvard freshman Patrick Hogan at 141 pounds, but thereafter the Crimson took control.
Janzten took a major decision over Andrew Murano, followed by consecutive pins from Peppelman and junior Paul Liguori at 157 and 167 pounds, respectively.
Franklin & Marshall’s Matt Fullowan briefly interrupted the Crimson’s streak with a win at 174 pounds, but Harvard responded with three consecutive wins to seal the victory.
Sophomore Cameron Croy won a decision, 10-4, over Matt Latessa at 184 pounds, and freshmen James Fox and David Ng capped the Crimson win with victories at 197 and 285 pounds, respectively.
“We had a couple matches that didn’t go our way, but overall I think everyone stepped up and competed really well,” Jantzen said.
HARVARD 43, MILLERSVILLE 0
Harvard began the day with a resounding victory over the Marauders (1-3). The dominant performance was highlighted by four pins by Crimson grapplers, one coming from Peppelman only 43 seconds into his match.
Millersville forfeited the 133 lb. match, giving junior Steven Keith the automatic win and Harvard a quick 6-0 lead.
The Crimson’s Patrick Hogan opened the action with a narrow 8-7 win over Millersville’s Josh Ruppert, earning the freshman his first collegiate victory.
In the 149-lb. match, Jantzen cruised to a fall-pin over Daniel Calzarette just before the four-minute mark. Peppelman followed up with a pin of his own at 157, making quick work of the Maurader’s Zac Wawrzyniak-Bush and ending the match in less than a minute’s time.
Liguori kept the momentum going with a 4-2 decision over Millersville senior Brandon Vernalli, the junior’s 11th win on the season.  Josh Popple, wrestling in his first collegiate match, pinned senior Shane Smith to seal a win for the Crimson with three matches still to come.
Harvard continued to pour it on as it swept the final three matches. In the 184-lb. weight class, Croy pinned his senior opponent in 83 seconds, and Fox followed that up with a 12-3 major decision over Joel Suter.
The most closely contested match of the meet came in the heavyweights, as David Ng capped off Harvard’s victory with a 6-4 overtime win to topple Millersville senior Brad Ladd.
The Crimson has the week to rest before traveling to Arlington, Texas next weekend, where it will take on the likes of Air Force and No. 9 Oklahoma.
“It’s always been a great trip for us,” Weiss said. “It will be a great opportunity for us to face top competition.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its final game before the Ivy League season begins, the Harvard women's basketball team ended its non-conference schedule on a high note, topping Texas Christian University, 56-44, on Saturday at the Daniel-Meyer Coliseum in Fort Worth, Texas.
"I thought the game went really well for us," captain Brogan Berry said. "We came out the first half with great energy especially on the defensive end. I think we really set TCU back...I don't think they were expecting us to run with them as well [as we did]."
With the victory, the Crimson (7-6) is now 2-0 in 2012.
"We've been saying, 'new year, new Harv,'" junior Victoria Lippert said. "We've really just been trying to dial in our defensive presence … and really take our game to the next level mentally and with our execution."
This marked the first contest between the Horned Frogs (7-8) and Harvard since Dec. 6, 1992, when TCU topped the Crimson, 80-72.
Harvard took charge of the first half, running its lead to 12 by halftime. Thirteen of its 30 points came from Berry, who hit three shots from beyond the arc in the half. Harvard led the frame in shots from the floor, scoring 11 of its 25 shots, while the Horned Frogs only made 6 out of 23 for a lowly 26.1 percent.
Harvard also took advantage of Horned Frog miscues, scoring 16 points off of the 10 TCU first-half turnovers.
"I think the combination of our defense being really strong, being tough, and us pushing the ball early and quick really set them back. [It] allowed us to get an early lead that we were able to hold onto for the rest of the game," Berry said.
TCU upped its game in the second half, turning the ball over just five times. Yet, the Horned Frogs still struggled shooting, going just 8-of-36 from the field, and Harvard continued to capitalize on TCU errors, scoring six points on the five turnovers.
"[Our defense] enabled us to really get our offense going, too," Berry said. "So I think most of our game starts from our defense. It enabled us to push the ball early and have a comfortable and easy offense."
By the end of the frame, Harvard and TCU had each scored 26 points, but that wasn't enough for the Horned Frogs to overtake the Crimson's previous lead. Harvard's strong defense kept the status quo of the first frame—a 12-point gap between the two squads.
At the sound of the buzzer, the Crimson kept its “new Harv” appearance, topping the hosts by a comfortable margin.
"[Our strength] was our mental preparation and executing defensively on the court,” Lippert said. “[We were] just playing tough through the whole game, working on our team's strategy, and just continuing our defensive presence and effort for the whole 40 minutes."
Brogan led both teams in scoring, going 5-for-10 from the field and hitting four of her seven free throws to give her 17 points in the contest. With the performance, the senior now has 1,236 career points and moved to tenth on the Harvard all-time scoring list, passing Sarah Duncan ’89 by eight points.
"It's a huge accomplishment that I'm very proud of," Berry said. "[The program] has given me a great role all four years, and great coaching with Kathy and my teammates in the past have enabled me to play the game that I love. And in doing that I'm able to reach some milestones...that are amazing to achieve."
Lippert and Clark also had strong evenings for Harvard, with each racking up 13 points in the game. Sophomore Missy Mullins also had a good showing, starting for the first time in her Crimson career. She earned a career high and set the game high with 10 rebounds.
"TCU was a very talented team," Berry said. "Very athletic, very good rebounders. I think we're coming into the new year with a new attitude. We had a couple slip-ups in the first half of the season, and I think the last two games with UMass and TCU have really prepared us for Ivies, which are right around the corner."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team might want to try its hand at an art class, because it’s become quite good at drawing.
The Crimson (4-4-6, 3-3-4 ECAC) tied its fifth game in seven contests Saturday night, rallying in the third period for the second straight evening to earn a 2-2 draw against Rensselaer (3-16-1, 1-7-1) at Houston Field House.
Freshman Colin Blackwell scored an acrobatic game-tying goal in the third to complete a two-score rally for Harvard, which avoided leaving Troy, N.Y. without a point against the conference’s last-place team.
“I think we played well,” junior forward Alex Fallstrom said. “They got two lucky goals which kind of interrupted our momentum. We had to come from behind and do a pretty serious comeback once again, similar to the one in the game against Union.”
Just as it did Friday night against the No. 14 Dutchmen, the Crimson started slowly against the Engineers, who scored two times in just 26 seconds in the sixth minute of the contest.
First, center Zach Schroeder deflected right wing Marty O’Grady’s right-point shot past Harvard freshman goalie Steve Michalek. After the subsequent faceoff, RPI intercepted a Crimson breakout pass attempt at center ice, setting up a door-step goal by right wing C.J. Lee.
“They got kind of a lucky bounce on the first one; it hit off the guy’s shin pad,” Michalek said.  “But those are going to happen and since it was early in the game, they got a bit of a momentum boost from that and they came right at us.”
“[Allowing back-to-back goals] is something we’ve got to work on in the future,” he added. “We’ve been doing that a lot in past games, which can kind of be a killer.”
After RPI’s Mike Bergin was called for holding under two minutes later, senior forward Eric Kroshus cut the Engineer lead in half, giving the Crimson—which owns the top power play in the nation—a man-up goal for the 18th straight game. Blackwell redirected a point shot by sophomore defenseman Danny Ford on net, and Kroshus snagged the rebound and patiently beat Engineer goalie Scott Diebold to the top half of the goal.
The teams remained scoreless for the rest of the period, despite Harvard holding a 12-4 edge in shots. In the second, the Crimson defense did not allow an RPI shot for the first 13 minutes of the period, blocking 10 Engineer attempts while outshooting RPI by a 9-1 margin.
“It was kind of a frustrating game,” Michalek said. “They really didn’t generate much offense at all; we really took it to them. ... I think that says a lot about our defense and how we were really able to shut them down the whole game and limit their chances.”
The Crimson found an equalizer 1:34 into the third, when Blackwell beat Diebold to tie things up.
“[Blackwell] came in on the right side on a three-on-two,” Fallstrom explained. “He kind of fumbled the puck, then recovered it, spun around, and put a backhander under the goalie’s arm. So it was a really nice goal, and it was an important goal for us. Obviously it tied the game and gave us momentum to get back in it and go for the win.”
But the Crimson was unable to pick up the go-ahead score after that, with Rensselaer killing a Harvard man-up chance late in the third. A strong Harvard shift of Blackwell, junior Luke Greiner, and classmate David Valek was unable to find the back of the net in overtime, ending the game in a tie.
“I thought it was a good effort,” Michalek said. “We definitely dominated the whole game; you can tell by the shot totals. We would’ve liked to come out with a win, but I thought we can take a lot of positives out of it and carry momentum from the way we played into the next game.”
Michalek finished with 11 saves, while senior forward Alex Killorn led the Crimson with five shots. Diebold had 25 saves for RPI, which won 31 of 54 faceoffs and snapped a six-game losing streak.
“Even though we didn’t win, I think we took a step in the right direction,” Fallstrom said. “It really showed that this team has a lot of character, and we’re going to be able to win some big games in the future.”
