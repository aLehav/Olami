After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Puzzled Netflix users have surely been scratching their heads in earnest as they’ve considered watching “Tall Girl,” the new movie on their Trending Now list. Its enigmatic title is understandably baffling, so to alleviate any confusion, here is some clarification: “Tall Girl” is about — and this may come as a shock — a tall girl. And that’s really the extent of its depth.
Directed by Nzingha Stewart, the Netflix Original teen rom-com released on Sept. 13 follows 6-foot-one-and-a-half-inch high school junior Jodi (Ava Michelle), and the trials and tribulations that stem from her height related insecurities. Jodi’s life gets interesting when handsome Swedish exchange student Stig (Luke Eisner) — who is taller than her — comes to her school, and she and popular girl Kimmy Stitcher (Clara Wilsey) vie for his attention. What ensues is an unrealistic and formulaic plot laden with clichés, making “Tall Girl” feel less like a feel-good rom-com and more like Netflix’s attempt to see how low audience standards are when it comes to consuming vacuous and predictable content.
“Tall Girl” features all the classic stereotypes that define teen films — love triangles, makeovers, and mean popular kids — and exaggerates them to the point of ludicrosity. The lack of originality, paired with the fact that the entire film centers around her height, leads one to wonder if there was some intentional irony built into the plot. Perhaps “Tall Girl” is purposefully making fun of the superficiality of makeovers and the often vapid nature of teenage drama. Jodi tries to catch Stig’s attention by getting her pageant girl sister (Sabrina Carpenter) to give her a makeover, the main feature of which seems to involve taking her hair out of her perpetual high ponytail. But unfortunately, it’s unlikely that this film is a self-aware satirical piece.
Before “Tall Girl” was even released, the trailer was met with harsh criticism on social media platforms. The premise of a tall, thin, and objectively pretty white girl feeling oppressed by her height, in a society where tall Eurocentric models are the standard of beauty, perhaps feels insensitive to more marginalized groups that are less represented in the media. “You think your life is hard? I’m a high school junior wearing size 13 Nikes” is a standout line from the movie that exemplifies this privilege. The fact that Jodi constantly gripes about her insecurity makes it difficult to inspire much sympathy for her.
Aside from the controversy about representation or the exaggerated gravity of her struggle, the film’s plot lacks real substance. Most scenes elicit nothing more than a cringe and the thought that such things would never happen in real life — far more than other teen films do. There are countless tall jokes aimed at Jodi, to the point of ludicrousness; would an attractive girl really face that much harassment every day for being the height of a runway model? Jodi is asked “How’s the weather up there?” 10 times a day; this is somehow hard to believe, which takes away from the legitimacy of the plot.
“Tall Girl,” while extremely cheesy and almost unwatchable, is not entirely without merit. Jodi is flanked by two quirky but loyal best friends: the sassy, encouraging, and refreshingly confident Fareeda (Anjelika Washington), and the short but lovable Jack (Griffin Gluck), who is, of course, hopelessly in love with Jodi. Fareeda and Jack are witty and emotive characters, and make the movie more bearable by showing audiences what genuine friendship looks like. Some jokes do land, like Jack’s Gordon Ramsay impression, or Stig’s confused reaction to the attention he gets at school because he was somehow a “dork” in his home country. None of the acting in “Tall Girl” is as cringeworthy as the plot — in fact, each actor falls into their assigned stereotype rather effortlessly, and 17-year-old Ava Michelle is a convincing actress, showing promise despite the one dimensional writing of her character given that Jodi’s entire personality is being tall.
Beyond its sporadic humor, the film’s message is clear, and an important one at that: The journey to find self love, while difficult in our society, is an essential part of coming of age, and is one that all young people can identify with. The theme of “Tall Girl” is evident and meaningful, but the omnipresent clichés and Jodi’s lack of relatability make it less accessible.
“Tall Girl” is a funny watch because of its unrealistic plot, but deep down, anyone who watches this movie knows that Netflix would have been better off putting “Tall Girl”’s budget toward the “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before” sequels.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Has there been a gaping hole in your chest ever since you finished binging the latest season of “Stranger Things”? Good news: The newest season of the anthology series “American Horror Story” might just tide over your cravings for mildly spooky, retro summer vibes — as long as you don’t mind the lack of an engaging plot.
Set in the ‘80s, “AHS: 1984” follows a ragtag group of friends comprised of innocent good-girl Brooke Thompson (Emma Roberts), sultry sex icon Montana Duke (Billie Lourd), peppy aerobics instructor Xavier Plympton (Cody Fern), eye-candy jock Chet Clancy (Gus Kenworthy), and fun-loving Ray Powell (DeRon Horton), who is also the sole man of color in an overwhelmingly white cast. In the season premiere, “Camp Redwood,” the clique of walking stereotypes takes a road trip to a secluded summer retreat called Camp Redwood where they’ve all secured jobs as camp counselors. Soon, however, the friends suspect that the local psycho known as Mr. Jingles (John Carroll Lynch) who killed an entire cabin of campers at Redwood 14 years ago might be on the loose again after escaping from a mental institution, and this time, he’s hunting them. Stuffed with so many references to classic horror movies that it strangles any potential for originality, “AHS: 1984” is a desperate attempt to ride the coattails of “Halloween” and “Friday the 13th” back to relevance under a poor guise of paying homage.
The clever cinematography of the opening scene of “Camp Redwood” admittedly sets a promisingly creepy tone, even if the rest of the episode struggles to live up to it. In the scene, three teens are sprawled in the same bunk, trying to have sex without being caught by their counselors. Although one of the girls repeatedly asserts that she hears a strange noise nearby, she eventually brushes off her fears and begins pulling her shirt over her head — in this moment, the perspective suddenly switches from an impersonal third-person angle into the point of view of this potential victim, effectively increasing audience investment despite the cheesy premise. The movement of the shirt across the audience’s field of vision serves as a brilliantly suspenseful transition sequence leading to the reveal of Mr. Jingles. Unfortunately, the majority of cinematic techniques employed after the opening scene are much less creative: Director Bradley Buecker resorts to typical horror tactics like focusing the camera on the dark background rather than the characters at the forefront to signal a sinister presence, or taking brief, close shots that capture sudden movements.
The generally uninventive cinematography is only one symptom of a broader problem — “American Horror Story” has taken a turn towards overdramatic slasher comedy, and it’s no longer concerned with being genuinely scary. Gratuitous gore fills an inordinate amount of screen time in “Camp Redwood,” from slow pans over bloody, dead bodies scattering the floor of a cabin to close-ups of Mr. Jingles’ hands as he cuts off his victims’ ears and strings them onto a keychain. The abundance of gore used to show off the killer’s modus operandi comes off as such an obvious effort to make Mr. Jingles intimidating that he unwittingly becomes a caricature instead. Villains of successful horror productions thrive off of ominous ambiguity as to why they’re a threat, because the unknown is more unsettling than any one specific characteristic. One of the biggest failings of “AHS: 1984” is that it gives too much away about its antagonist from the get-go, and no amount of good acting or post-production edits can salvage the tension (or lack thereof) that is so crucial to the horror genre.
“American Horror Story” seems to be self-aware of its failings and tries to rejuvenate the plot to no avail by including an assortment of distractions like ’80s paraphernalia and even a bland secondary villain. For one thing, “AHS: 1984” doesn’t smoothly integrate ’80s nostalgia into its plot as much as it shoves flamboyant, retro stereotypes into the audience’s faces. The aerobics class scene and slang like “rad” can be excused, but the show crosses the line into trying too hard with its use of neon pink font to indicate changes in setting and to flash each character’s name when they first appear, as if “American Horror Story” were a boy-band music video rather than a TV series. For another thing, introducing the real-life criminal known as the Night Stalker as a second antagonist alongside the fictional Mr. Jingles in the same episode seems like a last-ditch effort to up the stakes, because the more the scarier, right? In fact, the Night Stalker’s presence thins out the audience’s attention across these two competing plotlines and undermines the importance of Mr. Jingles, a character that’s already fairly unimposing.
The bottom line? “American Horror Story: 1984” doesn’t have the finesse to pay tribute to staples of the horror genre without losing its own identity. In an attempt to dress up the uninspired content of the season premiere, director Bradley Buecker relies on dozens of cheap tricks — gore, jump-scares, nostalgia, the remnants of positive opinion of “American Horror Story” left over from earlier seasons — much like a chef who overturns the seasoning canisters into a dish to hide how undercooked it is. Go ahead and give “AHS: 1984” a try if you’re into goofy horror and happen to have some free time on your hands, but certainly don’t carve time out of your schedule every week just to tune in.

The College recently announced that Peer Advising Fellows may no longer advise their advisees on academic matters. The administration stated the decision was made in order to transition to a better freshman advising program in the future, where academic advisers would receive more “intensive training.”  This announcement raised some concerns among PAFs and the larger Harvard community, and immediately startled me, lowering my expectations for the efficacy of freshman mentorship going forward. Most importantly, this change to the advising system highlights an under-reported inequality on Harvard’s campus: network inequality.
The new limitations on freshman advising from PAFs are ill-advised because they eliminates a major equalizer: the PAF academic network. This decision has the unintended consequence of disadvantaging students who need PAF guidance the most and highlights the upper hand given to students entering Harvard with a preexisting network of social connections.
How does PAFing help make a more equitable Harvard? It bolsters students’ academic and social networks on campus, regardless of the number of Harvard students they know upon arrival. This safety net is essential to students attending Harvard without any friends or acquaintances already at the College. Before coming to Harvard as a freshman, I did not have any close relationships with any other students. I did not have the slightest idea about what classes would be like, what the social life entailed, and what resources to access if I needed different kinds of support. Harvard, as far as I was concerned, was a different country (though just 20 minutes away from my childhood home).
I assumed that most other freshmen would arrive with the same doubts and ignorance that I had. However, I was stunned to find out that there was a network of Harvard expertise flowing to many of my peers through their siblings, their elite prep school classmates, and their athletic teammates. Many of my new peers had deep connections here, and they handled Opening Days and Shopping Week with relative ease. To my surprise, however, I soon discovered many of my peers already knew how to lottery for classes and take  placement exams. Meanwhile, I clumsily explored course catalogues and tried to decipher the General Education system and concentration requirements.
Though this information asymmetry was discouraging, it was substantially remedied by the support I received from my PAF. My PAF not only gave me candid social advice, but he also navigated me through course selections and shopping best practices. The academic advice I received from my PAF and his friends with interests that related to my own was more than helpful — it was foundational to my Harvard classroom experience.
Could revamping the freshman adviser program allow for the same caliber of guidance? I assume many students now on campus would say no. The freshman advisers I encountered did not have an inkling about what classes were like and did not approach selections holistically. Of course, this is not true across all advisers, but the freshman advising horror stories are abundant.
Granted, the PAF program has its issues. There are absentee PAFs who perhaps do no more good than an indifferent advisor. However, having the PAF network within freshmen entryways means that students have other resources within reach. Additionally, sometimes PAFs’ academic experiences are not pertinent to their PAFees’ interests. This is seldom a huge issue, however, because PAFs can connect advisees to friends or other PAFs with more applicable advice. Regardless, all PAFs have general social and academic advice worth sharing — advice that is certainly more applicable on a daily basis than that of freshman advisers.
Even if students give the College the benefit of the doubt and assume that their retraining effort will bring advisers up to speed on class selections, it would not justify the restructuring of the PAF program. There is truly no replacement for student advice. A faculty adviser may know every Q score, know each professor, and have the course catalog memorized, but they cannot understand the student experience. They cannot connect students with peers that have recently taken the same class, and they cannot give the candid advice that students need in certain classes. PAFs, however, are an equalizer. Without them, students with stronger networks at Harvard will have the upper hand before classes even start.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Divest Harvard is a useful microcosm of the modern environmental movement that I think has a lot to work on. At two crucial turns the movement lets me down.
First, it abandons the simple decision-making framework of cost and benefit in favor of panicked alarmism, leading to its own misguided mission. Listen to any divest protest or mainstream environmentalist messaging, and it is impossible to avoid the common idea that climate change is the “single most important issue” of today, and a future catastrophe waiting to destroy us.
From this starting point, divestment mimics a common theme in modern environmentalism: fixating on a particular course of action not so much because it is a clear effector of positive change but because it symbolically looks like environmentalism. The ideas born of this strategy represent such a small subset of the potential steps we can take towards addressing climate change that it is no surprise that they are rarely compelling — take plastic recycling, and bans on plastic bags as examples. If they are symbolically forceful it is the wrong symbol, one that says we are committed to optics before reason.
Second, the Divest movement also embodies the uncooperative and unproductive political strategy that comes from this kind of bogeyman-environmentalism. Blockading University offices, interrupting speaking events, and demanding rather than questioning, the Divest movement almost prides itself in its combativeness. It persists in making divestment out to be a moral choice with just one right answer, and will not budge from its firm stance within this binary framework. In the larger environmental movement, this same with us or against us mentality has pushed our political options to either near denialism or full prioritization, neither of which seems to be the optimal path forward.
In order to avoid repeating these mistakes of its past, the environmentalism movement needs to fundamentally recast the climate change crisis in the following terms. First, it is a crisis no less earthly than that of health care or criminal justice. In fact, the most recent comprehensive study assessing the increased costs of climate change, approximates an annual $224 billion additional cost to the U.S. economy by 2090 if we continue on our current emissions trajectory. This $224 billion figure is a far cry from warnings of an “existential crisis.” As a spot check, it barely reaches half of the estimated cost of the opioid crisis.
The climate change crisis is also not out of the ordinary in a second sense: Like most difficult problems, there are a range of strategies to move forward with, all of which have pros and cons. A carbon tax would reduce carbon emissions, but at the same time it stunts economic productivity. Adopting the Paris climate accord would limit global warming to a few degrees Celsius, but also be incredibly costly — excessively so, according to one paper by a Nobel Prize winner. The solutions we adopt should maximize value, striking a balance between the economic and social costs of enacting policies, and those of living with some of the effects of climate change.
An environmentalist movement grounded in this outlook would see vast improvements in its two current weaknesses.
It would first learn to look beyond the basic symbolism of possible approaches and embrace that there are many different arguments for different tradeoffs. It wouldn’t take much of this thinking to see why divestment doesn’t make sense. On the one hand, Harvard can bear the financial handicap that divestment places on the people managing the endowment. On the other hand, Harvard can also participate in the global climate change fight by leveraging its position as a leading research institution to explore vital new energy science, or by educating future visionaries about these problems. If we compare these two options, I would bet that Harvard can accomplish a lot more by acting like the university that it is than the fiscal policy maker that it is not.
Second, the movement would cast aside the black and white moralism that drowns its political rhetoric — after all, since when has any fiscal policy decision been a clear cut moral issue — and adopt a more sensible political strategy.
This is especially important when all the best solutions within this framework require national and even global political action. Grassroots approaches like consumer energy-saving and recycling or institutional divestment will struggle to have an impact because of the inevitable lack of full participation. There’s nothing wrong with accepting that people won’t all become vegetarian, and the world’s investors won’t all divest from fossil fuels.
Adapting its political strategy to these realities, the movement would then do good to ally with the 38 percent of Americans who see climate change as “a major problem but not a crisis,” or the 15 percent who see it as “a minor problem.” It should appeal to them with more accessible and unemotional rationales that respect their view of climate change as just one of the many issues worth addressing. Show them why some investments in clean energy will have greater return than investment in higher education, or prison reform, or healthcare.
Passion is fine, and so is speaking up loudly. The efforts up to this point have brought, at the very least, due attention to a very real problem. To move forward now, the environmentalism movement needs to temper the alarmism it has fostered, seek rational solutions, and carry them tactfully to the political sphere.

The Cambridge City Council has voted overwhelmingly for the “Cannabis Business Permitting Ordinance,” which opens the door for recreational cannabis businesses in Cambridge. Notably, the legislation includes an amendment from Councilors Sumbul Siddiqui and Quinton Zondervan, establishing a two-year ban on cannabis businesses with owners who do not come from historically marginalized groups.
We believe this amendment is indicative of a concerted effort on the part of Council members to grapple with socioeconomic inequality in this city. Further, we are glad that the City of Cambridge is progressing on actually implementing marijuana legalization by facilitating the opening of local shops, and we appreciate the reparative spirit of the Council’s legislation as it seeks to right the injustices of the War on Drugs and associated historical discrimination. The attempt to make space for the victims of the War on Drugs and affected communities of color to have a first shot at opening marijuana-related businesses in Cambridge is admirable.
However, to be blunt, we feel that the groups that this legislation supports are too broad, and that more specific consideration to groups marginalized specifically by the War on Drugs would be more appropriate. Generalizing legislative support beyond the specifically affected populations seems to undermine the significant work the bill seeks to achieve. In particular, while we believe the Council has an active role to play in promoting women’s economic empowerment through a variety of city programs, we do not believe that groups not affected directly or indirectly by the War on Drugs should be included in this program.
This amendment unfortunately generalizes the plight of a group of people dealing with the historically specific dynamics of the War on Drugs into a shared struggle of all historically marginalized groups. Marginalized groups can be disadvantaged each in their own way, and this amendment offers a one-size-fits-all approach that does not give adequate concern to the directly reparative spirit in which we understand the intentions of this ordinance. It homogenizes the experience of minority groups and directs regulatory privilege towards a broader group of people in a way that belies the degree to which the burden of the War on Drugs fell disproportionately on African American and Latinx communities. While white women have faced a historical struggle that merits policy redress on a variety of dimensions, the impact of the War on Drugs on them specifically does not seem to us to be among them, particularly relative to more directly and heavily affected groups.
Even though the amendment casts too wide of a net in its support, we still applaud the ingenuity of the Cambridge City Council. Complex problems require creative solutions, and the spirit of experimental policymaking is at the heart of that important work. We hope that the Council continues taking up the task of repairing the negative effects of the War on Drugs — and all systemic oppression of marginalized groups — through innovative social policy. For example, to further Cambridge’s commitment to repairing that harm, we hope that the Council will advocate for expungement of criminal records for low-level drug offenses.
If this legislation is successful, we hope that other state and local governments will follow suit with policies of this kind and adopt more broadly this kind of creative policymaking attitude. Despite our criticism, we remain hopeful that this legislation can be a productive first step in addressing the damage done to victims of the War on Drugs and their communities.

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences ended fiscal year 2019 with a reported $13.6 million surplus, according to the Dean’s annual report.
That figure represents a substantial increase from the $3.1 million surplus in fiscal year 2018. Prior to 2018, the school reported at least four straight years of budget deficits.
This year’s larger surplus represents less than 0.1 percent of FAS’s annual budget, which is close to $1.6 billion. Among the school’s largest expenses were the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative, on which FAS spent $200.9 million and House Renewal, which cost $91.2 million. Compensation for faculty increased by nearly 5 percent this year compared to a 3.4 percent increase during fiscal year 2018.
Nonetheless, the report states that FAS still faces a “time of financial challenges and uncertainty.” Without an internal debt restructuring agreement that FAS reached with the University in 2017, it would still be running a deficit, according to the report.
“The short-term relief afforded by the debt restructuring will give way to higher costs in time as the FAS compensates the University for reduced payments in the early years,” the report states.
The report also provides updated information on faculty searches and hiring. The overall size of the faculty has shrunk slightly in the past year, from 734 to 724. The report attributed the decrease to both “a lower-than-expected number of successfully completed searches” and “a higher-than-expected number of faculty departures.”
During the 2018-2019 academic year, FAS conducted 49 ladder faculty searches and made job offers to 34 candidates, 23 of whom accepted. Acceptance rates varied by gender, with 56 percent of women and 80 percent of men taking their offers. Three offers are still pending, two of which went out to women.
The report notes that of the women who have declined FAS’s job offers to date, “the majority cited spousal considerations in their decision.” In a May interview, Gay defended the University’s policy for spousal hires. Currently, FAS assists spouses of new hires with hunting for jobs in the area but does not give them preference for internal jobs in the way some universities do.
FAS put 16 of its ladder faculty up for tenure this year, with 11 cases succeeding. Female candidates saw an 80 percent success rate in their reviews, while male candidates prevailed 64 percent of the time.
The report notes that representation of both women and minority ladder faculty grew for the seventh year in a row.
FAS Dean Claudine Gay will present the report at the Faculty’s monthly meeting Tuesday, the first of the semester.
At the meeting, professors Edward J. Hall, James G. Anderson, and Naomi Oreskes will introduce a discussion on climate change and “Harvard’s appropriate response” to the “ecological crisis,” according to the agenda. At an April faculty meeting, University President Lawrence S. Bacow agreed to host an open forum or dedicate a portion of a future meeting to discuss fossil fuel divestment, in response to a request from Hall.
Professor Robert A. Lue will also update the Faculty on “expanded services” at the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning, which provides instruction to faculty members and teaching fellows.

The Undergraduate Council allocated $4,000 to fund the inaugural year of its First-Generation Faculty Mentorship Program on Sunday at its first meeting following fall elections.
UC President Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 and Vice President Julia M. Huesa ’20 planned the details of the First-Generation Faculty Mentorship Program over the summer, and the UC formally voted to launch the program earlier this month. The mentorship program pairs freshmen students identifying as first-generation with faculty members to advise them. Forty faculty members and 65 students will participate in the program during its pilot year.
Palaniappan said she and Huesa decided to establish the program after many first-generation students on campus said they had difficulty in navigating the culture of higher education.
The legislation notes that challenges such as “knowing how to talk to professors” and “being able to ask for extensions/academic support” are among the difficulties first-generation students may face.
While the formal mentorship pairing lasts for one academic year, Palaniappan said she hopes the relationships can continue informally throughout the students’ time at the College and beyond.
The newly allocated funding will be used solely to “help facilitate interaction through more intimate conversations — over coffee or lunch — between student mentees and faculty mentors in order to build more meaningful relationships,” according to the legislation.
Each student-faculty pair will be granted $30 per semester to spend on their meetings.
“We want to make sure that students have the opportunity not to think of these as a financial burden for them to participate with their faculty mentor,” Palaniappan said during the meeting.
Palaniappan and Huesa said they hope that after a successful inaugural year of the program, other Harvard offices will be able to fund the program and ensure its continued support.
Sunday marked the UC's first meeting for dozens of newly-elected members. More than half of this year’s council are first-time representatives.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Oct. 2, 2019 at 7:16 a.m.
The Harvard University Police Department suspended an officer Wednesday for one week without pay after an investigation found he physically assaulted another officer who called him a homophobic slur, according to representatives from the Harvard University Police Association union.
During a dispute in the HUPD parking lot roughly four years ago, officers Josiah Christian and Thomas F. Karns engaged in a physical altercation after Karns allegedly called Christian, a black officer, a “f----t n----r,” according to union officials who represent Christian. HUPD Deputy Chief Michael Giacoppo launched an internal investigation into the incident this past summer after another officer brought it to the attention of management.
During the investigation, Karns — a detective — disputed that he called Christian the n-word; the investigation concluded that there was not enough evidence to prove that Karns had used the n-word, according to HUPA President Michael J. Allen and HUPA Vice President Joseph E. Steverman. The investigation, however, found that Karns had used the word “f----t,” according to Allen and Steverman. As representatives of Christian’s union, HUPA leaders were notified of the inquiry and of the investigation’s findings.
Karns did not respond to multiple requests for comment, and HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano declined to comment on the case.
“It is both the policy of the HUPD and the University not to comment on personnel matters,” Catalano said.
Allen and Steverman allege that HUPD officials — including HUPD Chief Francis “Bud” D. Riley — who were present in a meeting about the investigation  said at the time that they believe Christian was called both the homophobic slur and the racist slur. Evidence found in the investigation, however, could not ultimately prove that Karns said the racist slur.
Catalano denied that HUPD leaders ever told Christian that they believed Karns used both slurs.
"The allegation that HUPD officials believe that the offensive words were used and shared that belief with the union leadership is false,” Catalano said. “We are unable to provide more specifics because we do not comment on personnel matters as a matter of policy."
At the conclusion of the investigation, HUPD Chief Francis “Bud” D. Riley suspended Christian for seven days without pay.
Allen and Steverman said that HUPD told them Karns would face punishment, but would not be terminated. But, HUPD did not tell them what punishment Karns would face because Karns is not a current member of the union, which only represents patrol officers.
Christian did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
The executive board of HUPA — which includes Allen, Steverman, Treasurer William Connell, and Secretary Michael Davenport — condemned Christian’s suspension in a written statement to The Crimson Friday. They wrote that they are “saddened and discouraged” by the decision not to terminate Karns’s employment.
The board members also called the punishment “egregious.”
“The lack of respect/concern shown to Officer Christian and all minority, gay and lesbian, and members of the Harvard University Police Department is disheartening to say the least,” the board wrote.
HUPD generally initiates an internal investigation once a potential violation of department policies comes to the attention of management, according to Catalano. An investigator — who in more significant investigations is a deputy chief or lieutenant — conducts a formal inquiry and writes a report of their findings. In that report, the investigator decides whether to sustain any allegations.
Giacoppo started reaching out to officers about the incident between Christian and Karns on or before July 18, according to internal emails obtained by The Crimson. Christian submitted his own memo — a copy of which The Crimson obtained — to Giacoppo alleging that the incident took place in a HUPD garage “approximately 4/5 years ago.”
Christian wrote that Karns approached his vehicle and told him that he had obstructed Karns’s path to pull out of the garage. Christian alleged in his memo that he moved his vehicle to allow for Karns to exit and unsuccessfully urged Karns to move away.
Karns then refused to leave, and Christian got out of his vehicle to confront Karns, according to the memo. Christian wrote that the two were “yelling” and “nose to nose with each other” until Christian started walking away. After further arguing, Christian moved toward Karns and alleged that Karns then said, “Fuck you, f----t n----r.”
Christian wrote that the interaction then became physical.
“Immediately after hearing this derogatory statement from Tom [Karns], the verbal altercation quickly became physical,” Christian wrote. “Both Tom and I were holding onto each other and pushing each other.”
Bystanding officers then intervened and pulled Christian and Karns off of each other, Christian wrote.
The union plans to go through a grievance procedure to retrieve Christian’s seven days of pay, according to Allen and Steverman.
At the conclusion of their statement, the union’s executive board urged Harvard affiliates to make their feelings about the incident known.
“We hope the Harvard community whether or not you are a minority, part of the LGBTQ community, students, faculty, investors, employees and Harvard Alumni share in our deep disappointment in the direction the Harvard University Police Department Administration took with the facts presented to them regarding this incident,” the statement reads.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard women’s soccer opened Ivy League play with a big 1-0 win over reigning Ivy League co-champions Penn in front of an announced crowd of 1,456 that filled the bleachers at Ohiri Field.
A year after two overtimes were not enough to break a 0-0 tie between these two teams in Philadelphia, freshman forward Gabby DelPico made sure there would be no repeat, slotting home a low cross from junior forward Lauren Raimondo in the 72nd minute to break the deadlock.
“I think we’ve just got a little bit more quality this year in the attack,” head coach Chris Hamblin said. “I think we can break teams down in different ways. I don’t think we were able to be as composed in the first half, but eventually we’re going to wear them down. We did, and Gabby showed up for a fantastic finish late in the game. I think it was deserved. I think we earned that.”
It was the final game of a perfect three game homestand for the Crimson (7-2, 1-0 Ivy) and Harvard’s fourth straight win overall. It was a strong overall performance for the Crimson, which dominated the Quakers (5-3-1, 0-1) in the first half, controlling possession, piling on the pressure, and outshooting Penn 8-1 while creating the only four shots on goal of the half.
“I was really proud of how we started the game and took the game to them,” Hamblin said. “The wind played a factor, so we had more of the territory in the first half, and unfortunately we couldn’t find the answer, we wouldn’t find the goal.”
Despite the strong overall first half performance and in particular the driving runs and dangerous crosses that typify a performance from junior playmaker Murphy Agnew, who was terrific again on Saturday, Harvard struggled to create particularly great chances.
But if a team dominates the game for long enough, as the Crimson continued to do early in the second half, the goal usually comes. While Penn’s defense was sound, Harvard’s near-constant presence in the opposing third finally paid off when Raimondo picked out DelPico in front of goal and gave the Crimson the goal it never found in Philadelphia last year.
It was DelPico’s fourth goal of the season, tying her for the team lead with fellow freshman standout Angela Caloia - who was also credited with an assist on DelPico’s goal - and sophomore Sophie Hirst.
“It was a combination of good play all around throughout the team,” DelPico said. “Lauren [Raimondo] did exactly what we practiced in warmups, which is dribbling inline and then dropping it back in, and then I finished.”
After being held in check for most of the game, Penn’s attack woke up after the Harvard goal, unleashing six shots, including its first three on goal of the match, in the game’s final 15 minutes to quadruple its overall shot total. The Crimson defense, which had been so assured for most of the game, struggled to clear the ball late, inviting more pressure from the trailing Quakers.
Penn’s late pressure created a fantastic, tense atmosphere, and on more than one occasion the Quakers seemed set to knot the game at one and send it to overtime. But Harvard’s senior goalie, Kat Hess, stood tall in goal, displaying calm and control.
It was only fitting that Hess, the star of the game’s last 15 minutes, made her final save as the whistle blew. She fired the ball into the air and rushed off to celebrate the perfect start to the league season with her teammates.
The Ivy League rivals continued a recent tradition of low-scoring battles, as there have been just three total goals scored in their fixtures over the last four years, with the 0-0 draw last season surrounded by 1-0 finishes.
DelPico, for one, is eager to build on her first-ever Ivy League game and goal.
“I think there’s definitely a lot more nerves in the air [in Ivy League games],” DelPico said. “You can feel everybody being tense and having high expectations, but I think what it came down to is us just playing our game we know how to play, treating it not like it’s this huge thing but playing the same way we’ve been playing throughout the other games.”
The Crimson will embark on a three game road trip starting next weekend when it faces Yale, which notched a big 1-0 win of its own this weekend against Princeton. While the Crimson and Bulldogs finished fourth and seventh respectively in the Ivy League last season, it appears that the rivals may be headed for greater things this year.

The first month of the term is over, meaning that you’re probably either skipping your classes or taking some fat naps during those “mandatory attendance” ones. But what if you actually want to learn something and make some good use of your time in class? Here are some Flyby hacks for staying awake in class.
Skip the Lunch Carbs
The number of times we’ve crashed during afternoon lectures right after eating a huge lunch definitely requires more than a few hands to count. If possible, try to eat after class, or just take a snack with you to lecture.
Sit in the Front
When was the last time you slept right in front of your professor? That’s right: probably never. Sitting in the front row is just like another form of caffeine, and you’ll at least be fighting to keep those eyes open.
Sit Next to Your Lecture Hall Crush
Here, you can kill two birds with one stone. Spend some quality time learning about the glory of free market economies, while your dopamine levels rise as you sit next to your 1:30 p.m. Science Hall B romantic interest.
Take a Midday Coffee Break
Morning coffee wasn’t good enough? Just take another cup before your afternoon haul. Make sure you take a bathroom break before classes start, though, since leaving in the middle kind of defeats the whole goal of actually being present in lecture.
While “get more sleep!” is probably the healthy answer to most problems in life, we don’t blame you if you struggle to get everything done while still fitting in those eight hours. Next time you’re looking to actually pay attention in class, though, at least you’ll have some creative ways to keep your eyes open.
