Harvard’s Engineering Sciences 20: “How to Create Things and Have Them Matter” is a course that, above all, invokes the power of imagination. Though the course has existed at Harvard for almost a decade, it has gradually evolved from a course primarily focused on foundational biotechnology to an engineering course focused on the creative process.
Atypical of most science classes, Engineering Sciences 20 (ES20) encourages its young engineers to synthesize their science with an artistic vision. “We are often encouraged to focus on the outcome of art [and] science. But the ephemeral intermediate outcome and the evolving dynamic process is inevitably more full of potential...Having limited value as product alone, art and science are liberated when they are focused on as pure process,” says Engineering Professor David A. Edwards, who has taught several iterations of ES20 over the years. This year, he is co-teaching the course with Engineering Professor Robert D. Howe.
At first, it may seem that this course was mislabeled. After all, ES20 requires no background in engineering, and encourages students to think outside the conventional boundaries of the introductory engineering class. “When a student comes to us thinking that they have everything figured out, we’ll generally push them to work on an idea that they think is good—but [are] not yet sure how they’re going to make that happen,” says Beth Altringer, one of the ES20 teaching fellows. As a result, the course has been a springboard for international collaborations and various prototypes that past students now feature around the world.
Part of what makes ES20 so groundbreaking is its connection to The Laboratory at Harvard. The Laboratory—principally an exhibition and meeting space for student idea development within and between the arts and sciences—is currently in its second year of operation. Suelin Chen, Director of The Laboratory, emphasizes that the “Idea Translation” component of the Laboratory allows ES20’s students to pursue innovative work. Each year, the Idea Translation program extends funding to ES20 students’ projects and helps them build prototypes to be featured in an annual exhibition. One project from ES20 that was featured in last year’s exhibition was the “Soccket,” a soccer ball that stores energy when kicked. Students featured in the exhibition can then develop their projects in summer workshops around the world: the Idea Translation program is based here in Cambridge and at Le Laboratoire in Paris, but there are partner sites developing in Africa, Singapore, and Saudi Arabia. The international aspect of this class encourages students to feel as if their ideas can have real global impact.
Each year, ES20 focuses on a central theme: this year, the theme is water. “In a way, water is everything. Water is life, water is clouds, water is all around. It’s a pretty open ended theme, but that’s the point,” says Edwards. Students split into small groups according to a previously agreed upon ‘problem’ relating to the central theme, and from there, develop their ideas independently. Often, these student projects diverge in fascinating directions. Currently, Alexandre J. Terrien ’11’s group is developing a form of organic, reusable packaging that can dissolve into something useful as soon as somebody consumes what is inside. Terrien is a student fellow at the Laboratory and blogs about its projects in conjunction with the Laboratory’s partner “art-science labs” around the world.
ES20 is much more than a Harvard prerequisite science course, with Q scores and concentration credit garnering constant attention. This course brings together art and science to help its students determine what really matters in each of their project designs. “Contrary to popular belief, engineers are very creative people. The word ‘engineer’ is derived from the word ‘ingenuity’ ...  engineers are actually ingenious people,” says Howe. Indeed, this course has demonstrated that sparking the imaginations of its student engineers is as important as building their technical foundations.

“It’s about x times y equals one,” says Aki Sakamoto as she readjusts her squat and smiles up at her audience. “And mother.” She is posed as a performance artist in the middle of her own installation work “Secrets of My Mother’s Child.” Brought to Cambridge by the Office for the Arts at Harvard last Thursday, Sakamoto—a Japanese artist based in New York City recently featured in the Whitney Biennial—fused performance and visual art into a novel medium of storytelling.
Harvard’s newest art space, Arts @ 29 Garden St., is white-walled and sparse. Hanging from the walls are three intersecting orange strings, each weighted by black wooden beads and joined at the center by a short-legged black stool. Beneath the stool are grapefruit peels. Pieces of brown butcher paper are taped to the wall. “There are four categories of people in the world.” She draws a circle in black charcoal. “Ninety-nine percent are the Normal people. You know, ‘I like going to yoga on Sundays’ people. The kind of people who go to the bathroom together.” The audience laughs. She draws another circle. She’s energetic in her black jumpsuit—her toes are always curled upwards, and she moves with an assurance that contrasts phenomenally with the spontaneity of her monologue. Her discussion leaps around—from explaining graphs displayed on the gallery walls to noting why she represents her mother with grapefruit to discussing the orange mesh tangerine bags that she hung from the ceiling of her apartment to talking about the plight of what she calls  “Art.” Her conversation is accentuated by the physicality of her installation work—and by the grapefruit that she passes around for the audience to eat. Charcoal and brown paper litter the space in an oddly purposeful choreography.
The three strings Sakamoto has strung across the room represent, as it turns out, axes of a graph. The stool connecting the axes at the origin, she says, was given to her by a homeless man in New York City. Explaining the axes, she says, “I was trying to experience being a graph.” Sakamoto uses her art “as a way of thinking things out”—things like mathematics, people, her relationship with her mother—and the connections she makes are quite unusual. “I always think about the graph of [a] tangent [function] when people talk about manic depression,” she says to her audience. “I wanted to experience asymptotes somehow.” Her way of experiencing asymptotes—and the way she allows her audience to experience them—is highly tangible. To move around the room, one has to duck beneath, or step over, the cords. The pieces of grapefruit peel on the floor are arranged in threes beneath the axes.
Much of what Sakamoto uses in her artwork are ‘found objects’—an old cabinet she ran across in New York, for instance, or the stool the homeless man gave her. She co-opts these pieces of the world into her artwork, and in doing so amplifies her artistic vision. Hers is an artwork based not so much on what she creates as what she arranges, and the ideas that spark out of her choreographed collisions.
Some of the objects she uses in her art seem commonplace, like an overturned table or a jam jar with a red-checked lid. And some of the ideas she discusses seem, at the outset, clichéd—breaking people into four categories, for instance. However, in the light of Sakamoto’s performance, everything seems reborn. They may be the sort of tangerine bags you can buy at the grocery store, but hung from the ceiling with soap and lanterns inside of them, they do indeed seem more like a bizarre graph, or alien life-forms with streamers attached. It may be that other people have discussed the artistic temperament before, but none have characterized it as buried underground, growing like a potato—she draws a brief sketch of how potatoes grow—or as riding an “A-train” up around the “Normal people” and the “Tinkerbells”—another of her categories—until it careens back to earth.
It is not Sakamoto’s visual work that makes her art, nor is it the discussion-performance she enacts with her awed spectators. There’s rather something in Sakamoto herself, in the fusion of the elements and the momentum of the mind behind them, that makes the experience she shares perpetually surprising and sometimes universally applicable. Her angle on the world is infused with every element of her life—her conversations, her drawings, and her way of seeing her ex-girlfriend as a pumpkin and her mother as a grapefruit. The pleasure of experiencing her art is watching her use it not so much to represent the world, but to  re-present the elements of her life.

“It’s a good experience to see how many talented women there are,” said Berklee College of Music professor Christiane J. Karam last Wednesday. Those who attended the 14th annual Women Musicians Network (WMN) Concert at the Berklee Performance Center—which showcased the broad musical tastes and talents of Berklee women singers, performers, writers, and producers—discovered this striking female talent for themselves. The concert featured 10 of Berklee’s own female students in a show that encompassed an enormous variety of musical genres. From Silvina Moreno’s Argentinian jazz composition “Mañana” to Se-eun Kim’s Japanese film score “Mysterious Wind,” WMN’s female performers offered a stylistic spectrum of musical talents from around the world.
The event directors, Karam and Berklee College of Music professor Lucy Holstedt, sought diversity while shaping the concert. After spending three days sifting through over 100 submissions, the women decided on a varied group of 10 artists that covered as many areas of the world and aspects of music as possible. Karam, who performed in the WMN annual show while a Berklee student herself, said, “my role [as event director] is to share the vision of what we want the show to be, and try to make it as diverse as possible. We want to represent as many of the facets of the Berklee student population as possible.”
This range of performers was not confined to merely the Berklee student population: the concert also featured two special non-student groups in the evening’s eclectic body of performers. The first was the Berklee City Music Prep Ensemble, an ensemble featuring singers from Boston-area middle schools who, despite their age, held their own beside Berklee’s more experienced students. Their arrangement of Michael Jackson’s “Earth Song” received a boisterous standing ovation. By successfully showcasing talented youngsters in their program, Berklee proudly advocated the future of their school’s music while bringing an element of gospel to the show.
The second guest artist was Daniela Schächter, who was awarded the annual faculty honor of performing in the WMN Concert. Schächter, a Berklee assistant professor and a former student participant in the concert, performed an emotional modern jazz composition entitled “Ripresa.” Karam, a former classmate of Schächter’s at Berklee, praised her selection and said, “[Schächter is] one of the hardest working people I know in the business,” she said. “She’s extremely focused, human, and has a gentle loving nature.”
Indeed, the entire body of performers reflected Karam’s praise: the concert exuded a mood of joyful collaboration. Holstedt, who co-founded the program 14 years ago, said “I just love the kind of collaboration we have in this show—there aren’t any big egos [and] everyone is really in it for the music.” Katie H. Marshall, who performed her catchy original pop tune, “Liar Fire Sire Quagmire,” agreed with Holstedt’s sentiments. She said, “[everyone was] cheering each other on. Before we went on stage we were holding hands—there was so much support from each other.”
Although in many ways the annual WMN concert is an effort to help talented female artists gain connections and network with each other, Holstedt believes it exemplifies a larger purpose. WMN is vital because “it highlights women in leadership roles” while offering upcoming artists a valuable performance opportunity. “Some of these students haven’t performed on a huge scale before; they haven’t been leaders of groups,” Holstedt said. Marshall agreed, saying that the rehearsals gave her “the sense of what working in the professional world would be like.”
Berklee offers its students opportunities to break into the professional world—but this is not WMN’s only role. As Karam said, “the role of the concert is not to dismiss anyone, but to emphasize the beauty and the power of what happens when you put a bunch of women together.”

Skinwalking
March 23-26, 7:30 p.m. and March 26, 2:30 p.m.
Loeb Experimental Theater
Directed by Cecelia A. Raker ’11
Produced by Katherine M.  Agard ’13
“It’s about the encounter of an adamantly rational person with the world of the gritty and the miraculous,” says Cecelia A. Raker ’11, writer and director of the new play “Skinwalking.” The play, also Raker’s senior thesis, draws deeply from her experiences growing up in New Mexico. A story of religion, fantasy, and family, “Skinwalking” weaves an intricate tale of mystery and emotion.
On the surface, “Skinwalking” tells the story of Mari (Xanthia A. Tucker ’13), a young woman who returns to her childhood home, where she must confront the reality of her grandmother’s death and cope with the problems in her family’s past. To heighten the drama of the plot, Raker places her characters in an alternate universe where religious extremism is fanatically opposed. In this surreal world, a stark dichotomy exists between the zealous religious fervor of the rural hills and the secularism of the rational city. “Place is really important in the show,” says actor Sara S. Lytle ’13. “You can tell it’s set somewhere that Raker knows really well.”
“Skinwalking” is perhaps most notable for its monstrous and mythical namesake, the Skinwalker (Rebecca H. Kwan ’14). Meant to embody loneliness, fear, and self-doubt, Kwan stalks and slithers across the stage, ‘taking on new skins’ in the manner of a traditional werewolf or shape-shifter. To emphasize these transitory states, much of the show is highly choreographed and intensely physical. “When you’re trying to access a lot of very painful feelings, synching your body with your emotional shifts provides a lot of depth,” says Lytle.
Like the play’s title character, the production itself has undergone several transformations over the course of its rehearsals. Raker has encouraged each of her actors to craft an individual interpretation of the play’s characters. “It’s impossible to have a one-woman show or a one-man show,” she says. “I love that point where the actors start to know the characters better than I do.” Producer Katherine M. Agard ’13 expresses a similar sense of anticipation for the show. “It’s going to be surprising, I think,” she says.

R.E.M.’s latest album “Collapse Into Now,” is misnamed. It isn’t in fact a complete ‘collapse’ for the band—but neither is it a step forward. “Collapse Into Now” is R.E.M.’s half-hearted attempt to evolve as a band. The album draws more from a broad swath of influences from classic rock to psychedelic music than from their own past. Through their incorporation of classic yet disparate influences, they only prove that they’re strongest when sticking to their original sound.
“Collapse Into Now” flows as well as any other R.E.M. album; it does not, however, have the coherence and unity that have set their previous work apart. While even their experimental albums “Around the Sun” or “Out of Time” saw R.E.M. committed to a new style, the same cannot be said of their latest. The songs seem to come from everywhere—from the stripped-down, piano-driven “Überlin” to the folksy, psychedelic groove of “Me, Marlon Brando, Marlon Brando and I,” an old-school R.E.M. number that borrows heavily from Simon and Garfunkel’s cadences and harmonies. Unlike the rest of the album, however, these two songs at least do a good job of recalling their respective eras while still retaining R.E.M.’s unique sound.
On songs like “Mine Smell Like Honey,” where R.E.M. goes back to their original alt-rock style, it’s easy to remember why they were so popular in the first place. The song is upbeat but not giddy, with a standard guitar-bass-drums instrumentation and a compelling, if repetitive, chorus. At times the song definitely pushes in a new direction, but it still sounds like their original stuff from the eighties. “Alligator Aviator Autopilot Antimatter” also hearkens back to “Radio Free Europe,” their first ever single, which established their vastly influential sound.
Unfortunately, these songs are the exceptions, not the rule. Too many songs are like “Oh My Heart,” an unfortunate folksy ballad that inexplicably opens with a badly tuned brass section, or “That Someone Is You,” a confusing mix of movie references set to what could have been the basis of a decent alt-rock song. “Blue,” the last song on the album, wants to be original but instead turns into an overlong experiment in synthesized music and spoken word. The return of “Discoverer” at the end of the song is a relief because, although “Discoverer” sounds like a lost song by The Who, it is, at least, comprehensible.
Indeed, most of the lyrics on “Collapse Into Now,” while intelligible, are not understandable. Michael Stipe probably has a message he wants to convey, but his lyrics are often jumbled and do not relate to the music in tone or meaning. The lyrics of “That Someone Is You” is at best a list of random film references, which turn an otherwise enjoyable song into a confusing and incongruous stream of words. The most charitable reading would be that the album was not meant to have a cohesive meaning, but that is unlikely.
Though “Collapse Into Now” is not the band’s best work, it does contain some of the attributes of their past successes. Peter Buck’s striking guitar playing, which some cite as the reason for the band’s original success, continues to give songs like “Every Day Is Yours to Win” some edge. In addition, Mike Mills’s bass—although not at the forefront of the songs—adds to the musical depth of the tracks.
Though they have kept some of their signatures, R.E.M. has also put some work into trying out a variety of sounds. While the Georgia boys still sound best on the genre they created, songs like “Blue” prove that they want to change. Unfortunately, Stipe says it best on “Alligator Aviator Autopilot Antimatter”: “I have got a lot to learn.”

This past Saturday, it became easy to forget that the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra (HRO) is a student orchestra. In a stunning concert to raise funds for their upcoming Cuba tour, HRO delivered an ambitious selection of works that not only showcased three challenging Russian classics, but also allowed them to demonstrate their virtuosic grasp on the dynamics and emotions of even the most challenging classical music.
The night opened with Pyotr Tchaikovsky’s “Romeo and Juliet, Fantasy Overture,” conducted by Nicolas A. Olarte-Hayes ’11, the Assistant Conductor of the HRO. Gentle, mournful melodies from the upper strings paired with ominous and darkly rich strains from the lower strings opened the song which then exploded into an energetic accelerando accentuated by the brilliant wind section and crisp, precise percussion.
A “Fantasy Overture,” Tchaikovsky’s exquisite “Romeo and Juliet” is inspired by the famous Shakespeare play of the same name, and indeed the structure of the piece mirrors the plot of the original Shakespeare. After the first powerful build-up and climax, the orchestra introduced the passionate “love theme,” a timeless orchestral motif. This theme returns throughout the piece, and illustrates the rise and fall of Romeo and Juliet’s courtship from the consummation of their love through marriage to their eventual suicide. Especially impressive were the yearning solos in the warm cello section and the impeccable timing of cymbal crashes and timpani rolls that added to the overall thrill and tension of the piece.
Following the Tchaikovsky, HRO performed a challenging and complex piece—Igor Stravinsky’s the “Firebird Suite”—under the baton of Maestro Federico Cortese. The piece opens with enigmatic scales played by the strings and an abrasive part in the low brass section before the lyrical playing of a lone oboe truly unearths the piece’s beauty. The solos in the suite range widely, including the ethereal sounds of the piccolo and flute; the swift and meticulous xylophone, the fast-paced pizzicato of the bass, the otherworldly melodious quality of the harp, and the full depth of the cello. The strength of the solos paired with the musical accuracy of the entire ensemble made for a successful performance, illustrating HRO’s ability to capture vivid and vibrant dynamics and nuances even in more difficult pieces. The piece ends with a regal flash of fiery sound, showcasing the flawless and energetic playing of the orchestra.
Yet HRO had even more in store for the sold-out audience that night as the true highlight of the concert came after the intermission with a refreshing interpretation of the Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 1 performed by Damon Meng ’13, also a Crimson business editor. There was a fierce interplay between the powerful brass and interruptive chords in the orchestra, which provided a breathtaking background against the relentless chords of the solo piano. Meng exuded a commanding stage presence, doing the piece both musical and theatrical justice as he swayed with the music, his hands sweeping across the keys in a blurry flash. While the first movement took the audience by storm with its dramatic flair, the following movement presented a softer reprieve—the strings played a soft, tender pizzicato as a gentler theme was passed on from the flute to the piano to the woodwinds to a cello quartet. Meng seemed to tease the audience with light, quick piano interjections. Finally, the concerto came to a close with Meng’s vigorous, incredibly fast-paced, and rhythmic piano riding the waves of the orchestra’s full sound. After the orchestra’s flawless execution of the infamously difficult ending of this concerto, the audience responded with a standing ovation followed by a shocking two encore performances: Franz Liszt’s “Liebesträume No. 3” and the “Rondo alla Turca” by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, transposed by Arcadi Volodos.
Overall, the concert was a night celebrating the talent of Harvard’s own student body and the glory of an orchestra that was not only presenting some of its finest repertoire, but also preparing to perform in Cuba this summer. Regardless of location, HRO puts on a show that is not to be missed.

Anthropologists have traditionally considered writing one of the hallmarks of civilization. The development of a body of literature is a crucial aspect of a society’s art history, and this is no less true in the case of Pre-Columbian art than in any other. Both oral and written traditions are art forms that create and record cultural myths; those traditions in turn become ingrained in the collective consciousnesses of the societies to which they belong.
The last time I was in Guadalajara, Mexico, four years ago, my parents and I made our usual stop at one of the Librerías Gandhi in the city. We each gathered a stack of books that interested us and piled them onto a table in the coffee-shop bookstore. I picked up “Cantos y Crónicas del México Antiguo,” edited by Miguel León-Portilla. Today it is one of those books I must always have on my shelf to consult, and to look through from time to time, even if I haven’t ever read it all.
The other day I came across a little red book in the Tozzer library with the title “Literatura indígena de América” stamped in white capital letters across the spine. The same Miguel León-Portilla had written the first chapter. It began with his definition of literature: “That careful expression of thinking and feeling, either of a person in particular, or, by way of tradition, of a people” (my translation). Under his definition fall forms of expression not always thought of as literature in the traditional sense, such as oral literature and images. After checking out the book, I felt compelled to explore my “Cantos y Crónicas” once more.
“Cantos y Crónicas” falls under León-Portilla’s definition of literature. It contains mythical stories and epic poetry that define Mexico before the conquest. Leafing through it this time, I found one story particularly interesting: an excerpt León-Portilla had translated from what he simply calls “Manuscript of 1558.” The excerpt tells how the heroic god Quetzalcóatl braves the underworld and the dual gods who rein there (Mictlantecuhtli, the god, and Mictlancíhuatl, the goddess) in order to retrieve bones with which to fashion mankind. Quetzalcóatl is able to trick the gods, who do not want him to take the bones, with the help of his nahual. “Nahaul” was a word for a person’s double—his soul, his totemic animal. Quetzalcóatl means “Feathered Serpent,” and his nahual was said to be a double of his own form.
When Mictlantecuhtli and Mictlancíhuatl find out that Quetzalcóatl has stolen the bones, they order a hole to be dug for him to fall into as he escapes from the underworld. Quetzalcóatl falls into the trap and dies, only to come back to life and converse with his soul, his totemic animal, saying, “What shall I do, my nahual?” His soul responds: “Seeing as things turned out badly, let things unfold as they may” (my translation). In the end Quetzalcóatl takes the bones to Cihuacóatl, the Serpent-Woman goddess who grinds the bones and mixes them with some precious clay and some of Quetzalcóatl’s blood to make humans.
It is one thing to go to a museum and see painted and carved clay, one thing to admire the visual art of Pre-Columbian peoples, but it is quite another experience to read a myth like this one and quietly imagine a dialogue between a god and his soul. I wonder, as the followers of Quetzalcóatl might have, what conversations my nahual and I might have, what it would be like to speak with jade serpents and feathered jaguars. Reading this story is an interactive experience, and though it may be a Spanish translation from an acid-free page and not red-and-black images on amatl paper, we can hear from afar the voices of the past telling us these stories, giving us a deeper perspective on the people made of bones, clay, and blood.

“When I think about everything that I went through on [Lasers], I hate this album,” said rapper Lupe Fiasco in an interview with Complex.com of his continuing conflict with Atlantic Records. Atlantic Records controlled the content and selection of the tracks on Lupe’s latest, and their interference ultimately produced an album of which the rapper is not entirely proud. “A lot of the songs that are on the album, I’m kinda neutral to,” he has said. Indeed, Lupe’s indifference comes across as apathy on the album. Surprisingly, given Lupe’s past originality, it’s almost as if the record were composed from a formula for alternative hip-hop albums, with Lupe disengaged from the generic material. Lupe rose to fame as an idiosyncratic rapper who brought a new style to the emerging genre of alternative rap. However, his third album “Lasers” brings nothing new to rap, and instead finds Lupe settling for uninspired albeit pleasant pop-influenced tracks with catchy hooks.
Album opener “Letting Go,” a retrospective look at a failed relationship, features a strong chorus from Lupe: “Things are getting out of control / Feels like I’m running out of soul / You were getting heavy to hold / Think I’ll be letting you go.” The angst-ridden melody successfully supports the hopelessness evoked by the lyrics. Unfortunately, the following succession of tracks comprises at best an above-average alternative hip-hop album that just as easily could have been released by any of Lupe’s peers, but will undeniably play well in clubs and on the airwaves. Lupe also tries his hand at the techno genre producing “I Don’t Wanna Care Right Now,” an upbeat, club-ready track featuring punchy synthesizers and a heavily Auto-tuned chorus—current party single staples.
Lupe’s thought-provoking lyricism finally emerges in “All Black Everything,” in which he imagines a world where the black slave trade never occurred, and racial discrimination is non-existent: “Malcolm Little dies as an old man / Martin Luther read the eulogy for him.” Similarly demonstrative of Fiasco’s lyrical skill is “Words I Never Said,” in which he unabashedly blazes through touchy political commentary, disdainfully addressing the ‘War on Terror’: “I really think the War on Terror is a bunch of bullshit / Just a poor excuse for you to use up all your bullets / How much money does it take to really make a full clip.” The track also features Skylar Grey, who lent her vocals to the recent Eminem and Dr. Dre collaboration “I Need a Doctor.”
“State Run Radio” is one of the weaker songs on the album, and it constitutes a blunt statement of Lupe’s views on the apparent monotony of popular music. Here, he replicates popular radio station singles, and deems level of talent inversely proportional to amount of airplay: “So beware what’s on the airwaves / And be more aware of what’s not getting airplay / Independent spirits you can barely hear what they’re saying / Truth ain’t getting on like shampoo on an airplane.” In mocking irritating pop singles, Lupe produces one with nonsensical claims and an overconfident but failed attempt at exhibiting the characteristics of songs that he disdains. However, Lupe makes up for the song by closing the record strongly with the John Legend collaboration “Never Let Go.”
“Lasers” is noticeably lacking in profanity, almost unheard of in a rap album; Fiasco often forgoes vulgar epithets for skillfully composed verses broken up by solid choruses. “Break the Chain” is the standard rags-to-riches rap with an up-tempo twist and a lyrical flow that few others can accomplish, and “Beautiful Lasers” opens with a poignant, memorable refrain and equally emotional lyrics. These songs present the perfect marriage of original lyricism and pop sensibilities that the rest of the album is woefully missing.
Though a few standout tracks bring this album up to par with Lupe’s previous work, overall it is a half-hearted effort. “Lasers” has undeniable radio playability and wide appeal, but lacks some of the heart and originality that Lupe Fiasco fans originally loved, and that critics so admire.

Most nerds—and plenty of closet nerds—have some book, some movie, or some series that they obsessed over as a kid. Lots of kids become Tolkienites, poring over not only the original trilogy but also “The Silmarillion,” “The Adventures of Tom Bombadil,” assorted notes discovered while digging through the Tolkien estate’s garbage cans, and so on. There are Star Wars nerds, there are Trekkies—even anthropomorphic rats somehow continue to fascinate hordes of Redwall fans.
As for me, I was a “Final Fantasy” fiend. I grew up watching my brother play through the classic Japanese video game series; I was immediately drawn in by the breathtaking graphics (well, breathtaking back in the mid-’90s anyway). I found myself humming along with the music, often yelling at my brother to slow down so I could read all the characters’ dialogue. I was too much of a wuss to actually play the games for a long time, mind you—they had lots of numbers and menus and words that terrified seven-year-old me—but I read and reread the strategy guide until the pages were falling out and I was coaching my brother on how to play his own game.
So a few weeks ago, when I picked up “Final Fantasy VII” (FFVII) again, I was expecting to relive one of the best gaming experiences I’d ever had. FFVII, after all, has been consistently hailed by game critics and FinalFantaholics alike as one of the greatest games of all time. It’s inspired everything from rap albums to fan-written novellas to heated debates on online message boards. (Case in point: a Google search led me to a 32,000-word analysis of the game’s plot, symbolism, and narrative ambiguities, written by a fan during her spare time. Thesis writers, eat your hearts out.)
My experience replaying FFVII, however, was not so inspiring.
I found myself cringing at some of the heavy-handed dialogue—the game’s antihero, a cold-hearted mercenary named Cloud, has to repeatedly remind the audience just how much he doesn’t care about anyone, evidently because he’s afraid we might not have believed him the first dozen times. And sure, keeping evil corporations from draining all of the planet’s precious Lifestream felt very heroic to preteen me; but the whole setup struck 20-year-old me as a bit hokey and Captain Planet-y. And the graphics—well, what seemed like revolutionary 3D action in 1997 looks more like a first grader’s Play-Doh claymation project today.
I guess some people would tell me, “duh, that’s what you should expect from a 14-year-old game.” After all, it’s just a game, one of hundreds of games that come out each year.
But for me, FFVII hadn’t felt like ‘just’ a game when I played it as a kid. It was far more involved than any mere game of chess or tennis or Tetris. Even though the Play-Doh graphics and synthesizer-heavy soundtrack seem simplistic by today’s standards, at the time everything felt fresh, and the plot was more expansive than any I’d seen in a game before. It truly pushed the boundaries of the medium. While playing, I felt wholly immersed: embarking on a quest, discovering characters’ backstories, unraveling the plot—experiences that ‘just a game’ could never provide.
As I played on, even at age 20 I felt myself being gradually sucked into that experience once more. Even though the game is hindered by the technical limitations of its time, stilted dialogue, and occasionally repetitive gameplay, underneath it all there’s still a cast of characters I’ll never forget and a world I’ll never tire of exploring.
So, no, your average adrenaline-junky trigger-fingered “Call of Duty” gamer would probably not appreciate FFVII—but what does it matter? There’s still someone who made a rap album devoted to the game, for crying out loud. Outdated or not, FFVII’s legacy survives today. Maybe it is just a game—but “Lord of the Rings” is just a book, and “Star Wars” is just a movie. That doesn’t make any of them less magical to the millions of fans who experienced those fantastic worlds, worlds those fans still think, dream, and even obsess about decades after their original releases. Not all fantasies age well, but some—”Final Fantasy” among them—don’t die.

Though easily confused by name, Kurt Weill (pronounced ‘vile’) and Kurt Vile have little in common. “Smoke Ring for My Halo” is nothing like Weill’s “Threepenny Opera,” featuring classic rock instead of classical influences and intricate psychedelic folk songs rather than overtly political operatic numbers. Yet just like “Threepenny Opera,” “Smoke Ring for My Halo” is also an artistic triumph.
“Smoke Ring for My Halo” fits easily in Vile’s typical realm of quirkiness and tranquility. Yet, unlike on his previous album, Vile adds a classic rock twist to his psychedelic folk style. The album is a mélange of different styles, yet it’s derivative of none, and the instrumental aesthetic  is both innovative and accessible.
The tracks are densely produced, filled with overlapping acoustic guitar, keyboard layers, and distorted electric guitars that provide rougher tones. However, Vile also experiments with different keyboard timbres to provide a balance between relaxing softness and edgy energy. The contrast between harsh and gentle tones contributes to Vile’s unique sound. Songs like “Jesus Fever” and “Puppet To the Man” find a balance between distorted power chords and Vile’s soothing psychedelic drawl.
The seamless combination of disparate styles is achieved through Vile’s musical prowess. His exemplary guitar skills allow him to accomplish challenging patterns that add complexity and maturity to his melodies, as demonstrated in the opening song “Baby’s Arms.” On this track, Vile perfectly balances the layers of acoustic guitar, electric guitar, tambourine, and keys to create a lazy atmosphere. Though the album oscillates between laid-back, folkier songs and upbeat rockers, the instrumentation remains a consistent and strong feature through all the tracks and provides an overarching hypnotic atmosphere.
John Agnello’s precise production is essential in bringing out the nuances of Vile’s potentially overbearing musical ambitions. Agnello does an impressive job of mixing a multitude of components together to create a cohesive sound for the album. The intricacies of each song’s composition go easily unnoticed until Agnello subtly features different sounds at specific points in the tracks. In “Ghost Town,” the vocals and electric guitar take turns demanding focus, while the keyboard melody fills in the gaps between transitions. In the background, acoustic guitar chords, shakers and toms keep the beat ambling along at a mid-tempo pace. Vile builds steadily upon a foundation of acoustic guitar with layers of electronic sounds that accumulate until the song climaxes in a cloud of percussion, synthesizers, electric and acoustic guitar, keyboard, and vocals before returning to the simplicity of the same solo acoustic.
Vile’s voice has a crisp but smooth indie quality that contributes to the chilling folksy feel of the album. Moreover, Vile manipulates his tones to suit whichever feeling he seeks to portray, from the psychedelic and serene tone of “On Tour” to the rougher, rocker-rebelliousness of “Puppet To The Man.” His vocal flexibility proves his maturity and skill as a vocalist.
The arresting strangeness of Vile’s voice is mirrored in the pleasing idiosyncrasies of his lyrics. The lyrics address the hardships of romance and identity with refreshingly original imagery. In the song “In My Time,” he sings about reconciling his true personality with an assumed one, “One [face] that erase my discreet disgraces / Pull one over on the shoulder / Ain’t trying / But it’s two worlds, one on each shoulder.” The contrast between the lightheartedness of the instrumentation and the depth of the lyrical themes provides another element of sophistication.
Though Vile’s quirkiness has the potential to alienate, the intricate instrumentation offered on “Smoke Ring for My Halo” makes his music accessible to a diverse range of listeners. The album represents a milestone in his musical development. Though he draws heavily from classic rock, he turns his influences into something totally unique and compelling—a sound all his own.

Housing Day is nigh, and the last thing most freshmen are thinking about when making their lottery wish list is House libraries. Most have probably never been inside one. The news that each House even has a library may come as a surprise. The library may be a stop on a Thursday evening House tour for new students, and it will probably strike some people as a good workspace. A few will even stop to look at the impressive stacks of books crammed from wall to wall. Those students may find it even more surprising that almost no one ever actually uses those books.
It’s been this way for over a decade, at least. In a 2000 Crimson editorial titled “What are House Libraries For?”, Crimson news and editorial editor Adam I. Arenson ’01 wrote bluntly, “No one goes to the House library for books.” Even then, the libraries were used primarily as study spaces. In those days, they at least had librarians to tend to them; now, after the 2009 budget cuts, most are staffed minimally, if at all. There is no way to check a book out of my House library, and there is no way to keep track of where the books are. One would be worried about book thieves, but even they seem to have lost interest. Most of the books sit unconsulted, undisturbed, and unnoticed—classy furniture for what have become glorified reading rooms.
Eliot Library stands frozen in time. There is a typewritten card catalog, but it’s hardly up to date. Kirkland is the only House library to have even a partial record on HOLLIS. The books are not recent. There are standard classics in most fields, but many of the works are outdated, as evidenced by the number of works on the USSR—good luck to anyone looking for a Zadie Smith novel, much less a book on Islamic fundamentalism.
And yet Harvard undergrads react sharply whenever anyone restricts access to these largely unused books. When the Quad Library was dismantled in 2009, there was much grumbling about “taking our books away.” When Dunster, in order to catalogue its collection, literally barred access to its books from October 2009 to September 2010, at least a few upset students argued that it violated the spirit of a university. The books in the libraries have tremendous symbolic value, even if their functional worth is, at the moment, limited.
So what is the future for the holdings of the House libraries? The Spring 2009 report on House renewal recognizes the centrality of the libraries as workspaces, recommending that they be outfitted with more computers and better lighting—and, in the case of the Georgian houses, that they keep the “old Harvard” look. The report found that 59% of students work in House libraries. But only 5% said they use those same libraries’ books, and with good reason. There is no central database, and no clear floor plan. Many of the books have been placed out of order over the years. The library stacks are not quite unusable, but they are technologically obsolete in the eyes of students whose research experience has trained them to be good with keyword searches and online databases rather than card catalogs and shelf-hopping. The House renewal report made no recommendations regarding what should be done with the stacks themselves.
But when renewal begins, this issue will need to be addressed. Can the libraries be integrated into HOLLIS? Should access continue to be restricted to House members? Should the holdings be kept current across all fields, or should they consist of old classics? What will happen to all the once-fashionable books that few people read anymore—the George Meredith novels and H.L. Mencken essays? Renovators will need to do something with the thousands of volumes. What will be their future?
One of the goals of the Harvard University Library under both director Robert C. Darnton ’60 and new executive director Helen Shenton has been the development of a coordinated management structure across the University’s 79 libraries. At the moment, that count does not seem to include the House libraries, which are listed under neither the College Library system nor their own headings. One of the things that could be hoped for is better integration into the College and University Library systems, which could, by giving the Houses the resources needed to document and track their holdings, help improve the accessibility and use of House library resources. The books are there to be used, and hopefully by more than just 5% of any given House. On future Housing Days, preferably students will be able to look forward not just to House formals and Stein Clubs, but also to being able to use their nearby House libraries instead of trekking up to Lamont.

The online description of the Berenice Abbott photography exhibit, currently on display at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) List Visual Arts Center, is misleading. The description states that the exhibit features 18 black and white portraits by the American photographer, whose work celebrates Parisian life in the 1920s. However, one of Abbott’s most famous prints, an image of French writer Jean Cocteau’s hands, does not feature a face, and is not a portrait in the traditional sense of the word. In this image, and others like it, Abbott instead engages in a broader form of portraiture, capturing the various idiosyncrasies of her subjects while preserving her own distinctive artistic style.
Of the 18 prints on display, one of the most striking is “René Crevel,” a portrait of the surrealist writer and famous Parisian bohemian.  A rebel in many senses, Crevel was known both for his communist political beliefs and his bisexuality. In the photo, he is seated and turned in partial profile, wearing an expression of utter confidence and relaxation. Handsome and smartly dressed in a jacket, bowtie, and checkered pants, a closer look at the photo reveals that Crevel is actually somewhat disheveled. His hair has a cowlick in the back that sticks up like a tail feather, his collar is untucked, his jacket is off-center, and his handkerchief is askew. Though sophisticated in his attire, Crevel remains completely absorbed in his thoughts; in these moments, his physical appearance suggests an indifference toward the accepted social standards of self-presentation. In this way, Abbott portrays her subject candidly, capturing both the pensive and the rough-hewn elements of his personality.
Masks and hats appear frequently in Abbott’s photos, as does dark, shadowy lighting. One image depicts a sleeping Jean Cocteau lying in bed next to a white plaster mask, starkly juxtaposing the quiet, almost troubled expression of the resting man with the bright inanimate smile of the mask. Obscuring or hiding one’s face is another commonality in many of the shots. In one memorable image, Jean Cocteau’s right eye is completely hidden behind a gun he is holding. In another less dramatic shot, an aging woman’s lips seem distorted inadvertently, haphazardly covered by a wisp of smoke escaping from her cigarette.
Abbott’s unique artistic style is evident in every picture, whether articulated through her choice of lighting and coloring, or the position of her subjects. The photographs are all silver gelatin prints, but the black and white images manage to  convey a rich array of tones. With lighting, Abbott consistently makes her subjects stand apart from their surroundings in creative and eye-catching ways. In images like “John V. Lacey, Birdsmith,” for instance, Lacey remains visually striking even against the backdrop of a densely cluttered room.
Considered as a whole, the collection presents an intriguing assemblage of images, the subjects of which vary in emotion and appearance, but remain unified in their attitude toward the camera. With Abbott’s help, the sitters each attempt to make a statement about themselves, and offer a glimpse into their true personalities. A beautiful, touching shot of Cocteau’s hands gently folded over his hat and an image of jazz musician Buddy Gilmore exuberantly tapping on a wall like a drum set look nothing alike, yet both photographs capture a particularly essential characteristic of their subject.
The photographs, recently donated by MIT alumnus Ronald Kurtz, will not disappear to a museum after the exhibit is over. Part of the MIT List Visual Arts Center’s Student Loan Art Collection, the prints will be available to any student who wishes to decorate his or her dorm room for the year. So if you find yourself at an MIT party with a black and white portrait on the wall, it may well be worth a second look.

Starting next academic year, the Committee on Degrees in Folklore and Mythology will give seniors the option to forgo the written thesis in favor of a more creative final project. Seniors will be given the option of exploring their interests and “representing their time within the concentration” through a written or non-written medium.
While offering alternatives to an analytic written thesis is not a new phenomenon, it has been largely underutilized within the College. With a handful of exceptions, namely the capstone track offered by the Committee on Degrees in Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality and the creative theses allowed by the English and Visual and Environmental Studies departments, few concentrations provide any sort of culminating project for seniors who want an alternative to the written thesis. Even though the College should continue to keep the senior thesis optional, the Folklore & Mythology Committee’s decision should serve as motivation for other concentrations to re-evaluate their own requirements to give students more options for theses.
Not every Harvard student fits the mold of a future academic. Broader thesis options give students the freedom to explore a wider variety of interests and to build a more specific set of skills better tailored to individual goals. For some students, spending a summer researching a written thesis might take time away from an internship or extracurricular commitment far more relevant to post-college plans. And although the College should never institutionalize pre-professionalism, broadening the traditional definition of what counts as thesis work would nevertheless allow more students to have the opportunity of a substantive, valuable academic undertaking.
Although peer institutions such as Princeton and Reed might derive a benefit from requiring all students to write a thesis, Harvard should continue to allow the senior thesis to remain a self-selective project. Writing a 100-page paper obviously consumes significant resources in terms of both funding and advising, and, if the thesis were a College-wide requirement, not all students would enjoy the same access to the same resources.
Even still, the College should afford more students the opportunity to create some sort of thesis or thesis-like alternative of their own design. While there is an obvious distinction between producing a research-intensive, written analysis and creating a mere final project, a creative or experience-based thesis could, for many, serve as an even more beneficial experience. After all, in a liberal arts curriculum, the thesis represents a unique opportunity for students to explore a single intellectual focus and make an original contribution in a specific field. Additionally, thesis work can also foster a sense of community between the students, faculty members, and administrators—the kind that the people involved remember for years to come. As of now, however—because of a much-too-narrow definition of what constitutes an acceptable thesis—not as many Harvard students take advantage of this opportunity, and alternative theses deserve greater consideration from the College.
Before launching new alternatives to senior theses, however, departments and committees should take steps to identify the reasons why some seniors elect not to write theses in the first place. Any new proposal for an alternative thesis could then be more in line with the unique requirements of the students within a particular concentration. Each concentration should take great care to ensure that the academic quality of the alternative thesis remains on par with that of a written thesis.
In short, when determining what counts as an acceptable academic end to a Harvard undergraduate career, the College would do well interpret the thesis not merely as an extended research paper but rather as a culminating experience that can assume a multiplicity of forms.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
According to CNN’s publication of the 2010 Midterm Election exit polls, 31 percent of gay, lesbian, and bisexual voters chose Republican candidates. GOProud, a political advocacy group that represents gay conservatives, recognizes the wrong-headedness of the assumption that non-heterosexual Americans vote liberal. GOProud’s recent co-sponsorship of the annual Conservative Political Action Conference last month introduced some diehard conservatives to a reality check—gay conservatives deserve a seat at the political table.
GOProud carves out a unique structural hole in both the conservative and gay political worlds. Christopher R. Barron and Jimmy LaSalvia, who both have held Log Cabin Republican directorships, founded GOProud in 2009 after arguing that Log Cabin Republican interests were too narrow and played handmaiden to liberal activists. GOProud ensures that gay conservatives have a seat at the table beyond representing LGBTQ rights, though some have criticized the organization for being too conservative. Indeed, unlike the Log Cabin Republicans, GOProud believes that state-level voters should decide marriage policy and argued that the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which aims to protect non-heterosexual Americans, usurps state rights.
But rather than welcome a new addition to the conservative family, a small handful of conservative organizations pulled out of CPAC partly due to the inclusion of GOProud.
Traditional organizations justifiably maintain that the public purpose of marriage is to connect every child to a father and a mother and that marriage is inherently conjugal. But given their recent history, it is ironic that the very same traditional marriage advocates who have recently been marginalized in the public sphere sought to do the same to gay conservatives on conservative home turf. 
It should first be mentioned that there is more behind these groups’ “boycott” of CPAC than the term would initially suggest. Contrary to popular reports, the Family Research Council effectively pulled out of CPAC a few years ago. The Heritage Foundation has been increasingly concerned about CPAC’s libertarian influences on social and defense issues. To complicate a delicate state of affairs, GOProud co-founder Christopher R. Barron called CPAC sponsor and American Conservative Union Foundation Chairman Cleta Mitchell “a nasty bigot,” among other unflattering comments.
But it is precisely the language of bigotry that should compel traditionalists to welcome GOProud (and Log Cabin Republicans, for that matter). In a heartfelt moment, the two camps might even feel a fair bit of camaraderie–both face remarkable pressure in the public sphere. Boycotting CPAC due to the presence of gay conservatives is akin to what traditionalists accuse liberal progressives of doing—censoring public discourse under the guise of virtue.
Traditionalists observe that some gay marriage advocates have attempted to marginalize opponents instead of participating in a public debate based on good will and intellectual integrity. The Southern Poverty Law Center’s unreasonable declaration that the Family Research Council is a hate group is one example of marginalization. Simplistically labeling traditionalists as mere hateful religionists asserts that they have no claim to reason. Constant recourse to the words “homophobic” and “hateful” is a symbolic attempt to silence those who oppose gay marriage. Homophobia certainly exists. But calling anyone who does not support gay marriage homophobic or hateful is an intimidation tactic; it is not a strategy for rational understanding.
As scholars, we are compelled to resist the proclivity to categorize all that we disagree with under a powerful, misleading, and discussion-halting word. Intimidation rarely works when used against an impassioned, good-willed people, and rightly so. But people use it nonetheless. At CPAC, the traditionalist boycotts essentially attempted to edge GOProud out of the conversation. Similarly, intimidation is a tactic wielded against traditional marriage supporters not so infrequently on Harvard’s own campus.
Democracy does not demand that we silence our opinions or our labels; vehement debate is the hallmark of democracy. But the language of bigotry and accusations that the other side is “hateful” is not vehement debate. It is not debate at all; it is opprobrium. Instead of adopting intimidation tactics, traditionalists should put down their pamphlets and set up GOProud’s booth (and then lend a hand to those at the National Organization for Marriage). Traditionalists have come under much duress in the public sphere and would do well to fiercely defend candid public discourse.
Whether we are traditionalists or progressives, we have the sincerest duty to seek out diversity of opinion and respect other’s beliefs. We should not taint our own beliefs under the gavel of intimidation. The contest of values is real and significant, and the stakes are high. But the contest of values can only be won where both sides are fairly represented, be it in Harvard Yard or at conservative gatherings. True scholars do not attempt to silence the opposition but rather to listen actively with graciousness—and mindful wariness. In the words of G.K. Chesterton, "It is not bigotry to be certain we are right; but it is bigotry to be unable to imagine how we might possibly have gone wrong."

In January, almost a million people turned out on the streets of Alexandria in what the world now calls the Egyptian Revolution. This week, almost 100,000 Wisconsin residents continue to rally in Madison supporting the right of public sector workers’ to unionize. And last Thursday, almost 400 students protested outside of the Institute of Politics as Republican House Majority Leader Eric I. Cantor spoke inside.
The Harvard protestors were united in their condemnation of the Republicans’ proposed budget, which would cut funding for programs like Title X family planning, AmeriCorps, and Obama’s new health care system. But protestors represented groups targeting different budget cuts. While the Harvard Students for Choice held signs defending Planned Parenthood, the Global Health and AIDS Coalition chanted, “health care is a human right!” and members of the Queer Students and Allies, Radcliffe Union of Students, and Student Labor Action Movement  held signs condemning other cuts.
Mostly notably, almost 350 students marched from JFK Park to the IOP in support of AmeriCorps. Their chant—“1, 2, 3, 4, we support AmeriCorps!”—often drowned out other groups’ cries of “human rights are under attack! What will we do? Stand up, fight back!”
In the same week, Harvard students also rallied in support of the Harvard dining hall workers, walked in support of Planned Parenthood, and marched in solidarity with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers’ fight for fair pay. These protests took place apparently in response to a Feb. 23 Crimson staff editorial, which called for American youth to become more politically engaged and take an example from the revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt.
To be sure, there is a fundamental difference between overthrowing a dictatorial regime and protesting budget cuts. Nonetheless, the energy, passion, and commitment that Harvard students demonstrated last week not only hit newspapers as widespread as the Washington Post and ABC News blog but also inspired students, faculty, and community members—including me.
However, although the huge turnout for Thursday’s rallies was thrilling, I could not help questioning the overwhelming focus on AmeriCorps. Of course, AmeriCorps is important; it funds Teach for America and VISTA, which allow grantees or volunteers to teach in public schools or fight poverty at the local level. But many of these grants go to Harvard graduates—in the class of 2010, 18 percent of the class applied for Teach for America positions, and thirty-eight graduates accepted offers from Teach for America.
With this in mind, the disproportionate focus on cuts for AmeriCorps demonstrates a self-serving bias among Harvard students. AmeriCorps serves an important role, but the Republican budget proposes dozens of equally devastating cuts, slashing everything from international food and health grants to job training programs to community health centers to Planned Parenthood.
Samuel B. Novey ’11, one of the organizers of the AmeriCorps rally, told the Crimson that “the budget cuts are an attack on our classmates and the work that they do.” Sadly, although the lack of a Teach for America job might hurt the resumes of a few Harvard graduates, the proposed budget cuts go much farther than simply denying Ivy League graduates their “ability to serve.” While we can find other public service jobs at nonprofits, many Americans depend on community health centers and job training programs for simple survival.
Some argue that exerting a concerted effort on one specific issue holds stronger potential for actually influencing policy. But Harvard’s name and reputation gives students the ability to gain attention for broader goals. I admire student energy for and dedication to supporting this important government program but believe that other causes deserve our equal backing. It is disappointing that even given the opportunity, we as Harvard students have failed to create something bigger than ourselves.
We could have used our voices to call for an end to all destructive budget cuts. We could have asked for entitlement reform, for tax reform, or for cuts in defense spending. Instead, the majority of us focused on an issue directly related to our own lives. In the future, Harvard students should take care to employ their activist energies towards the greatest good.
In the end, the fact that 400 Harvard students turned out for a rally at all remains a remarkable and inspiring testament to our political engagement and capability for activism. But ultimately, advocating for AmeriCorps does not raise Americans out of poverty—and it remains very far from a revolution.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We like to think that when children reach the American public school system, they are on equal footing. However, the truth is that the years before kindergarten are essential for intellectual growth, and, by kindergarten, some kids might already be irreparably behind if they do not attend pre-school. Universal pre-school for America’s youngest citizens is perhaps the most effective and important economic measure we can take to improve our long-term economic growth. In a time when we are looking for ways to adapt to a rapidly changing and competitive world, it is essential to make sure that lower-income and middle-class Americans are not left behind before they even reach kindergarten.
Experts have demonstrated that the pre-kindergarten years are absolutely crucial for the formation of strong social and cognitive abilities. According to Professor James J. Heckman from the University  of Chicago, “Skill gaps (between children) open up early, before schooling begins, and…these gaps are major determinants of social and economic success.” Because of its major positive impact on America’s long-term stock of human capital, investing in early childhood education has few, if any, downsides. As Heckman has stated: “Investing in disadvantaged young children is a rare public policy with no equity-efficiency tradeoff. It reduces the inequality associated with the accident of birth and at the same time raises the productivity of society at large.”
A longitudinal study of children enrolled in a low-income pre-school program started in Michigan in the 1960s and followed for 40 years afterwards found that the public gained $12.90 for every $1.00 spent on the program. When we annualize this astounding 40-year payoff, we find that there was a yearly 12 to 13 percent rate of return from this pre-school program. Early childhood care and education has a higher return to unit dollar invested than any investing in skills at any other point in life, including schooling, college, and job training.
The importance of early childhood care and education inspired the creation of Head Start, America’s pre-school program for families in poverty. Head Start has reached hundreds of thousands of children since its creation in 1965, and although research on the subject has been mixed, most evaluations show that Head Start provides at least a reasonably positive benefit for its students. Yet, despite Head Start’s successes, there is still an enormous lack of quality childcare in America. The early childhood education system in the United States covers far less children than those in the rest of the developed world. Only 70 percent of American pre-school-aged children go to pre-school, while in most Western European countries the number is between 90 and 100 percent.
This low pre-school participation rate is because Head Start is a targeted program meant to reach those in poverty, but it is not nearly large enough to reach all children in need. Germany has kindergarten (which is comparable to American preschool) places for 93 percent of its children. In Belgium, enrollment begins at 2.5 years old and reaches almost 100 percent by age three, and France enrolls 100 percent of children from the age in the government-supported pre-schools from the age of three. These examples show that it is entirely feasible and realistic for the United   States to provide preschool for all of its youngest citizens, and it is an embarrassment that we are practically the only developed country without such a program.
Many Western European countries have followed a similar model, supplying universal pre-school services for all children and subsidizing the schooling for the poor. By providing universal pre-school, these systems ensure that most children start off with a decent childcare baseline. Considering the importance of early childhood for intellectual and social development, the lack of childcare early in life for many Americans has them starting out “behind” before they can even think for themselves.
From an economic perspective, universal pre-school would help create a far more fair society. Inequality is ingrained in every level of our educational system, but it is most pronounced in the early childhood years, where unlike the rest of their schooling years, students can’t even go if they do not have access to pre-school. Such a policy would lead to a nation more capable of building, innovating, and creating in future decades. Human capital is an essential factor in economic growth, and it is far easier and more efficient to increase skills and knowledge at a young age. America’s least educated and least-skilled workers have especially struggled during the current recession and are sure to continue to be challenged in a more competitive global economy; starting life with a strong skill set is absolutely necessary to succeed later in life.
We should now create a universal pre-school system in America that ensures that children do not start out life with massive disadvantages because of their parents’ stability or income and enhances their productivity for the rest of their lives.  Universal pre-school would an be enormously popular program because it provides a free and necessary service to the rich, the middle-class, and the poor, and thus it is often politically easier to create such a program than it is to create one just for the poor. A universal pre-school program that cost $50 billion would provide $86.6 billion in economic gain, and through increased human capital and decreased crime would create benefits for every American. By creating such a system, we can dramatically improve the lives of the least fortunate form their earliest years.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard dormitories often house lab rats and party animals. The girl next door might be as quiet as a mouse, and your roommate can sometimes be a pig.
In addition to these commonplace dorm residents, you may have a more surprising critter for a neighbor—a real live animal.
In dorms across Harvard, students are secretly raising animals, violating the College’s no-pets policy.
Small animals like hamsters, turtles, and fish are the most common. More exotic pets, including a python and chinchillas, have also found homes in Harvard undergraduates’ rooms. The Crimson has confirmed the presence of one rabbit and several cats—and rumors swirl about a pig residing in Adams and a dog that lived in the Quad a few years ago.
Pet owners say that these animals provide an offbeat conversation starter, comforting companionship, and a sense of home in a temporary living space. But if College administrators discover these residents’ secret sidekicks, students can be forced to relocate their pets and may even face disciplinary consequences.
WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE
A senior chuckles as Mashie II—his third hamster in three years—climbs the metal rungs of her cage, which fits snugly on his bookshelf.
“They love whipped cream,” he says, squirting some of the sugary confection onto his index finger.
In a dorm room nearby, another  rodent—a black rat named Behemoth—has a healthier favorite food: grapes. Raised in a household that kept as many as nine cats at a time, Behemoth’s owner has a convenient source of sustenance for her pet. “I steal a lot of rat food from the dining hall,” she admits.
Behemoth scrambles over her owner’s body and futon as her owner chatters to her, calling her names like “dear” and “buddy.”
“Can you not eat my statistics book?” she says, chiding her gently.
“I love having pets,” she says. “It’s a pretty good stress reliever. They aren’t going to complain to you about the p-set that they have due in 40 minutes.”
Some students look beyond mammals for creature comforts.
One senior kept his pet python, which he has had since sixth grade, in his room at Harvard during his sophomore year.
Though the four-foot-long python, named Monty, has been in residence with the student’s parents since the student moved out of his spacious DeWolfe suite, the python’s owner has fond memories of it slithering around the common room while he studied.
NO PETS ALLOWED
Despite the benefits of pet ownership, College policy expressly forbids pets in dorms.
The issue is addressed in one unequivocal sentence in the Handbook for Students: “No student may keep an animal in a building owned or leased by the College.”
Administrators cite several reasons for forbidding animals in the dorms.
“A concern, obviously, is the health issue. People might be allergic,” says Katie W. Steele, director for freshman programming. “Also, the health of the pet: Is a college dorm really the best place for it?”
During his time as resident dean of Lowell House, Secretary of the Administrative Board John “Jay” L. Ellison says that one student requested to keep a dog in her room.
“We just felt that having a dog in the House was not appropriate,” Ellison says. “Students are allergic to dogs and some are scared of dogs, and this is a place for [students] to be comfortable.”
Ellison adds that the transitional nature of student life is ill-suited to pet ownership, saying that some students have abandoned pets when they left for the summer.
Freshman proctors and resident tutors—who live at the College year-round and usually have larger rooms—are allowed to keep pets in their suites.
While administrators agree that pets are verboten for students, there is no clear penalty for students caught with pets in their dorms.
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 says that if a resident dean were to learn of an animal in a dorm, the first response would be “to make sure the pet has a new home.”
In addition, Dingman believes that the student might receive a Dean’s Warning—a disciplinary sanction which is reported to the Ad Board but requires no further action from the board.
In the case of the Lowell student with the dog, Ellison says that the student agreed to move off-campus in order to keep the pet.
He says that such cases only reach the Ad Board if the student refuses to cooperate with the House’s request to remove the pet.
Bryan J. Martin ’12 and James W. Nitze ’12 have experienced the College’s reaction to a pet firsthand. During his freshman year, Nitze purchased two chinchillas at a cost of about $200 each, he says. About a month later, he added two turtles to his dorm room menagerie.
The chinchillas—which Nitze describes as “a cross between a squirrel, a hamster, a guinea pig, and a bunny” with “the softest fur in the world”—lived in rodent luxury in Martin and Nitze’s sophomore room in Mather House. Nitze spent two weeks constructing a two-tier cage for the critters, a five-foot-tall structure complete with ramps, steps, a wheel, and a hammock.
When their building manager and resident dean learned of the rodents’ presence, the students were ordered to remove the animals as quickly as possible. Unsure where to take the pets, Nitze brought the cage to the Porcellian Club, where he left an explanatory note telling members: “Don’t panic.”
The chinchillas ate the note. When the perplexed final club authorities finally identified the creatures’ owner, they, too, demanded that the animals leave. Nitze’s brother, visiting from Washington, D.C., drove the chinchillas home.
Martin and Nitze’s run-in with the pet police has not stopped them from keeping animals in their room, though; today, the surviving member of the pair of turtles resides in a tank in their common room. Nitze says a resident tutor and a security guard have spotted the turtle, named Blarney, and have not complained.
“If they really made us get rid of this f—ing turtle, I just wouldn’t,” Nitze says. “It’s just so ridiculous.”
Some students go to great lengths to hide their pets. The rat owner says she keeps the curtains of her common room permanently closed to avoid detection, the python owner tied the snake in a pillowcase to move him in and out of DeWolfe, and many students requested anonymity for this story.
Others are less concerned with secrecy.
Maria F. Barragan-Santana ’14 says she thinks her proctor knows about the fish in her room. Her floor in Thayer conferred to determine the name of the fish, eventually christening it Colonel William Henry Thayer IV.
“It’s not like it’s going to walk out of my dorm,” Barragan-Santana says. “The worst thing that could happen is the bowl breaks. Then all you have is water all over the floor and a flopping fish.”
ANIMAL HOUSE
Caring for a pet can be a struggle for students, who must balance busy schedules, cramped quarters, and long breaks with an animal’s need for stable care.
Nitze, who spent winter break in New Zealand this year, realized just hours before his flight from Boston that he needed to buy food for Blarney before leaving. He raced to PetSmart, where he purchased five seven-day feeders to leave in the turtle’s tank.
“There’s this awful blizzard, but Blarney’s probably going to starve to death if I don’t leave something,” Nitze recalls thinking as he set off through the snow. The break was a success: “Not only did he survive, so did all the fish” who were sharing the tank at the time.
The hamster owner left a Tupperware container full of feed in Mashie II’s cage when he went home for two weeks this winter. He worried that the hamster might “turn stupid and not know where the food was,” but she survived.
Students also worry about the possibility of a pet escaping. “A couple times I forgot to close the cage,” the hamster owner admits. When Mashie I, a now-deceased hamster, once disappeared, her owner sealed the cracks along the walls of his room and put out dishes of food to try to lure her into the open.
After two days, the owner awoke in the night when he heard her scratching at his desk.
Martin, Nitze’s roommate, recalls that the chinchillas would “ram their heads through the cardboard flap” to try to escape from their cage.
One day, Nitze purposely let Franklin, one of the three chinchillas he has kept at Harvard, run around his common room.
While he was on the loose, Franklin chewed on a wire.
“He was sort of twitching,” Nitze recalls, then he “flopped over.”
Though Franklin survived unscathed, Nitze says that it was “the awfullest thing I’d ever seen.”
Beyond electrocution scares, others say that dorm rooms are not suited to keeping pets due to their small size.
The python owner only kept Monty in his room for the year that he lived in DeWolfe, where his snake could live in a large closet in his bedroom.
The rat owner agrees that small rooms are problematic for pet ownership. “I really wanted a cat,” she says, noting that her mother kept a cat in her own Harvard dorm room. (Breaking the no-pets policy “is a family tradition, I guess,” she says.) “But I thought that it would not be fair to a cat to live in such a small space.”
SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST
Some students see these difficulties as reasons to support the no-pets rule, while others wish that the policy was more lenient.
“I guess the school has to enforce a policy, because you can’t have everyone in a dorm keeping ferrets. It would get all messy and smelly,” Nitze says.
The rat owner says that she supports the rule against pets, even though she is breaking it.
“I think the College policy, while probably not intended for the welfare of pets, helps out because college students are generally irresponsible and probably wouldn’t take the best care of a pet,” she says.
The student who kept a python believes that caged animals such as rodents and reptiles should be permitted.
Barragan-Santana also supports a policy that would allow certain types of animals.
“I don’t see why we shouldn’t be able to have fish,” she says.
The hamster owner says he resents the fact that tutors in his House can officially keep pets, while he must hide his hamster: During winter break, he left her in her cage under his bed, along with his contraband microwave.
“They’re only three or four years older than us,” he says. “It doesn’t seem like a very fair rule.”
Nitze insists that his chinchillas were well-treated in his dorm room. “They were really clean. We took care of them—they were living in real style.”
Yet that did not sway House staff’s demand that the animals go, he says. “Without asking any questions, they made us get rid of the chinchillas.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Parents of the Class of 2012 flocked to Harvard’s campus this weekend for the annual Junior Parents Weekend.
Mothers and fathers participated in activities including tours of Widener Library, luncheons in each of the Houses, and numerous presentations in Sanders Theatre—and reliving their college experiences by joining the Harvard social scene.
“I taught my parents how to play Civil War, and the three of us are really good at it,” Marie R. Appel ’12 said.
Appel, her nine roommates, and several of her friends organized a beer pong tournament for their visiting parents on Saturday night, in perhaps one of the more unusual ways of commemorating the conclusion of Junior Parents Weekends.
“My Lord, it was one of the most relaxing, fun, crazy things we’ve done in a long time,” Appel’s mother, Mimi, said of the weekend in general. “It was a ball. I love exactly how it worked out.”
Junior Parents Weekend, jointly organized by the Office of Student Life and the Crimson Key Society, began on Friday morning with a schedule of open houses, receptions, tours, and speakers.
Parents were invited to Sanders Theatre on Friday evening to listen to a welcome address from University President Drew G. Faust. The event, which also featured Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson and a panel of seniors discussing their Harvard experience and future plans, was one of the most well-attended of the weekend, according to Daniel P. Bicknell ’13, the Crimson Key Society’s co-coordinator of Junior Parents Weekend.
Bicknell added that lectures on Saturday afternoon, especially those by Kennedy School Professor Roger B. Porter and Medical School Professor Nicholas A. Christakis, were also popular among the parents.
“The relevant topics and the professors themselves attracted most of the parents,” Bicknell said.
Numerous receptions and open houses provided parents with multiple other options for their unstructured periods of time.
But the weekend’s scheduling at the height of midterm season concerned many juniors.
“[My friends and I] didn’t have that much time for work,” said Abigail A. Schachter ’12, who said she has four midterms this coming week. “Maybe after spring break or maybe late toward the end of the year would have been better timing.”
Still, many students, including Appel and Shadman S. Zaman ’12, considered the highlights of the weekend not be those events scheduled by the University, but instead the rare opportunities the weekend allowed for parents, classmates, and friends to interact.
Zaman said meeting his roommates’ parents enabled him to understand his roommates in a much different way.
“When you talk to someone’s parents, you can kind of gauge where they get their personalities and mannerisms from,” Zaman said. “You assume your friends have really unique personalities, which they do, but when you meet their parents ... it’s really funny.”
By junior year, parents and students are more accustomed to and familiar with college life, and both agreed that the second visit organized by the University varied substantially from Freshman Parents Weekend.
But while much changed between visits to campus, at least one parent said she learned one lesson in the fall of 2008 that has stuck with her since.
“Did we rub on John Harvard’s toe this time?” Mimi Appel said. “Absolutely not.”

In the first of a series of lectures dedicated to the memory of Ilya Chalik ’11, Shaolin Master Monk Shi Dezun presented on how to live a fulfilling life through zen, martial arts, and medicine.
Chalik, who passed away on Feb. 13, was the co-president of the Harvard Tai Chi Tiger Crane Club Shaolin Cultural Foundation, which is co-hosting the lecture series with Chalik’s Adams House and the Shaolin Center of Quincy.
In opening the lecture, both Tai Chi Club co-president Linfeng Yang ’11 and John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67, Adams House Master and the faculty adviser for the club, noted Chalik’s genuine interest in learning about different faiths and belief systems.
Palfrey emphasized the importance of integrating cross-cultural beliefs in the development of areas such as medicine, athletics, and the arts.
“Because of [Chalik’s] experiences in these variety of cultures and religious beliefs, he was able to touch people with a common kind of humanity and love,” Palfrey said.
After a moment of silence held in memory of Chalik, Shi demonstrated kung fu moves, fluidly traversing the stage in Yenching Auditorium.
Shi, a 31st-generation monk of the Buddhist Shaolin Temple, then delivered a keynote address in Mandarin, with an English interpreter, focusing on zen, martial arts, and medicine.
Despite the difficulties of communicating zen through words, he said the understanding of zen is integral for comprehending eastern and Chinese cultures,
“Zen is a concept that can be intuitively understood, but not talked about,” Shi said.
He said zen, martial arts, and meditation are ways for people to fulfill and realize their own lives, describing meditation as a firewall or an anti-virus software that helps people detect and reject bad habits.
“It is through the pain, the suffering of self-cultivation that you make yourself independently perfect,” Shi said. “It has nothing to do with fighting someone.”
Following Shi’s presentation, Palfrey moderated a discussion panel on zen, martial arts, medicine, and the importance of pluralism.
In addition to Shi, Adams House graduate Brian S. Gillis ’08 and Sergeant Kevin P. Bryant, diversity and community liaison for the Harvard University Police Department, participated on the panel.
Bryant, a baptist minister and practitioner of martial arts for over 20 years, said that martial arts originated for him as a method of self-defense, but has become a way of life.
Gillis, a graduate student of interfaith relations and comparative religion at Columbia University, dedicated his final thoughts to Chalik’s openness to different faiths.
“One of the best memories we can say about him is that we can do the same,” Gillis said.

Toronto Maple Leafs President and General Manager Brian P. Burke hosted a conversation at Harvard Law School on Friday, telling a crowd of students and hockey fans that concussions were an inevitable “occupational risk” in hockey but that the National Hockey League was “ahead of the curve” in dealing with them.
The first issue discussed by Burke—a 1981 graduate of the Law School—was that of concussions, which have emerged as a topic of hot debate in the sport. Acknowledging that hockey is a full contact sport played in a small area with no out of bounds, he said that players need to be accountable for protecting themselves when they are on the ice.
Burke dismissed the idea of adding more protective gear to players’ uniforms, saying that more protection could be counterproductive by increasing the level of violence in the game.
“Every piece of equipment is a weapon. A helmet is a weapon,” he said.
But Burke added that he believed the NHL was doing a more comprehensive job of diagnosing and treating concussions, particularly compared to other sports leagues like the NFL.
After graduating from Providence College as captain of the hockey team, Burke played one full year in the minor-league American Hockey League. His season was “unspectacular,” Burke said, and he entered Harvard Law School in 1978,
During his time at Harvard, Burke enjoyed playing on the Business School rugby team, he said. However, he said he was apathetic towards his time at Harvard, calling it “way more intimidating than it needed to be.”
Since graduation, Burke has held many positions in the NHL, serving as the general manager for four teams, as well as for the silver medal U.S. men’s team in the 2010 Winter Olympics.
On Friday, Burke discussed the pros and cons of being a GM, talking about both the joy of landing a great trade and the lack of job security, saying “you’re as good as your last season, and sometimes as your last game.”
Several in attendance said they found Burke’s words and charismatic persona inspiring.
“He showed how important personality is,” said second-year law student Robin A. Kelley.
Third-year student Benjamin J. Glicksman added that he appreciated Burke’s unique perspective.
“It was a great opportunity for people in the Law School to see someone who’s using their degree in a different way from going to a law firm,” said Glickman, president of the Committee on Sports and Entertainment Law.
But despite all his successes, Burke cautioned students against taking the same route as him, citing the difficulty and competition of his profession.
“Make goddamned sure you have a legal skill that will feed your family besides sports law,” he said.

The Cambridge Police Department, in cooperation with Somerville police and Mass. State Police, made 15 arrests in a citywide warrant sweep last Thursday.
The sweep, dubbed “Operation March Madness,” began at 5 a.m. and concluded at noon.
Of the 15 arrests, six were for violent offenses, including armed robbery and armed assaults. Four people were arrested for larcenies.
Two were for drug possession and distribution, and three were arrested for driving offenses, according to the Cambridge police.
Cambridge police conduct large sweeps at least once a year and some additional sweeps throughout the year are done on a smaller scale, said Daniel M. Riviello, the spokesperson for the department.
“Lots of warrants build up so large sweeps become necessary,” Riviello said. “It is our obligation to make these arrests.”
The operation was conducted by a team of over 30 detectives, a special response entry team, crisis negotiators, and crime scene services, according to Riviello.
Police spread throughout the city to make the arrests during the seven-hour sweep. Police made six arrests between 6 and 7 a.m.
All but one of the individuals were Cambridge residents, and one of the apprehended people did not have a known address.
The occurrence of sweeps varies depending on availability of personnel and knowledge in the department.
“I think part of it is based on manpower and having the intelligence of where people are at a certain time,” Riviello said.
One officer suffered a minor injury in his leg during a forced entry.
The defendant was charged with resisting arrest and disorderly conduct in addition to warrants for assault and battery and larceny.

Russell W. Simmons and two other record industry executives credited religion and God as the keys to their success in the entertainment industry at a discussion at the Harvard Law School Saturday.
The Harvard Black Law Students Association and the Hip Hop Entertainment Law Project hosted the event, titled “Be the ULTIMATE BALLER: How to be Your Best Self.”
An entertainment and business tycoon who co-founded Def Jam Recordings, Simmons joined fellow panelists Drew Rives, a regional marketing manager for Island Def Jam Music Group, and LaRonn Harris, an Atlantic Records regional promotion manager.
Harris spoke primarily about the role religion played in his path to success.
“The major thing that I wanted to communicate today is that God is real and you have to have faith in everything that you do,” Harris said.
Upon joining the panel 45 minutes late, Simmons echoed Harris’ earlier sentiments about the critical importance of religion, referring several times to his most recent book “Super Rich: A Guide to Having It All.”
Simmons signed copies of the book for audience members after the discussion.
Simmons also attributed hard work, dedication, resilience, and focus as other components of success.
Alea J. Mitchell, a second-year student at Harvard Law School and member of HBLSA, said the speakers were inspiring for a crowd eager to learn from the panelists’ achievements.
“When Mr. Simmons finally came and he was speaking about peace and looking within, it’s the stuff that mentees need to hear,” Mitchell said.
The panelists opened up the discussion to questions from the audience, and Simmons also addressed the entrepreneurs and writers in the crowd.
To the aspiring music writers, Simmons advised them not to hesitate to express their sentiments in their work.
A mentee of Simmons, Rives said he appreciated participating in the event alongside his “father” Simmons and “brother” Harris.
“The audience was very interactive,” Rives said. “I enjoyed the questions and even got a couple laughs,” he said. “I thought everyone would be serious.”
High school students participating in a Tufts University volunteer program also attended the event.
Second-year Law School student Sean A. Hill, who coordinated the event, said HBLSA chose Simmons as a panelist because the group wanted to attract youth from the area.
Hill said “there was a lot of ‘real talk’” coming from the panelists, who overcame social and financial obstacles to achieve success in the entertainment industry.
“That’s great because a lot of kids can relate to that,” Hill said. “A lot of kids can relate to the background of Mr. Simmons and Mr. Harris.”
The event was part of HBLSA’s 28th annual spring conference, this year titled “Empowerment: Effective Leadership Within and Outside Our Communities.”

The Undergraduate Council voted to create a new $500 award for exceptional first-year advising during its general meeting last night.
The award, which is scheduled to begin next year with the Class of 2015, was created in an effort to stimulate better freshmen advising.
In the legislation, which passed unanimously, the UC called first-year advising “the most under-appreciated and over-looked level of advising in the Harvard undergraduate advising system.”
The Undergraduate Council plans to solicit nominations from students, which will then be reviewed by the UC Education Committee, according to Phillip Z. Yao ’13, a co-sponsor of the award act.
The decision will then take into account both the volume of recommendations an adviser receives, as well as the quality of the recommendations.
“We want to give advisers an incentive,” Yao said. “This will give them something to look forward to.”
According to Yao, conversations with the Advising Programs Office (APO) have revealed that they believe this award has the potential to inspire improvement in advising, and, if publicized properly, could have a positive effect.
The award will not be given out until the end of the next academic year, so that the UC has time to publicize it.
“We didn’t want to do it this year because didn’t want to rush into it,” Yao said.
“It is important that not only advisers, but also that students, are aware of it,” he said.
Although there are four advisers who comprise an incoming freshman’s academic advising network, only the student’s freshman academic adviser will be eligible for the award.
Peer Advising Fellows, proctors, and resident deans will not be considered.
These advisers have the opportunity to be honored for exceptional performance through the John Marquand Award, a separate award that is jointly administered by the APO and UC. The Marquand Award recognizes excellence and dedication in the guidance of Harvard undergraduates.
While the award does not officially have a name, Yao said that the UC is thinking about naming the award after its first recipient next year.
Yao said that he hopes this is the first step in a continued effort by the Council to improve advising on campus.
In particular, Yao said, the UC would like to enhance the process for matching freshmen with their advisers.

Former Harvard Kennedy School Dean Joseph S. Nye Jr. met with Col. Muammar al-Gaddafi of Libya two times during the past four years and helped the colonel’s son with his doctoral thesis, Nye wrote in an e-mail to The Crimson yesterday.
Monitor Consulting Group, a Cambridge-based firm formed by several Harvard professors, has come under fire for working for Gaddafi and accepting $250,000 a month from 2006 to 2008 for its services, according to the Boston Globe.
In 2007, Monitor Group offered Nye an all-expense-paid trip to Libya so that he could give a speech on globalization and meet the colonel, Nye wrote in the e-mail.
“I was curious to see what Qaddafi was like,” Nye wrote in an e-mail. “Bad leaders are as interesting a topic for research as good leaders.”
After his meeting in 2007, Nye wrote an article about his meeting with Gaddafi for The New Republic, arguing at the time that the autocrat “seems to have become interested in soft power—the art of projecting influence through attraction rather than corrosion.”
“Since this was a period when Qaddafi had given up his nuclear program, was inviting American government officials to Libya, and appeared to be changing his international strategy, I thought my impressions were worth reporting,” Nye, who is a distinguished service professor at Harvard, wrote in the e-mail.
Nye said he also used some of the interview material for one of his books on leadership.
Gaddafi and Nye met again in October 2008 when Monitor Group asked Nye to join a group of experts in charge of explaining the world financial crisis to the colonel.
“The meeting lasted a few hours. I doubt we were very successful,” wrote Nye.
Nye also advised Gaddafi’s son Seif al-Islam Gaddafi on one chapter of his doctoral thesis at the London School of Economics at the request of a friend, Nye wrote, adding that he “frequently agrees” to such requests.
“I found the chapter intelligent as were Seif’s responses to my criticisms. He thanks me in the preface,” he wrote.
The London School of Economics has recently opened an investigation into the 2007 Ph.D. thesis, after allegations surfaced that it may have been plagiarized or ghost-written, according to the New York Times.
“I gather from the press that questions have been raised at LSE about Seif’s authorship of the thesis, but I do not know anything about that since I only commented on one chapter,” Nye wrote.
In spite of Nye’s meetings with Gaddafi, Nye wrote in the e-mail that he does not support the Gaddafi regime.
“At no time have I supported the Qaddafi regime, and I am on record as hoping for their swift overthrow,” he wrote.
Nye was not the only Kennedy School professor to meet with Gaddafi. Public Policy Professor Robert D. Putnam also met with the colonel in January 2007 to discuss political and economical reforms.

Former Lebanese presidential candidate Chibli Mallat spoke about the waves of unrest that are sweeping the Middle East on Friday evening at the Center for Government and International Studies, encouraging audience members to support what he called “a human rights revolution.”
Throughout the lecture and in the subsequent seminar, Mallat, a visiting professor of Islamic legal studies at Harvard Law School, emphasized his belief that a philosophy of nonviolence underlies the movements opposing authoritarian regimes in countries such as Egypt, Tunisia, and Libya.
“Democracy is another form of nonviolence,” he said.
Once these movements succeed in toppling dictators, Mallat said that the people have the opportunity to express their views of society by reforming or rewriting existing constitutions.
Despite his optimism regarding the ongoing protests, Mallat also expressed worry about the violent manner in which the regime of Muammar al-Gaddafi has responded to opposition in Libya. He urged the establishment of a “no-fly zone” by Western governments to prevent further deaths and warned of a “bloodbath” if Gaddafi’s forces are able to regain control of rebellious regions.
Furthermore, Mallat expressed his hope that, if Gaddafi is removed from power, he will face an international tribunal for crimes against humanity.
The former presidential candidate highlighted the universal nature of the values and the desires underpinning unrest in the Middle East.
“This is not an Arab revolution,” he said. “It is not a Middle Eastern revolution. It is a world revolution.”
Mallat urged the Harvard community and the West to go beyond mere words and actively support democratic movements in the Middle East.
He pointed to the example of a group of students at the Law School who have made recommendations as to how the Egyptian constitution might be amended.
Mallat is no stranger to confronting power. In 1992, he was briefly imprisoned in Iran after helping to organize international monitoring of elections in Iraq.
In 2005, he was a leading figure of the Cedar Revolution in Lebanon, which sought to replace the heavily pro-Syrian government with a more independent leadership following the assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
Leonard Wood, a student at Harvard Law School, said after the event that Mallat is uniquely qualified to comment on current events.
“Professor Mallat has been one of a handful of leading scholars who have focused on the importance of developing popular protests and peaceful resistance,” he said.
For his part, Lebanese student Dany Jradi ’14, praised Mallat’s ability to reach out to people with different ideological inclinations.
“He’s not addressing one extreme view. He’s trying to bring different views together,” he said.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction.
CORRECTION: MAR. 7, 2011
The Mar. 7 article "Chibli Mallat, Former Lebanese Presidential Candidate, Discusses Gaddafi, Middle East Revolutions" incorrectly stated that Mallat had been jailed in Iraq. In fact, he was jailed in Iran after supervising elections in Iraq.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard women basketball’s hopes for the Ivy League title were crushed Saturday night by Princeton. The Crimson (17-10, 9-4 Ivy) entered this weekend’s road trip needing to win games against Penn (11-16, 5-8) Friday and the Tigers (23-4, 12-1) Saturday. Harvard kept its hopes alive with a win against Penn, but the team’s defensive mistakes kept it from success at Jadwin Gymnasium in New Jersey.
Disappointment was the word on everyone’s lips.
“We’re pretty disappointed with the weekend,” said Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith. “We got a win [Friday] night at Penn and thought we were going to be able to get a win at Princeton.”
PRINCETON 68, HARVARD 59
“It was a win we definitely could have gotten,” co-captain Christine Matera said.
After coming off of a victory the night before, the Crimson could not match up to the Tigers in its final game of the regular season.
The Crimson women performed well offensively, with four players tallying double-digit figures. Matera led the squad with 13 points, including three three-pointers. Junior Brogan Berry and sophomore Victoria Lippert each scored 12 points, and freshman Christine Clark netted 11 as well.
“Emma [Markley] didn’t play a lot, and she’s generally a big scorer for us,” Delaney-Smith said. “Her leg really flared up tonight and was in a lot of pain, so she wasn’t able to help us out statistically.”
Harvard’s offense was 40.4 percent from the field, while Princeton’s was 43.5 percent. The Crimson had a couple of big three-pointers to stay in the game—though shooting 38.9 percent from downtown—and edged out the Tigers in rebounds, 40-39.
Princeton took a 12-4 lead six minutes into the game, but the Crimson battled back with a 9-0 run. The Tigers moved the ball well, capitalizing on rebounds and scoring 17 points total off of Harvard turnovers. Princeton went on a 6-0 run just before the half to make it 32-26.
In the second period, Matera started off on a tear, scoring five times in five minutes. The Tigers came right back, bringing the score in their favor to 53-49. On a string of Harvard turnovers, Princeton widened the gap using a 10-2 run to set the score at 63-52 with just over three minutes left. Despite baskets from Berry and Clark, the Tigers held onto their lead, extending the Crimson’s deficit to 12 points.
“[Princeton] definitely came out strong and scored on our turnovers,” Berry said. “They’re a good transition team and they really took advantage of us in that sense. We weren’t able to make quick enough adjustments.”
Delaney-Smith cited three main errors: bad transitions, missing box-outs, and lack of focus.
“It was a very close ball game. It wasn’t over until it was over,” Delaney-Smith said. “But you don’t play a team to try to stay in the race and make those kinds of errors. Unfortunately, we did.”
HARVARD 56, PENN 48
Friday night had a better ending for Harvard at the Palestra in Philadelphia, Pa. After being down at the half, the Crimson squad regrouped in the locker room and came out strong to grab the victory.
“It was a classic matchup with a team trying to stay in the race and a team not in the race,” Delaney-Smith said.
The young Penn squad surprised Harvard with a 7-0 lead just over two minutes into the game. The Quakers maintained their lead throughout the half—up by 11 at one point—until a three-pointer from Lippert cut the deficit to 30-22.
“We came out really flat, and Penn came out really hard,” Berry said. “They got up on us early, and it took halftime for us to recollect.”
Besides the bad defensive start, the Crimson shot only 29.2 percent at the half, while the Quakers sank 50 percent of their shots.
After halftime, Harvard started to lock down on defense and improved its passing and transitions, capitalizing on Penn’s turnovers.  The Crimson also scored five points in 45 seconds to bring its deficit to just three points.
“We gutted it out,” Matera said. “We started to D-up, and we were able to take the lead.”
Matera hit a couple of three-pointers to tie the game at 39, and with three and a half minutes to play, sophomore Jasmine Evans made a lay-up that brought Harvard on top for the first time of the night. The Crimson remained ahead until time ran out, extending its lead to eight points.
“I want to credit our players for being poised and patient.” Delaney-Smith said. “We staged a great comeback and did what we needed to do on both ends.”

A late Cornell charge fell just short, allowing the Harvard women’s lacrosse team to come away with its first win of the season as the Crimson defeated the Big Red, 13-12, on Saturday at Schoellkopf Field.
“Cornell is a great Ivy League opponent, and it has always been an emotional game when we’ve played them,” tri-captain Sam McMahon said. “We knew this was going to be a physical, emotional, and mental game for both sides with [each team] giving all they can for 60 minutes.”
After taking a 13-8 lead with 7:33 remaining, the Big Red (1-2, 0-1 Ivy) stormed back with four goals, cutting the lead to 13-12 with 27 seconds remaining. But the Crimson (1-1, 1-0) held on, using  the ensuing draw control to run out the clock and secure the win.
Harvard was led in scoring by sophomore Jennifer VanderMeulen and tri-captain Melanie Baskind, who had four and three goals, respectively.
“I just came into the game ready to go,” VanderMeulen said. “After losing to Stanford, we needed a big win, and Cornell was a great opportunity, especially being [an] Ivy [game]. I think I just fed off the energy of the big game.”
The match started off with a quick goal by VanderMeulen 34 seconds in. The Big Red’s Shannon McHugh struck back with two goals over the next five minutes, making the score 2-1 in Cornell’s favor.
The Crimson then went on a 3-0 run spanning two minutes with goals from Baskind, VanderMeulen, and freshman Jenn Leffew.
Over the next ten minutes of the game, both teams began trading goals, resulting in a 6-4 Harvard lead with 12:07 remaining in the first half.
Cornell responded with three consecutive goals capped off by another score from McHugh—who finished with a team-leading three goals.
Thanks to the late Big Red run, Cornell went into halftime up, 7-6.
“We needed to regain focus and work together collectively on both sides of the ball,” McMahon said. “There was a lack of communication and focus amongst the defense in the first half.”
The Crimson came out running to start the second half, scoring six consecutive goals, giving Harvard a commanding 12-5 lead with 13:50 remaining in the game.
Junior Jess Halpern, Baskind, and VanderMeulen each scored two goals in the run. VanderMeulen notched her first score off a free-position shot after being fouled going to goal, then converted a pass from freshman Chelsey Newman for her second.
“Going into the second half, I knew we needed a push because we were all a little deflated from being down by one,” VanderMeulen said. “I knew I had to step up and fill a leadership role on attack.”
The Crimson played solid defense as well, holding Cornell scoreless until 8:30 remained, when Big Red junior Olivia Knotts put one away.
“We came out much stronger in the second half as Cornell didn’t score until there was about eight minutes left in the game,” McMahon said. “We were playing better on-ball defense, off-ball defense, and the correct rotations. We made some stands and [junior golie] Kerry Clark made some incredible and key saves to keep [us] ahead.”
Sophomore Danielle Tetreault responded to the Knott’s goal with one of her own, making the score 13-8 with seven and a half minutes remaining in the game.
But Cornell would not give in.
The Big Red charged back with four consecutive goals, pulling within one on a score by junior Jessi Steinberg with 27 seconds remaining.”
“Of course [you] gets nervous when your lead starts to shrink and the other team seems to be making a comeback, but we just knew the [upcoming] draw control was critical,” McMahon said.
With the score 13-12, VanderMeulen faced off on a key draw. If she won the draw the Crimson could simply run out the clock and end Cornell’s dramatic comeback.
Vandermeulen won the draw control, allowing Harvard to run out the clock and seal the victory.
“The game was very emotional, and big momentum swings allowed both teams to go on scoring run,” Baskind said. “Being consistent is definitely something we’re working on and will need to figure out…I think we were successful today because we stepped up when we needed to most.”
The Crimson would have preferred to not have to sweat out the final moments, but at the end of the day, the team was pleased to win its first game of the season against a quality conference opponent.
“Hustle, determination, possession, and communication were keys to the victory today, McMahon said. “Obviously getting the win was great for us. There are certainly things we need to work on over the course of the week before we play Penn on our home turf next Saturday.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In one of wrestling’s biggest weekends of the year, Harvard (2-15) left it all on the mat at the EIWA Championships this weekend. The two-day event at the Sojka Pavilion in Lewisburg, Pa., on Saturday and Sunday was what the season was all about for a young Crimson team.
“Everything we do comes down to this week,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said.
Overall, Harvard finished 10th out of 13 teams in the championship with 47.5 points. Cornell wiped out the competition, winning the championship with 173.5 points. Lehigh came in second with 119 points, followed closely by Rutgers in third place with 116.5 points.
“I think we did OK,”  sophomore co-captain Walter Peppelman said. “Everyone wrestled hard.”
Co-captain Andrew Knapp seemed to have similar feelings. While pleased with the effort of the team, he still thought the team had some improvements to make.
“We didn’t quite do as well as we wanted to,” Knapp said.
The Crimson’s highest finisher for the weekend was fifth-seeded sophomore Steven Keith, who finished in fourth place in the 125-lb. bracket. After an 11-4 win over Brown’s Teodoro Popilizio in the first round, Keith lost a tight 6-5 match to Navy’s fourth-seeded Aaron Kalil.
But Keith battled back in the consolation matchups, picking up a 6-2 victory over American’s seventh-seeded Naryman Arujau and another win over Princeton’s third-seeded Garret Frey. Despite the momentum from the wins, Keith fell again, 8-1, to Kalil in the third place matchup to take home fourth place.
“Steven’s one of our toughest guys,” Knapp said. “He wrestles the way you’re supposed to wrestle.”
The only Harvard wrestler to make it to the semifinals after the first day was Peppelman, the third seed in his weight class (157 lbs.). Peppelman won his first match easily with a pin in just 32 seconds over Franklin & Marshall’s Eric Norgard.
“I was pleased with my first match,” Peppelman said.
Despite a 6-1 victory over Princeton’s sixth-seeded Daniel Kolodzik in the quarterfinals, Peppelman said he was not as content with his performance in this second match. Peppelman went on to drop his semifinal match to Navy’s second-seeded Bryce Saddoris in a 5-1 loss.
Going into Sunday’s matches, Peppelman had a simple strategy.
“Wrestle hard,” said Peppelman, who will compete in the NCAA Championships starting next Thursday, March 17.
After dropping his first consolation semifinal match to Cornell’s DJ Meagher, Peppelman earned fifth place, pulling off a quick pin in 37 seconds against the Tigers’ Kolodzik.
“I think that he’s going to rebound from this,” said Knapp, looking ahead to next week’s NCAA Championships.
Knapp, the eighth seed at 285 lbs., was the last wrestler to have a chance to place as high as third going into Sunday’s matches.
Knapp was pinned 3:10 into his quarterfinal match against No. 1 Zachery Rey from Lehigh. Knapp rebounded with a 14-0 major decision win over Army’s Christian Botero, his largest victory of the year.
Knapp followed up this victory with a 2-0 sudden victory over Pennsylvania’s fifth-seeded Kyle Cowan, which set up his consolation semifinal matchup with Rutgers’  Dominick Russo III. Knapp lost this match 5-1, and then lost his fifth-place match to Cornell’s seventh-seeded Stryker Lane 2-0, giving him a sixth-place finish for the weekend.
Freshman Cameron Croy, the sixth seed, won his first match at 184 pounds, but then lost his next match against Navy’s third-seeded Luke Rebertus. Croy rebounded to finish seventh in his weight class. Sophomore Shay Warren also finished in seventh place at 133 pounds.
For the Crimson, senior Fermin Mendez, freshmen Joseph Marino, Erik Gobbo and Ian Roy, and junior Bryan Panzano all lost their only two matches of the weekend at 141, 149, 165, 174 and 197 lbs., respectively.
Despite mixed reactions from some of the wrestlers, Weiss said having so many young wrestlers compete in such a big tournament would be a good experience. Harvard only had two seniors compete at this year’s EIWA Championship, while the majority of its wrestlers this weekend were underclassmen.
The Crimson now looks ahead to the NCAA Championships in Philadelphia, Pa., where Keith and Peppelman will represent Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A season full of struggles is quickly becoming a distant memory for the Harvard men’s hockey team.
In a best-of-three series, the 10th-seeded Crimson (11-19-1, 7-14-1 ECAC) only needed two games to knock off seventh-seeded Clarkson (15-19-2, 9-12-1) at Cheel Arena in the first round of the ECAC playoffs. Harvard began the series with a 2-1 win on Friday night and didn’t look back, taking the Saturday contest, 6-4.
“We did pretty well,” said co-captain and defenseman Chris Huxley. “No matter what happened, we stuck with the game plan: get pucks in deep and see if we end up getting shots on that.”
With the two victories, the Crimson extended its winning streak to five games, the team’s longest since 2005. Harvard will continue its playoff run next week in an ECAC quarterfinals matchup against Dartmouth.
HARVARD 6, CLARKSON 4
After a low-scoring contest Friday night, neither team could find the back of the net in the first period of Saturday’s game.
That all changed in the second frame. In just a 15-minute interval, the Golden Knights scored three times, and Harvard answered twice.
Only 2:29 in, Clarkson defensemen Nik Pokulok fired a shot from the blue line that flew past senior goaltender Ryan Carroll to put the Golden Knights up by one. Less than two minutes later, Harvard responded, with senior forward Pier-Olivier Michaud tying the score at one apiece.
After Clarkson scored again, the Crimson quickly followed suit.
At the 13:40 mark, sophomore forward Alex Fallstrom managed to deflect a shot pass from junior forward Alex Killorn into the net.
In the back-and-forth battle, the home team regained the lead just 11 seconds after the Fallstrom goal, retaining the lead until the end of the period.
But at the end of the second period, Pokulok earned a game misconduct for contact to the head, giving Harvard a five-minute power play.
And the Crimson took advantage.
Three minutes into the power play, Huxley received a pass at the blue line and quickly sent the puck towards junior forward Daniel Moriarty, who had positioned himself at the right side of the net. The forward then tipped the puck past the Golden Knights goaltender to knot the score at three apiece.
“I saw [Moriarty] back door, and I just tried to give him a shot pass,” Huxley said. “He did a great job tipping it in.”
Moriarty struck again less than a minute later to give Harvard the lead for good.
“They really were huge,” said co-captain and forward Michael Del Mauro of Moriarty’s goals. “His ability to get out there and really bear down and score two goals at that point in the game was huge.”
The Crimson tacked on two more goals in the period while Clarkson found the back of the net once, giving the visitors the 6-4 victory and the series sweep.
Overall, the Harvard captains were pleased with the team’s play on Saturday night.
“I couldn’t even go through the number of guys who backchecked to change odd-man rushes in [Clarkson’s] favor to actually outnumbering them and catching them before the blue line,” Del Mauro said. “Everybody really stepped up.”
“I’ll give [Clarkson] credit. They came out and played hard, but we just stuck with the game plan and kept going,” Huxley added. “And it worked for us.”
HARVARD 2, CLARKSON 1
While five different Crimson players scored on Saturday, it was the Biega brothers who put the team on their back on Friday.
The game began auspiciously for Harvard. Just 3:32 into the contest, Fallstrom made a key pass to sophomore defenseman Danny Biega at the blue line. Biega managed to thread the puck through the legs of the Clarkson goaltender to give Harvard the early lead.
“It was a good goal,” Huxley said. “To get the first goal is important to get a little momentum going…We wanted to get people and pucks to the net, and that’s what we did.”
Neither team scored for the next 40 minutes, thanks in large part to strong defensive play. Carroll keyed the Crimson back line’s strong play, stopping 32 of the 33 shots that came his way.
“Ryan played great,” Del Mauro said. “He saw a lot of shots, and he really didn’t give up much, obviously on goals but also for rebounds.”
But Harvard’s back line couldn’t keep the home team off the board entirely. Just over four minutes into the final period, the Golden Knights evened the game at one apiece.
The tie proved to be short-lived, after the elder brother, senior forward Michael Biega, snuck a shot by the Clarkson netminder. The goal proved to be game-winning, as the Crimson held on for a narrow 2-1 victory.
“It was a crucial goal,” Del Mauro said. “[He] really just beat the goalie with a great shot.”
The victory in the first game of the series gave the visitors the momentum, which spilled over into the second game.
“I’m not saying we still didn’t have urgency, but it takes a little pressure off knowing you have a win under your belt, and you just need to stay the course,” Huxley said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is the second consecutive year that a freshman has become the Collegiate Squash Association (CSA) women’s individual champion. Last year, Harvard’s Laura Gemmell started her collegiate career with a perfect season, going 16-0 in the regular season and winning the 2010 Individual championship title.
This year, after a second undefeated regular season, it appeared that Gemmell would once again walk away with the national title and Ramsay Cup.
But the sophomore was unable to repeat last year’s performance, losing, 3-0, to Yale freshman Millie Tomlinson.
“It was definitely sad to see one of our own not winning this year,” sophomore Sarah Mumanachit said. “But it’s exciting to see new players coming into the college squash circuit each year and really bringing the level up and setting the bar even higher.”
“I think the pressure is lower as a freshmen, when you first come into college squash, so the expectations are lower as well,” captain Alisha Mashruwala added.
Tomlinson—who played No. 2 in Yale’s lineup this past season—entered the weekend’s tournament with a 15-1 regular-season record and advanced to the finals with a series of 3-0 wins. Gemmell advanced past her first round with a 3-0 win against Princeton’s Alexis Saunders. Cornell’s Jaime Laird proved to be a tougher opponent, but Gemmell ultimately won, 3-1, and came back with two more 3-0 wins in the quarter and semifinals.
In yesterday’s first game of the finals, Tomlinson took a quick 4-1 lead, but Gemmell fought back to tie things up at 10 points each. Tomlinson outlasted the sophomore, 12-10.
In the second set, Tomlinson again took an early lead that she never lost, winning, 11-3.
The third game was as close as the first, with Gemmell at one point tying the score, 9-9. Tomlinson was able to hold on and won, 11-9.
It was nearly an all-Crimson final as Harvard junior Nirasha Guruge was pitted against Tomlinson in the semifinal match. But the Yale player defeated Guruge, 3-0, winning the sets, 12-10, 11-6, and 11-4.
“Nirasha played probably the best squash I’ve ever seen her play before,” Mashruwala said. “She went in there, she was in it to win, and she blew everyone’s mind with the squash that she played. I’m very, very proud of her.”
Guruge made it to the semifinal round for the first time in her three years on the team by beating Yale’s No. 1 player, Logan Greer, 3-2.
“Nirasha’s a great player,” Mumanachit said. “She’s had some tough matches this season, but I really think that she proved her potential this tournament and I hope that she’s happy with her results.  She had a great win against one of the Yale girls in the quarters. She was down two games and came back and fought hard to win the match in five against [Greer].”
“I just went into the match thinking if I win, I win, if I lose, I lose, because that’s what my coach always tells me,” Guruge said.
Gemmell and Guruge were not the only players representing Harvard in this past weekend’s CSA championship. The team sent seven of its top players to the national tournament, including sophomore Natasha Kingshott and junior Cece Cortes who faced off against one another in the Ramsay Division consolation finals.
“It was definitely tough, but we both played a hard fought match,” Cortes said. “We were really glad that we could represent Harvard in a final match.”
Cortes defeated Kingshott in three games, 11-6, 11-7, and 11-8
This was not Kingshott’s first match against a fellow Crimson player that weekend. She also played teammate and senior June Tiong, beating her, 3-1, while on the path to consolation finals.
“It’s very exciting to see teammates playing in the finals of anything,” Mashruwala said. “It makes you feel proud because your teammates have gotten so far and worked hard all season. I think it was a very good match and I think both [Cortes and Kingshott] played extremely well today.”
Though Harvard dominated Yale last year, with the women’s team defeating the Bulldogs to win the Ivy League championship and both the men’s and women’s individual champions donning crimson uniforms, it seems now as though the tables have turned.
Not only is the new individual champion, Tomlinson, a member of the Yale team, but the Bulldog’s also earned the men’s and women’s Ivy League Championship titles earlier this year.
“[Yale] had a lot of strong players, clearly, as one of their players won individuals this year,” Mumanachit said. “But [Harvard] played really well and gave it their all and really showed the other schools that we’re tough out there.”
This tournament marked the last matches for Mashruwala and Tiong.
“My team has been unbelievable,” Mashruwala said. “They’ve been like my best friends here and leaving is just going to be very hard for me, but I’m very excited, and we had four really, really good seasons.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s squash team (9-6, 3-3 Ivy) sent seven players to Dartmouth this weekend for the CSA individual championships. Contrary to the Crimson’s high expectations, it found most of its victories in consolation play.
“It’s been a disappointing weekend,” senior Richard Hill said. “But we had a lot of good quality squash and we all played 110 percent.”
In the Pool or “A” Division, rookie Gary Power ended the weekend with a loss in the second-round consolation final to Princeton’s Kelly Shannon. Power had been seeded fifth.
Power won in the first round against the Tigers’ Peter Sopher, 11-7, 11-8, 11-7. But 13th-seeded Christopher Binnie from Trinity then pulled off an upset in the following round.
“[It was a] tough loss in the second round,” sophomore Alexander Ma said. “But he came back to finish 10th, which is a great finish for a freshman.”
It was in second-round consolation play that Power began his comeback. He dropped the first game to 12th-seed Thomas Spettigue from Cornell but then rallied to win the next three, 11-4, 11-0, 11-1. Power went on to face Rochester’s Andres Duany, who took the first two games, 11-7, 11-6.
But Power rose to the pressure and came back to pull out victories in the next three games. His stride broke in the next round when he faced Shannon in the consolation final. Although Power pushed him to five by winning the second and third games, Shannon still came out with the win, 11-1, 11-8, 11-6, 11-5, 11-6.
“I think that [Power] played well in his last match, but you had to give his opponent some credit,” Hill said. “In the end, [Shannon] just had it…but [Power] gave him a tough fight.”
The other three competitors in the Pool Division all ended up in the first-round consolation bracket, as none of them found first-round victories.
“It’s disappointing to lose in the early rounds,” said Ma, who competed in the Molloy or “B” Division. “But you still have to go out there and play hard for your team and for Harvard.”
Freshman Brandon McLaughlin lost to eighth-seeded Gabriel De Melo from Franklin & Marshall in the first round. He then rebounded in the first-round consolation bracket, snatching the win from Dartmouth’s Nicholas Sisodia despite losing the third set, 12-10, 11-7, 11-7, 11-7. But McLaughlin was knocked out in the next round by Trinity’s Antonio Diaz Glez.
Captain Reed Endresen, meanwhile, fell to Kenneth Chan from Yale in the first round of the main bracket. He the faced F&M’s Guilherme De Melo, who defeated him in five. Hill was dropped down to consolation play by Andres Vargas from Trinity, and he was finished off by Dartmouth’s Christopher Hanson in consolation play.
“I think overall it was a disappointing weekend,” Hill said. “We came in with very high expectations, but that being said, the freshman class has a lot of potential.”
Rookie Nigel Koh was the only one to make it to past the second round in either division, reaching the semifinals of the Molloy Division.
All three Crimson representatives in the Molloy league received byes in first-round play and went straight to the second round.
Koh started his winning streak, knocking out Wesleyan’s John Steele in second-round play and going on to face Brad Thomson from Brown. He dropped the first game, 11-4, but then rallied to win the next three, 13-11, 14-12, 11-9. Next, Koh won a spot in the semifinals against sophomore teammate Zeke Scherl, winning 11-3, 11-6, 13-11. But Koh’s streak was ended by George Washington University’s Omar Sobhy, who defeated him in four games. Sohby then went on to win the Molloy Division against Matt Domenick from Rochester.
Scherl took down Colby’s Harry Smith in the second round in an exciting five-game victory. He won the first game, 11-6, then dropped the next two, 11-5, 15-13. Scherl finally rallied to take the match with two consecutive victories, 11-7, 11-6. In the third round, he beat the Big Green’s Robert Maycock in four but was then beat out by his teammate Koh for a spot in the semifinals.
Meanwhile, Ma made it to the second-round consolation semi-finals. After losing in the main bracket to Trinity’s Juan Flores, he rediscovered his stride and took down Connecticut’s Caleb Garza. Next, Ma knocked out Blake Reinson from Brown, pulling out a victory in four games. But Cornell’s Rishi Jalan terminated Ma’s run in the tournament, dropping the sophomore in four matches.
“There were some good performances all around,” Ma said. “It showed that our team has a lot of heart and a lot of grit.”
As the final squash tournament of the year it was an emotional weekend for the seniors as well.
“It was my senior year, so it was good to see the guys do an awesome job this weekend,” Endresen said.
“This weekend was my last weekend of squash.” Hill added, “It’s been a great four years, and just looking at the sophomores and younger players, it looks like a very bright future.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It may not have been the campus attraction that was the Harvard-Princeton basketball game, but the Ivy League title was still on the line for the men’s swimming and diving team this past weekend. Ultimately the squad was unable to add another championship to the Crimson’s total.
Harvard (9-0) hosted the other seven Ivy competitors for the Ivy League Championships this past Thursday through Saturday at Blodgett Pool and managed to finish in second place with 1,394.5 points, just 5.5 behind the champion Tigers’ 1400.
“We were coming into the meet with a lot of momentum after HYP,” junior Rob Newell said. “I do think we were the underdogs coming into it and that Princeton was favored...It’s tough to lose by such a close margin, but we were a lot closer to Princeton than we had been in the past.”
From the first day of competition, it had been clear that the title would come down to Harvard and Princeton—whom the hosts had already beaten earlier this season.
The team of senior Will Heyburn, junior Nicholas Tan, and freshmen Oliver Lee and Chris Satterthwaite got things started off for the Crimson by nabbing third place in the 200-yard freestyle relay, finishing in 4:24.98.
Freshmen Wes Stearns and Spenser Goodman earned Harvard even more team points with second- and fourth-place finishes in the 500-yard freestyle, respectively.
Lee picked up another second place finish for his squad in the 50-meter freestyle with a time of 20.13, just missing first place for the event.
In the 400-yard medley, the Crimson finished up the first day of the competition in fourth place in the event, 13 points behind the Tigers.
“I think those first days are our weakest days,” Newell said. “We didn’t let it get us down too much.”
On the second day of the meet, Harvard slipped even further behind the Tigers. After two days of events, the Crimson stood at 916 team points, while Princeton led the meet with 950 points.
Co-captain Justin Davidson, Tan, and freshmen Lee and Jack Pretto teamed up to begin the evening session with fourth place in the 200-yard medley. Pretto followed up the solid medley finish by taking third in the 100-yard backstroke, posting a time of 49.03 seconds.
In the 1,650-yard freestyle, Stearns won his heat but finished second overall with a time of 15:18.62.
The Crimson ended the day with another second-place result in the 800-yard freestyle relay, as sophomore Gregory Roop and freshmen Danny Crigler, Goodman, and Satterthwaite finished in 6:34.95.
Harvard went into the third day down by 34 points, but key victories moved the Crimson within striking distance of Princeton.
Junior Rob Newell pushed Harvard closer in terms of team points to the Tigers by placing third in the 200-yard backstroke.
Satterthwaite followed that up by earning second place in the 100-yard freestyle in 44.76 seconds. Lee finished just behind in fifth place with 44.97 seconds, and Heyburn placed sixth with a time of 45.20 seconds.
Sophomore Michael Stanton claimed the one-meter diving competition with a score of 327.27, beating out Princeton’s Stephen Vines, the second-place winner in the event.
The Crimson was down by as much as 81 points during the third day, but the squad managed to pull within 7.5 points of Princeton before the day’s final race.
In the 400-yard freestyle relay, the quartet of Crigler, Heyburn, Lee, and Satterthwaite beat out Princeton’s representatives but could not earn first place in the event, and dooming the hosts to a 5.5 point loss.
“It just goes to show a lot of good things can happen if you don’t get down on yourself,” Newell said. “I think we fought it through to the very end when we could have given up.”
After the meet, senior Zac Ranta was awarded the Ron Keenhold Award for being the career high-point diver at the Ivy League Championships.
“It was really an honor to win the award and it was a testament to all four years of hard work,” Ranta said. “It was a great way to cap off my career on the Harvard swimming and diving team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s been a seesaw season for the Harvard men’s tennis team and this weekend proved to be no different.
The Crimson went on its first road trip of the spring season this weekend and added a tally in both the win and loss columns against its two opponents. Harvard (6-6) secured a 5-2 win over Ball State (8-4) on Saturday, but the team could not carry the momentum over in its match against Louisville (9-6), where the squad fell, 5-2.
“I think the team did well this weekend,” junior Jon Pearlman said. “We came out pretty solid against Ball State and played great in doubles against Louisville…It’s a good sign for the rest of the season.”
LOUISVILLE 5, HARVARD 2
Harvard lost its sixth match of the duals season against Louisville, dropping the squad to .500 for the year. Despite the loss, the team still displayed a level of play that demonstrated it is still improving against the best teams.
The Crimson started out the matchup by losing the doubles point that has proven to be important for the team’s success this season.
Captain Aba Omodele-Lucien and freshman Casey MacMaster dropped the first doubles match, 8-6, but Pearlman and sophomore Josh Tchan battled back for the Crimson to even the score.
Junior Ali Felton and sophomore Andy Nguyen toughed out the longest doubles match of the day, but it wasn’t enough for Harvard. The duo lost, 9-7, forfeiting the first point to the Cardinals.
“I thought we did very well against Louisville,” said Harvard coach Dave Fish ’72. “The last doubles point was actually very close.”
In the singles, the Crimson managed to secure only two wins, but these two players wrapped up their matches in impressive fashion.
MacMaster was the second Harvard player to finish, downing Dante Terenzio, 6-4, 6-2. Even though Pearlman’s score line was similar, he could not take his opponent down as quickly. Pearlman managed to defeat Austen Child, 6-3, 6-2, but was the second to last Crimson player to finish.
HARVARD 5, BALL STATE 2
The Crimson opened up its first matchup on the road with a crushing victory over Ball State.
Harvard continued to dominate in the doubles portion of the event, as the squad has done throughout most of the season, sweeping all three games. MacMaster and Omodele-Lucien soundly defeated their opponents in an 8-1 rout to win the first doubles match.
Felton and Nguyen have been successful as a duo this season and continued that success against Dalton Albertin and Shaun Bussert, 8-3, to clinch the doubles point for the Crimson. Pearlman and Tchan toughed out an 8-6 win to sweep all three doubles matches for Harvard.
The squad only needed three of the singles matches to edge the Cardinals, but four Harvard players managed to pull out victories over their opponents, three of which were straight-set victories.
Pearlman overpowered his opponent, Cliff Morrison, surrendering only one game. Pearlman took the first set, 6-1, and then bageled his opponent in the second to give the Crimson a 2-0 lead against Ball State.
“In the last couple of weeks, I’ve really upped my training regimen, and as a result, I’ve become a lot quicker on the court,” Pearlman said. “I’m making fewer unforced errors and am able to wear my opponents down.”
Felton and Tchan were the other two Harvard players to finish off their opponents in straight sets. Tchan achieved a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Austin Smith, and Felton won in a similar fashion, 6-3, 6-4.
For MacMaster, it was not as simple, but he prevailed in three sets. He won the first set 6-3, but then his opponent evened things up at one set apiece. MacMaster managed to pull out the victory though with a 10-3 in the super tiebreak to decide the third set. With the win, MacMaster improved to 5-1 for the season.
If the Crimson continues to demonstrate this type of play that it showed this weekend, the squad should be able to tip the seesaw it’s been having in its favor.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Winning the first two games of its match against Princeton (1-11, 0-7 EIVA Tait) last Saturday at the Malkin Athletic Center, the Harvard men’s volleyball team (7-5, 0-3 EIVA Hay) seemed ready to put the Tigers to rest.
But with a huge momentum swing, Princeton clawed its way back to take the next two frames.
Down halfway through the fifth game, 7-3, the Crimson mounted a major comeback, taking the final frame, 15-10, and winning the match, 3-2.
“We got hot, and we were all fired up,” said freshman outside hitter Chris Gibbons of Harvard’s late comeback. “They couldn’t catch us.”
Coming into the match on a four-game losing streak, the Crimson started out with aggressive play, taking advantage of the Tigers’ overpasses and weak middle to build an 18-12 lead.
Gibbons furthered this lead with a streak of five serves, including an ace, that carried Harvard to a nine-point advantage.
The Crimson’s domination of the first frame was sealed with a kill slammed right down the middle of Princeton’s defense from junior outside hitter Matt Jones, winning the opening frame, 25-16.
“We passed well early. We were able to run the middle really well against them,” Jones said.
In the second game, both Harvard and the Tigers started off by taking advantage of the other’s overpasses and missed serves.
With the greatest point-difference in the frame only being four—in Princeton’s favor—the game was defined by constant side-outs from each team.
The Tigers gained the 24-23 advantage and were poised to take the game, when Gibbons slammed a deep cross-court kill that tied the score at 24.
The back-and-forth play continued until Jones produced a kill that gave Harvard the advantage.
The next rally, the freshman team of outside hitter Michael Owen and middle blocker Nick Madden went up for a crushing block that gave the Crimson the win, 29-27.
“The first two games, I really thought we played as well as we had all season,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said. “Our serve-receive and passing [were] much better.”
The third game found Princeton playing with more fire, jumping out to a 10-5 advantage.
Though the hosts recorded 17 kills to the Tiger’s 11, a number of errors from missed passes and serves caused the Crimson to lose its momentum.
Princeton’s freshman outside hitter Jeff Stapleton, who recorded 19 kills over the course of the entire match, provided the spark for the Tigers to top Harvard, 25-22, in the third frame.
“A lot of it was passing and hitting errors,” said Jones of the team’s loss in the third game. “They started blocking a little better, and we didn’t adjust really well.”
The Crimson’s messy play continued into the fourth game, with Harvard recording more errors than kills.
Princeton broke away from the Crimson at 9-9, notching seven unanswered points and 16 kills to Harvard’s six.
The faulty Crimson defense and serve-receive allowed the Tigers to win the game, 25-21, and knot the match, 2-2.
“We really had them there in the first game, and then we started to let up later in the match,” Gibbons said. “With a team like Princeton, you really can’t do that.”
Harvard’s struggles continued at the start of the fifth frame.
The defense was not reading blocks and gave the Tigers the opportunity to jump ahead, 7-3.
The turning point of the match came when the Crimson changed its play at the net.
Strong blocking from freshman middle blocker Kyle Rehkemper and another down-the-line kill from Gibbons sparked a rally, and Harvard grabbed its first advantage at 9-8.
The Crimson did not look back, completing a 12-3 run that won the game, 15-10, and clinched a 3-2 victory. The win snapped a four-game losing streak.
“When we got down in the third and fourth games, [coach Baise] just came out and told us it’s whoever wants it more,” Gibbons said. “We weren’t going to lose this match, and that’s what made the difference.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Friday night the Harvard men’s volleyball team (7-5, 0-3 EIVA Hay) set out to snap its three-game losing streak and get the weekend off to a good start against Juniata (12-9, 5-0) at the Malkin Athletic Center.
The two teams played four close games, with the Crimson winning the first but coming up just short in the next three.
“I think we played with a lot of passion tonight,” said freshman outside hitter Chris Gibbons. “But what we’ve been struggling on in the past is that we’re just not closing the games, and so we just make a few more mistakes than the other team—we can’t make mistakes and still win matches.”
The first game started slowly, with four back-to-back missed serves, two from each team. Gibbons scored the first earned point for the Crimson with a powerful hit off the Juniata block.
The Eagles responded with a side-out, only to waste their possession with a serve into the net.
The squads reached a tie at six, but a block by freshman Nick Madden and a serving rally by fellow rookie Kyle Rehkemper propelled Harvard to a 10-7 lead.
After junior co-captain Matt Jones took advantage of an accidental overpass by Juniata, the Eagles called time-out at 13-8 to shift the momentum.
Harvard miscues and hustle by Juniata cut the margin to two points, but the Crimson utilized its offense—attacking at .500 as a team—to arrive at a 25-22 victory in game one.
“The first game was our best offensive game of the season,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said. “But for whatever reason, we couldn’t sustain it.”
The Eagles started the second game with the serve but didn’t keep it for long, after a huge hit by outside hitter Jones.
Then a pair of missed serves by Juniata gave Harvard the opportunity to extend its lead to 7-3.
These missed serves by both teams reflected a common trend in the match as a whole: the Crimson and the Eagles missed 17 and 20 serves, respectively.
The teams fought back and forth for points, tying things up at 18.
But Juniata took its first lead of the game on an error by Harvard and extended its advantage with a block.
With the score set at 20-18, the Crimson called a time-out to quell the Eagles’ energy. Following the respite, Harvard managed great defense—including big pickups off the block—but Juniata maintained the lead for the remainder of the game, finishing at 25-23.
Game three was another nail-biter.
The home team displayed its cohesion with an ability to score even out of system. Sophomore setter Rob Lothman made a crucial dig, allowing Gibbons the opportunity to feed Jones for a kill early on.
Each team constantly struggled for points, exchanging leads until another tie at 17-17, when the Eagles snatched the advantage away from Harvard. Again, the Crimson called a time-out hoping for a turnaround down 20-17.
Harvard exited the time-out with an aggressive charge, including clutch kills by Gibbons and Rehkemper, which brought the home team within a point at 22-21.
Yet Juniata found harmony between its offense and defense to close the game, 25-22.
The Crimson came into game four fighting for its life.
Early on, plays like the pass, set, kill combination by junior co-captain and libero Dan Schreff, Lothman, and Jones set the tone for the set.
Back-to-back aces by Gibbons had the stands rumbling and kept the Harvard momentum rolling.
As the game progressed, though, the Crimson lagged behind and found itself behind, 22-17.
Coming out of the timeout, Harvard made a scoring push, shrinking the Juniata lead to three points, but the Eagles held on to take the game, 25-22, and with it, the match.
“It hurt to lose this one—it felt like it was ours to win,” Baise said. “But we got progressively worse; in the fourth game, we ended up attacking at zero, and you can’t win a volleyball game like that.”
Despite the final result, the Crimson made significant improvements from its first matchup against Juniata, when it lost in three games by a larger margin.
A number of Harvard individuals also performed well, including middle blocker Madden, who hit .533 with eight kills, made no errors, and picked up five digs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the weekend, the Harvard men’s and women’s track and field teams participated in the ECAC meet at the Reggie Center in Boston and in the IC4A championship at Boston University’s Track and Field Pavilion. The Crimson impressed, setting two school records, one in each competition.
“It was great,” Crimson Coach Jason Saretsky said. “I saw two school championships at two different meets, within twenty minutes of each other.”
The two school-record setters were senior middle-distance runner Hilary May, who broke the 1000-meter run record with a time of 2:49.07, and senior middle-distance runner Brian Hill, who set a new time in the 800 meter.
Overall, the woman’s team, led by May’s performance, took third at the ECAC Championships. May took first in the 1000-meter run with a record-setting mark of 1:49.65.
“It feels really amazing…to leave a mark,” May said. “I’ve had my eyes on that record since I’ve been a sophomore, so it’s great to get it in my last indoor race.”
Senior distance-runner Claire Richardson also made her presence known by taking second place in the 3000-meter run with a time of 9:27.83. Harvard distance runners continued to dominate, with junior distance-runner Kailyn Kuzmuk’s seventh-place finish in the 1600-meter run with a time of 4:53.44.
The relay teams also made a strong statement by taking fourth in the 4X400 with a time of 3:44.81 and third in the 4X800 with a time of 8:53.13.
“The relays are something we take a lot of pride in; it’s a great example of our depth,” Saretsky said. “It’s something that our student-athletes rally around. They get excited about being able to compete for their teammates.”
The day’s success on the track was completed by freshman sprinter Meisha Brook’s third-place finish in the 400 with a time of 56.06.
Despite having only two jumpers qualify for the ECAC championships, the women still had a strong showing in the field events. On Saturday, sophomore Olivia Weeks came in seventh in the long jump with a mark of 18’7” and went on to place 22nd in the triple jump the following day with a mark of 37’8”. Meanwhile, fellow sophomore Mary Hirst took 17th in the high jump on Saturday with a jump of 5’5”.
“Overall, it was a really great weekend,” May said. “[We were] coming off the Ivy League championships last weekend, and it feels good to keep the momentum going.”
“On the women’s side, it’s by far the most competitive we’ve ever been at this meet,” Saretsky said. “[It’s] by far the most points we’ve ever scored at this meet, and it’s the highest finish we’ve ever got.”
Meanwhile the men placed 45th at the IC4A championships at Boston University’s Track and Field Pavilion. Although the Crimson men were missing their throwers—coach Catherine Grace Erickson’s chose to rest her squad for the outdoor season rather than have the throwers compete in the meet—the Harvard men nonetheless showcased some strong individual performances.
Following Hill’s record-setting performance on Saturday in the preliminaries for the 800 meter, he would take ninth in the finals with a time of 1:53.43.
“It feels great [to get that record],” Hill said. “I’m happy to have made my mark on the board. It’s a good way to see where you are as we move forward into the outdoor season.”
“It was great to see him get that feather in his cap,” Saretsky said.
The Harvard men’s relay team also put points on the board by taking sixth in the 4X800 with a time of 7:36.39, while sophomore pole vaulter Fedor Garin rounded out the Crimson’s showing with a ninth-place finish (15’7’’) in the pole vault.
“[It was] just a great way to end our indoor season,” Saretsky said. “It gives us some great momentum heading into the outdoor season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It wasn’t talent that doomed the Harvard men’s lacrosse team Saturday afternoon. It was Pride.
In its first road game of the 2011 season, the Crimson (1-1) was unable to overcome a tough opponent, suffering a 15-9 defeat to No. 5 Hofstra (4-0) in Hempstead, N.Y.
The Pride won despite being outshot 49-31 by the Crimson, whose high-powered offensive attack was not enough to overcome the stellar goaltending of Hofstra’s Andrew Gvozden, who made 15 saves.
“I think the magnitude of the game itself presented us with a challenge that we haven’t seen so far this year,” freshman John Rose said. “We did a good job preparing the week before, but I think preparing against a team is definitely different than playing against the real thing.”
After Hofstra midfielder Brad Lozieaux started out the scoring by beating sophomore goaltender Harry Krieger 2:57 into the first quarter, Crimson sophomore Jack Doyle responded by firing one past Gvozden just 30 seconds later to tie things up at 1-1.
Pride senior attackman Jamie Lincoln scored the first of his five goals to put Hofstra back up, but junior co-captain Kevin Vaughan and classmate Jeff Cohen each tallied a score to put Harvard ahead, 3-2, with 7:41 remaining in the first period.
“[Kevin] pretty much starts our offense, gets it going” sophomore Peter Schwartz said. “He’s the Energizer bunny out there; there’s really nothing he can’t do on the field.”
The Pride, though, would go on to end the frame with three unanswered goals, the final two being scored by Lincoln in a 12-second span.
“[Lincoln’s] a very unorthodox type of lacrosse player,” Rose said. “He worked well with his other attack, [senior] Jay Card, and that presented us with a duo that was hard to defend.”
After Harvard sophomore midfielder Alex White scored just 48 seconds into the second period to bring Harvard back within one, Hofstra responded by tallying four straight to open up a 9-4 advantage. Card had the first two of those goals, midfielder Kevin Ford followed with one of his own, and Lincoln fired home his fourth to put the Pride in control.
“[Lincoln and Card] had their little tricks, their little picks and pops and what not that they used all game,” Rose said. “If one wasn’t working, the other one was.”
After Card was whistled for a two-minute illegal body check penalty, Cohen responded with a man-up goal, his second score of the contest. Classmate Terry White then fired one past Gvozden with 1:06 remaining in the period to bring the Crimson within 9-6 heading into halftime. Despite its deficit, Harvard not only outshot the home team but also earned more ground balls and won more faceoffs than the Pride in the first half.
“I think we rushed a couple of shots [and] forced some things,” Schwartz explained.
Hofstra came out firing in the third quarter, widening its advantage with goals by midfielder Ian Braddish and attackman Torin Varn. Card earned his third assist of the contest on Braddish’s score, while Varn’s goal was the rookie’s first of his career.
After co-captain Dean Gibbons beat Gvozden to bring Harvard within 11-7, the Pride again responded with three unanswered scores to pull away. Attackman Mike DeNapoli had a man-up goal after Crimson freshman Ryan Alden was whistled for pushing, and Braddish and Card added their second and third scores of the afternoon, respectively.
Junior Terry White again added the final goal of a period for the Crimson, beating Gvozden with 1:38 remaining to make the score 14-8 in favor of the Pride heading into the final period.
The fourth quarter saw considerably less scoring than the other frames, which featured eight, seven, and seven goals, respectively. After Lincoln added his fifth score of the contest by beating Krieger with 10:56 remaining, the Crimson was unable to muster a comeback, with its only point coming from Vaughan with 4:37 left in the game.
“We kind of over thought it a little bit too much,” Rose said. “I think our team was so focused on winning the game at all costs that I think we forgot to do the little things…we lost site of the game as whole.”
Harvard fell despite having only 11 turnovers to Hofstra’s 18, as well as earning six man-up advantages to the Pride’s three.
The teams each won 14 of 28 faceoffs, 12 of which were achieved by Crimson senior Andrew Parchman. Hofstra had the advantage in groundballs, 39-34, with senior Matt Hull leading Harvard with six.
Cohen, Terry White, and Vaughan each had two goals for the Crimson, which faces a quick turnaround with its next game coming Tuesday afternoon at home against Georgetown.
“We just need to focus in on getting back to mechanics, shooting overhand, shooting high-low,” Schwartz said. “We’ll be fine; we just need to settle down on offense.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Forced to take the hard road to an Ivy League title after losing to Yale by one point in New Haven two weekends ago, the Harvard men’s basketball team (22-5, 11-2 Ivy) began its final homestand of the season Friday evening with a balanced display of perimeter scoring and defense.
Led by sophomore guard Brandyn Curry’s career-high 14 assists and freshman guard Laurent Rivard’s game-high 21 points, the Crimson cruised to a 79-64 win against Penn (12-14, 6-6).
Curry also had a game-high four steals to go along with his first career double-double.
“Brandyn was obviously the catalyst,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “When he’s aggressive and making plays for our team, we’re a dangerous team.”
Having turned in an all-around performance the last time the Crimson played the Quakers, Curry jumpstarted the team early in the game by finding open teammates on the attack and smothering opposing point guard Zack Rosen on the other end of the floor.
Despite being unable to snatch a lead the entire game, the Quakers were never far behind through the first seven minutes of the contest. After senior forward Jack Eggleston hit a three-pointer, the visitors were down by just two, 13-11.
But Penn failed to capitalize on a Curry turnover on Harvard’s next possession, as Harvard recovered the ball after an offensive foul by Eggleston. Curry was then able to find teammate Matt Brown for a three-pointer.
From then on, the Crimson never looked back. Rivard scored the next eight points in the game with consecutive three-pointers and a pair of free throws to give Harvard a 13-point lead.
“That’s the kind of player Rivard is,” Amaker said. “When he’s shooting the ball well and giving us some points off the bench, it certainly gives us a shot in the arm.”
Feeding off of the raucous crowd’s energy after Rivard’s impressive shooting display, guard Oliver McNally and forward Kyle Casey served up the highlight of the night.
From behind the three-point line, McNally threw an alley-oop pass to a cutting Casey, who rose above all and slammed the ball in with his right hand.
“I was a little late,” McNally said. “So I had to throw it on a line instead of lobbing it like usual. But Kyle made the crazy play...it was a big-time dunk.”
In addition to the Crimson’s stellar offensive exhibition, the team also played suffocating defense, forcing 11 turnovers in the first period, which Harvard turned into 21 of its 47 first-half points.
Amaker credited his squad’s defensive efficiency to an improved approach in containing Rosen.
“Rosen was tremendous with the ball [last time],” Amaker said. “I thought we did a much better job of having the team awareness to help on his penetration and help on ball screen coverage.”
After shooting 65 percent from the field, the Crimson headed into halftime with a commanding 22-point lead. But the team remembered the squads’ meeting one month ago, when Penn rallied from 18-down with 15 minutes left in the game to force a double-overtime thriller.
“I heard our kids talking about it at the half,” Amaker said, “which is a really good sign of them thinking the right way to maintain focus for the second half.”
That kind of mental preparedness helped Harvard hold its ground when Penn opened the second half with a 6-0 run.
Curry steadied the ship with a jumper from the top of the key. From there, McNally, Rivard, and sophomore guard Christian Webster hit timely jumpers to help increase the lead to 26 points with 14 minutes left to play in the game. Webster scored 10 of his 14 points in the second half.
Penn would eventually cut into the Crimson’s large lead and close the gap to 15, but the visitors were unable to mount a serious comeback like they did a month ago.
“Penn has stayed hungry and played well when they’ve been down,” Amaker said. “So we knew that just because we were up by a decent margin at the half, that wasn’t going to be the end of the game. We knew we had to play 40 minutes to win this game, and certainly we did that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After losing its first two games of the season by a wide margin on Friday, the Harvard men’s baseball team fought back on Sunday but fell to Jacksonville State in two nail-biting losses.
The Crimson (0-4) played two double-headers against the Gamecocks (7-3) at Rudy Abbott Field in Jacksonville, Ala., with Harvard hoping to start the season off on a strong note.
“We wanted to gain some momentum to boost our confidence going into next week for Spring Break when we are playing every day,” captain Tyler Albright said. “We did some things right, and we did some things wrong. Now we know what we need to work on. It’s real tough coming home after losing four games, but we have some time in the bubble to practice this week before we go into Spring Break.”
JACKSONVILLE STATE 5, HARVARD 4
A late rally in the sixth inning fell short as the Crimson lost the last game of the series against Jacksonville State.
In the top of the sixth down 5-2, Harvard made a charge. The inning started with Albright being hit by a pitch, followed up by a triple to center field from junior Marcus Way, which brought Albright home.
Junior Jeff Reynolds had an RBI single to bring the Crimson back within one, putting the tying run on first and no outs.
But Harvard could not score another run after freshman Jake McGuiggan grounded into a double play to end the frame.
Junior Todd Hornsby ended up shutting down the Crimson in the seventh and final inning to pick up his third save of the series, and the Gamecocks swept the weekend, four games to none.
JACKSONVILLE STATE 5, HARVARD 4
Harvard dropped the first game of Sunday’s double-header in a close 5-4 loss. From the start of the game, neither side was able to pull away.
The Crimson scored two runs in the third, with McGuiggan crossing home on a wild pitch, and O’Neill following right after on a RBI groundout from senior Sam Franklin. But Jacksonville State responded in the bottom of the frame with a two-run double from first baseman Erik Underwood.
With the score tied at four apiece entering the bottom of the eighth, senior Blake Seguin tripled to put the winning run for the Gamecocks 90-feet away with only one out, and a Bishop sac-fly put the home team ahead for good.
Hornsby came into close the game and ended up striking out the side to ensure victory for Jacksonville State.
Freshman Bradley Raulston earned the win, while junior Will Keuper got the loss despite only giving up one run in three innings.
JACKSONVILLE STATE 8, HARVARD 4
Harvard came out strong to start the second game by tallying three runs in the first but ended up falling to the Gamecocks, 8-4, in the second game on Friday.
Albright and sophomore Danny Moskovits started the two-out rally in the first with consecutive singles. Reynolds followed with a walk to load the bases. In the ensuing at-bat, Way walked and pushed Albright home. Right fielder Andrew Hatch continued the rally by singling in Moskovits and Reynolds.
The Crimson tallied another run in the third on a Hatch single, making the score 4-1 Harvard. Hatch had four hits and three RBIs in the game.
Jacksonville State came back in the bottom of the third inning, scoring two runs on RBI singles from junior Sam Eberle and senior Matt McLaughlin.
Franklin limited the damage by throwing out Eberle at the plate on the McLaughlin single, keeping the score in Harvard’s favor, 4-3.
The home team tied the game in the fifth on a double from freshman Coty Blanchard and took the lead for good on a fielder’s choice.
Blanchard and Segiun led the Gamecocks to victory, with Blanchard recording four hits and Seguin tallying three runs. Jacksonville State’s strong relief pitching held the Crimson scoreless over the final six innings, sealing the deal for the home team.
JACKSONVILLE STATE 6, HARVARD 1
In the first game of the series, Harvard succumbed to the solid pitching performance of senior Jordan Beistine and junior Tanner Freshour. The duo combined to give up only one unearned run and three hits.
Blanchard led the charge for the Gamecocks’ offense, scoring four runs on two hits, including a solo home run.
The Crimson only plated one run, with Moskovits scoring on a McGuiggan sacrifice fly. But Harvard could not capitalize on the rest of its chances, stranding 10 runners on base.
“There were a bunch of excuses as to why we didn’t do well,” junior Brent Suter said. “But it came down to them executing a little better and getting those extra runs. We struggled, but we still think we are fine in terms of the season. It was the first weekend. By the time we get an Ivy [game], we feel we [will] make those adjustments and eliminate those mistakes and come out on top.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Any concern that Harvard men’s basketball would overlook Penn in anticipation of league-leader Princeton was wiped away in the first 20 minutes of Friday night’s game at Lavietes Pavilion.
In its best first half of the season, the Crimson jumped out to a 13-point lead in the first 10 minutes and increased the margin up to 22 points by halftime.
“I thought we played a tremendous first 20 minutes,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I thought our defense was outstanding, [and] I thought we had great energy.”
Coming off its second league loss of the season, the Crimson’s conference title hopes depended on a win over the Quakers, a fact that was not lost on Harvard.
“A lot of people were saying that we might be looking ahead to Princeton and overlook [Penn],” sophomore guard Brandyn Curry said. “That’s how a lot of teams lose games, so our focus was to come out and get on them early.”
The key to the Crimson’s early success was ball movement.
In the first half, Harvard recorded assists on 14 of its 17 first-half field goals, and it had balanced production between the post and the perimeter.
“We shot the ball well, but we were unselfish,” Amaker said. “[We] had great opportunities because of great ball movement.”
The Crimson’s efficiency on offense in the first half was matched by its effectiveness on defense.
Harvard forced 11 turnovers in the first frame while holding the Quakers to 9-of-21 shooting from the field.
The Crimson backcourt largely neutralized Penn’s playmaking guard Zack Rosen, holding him to one-of-five shooting in the first half.
“To guard Zach Rosen can be a nightmare,” Amaker said. “We had to do it as a group, as a team.”
DIALED IN FROM DISTANCE
Harvard was able to generate offense from behind the three-point line all night long.
Off drives and kick outs, the Crimson created a number of open looks from deep, which it was consistently able to knock down.
Freshman forward Laurent Rivard went 4-for-5 on threes in the first half and 5-of-7 on the night.
After a slow start, sophomore guard Christian Webster went 2-of-4 from deep in the second frame.
“Laurent and Webbie, I think, are the two best shooters in the league,” Curry said. “They were just knocking shots down.”
“I would be surprised if there’s a harder worker in the league on his jumper [than Rivard],” junior co-captain Oliver McNally said. “It just showed tonight...When you give Laurent [open] looks, he’s going to knock those down.”
The entire team was seemingly dialed in.
McNally went 2-of-5 from three-point land, and Curry and freshman guard Matt Brown hit one of two attempts.
As a whole, Harvard connected on 47.8 percent of its 23 treys.
CHARITY STRIPE
Free throws are often the difference in close games, so they were a bit of an afterthought in Friday’s blowout.
But both the Crimson and the Quakers put on a virtuosic performance at the charity stripe.
Harvard, the second-best free throw shooting team in the country (trailing only Wisconsin), went to the line 16 times and hit all 16 freebies.
Curry led the way by going 6-of-6, and Rivard’s hot shooting extended to the line where he knocked down four free throws.
Sophomore forward Kyle Casey, McNally, and Webster each chipped in a pair.
Penn, who entered the game shooting 73.4 percent, also was automatic from the stripe.
The Quakers went 19-of-20 from the free throw line on the night.
The work was spread between seven players with Mike Howlett and Jack Eggleston leading the way with four free throws.
Collectively the two teams shot 97.2 percent from the line.
The lone miss for either team came from Fran Dougherty, who bricked a freebie midway through the second half.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The transition from playing indoors to playing outdoors proved to be a non-factor for the Harvard women’s softball team, who went 3-2 in its opening weekend.
“There’s no question the bubble has allowed us to be competitive in the beginning of the season,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “There is definitely a little bit of an adjustment, but I thought the team really made that adjustment quick.”
HARVARD 4, PROVIDENCE 3
On Sunday, the Crimson beat Providence in a close 4-3 matchup. Harvard came out ready to play, beginning with co-captain Ellen Macadam, who slammed an out-of-the-park home run at the first at-bat. Sophomore Ashley Heritage followed the hitting trend, putting herself in scoring position. A few plays later, sophomore Stephanie Regan flied out to right field, but her hit allowed Heritage to score, giving the Crimson an early 2-0 lead. In the third, an error from the Friars put Heritage on base again. This time freshman Kasey Lange earned the RBI with a double-base hit to right-center field, putting Harvard ahead, 3-0. Providence was relentless though, and the Friars scored three runs in the fifth inning to tie the game. The game came down to the seventh inning, when Heritage got on base again after being hit by a pitch. The next batter up, junior Whitney Shaw, hit a single to allow Heritage to score. With help from solid pitching by junior Rachel Brown, the Crimson was able get three straight outs from the Friars to seal the win.
STONY BROOK 4, HARVARD 0
Saturday brought both a big win and a disappointing loss for Harvard, the latter coming at the hands of Stony Brook. The Seawolves got on the board first in the opening inning, a product of four walks, the last one resulting in a free trip to home plate. Two innings later, Stony Brook junior Bernadette Tenuto gave her team to a 3-0 lead after she hit a two-run homerun to left field with her teammate, Shannon O’Shea, on base. Tenuto scored again in the bottom of the fifth inning off of a Crimson error, bringing her team’s lead to 4-0. Harvard tried to make a comeback, but it was unable to get a run. Macadam led the team with two hits out of three at-bats, followed by Regan and Shaw, who each also tallied a hit.
HARVARD 7, MICHIGAN STATE 2
Earlier on Saturday, well-rounded play helped the Crimson battle off Michigan State, tallying a 7-2 win.
“We came out and attacked [Michigan],” Shaw said. “Pitching did a really great job, and defensively we played very strong and solid.”
Lange recorded an RBI when her single allowed Macadam, who originally got on base from her own double, to score. The scoring stayed quiet until the third inning when both teams had a small offensive streak. In the top of the third, the Spartans’ strong hitting led to two earned runs. Brown stopped Michigan from scoring again by striking out the last batter of the frame.
Later in the inning, with co-captain Emily Henderson on base after hitting an infield single, Shaw slammed a line-drive home run down the left-field line, taking away the Spartans’ only lead of the game. Freshman Allison Scott led off the bottom of the sixth inning with a single-run homer. Macadam followed suit, hitting a home run to left-center field. Her home run ran in freshman Shelbi Olson as well, giving Macadam an extra RBI. Before the inning was out, Henderson scored off of an RBI from Lange. Harvard’s sixth-inning power hitting was more than enough to finish off the game on top, 7-2.
FLORIDA ATLANTIC 4, HARVARD 1
The Owls had the lead the entire game, starting with two decisive runs in the first inning. The Crimson tried to come back in the third inning when Lange batted Macadam in for a score, but Florida Atlantic expanded its lead in the fourth inning with a home run from junior Carly Speerin. The last run of the day was also scored by the Owls in the sixth inning. Macadam led the Crimson in hits, batting 3-for-4, while junior teammates Shaw and Jane Alexander both had two hits.
HARVARD 2 SETON HALL 0
Harvard opened up its season with a 2-0 win against Seton Hall on Friday. The game was scoreless until the fourth inning, due to a strong pitching performance by Brown, who allowed only two hits in the seven innings that she pitched. Henderson reached home plate first through an error from the Pirates’ second baseman, putting Harvard ahead 1-0. In the sixth inning, Lange earned an RBI with a double down the right-field line, allowing Henderson to score once again.
Overall, despite the two losses, the Crimson softball team is hopeful for the future.
“We had moments of greatness where we showed our capabilities and our potential,” Shaw said. “We created high expectations for ourselves after this weekend…It’s exciting because we know what we’re capable of.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the Harvard men’s basketball team’s 79-67 win over Princeton Saturday, the Crimson earned itself at least a share of the Ivy League title. But as soon as tomorrow evening, Harvard could find itself in sole possession of the Ancient Eight crown.
While the Crimson (23-5, 12-2 Ivy) concluded its regular season with Saturday’s victory, the Tigers (23-6, 11-2) still have one game left—a matchup with Penn in Philadelphia tomorrow night.
If Princeton comes away with the win, it will force a one-game playoff to determine the recipient of the Ivy League’s automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.
But a Tigers’ victory is far from a sure bet. The Quakers (13-14, 7-6) boast a 4-2 conference record at home this season, with their only home losses to Harvard and Cornell by one and two points, respectively.
When Penn and Princeton last met at Princeton in February, the Quakers blew a one-point lead with 16 seconds left in overtime, falling 62-59.
That being said, the Tigers enter tomorrow’s matchup with confidence.
“I don’t think the game in the Palestra is going to be easy, but I’d be very surprised if we can’t regroup; I just think we need a passionate effort,” Princeton coach Sydney Johnson said. “I really like this team, and I like how they’ve responded to adversity—and this is plenty of adversity.”
If the Tigers come away with the win, the one-game playoff between Harvard and Princeton will take place this coming Friday or Saturday at a neutral court—likely at Yale’s John J. Lee Amphitheater or Columbia’s Levien Gymnasium.
“We did what we could do,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We recognize that no matter what, we get a piece of [the Ivy League championship], and we’re hopeful that we’ll get a chance to play in the NCAA tournament.”
IT’S CURRY TIME
Trailing by 12 midway through the second half, Princeton made one last push to cut into the Harvard lead.
With 9:23 to go, Tigers’ junior Douglas Davis ignited a 7-0 Princeton run after cutting into the lane and sticking a running floater. Following a three-pointer from senior Dan Mavraides and free throws from Kareem Maddox and Ian Hummer, the Crimson’s lead stood at five with 5:24 to play.
With sophomore Kyle Casey—who finished with a team-high 24 points—on the bench with four fouls, it was his classmate Brandyn Curry who took charge of the Crimson offense.
Guarded by Mavraides at the top of the key, Curry used a screen from junior co-captain Keith Wright and attacked the basket hard. Curry went all the way to the hoop, where he was met by Hummer and forward Will Barrett.  Curry absorbed the contact, getting the layup to fall despite being fouled by Barrett.
Curry nailed the ensuing free throw, putting Harvard up eight.
The sophomore point guard helped extend the Crimson’s lead to double digits on Harvard’s next possession, this time slicing into the lane and finding Wright under the basket for an easy two.
“When Brandyn’s aggressive and attacking, we think good things happen,” Amaker said. “Other guys like Kyle and Keith and these other guys get into a rhythm and flow.”
Curry finished the contest with 10 points and 10 assists—marking his second double-double of the weekend.
“We need pace to our game, and this guy is the catalyst for that,” Amaker said after the contest, pointing at Curry. “I think he was sensational all weekend.”
THE KING
While Curry closed out the contest, it was Casey who led the Crimson offense in the early going.
In 29 minutes of play, the 6’7” forward finished with 24 points—a season high.
“I thought [Casey’s] will was just absolutely outstanding,” Amaker said. “He put us on his back for quite a while out there on that floor offensively, just taking charge and leading the way for us and not allowing us to give in or let down.”
Casey finished 9-of-13 from the field, doing most of his damage off of mid-range jumpers. Casey also had success attacking the basket, getting to the charity stripe seven times.
The sophomore made his impact on the court despite being hampered by foul trouble throughout the night. Casey picked up his fourth foul with 8:34 to go in the contest and was relegated to the bench for the next five minutes of play.
Casey didn’t last long when he returned to the floor, fouling out with 1:35 to go.
But Casey certainly made his presence felt during his time on the court, adding four rebounds, a block, and an assist.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The rich are getting richer. Two of Harvard's stronger teams, men's lightweight crew and women's soccer, will welcome top recruits to campus next fall—a C.R.A.S.H.-B. champion and a Central Florida Player of the Year, respectively.
JONATHAN YOUNG, MEN’S LIGHTWEIGHT CREW
Ladue  High School’s Jonathan Young seems to have made a habit of winning.
This past fall, the Crimson commit raced for a cross country team that won the Missouri state championships. But the title was just the warm-up for Young. He has since earned the coveted C.R.A.S.H.-B. hammer by winning the junior lightweight event in a time of 6:25.4 while representing the St. Louis Rowing Club.
Young won’t be the first star rower to come to Harvard from Missouri. Christine Baugh ’10 was recruited from the Show Me State despite not having rowed in high school. Baugh spent her junior and senior years in the Radcliffe heavyweight first varsity eight and served as team co-captain in the 2009-10 season along with classmate Laura Huppert.
MEG CASSCELLS-HAMBY, WOMEN'S SOCCER
With 31 goals, 16 assists, and a team trip to the state finals, Trinity Prep's Casscells-Hamby earned Central  Florida’s Player of the Year honors. Ranked sixth among her state's soccer stars by topdrawersoccer.com, the forward has also distinguished herself off the field, most notably by helping to establish the “Hearts for Haiti” concert that raises money for relief efforts in the area.
But according to her high school coach, the Crimson will benefit from her team-first attitude.
“Meg could have scored 50 goals [this season], but instead she chose to be a team player,” said high school coach Joe Raymond to the Orlando Sentinel. “She put any personal accolades to the side for the greater good of the team.”
Casscells-Hamby will join a team looking to reassert itself in the competitive Ivy League. The women's soccer team won the Ancient Eight crown in the falls of 2008 and 2009 but fell off the mark in 2010.

As part of our Housing Market series, we'll be posting reviews and rankings for each of Harvard's 12 residential Houses over the next few days. Click here to read more about the series.
On Saturday nights, flocks of freshmen trek down Dewolfe Street, looking for a good time. Nine times out of ten, they end up at Mather, where music reverberates enticingly in the concrete courtyard. Say what you will about ugly architecture and distance from the Yard, Mather has one great thing going for it: parties, and plenty of them. As for the other aspects of Mather, there aren’t as many positive things to say. 
Dining Hall: If you were to describe Mather's dining hall as steamy, soapy, and sexy, you wouldn't be wrong—one night of the year, at least. The popular foam-filled Mather Lather bash takes place in the dining hall each spring. On a regular day, however, Mather's dhall is unremarkable. Its full-length windows look out, fortunately, onto the Charles River and, unfortunately, onto cars speeding along Memorial Drive. The constant stream of students partially makes up for the view of automobiles while you dine. Whether it's breakfast, lunch, dinner, or 3 a.m., students can be found eating, working, and socializing. Of course, they're all Matherites—not many venture to faraway Mather from other Houses. This social isolation means, on the up side, that the peanut butter at brain break rarely runs out.
 
Facilities: The Three Column Gallery, located right at the entrance of the dining hall, is ideal for running into friends in passing or taking in the artwork hanging on the walls while waiting to meet someone for a meal. Other common spaces are less impressive; it's just hard to make concrete feel homey. Thus, spaces like the Junior Common Room and "Big TV Room" could do with more people making use of them.
 
Rooms: The rooms are pretty sweet. All Mather residents are guaranteed a single (for life). Sophomores will most likely enjoy a medium-sized single in a two-floor suite with a truly massive common room. Juniors and seniors living in Mather's 18-story tower don’t get common rooms, but the singles are colossal. Even those with 29 pairs of shoes are at a loss to fill the entire space, which residents report can actually be quite annoying. While the concrete walls are undeniably ugly, they at least keep out the rats and roaches that infest other Houses.
 
House Spirit: Matherites often claim that Mather is the founder of House spirit. After all, the House was the first to release a housing day video (back in 2007). To this day, residents refer to Housing Day as "Mather Day," because, as they see it, the day wouldn't matter much without Mather. However, we can't help but wonder why Mather released such a bad housing day video this year.
The departure of longtime House Masters Sandra F. Naddaff '75 and Leigh G. Haffrey '73 is bound to affect House spirit. Just one year into their tenure as Masters, Christine A. McDonald and Michael D. Rosengarten are still meeting upperclassmen and will now be learning new freshmen's names as well. However, McDonald reported last year that both she and her husband like Mather's architecture, so we're willing to award extra House spirit points to anyone who can see beauty in cement.
 
Location: It's far. Not as far as the Quad, but a close competitor. Luckily, the Mather Express pulls up right next to the gate, and if you choose to walk, you're bound to run into a friend from every House (minus the Quad) during those nine minutes of plodding to Emerson Hall.
 
Quirks: One of Mather's best traits is the underground tunnels that connect the buildings. When it's cold outside (meaning almost all year), you'll appreciate these warm, dry routes from your room to the dining hall and back. Of course, this doesn’t quite make up for the snow and rain that you'll muddle through to get to Mather at all.
 
Rating: Because of its distance from the Yard, concrete walls, and too-empty facilities, Mather House is ranked tenth out of 12.
Our rankings so far:
10. Mather
11. Winthrop
12. Cabot

As part of our Housing Market series, we'll be posting  reviews and  rankings for each of Harvard's 12 residential Houses over  the next few  days. Click here to read more about the series.
Right along the bank of the Charles River, one of Harvard's most beautiful Houses (on the outside, that is) proudly sits for all to see. No, we're not talking about Eliot. We're talking about Dunster, the former home of Al Gore '69, Tommy Lee Jones '69, Norman K. Mailer '43, and Deval L. Patrick '78. With its striking red tower, excellent dining hall, and, yes, walk-through rooms, Dunster boasts one of the strongest house communities on campus.
Dining Hall: The food, which is as good as mass-produced cafeteria food gets, is consistently the best on campus, and the hall itself is, in a word, stunning. During the holiday season, the enormous Christmas tree (only slightly smaller than the one in Rockefeller Center) is enough to make you wax nostalgic for home, and on any given day, the napkin holders with moose cutouts on either side are delightful. As if grand dark wood paneling and chandeliers weren't enough, the dining halls stays open late for athletes returning from practice and has brain break available all night. The juice machine is turned off on weekends, however. Tsk tsk.
Facilities: Dunster has the following facilities: a television room, a pottery studio, three music rooms, a Junior Common Room, a small dining room, a weight room, a cardio room, an erg room, two laundry rooms, a half volleyball court, a basketball court, and an amazing library with secret rooms and a carpet donated by Al Gore '69, who lived in Dunster House with his roommate Tommy Lee Jones '69. (Well, the library's only amazing when the books aren't chained to the walls, but who reads these days anyway?) Additionally, Dunster has a grille, which is open nightly until 1 a.m. and until 2 a.m. on weekends.
Rooms: Walkthroughs abound, and you know you're in trouble when most residents start gushing about "great river views." So face it, the rooms aren't the best. Guaranteed n housing for sophomores and juniors, but n+1 for seniors.  
House Spirit: House spirit is what Dunster does best. Dunster's Happy Hours, held bi-weekly in the Junior Common Room, are so popular that the House has to issue ID stickers to restrict access to any wannabe-Dunsterites that are planning to join in on the fun. There are other events as well. Spring formal—"Beltane"—is held in the courtyard, as is Goat Roast, the annual spring event with a roasted goat, outdoor barbeque, and a giant slip-and-slide.
Location: Far. Okay, it's a nine-minute walk from the Yard, but that's an awfully long time to schlep through the snow or the rain if the weather is anything like it's been this year. The Mather Shuttle is always an option, but there will be moments when the shuttle can't be relied on. Pluses: if you're a runner, the Charles River is right there, and if you can drive, Zipcars for rent are parked right outside the House. Also, Trader Joes is only about 15 minutes away by foot.
Quirks: Goat Roast! The Dunster House Opera! Also, the red tower is beautiful.
Rating: Dunster is clearly a great House, but it's inevitable that a few Houses have to fall into the middle rankings. Because it's just not quite in the top six, Dunster is ranked seventh out of 12.
Our rankings so far:
7. Dunster
8. Leverett
9. Currier
10. Mather
11. Winthrop
12. Cabot

With Housing Day just three days away, a menagerie of House mascots have popped up in classes and dining halls around campus.
So far Flyby has confirmed the presence of a Pfolar bear in Economics 10: "Principles of Economics," a Leverett bunny in Statistics 104: "Introduction to Quantitative Methods for Economics," and an Eliot elephant in United States in the World 23: "Art and Thought in the Cold War." Harvard Medical School Professor and Pforzheimer House Master Nicholas A. Christakis donned a polar bear suit while teaching Sociology 190: "Life and Death in the USA: Medicine and Disease in Social Context."
Be on the lookout for mascots and mayhem as Housing Day draws nearer.

As part of our Housing Market series, we'll be posting reviews and rankings for each of Harvard's 12 residential Houses over the next few days. Click here to read more about the series.
If you're the type of student who enjoys taking a short shuttle ride back from your afternoon activities to your retirement home, then Currier is the House for you. Most residents of Currier House report that they don't mind living in a series of dimly lit concrete towers, because their dining hall allegedly serves the best food on campus. One aspect of Currier House life, however, stands out—most Currierites reside in singles, whether off of hallways or in suites.
Dining Hall: Currierites often report that their dining hall serves HUHDS' tastiest food, but even if this were verifiably true (doesn't all HUHDS food taste the same?), the subterranean dining hall lets in very little natural light. Though the food at mealtimes is known to be some of the best on campus, brain break is often exhausted by 10 p.m. On the positive side, the dining hall staff is very friendly, and the House Master's daughter often swipes your card on your way in—undeniably cute.
Facilities: Being located in the Quad has its perks, and Currier does have plenty of common spaces. Just outside the dining hall, you can find a ping-pong table, pool table, and air hockey table—everything you need for a great post-dinner workout. Other common spaces include the Matthew Strominger Room, Bingham Living Room, the Poker Room, and the Treehouse, all of which can reportedly be reserved by students easily. Currier's biggest and most frequently used common space is the Fishbowl, known to non-Currierites as the Hell of "Heaven and Hell" and to Currierites as a favorite spot for stein clubs and a great place to watch television.
Rooms: Most sophomores live in relatively spacious singles, and many of the mice and cockroaches inhabiting River Houses haven't made the trek to the Quad. As many Currier singles are connected to another by a bathroom, you still sort of have a roommate. Though sophomore housing in Currier is comfortable, Currier's best housing is reserved for upperclassmen. Some of the highlights are the 10-man suite and several solariums, tower-top rooms which come complete with spacious balconies.
House spirit: This one's a mixed bag. Although stein clubs are often well-organized and boast high attendance, the House e-mail list, CurrierWire, sees mostly event spam. As a result, many Currierites report that they've unsubscribed.
Location: One word: Quad. The one redeeming aspect of Currier's location is that the shuttle stop is right outside the main entrance, so you don't have to run far to catch the shuttle. You'll be able to make it to any spot in the Yard in 10 – 15 minutes.
Quirks: Currier's mascot is "Woody the Tree"—one of Harvard's more unusual House mascots. For the more creative among us, Currier also boasts its own dance studio and plays host to figure drawing classes organized by the Office for the Arts.
Committee Rank: Because of its distance from the Yard and drab architecture, Currier is ranked ninth out of 12.
