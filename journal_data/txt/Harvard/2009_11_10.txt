After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Hence the vanity of translation;” Percy Shelley wrote, “it were as wise to cast a violet into a crucible that you might discover the formal principles of its color and odor, as to transfuse from one language into another creations of a poet.” What the poet is communicating here is poetry’s fascination with presentation, its syntax, sound, rhythm—aspects that depend on its language of origin—so that there is an almost absurdly destructive quality to any translation. Though its semantic meaning can hold, translation risks the utter loss of all emotional register. This theoretical problem manifests itself pertinently in the anxiety that a translation is not identical to the original, and therefore inauthentic. It’s a troubling feeling to go to the library or bookstore to pick up a foreign poet, only to find three or four different translations available. Which is the right one?
It was with all of these anxieties and prejudices that I approached Edward Snow’s new translation of Rainer Maria Rilke, the early 20th century poet who wrote in German (though he was born in Prague, at the time under Austro-Hungarian control). Before I evaluate the translation, I must admit that I do not speak a single word of German. Accordingly, I will address the book as a reader for whom it was intended: one who does not know the language and therefore needs another to present Rilke’s poetical universe.
Like many, my introduction to the poet was through Stephen Mitchell’s celebrated 1989 translation of Rilke’s selected works. I know this collection intimately, and I’ve even committed a few of Mitchell’s translations to memory. I’ve also read Robert Bly’s 1981 translation, and David Young’s attempt at Rilke’s “Duino Elegies.”
The first thing to notice about Snow’s volume is how thick it is. Though this is technically another “selected” Rilke, it is far more thorough than Mitchell’s or Bly’s. The sheer amount of translation here is both admirable and convenient; it is the most complete recent collection of Rilke’s works in English. This is the culmination of Snow’s several previously-published translations of Rilke’s individual volumes, revised and collected in this larger book.
While Mitchell’s translations are looser and more creatively liberal, Snow’s have an interest in direct syntactical facsimile; with a more direct approach to the formulation of Rilke’s images. In “Going Blind,” a poem from “New Poems,” Rilke describes observing a woman who is ostensibly doing just that. The poem ends with a paradigmatic Rilke image—in observing her impediments, he suddenly perceives a flash of transcendent elegance. Mitchell writes, “and yet: as though, once it was overcome, / she would be beyond all walking, and would fly.” Snow lowers the poetic register, writing, “and yet: as if, after a crossing over, / she would be done with walking, and would fly.” Mitchell’s hypothetical “as though,” draws the “o” sound through “once,” “overcome,” “would,” “beyond,” and “would,” all words connoting transcendence through the hypothetical. Snow’s most notable change is cooling Mitchell’s wider statement, “she would be beyond all walking,” into “she would be done with walking.” Snow also uses “as if,” instead of “as though,” whose “f” reappears in “fly,” which emphasizes the action within the hypothetical, as opposed to the hypothetical itself. In many ways the difference between the translations of these two lines embody the fundamental difference between Snow and Mitchell’s translations—Mitchell is concerned with the force of the imagination, of the dreamy feeling in Rilke, whereas Snow is concerned with the machinery, the functionality, of the content of his conditionals.
This attitude perhaps provides us with a clearer image of what Rilke is doing intellectually; however this often obscures the emotional force of Rilke’s poems. In the third poem of Rilke’s sonnet sequence, “Sonnets to Orpheus,” he addresses a youth, a “Jüngling,” who presumably has been writing bad love poems. Here is Snow’s translation: “It’s [i]not[/i], youth, when you’re in love, even / if then your voice forces open your mouth; — // learn to forget those songs. They elapse.” Though Snow preserves much of the syntax in Rilke’s original, there seems something diluted about the lines. Somehow the causal relation between the “voice” and the “mouth” is only weakly strung together by the pale “forces.” Compare these lines with the Mitchell: “…Young man, / it is not your loving, even if your mouth / was forced wide open by your own voice—learn // to forget that passionate music. It will end.” Though Mitchell changes the syntax considerably, the line breaks and enjambments are absolutely breathtaking. Where Snow maintains that the voice opens the mouth Mitchell has the mouth open first, then the line break, thereafter the cause is discerned. The Mitchell is exhilarating; we empathize for a moment with the Jüngling, we understand this overwhelming of sentiment, which makes the contraction of “it will end” (a much broader statement then “they end”) that much more moving in potency. It serves to note, additionally, that Mitchell maintains some semblance of rhyme in his translations, as strong as “how” and “Apollo” or as faint as “achieved” and “god.” Nevertheless, these pique our imaginations to the fact that these poems have a deep sonic lyrical quality embedded into them. Snow eschews rhyme, focusing on clarity and accuracy.
Ultimately, the Snow translation is no Mitchell. Mitchell provided us with a Rilke that far surpassed anything that came before it. Snow, although inferior to Mitchell, has nevertheless crafted a body of translations that, had Mitchell not already done so, would have easily become “the” way to read Rilke in English.
In judging various translations, we as readers are put in unique positions of judging, and experiencing, different versions of the same poem. All poets offer truths that are pressing and immediate, and yet often our immediate understanding of poetry happens only when the poem’s aesthetic affects us in a certain way. So, assuming translations maintain a reasonable accuracy, it really is a matter of personal preference which translation you choose. For me, Mitchell did the job. However, I believe Snow has put together a translation that will present the ideas and emotions embedded in Rilke’s poems equally enjoyable to others.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Back in 2007, the disappearance of Party Fund grants for alcoholic beverages made many students think Harvard would never again foot the bill for fun. The current UC, however, has taken steps to change this with the new Student Initiated Programming Fund. Introduced last semester, the SIP Fund will allow upperclassmen of legal drinking age to apply for retroactive grants of $200 for student events—which can be parties—in House common spaces.
But the UC has faced serious opposition from administrators and House Masters. These detractors argue that the SIP Fund’s restrictions will not sufficiently ensure that UC money—which effectively is gathered via the College since it comes through student term-bills—doesn’t go to support underage drinking. It is understandable that administrators are concerned, as there are obviously liability issues whenever alcohol is bought and consumed. Yet the UC has taken care to address these concerns when drafting the protocols for the SIP fund. Though it is conceivable that underage students could possibly acquire alcohol at SIP Fund parties, the College must acknowledge—even if only privately—that some underage drinking will take place no matter what and that SIP’s precautions are as good as can be reasonably expected.
There are many distinctions between the old Party Fund system and the new SIP grants. Whereas money from the Party Fund could be used for private suite parties, SIP Fund events must take place in House common spaces. This makes them easier to monitor and also opens them to all the students in the neighborhood in which the event is taking place. Encouraging students to host social events in already existing common spaces like grilles or JCRs will make the most of the present options while the College looks at how to expand common spaces.
Additionally, hosts of the social events where SIP Fund money is used are required to refrain from drinking themselves. While it is likely that there will be many sober attendees at most parties, it is now guaranteed that there will be at least one. Conceivably, the host will work to ensure that those who drink are of age and that the party does not get out of hand.
Finally, only one third of SIP grants can be spent on beer or wine, reflecting the proportion of students who are of legal drinking age. This encourages hosts to devote money to non-alcoholic drinks and food, which is precisely what the Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services and other health professionals recommend in order to ensure that casual alcohol consumption does not turn into unhealthful binge drinking.
The UC has clearly spent a great deal of time thinking how best to devise a way to provide money to students for social events that both is practical and responds to concerns administrators have expressed in the past. The longer administrators and House Masters continue to slow down the implementation of SIP, the longer students will continue turning to unsupervised parties in their suites while College social life suffers. With several significant precautions in place, it is time for administrators to concede that, though there may always be underage drinking, the SIP program is worthy of their approval.

Last Thursday, a gunman opened fire at Fort Hood Army post in Texas, leaving 13 dead and 30 wounded. Our deepest sympathy goes out for the men and women who have fallen and to their families. The victims will always be remembered as heroes who died courageously while serving their country. This tragedy has deeply saddened us, and we hope that, as details emerge, we will become better equipped to prevent similar incidents going forward.
Maj. Nidal Malik Hassan, the alleged shooter, was to be transferred to Afghanistan on Friday to serve as a psychiatrist for troops stationed there. There is little doubt about the severity of mental stress soldiers face on the battlefield. Moreover, the work of military psychiatrists is invaluable to soldiers’ well-being. In the aftermath of this attack, what comes as a shock, however, is just how understaffed the U.S. Army is with regard to mental-health specialists. Currently, only 408 psychiatrists are serving over 550,000 soldiers. Not only is the Army understaffed, but little attention is paid to the psychiatrists themselves, who can be mentally affected by the trauma described by their patients. While we are hesitant to guess at Hassan’s motives, the case has exposed this real lack of mental-health resources in the military.
Evidence has surfaced that Hassan had been previously troubled by the accounts of war veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Records further indicate that he had been upset about being assigned to Afghanistan, possibly due to his religious beliefs. Still, media and government officials should refrain from jumping to conclusions concerning the role of Maj. Hassan’s religious background in this incident. Some rashly speculated that this was an organized terrorist attack, but such claims have since been disproved. Sen. Joseph Lieberman, for instance, suggested that Hassan had become extremist in his views. Whether this drove his actions, though, is for an investigation to prove.
What is most worrisome is that a very troubled individual could be left to treat soldiers suffering from mental-health issues. Holistically, this reveals a structural problem in the Army’s health services that should be investigated. And while these deficiencies in no way excuse Hassan’s actions, we do hope that his trial will allow for an examination of the system of mental-health offerings in the Army—much like the mass shooting at Virginia Tech in 2007 caused many colleges and universities to reevaluate their mental-health support. The Army must consider the mental and emotional well-being of its soldiers to be just as important as physical well-being.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I was walking through the Moscow subway system when a woman grabbed my arm and said in Russian, “Hide your wallet. The Gypsies are crying.” It was only later that I realized what her cryptic warning meant. In Russia, I was repeatedly warned to avoid Gypsies at all costs because of the risk of becoming a victim of Gypsy hypnosis. This practice, in which Gypsies attempt to hypnotize subway riders and others in Russia so that they give away all their money, is a growing problem in Russia; the tough economic climate and social ostracism of Gypsies have forced this nomadic people to resort to innovative means of survival.
Gypsy hypnosis is fairly rare in the Gypsy community, but it shines light on a growing problem in Europe. Gypsies, also known as the Roma people, are the largest ethnic minority in Europe. Some estimate the total Gypsy population could be as high as 15 million. Despite these large numbers, Gypsies suffer from a racism reminiscent of that suffered by the African-American community during in the first half of the 20th century.
Hate crimes against Gypsies abound in Europe. In Hungary, at least 30 Molotov cocktail attacks have been perpetrated against Gypsy homes over the past year. Last year in Italy, appalling photos were published showing indifferent sunbathers enjoying a day at the beach a few meters away from two drowned Gypsy girls, who lay dead under towels. In Slovakia, police arrested six Gypsy boys, forced them to remove their clothes, and then demanded that they hit and kiss one another.
Even in the U.S., the law seems to be biased against Gypsies. A Gypsy in Maryland recently enlisted the American Civil Liberties Union to fight a law that outlaws fortune-telling. The practice is banned because many consider it fraudulent based on the belief that predicting the future is impossible. The Gypsy involved in the case, however, stated, “It’s not like you choose it. You’re born with it.”
The ACLU is not the only American icon to take up the cause of Gypsies. At a concert earlier this year in Romania, Madonna told the crowd that discrimination of Gypsies should end. The crowd responded to her with boos and jeers. This response shows just how strong the underlying hatred against Gypsies has become.
The problem is perpetuated because Gypsies place such a low value on traditional education. Many Gypsies teach their children the traditional music and dance of the Gypsy people, but literacy is not highly valued. This means that Gypsies cannot respond articulately to the negative stereotypes that are circulated in the media of the countries they inhabit. Because of these unique circumstances, both Europeans and Americans should be sensitive to how they treat the subject of Gypsies.
Recently, I heard a joke that the Quad buildings were built over a Gypsy burial ground. This seems like an amusing thought to many people, but would people react the same way if it said that the Quad was built on a Jewish burial ground? Chances are that the joke would not have been very amusing.
In fact, the histories of Jews and Gypsies in Europe have similarities. Both groups have been persecuted. The Jews were banned from England for 300 years under the Edict of Expulsion in 1290, and the Gypsies were banned from England in the 16th century under the Egyptians Act of 1530. The two groups also have both traditionally lacked a homeland. Some even compare the plight of the Gypsies now to that of those who suffered and died in the Holocaust, half a million of whom were Gypsies. The negative images of the wandering Jew and the occult Gypsy are eerily similar. However, what separates these two groups in modern times is that Jews tend to place a high priority on education and can claim a homeland in Israel, whereas Gypsies remain without either.
Discrimination against Gypsies is an issue that many Westerners either partake in or completely ignore, yet American indifference allows the cycle of discrimination against Gypsies to perpetuate itself in Europe. While Gypsies may not have the education or political clout to take a stand for themselves, the West cannot ignore the blatant racism and violence directed toward what is the largest minority group in Europe.

A couple of key words change everything. Google the phrase “universal health care,” and you get over 30 million results. Google “sacrifice for universal health care,” and you’ll get under 200,000. We are ignoring the “universal” part of universal health care. While emphasizing that reforms would cover everyone, we’re at the same time forgetting that this goal requires similarly extensive sacrifice; as a result, our nation’s health-care debate ignores the central issue frustrating its advancement. Both conservative and liberal camps should realize that the chief problem is one of theory, not policy. Correcting health care should not be construed primarily as a matter of dollars and cents, but seen as a referendum, in essence, on public morality.
As long as the prevailing moral discourse in America maintains its current notions, reforming our system of medical care is impossible.
More specifically, health-care advocates need to abandon ethics that prioritize the self over the common good in order for their efforts to bear fruit. Such privileging of autonomy extends from a series of judgments latent in contemporary common wisdom about morality—first, that each person should be free to pursue his desires so long as he does not harm anyone else; second, that such desires cannot be judged inferior to those of someone else. Taken together, these two judgments mean that health-care reform is incompatible with our national moral ethos. Public option or not, finding some way to extend care to the uninsured requires at least some sacrifice by those who are adequately covered under the current system. On an economic level, reform includes inherently sacrificial effort. Welcome or not, redistribution of our fixed resources to a wider group must inconvenience at least some people. Whether through higher taxes, increased premiums, or longer wait times, Americans will suffer at least marginally to provide medical care for a stranger.
Americans seem willing to make this sacrifice, but just barely. About one half of Americans support health-care reform, even though only roughly one fifth of Americans predict a material gain from such support of a national system. According to a recent CBS poll, only 22 percent of Americans “said the reforms now being considered would help them personally,” while 30 percent even believed that “reforms would hurt them personally.” In the same poll, 53 percent favored “the government offering everyone a government administered health insurance plan that would compete with private health insurance plans,” with similar numbers evident under other reform plans. That three percent margin keeping health care on the table is likely to disappear.
Why? Because society’s moral axioms enervate attempts to convince the public to join this slim majority. Since Americans now shy away from a hierarchy of moral preferences, even those who would maintain their current care based on selfishness cannot be condemned. If forsaking current comforts for others would not be obligatory under our contemporary moral decorum, appeals for medical reform would then lose nearly all their persuasive force. While objectors rightly note that inaction hurts the uninsured, precisely because the currently comfortable might intend no harm, this complaint proves relevant but non-essential. In our modern mindset, sacrifice for the sake of another is obviously an act above and beyond the call of duty. We applaud the person who sacrifices for the stranger dying in the street, but we do not force others to follow suit. To the reform obstructionist who sees universal health care as a type of forced charity, society can say nothing and must even remain silent.
Our reawakened consciousness to the plight of the uninsured is anchored within our moral framework. The intellectual backing necessary for its success, however, is not. The health-care debate serves as only one instance of this more general conflict between compassion and conscience. Our collective moral outlook appears purposefully structured, above all, to not offend and to avoid dogmatic statements that seem improvable. Even disapprobation toward a selfish man seems out of place. His hoarding might not be laudable, but each of us is hesitant to claim definite knowledge of his moral worth. In a widespread effort such as national medical reform, compassion requires conscience in order to work. On a solely pragmatic level, without appeal to a sense of duty, the mind of the dissident will remain unchanged.
Advocates of health-care change would do well to keep in mind America’s touchiness with the rhetoric of sacrifice. Our baseline moral assumptions frustrate the efforts of health-care reform advocates, who are in the uncommon and precarious position of asking U.S. citizens to sacrifice their autonomy for the greater good.
By skipping over the fundamental question of the rationale for reform, our legislators have taken the politically expedient route. And by ignoring Americans’ moral discomfort with issues of self-denial, reformers have allowed societal priorities to remain muddied. Providing moral clarity to the health-care debate would not have come without cost but would surely have offered direction to such an important national endeavor. Our marketplace of ideas might still be open to the discussion of all opinions, but a serious observer of today’s health-care debate could never guess it.

Two weeks ago, Sen. Joseph Lieberman used the lives of thousands of Americans as a bargaining chip. Of course, he did not phrase it that way. Instead, he threatened to join a Republican filibuster of any health-care reform bill that includes the choice of a government-run insurance plan, or “public option.” This could very well destroy the reform process entirely.  Given that even Sen. Olympia Snowe, the most liberal Senate Republican, will likely filibuster such a bill as well, such a vote would defeat the proposal in the Senate.
As even the most conservative bill under discussion would provide health insurance for 29 million more people, it is reasonable to blame politicians who defeat any bill for these people’s lack of insurance. These spoilers would thus bear some responsibility for the 45,000 deaths associated with a lack of health insurance that would continue each year after.
One would think that Lieberman’s superiors in the Democratic caucus would punish an action this blatantly immoral.  One would be wrong. Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid has “respect for [Lieberman’s] views,” fellow Sen. Tom Carper told The Hill. “I don’t even know if this is a punishable offense,” an anonymous Senate Democratic aide mused.
What is, then, an offense worthy of reprimand for today’s congressional Democrats? Ask Rep. Alan Grayson ’78. The freshman Florida congressman has striven to inject a strong sense of morality into the health-care debate and other floor fights. He famously characterized the Republican approach to health care as “don’t get sick, and if you get sick, die quickly,” and has continually used his floor speeches to highlight the deaths that result from America’s lack of national health insurance.
As one would expect, he was bombarded by Republican criticism and calls to apologize. But rather than defending one of their own, some Democratic leaders piled on. “I would encourage Alan to apologize,” Democratic Caucus Chairman John Larson told Politico. “Is this news to you that this guy’s one fry short of a Happy Meal?” asked Rep. Anthony Weiner, who is, if anything, to the left of Grayson on health care. To their credit, Speaker of the House Rep. Nancy Pelosi and the White House refused to condemn Grayson, but the damage was already done.
Such is the role of morality in the health-care debate. While most intuitively understand that a world with universal health insurance would lead to fewer deaths, bankruptcies, and other misfortunes than the status quo, politicians like Grayson who emphasize this fact are dismissed by colleagues as crazy. Those who wish to entrench the current system—or ,perhaps worse, those like Lieberman who are willing to entrench it if to do so serves their own ends—are above reproach. Their opinions are “respected.” Their cravenness is not even a “punishable offense.”
To be sure, there is a place for number-driven, dispassionate discourse in debates such as this. If we did not have congressional aides and independent analysts to provide cost and impact estimates, it would be impossible for legislators to make informed, moral decisions. Indeed, the American discourse on foreign policy has shown the costs of a focus on supposed morality at the expense of actual consequences. For example, the Bush administration’s refusal to negotiate regularly with the Iranian government, while grounded in a generally sound moral judgment of that government’s character, had the practical effect of allowing the Iranian nuclear program to progress substantially. Insofar as dispassionate factual analysis prevents this sort of moral indignation as policy, it is worth encouraging.
A problem arises when these analyses come to be appreciated for their own sake instead of as a means to a greater moral end. When Lieberman tells reporters that he opposes a public option because it will “end up increasing the national debt,” he not only spouts incorrect facts—the CBO estimates that a strong public option would save $150 billion over ten years—but he also misses the point. An increase in national debt does not in itself lead to negative moral consequences. If the goals of the spending—such as providing health care to the currently uninsured—are sufficiently worthwhile, the net result is almost certainly positive. But Lieberman is not interested in these kinds of moral discussions. An increased national debt is worth avoiding for him, regardless of that spending’s real effects on the lives of Americans.
The problem with this kind of statistical fetishism is not the craven dishonesty. Lieberman does not care a whit about the national debt, of course, but political disingenuousness is too common to provoke real outrage. The danger lies in the systemic politeness that allows it to fester. Politicians who embrace this amoralism deserve rebuke from their leaders, not the nonchalance with which the Democratic leadership met Lieberman’s actions. And those like Grayson who challenge it deserve better than to hear their moral seriousness condemned as madness.

At 12:01 a.m. yesterday morning, the three tickets vying for the Undergraduate Council’s top spots began their campaigns by blitzing their constituents with fliers and Web sites.
Later that day, exuberant supporters of both UC insider tickets attracted attention by chanting campaign slogans while waving their banners outside the Science Center, the annual marker of the UC Presidential Elections.
According to UC Election Commission rules, yesterday was the first day that candidates could publicly release information about their positions.
George J.J. Hayward ’11 and his running-mate Felix M. Zhang ’11 focused on Hayward’s record in an interview with The Crimson on Sunday.
“One thing we’re going to offer is a very strong record of getting tangible results for students,” said Hayward, who has earned a reputation for his work on Quad-related projects such as the installation of the AT&T service antenna earlier this year.
Both Hayward and Zhang—who also hails from the Quad—agreed that working to return hot breakfast to the Houses, which was cut last May, would be their first priority if elected.
“Hot breakfast and budget cut issues are our number one priority and a priority for any student at Harvard,” Zhang said.
They said that campus safety also needs improvement and that they plan to examine the cuts to the evening van services.
Despite the current budget crisis, Hayward and Zhang said they would ask the College to provide funding for the Harvard University Police Department officers who are required at large parties thrown by student groups.
Their rivals, John F. Bowman ’11 and his vice presidential candidate Eric N. Hysen ’11, kicked off their campaign with a launch party after midnight.
In an interview with the Crimson, Bowman and Hysen said they have extensive background in campus politics.
“We have a strong ticket with experience working on a wide range of issues,” said Hysen, who has been active on the UC since his freshman year.
Bowman has been a leader in protesting campus budget cuts, an issue which is a major focus of his platform.
Bowman said he and Hysen also plan to push for a more transparent and inclusive budget cuts decision-making process.
They said they also hope to advocate for student-led programming for next year’s January Term and will work to bring many Harvard services, such as events calendars and a study guide database, to a centralized online space.
“We plan to really protect Harvard at this moment of crisis, and yet improve Harvard’s student life,” said Bowman.
While there are three tickets in the race, the “Long-Johnson” ticket, comprising Hysen’s friends Robert G.B. Long ’11 and David R. Johnson ’11, seems to be taking the race less seriously.
“[Johnson] and I have both visited the UC Web site at least three times. We went to a town hall once where they advertised food, but it was gone by the time we got there,” said Long, when asked about his experience with student government. “And we have used the same bathroom as Eric Hysen.”

At 1:30 a.m. Monday morning, the Boston Police roused scores of sleeping protesters—including several Harvard students and top NASA climate scientist James E. Hansen—from their tents pitched on Boston Common, asking them to ready their identification cards.
The police issued nearly 70 citations for trespassing to the crowd, which had gathered to camp out in front of the Massachusetts State Legislature as part of The Leadership Campaign, a month-long effort encouraging sleeping in public places to draw attention to climate change. The Campaign is currently calling on Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 to introduce a bill to power Massachusetts with 100 percent renewable energy by 2020.
“We are trespassing...and could go to jail,” said Craig S. Altemose, who coordinated the student-led campaign and is also a joint law and policy degree student at the Harvard Law School and the Harvard Kennedy School. “But it is a small price to pay for a stable climate that will last 50 to 70 generations if we do this right.”
The Boston Common “sleep-out,” the largest manifestation of the campaign’s efforts, draws over 200 students, citizens, and clergy every Sunday to rally for climate and renewable energy. Students at universities across Massachusetts have also organized smaller scale camp-outs on their own campuses, Altemose said.
But students who have attempted to set up a Harvard sleep-out have faced resistance “across the board” from the administration, putting Harvard in a “small, small minority” of Massachusetts universities, said John E. Beatty ’11 who has received citations the past two Sundays.
“[The Office for Sustainability] and the Harvard administration are well positioned to implement policies that can be role models for other schools and organizations and make changes,” Beatty said. “The frustration is they don’t seem to be willing to let us do our part.”
Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson, who handles media concerns for the Office of Student Life—which Beatty visited several times to discuss the “sleep-out”—did not respond to repeated inquiries from The Crimson.
“For Harvard students, [arrest] really is a serious threat,” Beatty said. He explained that the most common Administrative Board sentence for student arrest is a mandatory six-month leave.
Beatty said he spoke to Associate Dean of the College John L. Ellison, who is also the secretary of the Administrative Board, as to whether the Ad Board would grant students an exception if arrested through the environmental protest.
“The ‘Handbook for Students’ is clear about the expectation the faculty has for student behavior and the standards of conduct expected of all Harvard College students,” said Ellison in an e-mailed statement to The Crimson in response to inquiries as to whether students who sleep-out will be granted an exception. “If a student violates those standards the Board is charged by the faculty to investigate and respond appropriately.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The student population in Cambridge may swell by another 300 undergrads in the next few years, due to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s tentative plan to increase the size of its student body.
MIT—currently home to 4,153 undergraduates—is considering increasing that number to about 4,500, according to MIT Dean of Admissions Stuart Schmill, though no plans have been finalized as to when or how the increase might occur.
MIT had approximately 4,500 undergraduate students throughout the 1980s and 1990s, according to Schmill, but the university reduced its class size when it began requiring all freshmen to live on campus.
“We’d like to educate more scientists and engineers for the nation and the world,” Schmill said. “That’s really the motivating factor for us to bring enrollment back up.”
Bloomberg News reported last week that MIT hoped to increase the class size as a means of raising revenue. Schmill denied this explanation, saying that admissions at MIT will continue to be need-blind in the future and that even the full cost of tuition does not cover all the expenses of students’ education. Instead, he said plans for a size increase have raised concerns about the costs more undergrads might entail.
“If you add one more student, it probably doesn’t increase your costs that much. If you bring in 20, it probably does—you might need to add an extra section of a class, and you need somebody to teach it. If you bring in 300, you have to house them somewhere. There are increased costs that come with that,” Schmill said.
A dormitory which has been under renovation for several years might be the key to housing the additional students, but Schmill did not know when that renovation will be completed. Administrators have also not decided whether MIT would grow its undergraduate class size by accepting a larger freshman class or by admitting upperclass transfer students.
Schmill said he did not anticipate that additional faculty would be hired in response to an increase in the number of students.
Harvard’s Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 expressed excitement about MIT’s potential size increase. “Anytime there are more spaces in America’s top universities I think it’s a good thing for our country and also a good thing for the world,” he said, noting that Princeton and Yale have each recently engaged in plans to increase their student populations.
Fitzsimmons also said he hoped news of MIT’s potential admissions increase might make elite universities appear more accessible and thus encourage students to apply to schools like Harvard as well.
“I think if it does turn out to be true,” he said, “it’s a win-win for everyone.”

Harvard Professor Michael J. Sandel challenged his audience to explore the moral dilemmas behind political controversies while presenting his latest book at the Harvard Book Store last night.
Sandel, whose new book is titled
“Justice: What’s the Right Thing to Do?,” argued that ancient philosophers are still participants in the arguments that preoccupy contemporary society.
“The idea of the book is to persuade readers, participants, and students that the convictions and opinions that we have, that we care about, rest on some of the big ideas about justice and the common good that philosophers have explored,” Sandel said.
“It’s an invitation to moral and political philosophy, and a richer public discourse to one we’ve been accustomed,” he added.
Sandel said that the tenets of many philosophers are rumbling underneath contemporary issues. He told the audience that although Aristotle’s ideas of justice seem unfamiliar because they require an assessment of what is just, their applications are recognizable in the questions that society struggles with.
“What was this discussion really about? It seemed to be a dispute about fairness,” said Sandel. “But if fairness was the only thing at stake, why were the easy solutions so objectionable? Could it be that, really, what was at stake was whether or not the institutions are worthy of recognition and honor?”
Sandel continued his discussion within a contemporary framework by prescribing certain conditions for improving the execution of justice and ethical action.
“I think one of the reasons that our discourse is so impoverished is that we rarely articulate the moral principles and the moral ideals underlying our positions,” he said.
“Even more rarely do we listen attentively and engage with the moral convictions of those with whom we disagree,” Sandel added.
Many audience members, including Bernie Steinberg, the president and director of Harvard Hillel, acknowledged the wide implications that Sandel’s book will have.
“This addresses a whole range of issues that are pressing, and Michael entices us to look into ourselves and to look into who we are by understanding the foundations of our thinking,” Steinberg said.

Though he cracked jokes and pointed enthusiastically at vibrant red, spiking temperature graphs, Richard B. Alley, a professor of geosciences at Pennsylvania State University, ended his presentation at yesterday’s Harvard climate change symposium with a grave warning.
“If you care about people,” he said, then you should be concerned about climate change.
In coordination with a meeting of the U.S. Arctic Research Commission, the Harvard University Center for the Environment held a symposium called “Climate Change: A Perspective from the Arctic” at the Northwest Science Building yesterday.
So many students and professors packed the lecture hall that some were forced to stand in the back.
The symposium featured a series of short lectures by preeminent scholars and researchers, including Harvard professors Daniel P. Schrag, James J. McCarthy, Peter J. Huybers, and James G. Anderson.
McCarthy began with an overview of the current climatic changes occurring in the Arctic, Huybers followed with a summary of Arctic climate variations during the past three decades, and Anderson closed the symposium with an exploration of Greenland’s future role in climate change.
These professors from the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences are “rockstars,” according to Environmental Action Committee Events Chair Tim L.H. Treuer ’10.
Fellow EAC member Karen A. McKinnon ’10 was similarly passionate.
“The effects of climate change in the Arctic may be a key part of understanding the puzzle of how climate change will affect the planet as a whole in the future,” she said, echoing many of the speakers.
Alley, the Penn. State professor focused on the sensitivity of the Arctic to climate change, saying that glacial melting as a result of even a minute increase in temperature “affects the ocean currents, it affects the wind currents, it affects a lot of things.”
Schrag said that he thought that the event was a huge success. He said the symposium is “one of the great things Harvard does” to promote interest in environmental issues.
According to Schrag, the Center for the Environment encourages the study of climatology with multiple programs throughout the year.
It “catalyzes and encourages [professors’] research” through fellowships and grants, he said, while simultaneously stimulating public interest through events such as the symposium.

The number of international students applying to Harvard’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences has increased this year, bucking a national trend of decreasing numbers of foreign students applying to U.S. graduate programs.
The Council of Graduate Schools survey, released today, found that while the number of Americans applying to domestic graduate programs increased six percent—the largest increase since an 11 percent uptick in 2002—the number of international students from certain countries has dropped as much at 16 percent.
“The lack of growth in first-time international enrollment raises questions about the future of our nation’s share of the global student market,” CGS President Debra W. Stewart said in the survey’s press release.
But the number of international students applying to Harvard’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences increased this year, according to GSAS Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid Russell E. Berg.
“I think we continue to be very attractive to international students,” he said. “Whether it’s happening across the country, I don’t know.”
Despite the current national trend lines, Stuart Heiser, manager of external affairs for CGS, said the Council will wait for additional surveys before drawing any conclusions.
He noted that increasing competition from graduate and undergraduate programs abroad has been a recurrent recent pattern. Top schools in Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong have all reportedly raised their enrollment numbers to accommodate regional students.
The survey reports a 16 percent decrease in graduate enrollment from India and a 13 percent decline from South Korea, while China was one of few countries to defy this trend with a 16 percent increase.
Tough economic conditions have added another layer to enrollment questions. At budget-strapped GSAS, increases in applications have not translated into increased international enrollments. According to Berg, GSAS sought to reduce this year’s class size to 2007 levels after large growth in 2008 because the school could not afford the generous financial aid that it offers to graduate students. The number of students admitted to GSAS departments either dropped or did not change.
CGS’s Heiser said that the global downturn may also have contributed to the fall in international students, who must be able to bear the cost of an American education.
Heiser said administrators expected increased applications as Americans began to seek graduate school education to improve their credentials in a tougher job market.
The next survey will be distributed to CGS universities in April regarding 2010 applications. “We may yet still see enrollment increases.”

The Harvard College Women’s Center hosted lesbian singer, songwriter, and activist Alix Dobkin for music, dinner, and discussion last night.
Susan Marine, director of the Women’s Center, described Dobkin as “a pioneer in the folk music scene and as a woman musician in general.”
Marine said she saw this event as an opportunity to highlight the idea of music as activism, feature women in non-traditional fields, and offer an inter-generational perspective to female college students.
Along with several students interested in feminism and music as a tool for social justice, many of those attending the event were personal friends of Dobkin who were involved in the folk music scene of the ’70s and ’80s.
“When I was coming out I was so afraid,” said Kathryn A. Willmore, former vice president of MIT and longtime friend of Dobkin’s. “And then I would put on Alix’s songs and they would tell me that I was moving to exactly the right place.”
In addition to playing several of her songs at the event, Dobkin read excerpts from her new book, “My Red Blood: A Memoir of Growing Up Communist, Coming Onto the Greenwich Village Folk Scene, and Coming Out in the Feminist Movement.”
In the readings and the discussion that followed, Dobkin emphasized her role and the role of music in the feminist movement of the 1970s. She said that her involvement with music for, by, and about women aims to send a political message.
“Music is the strength of this culture, the organizing force,” Dobkin said.
She added that she felt the goal of the music of her day was often a political message, and modern music has a less meaningful aim.
“Now everyone’s plugged in individually,” she said.
Willmore agreed that not only is music less geared toward sending a message, but campuses in general display less political perspective.
“These days, I don’t see a whole lot of activism on campuses,” she said. “Recent generations of students are focused on where they can get rather than challenging the order.”
Koshka M. Duff, a graduate student in feminist philosophy, also noted this emphasis on individualism, particularly with respect to issues of feminism.
“The element of organization and solidarity has been lost in recent feminist trends,” she said. “But I believe that social movements in general are moving toward more diverse tactics and offering really good ideas for how to change things.”

Fewer Harvard Business School students are entering careers in finance, a sign that global stock markets may be leveling off, according to the latest report of an HBS alumnus who correlates MBA career choices with long-term market performance.
The annual Harvard MBA Indicator, compiled by financial consultant and HBS graduate Ray Soifer, advises investors to sell when 30 percent or more of the Business School class enters finance and encourages investors to buy if 10 percent or fewer enter the sector.
This year, 28 percent of the Business School’s graduating class entered “market-sensitive” sectors, which include investment banking, hedge funds, and private equity, among others. That is down from a record high of 41 percent in 2008, according to Soifer’s report.
“It is a positive signal, but it’s not a ‘buy’ signal,” Soifer said, adding that the last time there was an unambiguous “buy” indicator was in 1983.
As more and more HBS students have been attracted to finance, the study has largely reported sell signals over the past decade. They were seen in 2000-2002 and 2005-2008. The years 2003 and 2004 were neutral.
Though she was unsure about the model’s value for investors, Managing Director of MBA Career and Professional Development Jana P. Kierstead said there seemed to be some correlation in recent years.
“In many respects, a correction like the one we’re experiencing allows students to focus and make different decisions,” Kierstead said.
On-campus recruiting by finance companies was noticeably down this year, and firms in the sector have made fewer offers to students they employed over the summer, according to Kierstead.
Patrick S. Chun ’04, co-president of the HBS Student Association, said that he sees students who might be interested in finance exploring careers in social enterprise, entrepreneurship, and government.
“Of course, with the taxpayers owning the largest banks, it’s hard to tell the difference between jobs in government and jobs in finance,” Chun quipped.
Soifer first considered the idea of a market indicator based on HBS during his days as a student there in the 1960s. He has monitored it ever since.
According to Soifer’s research, the indicator reached its all-time low in 1937, when only 1 percent of graduates went to work on Wall Street.
“If you had bought stocks in the fall of 1937, you’d have done pretty well since,” Soifer’s report said.

Most bright-eyed Harvard freshmen arrive in the Yard determined to make the most of their college experience by trying something new and different. Some learn a new language, some pick up dance or find a cause to advocate, and some find their way to the top of a nationally-ranked crew program.
When the Crimson’s top men’s lightweight crew pushes off at this weekend’s Head of the Charles Regatta, it will hold three men who showed up at the boathouse looking to try something new and found a passion that would dictate the course of their college careers.
“Coming here, crew just seemed like the quintessential Harvard sport, and it struck me as something really cool that I could do,” senior coxswain Dexter Louie says. “I didn’t know anything about it, but I figured I’d give it a shot. So I started, I walked on, and I just got hooked.”
Every fall, 60 to 80 Harvard freshmen show up at the introductory meeting for lightweight crew. About a dozen from each class will stick with it through the varsity level. And this year, three—Louie, senior Mike Silvestri and junior Jared Dourdeville—will be reprising their roles in the Crimson’s top boat.
Silvestri and Dourdeville both came to Harvard without previous rowing experience, but with athletic backgrounds and the desire to work hard.
“They both picked up the rowing stroke pretty easily—they were pretty natural that way,” says Crimson novice coach Linda Muri. “They will both work very hard. They both put in the extra time.”
Dourdeville rose through the ranks quickly, earning a spot in the top boat last spring as a sophomore—one of just three second-years in the boat, and the only walk-on of that trio.
“Jared is one of the hardest working guys on the team,” junior Ben Bayley says. “One time, we went out in a pair together, and it was just supposed to be a lighter pressure row. The whole practice, though, he just kept pulling me around, so we were never going on a straight course...The thing is, what’s ‘easy’ pressure for Jared is probably pulling super hard for everyone else.”
This season, the junior has taken over the stroke seat—a spot typically reserved for the most technically proficient rowers and is charged with setting the rhythm for the entire boat.
“For me, it’s been very rewarding to see the novice guys...pop up in the first varsity,” Muri says. “To see Jared stroking the boat this year, I feel like I’ve contributed a lot by getting him to the point where he can take over. Same thing for Michael and for Dexter and for any of the novices in the program.”
Dourdeville and Silvestri earned a silver medal at Eastern Sprints last spring, and capped off a successful season in the 1V with a bronze-medal finish at IRAs. Orchestrating the races was Louie, who has been the team’s top coxswain since last year’s Head of the Charles.
But coxing did not always come easily for the senior.
“I was one of those unfortunate coxswains that actually crashed the boat into the dock in the first few weeks, which is, like, the worst thing you can do as a coxswain,” Louie admits with a laugh. “So I was actually pretty far down the depth chart to begin with.”
Louie wasn’t alone in his early struggles. In fact, Muri finds training a new set of coxswains to be one of the tougher parts of her job.
“The hard part is getting them to be competitive—that’s one of the biggest challenges,” she explains. “And, at the same time, teaching them all this stuff about rowing when they’re not actually rowing.”
But the 5’6 California native stuck with the sport, competing in IRAs in his freshman season and hopping into the second varsity boat as a sophomore.
“[Louie’s] been very good at picking up the feel of the boat and being able to make calls, make comments...to the rowers while they’re rowing to change the feel of the boat,” Muri says. “And I’m not sure if that’s something I can teach, or that the varsity coach can teach. You have to be aware of that, and he has that sense, that feeling.”
As Louie has gained experience, his sense of the boat’s rhythm has only improved.
“The coxswain has to actively sense what’s going on in the boat—you don’t have an oar in the water,” Louie says. “All nine guys are sitting there and trying to make the boat go as fast as possible, but only one of them’s got the microphone. And unfortunately, that one is the one who can sense the least amount. So the best coxswains are the ones that are so good that they know all the ways to figure out how well the boat is going.”
Louie has also gained the respect of his rowers for his competitive drive and mastery of the art of coxing.
“One of the things I like the most about Dexter is the fire that he brings to the competitions,” Dourdeville says. “He can really, really get the motivation up for any race, especially the longer head races like we have in the fall. And that’s critical.”
In their second season in the varsity boat, these three now-seasoned walk-ons will look to row the Crimson back to the top of the national heap—an achievement they never would have thought possible on that first day in the Yard.
“The whole walk-on thing is pretty cool, because if you think about it, I came to Harvard just like anybody else,” Louie says. “And here I am, four years later, competing in one of the best lightweight teams in the nation. That’s kind of unbelievable.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Most of the time, calling someone two-faced isn’t a compliment. But Radcliffe heavyweight assistant coach Wendy Wilbur exemplifies what it means to be feared as a competitor and beloved as a teacher.
Wilbur joined the staff of the Black and White this season after spending four years as a full-time assistant at Boston College, and has made an immediate impression on everyone in the program.
“It’s great to have [Wilbur] on the staff,” says freshman Molly Griffin, who trained under Wilbur at a sculling camp over the summer. “She communicates really well and encourages you as an athlete and a human being.”
Wilbur’s ability to support rowers on and off the water stems from her own success as both an athlete and a coach.
As a member of the U.S. national team from 1997 to 2004, Wilbur earned a gold and a bronze medal as a member of the four and took silver with the eight in World Championship races. Wilbur can also claim a number of achievements in Cambridge, specifically two Head of the Charles titles in the championship double and championship eight—races that did not escape the attention of Radcliffe coach Liz O’Leary.
“[Wilbur] is an unbelievable competitor, a fierce competitor,” O’Leary says. “And that’s what I love about her.”
Yet while these accomplishments demonstrate that Wilbur understands what it takes to row at an elite level, the coach has found a different passion, working primarily with walk-ons. The former national team rower has shown that she can use her ability to connect with athletes to train rowers from the ground up.
“At the same time [that Wilbur is competitive], she’s probably one of the most friendly, kind, considerate people that you will ever meet,” O’Leary says. “[We chose her] for her experience as a coach, her experience as a collegiate and national team athlete, and for her ability to connect with and teach inexperienced rowers how to row...That’s why we’re so lucky to have her.”
For Wilbur’s part, after coordinating recruiting for the Eagles and assisting at the USRowing Under-23 development camp, the young coach jumped at the chance to work with one of the nation’s most prominent programs.
“I know that [Radcliffe] has a very talented staff, and I think they’ve always had really strong athletes,” Wilbur explains. “I saw it as an opportunity...to see if I could come in and provide some support.”
But while Wilbur’s skills as a teacher have come to be greatly appreciated, the rise in coaching prominence that has marked her career thus far was not always predictable. In fact, it was not until she finished college that Wilbur found her ideal profession.
“I worked for a corporate team-building company for a year, and one of the exercises they used for team building was rowing,” she explains. “I figured out from that job that I was most happy when I was coaching.”
And what Wilbur has come to enjoy teaching most is the basics. Given the opportunity to mold and encourage Radcliffe novices from day one, Wilbur has made a determined effort to instill strong mechanics in every member of the Black and White.
“I think the main thing is making sure that [the walk-ons] execute the basic part of the stroke well,” Wilbur says. “If you get a really strong sense of rowing from the basic parts, then you can continue to add more intricate pieces to the stroke. So I’ve been working with them on making sure that they learn the basics and learn them well.”
Although training the squad’s least experienced rowers may seem like an under-appreciated duty, rowers recognize the importance of solid instruction at every level.
“[Wilbur] is so positive and enthusiastic,” Griffin says. “The coaches are so great, and she’s just a great addition to an already great staff.”
After witnessing Wilbur’s impact with the novices, O’Leary has not hesitated to include the coach in varsity practice when possible. Due to the team’s staggered schedule, Wilbur has seen her role expand immensely as the year unfolds.
But the young coach’s focus remains on the novices, and she has a few plans for preparing the squad for its Nov. 7 opener. In particular, Wilbur will use the race in which she often displayed top-notch talent as a teaching tool for her walk-ons.
“The one thing I’m saying to novices right now is to make sure they get down [to the Head of the Charles] and watch the racing and look for the basics of the stroke,” Wilbur says. “If they’re able to see what we’re doing applied to racing, it gives them a better sense of where we’re headed.”
Perhaps the walk-ons will be lucky enough to witness a Charles River performance comparable to that of Wilbur’s in 1999. The weekend’s competition holds a special place for the former standout after her stunning victory in the championship double, a competition she was not even slated to race.
“[The double] was not an event I was training for,” laughs Wilbur, recalling her role as a sweep rower at the time. “But I was able to get in with my partner and win it because we were really fit and worked well together.”
The unexpected gold marked another memorable moment in an outstanding rowing career.
And while Wilbur may have shifted away from this competitive phase of her life, she has the opportunity to continue forging success along the banks of the Charles. With the tremendous work she has done as an assistant, she may soon find herself putting on a whole new face—that of a program’s head coach.

To many, the Head of the Charles means international competition and tricky turns around Weld and Eliot Bridges. To the Stones, it means family.
Ever since Gregg Stone ’75 graduated from college, he and his classmates have had reunions at every Head of the Charles, a major holiday for those in the rowing world.
“The hosts [of the reunion] would give all the kids little toys,” Gevvie Stone says. “I remember the Head of the Charles being kind of like Christmas—a yearly event you could mark your calendar for.”
The Head of the Charles has also been a source of athletic pride for the Stone family, as Gregg and Lisa both won the singles event in 1977 and their daughter Gevvie took the title last fall. Gevvie will be looking to defend her title in the single, while her brother Robbie—a sophomore on the Harvard heavyweight crew—will be rowing in the sophomore eight.
Gregg Stone has long been a staple on the Charles River, having won both the national championship and the Head of the Charles single scull race. But Gregg’s greatest legacy may have emerged from his and his friends’ efforts to keep themselves rowing during law school by starting the C.R.A.S.H.-B. Club—which originally stood for Charles River Association of Sculling Has-Beens (though it was later changed to the Charles River All-Star Has-Beens). Among the founders was Tiff Wood ’75, rowing legend and the subject of Harvard Class of 1955 graduate David Halberstam’s “The Amateurs.”
“In ’77, [when] I was at law school, we were trying to figure out ways to keep ourselves interested in rowing,” Gregg says. “We put a team in an eight, and we raced against any team that would race us. It was only later that the ergometer was invented [and] C.R.A.S.H.-B. started sponsoring the indoor rowing. That started out as a joke.”
Today, the C.R.A.S.H.-B. indoor rowing championship is considered to be the “Super Bowl of Erging,” and features rising juniors, college stars, veterans, and non-rowers alike. And the erg—an invention of Gregg’s friends, Dick and Pete Dreissigacker—has become a fixture in health clubs. The erg has revolutionized the way people think about rowing, with “erg scores” becoming essential information for recruits and aspiring national team members. But the idea originated with Stone’s extended family of Charles River rowers.
One standout from Gregg’s not-so-extended family is his wife Lisa, who has achieved success in both international rowing and high school coaching. Like Gregg, she won the singles event of the Head of the Charles in 1977. But her success is more likely to be discussed on the other side of the river at Radcliffe’s Weld Boathouse. Lisa served as head coach from 1983 to 1986 and—with current head coach Liz O’Leary as her partner—took bronze in the double in the 1977 and 1978 World Championships.
“In those days, it was a very big deal,” Gregg says. “The world was dominated by Eastern Europeans.”
Currently the head coach at the Winsor School, Lisa coached current Radcliffe rowers senior Anna Kendrick and sophomore Gillian Chase.
She also coached her daughter Gevvie, a former Princeton Tiger who has chosen to create her own path, initially looking to make her mark on the lacrosse field before realizing her potential on the river.
“My parents’ strategy has been, ‘Let her make her own decisions, and she’ll come to the right one,’” Gevvie says. “In sophomore year, I told myself that if I made varsity I would play lacrosse, and if not, I would row. And I didn’t make varsity, so my junior year I switched to rowing.”
Far away in New Jersey, Gevvie made her mark on Princeton’s program, as the team went undefeated and won the national championship in 2006. But Gevvie could not stay away from Weld Boathouse and the Charles River forever. She is currently attending medical school at Tufts and training out of Weld in hopes of rowing in the 2012 Olympics. But Gevvie achieved glory of her own in the single last fall when she won the Head of the Charles.
“It was very exciting, I have to tell you,” Gregg says. “She tried out for the Olympics, did not make it, and came back to med school.”
“Quite parallel to my past,” he adds, having tried out for the Olympic team himself before ending up in law school and winning the Head of the Charles in the single. “She did the same thing, sort of leaving the other boats behind.”
Gevvie’s two younger siblings also felt the allure of the Charles during their college years. Her sister Phoebe, a senior VES major, rowed in high school and was planning to row for the Radcliffe lightweights, but her career was cut short by back injuries.
“She has always been very supportive of me and my brother,” Gevvie says.
Although only a sophomore, Robbie has already had considerable success of his own on the Charles, both in high school and in his freshman year. At Belmont Hill, he won a national championship in the coxed four his junior year. Last spring, he rowed in the freshman eight that went undefeated in dual races and took silver at both Eastern Sprints and Intercollegiate Rowing Association National Championships. Robbie rowed in the stroke seat for much of the season before moving to the five-seat for IRAs. This weekend, he will be rowing with the members of last year’s freshman eight in the Head of the Charles.
Like his father, mother, and sister, Robbie will create his own experiences rowing on the Charles. It is not the similarities, but the differences of each Stones’ rowing experience that make the family’s connection to the Charles River so lasting.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Harvard men’s heavyweights hit the water at the Head of the Charles Regatta this weekend, they’ll be taking part in a competition that will, quite literally, play host to many of the best crews in the world—including national teams from the United States, Great Britain, and France.
But while the Crimson boats might be representing a college rather than an entire nation, Harvard too will boast a collection of rowers pretty comfortable on the global scene, headlined by varsity eight veterans Richard Anderson and Anthony Locke.
Anderson, a senior from Victoria, B.C., and Locke, a junior from Isle of Wight, Great Britain, raced for their home countries’ heavyweight eights at the Under-23 World Championships in Racice, Czech Republic this past summer.
In the first heat, Anderson’s Canadian crew edged out Locke’s Brits by just over two seconds to win. According to Anderson, his boat benefited from taking a more tranquil approach compared to its immediate neighbors.
“Australia was on one side of us,” he begins. “They started screaming, ‘Australia! Band of Brothers!’ And they were totally serious about it...On the other side, the Russians were there, and the Russians started doing the same thing—in Russian.”
The Canadians’ response?
“We were in the middle, so we started meowing like cats,” Anderson says. “Then we started singing ‘Sexy Can I?’...It was actually the greatest way to start the race because we were so relaxed.”
But even without the help of Ray J’s relatively recent hit single, Great Britain turned the tables in a thrilling final, taking bronze while Canada crossed the finish line in fifth.
“World finals are incredibly exciting,” Locke says. “It was one of the closest races I’ve ever had...It was definitely very high pressure, but exciting racing.”
But while racing at Worlds was compelling in its own right for Anderson and Locke, the training process that preceded it might have been just as valuable an experience.
Anderson and the Canadians had the opportunity to travel throughout Europe, training in places like Prague and Holland before making their way to Racice.
“It was actually a lot of fun, mostly for the camaraderie,” Anderson says. “It was the last year I was eligible [for the U-23 team]...We got to go through the whole experience of a really big event.”
Locke returned to his native Great Britain, where th e U-23 club loosened its restrictions on admitting rowers attending American colleges.
“Logistically, it’s been hard to make us come back and do the trials properly,” Locke says. “This year we kept in touch with coaches [and let them know we were ready]...It was good to go back to England.”
The rigorous training involved in preparing for international competition not only served to prepare Locke and Anderson for Worlds, but for what’s to come this year at Harvard as well. Next spring’s sprints season will be both rowers’ second on the varsity eight. But while Anderson and Locke are now experienced members of the heavyweights’ top boat, they took markedly different paths to get there—despite the fact that they both arrived at Harvard with plenty of international experience, as well as potential, in tow.
Locke’s ascension to the 1V was a swift one. Having rowed for the British team at Junior Worlds twice—once in an eight and once in a coxless four—an already-seasoned Locke took on a prominent role in 2008 on a freshman eight that won the EARC Sprints and took third at nationals. The following year, a spot on the varsity eight was secured, and he sat in the seven seat in every race.
“The one thing that I can point out about Anthony that is pretty unique is the way he treats the sport,” heavyweight captain Blake Pucsek says. “He’s very passionate about it...He always wants to do well for the sake of the program and not just to beat up on the other crew.”
Anderson also arrived at Harvard with experience in international waters, having also raced at Junior Worlds twice. But after his freshman year with the Crimson, Anderson needed a break from the sport that he had devoted much of his life to since he was 13.
“It seemed like the right time to take off,” Anderson says. “It was a good choice for me.”
Apparently so. Anderson returned to the team his junior year and impressed immediately, earning a spot for himself on the top boat.
Pucsek, who grew up minutes away from Anderson, marvels at the renewed drive his teammate displayed when he came back.
“What was neat for me was...seeing Richard with the same kind of drive he had when we were younger and still learning the sport,” Pucsek says.
Now Anderson and Locke begin anew, hoping a successful fall translates into an even better spring. But while their eyes are set firmly ahead, the Head of the Charles—with its thousands of spectators and international flavor—just may evoke memories of their formative Worlds experiences, albeit without the pressure, and possibly without the cat noises or Ray-J.
“It’s a giant competition, but it’s very friendly,” Anderson says. “To me, it’s more of a spectacle than a regatta.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For many Harvard athletes, their college careers mark the end of the road. Seldom does a Crimson player leave the ivy gates bound for the NFL, the NBA, or the MLB. But for many on Radcliffe crew, their feathering of the Charles River is just one step in an ongoing process to the top of their sport.
Take junior Olivia Coffey, for example. The Watkins Glen, N.Y. native spent this summer training with the United States Under-23 national team, culminating with a silver-medal finish at the World Championships in Racice, Czech Republic.
Of course, for Coffey, rowing runs through her blood.
“I met my wife [Margaret] at a rowing regatta,” says Calvin Coffey, Olivia’s father. “All my daughters row...But I never really pushed them to row. You can never make someone row, they either want to or not.”
Calvin was on the 1976 Olympic men’s pair that took home silver, and has spent most of his life building racing shells.
“It’s the culmination of a lot of rowing careers,” Calvin says of his Olympic showing. “It was my last competitive year rowing. That year, we were the only U.S. team to win a medal. The East German teams were all on steroids. Of the eight Olympic events, the East Germans I think won six gold medals.”
A graduate of Northeastern, it took some self-convincing to let his daughter attend cross-town rival Harvard.
“My dad wrote me a letter last year that said, ‘I never thought I’d say this, but Go Harvard, beat Northeastern.’” Olivia jokes. “It was probably pretty hard for him to say, but we keep [the trash talking] to a minimum in the house.”
Olivia, the youngest of the four Coffey girls, is the only one to row on the port side, a move that set her up to be the natural choice for the first-varsity stroke.
When considering Harvard, Coffey had to make a decision between playing hockey or rowing, two activities she excelled at in high school at Phillips Andover Academy. Ultimately, she opted for crew.
“I’m glad she did,” her father admits.
And while Olivia continues to pursue her national aspirations, she can rest assured that she’s not doing so alone. Many from the Black and White have blazed the trail before her, and Radcliffe boasts some new names with high expectations.
Now competing on the senior national squad, Esther Lofgren ’07-’09 served a vital role in shaping Coffey’s early career with the Black and White crew.
“I was really lucky to be able to train next to Esther because she’s done so many great things on the national level,” Olivia says. “And it’s nice to be able to see how you match up against someone who’s been there and has experienced everything. And there are a lot of things that she does differently that I wouldn’t have thought of, just rowing with Radcliffe. She had different training techniques, and it was nice to see someone work as hard as she did. So it gave me an idea of how hard you have to push yourself if you want to go to the next level.”
Lofgren took a year off during Coffey’s freshman year to train for the Beijing Olympic Games, and although she did not ultimately represent the United States in China, she appreciated the experience it gave her.
“I knew if I didn’t try it, I would regret it for the rest of my life,” Lofgren says.
Laura Nicholson ’09 is another name not unfamiliar with the world of professional crew. A teammate of Coffey’s on the U-23 squad—though a member of the women’s four, not eight—Nicholson has since gone on to Princeton to train with the U.S. national team.
“It’s a lot of getting used to the different training programs, larger volume, lower intensity,” Nicholson says of her new regimen. “It’s about adapting to a lot of new things.”
For Coffey, Lofgren and Nicholson welcomed her into the nationally-ranked Radcliffe program during her freshman year. But now a junior, Coffey has switched roles. For freshmen Michelle Pearson and Celia Kohl—both of whom will be on the first varsity boat—Coffey is a constant motivating force.
“I never hesitate to talk to her,” says Kohl, who trained with the junior national team the summer between her sophomore and junior years of high school.
Now poised between the past and future of Radcliffe crew, Coffey has earned the praise of both those she looked up to and those that look up to her.
“She’s an incredible athlete; she’s a great rower,” Nicholson says. “She’s great to compete with, to be on a boat with.”
“She has a very open, fun personality,” Kohl adds. “She’s an amazing rower, but she’s also got a great personality. It’s very comforting. She has a good mixture of intensity, but at the same time, she’s pretty laid back.”
And even her father is beginning to come around on Harvard.
“They are a very worthy adversary,” Calvin confesses. “It’s good healthy competition. I have nothing against Harvard. Go Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When junior Lizzy Bates takes to the varsity eight for her third-straight Head of the Charles Regatta as a member of the Black and White lightweights, she will be representing more than just the Radcliffe rowing institution. Indeed, her family’s lengthy history in rowing and competing in the Head of the Charles could be a rowing institution in its own right.
This weekend, the Bates family will watch Lizzy row in the six seat for the varsity eight, while her older sister Sarah—now three years removed from the Black and White—returns to the Charles River for the singles competition.
Despite her long association with the sport, Lizzy Bates wins high accolades from her fellow rowers for outstanding commitment to helping her teammates improve.
“One thing that I really appreciate about her [is that] when we’re on the water doing a piece, she always has something positive to say,” freshman Veronique Irwin says. “Even when she has constructive criticism, she won’t say anything negative without having something positive to say right after that.”
To Bates, all of the prestige of the Head of the Charles and the frenzy of spectators fades away once the race starts, and Bates shows the no-nonsense attitude and competitive spirit that propelled her onto the varsity eight after the first semester of her freshman year.
“For us, a race is a race, and it is great to get out there whether or not we have a lot of fans on the banks,” Bates says. “We definitely have a loyalty to the Charles. It is our river, and we row on it everyday. We just want to row the best we can on our river and take the turns sharply and row a great course.
But once that race is finished, Bates will have plenty of cheering to do as a spectator when her sister, Sarah Johnson ’06, takes on the competition in the singles event on Sunday afternoon. Johnson captained the Black and White lightweights during the 2005-06 campaign, and Bates spent her years in middle and high school attending the Head of the Charles to support her sister.
“She has a great tradition in her family,” lightweight coach Heather Cartwright says. “Her older sister still holds team records for the ergometer and stadium runs that haven’t been broken, but Lizzie, in her own right, is a very good rower.”
That family tradition even extends to other schools, as Bates’ brother David recently finished his tenure at the Naval Academy in 2008 and captained the Midshipmen’s lightweight crew during his senior year.
“Just like any big brother or big sister, before a competition, they help you get pumped up for the event,” Bates says. “[Sarah] is racing in the Head of the Charles in the single on Sunday at three, and it will cool to root for her.”
Sarah’s presence ensures that Lizzy won’t be the only family representative sprinting towards the finish line, something that occurred last year for the first time in four years.
It was a foreign experience and marked a significant change from Lizzy’s freshman season, when she took to the Charles along with her older brother and sister.
For this year’s regatta, her father and mother will also take time out of rooting for their children to join the army of volunteers as an umpire and a dockhand, respectively.
Beyond the strength of her family’s immediate ties to the Regatta, Bates points to this weekend as an experience that keeps her well-connected to decades-worth of the program’s alumni.
“We all look forward to the racing and seeing friends,” Bates says. “I know that many young alumni will be in town this weekend. It is neat to see older alumni as well because Radcliffe is such an old program, and the spirit of the sport and Radcliffe rowing is the same: timeless.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Martin Eiermann’s daily to-do list would likely overwhelm even some of the most ambitious Harvard students. Baking bread for friends in the Dudley Co-op, writing freelance journalism for a German political website, and working diligently on a senior thesis all get checked off when he turns in for the night. Oh, and he also happens to be a world-class rower.
Eiermann, the Harvard men’s lightweight crew captain, has built up quite a resume on the water, including numerous top-three finishes in Harvard boats at regional and national championships, as well as an impressive showing on the German senior national lightweight team at the World Championships this past summer. But while all of this rowing experience has certainly bolstered Eiermann’s abilities to lead the Crimson to success this year, his success on the water is only one aspect of his contribution to the Harvard community at large.
“In a sport where you have to have eight guys and a coxswain working together to get across the finish line, people have to work together on the water, but they also have to work together off the water too,” junior Jared Dourdeville says. “I think [Martin has] done a really good job of fostering that on the team.”
Over the past three years, Eiermann has established himself as one of the world’s most elite collegiate lightweight rowers. Just this past summer, he paired up with former teammate and fellow countryman, Moritz Hafner ’09, to represent Germany at the 2009 World Championships in Poznan, Poland. The two Harvard lightweights began the summer racing the lightweight pair, but soon found themselves promoted to the senior national team’s men’s lightweight 8+, with Eiermann setting the boat’s rhythm from stroke seat. Despite a disappointing sixth-place finish at the World Championships, Eiermann returned to Harvard this fall excited to bring his experiences to the team as captain and to pursue all that a senior year at Harvard could offer, on and off the Charles.
“I try to keep the stories [from this past summer] to a minimum,” laughs Eiermann when asked if he has been sharing moments from his Worlds experience with the team. His teammates describe him instead as a quiet and reserved leader who demonstrates intensity and strength by setting an example in work ethic for each of his teammates to follow.
“His experience on the national team this past summer really adds to his credentials as a captain on this team,” sophomore James Stewart says. “He clearly knows what he’s doing and has the highest level of competitive experience [to which we all] can aspire.”
Eiermann started rowing like most recruited collegiate oarsmen, for a learn-to-row program at his high school, Rabanus-Maurus Gymnasium in Germany. He competed at national competitions, but because there was not a lightweight event at the junior world level, he did not make the leap to the global stage until after entering college.
Eiermann spent some time in the United States during high school, on a year-long exchange program in Virginia, and found his way to the Harvard campus through a rather obscure connection.
“I knew some people who knew some people who had siblings here [at Harvard] or something,” explains Eiermann. “I came up to CRASH B’s [indoor rowing championships] and saw the university campus, met the coaches and just loved the feel I got.”
Eiermann was immediately attracted to the Harvard system, one in which he says it is “much easier to combine athletics and college because that’s just how the system is set up.”
Eiermann lives in the Harvard Dudley Co-operative Society, an alternative housing option for undergraduates. The Dudley Co-op houses 32 students and two resident tutors who do all of their own cooking, cleaning, and grocery shopping. Eiermann is the only athlete currently living in the Co-op, and it is another campus community in which he is an active participant.
“A lot of people are usually surprised that I live in the Dudley Co-op,” Eiermann says. “It’s almost easier to live there as an athlete and even a lightweight because everyone there already eats healthier.”
In interviews, Eiermann’s teammates can’t help but mention their captain’s hidden talent for bread-making, one of his tasks in the Co-op. Nor can they resist talking about his writing gig for a German political website.
“I interview people, I write posts, and I research stuff for this political website some of my friends began in Germany,” Eiermann says. “It’s really just free-lance journalism. It’s fun to do, and it’s on my own time so it works out well.”
Eiermann is somewhat of a Renaissance Man, but in the end, crew remains his priority. This weekend’s Head of the Charles Regatta begins competition for his lightweight squad, and the team’s performance may provide some insight into how they’ll respond when the sprint season starts in the spring.
“After the final [at Worlds], I was pretty bummed for a day or two,” said Eiermann. “But I just grew more excited for this coming season. We had a strong year last year, although we came up a little short at Sprints and IRAs. But this year, with a really strong sophomore class and a lot of upperclassmen returning, we’ll be right in it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Defense wins championships. It’s an old saying in sports, but Harvard men’s hockey might not be particularly convinced by it.
Take the series against Brown in last year’s ECAC playoffs, for example. It wasn’t the defense that let the Crimson down in the 1-0 and 2-0 shutout losses—it was the lack of offensive firepower.
This year, Harvard has brought in eight freshmen—six of whom are forwards—to add fuel to the offensive fire. The class, ranked fifth in the nation and first in the ECAC by Inside College Hockey, faces high expectations.
“I think more than previous years, [the freshmen are] going to be impact players for us right away,” captain Alex Biega says. “I think all eight of them have the ability to be tremendous assets to the team and step in right away and play.”
The incoming group will be an important part of Harvard’s plan to become quicker and more exciting in the offensive zone.
“[The freshmen are] all capable of having an impact offensively,” says Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “We really feel there’s a lot of upside up front in that freshman class.”
“I do think, offensively, we really [are ready] to open up the culture as far as creativity and speed,” he adds.
The class of 2013 is headlined by Louis Leblanc, a 6’0, 180-pound forward who was selected by the Montreal Canadiens in the first round of the NHL Draft this June. Leblanc is just the second Crimson player and seventh ECAC player ever to be selected in the first round.
“He’s a kid who’s going to bring it every night,” Biega says of Leblanc. “He has great skill sets, and he’s a very gritty player.”
The first-year played for the Omaha Lancers last season and was named Rookie of the Year in the United States Hockey League. Leblanc, who scored 28 goals and recorded 31 assists for the Lancers in 60 games, will be counted on immediately to produce around the net.
“Louis Leblanc obviously is a guy that brings a great...work ethic, and has always been able to provide offense,” Donato says. “So I think we expect him to be an impact guy for us.”
Another player who will be expected to put up points is forward Alex Fallstrom, who was selected in the fourth round of the NHL Draft by the Minnesota Wild and then later traded to the Boston Bruins. The 6’2 power forward calls Stockholm, Sweden home, but Fallstrom spent the last two years playing for Minnesota’s Shattuck-St. Mary’s School, a program perennially ranked among the nation’s best.
The Crimson will also look for goals from newcomer Conor Morrison, who represented Germany at the 2009 IIHF World Junior Championship. He spent the past two years in the British Columbia Hockey League, where he was second on his team in points last season. He hails from a hockey family, as both his father and grandfather played and scouted for the NHL.
Marshall Everson, Luke Greiner, and David Valek round out the forwards in the freshman class.
With the addition of the talented attackers, Harvard will look to become a more explosive squad. According to Donato, the Crimson will put an extra emphasis on being aggressive and dangerous in its opponents’ zone.
“Obviously in the freshman class, there’s a lot of offensive talent,” junior Michael Biega says. “From what we see in practice so far, we’re really working on moving the puck faster and being a new, fast team.”
On defense, Harvard adds two players: Brendan Rempel and Danny Biega. Danny, the younger brother of Alex and Michael Biega, is an “A” North American prospect for the 2010 draft, according to NHL Central Scouting. The 6’3 Rempel is a strong, defensive-minded blueliner who played for the United States U-18 team.
“I think it’s just a great group of guys,” Leblanc says. “We’re pulling [in] the same direction right now and hopefully good things will happen. I think...we’re going to have to step up and be a part of this team and prove we can play in the lineup.”
Though the freshmen come from different backgrounds, most have played with or against each other in the past. As far as connections go, Leblanc and Danny Biega are familiar with each other since both grew up competing in the same junior hockey leagues in the Montreal area. Valek and Rempel were teammates on the United States U-18 team. Fallstrom and Greiner played together for Shattuck-St. Mary’s two years ago.
“We’ve brought eight great kids, and the chemistry since I’ve been here has been second to none,” Alex Biega says. “I think people should look forward, and it’s going to be a very exciting year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just over midway through the first period in the Harvard women’s hockey team’s exhibition game against McGill on Saturday, Jillian Dempsey readied herself for a faceoff in the Martlets’ zone.
The puck dropped, and Dempsey pounced. The freshman zipped a pass behind her to co-captain Kathryn Farni, who found junior forward Kate Buesser streaking towards the net. Buesser went top shelf for the goal, and just like that, Dempsey had her first assist in a Crimson uniform.
There will be more assists for Dempsey, and goals too. But for the Winthrop, Mass. native, that one point in an easy 4-1 Harvard win represents the realization of a dream that’s been a long time coming.
“It was just surreal to hear ‘Dempsey’ on the loudspeaker,” she says. “Just the whole experience—putting on the jersey in the locker room...all the pregame rituals that the Harvard team does. Being out there on the ice was amazing.”
In a sense, the beginning of Dempsey’s Crimson career is an end—an end to a seven-year-long quest to play for Harvard. Since she saw the Crimson women take the ice for the first time as a sixth grader, Dempsey knew she wanted to play college hockey in Cambridge. From that point on, there was no debate about where she would end up—despite her high school coach’s attempt to initiate one—only the question of how she would get there.
“When she came in as an eighth grader,” says Kristen Harder, Dempsey’s coach at the Rivers School in Weston, Mass., “a lot of decisions she made in terms of what courses she was going to take, how hard she was going to work for her grades, all of those decisions were driven by a decision to go to Harvard. I couldn’t even get her to visit another campus.”
But while Harvard was always the final destination as she mapped out her future hockey plans, Dempsey certainly did not take a well-traveled path in getting there.
For a young skater from Massachusetts striving to play for a perennial national contender like the Crimson, one of the myriad New England prep schools with established girls’ hockey programs might have provided an ideal fit. But a boys’ coach from Rivers who was scouting Dempsey’s brother informed her that the school was starting a girls’ varsity team.
While Dempsey anticipated the challenges of playing for a brand new program, she was attracted to Rivers’ strong academic environment and felt comfortable at the school after interviewing.
“It was a great school, and it looked like something I would really like to attend,” Dempsey says. “I was going pretty much because of the school. I knew the hockey team was brand new.”
In Dempsey’s first season, when she was an eighth grader on the varsity team, the Rivers squad struggled mightily, consistently falling in blowouts to more experienced teams.
“That first year, we weren’t terribly competitive because all of our best players were eighth and ninth graders,” Harder says.
But even in that trying season, signs of the determination and intensity that would define Dempsey’s playing style and inspire the rest of her teammates began to emerge.
“One game we had held a tough opponent to only seven goals with a minute left to go,” Harder recalls. “Jill got a breakaway and scored...Our celebration was as if we had tied it up to put it into overtime.”
Over the next few years, Rivers began to win games, and Dempsey began to establish herself as the team’s leader and one of the nation’s top prep school prospects.
“When she was 13 and first started here,” Harder says, “most people could count maybe 20 13-year-olds who were clearly better than she was—not my words. [But] I watched her drive and knew that anyone better than her as an eighth grader would have to seriously challenge themselves to be better as a senior.”
Dempsey’s progress not only caught the attention of her coach, but Team USA evaluators as well. After attending several national team development camps, Dempsey was selected to the United States U-18 squad, which took gold at the 2009 World Championships in Germany.
“Singing the national anthem on the blue line,” Dempsey recalls. “It was a dream.”
Dempsey’s ultimate goal is to make the U.S. Olympic team, but for now she’s living another, older dream: playing for Harvard.
While the Crimson is by no means rebuilding and expects to remain among the nation’s top squads this season, some aspects of Dempsey’s situation at Harvard reflect her early days at Rivers. Since the Crimson has graduated its top three scorers (Sarah Vaillancourt ’08-’09, Jenny Brine ’09, and Sarah Wilson ’09), it will be looking to its freshmen—especially Dempsey—to make an immediate impact.
“[The freshmen] are going to get opportunities right off the bat that other kids have not had in the past because of numbers or elite players being in the program,” Crimson coach Katey Stone says.
Stone says that for Dempsey, the key is “for her to just kind of get herself comfortable and realize, ‘Hey, I can do this.’”
Dempsey’s early showing against McGill, and the confidence of her coach and teammates, seem to indicate that she’ll be up to the task. But while she’s poised to contribute right away, her success at Harvard will still be determined by her ever-present desire to improve.
“She’s always looking to get better,” Crimson co-captain Cori Bassett says. “We make fun of her a little bit for asking so many questions, but it’s just because she’s constantly looking for ways to get better and to challenge herself.”
It’s an approach that Dempsey has employed from Day 1, and because of it, she’s living the dream—or at least one of them. But there are others, and precedent indicates that whatever Jillian Dempsey dreams up seems to come true.
“She is a very talented player, but because of how hard she works, neither Harvard nor anyone else has seen the best that she is going to be,” Harder says. “She’s starting off at a very high level, but I would not count this player out for anything in the world. She can do whatever she wants.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What a difference a year makes.
This time last October, Harvard was scrambling to fill the goalie position, looking to three untested netminders to act as anchors of the team’s defense.
But with the return of star goaltender Kyle Richter—as well as the recent rise of up-and-coming junior Ryan Carroll—the Crimson appears to be in better shape at the start of this season than it was last year.
“We’re having a real positive feeling, and have a lot of reason to have optimism,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 says. “Last season we came to a spot where we didn’t have a goalie to start the season that had played in a college game. This year we’ll have three. And although he’s been off for a little bit, when Kyle Richter left us, he was the goalie of the year in our league. Ryan Carroll played very well last year, and I think John Riley has developed a lot since he arrived. We feel a lot stronger in that position than we have been in a long time.”
Although there are now two other contenders for the job, Richter, a junior, seems poised for the top spot.
Before his start in last week’s exhibition game against McGill, Richter’s last time out on Harvard ice was the 2007-08 season, in which his strong performance in the crease earned him the Ken Dryden Award as the ECAC’s best goaltender.
That season, the Calgary, Alberta native notched a .935 save percentage in league play as well as a 2.19 goals-against average overall.
In his 34 games, Richter made a total of 884 saves, and he secured 37 or more saves in four contests, including a 39-save overtime victory against Boston University. He posted three shutouts, including back-to-back shutout victories, making him the first Crimson goalie to accomplish such a feat in over 25 years.
And to top it all off, he became the first Harvard netminder to ever score a goal when he found the net in a 6-1 blowout against Yale in February 2008.
Despite his historical strength between the pipes, there still remains some uncertainty over how Richter will size up after his year-long absence from Bright Hockey Center.
“There absolutely is some concern,” Donato says. “He hasn’t played in a year. Although he worked out with a goalie instructor, he wasn’t playing in games...There is a bit of unknown, just the fact that he’s been off for a while.”
But Richter’s high level of experience, as well as his existing relationships with his teammates, should ease his transition back into Harvard hockey.
“I know most of the guys on the team, so it’s not like I’m starting fresh again,” Richter says. “Getting back into it, they’ve made me feel really comfortable right from the start. But at the same time, there’s a lot of competition and energy in practice. Obviously, I’ve got to bring my game again this year, so there’s that competitive side to it as well.”
The starting job is Richter’s to lose.
With Carroll eager to take the reins, Richter will undoubtedly face some serious competition this year.
Carroll’s breakout performance at the end of last season put Harvard back on track after its winter slump and earned him the starting position for the final nine games of the year.
Carroll first made a splash against rival Boston College in the consolation game of the Beanpot, in which he made 42 saves—matching Richter’s career high—before yielding the  game-winning goal in the final minute.
By the end of the season, Carroll held a .946 save percentage and a 1.90 goals-against average, and had contributed to the upset of two ranked teams in the Crimson’s late-season resurgence.
While he returns to the backup spot upon Richter’s arrival, there’s no saying he can’t work his way back up to the top.
“Ryan Carroll, he’s a great goalie as well as a good friend of mine, so we push each other a lot in practice,” Richter says. “I kind of look at it with the same mentality every time. In practice, you’ve got to do your best regardless, whether you’re starting or not.”
“Now there’s a lot more competition, but I guess competition just breeds playing well,” Carroll agrees. “You work hard and play well, and whoever’s playing well will get in the net, so every time you step on the ice, it’s the same feeling—you just try to play your best.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Radcliffe lightweight crew is aiming to pick up right where it left off last season, and the Head of the Charles offers an initiation into one of the sport’s most prestigious regattas. Whether aiding the team through injury, generating enthusiasm among spectators, or rowing in the boats, Radcliffe’s freshmen are eagerly anticipating this weekend’s events.
“Excellence is no longer our goal but our standard,” captain Grace Hollowell writes in an e-mail. “We’re also working to integrate our freshmen into the program smoothly, forming a cohesive team, forming a uniform technique, physical power, and attitude.”
One freshman, Erin Flynn, is already well on her way to meeting these standards despite entering the season on the assumption that she would remain on the banks for the entire fall. Shoulder surgery in July to repair a torn rotator cuff prevented Flynn from rowing, but the freshman responded with some flexibility of her own by taking up a position as the team’s third coxswain.
Learning a new position at the collegiate level brings a new level of challenge and responsibility, especially when one considers that the coxswain is responsible for guiding the boat safely to the finish line and executing the race strategy.
“This is both impressive and [shows] a great sense of dedication to the team,” Hollowell says.
Flynn knows the extreme bends and curves of the Charles River thanks to her high school experience at Head of the Charles when she raced a double last year.
“I was the stroke, I didn’t have to do any of the steering,” Flynn says. “I remember thinking that if I ever had the opportunity to row on the Charles, I would definitely take it. I feel really lucky being able to cox on the Charles.”
Flynn has already showed coach Heather Cartwright—who first floated the idea of coxing at the season-opening meeting—tremendous promise by adapting to the rhythm of a fast boat and navigating some of the most challenging turns of any race course.
Though the third varsity eight will not compete this weekend, Flynn will debut her new skill set at the Foot of the Charles Regatta early next month. But cheering from the banks of the river still offers ample opportunity for contributing to the team’s success.
“The upperclassmen have told me that, when we’re around the banks wearing our Radcliffe gear, alumni will come up to us and talk about their own Radcliffe experiences,” Flynn says. “I’m looking forward to being part of the team at this.”
Even rowers who are not taking to the water this weekend will be doing all that they can to support their program and show their pride for the Black and White.
“We certainly have our walk-on group participate to cheer on their teammates, [run the] traditional bake sale, and [sell] some logo gear to the public,” Cartwright says. “And they get to represent their team and talk about being a team member. It is the first time they are seen as a team member by the Radcliffe crew”
Freshmen Erika McCormick and Veronique Irwin will occupy the bow and two seats of the varsity eight this weekend. Both rowers have witnessed the spectacle of the event before. McCormick spent her junior and senior years of high school racing in the youth eight while Irwin twice attended the event as a spare with the Westside Rowing Club from her hometown of Buffalo, N.Y.
McCormick is particularly excited that the Head of the Charles represents an annual gathering of the rowing community that spans so many generations of rowers and fans.
“People come from all around the world,” McCormick says. “You have young rowers, masters, and Olympic medalists. It is really an inspiring experience, and you get to see people who love the sport so much that they continue to compete until they’re very old.”
In similar fashion, Irwin, recounting the event as a high school rower, looks forward to reconnecting with her club’s current teammates and young alumni.
“The Head of the Charles was this once-a-year opportunity for everyone who had once been on my club team to come together again,” Irwin says. “Now, as a graduate of my club, something that I have been excited to do is to be in the position of the college student returning.”
For the Black and White to carry home the top prize this weekend, both McCormick and Irwin will need to demonstrate the kind of talent that propelled them to the varsity eight as freshmen.
“[Erika and Veronique] are sitting in the important two seat and bow seat,” Cartwright says. “In this race, you need to have a cool head and keep your wits about you. Both of them demonstrate cool under pressure, which is unusual for a freshman.”
Regardless of the outcome, representing Radcliffe at the Head of the Charles is sure to be one of any rower’s most memorable experiences on the team.
“For new rowers to see this great moment and be part of this experience is inspiring,” Cartwright says. “Many girls, if their freshman year is their first one rowing, have later told me that [Head of the Charles] is what got them excited about the sport.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After its tournament dreams came tumbling down in shocking fashion last March, the Harvard men’s hockey team has high hopes of improving upon the disappointing up-and-down 2008-09 season and making it back to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2006.
Last year, the team started off strong at 4-2-0, but hit a massive mid-year skid, going 1-12-4 through the middle of the season. The squad turned it around late in the year, finishing the regular season 4-0-2, but was stunned in the first round of the ECAC tournament by conference bottom-dweller Brown, which won two consecutive games at Bright Hockey Center to end Harvard’s season.
It was a strange finish for a team that had made it to the ECAC championship round six times in the last seven seasons, winning three of them.
The Crimson’s aspirations for improvement in 2009-10 rest on the shoulders of junior goalie Kyle Richter, who returns to the team after a one-year absence, and a recruiting class that Inside College Hockey ranked fifth-best in the nation.
At the head of the freshman class is Louis Leblanc, widely considered the best forward recruit in the country. Leblanc was last season’s USHL Rookie of the Year and the 18th pick in the 2009 NHL Draft by his hometown Montreal Canadiens.
“We feel like we’ve added some real offensive potential to our lineup,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “Not only do we think that we’ve added some in the freshman class, we think there’s a lot more potential in some of the guys that were here.”
Among those already here include captain and preseason All-American defenseman Alex Biega—who had 16 assists last year—and senior center Doug Rogers—who led the team with 21 points last season. The duo is a key portion of an offense that returns its top seven leaders in points.
The Biega family earned national attention this season when freshman Danny decided to join his brothers Alex and junior Michael (third on the team with 17 points in ’08-’09) on the Crimson squad.  And Alex believes that his brothers can be part of a larger group of Harvard players expected to show improvement this season.
“A lot of players on our team are poised to have breakout years,” Alex Biega says. “They’ve had great summers and have had great training both on the ice and off the ice, and I think with the freshmen, we’ve added a lot of depth.”
Donato hopes that Michael Biega and sophomore Alex Killorn can be two of those breakout players.
“Over the summer, I’ve been working a lot to get a lot faster, which I believe I have,” Michael says. “Hopefully that will help me break out this year and have a good season.”
Donato believes that the combination of an elite freshman class and improvement from his returning core will improve the offensive firepower of a team that finished second-to-last in goals scored in the ECAC last year, and did not have any player in the top 40 in points or plus-minus for the conference.
“We want to get after teams,” Donato says. “We want to be much more aggressive offensively. It looks [like] we’ll be a lot more dangerous. We’ve added—I think—some good speed, skill, and it seems to be mixing in very well with the guys that are returning. I think there’s a lot of reason for optimism as far as what this team can accomplish offensively.”
Another reason for optimism is the return of Richter, who took a leave of absence after winning the Dryden Award as the league’s best goalie as a sophomore in 2007-08, when he lead the ECAC in goals-against average and save percentage.
While he will face stiff competition to keep his old job from returning junior goalie Ryan Carroll—who improved down the stretch last season—Donato says he plans to start Richter to open the year.
“I think we feel a lot stronger in that position than we have been in a long time,” the coach says of his goaltending.
Harvard’s hopes for an improved offense and better goaltending have given the team high expectations for its 110th season.
“We feel that we have a chance to be around at the end,” Donato says. “I think as a team, [we] want to get back to the NCAA Tournament. [We] want to get back to the ECAC final four, the ECAC championship game.”
National polls seem to indicate this is a possibility. The expanded Preseason USA Today/USA Hockey Magazine Poll has Harvard tied for 24th in the country, and the expanded Preseason USHCO.com/CBS College Sports Division I poll ranks the Crimson 23rd.
After an exhibition tie with McGill, Harvard opens its season tonight at Dartmouth.
From then on, the Crimson will face a tough stretch on the road against ECAC rivals No. 6 Cornell and No. 9 Princeton. Although Harvard will settle into a seven-game run at home, its opponents include defending national champion No. 4 Boston University and No. 12 Boston College. The Crimson will go head-to head against non-conference challenger Minnesota before jumping into the Beanpot Tournament at TD BankNorth Garden in February.
“If we’re going to be successful,” Alex Biega says, “we’re going to have to shoot for the stars...it’s anyone’s title in any given year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The ninth-ranked Harvard women’s hockey team, having won the previous two ECAC Hockey regular-season and Ivy League titles, looks to continue a tradition of success in the 2009-10 season. Despite having graduated its top three offensive contributors last year, the Crimson plans to capitalize on what has always made it one of the most competitive teams in the nation: speed, creativity, and grit.
“Our biggest focus is to not focus on what we lost,” co-captain Cori Bassett says, “but [on] what we have at this point. It’s hard to look back because we lost an Olympian and our top scorers. Now, we’re looking for everyone to contribute offensively and defensively.”
Harvard finished the 2008-09 season 19-10-3 overall with a disappointing loss to Rensselaer in the semifinal round of the ECAC tournament. The final outcome left the Crimson counting down the days until its return to Harvard’s Bright Hockey Center and another opportunity to make it back to the NCAA Tournament.
The Crimson will have to face opponents this year without its top three scorers from last season—Sarah Vaillancourt ’08-’09, Jenny Brine ’09, and Sarah Wilson ’09. While the personnel may be different—as well as younger, with seven freshmen joining the squad—Harvard’s basic strategy will remain the same.
“One of the things we’ve always had in the past is speed,” co-captain Kathryn Farni says. “And it is something that we still have this year, so that is going to continue to be our focus; to drive to the net hard.”
Harvard coach Katey Stone begins her 16th season at the helm of the Crimson. Stone ranks second in all-time wins among Division I head coaches with 319 career victories. She has a definitive coaching style that demands hard work and calls for improvisation from every player.
“Coach has given us a lot of systems to run,” Bassett says. “But [she] has left a lot of the creativity to us, in terms of [the] offensive zone and how we forecheck and what we do once we have the puck.”
Each year’s team brings different skills and talents to the rink, and this year Harvard will look to each individual to step up and fulfill her role on the team. The Crimson’s approach to finding the net this season may look different than in years past, as Stone will tinker her game plan to cater to the strengths of her current crop of players.
“We’re looking to probably score a lot of second- and third-chance goals versus the clean transition goal that in the past we’ve been able to score,” Stone says. “However, I would say we’re looking to create a lot more offense from our blue line because we’ve got some kids who can shoot the puck.”
That blue-line effort will be anchored by Bassett and Farni, along with junior Leanna Coskren. Bassett was the team’s top-scoring defenseman last season, recording 14 points despite missing five games with an injury.
But the Crimson is strongest in net, where senior Christina Kessler will once again take her place between the pipes. Kessler, an All-American in her sophomore season, has been the top netminder in the ECAC for two years running and posts a career .941 save percentage and 1.35 goals-against average.
In addition to junior Katharine Chute—Harvard’s leading returning scorer from last season—the team is bringing in a string of talented freshmen, including three forwards, three defensemen, and one goalie. Having graduated the core of its offense from last season, there is a huge opportunity for anyone, including the rookies, to step up and define her role on the team.
“At the end of the game, we’re not going to be looking to that one person to score the goal,” Farni says. “We’re going to be rolling all three lines. And [we’re] all going to have to take it on ourselves and then just see who’s going to be the one to put it into action on the ice.”
This season presents a lot of new challenges and possible opportunities for the team, aside from the obvious personnel changes. The new academic calendar meant returning to campus and starting a rigorous training schedule earlier than in years past.
“This is the longest preseason we have had because we came back so much earlier this year,” Bassett says. “So we’ve had a lot of time [to] get to know each other really well, and we just can’t wait to start playing games.”
The fact that it is an Olympic year means that the face of the whole league is changing and casting some uncertainty over the competition that Harvard will come up against in its typically challenging schedule.
“It’s not like people’s star players are necessarily returning this year,” Farni explains. “We’re going to see a lot of unexpected teams do well and a lot of team’s who normally do well, not perform as well as expected. It’s not rebuilding necessarily, it’s just taking time to figure out the new dynamic of the team and of the whole league.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s a dream all little girls share—to one day grow up and become the athlete, actress, or singer they’ve always admired. Not so long ago, five little girls were lacing up their skates and dreaming about playing Olympic hockey.
Now all grown up, those five Harvard alums—Jennifer Botterill ’02-’03, Angela Ruggiero ’02-’04, Julie Chu ’06-’07, Caitlin Cahow ’07-’08, and Sarah Vaillancourt ’08-’09—have the chance to once again make that dream a reality.
As the 2010 Vancouver Games approach, the women—all veterans of at least the 2006 Olympics—are hoping to get another chance to represent their countries on the biggest athletic stage of all.
“Even though I’ve gone through it a couple of times—and I’ve been fortunate enough to do that—I think we all have to remember to stay in the moment and not take anything for granted,” says Chu, who is shooting for her third Games. “This is something really special that we’re really fortunate to be a part of.”
For the quintet of skaters, their international stories started young—at 20, Cahow and Vaillancourt were the oldest to make their Olympic debuts when they skated in Torino in 2006. Botterill, Ruggiero, and Chu, on the other hand, donned their national jerseys before ever stepping on the ice at Bright.
In Ruggiero’s and Vaillancourt’s cases, their first Olympics brought a gold medal. But for all, it was an experience that guided the rest of their hockey careers.
“It’s something I could have never dreamed up, that I would be able to play in the Olympics in high school and win a gold medal,” Ruggiero says. “It definitely gave me a lot of confidence, I think, heading into college and my collegiate hockey career, and just knowing that I had the Olympics to shoot for—in addition to training with the national program—kind of helped me push myself every day at the rink.”
Though Olympic success may have marked the beginning of the quintet’s careers, it’s just the highlight of an impressive collective resume.
Botterill and Ruggiero spearheaded the Crimson’s 1999 national championship effort. Four of the five have won the Patty Kazmaier—given annually to the best player in collegiate women’s hockey—with Botterill winning it twice. Among them, they have a total of 12 Frozen Four appearances, 14 world titles, and 10 Olympic medals—four of them gold.
But despite the large-scale success they have had, the quintet stays true to its Harvard hockey roots.
“The level of discipline and dedication that Coach Stone demands and that our team culture fosters really is inexplicable to those who aren’t directly involved with it,” Cahow says. “But it just really pushed me to take ownership over each day that I was on campus, and I’ve tried to bring that to my international hockey career as well.”
All five alums are currently participating in their national centralization programs, the Americans in Blaine, Minn. and the Canadians in Calgary, Alberta. The teams are playing a slate of exhibition games as the teams begin to finalize their Olympic rosters, which will be announced in December.
The American team, with a bad taste in its mouth from a shocking loss to Sweden in the 2006 Olympic semifinals, is a younger squad than it has been in the past. In fact, the three Harvard skaters make up half of the returning Olympians on the tour roster.
“Our youth can only help us when it comes to enthusiasm, and we’ve got young legs on the ice right now,” Cahow says. “Nobody’s going to be tired in the third period because you’ve got a lot of get-up-and-go. You’ve got players who want to be out there, players who are in great shape and are ready to go.”
Though the Americans will enter the Olympics ranked No. 1 in the world for the first time on the strength of two consecutive world titles, it’s the Canadians, fielding a team with more Olympic experience, that will have home-ice advantage.
“I think every athlete’s dream is to one day play in the Olympics, and every Olympian’s dream is to have the chance to play an Olympics in their country,” Vaillancourt says. “We know that every game is going to be packed with people and crazy fans. It would be a different kind of dream come true again.”
Canada and the U.S. will play in separate round-robin groups in Vancouver, so if all goes well, the top two teams in the world are lined up to renew their rivalry in the gold-medal game.
“For both teams, we know that usually when we play, it’s a really competitive game,” Botterill says. “I think those are the games that are most fun to play in, where you know you have to be ready. You have to be ready to compete and perform at your best.”
The Harvard family in Vancouver will be missing a member—coach Katey Stone. Stone was one of three candidates to coach the American team in 2010, and in that capacity, she coached Chu, Ruggiero, and Cahow at last year’s Four Nations Cup.
“It was just a blast,” Ruggiero says of having Stone back behind the bench. “She’s someone that really cares about you as a person...and so to have her be able to coach me and Julie and Caitlin one more time was pretty special.”
In the end, the Olympic job went to Wisconsin coach Mark Johnson.
“There’s disappointment, sure there is,” Stone admits. “When you commit yourself to the development of the game in this country, and when you feel like you’ve done well developing talent here, as well as being successful, it’s certainly something you want to be a part of.”
Though Stone will be happily home in Cambridge coaching the Crimson in February, she will have an eye on her former skaters as they shoot for Olympic gold.
And as the quintet takes the ice in Vancouver, its Harvard roots won’t be far from the women’s minds.
“We represent—we try to do our best and bring the values we learned from Coach Stone—the importance of working hard and all the things that she taught us while we were at Harvard, and bringing that to the national team,” Ruggiero says.
“Harvard hockey, every time I talk about it or get a chance to brag about it to my teammates on the national team who played for other colleges, I think it’s very clear to them and to anyone who knows me what a special place Harvard hockey has in my heart,” Chu adds. “[I like to] let Coach Stone and let all the other players know what a great tradition they’ve created, and a great foundation for all of us to keep wanting to come back to.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just outside of Minneapolis, in the small town of Wayzata, Minn., a midnight freeze followed an unseasonably warm winter day. In the driveway of Edmund and Harriett Chute, a natural ice rink formed. Their daughters, Katharine and Margaret, moved nets down to the ice and began playing hockey.
“You read about Gretzky and how he just loved hockey,” says The Blake School coach Brano Stankovsky. “The same goes with Katharine and Margaret.”
After playing three years side by side at Blake, Katharine and Margaret Chute—now a junior and freshman at Harvard, respectively—are reunited, skating for the Crimson in the cozy confines of Bright Hockey Center.
Each sister brings something different to the ice, and both will prove invaluable for a Harvard squad with a small roster—the Crimson will manage only three offensive lines this year.
“Katharine does everything at hyper-speed,” Stankovsky says. “She tries to be excellent at what she does...She’s very gentle as a person everywhere else except on the ice—she’s a fire plug.”
“Margaret has a more cerebral quality to her,” he adds. “She thinks things through.”
Despite disparate approaches to the game, the Chutes complement each other well.
“They learned where each other would be, so they could make some really exciting plays,” their father Edmund Chute says of his daughters’ high school days. “I think the most interesting part of that was when they were on penalty kill. Sometimes there’d be just the two of them, and I think the coach told me once that when they were a woman down, they often scored more often.”
“We’ve watched each other play for years, so it’s really nice to be on the ice and know where Margaret’s going to be,” Katharine adds.
So far, Harvard coach Katey Stone has Katharine and Margaret matched up on the same forward line, flanking senior Anna McDonald. How the sisters’ dynamic translates onto the ice for the Crimson remains to be seen, but Stone is optimistic that the pairing will bring good results.
“I know that they’re both happy to be going to school together,” Stone says, “and how that shakes out as far as what it looks like for our team, it’s way too early. Hopefully it’s going to be a real positive for our team.”
“I think that’s going to be a really exciting line that I really want to see,” Edmund says, having followed McDonald, also from the Minneapolis area, since before Harvard. “I think that combination is really exciting.”
But playing on the same line is no new feeling for the Chute sisters. During Katharine’s senior year at Blake—Margaret’s sophomore year—they played together, leading their team to a state finals victory. Margaret repeated the feat her senior year, when she captained the team, and Katharine won her first state title when she was in eighth grade playing for the Blake varsity squad.
“That much poise as an eighth grader is something you don’t find,” Stankovsky says.
For their part, the Chutes are just happy to be together again.
“It’s really nice to have my older sister on the same line because she can offer constructive criticism,” Margaret says. “A lot of freshmen come in not knowing anyone, and I had a built-in network...It’s interesting because I’ve played with my sister and [freshman] Hilary [Hayssen] and a lot of Minnesotan girls, but now that we’re a part of this team, everyone has different roles, and it’s an entirely different team.”
The Crimson will benefit from having seven skaters from Minnesota, a state that, according to Margaret, has good enough competition at the high-school level that she and Katharine never had to double up with a club team.
But the familiar faces extend beyond Harvard for the Chutes, as many of Katharine and Margaret’s former teammates are now playing for rival collegiate teams. According to Edmund Chute, Dartmouth’s Sally Komarek was on the same line with his daughters on the state championship team.
With the 2009-10 regular season kicking off tonight for Harvard, the Chute sisters will be ready to do what they love: play the sport they’ve played since before they can remember—together.
“We grew up with hockey and skating outside, so it’s really been a big part of our lives,” Katharine says.
While they may be playing against former teammates and with former opponents, at least they’ve got each other. And according to Stankovsky, having both Chutes is a recipe for greatness.
“That’s the magic that the two of them bring,” Stankovsky says. “Katharine is just like a racing rabbit out there—she’s quick. The neat part is Margaret will let her go do that, get herself open, and they see each other, find each other. It’s uncanny. A lot of times they don’t talk to each other, it just happens.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Growing up in snowy Montreal, Alex, Michael, and Danny Biega were immersed from birth in a world obsessed with hockey.
“It was a very competitive atmosphere and we took hockey very seriously living in Montreal, which is a very hockey-specific and hockey-oriented town,” freshman Danny says.
The competitive atmosphere of Montreal infiltrated the Biega family environment. The four brothers—the youngest, Marc, will graduate from high school in 2011—played games of two-on-two hockey growing up, with Alex teaming up with Marc to take on Michael and Danny. The games more than often ended up in fistfights.
But there won’t be any fighting between the brothers in the near future. With Danny’s arrival on campus this year, the Biegas will all be on the same side for the first time, as the three look to help the Crimson challenge for an ECAC and Ivy League title.
“Michael and I have played on the same teams for most of our lives,” Alex says. “I’ve never had the chance to play with Danny, just because of the age difference, but we’re really looking forward to it. It’s something very special and unique for a family and I really have to take a step back sometimes and really think it through and appreciate the opportunity and everything that has happened so far.”
The Biega brothers’ path to Harvard started five years ago. Leading the way as a highly-sought-after prep school hockey player, Alex knew that there was only one school he wanted to play for in college.
“It was kind of set in stone that I wanted to go to Harvard, and I just jumped on the opportunity and tried to do whatever I could to get to this place,” Alex says.
His decision to join the Crimson has worked out well. Now a senior and captain of the team, the defenseman led the squad with 16 assists last season and has garnered numerous awards, including last year’s John Tudor Memorial Cup as Harvard’s most valuable player.
In addition to his stellar play for the Crimson, Alex has played an important role in attracting both his brothers to the program.
Michael, currently a junior, played a key role on Harvard’s offense last year, scoring six goals and handing out 11 assists. Michael had a tremendous start to his college career in the Crimson’s 2008-09 campaign, when he was the only freshman and one of only nine Harvard players to skate in every game.
But before deciding on the Crimson, Michael entertained offers from colleges around the country, including cross-town rival Boston College.
“[Harvard] was definitely my number-one choice, and it really helped that Alex was here telling me how much fun he was having and how much of a good time this place is,” Michael says.
Alex’s experience with the Harvard program had a similar effect on Danny, as the younger brother quickly made up his mind on his top destination for college.
“Obviously, when my first brother got accepted here, I knew right away that I definitely wanted to follow his footsteps and do what he was doing,” Danny says.
Despite the competitive nature and physical style of play that the three brothers share, the Biegas have more differences than similarities when they’re on the ice.
“They’re actually very different from each other,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 says. “Alex has great foot speed, and is very clever with the puck, and is flashy, very good on both ends of the ice, really is very noticeable to the common observer. Michael is not as fleet of foot, great set of hands, great puck skills, goal scorer’s shot and touch. Danny, so far as we can see, is just beyond his years in his poise and composure out there.”
Similarities and differences in playing styles aside, the Biegas will figure prominently in any success the Crimson reaps this season.  And the three couldn’t be more excited for the start of what looks to be a competitive season.
“There’s going to be some fights, definitely,” Danny says.  “The competitive atmosphere’s going to be back.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Like many students on campus, the Harvard sailing team is realizing just how quickly the end of the semester is approaching with this year’s new calendar system in place. However, just as yesterday’s clear skies and warm weather provided students with a respite before winter weather and finals season, the Crimson competed in its one and only weekend of fall team racing before next weekend’s fleet-style Atlantic Coast Championships.
The team race format provided Harvard sailors with a preview of what is to come during the spring season and added some confidence heading into next weekend’s fleet championship regattas.
The Crimson’s women’s team claimed its first team victory of the year, winning the Michael Horn Trophy Team Race. A Harvard co-ed contingent did not fare quite as well but still found success at the Hap Moore Team Race, finishing sixth against stingy competition.
“This was our first team race of the season and we made some mistakes,” senior Michelle Konstadt said. “But this weekend also showed us we have a lot of potential and room to improve during the spring season in the team race format.”
HORN TROPHY TEAM RACE
The Horn Trophy Team Race provided the women’s squad with the rare opportunity to sail in a team race format, as at least two skippers had to be women in this regatta. The Crimson, who hosted the event, edged out Vermont on Sunday to claim the team title.
“It was great being at Harvard to take part in a unique style of racing for the women’s team,” sophomore Alex Jumper said. “We had to deal with the typical Charles conditions, which were very shifty winds and big wind velocity changes.”
The victorious Crimson squad consisted of captain Liz Powers skippering the first boat, with senior Marie Appel taking care of the crewing duties. Jumper, who was the crew for the second boat, accompanied sophomore skipper Emily Lambert. The final Harvard pairing was junior skipper Colin Santangelo and freshman crew Sarah McCuskee.
“We had to play with and capitalize on the breeze conditions in order to succeed,” Jumper said.
While the Crimson’s success this past weekend is a good sign of things to come during the spring season, next weekend’s championship fleet racing will still prove to be quite a challenge, as the Harvard women travel to Brown to compete among the best teams on the east coast.
“Sailing at Brown is typically pretty breezy with more open water conditions,” Jumper said. “We are excited to compete next weekend, as that regatta will be the culmination of all of our racing so far this season.”
HAP MOORE TEAM RACE
The co-ed squad traveled a bit farther than its female counterpart, as Harvard competed at the Hap Moore Trophy hosted by Boston College and brought home a sixth place team finish.
The Crimson lineup included skippers junior captain Alan Palmer, junior Teddy Himler, and sophomore Brendan Kopp. Junior Grace Charles, sophomore Annie DeAngelo, and Konstadt took care of the crewing duties in the team race style of racing, which will be contested much more frequently in the spring.
“We will study in classroom sessions over the winter to prepare for team racing in the spring,” Konstadt said. “So hopefully we will be able to improve by then. Our coach is great at teaching us different team racing situations, so I think we will be more prepared come the spring.”
While this weekend of team racing did provide a glimpse of what is to come in a few months, the co-ed squad’s thoughts remain on next weekend’s big race and finishing up its fall campaign on a high note.
“We will be competing at Harvard next weekend in conditions that we are used to,” Konstadt said. “So it will pretty much be the best [Atlantic Coast Championships] that we could ask for.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a season of handing out assists to her teammates, it was time for sophomore Melanie Baskind to get some goals of her own.
And for the Harvard women’s soccer team, Baskind’s scoring display could not have come at a more crucial moment.
Baskind’s two goals in the Crimson’s final match of the regular season propelled Harvard over Columbia in overtime, 2-1, and earned the defending Ivy League champions an outright Ancient Eight title for the first time this decade.
“It was just the kind of game we needed in a big time pressure experience,” Crimson coach Ray Leone said. “[Baskind] was focused. She was sharp with her touches.”
After the Lions sent the game into overtime with a last-second score, Harvard would need a way to regain its edge. Enter Baskind.
“When the pressure’s on, she wants the ball,” Leone said.
Six minutes into the first overtime, junior forward Katherine Sheeleigh, the Crimson’s leading scorer, dished the ball to Baskind on the left side of the field. The forward dribbled ahead and fired from eight yards out past the Columbia goalie for the game winner.
“She pulled through with a few amazing goals,” co-captain Lizzy Nichols said. “She…is one of those players who can bring that extra spark to the game that we need sometimes.”
Baskind’s first tally of the game came just 10 minutes in. Last year’s Ivy Rookie of the Year wouldn’t need any help, as she dribbled past Lion defenders from 18 yards out before whipping the ball into the right side of the net to give Harvard the 1-0 lead.
And up until the match’s final seconds, the single goal appeared to be all the Crimson would need.
But with the visitors just 15 seconds from celebration, Columbia’s Lauren Cooke headed the ball past Crimson senior goalkeeper Lauren Mann off a free kick to even the score in the 90th minute.
Baskind wasn’t surprised.
“It was almost just like ‘of course that would happen,’” she said. “When [Columbia scored] it was just kind of like, ‘I shouldn’t be surprised right now,’ because of the way things have been going this season.”
But Baskind and the rest of the Harvard team responded well to the new challenge. The overtime golden goal was the only shot the Crimson needed in the extra session to return from New York with a trophy all for itself.
Harvard had clinched a share of the Ivy League title the prior weekend with its victory over Dartmouth, but it came to Columbia hungry for an outright title after sharing last season’s championship with Princeton.
“It just kind of speaks to the character of our team. I think it would have been easy for a lot of teams [to come out unfocused],” Baskind said. “We’re not happy with [sharing the title].”
In Baskind, the Crimson soccer team has found a player with the ability to keep the team grounded in crucial situations.
After the squad opened the season with two early non-conference losses, it was Baskind who encouraged the team to get back on the right track before its match against Hofstra.
“I remember she just looked at the team and said, ‘This wasn’t good enough. I’m tired of building. We need to start performing,’” Nichols said. “She brought her passion to that game and I was really proud of her.”
On top of her leadership, Baskind has aided Harvard with her ability to kick the Crimson offense into gear. Since her arrival in Cambridge last year, the Framingham, Mass. native has done a remarkable job getting her teammates involved—recording 13 assists over two seasons.
Her freshman totals of six goals and seven assists were good enough to earn Baskind the honor of the league’s top newcomer and a spot on the Second Team All-Ivy. Baskind has continued to set her teammates up this season, leading the team with six assists.
But in a reversal of roles, it was Baskind who got the glory in Harvard’s final matchup by notching her third and fourth goals of the year.
“She deserved it,” Nichols said. “She has definitely created a bunch of opportunities for other players [but she took control].”
With a slew of personal accolades and two Ivy League championships under her belt, Baskind has already had quite a career in the Crimson women’s soccer program. But the sophomore still has two seasons to build on her personal and team accomplishments.
“I’m really proud of how she hasn’t accepted just being good at one or two things,” Leone said. “She can be as good as she wants to.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This is the second part in a series of columns analyzing the current climate of college soccer—its role in the development of the sport in America, its drawbacks and limitations, and the future of the game amidst a growing trend towards youth professional development.
Part 2: Where has college soccer gone wrong, and how do we fix it?
As the autumn season slowly withers into the colder and harsher climes of early winter, so too does the men’s collegiate soccer season descend into weeks of bitter competition across the nation.
Over the next few weeks, teams will be  competing in conference tournaments, hoping to earn invitations for postseason action. The Ivy League enters its final weekend of regular season play with much still at stake—championship aspirations for Harvard, at-large NCAA berths to claim for others.
While the next month of games will undoubtedly feature a multitude of individual accomplishments and team achievements (culminating in the 2009 NCAA College Cup on Dec. 11), many soccer supporters will be unsatisfied yet again by the conclusion of another collegiate campaign.
Many will be dissatisfied, you see, because the collegiate version of soccer is inherently flawed. With its confounding interpretations of the “Laws of the Game”, its oft-dissonant attitude with the professional game, and frequent listless play, college soccer has rightfully been accused by many critics as a bastardization of the beautiful game played the world over.
It has also, however, wrongly been utilized as a scapegoat for all the woes of American soccer development. College soccer is neither a productive cog in the American soccer pyramid nor an antiquated system as its detractors often demonize it to be.
With a few corrections (some common-sensical) and a renewed realization of what college soccer should be, the collegiate version of the sport can rightfully assume its place alongside youth club development and Major League Soccer (MLS) player academies as a viable alternative for individuals looking to better their sporting, and more importantly, intellectual talents.
Who’s rules are these?
Here’s the scenario: A soccer aficionado is visiting the USA and is taking in his first game of collegiate soccer. The unassuming visitor is excited by the athletic talent on display and the fervent collection of frat boys on the sideline. The home coach prepares to make his substitutions, bringing two players off the field. The home team is tied and our visitor is eager to see what the new players will bring to the field. But wait, weren’t these two bench players on the field just minutes ago? He glances at the clock—why is it counting down? And why does no one seem nervous that the game is still tied with two minutes to go?
This fictitious visitor is aghast because the NCAA, in all its wisdom, has decided that the laws FIFA has cultivated for years have been deemed inadequate by college soccer’s governing body. With its unlimited substitutions, running clock, and short season amongst other things, the NCAA has effectively watered down the game and harmed the development of its top soccer prospects.
While I won’t get into a discussion as to what style of attacking soccer works best, it cannot be argued that the rules currently set in place have significantly diluted the play on the field. Unlimited substitutions have enabled coaches to throw in wave after wave of players for short spells to disrupt the opposition. Instead of carefully building up an attack through efficient passing, players often deploy “punt and sprint” strategies, electing to launch the ball downfield and sprint towards it, knowing full well that a sub on the bench will gladly reprieve them for a few minutes.
The short season and restraints placed on coaches also hamper the development of these student-athletes, and adversely affect their academic responsibilities—two things the NCAA is supposedly mandated to protect. Coaches are only allowed to train their players for 20 hourseach week during the 132 day soccer season. The season, running from September through December, ensures two things: games towards the end of the season will frequently be played under inhospitable conditions and players will have often play as many as three games in 7-8 day stretches, significantly detracting from their responsibilities in the classroom. College soccer players are asked to do yeomen’s work for one semester and then have no structured form of training the next. Contrasted with the development structures abroad, where amateur soccer players are trained year-round, USA collegiate soccer pales in comparison.
And I haven’t even mentioned the inanity of hearing an announcer count down the seconds of the game. Or the fact that many schools who boast their soccer program as the most successful squad on campus still fail to attract fans to the stands (the NCAA offers no assistance with its lack of advertisement either).
Surely, there must be a way.
Despite the bevy of flaws, college soccer can still be fixed.While I remain convinced that America’s future soccer stars will increasingly choose to eschew college soccer and develop under the auspices of youth development programs in clubs abroad and in MLS, I don’t believe college soccer has to be resigned to its current fate of inevitable irrelevance. Correcting just a few of the flaws described above will do wonders for the collegiate game.
The first fix is to cut down on unlimited substitutions. College soccer players are phenomenal athletes, and many, if not all, have the stamina to play 90 minutes. Because college soccer should encourage as much participation as possible, I do think the NCAA would be wise to increase the number of substitutions from the traditional three of professional soccer to five or six. This would deter coaches from resorting to long-ball tactics and possibly allow the introduction of a more free-flowing style of play. Eliminating extra time during the regular season and moving to traditional timekeeping would do wonders, as well.
More importantly however, the NCAA needs to return to its intended purpose of providing opportunities for its student-athletes.
Twice this season, Harvard has had to play three games in eight days. Splitting the season into two halves, fall and spring, would allow more time for coaches to train players. It would also allow players to devote more attention to their studies, spending more time in the classroom during the week than travelling to games.  Cross country and track allow for it; soccer should as well.
Despite my grievances, genuine changes do appear to be on the horizon. ESPN recently reported that the NCAA is considering a proposal to allow schools to recruit athletes who have played with professional athletes but maintained their amateur status by not receiving a salary.
If passed, this would allow college soccer players (and prospective youth players) the opportunity to fully participate in professional player academies like the ones being developed across several Major League Soccer clubs.
Despite the NCAA’s increased communication with professional leagues like the NBA and NFL, the interaction with MLS has been abhorrent (probably because the NCAA doesn’t stand to gain the millions it does through football and basketball).
I’m not arguing that college soccer should be viewed as a means towards developing professional athletes.I explicitly rejected that in my previous column on this topic. I do find it peculiar however, that Division I soccer coaches are afforded less than 10 scholarships for squads typically comprised of 25 or more players, when D-1 football coaches receive scholarships for nearly 85% of their players.
The Ivy League, of course, does not offer any athletic scholarships but generous financial aid grants allow players to attend anyway.
Offering more scholarships and providing more training time for players (and competitive play through the aforementioned rule changes) will allow teams to field better teams, even if, as expected, the absolute best youth talent forego college altogether to start professional careers in MLS or abroad.
Unlike nearly everywhere else in the world, young soccer players in this country have the incredible opportunity to simultaneously pursue their athletic and academic dreams.
Young players from Latin America and Europe often have to sacrifice academic endeavors to compete for the chance at a professional contract. The majority of collegiate soccer players, as the NCAA likes to remind us in its adverts, will turn “pro” in something other than soccer. Unfortunately, those soccer players who do have the talent to turn pro are getting short changed by NCAA’s inept conception of soccer. Similarly, those players who play the sport knowing full well that their future lies not on the pitch but in the workforce have to sacrifice immensely during the season to participate in games that are sparsely attended and rarely entertaining.
I’m certainly not the first to voice these complaints, but I sincerely hope that I am one of the last. One can only hope that the NCAA realizes the errors of its ways and commits to bettering collegiate soccer; simple rule changes and increased communication with MLS can ensure that.
Better referees wouldn’t hurt either. But I digress.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It took a long and arduous journey for the Harvard women’s soccer team to make it into the NCAA tournament, but the squad won’t have to go far to play its first round match.
The Crimson will travel to Newton, Mass., Friday evening to take on regional No. 2 seed Boston College—the number seven team in the nation. Scheduled for either 4 p.m. or 7 p.m., the game time has not yet been specified.
The two local rivals have tussled once already this season, as Harvard fell to the Eagles—ranked fourth in the nation at the time—in mid-September.
The 4-1 road loss dropped Harvard to a 1-4-1 record, despite the Crimson scoring the first goal allowed by Boston College in its first seven games.
After turning its season around in a major way, Harvard enters Friday’s match having won eight of its last nine games.
The winner of the contest will take on the victor of UConn and BU, two teams that the Crimson took on this fall. The second-round game will also be held at Boston College.
Harvard lost at the same location last year—not to Boston College but instead to Northeastern.
Last year, the Crimson lost an overtime thriller to the Huskies in penalty kicks, an ending that involved a devastating penalty call against goaltender Lauren Mann.
