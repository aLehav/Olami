“Everything Happens as It Does,” by Bulgarian writer Albena Stambolova, is a slip of a novel that chronicles the ways in which the lives of seven characters intersect and impact one another. Very little occurs in the way of concrete plot, but the text announces its sticking point in its title: everything that happens is fated to happen. Stambolova proves herself capable of masterful prose, and she puts forth an assemblage of compelling characters whose strangeness arrests the reader from the outset. But ultimately, the fatalist theme of the novel is its undoing. Characters who prove to be static, coupled with a tone that is simply too emotionally detached to be engaging, prevent “Everything Happens as It Does” from living up to its author’s talents.
The novel gets off to a fantastic start with introductory vignettes that paint vivid pictures of the men and women whose stories it will trace. Boris is a diffident prodigy who identifies more with bees than with humans. The son of a beekeeper, “[Boris] knew from the very beginning that honey belonged to the bees, and his father rattling the drawers now seemed silly.” On the day of his baptism, he is “overcome by panic at the prospect of this mystery in which he was to become the main protagonist.” Maria, whom Boris eventually weds, is similarly intriguing. A modern-day succubus, she is knowable only through the effect she has on the husbands and children she chews up and spits out. Stambolova writes of her first husband, “Before meeting Maria, he had been simply Philip, a doctor, a pathologist. He had been able to describe himself in a word. After meeting Maria, his center of gravity was transposed out of his body, and in the beginning this gave him strength. Strength that Maria absorbed.” Maria and Philip’s twin children Valentin and Margarita are also compelling. Physically they appear almost identical, but they are profoundly dissimilar beneath the surface. Margarita, like Boris, declines to engage with the world around her. There is a wonderful, haunting passage where Valentin tries in vain to bring his sister down to earth; all the while, she is imagining that she is a spider. Stambolova writes, “Valentin would be…furiously shaking what he believed to be Margarita, and she would be swinging on the filaments up here, laughing.”
The novel also benefits from Stambolova’s knack for distilling complicated ideas into pithy, heartbreaking passages. When Valentin reflects on his relationship with his estranged daughter, the result is stunning: “His daughter’s age, the years, like the beginnings of a bridge extending from one side of the river, but with no support, like a floating arch over the water, and every Christmas he was adding to it. But what was he adding? Length? He was just making it more fragile.” Boris’s take on domesticity is similarly wrenching: “What human beings considered rational was miles away from the living economy of bees. Between the act of pressing the washing machine button and the mood of the person pressing it there was an entire universe of folly that people called their lives.”
The magnetism of Stambolova’s characterizations and prose cannot be gainsaid. Unfortunately, the substance that sucks the reader in proves to be literary quicksand. Stambolova’s vivid introductions to her characters set in the reader high expectations for their growth over the course of the novel. But it is remarkable how little Stambolova’s creations develop. The characters rely on the currents of fate to float them where they’re meant to wash up; powerlessness to alter their paths seems to have been transmuted into a powerlessness to change themselves. Boris, Maria, Margarita, Valentin, and the other main characters are fascinating, but in the same exact ways from beginning to end. Boris is as bee-loving and reclusive on the story’s final page as on the first. The dichotomy between Margarita and Valentin is unchallenged. Maria remains absolutely inscrutable. A cast of characters to whom agency is anathema might have been tolerable, if they developed internally as they plodded toward foregone conclusions. But the lack of payoff makes the novel itself feel useless.
The efficacy of “Everything Happens as It Does” is further undermined by the detached, abstract tone Stambolova frequently adopts. Her prose is gorgeous, but like so many of her characters, exists on a plane utterly divorced from reality. The novel opens as follows: “This story considers itself the story of everyone. I don’t know if this is true. You will be the one to decide. This story is neither funny, nor sad. It is simply a story that takes place somewhere on the border between the world we know and the world we are no longer very sure about.” A few paragraphs in this vein would have been intriguing; in abundance, they become oppressive. Wading through “Everything Happens as It Does” is akin to trudging through the aforementioned quicksand with a curtain over one’s face. What little resolution Stambolova doles out at the conclusion of the novel does indeed feel inevitable. But its elegance is undermined by the lethargy into which the reader has been sunk by the text’s refusal to occasionally touch down in recognizable, realistic description.
“Everything Happens as It Does” frustrates more than it entertains, and perplexes more than it illuminates. Keep an eye out for future efforts by Stambolova, but for the time being a rain check is advised.

When many people speak of or hear about K-Pop, men in flamboyant suits while horse dancing or groups of nine girls in matching outfits, makeup, and choreography may come to mind. The industry has capitalized on and successfully sold a flashy, visual medium, garnering the intrigue of fans across several continents. Over the course of the past 15 years, early K-Pop fans have witnessed the evolution of the genre, and the first few artists to foray into this new pop genre in South Korea—H.O.T, S.E.S., Shinhwa, g.o.d. to name a few—are now respected as members of an "Old School" K-Pop movement. As the second generation of K-Pop artists hit their mid-20s, they already seem much older than the the majority of artists with whom they compete for spots on the music charts, and are referred to as "sunbae" (older colleague) artists. Some of the newest debuting groups now even have members as young as 13 years old. It is an interesting time for K-Pop, and as the industry gears up to usher in a third generation of artists, it is worth reexamining how the industry has reached its current powerful status, for it is impossible to fully understand how K-Pop has come so far without a quick flashback to history.
In the 1980s, President Chun Doo-hwan successfully led a military coup of the nation, quickly putting down the democratization movements in South Korea. To distract the public from his political corruption, he put forth his infamous "3S" policy: "Sex, Sports, and Screen." With the enactment of this policy came the birth of a professional baseball league in South Korea and the creation of explicit films as sources of entertainment for the public. Films with any potential political messages were censored, but nudity was condoned, perhaps even encouraged, to distract audiences with a falsified sense of freedom, as the government took away this very freedom from its people.
In June of 1987, the nation rallied together in mass protests from June 10 to June 29 in what would become known as the "June Uprising." Demonstrators forced the ruling government to hold elections and put into policy democratic reform, thus establishing the Sixth Republic of the South Korea. This forced President Chun out of power and ushered in the return to democracy in the nation.This monumental moment in South Korea history was quickly followed with the 1988 Olympic Games held in Seoul, thus placing Korea on the map for the rest of the world to see. Since 1987, the nation has experienced incredible transformation, causing economists to ponder what could explain the exponential growth and comeback of the nation following the devastation of war only half a century ago.
The explosion of the Korean Wave (Hallyu) and the widespread power of K-Pop paint the image of a nation with a transnational vision and a constant desire to globalize; but for a nation that remembers the 3S Policy’s suffocation of artistic expression, the Korean Wave and the growth of the K-Pop industry also serves to bring the Korean people a collective voice and identity worldwide. As filmmakers, actors, musicians, and now even K-Pop artists hone their craft, their works serve not only to tell outsiders about their stories and to spark an interest in Korea among other nations, but also to allow the Korean people to take agency and ownership of their identity as a nation of liberated individuals on a global stage.
Perhaps those unaware of Korea’s history will listen to K-Pop and bob their hands along to the exciting beats or find intrigue in the foreign language lyrics or highly stylized clothing and choreography, but the music is not to be mistaken for an imitation or spin-off of American pop music. The light, playful, and youth-driven music is more than the glitz and glam of a multi-billion-dollar industry, more than a genre that has gained international fame and hyperactive fan bases. It is a genre that serves to give the people of Korea a voice on the global stage.

It’s pretty common to hear about pop stars being "created." The story goes like so: acts like One Direction have their look, aura, and sound constructed for them.
This could be true or untrue about Britain’s Biggest Boy Band, but it’s definitely true about Holly Laessig and Jess Wolfe of the band Lucius. With one major caveat, that is: Laessig and Wolfe create themselves. They’ve created a musical and visual idea for their band and have become possessed by it, carefully molding every show, interview, and record around that idea.
It’s pretty simple: two women as one. Laessig and Wolfe compose and arrange songs together, sing lead vocal together, dress together, and make appearances together. Together, they are the "Wildewoman" for which their 2013 debut album is named. It is this "twinning" and sisterly bond that led the group out of Boston and onto the Brooklyn indie scene six years ago and that has spurred the band’s budding stardom this year.
When Laessig and Wolfe emerge on the stage of Boston Calling in September, it’s impossible to tell them apart. They have the same haircut: full, blonde bangs that sweep into the dark sunglasses they sport. They each wear a black and white dress that’s an inversion of the other’s. They face each other, each playing a keyboard, and are flanked by the three other instrumentalists of the group so that it seems like there’s a mirror that has cut the stage in half.
The degree to which they match is a little freaky and alarming, but it completely suits the music: retro pop that’s as pristine and shiny as a mirror. There aren’t too many pop songs this year better than “Hey, Doreen,” on which the two singers belting completely in unison over driving guitar and keyboard that complement each other. There’s not a note or snare hit that doesn’t belong, just as there’s not a strand of hair on Laessig’s or Wolfe’s head that isn’t perfectly in place.
This control is all too intentional. "We’re kind of obsessive-compulsive, both of us," Laessig tells me over the phone (I picked up a call with who I was told would be Jess; of course, Holly’s voice came over the line.). "I like to say that we dress the sound more than we dress ourselves. It’s a mirror effect: people are transported to this other world through the symmetry." Laessig then proceeds to outline the symmetry of their whole set: "We’re both singing, and we have two guys drumming. Then it was like, can we do even more in an audio sense? So Jess and Pete Lalish share bass responsibilities. There’s that duality. It’s just, we keep expanding upon it and keep it in mind for everything artistically—for videos, for live, for lights."
It’s hard to believe that Laessig and Wolfe haven’t always been entwined at the hip, but they didn’t meet until their third year at Berklee College of Music in early 2006. At the time, they were studying vocal performance and singing the occasional jazz gig. They met on "one fateful night" at one of Wolfe’s parties, where they bonded over their love for rock and roll, soul music, and of course, the Beatles. "Our first show was going to be a ‘White Album’ cover show," Laessig remembers. "We rearranged ‘Happiness is a Warm Gun,’ but we never did the show. We just started doing our own thing." The pair then teamed up with three other Berklee musicians in New York to form the whole band.
It’s far too easy to compare current rock and pop groups to the Beatles, but Lucius carry on the two-frontman tradition that hasn’t been employed very often since the early Lennon-McCartney days. "It was a happy accident," Laessig says. "We were both singing the melody at one point and it sounded a doubled vocal, like on ‘Elliott Smith’ or so many other records. We have such different voices, but when we sang together, it was this weird third entity."
Laessig and Wolfe have fully embraced this "third entity" that seems to be far bigger than either one of them alone. Their upbeat album "Wildewoman" has earned praise from NPR and Rolling Stone, and they’re currently on their first-ever European tour. "We’re freaking out," Laessig tells me right before their flight.
This is one of the few moments in which Laessig isn’t fully composed. The rest of the time, in interviews and during shows, the two Berklee musicians are ridiculously poised, so much so it’s easy to think Lucius might have been thought up by some industry whiz. But they weren’t—the composure, the songwriting, the vocals, and the style are all the hard work of Lucius themselves.
Note: try and catch Lucius at the Sinclair on December 5.

As Americans spend more and more time plugged in, many have worried about technology’s effects on human interaction and social capability. What most have applauded, however, is the creation and spread of tools to new groups who have never had access to them. Many of these tools are useful for creating and spreading art. Instagram allows people to share pictures, museum websites allow remote populations experience these institutions’ art, and YouTube gives anyone with a computer free access to everything from Ravel's String Quartet to Destiny Child’s Bootylicious. It seems that the obvious result of this process would be an irrepressible explosion in the quantity and types of artistic expression, on new mediums and with different people. The process has not been so simple. Instead, technology’s influx of possibilities has turned our gaze inward while nominally looking outward.
"Selfies" and social media only serve to reinforce this trend. Though social media help us connect with friends and colleagues, the ulterior motive is to put the spotlight on the self. The new “Shots of Me” is an app that focuses only on selfies (pictures of yourself that are meant to be shared), the ultimate exercise in narcissism. Programs like Photoshop allow for virtual perfection that can be shared, and Photoshop’s younger (very successful) cousin Instagram is a social offshoot of the idea. However, more traditional social media are also narcissistic: Twitter gives us the tools to speak our thoughts to the world at large, and Facebook is literally a collection of facts, photos, and thoughts about ourselves, describing its new timeline as a tool to “tell your life story with a new kind of profile.”
Narcissism is not the only downside to this sharing, as the social media generation has begun to discover—people are not always honest on the Internet. Though these frauds include the usual collection of identity thieves, predators, and other unsavory characters, not everyone is of their ilk; the category now also includes people like you and me, lying because they want to look better. Selfies can be edited, Facebook accounts can be falsified, and one couldsound smart on Twitter by writing a post with a dictionary in hand.
Projecting a perfect self goes beyond technologies that focus the spotlight on one’s self. A well-rounded internet presence must include curation. The original curator blogging service Tumblr has inspired the Pinterests of the world. It encourages curation of pictures from around the web in a manner similar to old-school fashion blogs, formatted with collections (or "boards") of pictures and short descriptions that act as inspiration for the perfect wedding, the perfect outfit, or the perfect life.
Visual sites may lend themselves to curation, but SoundCloud has extended the concept. SoundCloud originally existed as a place for people to share the music they created, but it also encourages its users to share music. Though creators are respected, someone with a well-curated sense of musical style looks "better" in the eyes of his internet friends. Spotify operates on a similar sharing platform, as the original program encourages users to share what they were listening to.
In addition to the obvious, more artsy technologies, social media have extended to the realm of education. With services like Duolingo, millions of people who had not previously been able to afford language lessons or software now have access to an effective program for learning new languages, including English as a second language. Suddenly, self-improvement is possible, easy, and encouraged. Duolingo also acts as a social media site—friends can connect with you and track your progress. Doing well is showing off.
In an ironic twist, the vast improvements we have seen in technology allowing us to connect with each other have caused us to focus an inordinate amount of our attention inward. With social media, the world is our mirror, and we all want to know: who is the fairest (and smartest, and funniest, and nicest) of them all?

Welcome to the Barrio Vega. Welcome to Santiago’s famous neighborhood where merchants sell pisco and pirated books by the roadside, where men cook chicken by the fire in an empty oil drum. Welcome to this place in Chile’s capital city where the mercado offers swordfish and spiny fruits and shiny, smiling, silent swine. On your way home from work in the Barrio Vega you might stop and buy a fried snack from a vendor while walking to the bus stop. You might start eating and soon feel a prickling in your nose, an inflammation in your eyes, an urgent pain in your throat. You’ll be startled, of course, but before noticing that everyone around you is covering their face with a kerchief, before spying discarded protest signage on the ground, before recalling that the police suppressed a student insurrection with tear gas earlier in the day, all you can seem to ask is, "What on earth is wrong with this churro?"
In such fashion I spent the summer before sophomore year in South America. On the bus back from work most evenings I spent some time with a little red notebook and a tourist edition of Neruda’s earliest collection of poems, "Crepusculario." I had the fantastic idea to translate the collection into English and bring new eyes to the verses that were (swiftly and justifiably) dwarfed by his second volume, "Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair" ("Veinte Poemas de Amor y una Cancion Desesperada"). The first poem of his first collection, appropriately titled “Inicial,” opens with the image of a farmer laboring silently, anxiously, diligently, over an empty garden. Nine lines. Fourteen syllables each. Paroxytone verse. But I couldn’t translate it. Every compromise of meter or meaning was unacceptable. The enterprise seemed criminal. So much for the summer project.
I’ve come a little way since then. I realize that you’ll get nowhere if you’re afraid of messing up or making a mess. You miss one hundred percent of the shots you don’t take. You must break a few eggs to make an omelet. You must sacrifice the perfect beauty of an orange to buy fresh juice from a vendor in the Barrio Vega. The Spanish writer Miguel de Unamuno memorably starts his novel "Niebla" with the observation that a closed umbrella is as elegant as an open umbrella is ugly. But a closed umbrella is no use at all when it’s raining.
So let’s make like Joyce’s young artist and sally forth to create something ugly or extraordinary. Let’s ignore our conventions and pick up the old Creationist Manifesto of the vanguard Chilean poet Vicente Huidobro when he declared “non serviam” nearly one hundred years ago. Let’s abandon our bubble to invent wicked new postures; let’s take to the streets with a leaping and tumbling, a hootin’ and hollerin’. Stretch your legs and embrace every awful gait between your House and the Yard: walking, racing, shuffling, swaggering, staggering. Limping. Falling down. Getting back up.
There’s no poverty of minor adventures for us at school. Making eye contact with a cop while you jaywalk in front of the Holyoke Center, registering another small victory for the People’s Republic of Cambridge. Going to the famous Falafel Corner by Brattle Square to eat the shavings from a shiny irregular pillar of lamb meat; a shawarma shaped like calculus; a solid of revolution. Or a frightfully cold evening in January, getting lost on the way back from a bat mitzvah in Wellesley: sighing in defeat and calling a cab, saying to yourself, "I’m so glad I have ways and means, and options, and shelter."
In Neruda’s “Walking Around,” the speakers declares that he is tired—of being a man, of his hair, of his nails and his shadow and his feet. Well, I’m not tired; if anything, my feet and my shoes are tired of me. I beat the hell out of my sneakers every day. I stomp and pirouette and tramp about till the rubber heaves a cry of exhaustion and leaps away from its man. I wear them through the mud and the crushed red velvet cake of Harvard’s 375th birthday party along with 10,000 other happy feet, tearing up the turf in Tercentenary Theater.
For this reason I will take my dog outside and let him brush gently with the minor perils of the world. If he might prick his nose on a cactus then I won’t stop him—how else should he learn? Augusto Perez, the protagonist of "Niebla," likewise instructs his pet: "Did you ever think about this, Orfeo? No, because you’re still too young and you haven’t experienced life. And furthermore you are a dog." And as long as I’m being too bold with my translations from Spanish, I’d like to close with the final image of Neruda’s "Inicial." The speaker, the farmer, can no longer keep his mouth shut. He finally shares his meager flowers with the reader, declaring that even if they’re not fragrant, "they are the first roses—walking brother—of my disconsolate, adolescent garden."

With 12 years under their belt, one might expect noise band Magik Markers to have come a long way from its humble beginnings in a basement in Hartford, Conn. After breaking out of the underground scene when they opened for Sonic Youth’s 2004 tour, they released their first album "I Trust My Guitar, Etc..." on vinyl. While the group has become technologically more mainstream, releasing over 25 CDs and MP3s, Magik Markers’ music has stayed disappointingly close to its roots. In its most recent release, "Surrender to the Fantasy," the experimental rock band regresses to its garage beginnings—instead of showing progress from the early days, "Surrender to the Fantasy" gets lost in the dusty discordance of the past.
The opening chords of the album immediately set the feel of "Surrender to the Fantasy." They are dissonant and jarring, yet syncopated and steady. The jumbled pounding of a guitar, bass, and drum kit comes in unrelenting waves, one after another, assaulting ears with its mixture of seconds and sevenths—chords normally used sparingly in musical compositions. While this style is unusual even in its first appearance on opening track "Crebs," it continues to haunt the subsequent songs on "Surrender to the Fantasy." Although songs such as "Acts of Desperation" and "American Sphinx Face" begin more conventionally with the strumming of a guitar or a gentle buzz of reverb, they evolve to adopt the discordance that drowns the musicality in Magik Markers’ signature noise.
Amid the percussive chaos, static, and synthesizers are the quiet, soothing tones of Magik Markers’ vocalist, Elisa Ambrogio. Ambrogio’s melody is often times lost in the confusion of sound backing her calming voice. Her words fall in what always seems to be the wrong place—a half a beat ahead or a second behind the instrumentalists. However this is more likely the fault of the musicians as they all seem to be playing to contrary beats. Nonetheless, there are moments when the storm of ruckus dies down and the beauty of Ambrogio’s light voice is evident. The bridge of "Acts of Desperation" drops the static and leaves Ambrogio’s voice exposed as she sings "These acts of desperation pay," over and over again, lending emotion to each line and giving some structure and meaning to the racket.
Though quiet tracks are rare for a noise band like Magik Markers, they are the only redeeming moments of "Surrender to the Fantasy." "Mirrorless" and "Young" shine among the nine songs, as they offer an escape from the headache-inducing dissonance. Without the heavy drum kit that pounds throughout the majority of the tracks, Magik Markers capture a melancholic, eerie, yet thought-provoking feel. Finally, lyrics are audible and, it turns out, Ambrogio’s writing is rather profound. She whispers "The worst part of being young is thinking nothing, thinking nothing ever comes" on "Young." While the clean tracks "Mirrorless" and "Young" may not be representative of Magik Markers’ purpose as a noise band, it is in these understated songs that their musicality emerges from the chaos.
After working on "Surrender to the Fantasy" on and off for the past four years, Magik Markers achieved their goal of releasing an unconventional album partially recorded back in the basement. In doing so, however, they sacrifice quality for layered synth and aimless chanting. Its few quiet, soothing songs cannot save the album from the black hole of static and conflict created by the chugging guitar riffs and lack of structure of the rest of the album. The influx of cacophony only detracts from Ambrogio’s vocal strength and lyrical prowess. the album’s last song,"WT," perfectly sums up the album: a drum beats slowly, dragging behind as a guitar and synthesizer clash against one another, and even the usually stellar Ambrogio sings lazily and carelessly over the commotion. Perhaps next time, Magik Markers should focus less on making a loud noise and more on making a musical one.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Frustration, anger, and determination boil over at a German lakeside villa as men in Nazi uniforms storm about, sipping fine wine and discussing their solution to “the Jewish problem” in utmost secret. Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of “Conspiracy,” which will run through Nov. 23 at the Loeb Mainstage, retells the events of the Wannsee Conference of 1942, during which Nazi officials and bureaucrats finalized their plans for the Final Solution—the elimination of 11 million Jews from the German sphere of influence. The production’s primary success was the complex portrayal of every individual story and personality, and ultimately the mundane nature with which the characters agreed upon the devastating plan.
Inspired by the only surviving transcript of the 1942 meeting, Loring Mandel originally wrote the screenplay of “Conspiracy” in 1997, and it was turned into an HBO movie in 2001. The film production garnered many Emmy Awards, including one for Mandel’s writing. In 2012, director Caleb J. T. Thompson ’14, a Crimson arts editor reached out to Mandel, eventually adapting his screenplay into this HRDC performance.
The story begins as men walk around the German villa, adorned with lavish paintings and chairs, awkwardly conversing with one another and awaiting their host. With conviction and passion, Reinhard Heydrich (Adam J. Conner ’14, a Crimson business editor) makes his dramatic entrance, stopping the men in their place as they fumble to discard the wine and cheese in their hands. The men greet their leader with the Nazi salute of a “Heil Hitler,” which dramatically echoes throughout the theater halls and lingers about the room.
Toward the end of the play, the men delve into the crux of their task—crafting a final plan to exterminate the Jewish population throughout much of Europe. The conference includes men who differ greatly in their beliefs such as one of the writers of the Nuremberg Laws, the director of the Four Year Plan, important political figures, and German lawyers.
Conner’s performance as Heydrich remains the highlight of the show, with a determined and sincere look present on his face throughout. His role as the meeting’s leader demands a commanding presence, and Conner more than succeeds in bringing Heydrich to life. Conner makes it easy to dispise Heydrich as he constantly reminds the men that genocide is the only answer to Germany’s Jewish population. Another standout is Cole V. Edick ’17 as Wilhelm Stuckart, one of the authors of the Nuremberg Laws, who desperately yells to defend his work.
The authenticity of the show allows the audience to be transported to the tumultuous time in German history and truly experience the intensity of the situation. The flawless acting is complimented well by the technical aspects of the production. Sound design by Mikhaila R. Fogel ’16 is spectacular, the play opening with the loud, alarming cacophony of warplanes and other turmoil ensuing outside the villa. Costume design by Rachel A. Gibian ’15 is also spot-on, with the men in realistic Nazi uniforms, haircuts, and clothing adorned in swastikas.
As the story comes to an end—with the murder of the Jews finalized, all technicalities contested and resolved—the 15 men begin to exit with a faint sparkle in their eyes and a sense of accomplishment in their walk. The servants begin to burn all traces of the rendezvous, and an oddly cheerful Schubert piece plays on the record player as footsteps out the door grow fainter, highlighting the disturbingly mundane treatment of the events that transpired.
“Conspiracy” is multifaceted in its portrayal of the Wannsee Conference, and it ultimately succeeds in putting a human face behind the complex origins of the murder of millions of Jews. With its stark portrayal of the evil in all these men, along with the pure determination and pride they feel in the ensuing genocide, the production is truly memorable and spectacular in all aspects.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Nov. 25, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Nazi officials began crafting a plan to exterminate the Jewish population immediately after the start of the performance; in fact, that idea is not broached until the end of the play. The article also misstated the role of Nazi politician Erich Neumann in crafting the Four Year Plan; in fact, Neumann was the plan’s director, not its author. The article also incorrectly stated that Czech politicians attended the Wannsee conference, while in fact they were not present. Finally the article incorrectly stated that actors spoke with genuine German or Eastern European accents; in fact, the actors only spoke in American or British accents.

"All Bad"
Justin Bieber, album not yet titled
Among Justin Bieber’s recent goings-on, which span from a wrangle with the Brazilian police to a bad bout of food poisoning (Bieber fever, anyone?), the 19-year old has released his newest hit, "All Bad." Opening with a jarring piano chord sequence and an insipid thump masquerading as a beat, JB’s ballad tests the boundaries of tonality and percussion. Bieber’s breathy and raw voice professes disenchantment with all of his haters who, "like pouring fire on propane," have tainted his hitherto innocent track record with the "females." Nearly as uninspired as its lyrics, "All Bad" remains dull and tedious throughout its three minute duration.
"Que Balies Conmigo Hoy"
Fifthe Harmony, "Juntos"
A spunky merging of pop, electronica, and Spanish fluency, Fifth Harmony’s "Que Bailes Conmigo Hoy" bodes well for the nascent girl group, the beloved child of "X Factor" auditions. The song begins fairly formulaically, featuring a charming and energetic a cappella verse that leads into a bubbly electronic build-up. The chorus hits without a moment’s breath and delivers a cheery refrain combining Spice Girl perkiness and TLC nonchalance. Though perhaps lacking in musical sophistication, "Que Bailes Conmigo Hoy" is delightfully light and effervescent.
"Devil in Disguise"
Lecrae, "Church Clothes 2"
Third up on Lecrae’s highly anticipated mixtape "Church Clothes 2," "Devil in Disguise" boldly introduces a bluesy rock riff into a genre largely unacquainted with such sounds. No less intriguing than Lecrae’s musical experiment are his reflective lyrics, which meditate on his purpose and worth as a Christian: "I wanna die but I’m scared of lookin’ in God’s face." A firm and constant cadence underlies Lecrae’s cool rhymes, as he transitions from self-derision to supplication and investigates his dependency on God. "Devil in Disguise" may not be the best jam on "CC2," but it is certainly one of the most innovative.

Let’s start with a quick quiz. Read the following lines, excerpted from the speech of Satan to the damned in a famous work:
“Summoned by name—I am the overseer over you.
Given this command to watch o'er our miserable sphere.
Fallen from grace, called on to bring sun or rain.
Occasional corn from my oversight grew.
Fell with mine angels from a far better place,
offering services for the saving of face.”
Who wrote these lines?
a) John Milton
b) T. S. Eliot
c) William Shakespeare
d) Christopher Marlowe
There are arguments for each. The content is Marlovian, the tone is Miltonic, but the metrical irregularity suggests Eliot, and the closing couplet keeps Shakespeare in the game.
However, none of these is correct. This passage comes from Jethro Tull’s dark 1973 masterpiece, “A Passion Play,” the only album the band released during their heyday that was almost universally disliked. Astonishingly negative reviews were published upon its release: among titles like “Tull: Enough is Enough” (Chris Welch, “Melody Maker) and “Jethro: Nothing to Get Passionate About” (Steve Clarke, “New Musical Express”), one finds such comments as this: “In tone, it is the ultimate exaggeration of self-indulgent English whimsy, an intellectual tease inflated with portent but devoid of wonder—in its cumulative expression mean and trivial” (Stephen Holden, “Rolling Stone”). The dense lyrics were considered juvenile, pretentious, and unintelligible, and the music, while thought better than the lyrics, was compared unfavorably to that of prior albums. The one-song structure was thought to be fatiguing, and due to the perceived opacity of the lyrics, the instrumentals were considered to be completely divorced from the words. All in all, “A Passion Play” was regarded as a flop, an overproduced marker of the band’s decline into irrelevance.
“A Passion Play” is not perfect. Some sections are ridiculous without warrant—the bizarre intermission occupied by “The Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles” comes especially to mind. However, it possesses a grandeur of scope and architecture unrivalled by any other rock album released by a major group in 1973—or any other rock album released at any time. The Who’s 1973 concept album “Quadrophenia,” while a magnificent work in its own way, deals only with the subjective struggles of an angsty teenager. “A Passion Play” deals with metaphysics. The comparison is Catullus to Lucretius, 2 Chainz to Kanye. The elevation of theme and treatment remains unapproached by any rock album ever composed.
From the beginning, the grave nature of “A Passion Play” is clear. The first side opens with indistinct whirring and saxophone strains, punctuated only by a heartbeat that slowly comes to a stop. There is the bang of a closing door—or coffin lid—and distantly, plaintively, frontman Ian Anderson’s cracked voice rises: “‘Do you still see me even here?’ / (The silver cord lies on the ground.) / ‘And so I'm dead,’ the young man said—over the hill (not a wish away).” With this, the audience is introduced to the album’s protagonist, a young Englishman named Ronnie Pilgrim, who has suddenly died and found himself in the afterlife. The heavily allusive nature of the text is evident from the second line—the “silver cord” is a reference to the thread of life cut by the classical Fates. The sophisticated narrative structure is also quickly demonstrated: while the whole song is ostensibly sung in the first person by Ronnie himself, he is giving his own words in the third person. Similarly, the numerous speeches given by other characters in the album are introduced without any sort of warning. As a result, the listener occasionally has difficulty determining when the speaker is a third party or Ronnie addressing himself, an interesting effect that emphasizes the self-inflicted, self-driven nature of his experiences in the underworld.
Much of the album’s greatness comes from this mature and sophisticated treatment of free will, which transcends the teenage-rebel ballads of contemporary bands. Ronnie’s progress through the underworld begins with his judgment at the hands of an unnamed chorus that shows him his life as a movie, numbering to him his earthly virtues, but more importantly, his failings: “Are we here / for the glory / for the story / for the gory satisfaction / of telling you how absolutely awful you really are.” This section is full of the wordplay for which Jethro Tull’s lyrics are famous. The chorus addresses Ronnie about his life’s “premiere”: “Lover of the black and white—it’s your first night,” alluding both to the black-and-white of the film and to Ronnie’s lack of moral sophistication. Throughout, responsibility for his deeds is placed squarely and unrelentingly on Ronnie’s shoulders. The viewing ends with the recurring lyrical and melodic motif that unifies the whole work: “There was / a rush along the Fulham Road. / There was / a hush in the Passion Play.” With this, the first side ends.
The theme of the sovereignty of the human will becomes even stronger on the second side. Despondent after judgment, Ronnie refuses to dwell in heaven, addressing the Deity: “God of Ages / Lord of Time—mine is the right to be wrong.” He then begins his descent with the chilling lines: “Show me a good man. / I’ll show you the door. / The last hymn is sung and the devil cries ‘more.’” Upon meeting Satan, who addresses him with the lines at the beginning of this article and many others in the same vein, Ronnie decides that he has made a terrible mistake and chooses to leave hell: “Flee the icy Lucifer. / Oh, he’s an awful fellow!” His rejection of both hell and heaven leads to the emotional heart of the album, Ronnie’s beautiful recognition of the ambiguous nature of man: “Here’s the everlasting rub: neither am I good nor bad. / I’d give up my halo for a horn and the horn for the hat I once had.” And, in the face of this heartbreaking ambiguity, Ronnie’s need for resolution is recognized and rewarded when a mysterious necromancer revives him, giving him a second chance at life: “Roll the stone away from the dark into ever-day. / There was a rush / along the Fulham Road / into the Ever-passion Play.” Ultimately, it is the strength of Ronnie’s will that results in his resurrection.
Contrary to the critics’ analysis of the instrumentals as something separate from the lyrics, the music in fact is written to accompany them perfectly, even at the level of the individual line. “Melodies decaying in sweet dissonance” is accompanied by a strong, waltz-like energy, fading into an unresolved, yearning cadence. Ronnie’s resurrection is heralded by a ragged, powerful electric blues guitar riff hearkening back to the earliest Tull albums. After the ending words, the record fades into the dissonant saxophone riffs heard distantly at the beginning as Ronnie returns to the chaos of life.
In short, the critics’ accusations fall flat. While the lyrics are a far cry from the simple-minded “She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah” of the early Beatles, they are far from impenetrable, and indeed, clearly convey a compelling story with serious existential overtones. The narrative is peppered with allusions to Milton, Dante, Virgil, and Epicurus, but the lack of a detailed knowledge of these authors does not impede understanding of the action. This is not the empty pretension of Emerson, Lake, & Palmer, but a saga for the common man, about an unremarkable person who has to come to terms with his place in a vast, powerful, and uncaring universe. The music is a perfectly tailored setting for the text—dark, dissonant, and ultimately triumphant. Far from being a work worthy of contempt, “A Passion Play” is a piece about the most vital things to humanity, and as a result, one most worthy of passion.

Who knew that Sir Isaac Newton, the British physicist and mathematician widely regarded as the one of the greatest scientists of all time, was also irritating, foolish, and quite possibly on the brink of insanity? “Isaac’s Eye,” which ran through Saturday at the Adams Pool Theatre, took a different spin on the life of young Isaac Newton and explored the dilemma Newton faced at the start of his scientific career. The play depicted a glimpse of a pivotal time in Newton’s life and illuminated a new understanding that, although Newton left a great scientific legacy behind, his personal journey was somewhat more turbulent. Despite the occasional clumsy dialogue that did not reflect the historical setting, the superb acting under direction of Senikat J. Yusuf ’16 propelled the show to success, ultimately revealing Newton’s underlying search for a fulfilling life.
At first glance, the play seems very minimalistic. The plotline is simple: Newton, desiring to join the renowned Royal Society, becomes entangled in an argument with Robert Hooke on optics, which ultimately leads to a strange experiment in which Newton sticks a needle in his eye. There are only four performers: Todd E. Jones Jr. ’16 as Isaac Newton, Deng-Tung Wang ’17 as Robert Hooke, Lelaina E. Vogel ’15 as Isaac’s female companion Catherine, and Sean K. Hardy ’16 as the narrative character called the Actor. The scenery is also plain: in the center of a nearly empty set rests a wooden chair positioned in front of two adjacent chalkboards. There were almost no scenery changes except for the addition of sound effects such as chirping birds and drizzling rain to emphasize outdoor scenes versus indoor scenes. Yet this minimalism shifted the focus onto the meaningful dialogue and the acting rather than potentially distracting set changes.
The quality of acting itself was impressive and brought to life what could easily have been a bland performance given the lack of action in the play. Jones does a remarkable job portraying Newton as a young man absorbed in his studies. He does not consistently act mature and although Jones brought out the obsessive personality of his character, there were times when he depicted Newton as more of a child than a young man, especially with the bursts of “yay” in his dialogue when he heard good news. Wang was brilliant as Robert Hooke, a well-known scientist of his era with an opium addiction. Vogel put on a superb emotional performance as Catherine; her finest moment was her genuine display of pain and frustration at Newton when she realized he never intended to marry her. As the narrator of the plot, Hardy added a sense of liveliness and spark to the play, driving the storyline forward. All the actors were clearly in sync on stage, and they communicated effortlessly with each other.
The acting was particularly strong during the main conflict of the play, as Newton and Hooke disagreed about the physical state of light. Hooke cruelly dismantles Newton’s ideas, shattering Newton’s hopes to be admitted into the Royal Society. This causes Newton to become so frustrated that he pokes a needle into his eye to prove his own theory that light is a particle, not a wave.
Although the play was well performed and captivating, it was not without its blemishes. There were too many colloquial phrases from modern-day English that did not do justice to the historical setting of Newton’s era. The dialogue was unceremoniously interrupted with phrases such as “for real” and “when Isaac fights, he fights nasty.” Furthermore, there was an unnecessary amount of profanity in the script that was needlessly distracting and made the dialogue seemed forced.
“Isaac’s Eye” was overall nothing short of an impressive performance. Despite its minimal stage design and dialogue that is occasionally historically inaccurate, the high quality of acting brought the production to its full potential and remained engaging until the end.

_Z_: the alias screams its possessor’s anonymity, an anonymity that protects the artist who bears it. _Z_ lives in Paris and works as an architect, but outside of his professional life makes political cartoons and runs a well-read blog. He operates amid a turbulent Tunisian government that uses Islam as a means of control and censored all anti-establishment propaganda prior to the Arab Spring. _Z_ came to Harvard this past week to talk with students from the Center of Middle Eastern Studies and the Graduate School of Design.
The Harvard Crimson: What first motivated you to draw political cartoons?
_Z_: Political issues have always been very close to my heart. I began [drawing cartoons] by criticizing a big real estate project commissioned by Dubai. It was like a UFO—it had nothing to do with the roots, the cultural or the social history of the city in which it was being built.
THC: How has your approach changed over time?
_Z_: I changed my style to access the larger public—not a technical public of urbanists. I attack directly the political system and the dictatorship[, because] all the big decisions [in Tunisia] are made without democratic consultation.
THC: Before starting your blog, did you have any initial hesitations?
_Z_: Of course…. In Tunisia we have the custom [of not speaking] out on the Internet because we have a long history of [repression of] cyber-activism.
THC: What social or political issue do you consider to be most significant in Tunisia?
_Z_: After the revolution, when Islam took power, the social issues changed. Now they use religion to censor [the people], so I attack religion as a political and social tool, and that’s why it can be very violent.
THC: What thematic message do you enjoy drawing about most?
_Z_: Coexistence…. I defend the idea that maybe one day in Tunisia we can live with or without religion, with or without social problems where one majority imposes their laws onto the minorities.
THC: Do you plan to find other mediums through which you can challenge political establishments?
_Z_: Well, unfortunately, I cannot use my ideas in architecture, because architecture is very functional, but one day I hope to start a satirical newspaper with cartoons. But I am still anonymous because in Tunisia we don’t have guarantees in the constitution to be protected. For example, in the first article of the constitution, it is written that Islam is the religion of the state—so anything that is against Islam is against the state. Thus, I am not sure that the law would be on my side should a problem arise.
THC: How do you think the general public receives your ideas?
_Z_: I don’t pretend to make my own politics. My idea is to be in the counter-powers, a civic group of control over the media, but in an artistic way, of course. I am not here to make reports. We say that cartoonists are the thermometers of freedom—that’s why provocation is also a way to test the limits. Through my anonymity, I have the opportunity to push them.

Poetry, music, and theater collided on Friday in Ticknor Lounge as the Black Community and Student Theater group hosted its first annual Spotlight. BlackC.A.S.T., a student arts group that has previously hosted poetry slams and theater events on campus, produced a show consisting of several acts of spoken word poetry, an original song, visual art, and a dramatic monologue, all by Harvard College students.
"Spotlight is really meant to offer a place for people, whatever their art form is, to perform that, to showcase that—particularly people of color, who sometimes don’t have that opportunity on campus," BlackC.A.S.T. president Lanair A. Lett ’14 says. "[BlackC.A.S.T. has] done poetry slams in the past, but this is our first Spotlight, the first time we’ve integrated so many different art forms into one thing." The organization’s past events have included the musical "Dreamgirls," which was performed at Farkas Hall in late April and early May 2013, and the play "Medea," which took place in Cabot Theater in November 2012. The Spotlight differs from these past productions due to its breadth of content and diversity of performers.
Citing the showcase’s original song, monologue, and visual art display, BlackC.A.S.T. vice president Alexis J. Smith ’15 says, "it’s not just spoken word, and it’s not just that we do theater…. We want to be an art space for people of color who don’t always necessarily have that opportunity."
One performer, Bri S. Belser ’15, who performed the event’s original song, entitled "Penny," took this opportunity to share a personal struggle for the first time. "‘Penny’ is a song that I wrote this summer…. It’s about healing after heartbreak, which is so cliché, but I never realized how much being heartbroken could take out of you," she says. "Writing this song, it just got it on paper. It was cathartic, and I just felt like I had to share my healing with the world."
The show’s spoken performances were poetry and readings of published works. "I really enjoyed all the spoken word, since so many people wrote their own pieces," says Yinka A. Akintujoye ’16, who performed a monologue from "Beloved" by Toni Morrison. "You think that just because someone doesn’t have experience with performing that they won’t be able to do well, but when you feel passionately about something, it obviously comes out, and everybody can grasp your feelings easily."
The spoken word poetry tapped into many passionate emotions, from friendship and identity to issues within and beyond the black community. "[You hear] a lot of spoken word about things relevant to people of color…. It was very much about reclaiming their ancestry, about being proud of who they are and their color, and it was very relatable for me personally," Lett says. The performances addressed a variety of issues, ranging from the personal to the political.
In particular, Lett mentioned the piece "Latina Legalese" by Daily Guerrero ‘14 as an example of a work that amazed him. Guerrero describes her poem as both educational and entertaining. "I really wanted to make a connection between the Latino and black community and how, in a way, all of these deportations are imprisoning a lot of people," she says. "So I tried to connect it with the prison-industrial complex and show a little bit more about what’s going on behind the scenes."
The event was intended to welcome contributors from a range of perspectives and backgrounds. "We’re very open people so we foster a space where, if you want to tell your story, we’ll welcome it and we’ll enjoy it," Lett says.
Smith says that it was great to see the ways in which people used the BlackC.A.S.T. platform to express themselves. "People find it so much easier to express things that they won’t necessarily say... in a poem, in a spoken word piece, in a song, and it’s just so beautiful that art allows you to do that."

On Saturday, the Harvard-Radcliffe Mozart Society Orchestra put on its 30th anniversary concert, which showcased the talents of the orchestra in its three-piece program: Bela Bartók’s “Romanian Folk Dances,” Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s Symphony No. 40 in G Minor, and Ludwig van Beethoven’s Triple Concerto in C Major. The two-hour performance highlighted the cohesiveness of the orchestra as well as the technical skill and musicianship of its individual players, who conveyed the wide spectrum of sounds and emotions each piece entailed.
The concert began with Bartok’s “Romanian Folk Dances,” a seven-movement piece in which the orchestra wove together clear melodies with surprising harmonies. With precise control of rhythm and dynamics, conductor Theodoretus I. Breen ’14 captured the eclectic, colorful style of the piece with confidence and accomplished technical execution. The fluctuating tempi of the second movement are not easy to conduct, but Breen successfully kept the orchestra unified throughout the movement. With its seven different types of dances, ranging from the rich “stick dance” of the first movement to the eerie, almost exotic dance of the third movement and the faster-paced dance in the final movement, Bartok’s “Romanian Folk Dances” is a challenging piece to play, but the MSO’s impressive performance belied its difficulty. They not only distinguished between crescendo and diminuendo as well as staccato and legato within each movement, but also differentiated the broad encompassing styles of each movement.
The MSO next performed Mozart’s Symphony No. 40, one of his best known works. The orchestra played nearly perfectly under freshman conductor Sasha G. Scolnik-Brower ’17. The string section performed the familiar sweeping melody in the first movement with lightness and grace, while the brass and wind sections beautifully added a darker and more turbulent tone to the piece. The monumental final movement opened with a series of rapidly ascending notes, which captured the wide sonic range of the orchestra. The shocking changes in volume gave the movement liveliness and vigor.
The final work, Beethoven’s Triple Concerto in C Major, also conducted by Scolnik-Brower, was perhaps the most successful of the three. The orchestra brought in three guest soloists: violinist Stella F. Chen ’15, cellist Andree R. Werner ’16, and pianist Mariel A. Werner ’16. The intricate interplay among the soloists and the orchestra created an interesting and unconventional performance; few pieces demand so many soloists. Each soloist performed her entrance and moment well, and together their sounds complemented one another and emphasized the joyful theme of the piece. The orchestral melody of the first movement was echoed by the rich cello, the smooth and silky piano, and the clear violin. Not only was the dialogue between the soloists and the orchestra clear, but within the orchestra itself, there was a nuanced exchange among the string, brass, and wind sections.
The orchestra’s powerful performance showcased the musical ability and technical mastery of the talented members of the MSO. The three compositions selected for the program were difficult to play, but the MSO assembled the pieces into a brilliantly performed concert. The strings interacted well with the brass and wind sections with precise timing and cohesiveness. In addition, the conductors effortlessly commanded the orchestra with confidence and skill. For those who enjoy orchestral music, the MSO’s concerts are definitely a must-see: the MSO executes its pieces with great passion and attention that illustrate the hard work and time its performers put into their music.

On an August day in New York this past summer, Madeleine F. Bersin ’14 found herself at a table surrounded by world-class actors from the cast of “The Glass Menagerie,” a revival of the Tennessee Williams play that the American Repertory Theater had debuted in Cambridge earlier this year.
“The director was asking everyone what time they were first exposed to Tennessee Williams,” Bersin recounts. “And so I just felt like the luckiest little girl in the world, getting to hear all these amazing actors say, ‘Oh, my first exposure to Tennessee Williams was this, this, and this!’”
Bersin, who had been an intern on the show at the ART, also assisted for two weeks in its transition to New York. “I was blown away by being in the room in the first place. And of course, I was not expecting to have to give an answer!” To her surprise, director John Tiffany then asked her to share her own experience.
“To be asked that in that room was so heartwarming and made me feel very included,” she says.  “[What] makes the best theater [is] when you’re really willing to include all your collaborators, from lowly interns to two-time Tony Award winners,” she says.
What was most memorable to Bersin about the experience was not being on Broadway so much as this moment of togetherness with the crew. This sense of sharing in the project of theater is something the ART has been cultivating for the past five years. Since the arrival of artistic director Diane M. Paulus ’88, the ART has been developing a new identity for itself on several fronts, including increased ties to New York, opportunities for Harvard students to assist large productions, and devotion to spreading participation in making theater.
ART HISTORY
Like Bersin, audience members at many recent ART plays may be caught off guard by the invitation to participate in what they are watching. In “The Donkey Show,” which plays in the ART’s OBERON Theater, the audience wanders a disco floor, dancing with actors who run around enacting scenes from “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” as musical numbers. “Pippin,” a show from last season that went on to win four Tonys, ended with a sudden dismantling of the backdrop so that the actors broke the fourth wall and joined the “real world” of the spectators.
A major aim of ART productions under Paulus is “always including the audience as a partner,” as the ART’s website reads. Whether on the stage or off, whether in costume or not, everyone is a valued participant.
This was historically not always the case. From its opening under Robert Brustein through the first two decades thereafter, the ART ran nationally well-known productions, including several Broadway shows. But by 2008, when his successor had reportedly brought the ART into financial trouble with high-cost, low-revenue, low-attendance productions, a new leader was needed. Hiring Paulus, who had attracted attention with the 1999 off-Broadway premiere of “The Donkey Show,” would be the start of several changes for the ART.
Civry P. Melvin ’14, a former production intern with the ART who worked on the set of “Pippin,”  believes that Paulus bridges a gap between commercial theaters and less accessible intellectual theaters. “She has a foresight to understand what audiences are going to respond to,” Melvin says. “That’s why people like her so much: because she thinks about what an audience is going to respond to and what an audience is going to find interesting.” 
BRATTLE TO BROADWAY
One of the most visible signs of this growth in commercial appeal is the new ART’s recent back-to-back sequence of shows that go to New York. This year, both “Glass Menagerie” and “All the Way” will appear on Broadway, following the path of “The Gershwins’ Porgy and Bess” in 2011 and “Pippin” in 2012. But for the ART’s staff, this image of their theater as a kind of “fast-track for Broadway” is misleading.
ART producer Diane Borger acknowledges the trend: “Definitely more shows have gone in the past three years than in the previous 30, so that’s true,” she says. “As soon as you send one thing to New York, the New York people start looking more.”
But these developments, Borger says, haven’t affected her way of looking at the ART’s productions. “We don’t start thinking, ‘Oh, how can we do it on Broadway?’” she laughs. “I think sometimes in the theater, that’s a recipe for failure.” Getting name association with Broadway, to many who have worked on ART productions, is useful for income and publicity, but is not the main goal.
Krithika Varagur ’15, who was a J-Term marketing intern for “The Glass Menagerie,” agrees. “I think the ART wants to be first and foremost providing theater for the Cambridge and Boston metro community,” Varagur says. “So [Broadway is] definitely not like a telos or anything.”
“A VERY DIFFERENT ANIMAL”
There is a great difference between theater and Broadway and at the ART: the ART can afford to focus more on the artists’ vision and worry less about selling tickets. “We are a not-for-profit theater, and so we’re very mission-driven,” managing director William Russo says.
“[This] is what we are here to do: to give the artist that we work with that kind of freedom, to say, ‘It’s okay if it fails,’” Russo says.
By contrast, there are more risks and pressure in for-profit theaters like those in New York. “If a show is done on Broadway, immediately you’re starting with the mission to return the investment and make a profit,” Russo says. “No one’s going to say, ‘Take my $14 million—if you fail, that’s okay!’”
Both Borger and Russo habitually refer to past productions as if each show were a human being. “We can protect a show much more than a Broadway producer in New York can,” Russo says. When he says “protect a show,” his arms make a hugging gesture, as if he were a drawing a child protectively to his chest. 
Varagur believes that whether a show goes to New York or not implies nothing about its quality. “There are so many factors involved in getting it picked up for New York,” she says. “There are a lot of things, like availability and what kind of show it is.”
It is also a matter of having industry connections in New York. “Diane Paulus is very well connected, obviously,” Melvin says. “She’s done a bunch of shows on Broadway.… She’s a person that people know in the business. [She and Diane Borger] both have reached out to other producers in New York.”
For each show that does go, the experience is different. One thing is consistent, though. “It will always involve some kind of partnership,” Russo says. “In that partnership, we will participate artistically and financially. When it goes to New York, that commercial partner usually takes over control, and we’re in support of that.”
According to Russo, the New York staffs have more knowledge on marketing shows to a Broadway audience. “It’s a very different animal,” Russo says of New York theater. “It’s kind of like both parties joining at a point where they really have the expertise.”
While management shifts, the same costumes and scenery are transported to the new location. Slight alterations may be made to the direction, and at times cast members may change, but otherwise, it is the same production.
For the cast and crew, Borger says, getting an extension on the life of their show also means having more time to perfect the show. “The artist goes, ‘Oh my goodness! So lucky! I get to do it again! And that scene I never got right? Now I know how to fix it.’”
COMMUNITY THEATER
One outcome of the ART’s spirit of inclusivity and outreach to more potential audience demographics is its improving relationship with Harvard drama students. Through the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club, as well as other venues on campus, many Harvard students already participate in non-professional theater. But a chance to work with the ART confers distinct advantages, whether through resume-building internships or through theater workshops offered by staff of the affiliated ART Institute. As there is no theater concentration at Harvard, the role of the ART becomes especially significant.
Bersin, who is the HRDC president, says these opportunities—often with stipends—have been mostly recent implementations. Internships such as the ones Varagur and Melvin did, for example, were not created until recently.
It was one of Bersin’s main goals for the year to create even closer ties to the ART, including more advising for students. “We’re all here all the time, so there’s no reason we shouldn’t be taking advantage of the amazing people that are here,” Bersin says.
She also notes that formerly, relations between HRDC and the ART had more friction. ”I think there was a time when students felt they were being stepped on,” she says. According to Bersin, this came from communication problems and a mentality that each group should keep out of the other’s way. “But now we’re in a place where we can talk and [recognize that] working together actually produces better work,” she says. “There’s still work to be done, but I think we’re moving in the direction of being a more collaborative entity.”
NATIONAL FAME, LOCAL FOCUS
The role of the ART as a professional tool for students is significant not because of the ART’s reputation, but more because of the community values it teaches. For all involved, there is a sense of connectedness—not only for audience, but also among the people in the production.
According to Melvin, Paulus is the main force behind the close bonds forged between actors. “She has this magic where she can take a cast—they don’t know each other at all, and suddenly they become this great community.” 
Her own experience with “Pippin” was in keeping with this: “I came in, and this was the first time this cast was meeting each other. And they are still together.… They’re like best friends now. Diane Paulus is really good at creating that community within a cast—really, you can see that on the stage.”
For her own part, Bersin agrees. “I think the ART for sure has been one of the most welcoming places where I’ve worked,” she says. “When you do good work, they recognize it and continue to give you good opportunities, which is what I’ve been so lucky to have here.” Having worked on the sets of “Marie Antoinette” and “Pippin,” she now has many connections and valuable friendships to help her advance in a dramatic career post-graduation. “To feel like everyone that I’m working for and working with knows each other is really great,” Bersin says. “You get this expanding network of people that all have worked with you…and can pass you on to other good people you would like to work with.”
For Varagur, who was not working directly with the cast and is not sure if she wants a career in drama, the theme of connection promoted by the new ART was profoundly impressive.  “Working for a really professional theater like the ART, where everyone is just on point and they bring really amazing quality artists from every field, really oriented me to their goals,” she says. “And I found it really in line with [the ART’s] goals to bring art to the wider community and make it more accessible, so I was really interested in their outreach initiatives.”
Today’s buzz around the ART’s successive Broadway shows fades to secondary significance in the minds of its workers. All interviewed ART staff and interns agreed that repeat Broadway calls are a great phenomenon and well-deserved for the ART. But Borger speaks with as much tenderness of their pieces that go to New York as she does of those that go to London or other destinations. “We’re doing a show this year with a performing arts center in Las Vegas, which probably seems a bit unlikely, but that’s what we’re doing,” Borger says. “I don’t think we rule anything out. We’re like, ‘We could do that! Oh, we could do that!’”
“I just think that if we’re trying to get it out to wider audiences—sometimes it’s on Broadway, sometimes it’s other places in New York, sometimes it’s on tour,” she says. “One of our shows went over to London. So there are many ways for us to give extended lives to our shows.”
The ART’s project to redefine itself is partly reflected by its Broadway streak in recent years. But going to New York is just one chapter in the story of the ART’s modelling of a new identity. After each show in Cambridge, what is most exciting to Borger, Russo, and all those who work with them is the simple possibility of keeping their creation alive. It matters not which afterlife shows have; what matters is that there be some life to be had at all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Nov. 2, Kerry Washington was the ninth black woman to host “Saturday Night Live.” In a self-referential cold open, Washington portrayed Michelle Obama and then Oprah (and a whisper of Beyoncé), acknowledging the lack of black women on SNL’s cast. However funny the sketch was, its ability to deliver comically does not solve SNL’s problems with diversity. In addition to the nine black women who have hosted, in 751 shows over 38 years SNL has had four black female cast members (Yvonne Hudson, Danitra Vance, Ellen Cleghorne, and most recently, Maya Rudolph). If a sketch calls for a black woman, she is usually portrayed by a black male cast member (of which there have only been 7 in the show’s history). SNL has answered this troubling discrepancy with a humorous sketch, but does that mean that a real solution is near?
 
Dr. Kellie Carter Jackson, a fellow in the African & African American Studies Department, and Professor Glenda R. Carpio both teach classes that have deep implications regarding black women in entertainment—Jackson teaches African and African American Studies 139y: “Hollywood and History: Understanding American Slavery Through Film” and Carpio teaches African and African American Studies 112: “Black Humor: Performance, Art, and Literature.” They sat down with The Crimson to discuss Washington’s sketch and its larger repercussions on the future of African American women in Hollywood.
 
The Harvard Crimson: What did you both think of the sketch?
 
Kellie Carter Jackson: I didn’t think it was funny at all, and I kind of felt that it was demeaning in the sense that SNL knows that they have no black women on their show, so it was a backhanded apology where they were saying “oh we’re working on it, and in the meantime, we’re going to crack jokes about it.” It felt very disingenuous to have this sketch as a background into explaining why they have no black women. I didn’t find it funny at all.
 
Glenda R. Carpio: Well, I thought that the writing was not very good. I think it sticks to the formula that black people make jokes about being black; it puts things into racial categories. By the same token, you don’t see a lot of films about black culture that are not about black history. So, it’s a complicated set of issues, but the skit itself stuck to very traditional ways of thinking about race and humor.
 
THC: In response to the outrage over the issue, SNL actor Kenan Thompson insinuated that black women aren’t ready for comedy, stating that at SNL auditions they had never found any who were. Do you agree?
 
KCJ: Wow—to me, Kenan’s comment was very problematic because it also shows you how much Kenan is entrenched in the belief in this “good ol’ boys club,” which is not just SNL, but is representative of so many media outlets. If you were to look today on TV shows, you don’t see black women characters on comedy sketches on “Modern Family,” on your big shows that are popular now; I’ve never seen a black person on “The Big Bang Theory.” Even if you think of TV miniseries or film, it’s very difficult to just see black women in general, and I think it’s not just SNL that has a problem. It’s a larger problem, TV and film that has a huge problem of having and cultivating a white-male-privilege identity. And everything else revolves around that, and it’s very very exclusive. Out of 23 writers on SNL, only one is a black woman. I don’t think it’s reflective of the world we live in today—certainly not in 2013 where the United States is becoming more black and more brown. It’s not representative of what humor looks like on a national scale, or at least should look like on a national scale.
 
GRC: Let’s, for a second, give [SNL] the benefit of the doubt. Not that [black women are] not ready for it—I wouldn’t say that black women aren’t ready, but let’s just try and understand their position. Historically, women in general haven’t had physical outlets to do comedy. Women can be witty and even sarcastic on paper, and that’s a way of doing comedy that’s been safe for women. But take stand-up or sketch comedy, for instance, which relies a lot on body humor—not always, but it often does. This has prevented women from accessing the stage—more so for black women, for the complicated issues of race intersecting that. One iota of truth in Kenan’s statement is that we, as a nation, have not produced enough opportunities for that tradition to grow.
 
THC: So the main issue is that Hollywood has not created enough space and opportunity?
 
GRC: I think we don’t have enough venues for black women to think of themselves, from children onwards, in that way. We don’t see them on stage; we don’t have venues for them. Even within the black community, the huge names in comedy are mostly male. The humor adheres in some ways to patriarchal ways of thinking about sexuality and gender.
 
KCJ: It’s interesting, too, because Maya Rudolph has probably been the most successful black woman on the show, but part of that is because she is somewhat racially ambiguous. She doesn’t just play black women on the show—she’s played Lucy Liu, Barbra Streisand, a whole array of characters. It would be interesting to me to see how skin tone plays into the perceptions of humor and who can play what roles. Maya Rudolph can get a pass because she can somewhat pass. But for other women who have are dark skinned, they get relegated into spaces of what we think a darker skinned woman should look or act like.
 
THC: Does it make a difference that in recent years the black women that have appeared on the show have been light-skinned (Kerry Washington, Maya Rudolph, Halle Berry)?
 
KCJ: I think it’s all in terms of people’s perceptions, and that perception of lighter-skinned women is that they’re less threatening and more attractive to wider audiences. Dark-skinned women, in TV and definitely in film, have more aggressive roles—the stereotypical neck rolling and finger snapping and even their weight (they are usually heavy). All of that plays into people’s expectations of what they expect to see and what they think is funny. Maya Rudolph doesn’t fit those traditional expectations, and Kerry Washington, to some degree, doesn’t either. “Scandal” has allowed her to do a lot more than other women, that other black women haven’t been able to do in recent years.
 
GRC: We often look at these issues from the perspective of the actors, but it is important to look at the shows from the perspective of the writers. Kerry Washington is such a talented actress and could have done a lot more if she had better writing on SNL. So it’s not only a matter of who is going to be funny on stage, but who is also able to imagine the world from a black woman’s perspective and what might be funny from a black woman’s perspective.
 
THC: Founding producer Lorne Michaels responded that he’s sure this problem will rectify itself but that it’s not a priority. Does this attitude imply that this Hollywood casting process somehow sets black women up to fail? Or is this a societal issue?
 
KCJ: It’s not so much a matter of black women “coming around,” but the culture changing—the producers, the writers, the advertisers—everything that is involved in making a show; everyone who has power in giving a yay or nay. That culture has to change. Power can seize nothing without demand. Martin Luther King Jr. says “change does not roll in on the wheels of inevitability”—it requires constant agitation. You can’t just say that in time things will get better and not expect things to be in play to lead up the change. Change and progress are not inevitable. It comes through a demand, agitation, activism, a changing of the culture. Until you start to see more black women writers, more Latina women writers, more Asian women writers—because it’s not just an issue of not having black women—until you can get more representations within the writers and the producers and all of the people calling shots, you’re never going to see a reflection change on camera. Until the culture changes, I don’t see this changing.
 
THC: So do you think this issue stems from culture or Hollywood?
 
GRC: They’re mutually constituted—Hollywood creates us and we create Hollywood. We have to talk about what happens when we put race into humor. Humor relies on melodrama and sentimentalism. Americans don’t also go to humor and race and gender because it brings up all the dirty laundry, and I don’t know that you can do that on SNL. You can do that in a medium that is less censored. But what we get when, say, we put gender and race in humor is really edgy stuff. For instance, Richard Pryor’s show was canceled; he couldn’t work within it, because he wanted to bring up things that were not kosher for regular TV, barely kosher for “Comedy Central.” This is part of the problem too—the discourses that we have are limited to feeling about racial issues, but feeling on the surface.
 
THC: So does the future rely on film as a medium for this progress?
 
KCJ: The producers are all coming from the same pot. A lot of people who are in film are in TV and vice versa. They’re operating out of the same machine but with different agendas. When you go up to the highest levels, people of color are just not there. In terms of the highest power structure—the CEOs, the people who own the TV stations, the people who own the industry—people of color are just not in there. Until you see changes at the top, those things will filter down somewhat. Or until people push up from the bottom, saying “this is what we want,” you won’t get change. People have to demand. People have been outraged that black women aren’t on SNL; I haven’t seen a real movement or people mobilizing or spotlighting them or creating more shows or venues for people of color. But it’s out there. If you go on YouTube you can find people who would be great on SNL. But people see that as a risk—people won’t find that funny, or it won’t become profitable. Profit is the bottom line at the end of the day, which means you’ll never get the humor you want because being funny is not your main interest, it’s making money. That is problematic.
 
GRC: What makes money is a safe way of talking about race. Taking chances on representation is always a question of a risk. Take “12 Years A Slave”—a lot of the discussion around it was whether it would make money. It's an interesting question because the film is so invested in getting us to think historically, it’s not about entertainment. You don’t go to see that film to watch passively and enjoy. You might enjoy the artistry but certainly not the plot. So are we talking about entertainment or things that push the envelope? SNL is mainly entertainment. So the question might be, what is a safe way to put black women on stage? Well, looking historically at the subject of “black women in America,” the history behind that is not very safe!
 
THC: What about someone like Tyler Perry, who is broaching these unsafe topics and has also managed to be very successful?
 
KCJ: Tyler Perry has done a lot of the black comedies that have come out recently. He’s been hugely successful in the black and outside the black community—it’s not just black people who see his films. But Tyler Perry also operates in a very fixed formula that doesn’t diverge from the same characters. He recycles them a lot—the language, the vernacular, the humor. All of it is very structured and formulaic in terms of what you expect to see in a Tyler Perry film. All of it will have a moral, Christian bend to it. That’s his M.O. I can appreciate the fact that he is providing black people with jobs and visible roles. I can applaud that. I’m not a huge fan of his, because I don’t see myself being represented in his films. A lot of his films are anti-woman, especially his last film “Temptation” which was awful. It kind of said, “if you cheat on your husband, you will get AIDS and die,” which was almost the essential premise of the film—that if you are not this moral woman, that you deserve damnation and every single evil you can imagine. The issue I have with Tyler Perry is the issue I have in a general sense: when you look at white directors, and you look at white men who are making film, there’s a whole spectrum and range—you can pull on Spielberg, J.J. Abrams, and Scorsese. But when it comes to a black film, it’s like Spike Lee and Tyler Perry and that’s it. And when you look at black women directors, it’s like "who?" I don’t mind Tyler Perry, but I don’t want Tyler Perry to be the only story of black comedy or black film. I want the same level of diversity that white audiences have when they see film in terms of how many stories are told, when they’re told—a spectrum of diversity, and not one person can do all that. Even if Tyler Perry was making good films, he can’t do all of that by himself.
THC: You mention Perry’s recycling of characters like Madea, which have been thought to continue perpetuating stereotypes like “the mammy.” What are your thoughts on this?
 
KCJ: I’m highly offended every time I see a black man dress up as a black women. When women dress up as men, it’s not funny. When men dress up as women, it is a form of mockery that I feel makes women into these ridiculous characters. It’s always oversize breasts and ridiculous wigs; it is the whole notion that women are superficial, ridiculous, frivolous, stupid—all of these negative attributes. No man dresses up as a woman as a compliment—it’s always a form of mockery, always a place of denigration. That goes for Kenan Thompson, for Tyler Perry, for Eddie Murphy. Even when white men dress up as women. For me, it screams farce. It’s hard to find that to be funny the more I become sensitive to issues of imagery and representation and I feel as though the whole man dressed up as a woman thing is tired. You almost expect it when it comes out. Because Tyler Perry perpetuates that with the Madea, and there’s so much around that—she’s a big black women and she’s sassy, all of these stereotypes we think black women are. It’s hard for women to compete for an authentic space when even men are co-opting those spaces, thinking “we can play a woman better than you.” It boggles my mind that men think they can be funnier playing us, than to actually have us playing authentic characters of women ourselves.
GRC: Call me a snob, but I go for, “do you have the chops to do good comedy? Is this actually funny?” Politically correct does not always go hand-in-hand with good comedy. Black humor has only been desegregated since the late '60s—so that’s only about a 45-year period—which is not a long time since black humor has become more mainstream. There are still pockets of black humor that are still in pockets. Some of Tyler Perry’s films live in those pockets, and some of the work he does is in this Christian air that keeps him from writing really good comedy, to be honest. You can’t tell the truth about anyone if you can’t tell the truth about yourself. If you have these blind spots and misogyny, you might make humor out of that and it might be funny to some people, but will it be humor that outlives time? Not sure.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1970, Harvard finally committed to gender integration of the Houses. Forty years later, we’re still fighting for the right to choose our roommates.
The petition to expand gender-neutral housing to all Harvard College students has gathered enough signatures to appear as a referendum on the Undergraduate Council ballot. This week, Harvard students will have the opportunity to vote on whether or not they believe that gender-neutral housing options should become a College-wide policy. If the referendum passes, the UC is expected to adopt a position in support of campus-wide gender-neutral housing.
Gender-neutral housing gives the students on this campus the choices they deserve; everyone should feel comfortable and safe in their dorms and houses. Freshman year, Harvard mandates an extensive survey for incoming students, and students are matched with roommates with whom they feel they can thrive. Harvard puts a premium on the undergraduate House life experience, and, for the following three years, the administration allows students to choose their roommates by giving them the opportunity to “block” with single- and mixed-gender groups.
The truth? If the students you choose to live with are of a different gender, Harvard backpedals. Gender-neutral housing is currently a patchwork of policies determined by individual House Masters. Two years ago, the Office of Student Life implemented a pilot program that allowed Houses to opt in to a more relaxed policy that gives students more freedom in choosing their rooms—without all the bureaucratic hassle. Moreover, House residents are already having conversations and proving to their House Masters and House administrators that gender-neutral housing is practical and safe. Not only has the program been successful logistically, students have overwhelmingly had positive experiences with their rooming situations.
Opponents of gender-neutral housing often miss the mark with their criticism, claiming that students and blocking groups will be forced to live in mixed-gender rooms. However, gender-neutral housing is truly about the freedom to choose one’s roommates and to make students feel safer and more comfortable in their own dorms. This is about more than sexuality or even gender identity—this is about freedom of association and about resolving incongruous, paternalistic assumptions about gender-specific housing. Already, students in single-gender suites have visitors and guests from the opposite-sex; what will change about our bathrooms and rooms once different genders are allowed to live together? Harvard doesn’t regulate mixed-gender housing when we live off-campus for the summer—why should they during the school year? No student should be forced to justify their rooming choices.
The referendum on the UC ballot does not mandate gender-neutral housing for anyone—it just marks the first step in demonstrating to the administration that students care about the issue and seek to make their own decisions about who they want to live with. Approving the referendum will be the first step in assuring that all students are given the freedom to make the choices that they feel the most comfortable with.
It’s time for Harvard to move into the 21st century. Demand your right to choice by voting yes on Question One for administrative action to implement campus-wide gender-neutral housing options.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A post-racial America was not inaugurated alongside Barack Obama in 2008—no matter how much you wish it so. Perhaps after viewing the unflinchingly brutal vérité of “12 Years a Slave,” it would be comforting to think of this country’s long legacy of racial oppression as a long-dead evil of centuries past.
Yet the Supreme Court invalidated “separate but equal” public education fewer than 60 years ago—and many years were spent beating back the Southern massive resistance movement before anything approaching racial integration materialized. Prohibitions of interracial marriage were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in the 1967 case Loving v. Virginia—fewer than 50 years ago.
In 1947, a two-term governor and senator like Theodore Bilbo could assuredly write that he “would rather see his race and his civilization blotted out with the atomic bomb than to see it slowly but surely destroyed in the maelstrom of miscegenation, interbreeding, intermarriage and mongrelization.”
To be sure, openly racist rhetoric has retreated from the political mainstream, instead reincarnating itself in Nixon’s Southern strategy or Reagan’s young bucks and welfare queens. Decades from today, we’ll look at the spate of voting identification laws, prompted by this summer’s Supreme Court ruling that struck down the heart of the Voting Rights Act, in the same way we do the poll taxes, grandfather clauses, and literacy tests of the Reconstruction Era. To then claim that all semblance of racist intent and motivation has dissipated since then because the laws and policies are now written to be facially race-neutral is utterly naïve if not outrightly disingenuous.
But perhaps more noxious to democracy is the muted reaction to the myriad laws that disproportionately disadvantage minorities—an attitude that considers them minor difficulties and simply necessary evils. Consider the blasé reactions to the New York Police Department’s stop-and-frisk policy that target black and Hispanic communities and surveillance of Muslim students all the way in New Jersey and draconian cuts to the food stamps program and state unemployment insurance programs. On the other hand, laws that benefit minorities, like affirmative action or public housing projects, are favorite political targets that much of the public has come to see as unmeritorious and undeserved handouts.
And it’s not just the legal sphere. From even a cursory glance at recent headlines, one sees racially charged controversies like Julianne Hough donning blackface, Kanye West’s attempted reclamation of the Confederate flag, and the racial slurs Miami Dolphins guard Richard Incognito hurled at teammate Jonathan Martin.
To add to all that, the country must be perpetually subjugated to the idiocies of columnist Richard Cohen through a platform no less prestigious than the Washington Post. In an abysmal column published last week, he wrote:
“People with conventional views must repress a gag reflex when considering the mayor-elect of New York—a white man married to a black woman and with two biracial children. (Should I mention that Bill de Blasio’s wife, Chirlane McCray, used to be a lesbian?) This family represents the cultural changes that have enveloped parts—but not all—of America. To cultural conservatives, this doesn’t look like their country at all.”
Somehow, Cohen continues to defiantly defend his column, saying that the “word racist is truly hurtful.” The editorial page editor, Fred Hiatt ’77, a former Crimson news writer, has only said that he “erred in not editing that one sentence more carefully.” Katharine Weymouth, the publisher of the Post, even hailed the column as “brilliant” in a laudatory tweet.
Suppose we take Cohen at his word—that some farrago of inartful thinking, inartful writing, and inartful editing is the sole cause of the mess. Even then, the writing is troublingly unthinking in its attempt to explain away racism as the result of a well-intentioned, “conventional” desire for social conservatism. But conservatism is not an end to itself—any conservatism is only as good as the policies it seeks to preserve.
Cohen claims the criticisms lack context. So let’s contextualize Cohen—it doesn’t take much research to understand the unconventional awfulness of Richard Cohen’s conventional wisdom.
He’s drawn considerable criticism in the past for supporting the right of store owners to exclude black costumers, defending George Zimmerman since Trayvon Martin was “a young man understandably suspected because he was black,” subjecting female interns to a “hostile work environment,” and attempting to explain the Steubenville rape cases in terms of Miley Cyrus.
It’s enough to make people with conventional views gag.
Viewed most optimistically, Cohen’s comments come near the denouement of this country’s long struggle with race-based discrimination. That racism is increasingly odious to society is progress, but that progress must be codified in the country’s laws—both de jure and de facto—to be complete.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The United States Senate recently produced a massive report assessing the merits of “enhanced interrogation”—America’s euphemism for torture—which sits classified and unpublished in a Capitol Hill vault.
The Obama Administration opposes declassification, but that doesn’t mean we don’t know what it says. Indications are that the report confirms what I learned in 23 years of working in the CIA and revealed in my book, “The Interrogator”: Torture does not work and provides virtually no useful intelligence.
I was involved in the enhanced interrogation program and served as a senior officer responsible for terrorist reporting. The foundation of my understanding, however, came not from my government training but from the lecture halls of Harvard.
The realization came as an al-Qaida prisoner sat frozen before me, my own fingers numbing from the cold. My CIA superior had ordered me to “do whatever it takes” to get the prisoner to talk and lead us to Osama Bin Laden, emphasizing the point with a jab to my chest. I stared at the shackled detainee. Incongruously, Sanders Theatre, 12,000 miles and 25 years away, came to mind. And I thought of Mr. Magoo.
My sophomore year I took Humanities 103: “The Great Age of Athens” with the fabled John H. Finley ’25. Legend was that a former student of Finley’s had created Mr. Magoo based on the scholar’s eccentricities. And the professor was … distinctive. He hemmed, and wheezed, and held the text he was reading an inch from his eyes, bottle glasses forgotten atop his head. He spoke like bagpipes, in disjointed clauses, an incomprehensible nasal drone in iambic pentameter, communing with shades 2,400 years dead, unaware that 400 undergraduates were suppressing giggles before him.
But I thrilled to “The Iliad,” “The Odyssey,” “The Oresteia,” and above all, Thucydides’ “Peloponnesian War.” When the lectures ended I had to run across the Yard, down Boylston Street (now John F. Kennedy) to Watson Rink (now the Bright-Landry Hockey Center) for hockey practice.
As I ran from Sanders to hockey I took away the political and moral lessons Finley taught in his lecture on “The Peloponnesian War:” The Melian dialogue, of course, is perhaps the most distilled case in the Western canon of the clash between morality and realpolitik. But it was Thucydides’ psychological insights that were most relevant to me in my career; few of my peers had studied the humanities as I had.
Thucydides teaches that understanding the deep human motivators of fear, honor, and interest enables us to understand foreign relations as well as our enemies. Understanding those motivators also makes a good operations officer, one better equipped to recruit spies and conduct successful interrogations.
For intelligence work and interrogation are profoundly human enterprises.
My superiors, and particularly the neoconservative armchair interrogators who designed and ordered “enhanced interrogation,” lacked this psychological insight. They equated power with strength and were obtuse to human nature. It was clear that “enhanced interrogation” was illegal; it was also clear to me that enhanced interrogation created fear and anger, and made psychological understanding, and therefore successful interrogations, impossible. Torture is atavistic, an expression of power, the humiliation of a foe. It has nothing to do with obtaining intelligence. These impulses are rooted in our fears and in our amygdalas, not the reasoning portion of our brains, and so torture recurs whenever humans are afraid, or angry, and have power over one’s imagined foe. Only our laws—reason codified and applied—can protect us to any extent from our impulses.
I rejected “enhanced interrogation”—torture—out of hand. Instead, I talked with my prisoner. Sixteen hours a day sometimes. I established a rapport with him. We spoke of religion, his aspirations and motivations, his preferences on all sorts of topics. I assessed his fears, what would give him honor or tarnish it, what he wanted—his “interest.” I wanted to understand, and so take advantage of, my prisoner’s own needs.
It all went back quite consciously to Sanders Theatre. I had learned from Thucydides to understand the subject, while the architects of enhanced interrogation believed it necessary to “break” them. And as they ignored their opponent’s humanity, we became inhuman ourselves, failing both practically and morally.
The case, like the entire program of enhanced interrogation, proved a disgrace. The man was not what we believed him to be. It is a long, painful story, an allegory for the horrors of the War on Terror. But I was able to retain my humanity and my honor and yet fulfill my mission of interrogating an al-Qaida detainee successfully, quite explicitly because of my study of Thucydides in Sanders Theatre long ago.
I am sure the blocked Senate report on enhanced interrogation will show what I lived: Enhanced interrogation does not work. Interrogation based on rapport does. The report needs to be published so that the truth is known and the false debate ended.
I re-read “The Peloponnesian War” 30 years after taking “The Great Age of Athens” as a sophomore and years after interrogating my al-Qaida detainee. It made me cry.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“In any war between the civilized man and the savage, support the civilized man. Support Israel; defeat Jihad.”
So reads an advertisement from the American Freedom Defense Initiative, an organization that spews equally racist rhetoric across the country. After the MBTA rejected the proposed advertisement because it violated rules that ads could not be “demeaning or disparaging,” the AFDI filed a lawsuit against the transit agency.
They claim that the MBTA applied a double standard because it had allowed an ad that shows four maps of “the Palestinian loss of land” from 1946 to 2010 accompanied by the text “4.7 million Palestinians are Classified by the UN as Refugees.” The decision to block the AFDI’s ad, the logic goes, can only be explained by the MBTA’s “discriminatory animus against those who support Israel.”
The AFDI is wrong. The pro-Palestine ad is surely controversial, but it is not racist. It does not make its point by dehumanizing its political opponents to the level of savages. The AFDI’s ad is incontestably “demeaning and disparaging” of Palestinians and Muslims, and the MBTA was right to deny it.
The AFDI won a legal challenge last year against the New York Metro Transit Authority, which had decided not to run the same ad, on First Amendment grounds that the “[MTA] non-demeaning standard as currently drafted is impermissibly content-based” because it proscribed specific discrimination on the basis of race, gender, and sexuality among other categories. But that district court decision does not seem to apply to the MBTA guidelines, which make no similar content-based judgments.
Of course, we are skeptical of attempts by government to decide which kinds of political speech are valid and which can be prohibited. The constitutional question of free speech rights on public forums is complex and best left to the courts.
But the answer to the ethical question is abundantly clear: Depictions of people as subhuman, whether Muslim, Jewish, white, or black, is repulsive in its similarity to historical rhetoric that incited centuries of discrimination and oppression. The ad’s racist content is unsurprising though, given that the AFDI’s cofounders, Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer, both maintain popular, virulently Islamophobic blogs.
Reducing a decades-long conflict between Israel and Palestine to a Manichaean struggle between “civilized men” and “savages” is also ahistorical in its implicit attempt to absolve Israel of serious allegations of human rights abuses. The pro-Palestine ad may well be considered ahistorical too—though it does not sink to the level of the AFDI. The group could certainly present its pro-Israel position powerfully without resorting to unconscionable disparagement of Palestinians.
We hope that the court sides with the MBTA in its decision to reject the outrightly racist ad.
In any battle between discrimination and non-discrimination, we support non-discrimination.

CORRECTION: November 20, 2013
An earlier version of this editorial erroneously stated that the MBTA printed an ad that read, "4.7 Palestinians are Classified by the UN as Refugees.” In fact, the text of the ad reads, “4.7 million Palestinians are Classified by the UN as Refugees.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After Senate Republicans blocked four of President Barack Obama’s nominees to the major federal appeals court in the District of Columbia, political experts have raised doubts about the successful confirmation of Harvard Law School Professor David J. Barron ’89, a nominee for the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.
Barron, a former Crimson president who graduated from the Law School two years before Obama, must be approved by the Senate in order to join the First Circuit—an occurrence that seems increasingly unlikely as Democrats fail to break through Republican filibusters that have so far thwarted Obama’s attempts to appoint judges.
Barron's confirmation hearing is scheduled for Wednesday at 2:30 p.m.
On Monday, District Court judge Robert L. Wilkins’ nomination to the Federal Court of Appeals became the fourth of Obama’s judicial nominees whose confirmation was blocked by Republicans this year.
Though Democrats control the upper chamber of Congress with 53 senators, they have not been able to muster the 60 votes required to break the Republican filibuster, a procedural tactic designed to prevent an official vote to send nominees to the bench. That confirmation vote would only require a simple majority, which would essentially guarantee the approval of Obama’s picks.
“The Republicans have decided to block all of [Obama’s] nominees, with very few exceptions,” government professor Theda R. Skocpol said. “There might be one or two that squeak through, and it might be Professor Barron, but I can't say if it will be him or if they will end up letting anyone through.”
Republicans voiced few objections to the ideological positions of Wilkins, though debate over previous nominees had centered around divisive political issues such as abortion. “It has always been the case that you’ve got to get bipartisan support for your nominations to the courts because of the filibuster rule in the Senate, which means you have to go to the middle of the political spectrum for your appointments,” government professor Paul E. Peterson said.
Yet regardless of Barron’s ideology, Skocpol said that Republicans seemed to be trying to block all of Obama’s judicial nominees. “The game plan is very clear, and that’s to keep Democrats from getting an imprint on the federal courts,” she said.
Skocpol added that she did not think Republican attempts to block Obama’s nominees would stop any time soon. “It’s not going to change until the Democrats in the Senate get rid of the filibuster rule when it comes to appointments, particularly with judicial nominees,” Skocpol said.
Nevertheless, the White House expressed confidence in the success of their nomination. White House spokesperson Shin Inouye wrote in an email to The Crimson  that the Obama administration “continue[s] to urge the Senate to promptly consider all of the President’s judicial nominees and expect[s] Barron to be confirmed.”
Through a spokesperson, Barron declined to speak about his nomination process, deferring to comment from the White House.
Barron’s colleague at the Law School, Alan M. Dershowitz, also said that he expects the confirmation process to be successful. “He’d be a great judge, and I’m confident that when they look at him on the merits, he’ll be confirmed,” Dershowitz said.
Harvard Law School Dean Martha L. Minow said on Sept. 24 that she hoped the Senate would “promptly” confirm Barron’s nomination, but declined to comment on the confirmation process when asked on Nov. 14.
Barron’s nomination came seven months after University President Drew G. Faust named him to head a task force reviewing the University’s electronic communication policies. Barron told The Crimson earlier this fall that, despite his nomination, he would continue to work on the committee, which is expected to issue an official recommendation to Faust in January.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the voting period for the Undergraduate Council elections underway, the three pairs of candidates vying to become the Council’s next president and vice president faced off in a debate at the John F. Kennedy, Jr. Forum on Monday night.
Though the tickets emphasized their own campaign priorities, Monday night’s debate was marked at times by accord among the candidates. The two serious tickets—C.C. Gong ‘15 and Sietse K. Goffard ‘15, and D.K. Nwokike ‘15 and Una Kim ‘15—both agreed that increased funding for student groups should be a central priority. And joke candidates Sam B. Clark '15 and Gus A. Mayopoulos '15 even managed to find common ground with the other tickets in calling for streamlined connections between the UC and the student body.
The debate, which drew a crowd of about 40 students, began with a question on student group funding, a perennial issue in UC presidential elections. Though its budget has remained stagnant, the UC, which provides funding for the College’s various student organizations, has faced increased demand for funding in recent years.
In their responses, both serious tickets emphasized the need to secure higher levels of funding from the College.
 
Goffard and Gong advocated engaging with high-level administrators to demand increased funding. “If Harvard is going to take pride in its student groups,” Goffard said, “Harvard is going to have to chip in a little.”
For their part, Nwokike and Kim placed emphasis on the UC’s responsibility to provide funding for club sports. Nwokike said that the UC should try to share its responsibility for funding club sports with University Athletics and also suggested changing the name of the $75 “Undergraduate Council Fee” in each student’s tuition bill to the “Student Activities Fee” to clarify exactly how this money will be used and potentially accrue more donations.
Meanwhile, at another point in the night, Clark and Mayopoulos emphasized the need for a different type of funding: money for thicker toilet paper. In a demonstration for the audience, they compared the effects of water on Harvard toilet paper and on Charmin brand toilet paper, showing the audience that the Harvard toilet paper broke faster than the Charmin paper.
The duo spent much of the night satirizing UC politics. At one point, referring to the jokes that he and Clark made throughout the night, Mayopoulos quipped, “A joke is funny because it’s true; it resonates.”
 
Yet the pair highlighted a more serious message when they agreed with the other tickets on the need for greater transparency in interactions between the UC and the student body.
The three tickets also took questions from debate moderator Institute of Politics director C. M. “Trey” Grayson ’94 regarding diversity on campus, the referenda currently on the UC ballot, and the UC’s role in shaping the focus of the Office of Career Services. They also fielded questions from audience members.
Attendee Nelson F. Yanes ‘15 said he thought the debate was “extremely productive,” calling the event “a great way to compare and contrast the issues.”
UC Lowell House Representative Dhruv P. Goyal '16 said the debate changed his perception of Clark and Mayopoulos. “They did expose some shortcomings in the UC,” he said. “I didn’t know they were taking this seriously until now.”

Education professor Howard E. Gardner ’65 and information assistant professor Katie Davis discussed young adults’ increasing dependence on electronic devices at a Cambridge Forum meeting Monday evening at First Parish Church in Harvard Square.
The 90-minute event, which was so crowded that some attendees had to sit in preschool-sized chairs, centered on Gardner and Davis’s new book, “The App Generation,” which was released in October.
Gardner, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education known for his theory of multiple intelligences, and Davis, an assistant professor at the University of Washington Information School, emphasized the dichotomy between what they call “app-enabled” and “app-dependent” young people. Both terms refer to the millions of applications available on smartphones.
A simple test for app dependency, Davis said, is to “see what happens when their phones die.” Although Davis said that she becomes distressed when this happens, people who are not app-dependent are able to cope with losing access to electronic communication.
The duo emphasized identity, intimacy, and imagination as key areas affected by technological dependency for “digital natives.”
Youth perceptions of identity are “increasingly externally oriented,” Davis said, adding that many young people try to craft “desirable images of themselves” on social media websites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
Turning to the supposed loss of intimacy, Gardner said that “people have hundreds of friends… but very few people they feel they can trust.”
He said that the average number of friends Americans confide in has decreased from three to two. He said that this phenomena, though counterintuitive given increased connectivity, may be caused by the decreasing emotional depth of relationships due to constant digital connections.
Finally, Gardner and Davis said that, although apps might foster creativity in specific areas, they are, by nature, limited and prevent creativity from moving outside of bounds created by the developer.
In a segment that they said would be relevant to parents and teachers in the crowd, Gardner and Davis said that they created the term “super app” to describe young adults who see their future as a singular, linear path marked by high achievement.
Such people, Gardner said, “first have to go to the right school, and then they have to go the right college, and then they have to pick the right major….”
During a question-and-answer period at the end of event, many parents expressed concern that their children were on the path to app dependency.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cruising to a first-place finish is by no means an easy task, especially when the fastest collegiate runners in the Northeast are racing to keep their season alive. Co-captain Maksim Korolev of the Harvard cross country team did just that on Friday, as he strode across the finish line at the NCAA Northeast Regionals and watched the remainder of the field finish behind him.
While Korolev’s 10k time of 30:11 at Manhattan College put him seven seconds ahead of the second place finisher, he was only giving the crowd a preview of what to expect next week. Korolev has consistently finished at head of the pack this season and his ability to win races has never been in question.
With no guarantee of a trip to Nationals, Korolev helped Harvard earned an at-large bid to travel to the NCAA Championships, to be held at Indiana State on Saturday. Despite Harvard’s sixth-place overall finish at Regionals, Korolev still managed to lead the team to its fist NCAA Championship appearance in over three decades.
“We’re excited,” Crimson coach Jason Saretsky said. “For the first time since 1979 [we are going to nationals], and that’s a long stretch there. We’ve got a great group of guys going and we’re not satisfied just going there, we’re looking to do something when we’re there.”
At first glance, Korolev’s first-place finish suggests an all-out performance from the senior in what could have been his final race. Although Korolev earned the top time at the meet, he maintained that he could most certainly have run the course at an even faster pace.
“I was just trying to stay conservative,” Korolev said. “I wanted to win, but Coach told me just stay conservative…. The [front] group was together the whole time at a pretty slow pace, and I just put on a burst there at the end to win by a few seconds.”
Nonetheless, the 32-team field selected to compete at Nationals shouldn’t expect the same approach from Korolev come Saturday. Though Korolev still had more in the tank at Regionals, he plans to turn on the burners this weekend.
“Nationals, we are going all out,” Korolev said. “We have eight days between this race and Nationals and it’s the only time we do 10k [races]…. That’s why the strategy was to be conservative at Regionals.”
Normally, Harvard enjoys a two-week period between its 8k races, which allows the runners to rest and prepare. Regionals and Nationals, however, are both 10k races and have only a week of time between them, so the approach is much more demanding and different.
“I’m taking a day off for the first time in a long time this week,” Korolev said. “My workout will be shorter and running a lot less miles, just trying to be fresh for the race.”
Korolev is hoping to earn a top-five finish, as he faces the fastest collegiate runners in the country. But Saretsky has confidence in his veteran’s ability to compete with the best and believes that Korolev has trained and performed well enough to finish among the top runners at Nationals.
“[NCAA Regionals] is an incredibly competitive field that includes the entire Northeast region and some of the best cross country programs in the country,” Sarestky said. “For him to go out there and run that race as relaxed and as confidently as he did really speaks to where he’s at with his training and how much he’s put into this.”
Korolev also set a conference record earlier this year, posting a 23:28.2 to win the Ivy League individual title at the always-competitive Heptagonal Championships in a field 95 runners. Korolev, who earned USTFCCCA All-Region honors this year, will look to keep his spectacular final season alive this weekend, as he enters his final race in a Crimson uniform.
“It’s been a surreal senior season,” Korolev said. “The team making Nationals and beating Yale in the beginning of the year has been amazing and made for a great senior year.”
Korolev has been one of the keys to the Crimson’s success, which beat out league rival Yale earlier this year in its first dual meet and has captured an impressive three top-10 team finishes. Friday’s race was merely confirmation of the captain’s ability to lead Harvard’s program to new heights with his extraordinary speed.

The Harvard coed sailing team finished up its season this weekend with the Atlantic Coast Tournament. The conditions really put a damper on the tournament as only four of the 16 scheduled races actually took place.
Connecticut College hosted 18 teams down on the Thames River in New London in this two-day competition. This intersectional regatta involved “FJs,” a specific type of boat through races across two divisions.
The Crimson failed to qualify for the Atlantic Coast Championship earlier this season, so this weekend’s regatta marked the definitive end for the entire team.
“It was a challenging event with poor racing conditions,” Mollerus said. “We did not preform our best but left with many take-away points on areas where we can improve."
Only four sailors went south to represent Harvard on the water. Sophomores Andrew Mollerus and Sydney Karnovsky paired up for the A division while senior Luke O’Connor joined freshman Julia Lord in the B division boat.
The Crimson finished 14th overall despite its 13th place finishes in both the A and B divisions. There were only four races in total.
The poor weather conditions presented the toughest challenges for the competitors this weekend.
“There was light wind and it rained a lot,” Mollerus said. “There were very unusual conditions and made for a poor racing performance.”
The Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association did not provide more information on the specifics of the conditions, but the sailor’s provided enough emphasis to show their disappointment.
“There wasn't much wind on both Saturday and Sunday,” Karnovsky said. “Due to the lack of wind, most of us had the mentality to just try to enjoy the last weekend as much as possible and sail as well as we could.”
“With poor wind conditions there were a lot of delays in between races, but we did our best to stay ready,” Mollerus said. “We did our best to stay focused and ready.”
Mollerus and Karnovsky finished with 43 points. They finished one rotation in third place, which ultimately would have been Harvard’s lowest score of the weekend.
In the B division, O’Connor and Lord racked in 45 points, with their best race also being the second rotation, where they finished in 7th place.
Besides these two single-digit finishes, the Crimson failed to score lower than the 11th place for any of its other rotations.
“We were sailing on a river, which has a lot more current than we are used to so the water was moving under us much faster,” Mollerus said.
In his opinion, the race starts were the weak point of the weekend as a whole.
“It really changed the dynamics of the starting line because [the strong currents] were something we don’t get in practice very often,” Mollerus added.
Harvard’s strengths on the water this weekend came through with boat-handling, especially in the present conditions.
“We learned a lot of lessons about how to manage and improve our tactful decisions on the water,” Mollerus said.
With this weekend bringing an end to the fall season, the Harvard sailors had plenty to reflect on and take with them heading into winter training and the spring competitions.
Last spring the Crimson carried a young roster of mostly freshmen and sophomores. Now a year older, the sailors attribute the greater success this season to their growing confidence on and off the water.
“This year we returned every starter,” Mollerus said. “We opened up the season very strong, getting the best results we had in years.”
Mollerus gave a shout-out to freshman teammate Juan Perdomo, who qualified for men’s singlehanded nationals for lasers in one of the first weekends of the season. This was the first time a Harvard sailor has accomplished this feat since 2007.
“Later in the season, our results waned a little bit,” Mollerus said. “We definitely did not have the ultimate results that we wanted.”
Despite these disappointing results, the team is optimistic about their chances in the spring season.
“Now that the season's over, I think that the team feels disappointed with the turnout of [Atlantic Coast Championship] qualifiers,” Karnovsky said. “We’re very excited to work on team racing in the upcoming weeks and go into the spring ready to sail well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the end of Saturday’s nail biter over Penn, Harvard coach Tim Murphy had to be wondering if Princeton coach Bob Surace was whispering into the ear of Penn coach Al Bagnoli on some sort of Killer P hotline. After all, the situation was all too familiar for Murphy.
A shutout of his opponent in the first half. A 24-point lead with 10 minutes left in the game. Then, the possibility of losing what was supposed to be a game already locked up. The 2013 Penn game suddenly became eerily similar to the 2012 Princeton contest.
Fortunately for the Crimson, this year’s ending in Cambridge felt much different than the one last year in New Jersey. But the déjà vu fourth-quarter meltdown, which was really more of a second half meltdown after the one Harvard touchdown drive, should be concerning for a team that potentially has a shot at a share of the Ivy title with a win at New Haven next week.
With a 38-0 lead early in the third quarter, Murphy slotted senior quarterback Mike Pruneau in for starter Conner Hempel, a change not altogether uncalled for after the string of Harvard injuries this year.
Pruneau and company immediately punted the ball back after a three-and-out—a pattern that would repeat four more times on each ensuing Harvard drive of the second half, but the Quakers were still eons behind. Not even visible in the rearview mirror. No cause for concern yet.
On Penn’s next drive, defensive end Zach Hodges was doing his customary third-down dance on the field, and it seemed like that, with the lackluster Quakers offense, that might be Hodges’ biggest workout of the day.
Then, Bagnoli did his own QB swap. After going between fifth-year senior playcallers Ryan Becker and Billy Ragone, Bagnoli called up freshman Adam Strouss to line up under center.
Strouss, normally called on for option plays, attempted his only pass of the day, but that play—a 26-yard completion to Ben Challgren—seemed to rouse a sleepy Penn offense to begin what was almost a comeback for the ages.
A 15-yard facemask penalty on the next play moved the Quakers inside the red zone for the first time all day, and one fourth-down conversion later, Strouss broke the plane of the end zone. Just like that, Penn was on the scoreboard for the first time. 7-0 Penn run.
Then the points began pouring on. The next drive looked almost identical to the previous one—another 15-yard penalty (this one for roughing the passer) moved the Quakers down the field, and Becker converted another fourth down at almost exactly the same spot before Strouss ran in another 1-yard touchdown. 14-0 Penn run.
Now up by just 24 with nearly the entire fourth quarter left, the Crimson continued conservative play. Penn got the ball back less than 90 seconds later and didn’t need any fourth-down conversions to find the end zone this time. Becker connected with a fellow Ryan in Ryan Ripp for the two-point conversion to make it a two-possession game with eight minutes left. 22-0 Penn run.
At this point, Murphy, remembering the 2012 collapse, asked Hempel to re-enter the game. But much like Penn’s own QB swaps in the first half, this did little for Harvard’s struggling offense.
The Crimson came close to a first down, short just inches after measurement. While hanging onto a two-point lead with under two minutes to go against Princeton last year, Murphy elected to punt in a similar fourth-and-short situation.
Up by 16 with seven minutes to go, Murphy made the same decision. Less than three minutes later, Penn cut that lead to eight. 30-0 Penn run.
The following Harvard drive returned the ball to the Quakers just 52 seconds later, but a booming David Bicknell punt meant that Becker now had to move his team 70 yards down the field.
And yet, it seemed inevitable that Penn would somehow miraculously put together another drive to tie the game.
Indeed, the second half—which, with the exception of the first drive that had resulted in the only Crimson points of the half—was all Penn. And it seemed it would stay that way when the Harvard defense would force a fourth down, but the ball would somehow find its way into a Penn receiver’s hands to keep the drive alive.
But luck ran just short for Al Bagnoli’s team. With Penn trying to convert its third fourth-down conversion of the drive at the Harvard 20-yard line with 27 seconds left, Harvard captain Josh Boyd tipped Becker’s ball just out of reach. It was the only drive of the second half that Penn did not reach the end zone. And suddenly, Hempel was kneeling down, and the comeback was over.
After the game, Bagnoli described the comeback as “flipping a switch,” and he couldn’t have been more accurate. Penn had just 56 yards of offense in the first half, but ended with over 300 to finish the game. It was as though an entirely different Penn squad came out of halftime.
But the lights came on for Penn too little, too late. In 2012, Princeton scored 29 straight to upset Harvard. In 2013, Penn scored 30 straight. This year, 30 points wasn’t enough, and the Crimson escaped its final game at home with a win.

In anticipation of the upcoming Harvard-Yale game, we at Flyby thought we'd put together a quick quiz so you can get to know your enemy a little better. It turns out there are some hidden treasures over there! See if you can figure out a few fun facts about some of the Yale football team. Good luck!

As we approach Thanksgiving and Harvard’s inevitable seventh consecutive win against Yale in the Harvard-Yale football game, it seems like a good time to reflect upon a few other reasons why we’re grateful not to have to spend four years in New Haven.

BraveryWe’ll admit, it takes a lot of guts to sign your soul away to Yale for four years. However, that doesn’t mean you should go and make a video about it. Some Yale students recently choreographed and lip-synced to to Sara Bareilles’ “Brave”. "Oh, how creative!" you may be thinking, but in reality the video is just a hard-to-watch display of misery and flailing around—exactly what one would expect, really. Check out Harvard’s recent admissions video to see the result of competent video editing and students who don’t secretly despise their school.LocationGreeting those drive along the I-95 to reach our New Haven friends there is a sign that reads "Yale University: Exit 3". We can't be sure, but we think we saw the faintest of Sharpie marks scratched underneath that read "Please help us. Please."Clean LaundryWe could go on to enumerate the span of what makes Harvard better than Yale, but we’ll conclude with this: whenever we move our laundry from the washer to the dryer, we cherish the knowledge that, at Harvard, we have no reason to fear for the hygienic sanctity of our clothing. No feces—just the fresh scent of Downy and warm pairs of jeans.Go Harvard. Beat Yale. Enough said.

Kanye West stopped by the Graduate School of Design on Sunday night to share some words of wisdom—or maybe just words—with a crowd of students before he and Kim Kardashian headed to the Boston stop of the "Yeezus" tour. Here's what Flyby learned from his visit.
 
Everything can be "architected."According to Kanye, anything can be architected. That's right, anything. That's his justification, at least, for employing architects to design t-shirts for his creative agency, DONDA. We expect the GSD to announce a new course, "STU 232: The Structural Integrity of T-Shirts" any day now. Unfortunately, it seems that the creativity of these architects might not translate so well in Kanye's t-shirt biz, judging by the stunning originality (not) of his $120 plain white tee and his confederate flag shirt.
Utopia is possible... Therefore Kanye is politically incorrect.Kanye cemented his belief that "like, utopia is actually possible," and claimed the only thing holding society back from it are the leaders, who are "the least noble, the least dignified, the least tasteful, the dumbest, and the most political." He continued his logic to say he is "in no way a politician—I'm usually at my best politically incorrect and very direct." So there, next time Kanye makes some ridiculously offensive and inconsiderate comment, just remember he's doing it to create a utopia.
 
People who work in offices stink.Kanye complained about "people in offices" who "stop the creative people, and [who] are intimidated by actual good ideas." Maybe that's why Kanye hates Obama so much these days. That’s the real problem with the President, the oval office keeps holding him back.
Kanye does in fact get embarrassed.Kanye admitted that he does sometimes get "self conscious," and not about the things you might expect (you know, embarrassing pop stars at awards ceremonies, various rants, underwhelming fashion endeavors—we could go on). No, not even his poorly designed t-shirts or publicity nightmares give him pause, but showing the concert stage to a bunch of students from the Graduate School of Design does. "The stage does have flaw in it," he said. "It's an expression of emotion so give me a pass on that." Don't worry, Kanye: after the free tickets you handed out, we will let the architectural flaws in the stage slide, no problem.
 
Famous people talk to other famous people.As if we didn't already know this as Kanye and Kim strolled into the GSD. Kanye wasted no time in name-dropping Oprah in his remarks. We get it, Kanye, you and Oprah are buds. If you’d taken a leaf out of her book and given away free cars, people may have been more excited by this.

UPDATED: Nov. 20, 2013 at 1:13 p.m.
From the very beginning, everything they did suggested that their campaign would be off the beaten path, transcending traditional campaign elements of polished rhetoric, calculated strategies, and grand promises.
 
Samuel B. Clark ’15 and Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 promise a new era of leadership and ambition, fueled by an unorthodox approach that threatens to challenge our notions of student-led politics. Their campaign departs from the classic formality and gravitas espoused by traditional political candidates. Centered on the promises of tomato basil ravioli soup served daily in the dining halls, thicker toilet paper for all, and “divesting from gender neutral weekend shuttles,” the campaign addresses issues commonly ignored by College leaders.
Flyby met up with the candidates to get their opinions on some of these oft-ignored issues.
 
Flyby: So the question that has been on our minds for quite some time now, um…crunchy or creamy peanut butter?Clark: Creamy, obviously.Mayopoulos: Crunchy.Clark: Oh. This signifies our difference on this point…signifies that we have differences of opinion, but we, uh, we stick together.Mayopoulos: You can eat crunchy peanut butter with the spoon straight out of the jar and not feel bad about yourself because there’s texture there besides just, like, butter.Clark: I never feel bad about myself when I eat creamy peanut butter out of the jar, even if it is all of the jar.
 
Flyby: How about Nutella?Clark: It’s…Nutella’s perfect.Mayopoulos: Nutella’s in that vending machine. Do you even buy jars?[Points to vending machine in background]Clark: Holy…fuck me.Mayopoulos: Right?Flyby: Capitalism.Mayopoulos: It’s a little sweet to me.Clark: You know, yeah, and that shows I think I’m a little…I’m a little sweeter, I’m a little creamier, and Gus is a little crunchier.
 
Flyby: Does this describe your relationship?Clark: Certainly describes our relationship, certainly describes our candidacy, certainly describes our, uh, pillow talk?Mayopoulos: Pillow talk. Yeah.
Flyby: This goes for either of you. Tell us a joke.Clark: As we said earlier…Mayopoulos: This is not a joke.Clark: …it’s difficult to define a joke…Mayopoulos: Goddamn. It just…Clark: Except in a dictionary.Mayopoulos: Alright.Clark: He’s got…Gus has jokes.Mayopoulos: Wait. I have this one. Hang on, hang on. Just give me one sec. Hang on. All of them I can think of cannot be published in the Crimson.Flyby: It’s Flyby.Mayopoulos: Wait, wait, wait, so… [Pause] What do you call a guy with no arms and no legs in a pool?[Looks at Sam]Mayopoulos: Bob.[Laughter]Clark: Oh! Laughs. Poor guy.[Laughter.] 
Flyby: All right.Mayopoulos: Oh god.Flyby: Biggest role models in your guys’ lives?Clark: Physically?Flyby: Interpret as you wish.Clark: Chris Christie.Mayopoulos: Yeah.Clark: Biggest role models.[Clark and Mayopoulos whisper to each other]Clark: Okay. Count of three?[Looks at Gus]Clark: My biggest role model is Gus Mayopoulos.Flyby: Is that...the same for you?Mayopoulos: Mine is also Gus Mayopoulos.Flyby: Why?Mayopoulos: Nobody can buy…Clark: He’s great!Mayopoulos: He’s crunchy…Clark: He’s crunchyMayopoulos: He tells off-color jokes…Clark: He tells off-color jokes…he…he, um, can grow a beard, like, really fast and it will be like a full beard. That’s one thing that I’ve been trying to do but just can’t, is like grow a beard.
 
Flyby: So, boxers or briefs? Justify your answer. Important question, because there’s really transparency in this whole process.Clark: Boxers because freedom.Mayopoulos: Why not both? There’s safety in numbers.
 
Flyby: I don’t know if you guys saw the Flyby article...there’s an article about dream UC tickets. They have their #1 as David Ortiz and Tom Brady. Could you beat them?Clark: Jesus. I don’t even know what sport David Ortiz plays.Mayopoulos: He’s, uh, Red Sox. This is our fucking city.Clark: Oh, that guy? We can certainly not beat them in a match of physical, uh, prowess.Mayopoulos: I don’t think it matters…Clark: We can certainly not beat them at anything.Mayopoulos: Except for the UC election.Clark: Except for the UC election. The reason being that neither of them are Harvard students and are thus ineligible.
 
Flyby: Advice to freshmen. Biggest piece of advice you could give.Mayopoulos: Don’t…just don’t…Well, I would say stocking up on toilet paper, since you never know when you’re going to need some, and…[Clark snaps]Clark: Stock up on toilet paper. And, in all seriousness, don’t be afraid to switch concentrations. Like, it will seem like, oh my God, everything you ever knew is coming apart right now, but you’ll actually be happier if you just go for it, and you’d be surprised how many of these things just work out. Yeah, I’ve switched my concentration…how many times did I switch my concentration? Once?Mayopoulos: No, Sam, that was socks.

Amidst all the posting of flyers and the creation of facebook prof pic templates, it may seem hard for UC presidential candidates to take a moment to laugh. But in order to understand the candidates better, we at Flyby think it's important to get a better sense of their pop culture prefernces and hear more about their daily lives. Flyby sat down with Chika-Dike O. Nwokike '15 and Una Kim '15 to do just that.
Flyby: What are your hobbies?Nwokike: I like photography, playing basketball, working out, mentoring, and I love looking at men’s fashion blogs.Kim: I like singing, dancing to K-Pop, board games, and the game Mafia.
 
 
Flyby: What is your campaign theme song?Nwokike: Anything by Kanye West works for me. I need something I could get amped to.Kim: Lately I’m into Ylvis. I like all their other songs, they’re really good at singing.
 
Flyby: What is one word that describes your partner?Nwokike: Una is understanding. She’s someone who’s easy to work with, and she doesn’t lose sight at end of the day.Kim: DK is genuine, very honest, and upright.
 
Flyby: What’s one word that describes you?Nwokike: Handsome.Kim: Spontaneous.
 
Flyby: What superhero would you like to be or what superpower would you like to have?Nwokike: I love Naruto so much. He wanted to lead because wanted to be connected to his community, and people really confided in his strength and leadership. Eventually he dies but his spirit never dies. That will to keep going on is amazing to see.Kim: I would want to speak every language in world. When you’re naturally fluent at a language, you really understand its culture too.
  
Flyby: What’s your favorite thing about Harvard?Nwokike: Probably the amount of celebrities that visit.*Kim: I love Housing Day and House spirit because it is unique to Harvard and fosters great community. I would love to implement a Harvard-wide Hunger Games-style event, with two people representing each House, but maybe with water guns instead.
*Nwokike has reportedly fist-bumped everyone from President Faust to John Legend to Mark Zuckerburg.
 
Flyby: What is your favorite thing about the UC?Nwokike: I admire its multifaceted membership. There are so many admirable people on the Council.Kim: Lots of people lack the general feel of political efficacy, but I feel inspired and impressed by the passion of students on the UC to invoke changes and bring ideas to the forefront.
