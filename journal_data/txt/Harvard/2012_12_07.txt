After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Serena Frome, the main character of Ian McEwan’s new novel, “Sweet Tooth,” reads constantly, speeding through two to three novels per week. McEwan presents his readers with extracts from those novels: thus in reading “Sweet Tooth,” one gets much more than just Serena’s story. We read what she reads too, sifting through layers of narration to find what is true in all of the fiction. The most intriguing part of McEwan’s new work is the slippery sense that no narrator can be trusted as the reader tries to separate Serena’s story from the fiction that surrounds her. By weaving story upon fictional story, McEwan manages to trap his reader in a web of meta-narration that is at once exciting and unsettling.
“I was the basest of readers,” Serena says in one such metanarrative moment. “All I wanted was my own world, and myself in it, given back to me in artful shapes and accessible form.” What Serena wants is to see herself in a fiction story, which is exactly what a reader of McEwan’s novel gets; we read versions of Serena in the stories written by Tom Haley, another character. Serena meets Haley while she is working on a mission for the Civil Service, a subset of the British parliament similar to the C.I.A., in London. Serena is chosen for her enormous range of literary knowledge to follow and support the work of Tom Haley. She eventually falls in love with Haley, but only after learning to love his fiction. Here, McEwan decides that the reader should get a taste of Haley’s writing with Serena, and so he weaves Haley’s writing directly into Serena’s narration. Haley’s words are in italics next to Serena’s interpretation of the story so that both McEwan’s and the fictional Haley’s words are seamlessly fused in the novel.
When Serena first encounters Haley’s work, she is struck by how closely she identifies with the characters in the story. While reading, she pauses on an asterisk in the middle of Haley’s story to imagine the directions it might take. “I stared into it to prevent my gaze slipping down the page and revealing the author’s next move,” Serena says. Her consciousness is our own; until Serena decides to move on and read the rest of the story, we will not know the ending. Serena has an unbelievable amount of control over our knowledge, and she chooses to tell only certain parts of her story, leaving the rest to the bits of Haley’s fiction that intrude into her voice. At this moment of introspection, when Serena stares at the asterisk, McEwan gives his readers a pause to consider the changeable relationship between details in Haley’s story and Serena’s own untrustworthy voice. Then, both Serena and McEwan dive back in, immersing the reader back into another level of storytelling and eliminating the brief reprieve in the confusing mix of realities.
When Serena thinks about herself, she judges her own actions as harshly as if she were another narrator, again adding to the unsettling nature of the narration. She makes note of her own dependency on others, her confusion while working at the Civil Service, and her insecurities about being qualified for her job. When Serena is at work, she is constantly unsure of whom to trust. Her colleagues are tittering office girls with more brains than they let on; girls who are perfectly willing to reveal Serena’s unprofessional approach to her assignments.
“Sweet Tooth” is set in the midst of the cold war in England, an already paranoid setting which compliments the odd nature of the multi-voiced narration. Serena navigates her way through the British Civil Service office, agreeing to work on a case called Sweet Tooth. Her mission is to encourage the writing of Tom Haley, a writer chosen by the British government for his anti-communist fiction. She goes undercover, self-consciously dropping lies as she provides money from the government to support Haley while he writes what is supposed to be the next great pro-capitalist novel for the good of democracy. But she fails, fumbles, and embarrasses herself by the end. Up until the final pages of the novel, McEwan maintains the curious metanarrative, and the mixing of Serena’s own story with the words of Tom Haley, but McEwan’s conclusion stifles that unique narration.
“No single element of an imagined world or any of its characters should be allowed to dissolve on authorial whim,” says Serena earlier in the novel. At the time, Serena meant to direct the opinion at Haley’s writing when one of his fiction stories ended by revealing another character whom had been “writing” the story the whole time. But the distaste for authorial whims might also be applied to the reader of McEwan’s novel, and not merely the story-within-the-story that Serena recounts in her narration. The end of “Sweet Tooth” casts the whole proceeding story in a new light, and one that is perhaps too kitschy and unfulfilling. If the best parts of the novel are McEwan’s interesting fusion of narrative voices, he negates his interesting style in the space of a few pages.
McEwan devotees will see a similarity between the endings of “Sweet Tooth” and that of “Atonement,” but McEwan does not pull off “Sweet Tooth” as gracefully as he finished “Atonement.” McEwan’s precise and piercing language remains in his most recent novel, but the structure and narrative choices do not hold all the way through to the end.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This Tuesday The New York Times ran an article on student demand for divestment from fossil fuel companies. In the article, Harvard was cited as remaining firm in its stance to continue its current investment strategies. The university’s refusal to rethink the fate of its $31 billion—despite a 72 percent majority vote on the Undergraduate Council referendum—has a number of people understandably upset.
Initially, I was one of divestment’s biggest proponents. However, I realized that the voices in the debate had been primarily those of students. To paint a complete picture, I was curious to hear from faculty and alumni, who may have greater perspective on the effectiveness of movements of political opposition.
Bill E. McKibben ’82, environmental activist, author, and former Crimson president, has not been shy about criticizing his alma mater for resisting giving into the divestment trend set by many other colleges across the country.
In response to the college’s decision not to consider divesting, McKibben wrote to me in an email: “Don't be disappointed by the first no—it's as predictable as the first robin of spring in Harvard Yard. It needs to be the start, not the end of the campaign. It just means the fight is on.”
He cited the student body’s consensus in a widespread email to subscribers of 350.org, an international organization dedicated to solving climate change, as well as in an op-ed for The Boston Globe this past Sunday, both of which reach millions around the world. If his goal is to focus the attention on Harvard, his efforts are working.
In this debate, McKibben’s is not the only voice to be reckoned with. Daniel P. Schrag, Harvard Professor and adviser on science and technology for President Obama, disagrees with McKibben’s views, maintaining that, rather than pulling funds away from fossil-fuel companies, the university should focus its efforts around what it does best: teaching students and conducting research.
“If we’re going to mobilize student opinion,” he told me, “I want to do it in a really intelligent way. Only a tiny fraction of all universities’ cumulative endowment is invested in energy.” He made the convincing argument that rebuilding the economy of the world to support a more sustainable future does not come from divesting, but rather investing in research and development to explore new technologies.
Schrag also noted that fossil fuel companies—with already accreted power and capital—will likely be leaders in clean energy once technology becomes more widely available. After talking with him, I was a bit less certain about my previous unwavering stance. It turns out the most effective way of initiating change is not as clear as I thought.
Marshall L. Ganz '60, Harvard Kennedy School professor of public policy and social change movements, also acknowledges the difficulties that come with trying to influence something as powerful as the fossil fuel industry. “When you try to out-lobby Goliath, you have to find other tools from which you can generate enough power to deal with opposition, to have the chance of making a change,” he said. “Divestment has varied in how effective a tactic it’s been.”
However, he was optimistic about students’ ability to rally around a cause and make, if not a financial impact, at least a symbolic one. Movements must pass a certain threshold before they spur significant transformations. McKibben and Ganz both drew the parallel between divestment from fossil fuels and divestment from South Africa during apartheid. While the university was also hesitant to divest at that time, the action eventually became a common tactic for making political statements.
“The University is not only a source of wealth, but also has a moral standing in the broader community,” said Ganz.
I don’t understand economics well enough to know whether divestment makes fiscal sense or not. I’m doubtful fossil fuel companies will care about thousands or even millions of dollars, when the net worth of Exxon Mobil is over $400 billion. What I do know is that we, as students with access to a world-class education, have to do something—and do it wisely.
There has been a lack of discussion on campus surrounding our consumption habits and, if nothing else, this divestment campaign brings some much-needed attention to the fact that we, as educated Americans, consume more than anyone else in the world—ten times more than every Chinese person, for example. We have to start talking about how our needs compare with our wants. We have to start talking about our motives for desiring such a high standard of living. Once we’re done talking, we have to act.
Climate change is not as “easily” fixed as apartheid, as we have already likely permanently disrupted the carbon cycle. While there will undoubtedly be complications along the road, that shouldn’t stop us from embracing this challenge. I believe divestment will play an important role in the coming stages of the movement towards sustainability, but mostly insofar as it shifts common discourse to one of a greener nature. Whether your economic policies agree with divestment or not, let us not let differences in opinion prevent us from demanding change.
“I agree with the outrage,” said Schrag. “I’m not satisfied with the status quo—part of me wants to march in front of Massachusetts Hall and protest. But it’s not just Exxon Mobil that’s the problem; we’re the problem.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before Thanksgiving Break, Harvard students made history as the first college to have a referendum on fossil fuel divestment. During the UC election, 72 percent of voting students supported the campaign calling on Harvard to divest from the top 200 publicly traded companies that own the majority of the world’s fossil fuel reserves. The divestment campaign, spearheaded by Divest Harvard, began on campus just at the beginning of this semester. By now, Harvard is one of over one hundred campuses around the country in this growing movement.
 
 In the coming weeks, Divest Harvard will focus on building a coalition of responsibility. We want the other key stakeholders in our university community to join with students in asking the administration to withdraw economic support from an industry that threatens all of our futures. We want to see the immense economic, intellectual, and moral power of our university used to question the fossil fuel industry’s reckless behavior.   
 
 President Faust has said that she does not feel compelled to divest at this time because Harvard only divests in “extreme circumstances.” Yet research sponsored by 20 governments around the world suggests that climate change is already causing 400,000 deaths per year, and fossil fuel usage is expected to cause 100 million deaths over the next 18 years. A new report from the World Bank shows that our world will warm over 4 degrees Celsius if society does not reign in carbon emissions—and the effects would threaten civilization as we know it. Harvard divested from genocide in Darfur, Big Tobacco, and apartheid in South Africa for human health and social justice reasons. Climate science, to which many of our own faculty have contributed, now indicates a scenario of the utmost gravity, should we remain on course with current levels of carbon extraction. There is hardly a more “extreme” set of circumstances imaginable. 
 
 As our coalition gathers strength, there will be arguments made against divestment. These arguments should be carefully considered in order to understand their merits and shortfalls. For example, Jane Mendillo, the CEO of the Harvard Management Company, has indicated that Harvard investment decisions are already subjected to screening criteria based upon environmental, social, and governance considerations. We invite Ms. Mendillo to share her screening methodology with the wider community. We know that Harvard’s money is invested in Petrobras, which holds a monopoly on oil production in Brazil and is a leader in deep-water oil drilling. It is also invested in Vale S.A., which in the 2012 Public Eye Awards was voted the most evil company in the world.  It would be helpful to understand what kind of framework of environmental and social criteria give passing grades to the practices of such companies so that we can work together to strengthen the screening process. 
 
Another argument has been made that divestment could cost our endowment approximately $7.5 million in annual returns. If we ignore the likelihood of making up for this shortfall through other investments, this would be a legitimate argument. However, the effects of global warming will cost immensely more than that. Boston—according to sea level rise projections—is a hotspot for the destructive consequences of the rising oceans.  The Boston Globe reported that “officials have begun mapping low-lying areas and critical systems that are most likely to be inundated. The maps show that if sea levels rise just 2.5 feet, it could take little more than a Nor’easter to put much of the Back Bay, East Boston, South Boston, Chelsea, Cambridge, and elsewhere underwater, including much of Logan International Airport and the financial district.” The destructive impact from Sandy has been estimated at more than $50 billion dollars for New York. Storms like Sandy will only become more powerful and frequent as the Earth warms. What will it cost the university if it can no longer exist near the banks of the Charles River? 
 
 At the heart of many other arguments against divestment is the assumption that the devastating consequences of carbon extraction are—and will remain—external to the balance sheets of the fossil fuel companies. Let’s recall that the concept of externalities as a moving target. A century ago, companies could endanger their workers, and the costs were considered external to the balance sheet. With increased regulation of labor practices, from wages to Occupational Health and Safety to health benefits, what was once external is now accepted as within the financial and social obligations of the corporation. As Americans experience more monster storms, droughts, and wildfires, the reckless practices of the fossil fuel industry will be challenged. These companies will be required to take financial responsibility for the consequences of their actions, at which point the value of their stocks will plummet. 
 
 Divest Harvard aims to create a coalition of the responsibility and establish Harvard University as a beacon in this historic struggle against global warming. We want to engage with arguments against divestment and educate the community about the importance of the movement. Our courage and moral vision can send an urgent message to allies near and far that the time has come to stand together in a new coalition of responsibility.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is nearly Christmastime, which signals the forthcoming period of too many sweets, a host of Oscar-worthy movies, and, for those who stay in tune with politics after the November election, a contentious bit of political theatre. This year, the drama revolves around the fiscal cliff, an ominous increase in taxes and draconian spending cuts that would go into law if a compromise is not reached in the weeks ahead. Thus far, most of the action has focused on Speaker of the House John A. Boehner and potential concessions he and his Republican colleagues would be willing to make in order to prevent the worst possible outcome. However, President Obama has now reasserted himself as a major actor in the process. Unfortunately, he did so in a perfidious manner that could harm the American democratic spirit for years to come.
Fans of Washington dramaturgy surely remember the crisis that befell Washington last summer, when Congress threatened not to raise the debt ceiling, the limit on the amount of bonds the government can issue to finance its liabilities. The debt ceiling is back in the news, as the president has criticized Congress’s ability to wield such a powerful weapon. As we saw last year, the majority of the House has demonstrated an inclination to refuse to raise the ceiling, unless they reach a budgetary bargain consisting of tax and spending cuts. The president has expressed frustration with this aspect of governance and has proposed ridding the ability to control the debt ceiling from Congress’ arsenal. Such a scheme reflects brazen presidential overreach and would be deleterious to the American process of compromise.
It is not difficult to understand why the president wants control over the debt ceiling all to himself. After all, it has been shown to be an incredibly puissant armament. But Congress’s possession of it is strictly outlined in Article I Section 8 of the Constitution, wherein “The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States.” Nowhere in Article II, which lays out the powers of the executive branch and the president, would one be able to find any reference to paying off the debt. Congress holds sole responsibility for the nation’s finances, while the president’s role is primarily military.
Although it is admirable of the president to desire swift compromise, such is not the nature of the governing process. The Founding Fathers so kindly gave us three branches of government for a reason: so that there can be heated debate and eventual compromise. Removing the need for compromise would set too much power in one post: that of the presidency. Discourse over the country’s bills is only healthy, especially since the topic had been ignored for so long.
Bestowing control over the debt ceiling to one individual would set a remarkably dangerous precedent. How much a government can and should borrow and spend is an incredibly important issue. It is not when that should be taken lightly, even by someone with an electoral mandate. While voters obviously express their preferences by voting for president, they also elect the Congress. Ignoring their preferences would be a sign of grave disrespect for the citizens of this nation.
While Congress can obviously deny Obama’s power grab, doing so would undoubtedly warrant a presidential veto. If that were to happen, it is likely that the president’s allies would work against the interests of their governing body and fight any attempt at override it. This would be a mistake similar to if the Democrats in Congress were to enact comprehensive filibuster reform. While such actions would give them advantages in controlling the Senate and the White House, it would put them at a disadvantage at the time Republicans inevitably come back to power. Unless they think they have captured a permanent majority (which after 2008, they believed that they had), they would be wise not to give substantially more power to the Oval Office.
It is likely that the president will ultimately get his way, if not by passing this measure of overreach, then by scaring off Republicans from their demands. This is an unfortunate sequence of events for a president who has already demonstrated a willingness to exceed the powers of his forebears: It is dangerous enough that one man controls what enemies to target in drone strikes. America would do best to remember the spirit of compromise and keep Congress, as well as the president, in the room to discuss the nation’s credit card.

Last week brought good news for Harvard’s newly reinstated early action program. Compared with 2011, there was a 39 percent increase in requests for application fee waivers, suggesting an uptick in the amount of low- and middle-income applicants. What’s more, African-American early applicants were up 22 percent and Native Americans 24 percent from 2011. Considering that early action is often thought to favor students from privileged backgrounds who have the resources to get a head start on the college application process, the apparent increase in applicant diversity is a welcome development. Indeed, it is possible that with deliberate attention to recruiting early applicants from a diverse array of backgrounds, the College may be able to avoid one of the main pitfalls of an early admissions system.
Yet when the College discontinued the early action program in 2006, inequality was just one of two main concerns. The other was that an early admissions system, in the words of Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67, “subverts” the college admissions process, forcing students to try to gain an edge by applying early rather than thinking critically about which school is the best fit for them. Fitzsimmons even acknowledged the added pressure on students from elite public and private schools, who are deprived of several potentially important months of thought on where to apply.
But unfortunately, Harvard cannot continue as a regular action school in an early action world. Along with Princeton and the University of Virginia, Harvard had hoped that eliminating early action in 2006 would lead others to follow suit. Yet none did, and Harvard Admissions likely felt that they were losing some of the best candidates to places like Yale and Stanford, who kept their early programs.
In light of the current prevalence of early action, Harvard has no choice but to play along. But it’s clear enough that we’d all be better off if America’s top universities dropped the system altogether. It’s possible that concerns of inequality can be surmounted with a substantial dedication of resources to recruiting applicants from all rungs of the socio-economic ladder. Yet the distortion in student decision-making that occurs because of system is impossible to get around. It robs high school seniors of the freedom of choice that comes with not having to weigh concerns of early versus regular admissions when deciding which schools to apply to.
At the end of the day, we are more supportive of Harvard’s early action program than ever in light of the recent numbers. However, we acknowledge that applicants everywhere would be better off if we all just had until January to submit our applications.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison discussed the divide between good and evil in 19th and 20th-century literature and her own writing in Sanders Theater Thursday afternoon.
Morrison’s lecture was part of the Harvard Divinity School’s Ingersoll Lecture on Immortality, an annual tradition that is more than a century old and has included William James and Stephen Gould among its lecturers.
Morrison was introduced by Divinity School Professor Davíd Carrasco, one of her personal friends. The winner of the 1988 Pulitzer Prize for her novel Beloved, the 1993 Nobel Prize in Literature, and the 2012 Presidential Medal of Freedom, Morrison now serves as a professor at Princeton University.
Morrison opened her lecture by describing a school shooting that took place in an Amish community in 2006. The shooting was unique because the community responded by forgiving the killer and embracing his family, rather than judging him for his actions or seeking retribution.  This incident, she said, drew her attention to the concept of goodness: what constitutes it and what its origin may be.
Morrison suggested three manifestations of goodness: as an act of selflessness that can be taught and learned; as narcissism driven by a desire to think well of oneself; and as an inherent, embedded gene.  No discussion of goodness is complete, she added, without a consideration of evil.
“Evil has a blockbuster audience; goodness lurks backstage,” Morrison said.  She added that while many 19th-century writers ended their stories with the triumph of virtue, writers of the 20th century were masters at exposing the frailty and comedy of goodness in their work.
“Goodness must have a strong impact on a novel’s structure and meaning,” she said, adding that she tries to depict goodness this way in her own writing.
“What struck me the most was one line about how evil is given vivid voice where goodness bites its tongue,” said Katie L. LaRoche, a student at the Divinity School.  “She made me contemplate decisions I’ve made in the past where I’ve bitten my tongue, not done what was right.”
“Very few times in life do you get the opportunity to sit and be present in front of greatness,” said Manikka L. Bowman, who attended the lecture with a friend.  “I had that experience tonight, and it was very powerful.”

Ninety-four students were officially recognized Thursday afternoon as mid-year graduates of Harvard College at the Graduate Recognition Ceremony in the Radcliffe Gymnasium. The event, hosted by the Senior Class Committee, featured a series of speeches that called for innovation, unconventionality, and responsibility in the world beyond Harvard.
Setting the thematic tone for the event, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds cited the poem “The Road Not Taken” by Robert Frost and praised the graduates for taking the “road less traveled.” She celebrated previous Harvard students Mark E. Zuckerberg and Matt Damon for “forging their own paths by leaving university before they finished,” and advocated for the outgoing group to “innovate, make discoveries, shape fields, and forge new ideas of success.”
History professor James T. Kloppenberg called on the students to thank and reach out to anyone responsible for their Harvard experience. Kloppenberg said that Harvard students would face the struggle of finding “a life of meaning, value, and purpose” but that he hoped Harvard’s liberal arts education could help bring them closer to that discovery.
“I hope your Harvard education will help you to solve those Tolstoy questions—what shall we do and how shall we live?” Kloppenberg said.
Andrew Berry, lecturer in organismic and evolutionary biology, then described the graduates as “‘the road less traveled’ people” and suggested that they could learn from the choices of renowned naturalist Charles Darwin. Berry recommended that graduates stay in touch with Harvard mentors, faculty, and professors—just as Darwin did with his contemporaries.
“The most important part of Harvard is not p-sets but the people you hang out with. Networks were a powerful driving force for Darwin,” he said. “Every enterprise is a collaborative enterprise and you should remember that.”
Yi Han ’12 concluded the event with a speech about a contemporary world “that demands leaders who can maintain autonomy and visionaries who are not afraid to be the minority.” He encouraged his peers to go and “move some mountains.”
Many of the graduates attended a reception in the gymnasium after the speeches.
“It’s nice seeing people that really care about you and makes you value your time at Harvard,” said Christopher K. Lee ’12.
Lee took time off to do anthropology research on food and culture in Hong Kong—an experience funded by Harvard.
“I would not trade that experience with anything else,” he said.

More than half a century after Joseph E. Murray made history by conducting the first successful human organ transplant in 1954, he drove for four hours to attend the funeral of an old patient—the man who had donated his kidney in that original surgery.
When he arrived at the funeral, Murray was welcomed like a member of the donor’s family, according to Stefan G. Tullius, an associate professor of surgery at Harvard Medical School who accompanied his former colleague Murray to the services that day.
Friends and family say that gestures like these were typical of Murray, who cared deeply about his patients long after they left the operation room.
Murray, who won a Nobel Prize in medicine in 1990 and made breakthroughs in transplant surgery over his long career as a Harvard Medical School professor, died on Nov. 26 in Boston at age 93.
“He recognized that surgery was treating a human being,” said his son Richard Murray. “He was helping a life become more fulfilling and worth living.”
Born and raised in Milford, Mass., Murray studied classics at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass., before graduating from Harvard Medical School in 1943.
Following a stint as a doctor in the Army Medical Corps, Murray began working at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, now known as Brigham and Women’s. After experimenting with early transplant operations on dogs, Murray went on to make advancements in human organ transplants, burn procedures, and cranial-facial reconstructive surgeries.
Colleagues remembered Murray for his humanistic approach and positive attitude, even in stressful moments.
“He always looked at things in an infectiously optimistic way, which made it much easier to communicate with him and to approach difficult situations,” Tullius said.
Murray was especially optimistic about the future of medicine, according to Harvard Medical School instructor Edward J. Caterson, who worked with Murray at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
“From my perspective, what was most impressive about Joe Murray was that, despite immense intellectual capacity, he still was a humble man who was enthusiastic about progress, about young people entering science and medicine,” Caterson said.
Family members said that Murray exhibited this same positivity outside the operating room.
“We would tease him mercilessly about always seeing the bright side,” chuckled Murray’s son Richard. “Dad would be burning up, and he’d say, ‘At least I’m warm.’”
Richard recalled a moment around the Thanksgiving dinner table just days before his father died, when Murray told his wife Virginia of 67 years, “You get prettier every year.”
Friends and family members said that Murray’s philosophy was informed by his devout Catholic faith, which helped him see the whole patient and not just the organ he was transplanting. In Murray’s view, one could save a life by improving it.
“He would see each patient as if they were his own sons and daughters because, in his view, we are all sons and daughters in the eyes of our Creator,” Richard said.
Richard said he will deeply miss his father’s kindness, insight, and warmth.
“We knew this day was going to come and it wasn’t going to come in twenty years, but that doesn’t make it a heck of a lot easier,” Richard said. “With a guy like this, there’s just conversations I already want to have with him that I can’t.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Those walking by the Carpenter Center Thursday afternoon might have heard what sounded like music coming from the roof of the building.
The music is a part of “Unreal Memories,” a sonic installation by Hans Tutschku on the Carpenter Center’s roof.
The piece does not look like much—three objects, scattered, comprise the space. The installation’s substance comes from the sounds that come from those objects, which emit the singing voices of people from across cultures, transformed and combined by Tutschku.
Tutschku, a music professor and director of the Harvard University Studio for Electroacoustic Composition, composed the piece in honor of the 50th anniversary of the building. Harvard constructed the Carpenter Center in 1963 for the visual and environmental studies department.
Tutschku envisioned the piece as an homage to Charles-Édouard Jeanneret, the architect of the Carpenter Center.
“Electric ringing sounds will be composed and emitted once, twice, three times a day, at fixed times,  emission of a formidable nature of softness and of power,” wrote Jeanneret, who is better known as Le Corbusier, in a note in 1960.
Inspired by these words, Hans Tutschku sought to transform the roof into “a place of imagined harmony.”
The installation will play three times a day and run through May of next year.

The Office of Faculty Development and Diversity is currently conducting its second University-wide faculty climate survey to examine attitudes toward work-life balance and the changing role of technology in the workplace.
“The survey is basically designed to help us get a sense of what the faculty are thinking about a whole host of issues relevant to faculty life,” said Judith D. Singer, senior vice provost for faculty development and diversity.
Topics covered by the survey include job satisfaction, departmental atmosphere, faculty mentorship programs, and the faculty tenure ladder.
“We very much want to use the survey to speak truth to power,” said Singer, who added that the survey can help faculty members “feel like their voices have been heard.”
Singer said that the survey addresses particular concerns about the impact of new technology in our “24/7” society.
“We’re plugged in all the time,” she said. “The distinction between home and work life is getting blurred.”
The survey is still open for faculty members to share their opinions, and Singer said that her office hopes for the highest response rate possible.
The University administered a similar survey in 2006 at the recommendation of University task forces chaired by University President Drew G. Faust, who was then the dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.
The 2006 survey boasted a 75 percent response rate and exposed concerns among faculty about access to affordable childcare. In response to that survey, the University created the Ladder Access Program, which grants scholarships to ladder faculty members so that they can enroll their families in childcare programs. The survey also led to the formation of the Harvard WATCH Portal, which connects faculty members with students who are paid to provide services such as babysitting, tutoring, and dog-walking.
“We’re trying to build a broader Harvard community,” Singer said.
Computer Science professor David C. Parkes, who filled out this year’s survey, said that he appreciated its emphasis on work and family life balance.
“This is definitely a concern among faculty,” Parkes said.
Although the survey is administered by the institutional research division of MIT’s Office of the Provost in part to ensure confidentiality, the results will be analyzed at Harvard.

As the Digital Public Library of America approaches its April 2013 launch, copyright laws still hinder the library’s ability to make a wide array of written materials accessible to the public.
Two years into its initial efforts—the DPLA was first envisioned in October 2010, soon after Harvard withdrew its collections from the Google Books digitization project due to legal concerns—primary founding member and Harvard University librarian Robert C. Darnton ’60 boasts that the DPLA has the potential to become the “mother of all libraries.”
But as the project moves forward, the problem of digitizing copyrighted material, essential for public collections, remains unsolved.
A series of legal decisions may affect the future of the project, which is currently based at Harvard’s Berkman Center for Internet & Society and has filed to be a stand-alone corporation and nonprofit organization.
The “magic date” is 1923, said David O’Brien, senior project coordinator at the Berkman Center—anything published before that year is fair game to be made public.
For other copyrighted works, protection extends for 70 years after the death of the author. Consequently, when the DPLA—which can only include works in the public domain—launches in April, its collections will lack the bulk of literature written in the 20th century.
“There is certainly a desire that at some point the DPLA should have in-copyright works,” O’Brien said. “The question is how to accomplish that in a sustainable fashion.”
Darnton also referenced a recent court decision regarding the limitations on exclusive rights for copyright holders. The ruling addressed the provision of “fair use,” the concept that copyright can be circumvented in certain cases to facilitate the production and dissemination of works to the general public.
The DPLA is “exploring the possibility of adapting the fair use provision” to make digitized works available, Darnton said. “We are doing this for the public good.”
Another legislative question that concerns DPLA is the matter of orphan works, copyrighted materials for which the original owner cannot be found after diligent search. The U.S. Copyright Office is currently reviewing protection rights for these works, estimated to number in the millions, according to Darnton.
James A. Leach, chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, which is a funder of the DPLA, said he expects that Americans will become more open to digitizing works under copyright.
“I doubt that the laws will be overturned,” he said. “I think what’s going to happen over time is that there will be accommodations made to copyright laws.”
Darnton also said he feels optimistic about the impending legal battles over copyright laws. “People defend their copyright ferociously—and rightly so,” he said.
The Authors Guild and Association of American Publishers are the two primary opponents to open access, he added, with authors arguing for their right to continue collecting royalties from their published work.
Yet Darnton does not see a conflict between these authors’ interests and DPLA’s mission. As a potential solution, he proposes a “moving wall” of digitization that would only provide free online access to material that was published more than 10 or 15 years ago.
DPLA proponents agree that the revolutionary nature of digital platforms calls for new and innovative legal solutions.
“I think that one of the greatest challenges of the digital age is to figure out how to take advantage of what digital materials permit,” said Paul N. Courant, dean of libraries at the University of Michigan and a member of the DPLA steering committee.
“The pot of gold has a lot of gold at the end,” he said. “But it’s going to take a while to figure out how to get there.”

The majority of students enrolled in the Harvard Business School’s 2+2 Program choose to wait longer than two years before attending the Business School, according to statistics for the second class admitted to the program.
2+2 admits college seniors to the Business School’s MBA program provided they work for at least two years after graduation. From the first cohort of 2+2 students, who graduated from college in 2009, 66 out of 106 came to the Business School after two years.
That number dropped to 26 out of 115 students from the second cohort which began school this year, dropping matriculation from 62 percent to 23 percent.
Deirdre C. Leopold, managing director of MBA admissions and financial aid, said the admissions office has become more “overt about signaling that it’s fine to take another year” beyond the two required.
Leopold said she thought the increasingly global economy might also affect the time students are willing to spend in the workforce.
“The first 2+2 cohort was launched into a very grim job market when they graduated from college,” Leopold said. “A lot of people in the [second] 2014 cohort were just having a wonderful time at work, and they saw that the average age of HBS is 26 to 27, and they wanted to stay in the world of work.”
Leopold said she welcomes the flexibility that the possibility of extra years on the job adds to the 2+2 Program.
She has said in the past that she thinks the program could be called X+2, to indicate the wide range of options available to accepted students after college graduation.
“We don’t want these really special, wonderful college seniors to feel in any way that by being in 2+2 they lose optionality,” Leopold said.
“We enable them to have that third year, but trust that they can make the best decision.”
According to statistics prepared by Assistant Director of MBA Admissions Dana Scalisi, admitted 2+2 students spend two to five years in the workforce before coming to the Business School.
From the first cohort of 2+2 admits who graduated from college in 2009, 66 matriculated with the class of 2013, 18 matriculated with the class of 2014, 13 will matriculate with the class of 2015, two will matriculate with the class of 2016, and seven students canceled, opting not to participate at all.
From the second cohort who graduated from college in 2010, 26 matriculated with the class of 2014, 41 will matriculate with the class of 2015, 36 will matriculate with the class of 2016, three will matriculate with the class of 2017, five students canceled, and four students are still deciding whether to matriculate with the class of 2015 or 2016.
Leopold said none of the cancellations were from students who chose to attend other business schools, but instead represent those who have “gone to other non-MBA programs or stayed in the workforce.”
Since announcing the 2+2 Program in 2007, the admissions office has filled four cohorts of 2+2 students and is currently selecting the fifth.
The Business School accepted 25 applicants in September and will send out additional decisions in the coming months, according to the Business School’s admissions website.

University leaders will sit down with student advocates of fossil fuel divestment and explore the possibility of creating a social choice fund, senior University officials told The Crimson this week.
“The Corporation has an obligation to listen to students, to faculty, to other members of the community because it educates our decisions, but in a community like Harvard you’re never going to have unanimity on anything,” said William F. Lee ’72, a member of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body.
Next semester, members of the Corporation’s Committee on Shareholder Responsibility will meet with students who have advocated over the course of the fall for the University to divest its more than $30 billion endowment from fossil fuels.
When the issue was offered as a referendum during Undergraduate Council elections last month, 72 percent of undergraduates who voted supported divestment.
Alli J. Welton ’15, a board member of Divest Harvard, Harvard’s chapter of Students for a Just and Stable Future, said she was optimistic about what could emerge from the meeting.
“We’ve been working really, really hard this semester, trying to open up a dialogue with the administration,” said Welton. “We think our case is reasonable enough that we can present it to them and there might be some next steps taken.”
Although the University will meet with student representatives, University President Drew G. Faust said it was “unlikely” that Harvard would change its investment strategy as a result of the conversation.
“My argument would be that our most effective impact on climate change is not going to come through any kind of divestment activity,” Faust said. “It’s going to come through what we do with our teaching, our research, the people...we support, the students who may be the heads of the EPA or all kinds of organizations.”
In addition, Corporation members said the University is entertaining the creation of a social choice fund—a fund to which alumni could donate that would be invested with an eye towards Socially Responsible Investment. SRI encourages the incorporation of environmental, social, and governance concerns into the evaluation of investments.
“The desire to see a social choice fund at Harvard is a topic that began coming up with increasing frequency in my conversations with students and alumni last spring, and it led me to suggest to the Corporation that we explore the possibility of creating such a fund,” said Faust in a statement. “We are in the process of examining how such funds are managed at other institutions to learn more about best practices and to determine whether a similar approach makes sense for Harvard.”
Jen Q. Y. Zhu ’14, the newly elected UC vice president, said she believes students should play a role in discussions with administrators.
“Especially at Harvard, on Harvard’s campus, there are a lot of students who really want to make a difference,” said Zhu, who is also an inactive Crimson photo editor. “If it’s engaging in huge issues like divestment, I think there’s absolutely no reason why students should not be engaging in these issues.”

As Harvard plans for development in Allston, some say that climate change and Hurricane Sandy-like storms could one day flood the neighborhood.
Letters to the Boston Redevelopment Authority about Harvard’s Institutional Master Plan Notification Form (IMPNF)—a rough draft of the University’s plans for Allston—ask Harvard to look for ways to protect the area against floods and rising sea levels.
Both the Charles River Watershed Association and two alumni—brothers Arthur L. Boright ’61 and Charles “Al” Boright ’68—took advantage of the 30-day public comment period required by Boston zoning laws to criticize the University’s IMPNF, which was released on Oct. 18.
The BRA will consider several letters before it releases its scoping determination, a public document that will ask Harvard to clarify its plans.
The Watershed Association, an organization whose mission is to use science and law to protect the Charles River Basin, emphasized in its letter that Harvard’s planning needed to include an open space between Allston’s residential areas and the river and to take into account stormwater management so that the area maintains its ability to sustain flood waters.
“[Harvard should] make sure we not only are making the right moves for infrastructure redevelopment, but also making the neighborhood more resilient to climate change and other infrastructure issues that arise in the future,” said Pallavi K. Mande, director of the association’s Blue Cities program, which helps plan environmentally friendly retrofitting projects.
The Borights’ letter argues that Harvard should suspend its project to develop a campus in Allston until Cambridge creates a comprehensive plan to combat rising water levels and to provide an outlet for storm surges from the Charles River Basin. Arthur worked as a weather officer for the Air Force and an atmospheric and space physicist for Boeing for most of his career. His brother worked as a lawyer on environmental and energy issues for Vermont’s legislative council.
Harvard ignored the troubling implications of global warming when formulating its project, Arthur Boright said in an interview. He described Harvard’s current proposal for development in Allston as “rosy-cheeked.”
Boright said that as polar ice caps in Antarctica and Greenland continue to melt, sea levels will keep rising. Coupled with increasingly frequent storms, water could wreak damage on the outdated infrastructure that currently protects the Charles River Basin from flooding.
“The Charles River Dam...no long provides long-term credible protection for the Charles estuary where Harvard and others have substantial investment and where Harvard now proposes further development,” Arthur Boright said.
A storm with approximately the same magnitude as Hurricane Sandy would send surges that could pour over the top of the current dam and send water through residential neighborhoods around Harvard’s campus, Boright said. A study quoted in the Borights’ letter said that sea water would flood most of Kendall Square, the MIT campus, and southern parts of Harvard Square.
Boright said that Harvard should plan as if its buildings would stand for hundreds of years, using his freshman dorm Hollis Hall—which has survived lightning bolts, fires, and 67 pounds’ worth of Revolutionary militia damage—as an example.
Harvard originally filed plans for Allston development in 2007, proposing, among other projects, a $1 billion science complex and renovation of Barry’s Corner. Those plans were put on hold in 2009 because of financial pressures, angering Allston residents. Last year, the University announced that it would resume development planning for the area.

The Harvard Innovation Lab hosted a kick-off event yesterday to celebrate the inaugural Deans’ Cultural Entrepreneurship Challenge featuring speakers including Yo-Yo Ma ’76 and Harvard Innovation Lab Director Gordon S. Jones.
The Challenge—through which students will have an opportunity to propose solutions for supporting and expanding the role of arts in society—emphasizes interdisciplinary innovation, a theme throughout yesterday’s event as well.
“A challenge is two different fields meeting,” said Ma in his remarks.
“We will find new thinking and new discoveries that will help solve some of the many problems facing our world today.”
Throughout the event, speakers emphasized the importance of collaboration across the University to the Challenge’s mission. “I take this as an example of what a university can do and can create—an extremely productive conversation between the reformative know-how of the Business School and the passionate creative expression world of art and art making,” said Diana Sorensen, dean of arts and humanities.
Ma and his music group, the Silk Road Ensemble, treated attendees to multiple pieces chosen to reflect this interdisciplinary vision.
Before playing his closing pieces, Ma addressed the nature of innovation.
“I would like to take a term from
ecology called [ecotone], when two different systems meet. What happens at that edge?” asked Ma.
“You have much more diversity of new life. And that’s what we’re talking about within the arts and humanities, arts and sciences.”
Jones’ speech helped articulate the Challenge’s direction. “We are looking for innovative proposals and solutions for arts and artists to survive and thrive,” he said.
“The I-Lab is a forum where resources can come together so that students can take their ideas as far as they can go. We want to set the opportunity up and let passion and educational motivations flourish.”
The Challenge will combine the expertise of Harvard Business School, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Arts and Humanities Division, and the Silk Road Project—the nonprofit arts organization led by Ma. In its first stage, which will run from December to February of the coming year, students will submit their initial proposals.
Finalists will be assigned mentors in May 2013 and given $5,000 to further develop their proposals before final submission. Administrators involved in the Challenge, which is open to students across the University, said they expected it to draw applications from hundreds of talented students.
Leaders from the Challenge especially encouraged undergraduates to partake in the program.
“The hope is that it would be a lot of undergraduates thinking about these things because in some ways they have a unique perspective that they can bring,” said Mukti V. Khaire, one of the events’ speakers and an associate professor at the Business School.

Six months after its formation, the Harvard Square Homeless Coalition gathered in the basement of the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter Wednesday morning to reflect on its first major successes: last month city councilors approved an initiative to keep the temporary restroom facility on Cambridge Common open and agreed to consider building a permanent facility there.
The coalition was formed this summer at a meeting of the Harvard Square Business Association, after business owners expressed concern about homeless individuals using their properties’ private restroom facilities.
The only other public toilet available at the time was in Christ Church on Garden Street, but after a number of drug overdoses in the facility, church administrators decided at the end of July they could no longer keep it open to the public for security reasons.
That’s when the coalition—made up of homeless advocacy groups and church communities, including the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, Christ Church, the First Church Shelter, and homeless support organizations Youth on Fire and Bread & Jams—stepped in.
They began by organizing a letter writing campaign that encouraged parents, athletic teams, students, tourists, homeless advocates, and others who would benefit from such a facility to write letters to the City Council and the Department of Public Works.
Today, six months and many letters later, the coalition has seen the fruits of its labors.
“We met for the first time in August and by October we had a port-o-john,” said Ayala Livny, the program manager for Youth on Fire, a shelter and HIV-prevention center for homeless youth. “I think that’s pretty amazing.”
Charles A. Hobbs ’13, an administrative director at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, said he has heard positive feedback on the temporary facility. Hobbs noted that given the city’s strict laws about public urination—which falls under the category of indecent exposure, a sexual offense—the lack of public facilities put the homeless population in an impossible position.
“It’s almost forcing someone to commit a crime,” Hobbs said.
With this achievement accomplished, the committee will now focus on ensuring that plans for a permanent restroom facility on Cambridge Common do not get lost in the bureaucratic shuffle at City Hall.
Rev. Jonathan T. Eden, assistant rector at Christ Church, emphasized the importance of continued contact between coalition members and city officials to ensure that the Council continues to move forward on the project, especially considering the upcoming renovations planned for Cambridge Common.
“It would be a shame to let that go by without some serious consideration of a bathroom being part of that plan,” he said.
While the coalition is still carefully planning its next project, its members also took time to reflect on their recent success. Livny noted that she was proud of the community organizing the coalition accomplished as well as the swift and positive response of the City Council.
“I feel slightly pathetic that I’m so proud of that port-a-potty over there,” Livny said. “But it’s a small thing that makes such a huge difference in people’s lives.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the distribution of inflammatory flyers across campus sparked community outrage and a swift administrative response, students and two House Masters criticized College administrators for diverting the conversation away from what they say are the most salient issues surrounding the controversy.
In the wee hours of the morning last Friday, students in all nine River Houses received flyers promoting a new fake final club that included provocative phrases such as “no fucking Jews,” “Jews need not apply,” and “Coloreds OK.”
Within hours, College administrators called in at least one student group leader in an effort to determine who was responsible for the flyers. They also recruited staff in the Houses to help investigate, according to an op-ed in Time written by Pforzheimer House Masters Nicholas A. Christakis and Erika L. Christakis ’86.
And by afternoon, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds denounced the flyers in an emailed statement to The Crimson that drew ire from some for placing undue focus on free speech, rather than final clubs.
“As an institution of higher learning, we are committed to engendering and safeguarding the free expression of ideas, including those that we might find offensive,” Hammonds wrote in a segment of her statement. “This commitment should not be mistaken, however, for the tacit approval of all speech that occurs on our campus.”
Hammonds’ critics say they wish her statement had been more concerned about issues surrounding final clubs, which they say promote a dangerous and exclusive social space on campus.
In their op-ed in Time, the Pforzheimer House Masters decried the “hyper-vigilance about campus speech” that they feel has detracted from larger issues surrounding final clubs.
“In the recent Harvard case, it also literally blinds authorities to more pressing problems for our students, such as the sexist and dangerous behaviors that still go unchecked behind closed doors,” they wrote.
Students echoed these sentiments, saying the real issue at hand is social space, not free speech.
“The easy way out of this situation is to talk about language that most people already know is offensive,” Carolyn W. Chou ’13 said. “The broader, harder conversation is about the social culture at Harvard.”
Chou, who went door-to-door in September 2011 to distribute letters discouraging sophomore men from participating in the final club punch process, said that the administration was sidestepping the need to be critical of final clubs.
William H. Ryan ’14 added that the reaction seemed “absurd” given the “obviously satirical” nature of the flyers.
“It’s a little overblown for all of this,” Ryan said of Hammonds’ statement. “The College would spend its time better dealing with other problems surrounding final clubs and with creating legitimate social spaces.”
The presidents of Harvard’s eight all-male final clubs did not respond to or declined requests for comment.
But an official of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a student rights advocacy organization which has criticized Harvard’s free speech policies in the past, said he had no problem with Hammonds’ statement.
“Harvard is free to have an institutional opinion on expression on its campus,” FIRE senior vice president Robert Shibley said.
However, Shibley disagreed with Hammonds’ assertion that the satirical flyers had gone too far, saying that part of satire’s effectiveness in sparking debate comes from its biting quality.
“Satire still has value in a free marketplace of ideas, and regardless of what message [the makers of the flyers] were trying to communicate, we should protect their right to free speech,” he said.

Coming off a resounding, 22-point defeat at the hands of Oklahoma City last Wednesday in which Houston guards Jeremy Lin ’10 and James Harden went a combined 6-of-23 from the field, the Rockets bounced right back this week to rack up two wins.
And playing against the Jazz Saturday night, Lin posted one of his best performances of the year.
In a high-scoring affair, the Harvard grad went 8-of-14 from the field to contribute 19 points—just two short of his season high—in the 124-116 Houston win.
Lin was productive all night, effectively distributing the ball to his teammates to amass eight assists while accumulating just two turnovers.
With Lin at the point spreading the ball around, seven of nine Rockets players that saw action reached double digits in scoring, and the team’s top four scorers were all within two points of each other.
"There's a lot more balance, and I think the ball is moving," Lin told the New York Times after the game. "It's starting to look more and more dangerous."
Last year, with the entire nation tuned in, Lin scored a sparkling 38 points to outduel Kobe Bryant in a big win for the New York Knicks.
Lin’s next matchup against the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday went slightly different. Bryant eclipsed Lin’s previous performance, netting 39 points, while Lin contributed relatively little and only scored four.
But despite Lin being a relative nonfactor and Bryant’s big day, Houston was able to snag a close win, 107-105, and rose to a 9-8 record that bumped the team above .500 for the first time since the beginning of the season.
The game went down to the wire, and two missed shots by Bryant and Metta World Peace in the closing seconds helped seal the win for the Rockets.
Lin played only 20 minutes in the contest, less than each of Houston’s other starters and three players who came off the bench. The point guard also coughed the ball up twice and tallied only three assists.
Harden also struggled to find the bottom of the net, going a rough 3-of-19 from the field. But the Rockets’ bench picked up the slack, with three reserves either exceeding or equaling Harden’s 15 points.
Houston, which has won five of its last six games, will look to continue its hot streak, and Lin will attempt to bounce back on Friday in a tough matchup with the San Antonio Spurs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is said that sports bring people together like nothing else. Families spend countless hours travelling to games and cheering each other on. Perhaps for no Harvard family is this truer than the Gemmells—senior Laura and freshman Michelle—both of whom play key roles on the Crimson women’s squash squad this year. Together with their oldest sister Jennifer, they have travelled the world to play squash at its highest junior levels and continued to compete in college.
All three of the Gemmell sisters play or have played Ivy League squash. Jen captained the Cornell women’s squash team in 2010-11 and is currently enrolled in law school. Laura and Michelle are dynamic members of the current Crimson squad.
The sisters’ squash days long predate their time in college, as they have been dominating junior squash in Canada since they were just teenagers.
“Our mom, when we were young, put us in a bunch of different sports,” Laura said. “We did gymnastics, swimming, tennis…a bunch of different things.”
Laura and Jen took a particular liking to squash, and Michelle followed suit.
“We’d go to tournaments and bring Michelle, and she’d be like, ‘Hey, I want to play too,’” Laura said.
Perhaps not coincidentally, Michelle started her squash career at the young age of seven.
Immediately, she was competing against girls much older than her.
And quickly, Michelle grew old enough to start training with her older sisters.
Although they are officially teammates for the first time at Harvard, Laura and Michelle have long been training together.
“I’d always hit with Laura and Jen before matches,” Michelle said.
Laura is one of, if not the most, accomplished junior squash players in Canadian history, having won 23 national titles.
“In Canada, Laura was the first woman to win the U19 category—which is the highest of the junior levels—four times,” Michelle said. “That means she was the best junior in Canada since she was 15. A couple of people have done it three times, but she was the first to do four.”
Jen and Michelle were no slacks themselves on the North American Junior circuit.
Jen was a member of Canadian Junior National Team in 2006 and 2007. She was ranked as high as No. 4 of all Canadian female juniors. Michelle won a total of 23 national championships as a kid and was a five-time Canadian champion at various age groups.
The junior circuit and world championships allowed the Gemmells to travel around North America and abroad to compete.
Each year, there are four major tournaments—the Canadian Open, US Open, Scottish Open, and British Open—at which they would compete in consecutive weeks.
“[Those four weeks] would be the most fun times of the circuit,” Michelle said. “At each [tournament], you would be around the same people. It was a close group at the very top who would travel internationally. One of the great experiences I got out of it was meeting people from different countries.”
But even though both of the younger Gemmell sisters represented Canada at the Junior World Squash Championships, they never represented their country at the same time.
“The year we were supposed to be together, I just missed the cut,” Michelle said.
In 2011, when Michelle represented Canada in the Junior World Championships, the event was to be held in Egypt but was relocated to Cambridge, Mass. because of political unrest.
“[The tournament in Cambridge] is kind of why I ended up wanting to come to [Harvard],” Michelle said. “I loved it. It was awesome.”
So far, the two younger Gemmell sisters have helped Harvard to the start of what looks to be another dominant season, although the No. 1 Crimson has yet to face its toughest tests. Laura has led the Crimson from the No. 1 spot in two of its first three matches.
Three years ago, Laura, a freshman at the time, won an individual College Squash Association championship, while also helping the Crimson to a team national title the same year. Michelle, a loyal supporter, was there to watch.
Currently women’s squash is not an Olympic sport. There was an international push to add it to the Rio de Janeiro games of 2016, but the attempt proved fruitless.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rowing excellence is not uncommon at Harvard. And this fall, a new crop of oarswomen has swept its way to an undefeated fall season.
The Radcliffe heavyweight crew novices won all three of their races—the Head of the Housatonic, the Green Monster and the Foot of the Charles—outstripping opposing crews by at least 14 seconds in each victory.
“If [our team has] been able to be successful early on, then that sort of sets the standard and sets the bar pretty high,” said Black and White coach Liz O’Leary about the strong fall season.
With the overwhelming success that the newest Radcliffe rowers have seen all season, one might think that the crew is composed entirely of USRowing Junior National Champions with years of experience on the water.
In fact, quite the opposite is true. While there are some on the squad that do have a classic recruited-rower profile, members of the class come from a variety of backgrounds, something O’Leary cites as positive.
“It’s somewhat unusual to have your recruited class have some with a lot of experience and some with not as much, but we’re very confident in our ability to teach people how to row,” O’Leary said.
DIFFERENT STROKES FOR DIFFERENT FOLKS
Laura Bleeke and Erin Slatery, who both began rowing early in high school, followed a more predictable trajectory toward collegiate crew than many of their classmates.
Bleeke, who hails from St. Louis, initially played volleyball because of her six-foot stature but decided to switch to rowing after meeting coaches from the local club.
“I went out to the boathouse and tried [rowing] out sophomore year [of high school],” Bleeke said. “I really liked it and it was a lot of fun.... I’ve been rowing since then.”
Bleeke rowed for the St. Louis Rowing Club for three years before following in her sister Caroline’s footsteps and coming to Harvard.
“The team here is great, [and] the dynamic is awesome,” Bleeke explained. “It’s really competitive and all the girls are really talented so they push you.... You know that they’re trying their hardest, which is really important when you’re rowing.”
Slatery also points to the strong group ethos as one of the most positive aspects of her experience so far with Radcliffe crew.
“[The team is] just so tight off the water and on the water,” Slatery said. “We’re not cliquey, there’s not a lot of drama.... The upperclassmen have been so supportive. They’re our friends; they’re constantly coming up to tell us that we’re fantastic.”
Slatery, a native of the DC area, was a highly-touted recruit and earned many honors from USRowing. She began rowing freshman year of high school but became seriously committed to the sport as a junior when she realized how far she could go with more training.
This fall season, Slatery has often appeared in the bow or stroke seats of the eight, a spot reserved for rowers with strong technical skills.
“[Rowing with Radcliffe is] a completely different level of rowing than I’m used to,” Slatery said. “I think it’s one of the most exciting parts of the sport—just to be able to row with some athletes who have been in boats for eight years.”
Spring will be a return to a familiar season of racing for Slatery, who had never previously participated in a fall season. After a break from the water over the winter, the team will compete with each other for seats in the various Ivy races that will occur over the semester.
“There’ll be a lot of competition within the team, where we’re all trying to beat each other to make the best boats,” she said. “Then in the spring, we’ll come together again as a team and we’ll go out there and beat Yale and all the other Ivies.”
A SWEEPING IMPORT
It’s over 9000 miles from Freddie Archibald’s hometown of Christchurch, New Zealand to Harvard, but the distance certainly hasn’t slowed down the freshman, who was able to row with the first varsity eight during the fall season.
“It was heaps of fun,” Archibald said. “The older girls, all the seniors and everyone, were so nice and it was such a privilege to row with them. Just technically and physically, they’re all pretty amazing.”
Archibald began rowing as a freshman in high school at St. Margaret’s College and found great success with the sport. She rowed for the New Zealand Junior National Team, competing at the Junior World Rowing Championships at Eton in the summer of 2011 in a coxless four. Archibald met the recruiters from Harvard at Eton and later agreed to join the Class of 2016.
“Freddie—now there’s a personality,” O’Leary said. “Freddie Archibald is a character.... She’s been quite successful in everything she’s done here this fall to the point where I have her in my top boat as a freshman.”
Archibald admits that the transition from living in New Zealand to Cambridge has certainly not been without its challenges.
“[Coming from New Zealand] it’s really different,” Archibald said. “I can’t place my finger on it. I thought, ‘English-speaking [country]; English-speaking [country]; it’s be the same,’ but it’s really not. I’m still adjusting. It’s just a whole different culture here, a different sense of humor, different way we talk—just everything.”
Regardless of any troubles acclimating to life in a new country, Archibald has had a commanding fall season. Sitting in the four-seat for the Championship Eight race at Head of the Charles alongside with some of the world’s best, she helped Radcliffe crew glide to a seventh-place finish in a field of 40.
Still, Archibald looks forward to joining the freshmen again for winter training and the spring season.
“I’ve really missed rowing with the other freshmen,” she said. “They’re a great group of girls and we’ve all bonded really well.”
BECKONED TO THE BOATHOUSE
There may be a lot of hype, especially after The Game, that a certain school in New Haven falls short of fair Harvard, but for freshman Sophia Becker, it wasn’t the strength of the football team that swayed her decision to come to Cambridge.
“I was going to play soccer at Yale, but [assistant coach] Cory [Bosworth] and Liz saved me,” Becker quipped. “[Now], here I am, rowing at Harvard, and there really is no other place I’d rather be.”
Although Becker had just a year of crew under her belt at the Essex Rowing Club, unlike the other recruits who had rowed all through high school, she attributes her success on the water to soccer, a sport she had played her entire life.
“Soccer is definitely a big emphasis on legs, and so is rowing,” Becker said. “I think that the strength [necessary for crew] is definitely something that I’ve had my whole life, so that’s been really helpful. [Soccer is] also a focused sport, like rowing is…so I’ve taken what I’ve known from soccer and applied it to rowing and it’s made me better.”
Despite her lack of crew experience, Becker’s erg times sparked the attention of the heavyweight coaches, who recruited her to Harvard. Ever since, the freshman has flourished on the team.
Although O’Leary notes that it is optimal to recruit women with crew experience, she appreciates the advantages that rowers like Becker with previous athletic ability bring to the team.
“If you get a great athlete, [then] they understand competition, they understand training, they understand hard work, they understand consistency, [and] they understand success and failure and how you come back from that,” O’Leary said. “If they already have those basic ingredients, I can teach them how to row.”
FROM THE COURT TO THE RIVER
Coming into Harvard, sophomore Kelly Whelan probably had a very different idea of the direction her Crimson athletic career would take.
“I started training competitively for tennis when I was six,” Whelan said. “My older sister played D1 tennis [and] my mom played D1 tennis, so it’s kind of a family sport.”
Whelan was recruited by Harvard to play tennis and did just that her freshman year, but after over a decade on the court, she decided to take her talents to the water.
“At the end of [freshman] year, I decided I needed a change, and so I took the summer to make my decision,” Whelan said. “I had been talking to Liz a little bit, and it just seemed like a really good opportunity, so I just walked on [to the team].”
Whelan may not have joined the team until her sophomore year, but she says her unique start with the sport actually gave her an advantage on the water.
“I think a big part of the freshman year athletic experience is really learning how to be an athlete at Harvard,” Whelan said. “I’m not as convinced that it’s really that sport-specific.”
Out of the roughly 40 walk-ons that Radcliffe crew receives every year, O’Leary estimates that between five and 15 ultimately stay with the sport. Although the walk-ons are not part of her original crew class, the coach cherishes the opportunity to spread the sport of crew to potential rowers who may never have been exposed to the sport before.
“I love walk-ons because they’re sort of the bonus to your recruiting class. We have these great kids whom we’ve recruited, and we’re really excited about them, and we think this is going to be the core of this freshman/novice class,” O’Leary said. “[But for those] who stay with the sport, it’s just really fun to see how they, over time in their freshman year, just add more and more to the personality and the energy and the success of the novice team, and they can have a big impact pretty fast.”
While the Black and White has been characterized by success in the past, taking the Ivy championship last year and placing multiple athletes on Olympic teams, O’Leary recognizes the edge that this unbeaten novice class provides for Radcliffe crew.
“When you have a strong and successful freshmen class, that sort of pushes everybody,” O’Leary said. “Yes, you like to have the top, most experienced returning athletes from the varsity eight who won the varsity eight last year to be pulling people up. But to have the younger class pushing everybody up is just going to bring up the expectation and opportunity for the whole team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the second time this year, the Harvard men’s basketball team (4-3) will leave the state of Massachusetts, as it heads to Storrs, Conn. to take on the University of Connecticut (6-2).
When the teams met last year at Gampel Pavilion, the then No. 25 Crimson trailed by just two points at the break but missed 11 of its first 12 shots from the floor in the second half and quickly went down by 16, eventually dropping the contest, 67-53.
The scene is different this year. Harvard is missing graduates Keith Wright ’12 and Oliver McNally ’12 and is spending the season without Brandyn Curry and Kyle Casey.
UConn, two years removed from a national championship in 2011, has lost three players to the NBA in the last two years. Senior Alex Oriaki transferred to Missouri after the NCAA lowered sanctions on the Huskies that prevent them from competing in postseason play this year.
Former UConn coach Jim Calhoun, who spent 26 straight seasons patrolling the sidelines in Storrs, Conn.—winning 618 games and three national championships with the Huskies—was replaced by former assistant coach Kevin Ollie in the offseason after an abrupt retirement this September.
Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said that while much of the opposing team is in flux—UConn only returns two starters this year—the Huskies present a stiff challenge.
“At the end of the day, it’s still Connecticut,” Amaker said. “It has played some good games this year and it’s been nationally ranked. Kevin has done an outstanding job in the situation that he is in and being able to keep together that program.”
The Crimson took down crosstown rival Boston College for the fifth straight year on Tuesday, putting up 48 points in the second half en route to a 79-63 victory over the Eagles.
Freshman point guard Siyani Chambers scored 21 points and added seven assists for the team, playing 37 minutes and leading a second-half scoring outburst by the Crimson that turned a two-point halftime lead into a 10-point advantage just four minutes into the second half. Sophomore forward Wesley Sanders added 18 points on eight-of-13 shooting with five assists and two steals.
This is the second of Harvard’s three games against schools from the big six BCS conferences. But unlike against Boston College, the Crimson is winless in three attempts against the Huskies with Amaker at the helm, and UConn leads the overall series, 15-2.
Junior co-captain Laurent Rivard, who added nine points and shot two-of-four from behind the arc against the Eagles, said that key matchups in the game will be those against the UConn guards, junior Shabazz Napier and sophomore Ryan Boatright. The two Huskies shoot an identical 84 percent from the free throw line and average a total of nearly 33 points, seven assists, and three steals.
“[Like BC,] UConn will also be a battle,” Rivard said. “They had a good win over at Michigan State, and it’s always a battle in those environments, with big arenas and loud fans.”
“Siyani will definitely have to take one of their guards,” he continued. “For him it will be a good matchup. We will have to stay in front of them and not let them get past us by having good help-side defense.”
Harvard will face an impressive point guard in Boatright, who shares a similar stature with Chambers—both are an even 6’0,” though Chambers is 10 pounds heavier. Both playmakers have had their best games of the season in recent weeks. Boatright scored in double digits five times in the last six games and Chambers had his best two performances of the year in his last three games.
After putting up only two points and three assists in an 18-point loss to St. Joseph’s, Chambers put up 16 points and eight assists against Vermont and then set a career high in points against Boston College.
“I’m very pleased with Siyani,” Amaker said. “He’s done a great job of orchestrating our transition game and running our sets. He’s a presence already on the team as a point guard, and we need him on the floor as our best ball-handler. He’s a kid that has the ability and the opportunity to be the leader, and I’m not surprised by what he’s been able to do and what has transpired over the past weeks.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED 12/13/12
The awards keep coming in for the Harvard football team, which has placed four players on All-America teams thus far this offseason.
Senior tight end Kyle Juszczyk leads the way with five total honors, including being named to the Associated Press All-America First Team.
Juszczyk also earned a spot on the Beyond Sports Network, American Football Coaches Association, and CollegeSportsMadness.com first-team All-American squads and on Monday was named to The Sports Network second team.
Joining Juszczyk on the Beyond Sports Network squad are senior quarterback Colton Chapple and junior tight end Cameron Brate, both of whom were named to the Beyond Sports Network second team.
Sophomore Zach Hodges also earned All-American honors, as he was named to the CollegeSportsMadness.com second team.
2012 marks Juszczyk’s first time earning first-team All-American honors after being named to the Beyond Sports Network and The Sports Network second teams a season ago.
The senior tied for the Ivy League lead with eight touchdowns while tallying 706 receiving yards, good for fifth in the conference. Juszczyk ended his career as the Crimson’s all-time leader in yards, catches, and touchdowns from the tight end position.
Chapple was named a first-team All-American for the first time after ending second in the nation in passing efficiency and finishing the year with 24 touchdown passes and 3,169 yards of total offense, both single-season program records. Last week, the quarterback was named the Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year, and he earlier won the FCS Gold Helmet as the New England Player of the Year award.
Brate formed a dynamic duo with Juszczyk at tight end this season with 592 yards and six touchdowns on 41 receptions. The junior was also named to the Capital One Academic All-America Division I football team by the College Sports Information Directors of America. He was the only Ancient Eight player to earn that honor.
Hodges, a defensive end, ranked seventh in the FCS in sacks (9.0) and tackles for loss (16.0) despite not starting a single game.
For 14 straight years, the Crimson has now had at least one All-American.

December 8, 1941: Japanese Students Give Impressions of Startling Action of Fatherland
The two Japanese citizens studying at Harvard who could be reached last night, differed greatly in their reactions to the news. One had expected a war, the other found it "a complete shock."
Mr. Nisiboro, a 23-year-old graduate student attached to the Japanese embassy in Washington, declared last night that "we were not expecting this war," and expressed belief that special envoy Kurusn was just as surprised as anyone in this country about the bombing of Pearl Harbor.
December 2, 1952: Faculty Considers Parietal Changes at Meeting Today
The last vestige of College puritanism--House regulations for women guests--comes up for review by the Faculty today.
The Faculty will consider and probably vote on the Administrative Board's proposal to change the rules. The changes: From 1-7 p.m. to 4-7 p.m. on weekdays; from 1-8 p.m. to 4-11 p.m. on Saturdays and nights before holidays.
December 4, 1952: Union Council Decides on Makeshift Billet for Freshman Study
While 500 freshman petitioners waited for news on their proposal to keep Lament Library open on Sundays, and later on week nights, the Union Committee voted last night to obtain a temporary study hall for '56 use.
The Union Library Committee suggested the use of either the basement of Memorial Church or the Union, stocking the study hall with reference material.
The student Council has announced its support to obtain the extension of Lamont hours.
December 7, 1985: Lampy Claims, Then Denies Blame For Princeton Wheel of Fortune Hoax
The Harvard Lampoon, the nation's oldest humor magazine, might have the world believe that it successfully humiliated hundreds of Princeton students by falsely telling them they would be on the popular game show Wheel of Fortune, and that they would meet celebrated hostess/cult figure Vanna White.
But the Daily Princetonian says the Lampoon had nothing to do with the hoax, which was a huge failure. Meanwhile, a University of Pennsylvania debating society has also claimed responsibility for the prank.
Now the Lampoon can't decide whether it actually pulled off the prank, whether it didn't play the trick but is accepting responsibility for it, or whether it actually had nothing to do with the whole incident at all.
