After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Slaves, a punk rock duo hailing from the United Kingdom, graced the Gov Ball NYC Stage early on Friday afternoon and performed with gusto to a small but devoted crowd. The duo was comprised of vocalist and guitarist Laurie Vincent as well as drummer and vocalist Isaac Holman, who graced the stage in plain clothes (Holman remained topless for the entire set). The duo took to the stage with a destructive energy as they roared into their microphones. As Holman pounded the drums, the percussion reverberated loudly overhead, and Holman sweated visibly as he earnestly hammered the drums. Most notable was when Holman screamed into the microphone, especially when he bellowed the band’s name at the end of their songs. Vincent interacted with the audience at great length, asking security guards to hug his fans, shouting out to crowd members, and speaking to certain fans to let them know to take videos instead of pictures. Decked from head to toe in tattoos, both Vincent and Holman vehemently nodded their heads in time with their grungy riffs as their music blasted through the speakers into an energized crowd, their performance setting a frenzied tone for the next few hours.
Bronx native rapper A$AP Twelvyy, a member of hip-hop collective A$AP Mob, performed on the enclosed American Eagle Stage. Lights intermittently flashed throughout the area, illuminating the entire crowd as A$AP Twelvyy danced around onstage. Most captivating was A$AP Twelvyy’s backdrop, which featured a collage of images which would appear briefly before being quickly replaced by others, such as pictures of butts, Donald Duck, and random video clips spliced together in strange and interesting patterns as A$AP Twelvyy performed. He also devoted time to matters other than his rapping, from denouncing the president and declaring, “Fuck Donald Trump.” to promoting his new album to the crowd. The acoustics for A$AP Twelvyy’s set were a little awkward, as the sound paradoxically grew clearer the farther away from the stage one went. The show’s climax came when A$AP Twelvyy performed A$AP Mob’s 2014 Billboard Top 10 hit “Hella Hoes,” as flashing purple lights enveloped the crowd. During this song, A$AP Twelvyy’s energy was most palpable as he rapped the song’s chorus above the noise of screaming fans. A$AP Twelvyy’s captivating performance energized his fans, and the rapper was clearly energized himself as he yelled to the crowd, “If you rock with me throw your As up!” Despite sound difficulties, A$AP Twelvyy’s enthusiasm and background displays ensured that the rapper was heard and noticed by festival-goers.
While many political remarks were made by Governor’s Ball performers throughout the day, Belly, a Palestinian-Jordanian-Canadian rapper had perhaps the most politically-charged performance of all. Impressively, Belly was able to make his political opinions known while performing with a calm, relaxed air as he lit a joint onstage in the middle of his performance, much to the glee of the crowd. Sporting a white sweatshirt bearing the word “IMMIGRANT” in red capital letters with his moniker, Belly, written on the back, all with red beanie to match, Belly dominated the stage with his unwavering passion. As the set went on, Belly continually threw out remarks about Donald Trump, Sarah Palin, and the Flint, Michigan Water crisis before asking the feverish crowd, “Where my immigrants at?,” subsequently launching into his 2017 song “Immigration to the Trap” off of his equally politically conscious album “Mumble Rap.” Belly bounced around the stage with a joyful energy, and his wide grin never wavered from his face. The highlight of his set came when he performed his song “Trap Phone,” as Belly was joined by the song’s featured artist, rapper Jadakiss, who took to the stage in a grape purple sweatsuit as the two performed the track together. Belly’s performance was perhaps the most unique of all in content, as he was able to have an extremely political set while remaining carefree and whimsical as he danced around, creating a tone quite difficult to replicate.
An observer need only look at Governor’s  Ball attendees’ apparel to discern that rapper Post Malone was one of the most anticipated performers of the day—there were numerous festival-goers sporting yellow cloths with the word “beerbongs” in homage to Post Malone’s platinum 2018 album “beerbongs & bentleys” with their hair braided in Post Malone’s signature style. Post Malone had a dramatic stage entrance, as he appeared amidst billows of smoke while chimes played somewhat ominously in the background. When he appeared, clad in a black Adidas shirt with his signature long hair tied into a bun, he began his set with the song “Too Young.” Interestingly enough, after crooning into the microphone about not wanting to die before becoming successful, Post Malone began speaking to the audience about the pressures of fame. The rapper clutched a red SOLO cup which he drank from often, smiling and seemingly content. Adorned in a pair of black sunglasses, Post Malone was deliberate in explaining to the audience, “I’m not wearing glasses cause I think I’m cool, I’m wearing glasses because it's sunny as a motherfucker.” At one point, in a touching moment, Post Malone stopped performing midsong and urged security to help a fan who he saw was in distress, asking the audience if they were all right before he continued. In a less touching moment, Post Malone dedicated a song to “the stupid bitch who broke [his] heart,” which was met by rapturous screams of the audience who chanted “fuck that bitch” in tune with Post Malone. Post Malone’s performance was a set of dichotomies—between swagger and hesitancy, apologeticness and disclaimers. Through these juxtapositions, Post Malone performed passionately, gleefully, and above all, vulnerably.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Headlining Governor’s Ball on June 1, the first night of the festival was 42-year-old singer, songwriter, and record producer Jack White. Though the demographic of the Governor’s Ball tends towards teenagers and young adults, White’s appearance drew in a number of older attendees, some of whom came to the festival just to see him (like the 41-year-old woman I spoke with who spoke highly and enthusiastically of White’s record label, Third Man Records).
The crowd for White’s performance began to form long before the musician took the stage, and giant, old-timey countdown clocks projected onto the stage’s side screens heightened the anticipation around 15 minutes before White appeared. As the countdown clocks struck zero, unlike other artists who left fans waiting with baited breath for their appearance, White immediately walked out, forcefully shaking the hair out of his face as he strode across the Gov Ball NYC Stage. Two giant screens flanked White as he performed, displaying neon blue tunnels of light endlessly, surrounded by lightning bolts, and the captivating image pulsed as he sang onstage.
As dramatic pillars of smoke descended into the crowd, casting shadows across the audience as they mingled with the moody blue lights beaming over the entire scene, White began his intro song, “Over and Over and Over,” off of his newest album, “Boarding House Reach.” White was smooth on the guitar as he handled difficult riffs while maintaining an even rhythm, and his calm playing was juxtaposed by the fierce intensity with which he sang into the microphone. The blue tint of the stage alluded to the similar tones used in the music video for “Over and Over and Over,” and White howled the lyrics with gusto. Blue was virtually the color of the set, with lights flashing and changing hue as they illuminated the crowd.
White’s prowess on the guitar was obvious as he seemingly never made a single error and played with an astounding ease. White performed some older tunes, one being the 2001 White Stripes song “Hotel Yorba.” At one point in the song, White relinquished his guitar, ran to the piano behind him onstage, and hastily joined the pianist in a fierce, up-tempo duo which sent the audience into peals of excitement. White seemed to build off of this energy, making high-pitched whooping sounds and caws into the microphone as he exuded vitality from every pore.
Despite his melodically and lyrically intense songs, White seemed strangely relaxed, perhaps even rigid: For the first few minutes of the set he stood directly in front of the microphone. However, during “Love Interruption,” something shifted as White belted the song’s lyrics with a new fervency. White rotated between several guitars throughout the night, and his ragged riffs coupled with the soulful aggression of his voice set a forceful, yet emotional tone.
Despite the heavy nature of his rock music, White was able to present his work often in a fun, almost light manner as he made sound effects into his microphone and played with a tangible passion and zest for the duration of his show. Though somewhat stiff at first, White did not take long to settle into the space and make the stage his own. White’s persistent zeal is truly memorable, and the ardency with which he performed each and every one of his songs while enveloped by soft blue lights was a powerful way to end the first night of the Governor’s Ball.

It is 7:00 a.m. on a Thursday morning in 2008, and while the rest of campus is just waking up, several Harvard students—along with two faculty members—are in a minivan on their way to the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Norfolk. They make this journey once a week: the one-hour drive is followed by a check-in process, after which they are finally able to meet up with the rest of their classmates and begin discussing the week’s readings.
The Prison Studies Project was founded at Harvard University in 2008 by professors Kaia Stern and Bruce Western. According to the project’s website, its goals are to “promote informed conversation about the challenges of mass incarceration” and to “awaken the broadest possible public to the ways we punish, and to reimagine justice in the United States.” The project launched with a class called “Race, Poverty, and Community Justice,” offered jointly to Harvard students—both from the College and graduate schools—and to incarcerated students enrolled in Boston University’s Metropolitan College. Classes associated with the project took place from 2008 to 2014 in both MCI-Norfolk, a men’s facility, and MCI-Framingham, a women’s facility.
“It was wildly different than any other class I’ve taken,” Catherine M. Sirois ’10 says.
***
Albert J. Maldonado, an alumnus of the Divinity School, vividly recalls a preliminary meeting for “Ethics, Punishment, and Race,” the 2013 iteration of the class taught by Stern. The class garnered far more interest than its structure could support; as part of the application process, Stern had each student introduce themself and explain their motivation for wanting to participate.
Five years later, Maldonado still remembers one student’s statement: “I’ll never forget what he said—he said, ‘I am a prosecutor in Los Angeles. I prosecute, convict people of crimes and send them to prison. And I do it all the time. And I have never stepped foot into a prison. I don’t know what it looks like. I don’t know what it smells like. I don’t know what the conditions are there. Nothing. And I feel that it is my moral obligation to learn more about where I am sending these people before I [continue to] send them there.’ And I thought, ‘Damn!’”
The prosecutor was Miguel T. Espinoza, who was enrolled at the Kennedy School student at the time.  “Prosecutors usually are precluded from speaking to defendants or suspects in cases,” he explains. “My classmates were willing, thankfully, to discuss with me the way that the system was impacting them.”
For the first time, Espinoza got to hear about the “simple things” in his classmates’ lives: “What they did when they got up, how they spent their hours during the day, the types of food that they ate, the access—or lack of access—to work and educational opportunities… I had never been able to have conversations like that.”
Among Espinoza’s and Maldonado’s classmates was Pony Holmstrom, who was then two semesters into college classes offered at MCI-Framingham by the Boston University Prison Education Program. She was one of six students handpicked by the program to participate in the class.
Holmstrom says she found the class extremely meaningful. “I think for the first time in my life, I’d been challenged academically,” she says. “And I found that I could rise to the challenge, which was a great thing to learn about myself.”
Professor Stern, or Kaia as she was known to the students, “worked really hard to ensure that we were all humanized to one another, that the Harvard students coming in could get a feel of who we were, that we weren’t just prisoners,” Holmstrom says.
Stern would start each class by going around in a circle and inviting each student to share a challenge or a success from the past week of their lives. “It was a really nice way to allow us all to get to know one another, warm things up, so that we could learn, you know?” Holmstrom says.
Espinoza agrees. “When we were in the classroom, we were classmates,” he says. “We could have truly open and candid conversations… everyone was on equal footing and was able to equally contribute.”
***
When the class ended, students’ paths diverged. Lauren E. Faraino ’13 reflects, “It’s amazing to me that on the one hand, one of us was going to leave the classroom and a few months later have a degree from Harvard, and the other person was going to continue to serve their sentence and hopefully be released in the next few years.”
After completing the class, Holmstrom continued to serve her sentence at MCI-Framingham. During the four and a half years she was incarcerated, she took other classes through the Boston University Prison Education Program and earned a 3.98 GPA. She also worked two jobs at the prison, one in construction and the other in maintenance; her duties included making electrical and plumbing repairs.
In 2014, Holmstrom was released. “The first two years were really great,” she says. “I was really fortunate in that I had a fair amount of trade skill—I’ve done a lot of trade work in my life—so I was able to get work really quickly and I was doing a lot of speaking work for Harvard”—including a few events with Stern—“and Lasell College and other area schools.”
But then, work started to dry up.  “For the last two years I’ve had a really hard time finding gainful, lasting employment, and that’s kind of thrown me into a bit of tailspin… Since my release from prison I’ve found that everything from housing to employment to education has been—there’ve been major roadblocks.” She is conscious that the problem is much bigger than just herself, observing that society’s attitude towards formerly incarcerated people has placed additional obstacles in her everyday life. “You know, this can be a life sentence,” Holmstrom said. “You had your punishment, but the punishment doesn’t stop.”
Many of Stern and Western’s former students at Harvard, meanwhile, cite the class’s influence not only on their perspectives, but also on their career choices.
Faraino, who took the class as an undergraduate, says the course influenced her decision to go to law school. She received her law degree in 2016 from the University of Chicago.  “I used what I learned in the course to apply to pro bono cases,” she says.
Faraino recently served as part of a legal team working on the case of Rodricus Crawford. Crawford, who is  African-American, was sentenced to death in a Louisiana court cited by Supreme Court Justice Stephen G. Breyer as imposing a disproportionate number of death sentences.  The prosecutor, Dale Cox, at one point publicly said he wanted  Crawford to undergo  “as much physical suffering as it is humanly possible to endure before he dies.” Cox earned  a national reputation when he said, "I think we [the state of Louisiana] need to kill more people.”
Faraino’s team was ultimately successful in overturning Crawford’s conviction.  He is now a free man.
Faraino says the Harvard course “allowed me to go into [Crawford’s] case with a much more empathetic view than simply writing out the legal arguments that I needed to go through.”
Maldonado now practices municipal law in California and estimates that state prosecution work comprises  roughly 10 percent of his job. Now, whenever he has prosecutorial discretion to decide whether to require someone to pay a fine or do community service as opposed to serving some time in jail, he says, “I always, always, always defer to the fine or the community service, because, you know, I have been into a prison… I don’t want to send them to a place like that.”
The classes stopped running in 2014 due to a lack of funding.
University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga wrote in an email, “Harvard students and faculty currently support a variety of prison education programs. These efforts are continuously evolving.”
This spring, for the first time, Harvard hosted a conference to discuss prison education; Stern was one of the featured speakers. PBHA also harbors a program called HOPE (Harvard Organization for Prison Education and Reform), which tutors in local correctional facilities and leads various on-campus advocacy efforts.
Faraino believes Harvard should support these unique, out-of-the-classroom experiences.   “It reminds students that the work that we’re doing in those four years—or however long that we’re studying at Harvard—is so much greater than the coursework itself.  I think it’s sometimes difficult to remember as a student that you’re studying so that you can go on and contribute something wonderful to the world.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard School of Public Health and the University's Office for Sustainability recently launched a partnership with Google aimed at investigating the use of toxic materials in construction.
The program will be in affiliated with the school’s newly created Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment, directed by former Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy. Researchers will analyze the health effects of chemicals used in building materials, and use that information to inform decisions at Harvard and other institutions.
“The collaboration aims to improve public health and the well-being of communities, reduce the use of harmful chemicals, and leverage lessons learned to create a model that can be replicated by other organizations,” a school press release stated.
Joseph Allen, an assistant professor at the school, said he believes the partnership will help improve the safety of chemicals used in construction.
He said “very few” of the 80,000 chemicals used in building have been tested for safety because the regulatory framework in place treats chemicals as “innocent until proven guilty.”
Over the last two years, Allen has worked with the Office of Sustainability to examine Harvard’s purchasing decisions and ensure they are in line with materials-safety research. Together with the office, Allen has worked on safety standards for Harvard’s carpet and furniture purchases, according to Heather Henriksen, managing director of the office.
Henriksen said the team’s attention turned to Google because of the similarities between the two institutions.
“We really started to see that there are a lot of synergies between our organizations,” she said, pointing to the similar square footage, governance structure, and interest in transparency between Harvard and Google.
She added that Harvard and Google have already collaborated informally, so this partnership is not their first work together.
McCarthy joins the project after directing the EPA under former President Barack Obama for four years. During her time at the EPA, McCarthy instituted the Clean Power Plan, which aimed to reduce domestic carbon emissions. She said the strength of Harvard’s public health programs drew her to the University.
“It’s pretty simple. The best is here. And this is where I want to be,” she said in a school podcast.
In addition to her role at the School of Public Health, McCarthy has been active at the Kennedy School, where she served as a fellow at the Institute of Politics last spring.
“The Center will pave the way for new research and student engagement on energy systems, food and nutrition, healthier buildings, and products to benefit our school, our country, and the world,” School of Public Health Dean Michelle Williams said at the launch event for the center Wednesday.
