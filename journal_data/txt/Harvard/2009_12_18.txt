After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yesterday, leaders from across the globe joined their negotiators at COP15, the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen. After a week of conflict, disagreement, and near gridlock, the “pessimistic tone” seemed to lift when U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton announced America’s support for a global pool of funds to help poor countries that will face negative impacts from global warming. This offer demonstrates a laudable attempt to move the negations forward, although details still remain unclear regarding America’s contribution to the pool. As the conference comes to a close within the next day, it is of the utmost importance that the U.S. ensures, as best it can, that countries sign an agreement in Copenhagen.
In her statement, Clinton advocated for a fund of at least $100 billion dollars per year by 2020, to aid countries in dealing with the climate-related disasters that could be on their way. While the EU did not seem overly impressed with the announcement—an indication of potential disappointment at the suggested sum—Clinton’s voice re-energized other players, leading negotiators in the right direction. India’s Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh “hailed” the announcement, calling it a “‘very important step.’” Considering India’s role as a leader among developing countries, this new outlook could prove significant.
However, despite this positive turn-around, the United States must propose stricter targets for reducing its own emissions if it hopes to reach an agreement, and furthermore, mitigate the harmful effects of climate change. Developing countries rightly expect nations like the U.S. to take responsibility for centuries of greenhouse-gas emissions, and President Barack H. Obama should take this message to heart upon his arrival.
Clinton’s proposition came with strings attached. She explained that the U.S. supports the fund only if developing nations will submit to “international scrutiny” surrounding their greenhouse-gas mitigation efforts. We agree that developing nations must reduce their emissions significantly, and call upon China and India to act as leaders among developing nations by agreeing to scrutiny. In fact, it is a shame that these countries have resisted binding emissions targets so far, since they play an ever-more prominent role in the emerging climate crisis. Unfortunately, China and India must embark on a different path to development than Annex II nations forged; unsustainable growth is no longer an acceptable option considering the state of the planet.
While the Obama administration has shown drastic improvement when compared with the country’s previous stance on climate negotiations, the U.S. simply must go further. Considering the conference’s imminent end, failing to act now could lead to a disappointing—and unacceptable—outcome.
Once the conference ends, we strongly urge the U.S. Congress to ratify any agreement that comes of COP15, to avoid an outcome similar to the Kyoto Protocol disappointment. Additionally, in years to come, the U.S. must help ensure that other countries comply with any commitments to which they agree.
For today, however, signing in Copenhagen is the priority. All nations must put pen to paper to ensure that the world moves forward in the fight against climate change.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Trawling the Internet in search of a pick-me-up from the overwhelmingly positive media coverage of Obama, conservatives will perhaps stumble upon shock jock Howard Stern’s archived radio programs from Election 2008. In one infamous episode, Stern chats with several supposedly random Obama supporters in Harlem; their ignorant hero-worship is meant to show that any vote for Obama must be based on race or charisma rather than a substantive platform. Abrasive—and methodologically flawed—as Stern’s approach is, there’s some grain of truth to his conclusions. Obama’s winsome personality can at times override his actual policy proposals; after all, he’s not only a president, but also a family man (globetrotting with photogenic wife and daughters), a sex symbol (bodysurfing shirtless in Hawaii), and a stage presence (snagging a Grammy for his “Audacity of Hope” audiotape). If Dubya was the man polls reported America felt most comfortable relaxing over a beer with, it was because by the end, it was clear that he had flaws and insecurities just like the rest of us. But Obama is more than just a prospective pal—he’s the man America wants to be.
A large part of this allure has depended on his remaining inoffensive, even something of a blank slate. That’s why his Nobel acceptance speech last week came as such a shock, eliciting mixed reactions and media confusion. Speaking before a roomful of diplomats in Oslo, Obama defended sending additional troops into Afghanistan, declaring that the unobjectionable soft -power tactics everyone agrees are important—building strong institutions, defending human rights—are not enough. Many of the raised hackles stemmed from the exquisite irony of using a platform for peace for a defense of war. Yet the disconnect goes still deeper. With more clarity than ever before, Obama’s speech peeled away his slick exterior to reveal the inner workings of his moral universe—a universe that is old-fashioned, even unfashionable, and far more controversial than many of his most ardent admirers realize.
For starters, it’s a world divided starkly between good and evil, with very little of the cultural relativism that most liberals hold as a core tenet. “I do not believe that we will have the will, the determination, the staying power, to complete this work without something more—and that’s the continued expansion of our moral imagination, an insistence that there’s something irreducible that we all share,” argued Obama. In his next breath, he spelled it out explicitly: “As the world grows smaller, you might think it would be easier for human beings to recognize how similar we are, to understand that we’re all basically seeking the same things.” In Obama’s eyes, America is good, and it is its responsibility to spread this goodness so that everyone may achieve the universal ideal of happiness.
The Judeo-Christian overtones here are obvious enough. But to me, at least, Obama’s somewhat oblique reference to the “moral imagination” also recalls the title of Lionel Trilling’s 1950 classic, “The Liberal Imagination.” Writing an introduction to a posthumous collection of Trilling’s essays in 2000, Leon Wieseltier praised the literary critic—along with theologian Reinhold Niebuhr and intellectual historian Isaiah Berlin—for remaining clear-eyed in dark times, a “rationalist with night vision.” It’s worth noting that David Brooks also invokes Niebuhr in a New York Times column this week discussing Obama’s “Christian realism,” and that Obama himself has referred to Niebuhr as his “favorite philosopher.” All the rhetorical overlap can be a little surprising—but the web of tightly-linked references is a clear indicator that we’ve come across a particular approach to looking at the world.
Indeed, Obama’s speech speaks to a real, often ignored, distinction between those who think of the world “morally” and those who don’t. It’s an old canard that lumping things in moral categories necessitates a conservative mindset. Some conservatives think this way, and so do some liberals, like Obama. The latter camp, on the other hand, is not “immoral,” but rather “amoral”—for better or worse, it simply doesn’t see the world through these goggles of good and evil. (As one online commenter on Brooks’ piece put it, the president’s logic is pure “Manichaean claptrap.”) This division in outlook helps explain why some have compared Obama’s speech to Bush’s revamped Manifest Destiny—while policy-wise the two presidents may be apples and oranges, they have something far deeper in common.
What this means is that the months ahead call for us to tread very carefully. The distinction sketched out here between the “moral” view and the “amoral” view is essentially the same as that drawn by another reviewer of Trilling’s book, who divides intellectual life between “fundamentalism” and “relativism.” In his speech, Obama warned that “if you truly believe that you are carrying out divine will, then there is no need for restraint—no need to spare the pregnant mother, or the medic, or the Red Cross worker, or even a person of one’s own faith.” Yet in closing, he declared: “Let us reach for the world that ought to be—that spark of the divine that still stirs within each of our souls.” The line between these two views of the “divine” is incredibly fine, and requires especially delicate consideration.
Trilling’s point in “The Liberal Imagination” was that part of the role of literature is to challenge status quo liberal ideas; while politicians tend to get carried away in abstractions, literature dwells in the details. As Obama continues to unwrap his political philosophy through his actions and words, the lesson that we must temper our admiration with productive criticism remains more potent than ever.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Paradox has long been a watchword of international climate change mitigation efforts. The United Nations Climate Change Conference, ending today in Copenhagen, has so far done more to bolster this notion than it has done to bind nations in new measures to combat our environmental crisis.
As world leaders continue to arrive and make their presence felt (or lack thereof), this final week of the summit has witnessed bizarre contradictions of rhetoric and procedural protocol. Perhaps most disappointing has been the action of ‘the Group of 77,’ a consortium of over 100 small or developing nations with a vast range of geopolitical backgrounds, as well as agendas for the conference. Where the nations seem to agree is on the added difficulty facing poorer or more developing countries that would bear the brunt of many of the measures to mitigate climate change, from protecting forests to limiting use of fossil fuels. Unfortunately, this tenuous union has led to bold and sweeping gestures that may turn the tables on former imperialist nations, but lack actual productive value.
The position taken by Mithika Mwenda of the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance, a South African-based advocacy group at the summit, is particularly troubling. Mithika has implied that efforts such as those of Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi to set up financial compensation for poor countries to enact climate change reforms will “sell out the lives and hopes of Africans for a pittance”—strong words for a leading African minister working toward the same stated goal as PACJA. Yet perhaps Mwenda’s comment aptly calls into question the “hopes” Africans harbor for the summit—is climate change the central issue here, or a symbolic rebalancing of power, a demonstration of Africa’s importance at the cost of global efforts? The Group of 77’s blocking efforts earlier this week would seemingly serve that objective better than one of progress in climate reform.
The same nations complaining of obstruction, however, are themselves (surprise, surprise) guilty of adding hot air to the debate. Great Britain’s climate secretary Ed Miliband made headlines in England for his acknowledgment of the obvious: “People will be rightly furious if agreement [at the conference] is not possible.” His countryman Tony Blair has chimed in as well, demanding a hasty resolution. Yet the EU has pledged less than $10 billion to short-term climate aid for developing nations. To put that in perspective, Japan has individually promised $15 billion. Miliband might do better to work on solutions than to make sweeping remarks to the world press.
As for China and the United States, the largest, most petulant children in this mess of a summit sandbox? Paradoxical practices have plagued their policies as well. China has publicly complained about the “lack of transparency” on the part of Denmark, the summit’s host nation, in its composition of the talks. Yet China has raised obstructive technical objections to specific lines of text throughout the week—eerily similar to the personal account of China’s actions at last year’s climate talks in Paris, shared with me by a prominent scientist who served in the U.S. delegation there. If China is up to its old tricks, calls for greater transparency seem, at best, confused.
Perhaps the most astounding public assertion of Copenhagen has come from an unlikely source, Senator John F. Kerry (D-Mass.). Kerry, receiving applause from the packed assembly hall, promised of the United States that, “100 percent, we are going to pass major climate and energy legislation that is going to have an impact on emissions.” One does not have to look very far into issues up for debate in Congress to recognize the boldness of this claim, in the midst of a bitter deadlock over health-care reform and the maddening twists of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) Lieberman himself would be a strong candidate for the prize of highest unintentional irony in a public statement for some of his recent comments, but for now his fellow Yale graduate Kerry has done enough. The notion that in such a polarized, anything-goes political climate any legislation would be a “100 percent” guarantee seems grandiose.Specify the legislation is on climate-related fuel emissions? To put it mildly, that will not improve the bill’s odds.
President Obama and other world leaders can salvage tangible progress out of the Copenhagen conference today—but the odds have been stacked heavily against their success. Maintaining uniform, reasonable policies will help nations work toward climate-mitigation success. Sweeping statements unmatched by actions, however, will simply spray more carbon dioxide into the embattled atmosphere, not work to protect it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Public opinion plays like a broken record. As the New Jersey bill to legalize same-sex marriage floats and flounders in the state legislature, I can’t help feeling that I’ve heard the same sound-bite arguments from supporters and detractors a million times. Groups with names like Garden State Equality and Progressive Change Committee Campaign decry empty promises of the pursuit of happiness and the withholding of individual rights. They yell and scream across the aisle at the Council on the American Family and the Coalition to Preserve and Protect Marriage, products of the 90s culture wars, which judging by the media clips, continue unabated.
Somewhere in all this mess, it’s become painfully apparent that the camps are talking past each other. In my perspective, advocates for same-sex marriage could go about advancing the message with a bit more tact. Although the proponents of marriage equality have made tremendous strides—achievements should be rightfully recognized and applauded—we must now engage socially-conservative opponents on their own turf. In addition to emphasizing the case for same-sex marriage in terms of individual freedom and rights, we must add community-oriented dimensions to the message. Progressives need to stress that same-sex marriage won’t erode institutions conservatives hold dear—in fact, it might very well strengthen them.
It’s difficult for young progressives to contemplate that the case for same-sex marriage might be cast more persuasively outside the cheap vocabulary of political liberalism. There’s a reason for this. Bread-and-butter arguments for a mere “live and let live” policy are easy to understand and easy to preach. But they’re also the least persuasive.
So long as same-sex marriage opponents claim a monopoly on protecting the common good, preserving family values, and tightening the social fabric of America, the movement for same-sex marriage will have trouble making headway. Yet we can garner more popular support by stressing that there is something beneficial for society about marriage and that these benefits are present in wedlock whether it’s between heterosexual or homosexual Americans.
Many liberals are uncomfortable with the state taking an explicit stance on what is viewed as a primarily private moral matter. After all, “keep the government out of our bedrooms” is a slogan that’s won many a vote in the past. Yet the state has always had its hand in the cookie jar. In fact, in Hillary Goodridge v. Department of Public Health—the case that first amplified the same-sex marriage debate at the onset of the decade—the Massachusetts Supreme Court legally contended that marriage serves a crucial function of the general welfare: It anchors society by promoting stable relationships over transient ones, provides for the orderly distribution of property, and ensures that adults and children are cared for and supported by private funds rather than state coffers. American government has long been unabashedly pro-marriage.
The current political landscape is particularly fertile for a community-oriented message in favor of same-sex marriage. Marriage of any kind is in a crisis. Almost half of all marriages end in divorce, and the institution itself is treated as contingent and casual. If anything is dramatically eroding the ties that bind us, it’s more likely the broken promises between heterosexual citizens than the affinities between homosexual citizens. A culture of instant gratification tells couples to separate when their needs are not momentarily met. Although legalizing same-sex marriage will certainly not alleviate the problems that beset heterosexual marriages, it seems strange for social conservatives to advocate against reinforcing interpersonal relationships through the bonds of matrimony. At the end of the day, those who are worried about the disintegration of the American social fabric should be supporting same-sex marriage rather than fighting against it.
Many on the fence in the same-sex marriage debate remain unconvinced that same-sex marriages will provide the same public benefits as heterosexual marriages. According to Clayton W. Brooks III ’10, former Political Chair of Harvard BGLTSA: “One of the biggest barriers to same-sex marriage advocacy is the stereotyped image that’s been given to same-sex couples. There are very few public same-sex couples which mainstream Americans families feel comfortable identifying with. Gay couples tend to be viewed as more promiscuous and less stable, which makes them less appealing to the family values crowd.” In order to counter this stereotype, advocates should advance a pro-family image of same-sex couples strengthening the institution of marriage—a picture in direct contrast to the one painted by same-sex marriage opponents.
Today, folks of many political stripes are worried about the primacy of private choice: Many citizens seem to loosely choose lifestyles, cultural affinities, and identities like favorite sports teams. These liberties are sweet, but many Americans, especially the crowd that opposes same-sex marriage because of its supposed links to promiscuity and broken families, are looking for something more stable. Those same Americans should consider it harmful that two people of any gender who claim to love each other do not solidify their love publicly through the institution of marriage. And they certainly shouldn’t support the creation of second-class families.
All in all, champions of marriage equality would be wise to illuminate the many parts of the American dream that support the cause. Individual liberty and the pursuit of happiness are two relevant themes. But so is the idea of communities and families who, despite their differences, recognize each others’ contributions to the general welfare and the need for mutual respect.

Students authorized to stay on campus during the upcoming three-week January term will not be allowed to hold parties or host guests—including fellow Harvard students not among the 1,316 cleared to stay—according to an statement e-mailed to The Crimson yesterday by Interim Director of Advising Programs Inge-Lise Ameer.
The rules, which have not yet been officially released to students, come in addition to the normal expectations for student conduct as outlined in the student handbook, Ameer wrote in the statement.
“We hope that these guidelines will help facilitate a productive January for those students who will be on campus,” Ameer wrote.
According to Lowell House Master Diana L. Eck, the rules stem from the fact that the January “J-Term” is technically a break from school during which students are privileged to stay on campus.
Students who are on campus have been granted access “by virtue of special petition,” she said. “[It is] considered to be a time to be working.”
In addition, there will be a reduced number of resident tutors on campus to supervise students, Eck said.
“We do not have our normal resources in place, so there will be zero tolerance for parties, guests, or unapproved students being here,” wrote Adams Allston Burr Resident Dean Sharon L. Howell in an e-mail about J-term to Adams residents yesterday evening. “Students who do not uphold expectations related to conduct will be asked to leave, and may lose the privilege of having Winter Break housing in the future.”
Ameer said she plans to notify students staying over J-Term of these additional rules by e-mail next week.
The three-week January term represents a new provision under the altered academic calendar which then-interim University President Derek C. Bok approved in 2007, and which was instituted this year. While the College initially planned to provide programming during the January period, budgetary concerns precluded that option, leading administrators to instead institute an application process to approve athletes, researchers, and thesis writers needing to stay on campus over the break.
Some students have expressed consternation about the rules for those staying on campus, which they say signal unnecessarily harsh precautions. Caitlin J. Rowland ’12, who will stay on campus to train with the women’s basketball team, said she first heard of the rules from her teammates on Wednesday.
“I’m frustrated with the fact that they’re trying to make it so difficult for family members to stay,” said Rowland, who added that many teammates had originally planned to host relatives during J-Term.  She was also disappointed about the restrictions on social life.
“[They are] trying to make it more difficult for us to have parties in the dorms,” said Rowland. “I think that’s a really big inconvenience.”
Jeremy L. Hsu ’11, who will continue his science research over J-Term, acknowledged the problem of having less tutor supervision during the break, but still felt the restrictions were excessive.
“If they trust us enough to be here, they should let students be able to have fun responsibly,” Hsu said.
“It definitely hurts the credibility of the [College’s] commitment to extend full student privileges to people who want to stay during J-Term,” said Vikas Lonakadi ’10, who is staying to work on his economics senior thesis.
Other students were less concerned about the College’s decision. “To be honest, I don’t see what the big deal is,” said Maxim M. Kenyi ’12, who will be on campus with the men’s basketball team.
“While I’m personally disappointed that J-Term will not be one long extended orgy for the 1,316 students staying in Harvard housing over J-Term, I think it’s reasonable for Harvard to prioritize safety during its J-Term,” wrote Undergraduate Council President Johnny F. Bowman ’11. He added that the UC will work to advocate in favor of reduced restrictions for future J-Terms.
During J-Term, only students authorized to be on campus will have access to Houses, dorms, Annenberg dining hall, and gyms. University Health Services and libraries will remain open during their normal hours, and shuttle schedules will maintain their term-time schedules.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Red dominates his office. Red plush carpet, red pillows, red picture frame.
“Red stimulates the appetite,” says English Professor Matthew B. Kaiser.
But Kaiser’s not the only one with a large appetite. His Literature and Sexuality class has upperclassmen hungering to join. And after only its second year in the course catalog, English 154: Literature and Sexuality has drawn nearly 500 students this semester—a number normally associated with mandatory introductory classes like Social Analysis 10.
Students say they flock to the class, which is billed as a survey of 300 years of an “uneasy alliance between—and intertwining histories of—literature and sexuality,” for its distinctive curriculum, Kaiser’s charismatic lecturing style, and to fulfill a Core requirement.
But behind Kaiser’s subject matter lies a personal history of witnessing oppression that has led him to study Victorian literature as works that were written in a time of deep political upheaval.
“Sexuality is such a central organizing logic of human subjectivity in the modern era, that you need to know about it to make sense of oneself,” Kaiser says. “There’s a lot of violence and injustice perpetuated in the US because of sexuality.”
SEXUALITY
Kaiser began his path to English 154 as a student at the University of Oregon, where he observed homophobic acts against local gay teenagers and young adults.
At the time, the future faculty member says he was uninterested in academic work. He added that the University of Oregon was the only college to which he applied, in large part because of its one-page application. Fighting against homophobic activity became a focus during his freshman year.
That year, voters in Oregon debated Measure 9, which categorized homosexuality as “abnormal, wrong, unnatural, and perverse” and would have amended the state constitution to provide legal protection for homophobic actions. The measure was eventually defeated by a margin of 13 percent, and the debate prompted violent homophobic acts of violence and harassment against gay youth.
“Young gay kids were being killed by skinheads,” Kaiser recalls. “Coming from San Francisco, I was startled by the violence of it and the vulnerability of, especially, gay kids in that environment.”
In protest, Kaiser says he joined the countrywide “queer nation”—a queer rights movement that grew in the early and mid 90s—to counter the violent acts, even taking it upon himself to surreptitiously spray paint “a queer was bashed here” wherever he heard of a homophobic act had taken place.
“I had a stencil cut out of from the bottom of the box,” Kaiser says. “And when no one was looking, I would set it down on the ground and take a can of spray paint and spray it inside the box. It just looked like I was fiddling around in the box.”
As his social activism continued, Kaiser says he began questioning
the reasons underlying the violence against which he was protesting.
LITERATURE
Hoping to make sense of his experience, Kaiser says he made a “productive and life-transforming connection” in the second half of his sophomore year to pursue academia in order to provide a theory behind both that violence and his attempts to stop it.
Kaiser says this love developed when he declared his major in English, the discipline in which he found answers in Victorian literature.
“Victorian literature is concerned with suffering and violence of social interest,” Kaiser says. “It provided a terrific laboratory in which to theorize the nature of violence.”
After graduation, Kaiser matriculated at Rutgers University, where he pursued a doctorate in English.
“He was always a brilliant graduate student,” says Rutgers Professor of English Carolyn Williams, who was on Kaiser’s dissertation committee.
Williams in particular praised the originality of Kaiser’s work on the “ludicrous,” which sought to discover what was funny, playful, absurd, or irrational in the highly serious Victorian period.
While at Rutgers, Kaiser taught three classes that served both as early versions of English 154 and as part of the expansion of the Rutgers’ Women’s Studies Department into gender studies. He says he hoped the course would make gender studies “palatable” to undergraduates.
Many students, according to Williams, say that Kaiser’s class on “Theory of Gender and Sexuality” at Rutgers was the best they took during their time there.
“I would recommend this course to anyone and everyone. I think it should be required,” one student wrote in his evaluation.
“The world is a different place to me now,” wrote another.
His class, which also included middle-aged students, taught Kaiser to treat his students like adults—a strategy he later brought to English 154.
THE ‘AND’
Most of the texts that Kaiser incorporates in Literature and Sexuality seem “vulgar for the sake of being vulgar,” he says.
“But beneath what seems crude is actually quite philosophically profound,” he added.
The course also attempts to uncover the deeper meaning of these texts, many of which are actually powerful reflections of the norms of societies, Kaiser says.
The Story of the Eye, in particular, was “pretty brutal and pornographic,” Matthew Rienzo ’11 says.
Not all of Kaiser’s students shared that sentiment. Kelly Bodwin ’11 questioned whether the novel was over-pornographasized.
“I don’t think the sex in the book was important to the meaning or the plot. It was just pornographic,” Bodwin says.
“I think it’s important to introduce students to erotica and pornographic texts, especially because we live in such a ‘pornographisized’ society,” Kaiser says. “If I talk about sex only using high-brow discourse, I would be doing the students a disservice.”
Rienzo says that Kaiser’s lectures are particularly engaging because of his ability to find the meaning in the graphic novels that the students read and because of his knack of presenting his thoughts accessibly.
“When I went into the class, I saw the graphic videos and texts as just titillating,” Iris Lee ’12 says. “It was novel. But later in the class, Professor Kaiser explains how sexuality was taking sex too seriously.”
Sex, Kaiser explains, is merely a “biological act.”
On the other hand, “sexuality is the cultural weight and meaning that is placed upon that act,” Kaiser says.
This difference, according to Head Teaching Fellow R.J. Jenkins, informs the curriculum of the class.
“The course is structured in such a way that you basically have novels that are pro-sexuality and novels that are anti-sexuality, and they are presented in that way,” Jenkins says. “However, Professor Kaiser states explicitly that he is anti-sexuality.”
“Sexuality as a concept is very detrimental has led to violence, injustice, prejudice,” Jenkins added. “That agenda is masked as Kaiser talks about pro-sexuality novels.”
Jenkins attributes part of the class’s success with students to its relevance, as “sexuality is such a common topic every day.”
“Sex makes for a great course material. Sex makes for great reading,” Jenkins says. “There’s a running joke in English departments—you’ll double enrollment if you put ‘sex’ in your title.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility released its 2009 report yesterday detailing the University’s voting decisions on 19 shareholder proposals regarding issues of social responsibility, ranging from climate change to animal welfare.
The University, which has invested billions of dollars in shares of publicly traded corporations, votes by proxy each year on various proposals put forth by other shareholders, concerning corporate governance matters and social issues.
Harvard has considered over 100 such resolutions almost every year this past decade, but only voted on 19 this year “due to changes in asset allocation in effect during the 2009 proxy season.”
Six of the shareholder proposals that Harvard considered this year dealt with oil and gas corporation Exxon Mobil.
The CCSR voted in favor of proposals calling on the company to develop renewable energy alternatives and adopt sexual orientation anti-bias policies, but opposed requests for additional reporting on executive compensation policies.
The CCSR voted to abstain on a resolution asking Exxon Mobil to adopt “quantitative goals” for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
An Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibility—a 12-member group composed of faculty, students, and alumni—analyzes Harvard’s proxy issues and makes recommendations to
the CCSR on how the University ought to vote its shares. The ACSR and CCSR handle issues of social responsibility, while the Harvard Management Company—which oversees the University’s endowment—addresses proposals regarding corporate governance.
University spokesman John D. Longbrake declined to elaborate on the CCSR report and Harvard’s proxy voting.
The CCSR voted in favor of the disclosure of The Boeing Company’s foreign military sales and calls for PepsiCo to increase container recovery and recycling.
Meanwhile, the CCSR voted in opposition to the adoption of universal health care reform principles by pharmaceutical company Abbott Labs.
The CCSR voted to abstain on proposals calling for five companies to provide additional reports on political contributions and expenditures, and to identify employees who helped to make such contribution decisions.
Earlier in the decade, the CCSR recommended that the University divest itself of stock held in PetroChina Company and Sinopec Corporation due to concerns about the oil companies’ ties with the Sudanese government and the ongoing Darfur humanitarian crisis in the country.
The CCSR currently consists of three members of the Harvard Corporation: Robert D. Reischauer ’63, James R. Houghton ’58, and Patricia A. King.
Senior Fellow Houghton announced earlier this week that he would be stepping down from the six-person Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—at the end of the academic year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After serving as a Harvard professor for almost 15 years, renowned Dante scholar Lino Pertile will assume the directorship of the Harvard University Center for Italian Renaissance Studies at Villa I Tatti in Florence, Italy, next summer, the University announced Wednesday.
“I’m looking forward to sharing my life with the fellows and staff of Villa I Tatti, working with these people and taking advantage of the extraordinary sources that the Villa offers in Renaissance studies,” Pertile said in an interview with The Crimson.
Pertile announced in November that he and his wife would step down as Eliot House Masters in June, but he said that decision was unrelated to this newest appointment.
Pertile will be the center’s seventh director, succeeding History of Art and Architecture professor Joseph J. Connors, who has served as director of I Tatti since 2002.
“[Pertile] will extend warmth of welcome not only to the new fellows each year, but to the many scholars who come back from past years, and others who come to work in the library,” Connors wrote in an e-mail to The Crimson from Italy. “He will be a natural bridge between American and Italian scholarship, as hehas been for his whole career up to now.”
Pertile grew up in a small village in Northeastern Italy and taught in the United Kingdom before coming to Harvard. In the 41 years since he last lived in Italy, he has been known as a Dante scholar, professor, House Master, and even “the Godfather.”
“To some extent, the role does color and shape the life and the style of the person,” Pertile said. “To that extent, I’m changing, but I’m always changing the role itself. The role is somewhat fixed, but it requires the color and the personality of the person who happens to be invested in that role [to change it].”
The I Tatti center was bequeathed to Harvard in 1959 by art critic and connoisseur Bernard Berenson ’1887, according to Connors. Villa I Tatti offers fellowships to scholars in the “early phase of their careers” for up to about a decade after they earn their doctoral degrees to allow them to pursue independent research.
I Tatti is an academic community of roughly 30 scholars that includes full-year fellows, three-month fellows, visiting professors, and “readers in the Renaissance,” according to Graziella Macchetta, development associate for the center’s Cambridge office.
Pertile said that what he is looking forward to most in the move to Florence is being able to work with the postdoctoral fellows at the Center.
“I’ll be mixing with young people who are that the peak of their intellectual activity, and so I will [gain] a lot of intellectual energy from them, as well as giving them anything I can give them,” Pertile said. “It’s a marvelous prospect.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an effort to bolster sustainability efforts and cut energy costs, the Harvard College Library system has implemented lighting changes, including installing occupancy sensors and reducing lighting use in campus libraries.
According to an HCL press release, the initiative aims to help the University reach its larger sustainability goals, which include a 30-percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2016 and the implementation of environmentally friendly temperature settings.
“Once President Faust made [sustainability] a priority, we raised our level of awareness and became much more focused as an institution on working together to create a good conservation effort,” said Beth S. Brainard, HCL director of communications.
Several years ago, HCL operations installed a number of occupancy sensors in parts of Widener Library, but another 130 sensors have been added to offices in Widener, Lamont, and Pusey libraries in recent months.
HCL operations have reduced lighting in other areas of the libraries, according to the press statement. Eighty-two lights have been turned off in the Loker Reading Room, resulting in thousands of dollars in savings, and 68 spotlights were dispensed with in the Phillips and stacks reading rooms, which has saved HCL more than $10,000 in annual maintenance fees.
The latest projects—which were initiated by the HCL sector leaders for the University’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Program—also include installing energy-efficient compact fluorescent bulbs and turning off half the lights in the tunnel between Widener and Lamont, according to the release.
“We are keenly aware of the need to conserve energy. While the current budget stringencies are bringing more attention to these savings, the energy conservation issues are a part of a larger commitment,” HCL’s head librarian Nancy M. Cline wrote in an e-mail. “We are of course glad to see the lower operating costs, as this allows us to redirect this money to other priorities.”
HCL’s recent energy-saving, cost-cutting initiatives reflect the University’s current budgetary concerns. Last month, the Task Force on University Libraries released a report, suggesting the possibility of closing some of Harvard’s 73 libraries and reevaluating the University’s ambitious collection strategy, in order to address budgetary pressures.
Concerning its most recent changes, HCL operations examined each library first and then implemented successful changes among all buildings to create a largely uniform conservation effort, according to Brainard.
“Each library is different. For example, Houghton Library contains rare books and manuscripts. Because of the nature of the materials it houses, we can’t follow the same sort of heating and cooling systems that we do in our other libraries,” Brainard said. “We try to set things across the board where it makes sense.”
The recent changes are part of HCL’s history of enhancing its sustainability efforts. Since 1997, the spaces and buildings managed by HCL Operations—the HCL floors of 625 Mass. Ave., and Widener, Houghton, Lamont, Pusey, and Tozzer libraries—have made dozens of changes devoted to energy conservation.
Prior efforts have included the adjustment of library air-conditioning systems to reflect operating hours—a change that cost a little less than $5,000, but one that has been estimated to save more than $40,000 in annual energy costs, according to the press release.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Director Sarah A. Rankin recently traveled to Spain to discuss Harvard’s efforts to combat gender and sexual violence.
Rankin spoke to a group of students and activists at the Universities of Lleida and Barcelona, which are attempting to formulate sexual harassment policies and resources for women who have faced sexual violence and gender inequality.
“Culturally, the way they view the issue is really different,” Rankin said. “They’re starting from a place where I imagine we were a number of years ago.”
She said that the activists in Spain are still trying to convince university policy-makers that change is necessary—a struggle that Harvard graduate student Christopher M. Gilbert says is prevalent on American campuses as well.
“Usually you have to fight with deans and administrators to get support,” said Gilbert, who is involved with efforts on campus to raise awareness about sexual violence and inequality. But he said that Harvard has made an impressive financial commitment to supporting the goals of OSAPR and other similar groups.
Hugo Van Vuuren ’07, a member of MenSpeakUp.org’s graduate board, agreed that many schools are not as proactive as Harvard in fighting gender inequality and sexual violence. MenSpeakUp.org was founded at Harvard in 2008 to address the lack of men advocating for gender equality.
“Organizations like OSAPR and MenSpeakUp play an important role in helping individuals reevaluate their thoughts around these issues and turn passive observers of injustice into active campaigners for equality,” Van Vuuren said.
Gilbert noted that the increased participation of men has significantly advanced the movement combating gender inequality and sexual assault on American college campuses.
“Men want to learn from those around them who may be more sensitive than they are to these issues,” he said. “They are cognizant of the privilege they have and want to use that privilege to fight misogyny and sexual assault.”
Gilbert said that he was particularly impressed that members of sports teams and single-sex clubs at Harvard have been participating in the efforts. The activism of members of the football team, for example, “flies in the face of stereotypes,” he said.
Carl D. Ehrlich ’09, former captain of the Harvard football team and a volunteer with OSAPR, said he was dedicated to using his position as a campus leader to facilitate discussion on what he said is a universal issue.
“Getting involved is not an admission of guilt,” he said. “It’s being willing to step up to the forefront of the issue and getting people to see that it needs attention.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Business Review unveiled a revamped Web site yesterday morning, complementing a recent redesign of its print magazine in what HBR officials have identified as a modernizing effort aimed at increasing the 88-year-old publication’s accessibility.
The changes come less than one year after current HBR editor-in-chief Adi Ignatius joined the organization, bringing with him the knowledge and the journalistic sensibility gleaned from more than a decade on the editorial staff at Time magazine.
“When Adi came on board, we started thinking of ways to make the content more accessible,” said Harvard Business Review Group Publisher Joshua D. Macht, who said that the tweaks both in print and on the Web were intended to increase the reach of the magazine, which has historically cast itself as a journal for business professionals.
“What you’re starting to see is that we do want to experiment with new ideas and new formats,” Macht said. “We want to have the most impact with our ideas so that we can we can affect big changes with organizations.”
A fully-owned subsidiary of Harvard University that maintains an affiliation with the Business School while remaining editorially independent, HBR realized about 246,000 print subscriptions in the past year.
But increasing hits on the Web site—which took over one million unique hits this past October—prompted the publication’s leaders to consider also how that content’s accessibility might be improved, Macht said.
Among other features, the new site features a navigation bar that distinguishes daily news from more long-term developments in management and business. The design element is to help promote and display greater debate, according to Macht.
To address the redesign project, HBR hired the help of two design consulting firms, both of which said the layout inhibited the communication of content, Macht said.
“Early feedback from faculty members and other readers who’ve glimpsed the issue has been very positive,” he said. “It’s much more dynamic.”
The December-January issue is due on newsstands sometime next week, featuring a graphic and redesigned logo on the cover, and infographics inside to break up articles. The publication has also redefined its content, featuring a “Spotlight” section, which will focus on “Reinvention” for the upcoming issue.
The magazine underwent its last major redesign in 1990-1992 when Theodore Levitt, who would later be noted for increasing the publication’s circulation, joined as editor.
But those changes were not as dramatic as the current ones, Macht said.
“The table of contents were still on the cover,” he said of the prior redesign, referencing one of formerly defining marks of the publication until this issue’s overhaul.
The concurrent revamp of both the Web site and the print magazine serves as part of an effort to create administrative linkages, replacing a sharp divide between the two worlds with unified “thought teams” specializing in certain issues, according to Macht.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When University President Drew G. Faust landed in China in March 2008, the self-professed connoisseur of ethnic foods had already made up her mind to sample the explosion of exotic flavors that characterizes local Chinese cuisine.
Instead, her most memorable dining experience was marked by a live fish leaping out of a large tray and flopping helplessly on the floor near her table.
“It was unexpected,” she says in retrospect.
The shock of someone’s dinner protesting its fate is only one of the many surprises—some more pleasant than others—Faust has experienced during her trips abroad.
This year, Faust has resumed her travels at a greater intensity than she did during her first year in office, seeking to promote Harvard’s brand and partnerships overseas while also taking time to visit girls’ high schools abroad.
“I think it’s very important for university presidents in this international day and age to reach out beyond their own country and their own campus,” Faust says.
A FIRST FOR FAUST
Over Thanksgiving weekend, Faust added another item to her list of “firsts”: taking a whirlwind tour of South Africa and Botswana. With her visit to the African continent, Faust became the second Harvard president to travel to Africa. Landing in Johannesburg after 24 hours in transit, Faust took a fleeting overview of the University’s expanding presence in the continent—several HIV/AIDS research partnerships, a long-standing fellowship program, and a pool of about 1,000 alumni in South Africa to schmooze.
The University took advantage of Faust’s visit to build new relationships in the region, as well as to cultivate existing ties. Faust chose to deliver her keynote address at the Soweto Campus of the University of Johannesburg, located in a former segregated neighborhood—and a far cry from gentrified Cambridge. A senior Harvard administrator was sent to scope out the area beforehand as an “advance man.”
Once the neighborhood was deemed safe enough to visit, Faust’s trip itinerary featured the campus—and it was there that she announced last month that Harvard and the University of Johannesburg would embark upon a new initiative to train school principals for some of the poorest areas of the country. With collaboration between the Harvard Graduate School of Education and the University of Johannesburg’s Faculty of Education, the program would seek to attract innovators in education to Soweto, the site of a major student protest during the struggle against apartheid.
“School principals are running classrooms in fields and abandoned school buses and shipping containers, sometimes risking their lives to serve students who want to become doctors and civil engineers,” Faust said in her speech.
Faust also attended meetings with administrators at other universities and groups of Harvard alumni in South Africa, participating in broad conversations about higher education and the changes that the nation has undergone in the past two decades. Education is viewed as crucial to the “transformation” of South Africa into a democratic state in a post-apartheid era, Faust says.
“The most powerful part of the experience was seeing this society which had been involved in such an oppressive system and way of life working so assiduously to build democracy, to build racial justice,” she says, describing her conversations with alumni involved in the anti-apartheid struggle as a “window into life” as South African society evolved.
In Botswana, Faust toured an HIV/AIDS prevention initiative led by Harvard School of Public Health professor Myron “Max” Essex, meeting young children who had been born HIV-free to HIV-positive mothers.
“There was a sense of camaraderie among health care professionals and patients, a sense of shared achievement,” Faust says. “Especially when you saw these adorable children.”
‘SIGN OF GOOD FAITH’
Even in financially challenging times, University administrators emphasize the importance of sending the president on trips to distant lands, though it may be necessary to modify specific travel plans. Faust’s trip to Africa was postponed and scaled back from the original itinerary scheduled for spring break this year, which fell in the midst of the drawn-out budgeting process.
In that turbulent economic climate, a trip timed to coincide with a major global alumni conference in Africa and involving an entourage of deans and other staff would have appeared extravagant, not to mention a distraction from tasks at home. Instead, Faust met with smaller groups of alumni and research programs in Africa over a shorter period of time, cutting both financial and personnel demands.
But the presence of the president overseas benefits the University’s relationship with foreign governments and universities in ways that are difficult to quantify, officials say. As much as Faust may learn about the University’s research projects from touring laboratories, for instance, the spotlight shone upon the research centers themselves during her visit alone helps them to thrive.
“Our stature, our status, and the success of our satellite offices depend on high-level attention,” University Provost Steven E. Hyman says.
A gesture of recognition from Faust works wonders to develop relationships with foreign governments, especially in East Asia, says Vice Provost for International Affairs Jorge I. Dominguez. After a successful trip there in March 2008, Faust will return to Asia over spring break, making her way through Japan via bullet train before attending the opening of the Harvard Shanghai Center, a major satellite office in China’s largest city.
In contrast to the relative anonymity enjoyed by a university president in the United States, Harvard presidents often meet with a slew of high-ranking government officials when abroad—including, but not limited to, those who work to promote education. In Botswana, for instance, Faust dined with two former presidents, as well as the Minister of Health.
Outside the country, the Harvard brand remains an undiminished symbol of intellectual achievement, and the president’s interest in international University partnerships serves as part subtle flattery and part a sign of commitment and respect. Faust’s international presence evinces that the University’s top echelons take Harvard’s overseas projects seriously.
“I hope our presence would be a sign of good faith on our part of our engagement,” Faust says.
Obligations at home place natural limits on Faust’s global presence, especially as she says she prefers to travel when classes are not in session. But independent of time constraints, she has expressed a willingness to journey to the four corners of the world, often spontaneously exclaiming during meetings with donors, alumni, and visitors how much she would enjoy a trip to their homeland.
For its part, the overseas Harvard community has responded enthusiastically to her visits. Dominguez describes Faust as a “rock star” who is easily able to attract alumni audiences 10 times larger than the attendance at his events. Hyman, too, says that Faust is in much higher demand than himself—since “no one knows what a provost is.”
Faust may downplay her personal symbolic power, but her identity as both the first female president as well as the president of Harvard lends her an additional cachet. Audiences are eager to hear her perspective on a wide range of issues that combine the personal and professional aspects of her life—fielding the types of questions that may not have been posed to male presidents. Faust has been asked about subjects ranging from girls’ education to the balance between family and career—all increasingly global concerns.
”At Tsinghua University, she gets the sort of question no Harvard male president was ever asked: ‘How do you combine family and career?’” Dominguez recounts. “She gave a very thoughtful answer, began with a laugh, and said, ‘My private life has vanished. I’m living in a fishbowl.’”
Faust’s visits also help to build alumni communities abroad. Through the University’s international connections, faculty in Cambridge have more opportunities to collaborate with foreign universities, students receive exposure to research and internship opportunities abroad, and international alumni remain involved with the University.
Harvard alumni based abroad often feel “very isolated” from their alma mater, Hyman says. Even in Europe, which boasts sizable alumni networks in cities such as London, it is important for the University to make an effort to reach out to graduates.
“She represents the University in ways no one else can,” Dominguez says. “When she travels, there’s really no comparison to anything I would do or anyone else would do.”
AN INTELLECTUAL PURSUIT—ABROAD
Before jetting off to a different time zone, Faust follows a multi-step regimen in preparation for her trips abroad.
A detective fiction aficionado who finds time to read every day, Faust makes a point of soliciting literary recommendations from faculty members and students with ties to countries on her trip itinerary. Books topping her list range from Nelson Mandela’s 700-page autobiography and South African politics writer Leonard Thompson’s “History of South Africa,” to the “No. 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency” novel series set in Gaborone, Botswana.
“I used to be a scholar—I’m used to reading in my field all the time,” the Civil War historian says, gesturing to a pile of books stacked on her Mass. Hall office desk. Faust had left the remaining books on the list at her home in Elmwood, Harvard’s presidential mansion. “These trips provide the occasion for some intellectual input.”
To support her intellectual and cultural immersion efforts, her brother sent her several CDs featuring South African music for her birthday back in September. The strains of gospel and reggae now serenade her at the gym and in the car, she says.
The president’s trips abroad are often packed with meetings, alumni events, and press conferences for 16 hours a day, leaving little room to see the country.
“Her schedule is a killer. I saw her kind of roll her eyes only once,” Dominguez recalls of the time an aide presented her with another meeting request. “It was the equivalent of ‘Give me a break. I agreed to do the schedule, I’m going to do it, but don’t then ask me to do something else. I’m going to collapse the next day—I’m going to be useless.’”
Though sightseeing opportunities are limited to peering out the car window while being chauffeured from meeting to meeting, Faust—generally very low maintenance, aides say—often insists on a museum visit and some downtime to venture to local restaurants for ethnic cuisine.
But many of the catered meals in China, for example, feature continental breakfast items or filet mignon rather than traditional foods, she reflects.
BACK TO GIRLS’ SCHOOL
When Faust ascended to the presidency in October 2007, letters of admiration and hope from young women around the world congratulating her on her achievement poured into Mass. Hall.
“I thought to myself, ‘My goodness, I have an obligation to these young women,’” Faust says. “‘I ought to reach out to these young women when traveling.’”
And she has. On every extended trip, Faust schedules a visit to a local girls’ high school, where she meets with school officials and—in the case of Shanghai No. 3 Girls High School—a group of preselected, well-behaved schoolgirls in uniform. Faust says she was particularly impressed by the student musicians in a traditional Chinese music class she visited.
“I liked the drum section,” she says.
The fledgling tradition reflects Faust’s personal experiences attending girls’ schools and how that shaped “the way I saw the world.” Just before her thirteenth birthday, Faust, who grew up in Virginia, was shipped off to Concord Academy, which was an all-girls boarding school in Massachusetts at the time.
“It was intellectually rigorous and took girls seriously,” Faust says of Concord Academy. “It gave me a kind of purposefulness that just wasn’t available in the Virginia environment.”
Bryn Mawr, her alma mater, offered a similar experience, as the women’s liberal arts college boasted its faculty, Faust says.
Meeting with girls at schools abroad often sheds light on differences between education in the U.S. and in other countries, Faust says.
“They’re very ambitious intellectually and educationally—they were worried about balancing a career and family,” Faust says of the girls in Shanghai. “I talked about how important it was for me, being in a girls’ school, and how that had been a significant part of believing in myself.”

CORRECTION: MAR. 29, 2011
The Dec. 18, 2009 article "Around the World with Faust" incorrectly stated that University President Drew G. Faust was the first Harvard president to visit the African continent. In fact, former University President Derek C. Bok first visited Africa on a trip in 1975.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the Winter Olympics less than two months away, the US women’s hockey team is set, and three Harvard skaters will be making the trip to Vancouver.
Angela Ruggiero ’02-’04, Julie Chu ’06-’07, and Caitlin Cahow ’07-’08 are among the 21 players on the Olympic roster, which was released Thursday.
The Harvard alums have each been to at least one Games previously, with Ruggiero, a defenseman, a veteran of every American squad since women’s hockey became an Olympic sport in 1998.
Chu, a forward, made the team in 2002 and 2006, while Cahow, a defenseman, played for the US in 2006.
The Vancouver Games begin on Feb. 12 and the American team opens preliminary play on Feb. 14 against China. The US will enter the Olympics with a No. 1 world ranking, having won the last two world titles.
The Americans' main rival in Vancouver will be Canada, the two-time defending Olympic champion. Jennifer Botterill ’01-’03 and Sarah Vaillancourt ’08-’09, both Olympic veterans, are competing for spots on the Canadian roster.
Ruggiero, Chu and Cahow will face off against the ECAC All-Star team—including Crimson skaters co-captain Cori Bassett, senior Anna McDonald, and junior Kate Buesser—in an exhibition game on Jan. 3 at Quinnipiac.

We all know that missed connections suck. You see that special someone in Lamont cafe, getting a latte. The stars have aligned. Except that your Math 23 pset suddenly seems a lot less intimidating than...face-to-face flirting. Aack.
Well Harvard, you're not alone. Eli's down on his luck, too. Find out about the lack of lovin' at Yale after the jump.
ISawYouHarvard.com, which was created by a CS50 student, has taken Harvard by storm, thousands of "I saw you"s have populated the site since it was launched a week ago.
But as HarvardFML.com spawned the knock off YaleFML.com, it was a only matter of time before the lovelorn bulldogs followed with GoodCrushYale.com (at least they were more creative with the title).
FlyBy perused the site to find some unexpected gems:
"You look like Guy Pearce and even though I think you're gorgeous my friends completely disagree," wrote one user. "What do they know? You look kinda crazy too. But not in a sociopathic way."
And like some Yale students, the posts vary from the simply strange to the delightfully sappy:
"You're the smartest person in my English class, by far." wrote another user. "I sat next to you sometimes, but never said a word to you. Your brilliant comments and the way your hair falls across your forehead are what got me through the semester."
Awwwwww. There's nothing quite like (bulldog) puppy love.
