“I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked.”
***
Sylvia Plath is seen as a martyr by many young women. For many, both her life and death are a casualty of a system designed against her — a world where, despite her tremendous potential as a poet and literary luminary, her talent was constrained by sexist attitudes during the time that she was alive. Her story is indicative of women’s potentials not being taken seriously enough, of a sexist society hindering an exceptionally talented woman. In the decades since Plath’s death, her work and life have been re-examined, her legacy shaped by the subsequent waves of social change that have since taken place.
Plath was born in Boston in 1932 and lived close to the city for many years of her life. She attended Smith College, and during her time there, she excelled academically while experiencing mental health turbulence. After graduating summa cum laude, Plath moved to England on a Fulbright scholarship, where she met the poet Ted Hughes, who would later become her husband. In 1962, she wrote many of the poems which would become part of her notable poetry collection “Ariel.” In February of 1963, Plath died by suicide at 30 years old.
Plath was bright and ambitious — I can see why many equally bright and ambitious young women relate so deeply to her. When I think about her college years, consisting of both success and disappointment, I feel a deep sense of sadness for what was yet to come for her.
I encounter a similar twinge of sadness when I read her work, despite the optimism many of her pieces contain. Plath’s work is expansive, capturing so much of what she, and likely other women during her time, felt. From “The Colossus,” published in 1960, to “The Bell Jar,” published in 1963, she forged a multiverse of yearning, hope, and loss. Throughout the 60s, as second-wave feminism brought women into the streets to protest for reproductive rights and equal rights, her work — especially her unfiltered lens into feminine ambition and talent — was revolutionary.
Although we may speculate about Plath’s life, and what exactly she might have been motivated by, she is still a stranger to me. There is something weird about animating historical figures and thinking about them in terms of modern day societal expectations. Even though I may relate to Plath’s journey of ambition, she is still someone I can never truly know. The best I can do is to look at the legacy of what she has left behind and try to make sense of it.
When I think about Plath and her work, I often think about potential: the potential she had to forge a long career as a writer, and see herself win a Pulitzer when she was still alive. Plath’s allegory of the fig tree, detailed in “The Bell Jar,” is a perfect example of this idea of unrealized potential. In the allegory, the protagonist recounts sitting atop a fig tree, each branching fig representing a different path in life, a different thing she wants for herself. The story is relatable but disappointing, because her main character thinks that she must choose only one path instead of feeling empowered to try to pursue all of her interests and passions wholly.
Like Plath, many of my peers on campus are talented, ambitious, and extremely smart women, including some of my closest friends. Like the protagonist in “The Bell Jar,” we see so many futures for ourselves. I want all of us to succeed, and be able to walk down all of the branching paths we have envisioned, instead of feeling like we must only ever choose one.
When I put myself in the shoes of the woman sitting atop the fig tree, I see so many things I want to accomplish; so many new things I want to try, so many new skills I want to learn. I see a world so big and inviting, wonderful futures that beckon and wink.
Women deserve self-determinism in all they want to learn and pursue; they deserve to feel like they have the whole world at their fingertips, the ability to accomplish all of their dreams and hopes. Sylvia Plath would have been 90 years old if she was still alive today. How much more could she have done with all of that time?
Here’s to you, Sylvia, and your fig tree.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the past decade, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has quietly charged ahead with a slate of progressive improvements to student and employee transportation benefits. To deliver on its sustainability and climate commitments, MIT has made public transit completely free for employees and introduced large discounts for Bluebike memberships and MBTA passes for students.
Meanwhile, on this side of Cambridge, transportation benefits have stagnated or actually gotten worse. Harvard still doesn’t subsidize transit passes at all for undergrads, and the University-wide Bluebike discount has actually shrunk since 2013.
As a result, MIT students and employees enjoy superior benefits that enable convenient, sustainable commutes and travel around campus.
MIT students, for example, have access to more affordable Bluebike membership pricing ($45 vs. $98 at Harvard) and bigger MBTA pass discounts (50 percent vs. an average of approximately 14 percent at Harvard), along with a more expansive shuttle network. The disparity is no less dramatic for faculty and staff benefits: MIT has long offered completely free MBTA passes to all employees along with bike commuter benefits that are more flexible than Harvard’s.
MIT is practicing what it preaches when it comes to institutional climate policy. Unfortunately, Harvard cannot say the same. Our institution’s inaction undermines the credibility of its commitment to protecting the climate, leaving our neighbors in the community worse off in the process.
Transportation benefits that reward riding public transit, walking, and cycling reduce car use and steer people towards more sustainable transportation options. The livable communities that prioritize these non-driving modes tend to be healthier, safer, more affordable, and more beautiful.
In the absence of useful transportation benefits, students and employees are destined to stay reliant on cars. Indeed, in 2022, the percentage of Harvard commuters coming to campus via car was higher than it ever was before the pandemic. This is a failure that is well within the Harvard administration’s capacity to correct. It seems, however, that they currently lack the will.
And positive steps from Harvard could go a long way. Employees and students in Massachusetts face skyrocketing housing costs so severe that many are giving up on the region altogether. Policies encouraging walking, cycling, and transit use would mitigate the effects of the cost of living crisis by increasing the geographic area in which affiliates can live and still participate fully in campus life.
Harvard’s tremendous power in Cambridge and Boston comes with an obligation to act in the interests of the broader community. The City of Cambridge has moved aggressively to prioritize progressive transportation policies that make low-carbon, safe, and affordable travel possible. Harvard’s inaction, in addition to depriving its own affiliates of necessary benefits, flies in the face of these community efforts.
So, why hasn’t Harvard, an institution that claims addressing climate change is core to its mission, taken more decisive steps? Inaction on transportation benefits, unfortunately, seems in line with the track record of the Office for Sustainability, which still hasn’t provided an update to the 2015–2020 climate plan that lapsed without a replacement two years ago.
Transportation benefits, however, are an area where the University can make targeted, swift changes to policy in the near-term. The success of MIT’s program settles the question of feasibility. Harvard’s decentralized administration might be a hurdle to implementation, but it’s not an acceptable excuse for inaction. If Harvard’s outdated organizational structures leave it helpless to address twenty-first century challenges, the structures must be changed.
What should Harvard’s action look like? MIT has laid out a compelling blueprint, which Harvard should emulate. But Harvard should go further.
Harvard should provide fully subsidized MBTA passes for all employees and students, taking advantage of a program allowing institutions to pay after the fact for trips taken by affiliates. It should also integrate Charlie Card technology in all Harvard ID cards, not just those of undergraduates.
But the T isn’t convenient for all commuters. Harvard should provide fully subsidized Bluebike memberships and invest in more stations to increase capacity and bolster the campus network. The University should also stop forcing employees to choose between bike and transit benefits, and expand shuttles to include thoughtful services like MIT’s grocery store and airport routes.
Finally, Harvard should be more willing to take bold action at the University level. The current lack of a University-wide policy requires 13 schools to evaluate transportation benefits separately, which is inefficient and confusing. Developing sustainable transportation policy at the University level will maximize the leverage that Harvard's scale provides.
Administrators can and must act on each of these recommendations immediately. If Harvard begins the next academic year without a renewed set of sustainable transportation policies in place, it will suggest deep administrative dysfunction and lack of a meaningful commitment to the climate and to Harvard’s neighbors in the community.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The pandemic will certainly be remembered as one of the most significant events of our lifetimes. It should also be remembered as a time when society lost its head.
We’re not here to criticize the way universities and governments handled the pandemic. After all, it was a period of intense uncertainty with lives on the line; many decision-makers did the best they could with the information they had at the time. Besides, there’s now plenty of literature dedicated to analyzing the policymaking missteps during the pandemic in extreme detail — and multiple pandemic policy-related courses at Harvard.
But this focus on the tactical mistakes made by faceless, behemoth institutions ignores the larger human dynamic at play. The more troubling story of the pandemic — and one that we must acknowledge — is the way that society steamrolled over this uncertainty and enforced adherence to a single, majority view. Particularly for us, as students of a university that has truth in its motto, this turn to dogmatism above critical thinking should be unacceptable.
Take the debate over the origin of the coronavirus, a story that has gained heightened attention in past months after the United States Department of Energy and the FBI stated, with low to moderate levels of confidence, that the pandemic most likely emerged from a lab leak.
For the majority of the pandemic, however, this position was so broadly attacked that outwardly expressing it was taboo. In February 2020, 27 scientists penned a statement in the Lancet, a top medical journal, in which they wrote, “We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin.” The World Health Organization’s investigative team chair said the theory was “extremely unlikely” and “isn’t a hypothesis we suggest implies further study.” Discussions of the theory on Facebook were at one point taken down and kept from spreading. The New York Times called the idea one that “has been largely considered a fringe theory.”
We still don’t know where the coronavirus came from — we might never definitively know. But this is a fairly cut-and-dry case of pandemic madness: The lab leak theory was taken seriously by many reasonable people, well-educated on the topic — and with no strong evidence to the contrary, it was dismissed and censored for years. And many of us participated.
The national discourse around the vaccine roll-out was similarly crazed. Vaccine campaigns emphasized the selfishness inherent in passing up the vaccine and putting high-risk populations in danger. Those campaigns successfully suppressed even sensible vaccine skepticism, such as unease over rare but severe side effects. People who expressed concerns were portrayed as having little care for anyone but themselves. How could they, in good conscience, forgo a vaccine that would prevent infection and its resulting negative externalities?
This argument is sensible, but it was taken too far.
It’s now evident that the vaccines pose legitimate areas of investigation. There’s a lively debate about whether mRNA-based coronavirus vaccines increase the — albeit rare — risk of heart inflammation, particularly for young males. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have even noted considerations for clinicians given this risk.
Additional questions about specific vaccines appeared. The CDC ultimately downgraded their recommendation of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine after reports of the heightened risk of blood clots — even as these cases were highly rare: 60 cases were reported and nine people died. In a similar vein, given the mixed conclusions of research on the effectiveness of subsequent booster shots, there might be a threshold at which the varied side effects of continued boosting outweigh the protection from infection.
This shouldn’t be misunderstood as a vindication of the skeptics. These are each complicated questions that the scientific community will continue to study for years to come. Rather, the point is that we missed out on having these conversations at all — or, rather, having them productively.
Some people who voiced concerns were bullied and forced to leave their jobs. This only inflamed the fury of the right-wing skeptics, potentially jeopardizing the credibility of other health messaging. And the enforcer of these social norms was not some amorphous thing out there — it was us.
Let’s call a spade a spade: Regardless of your view on who is right and who is wrong, this was a dark period of discourse in this country, one that blatantly turned away from truth-seeking.
What was particularly peculiar during the pandemic was not just the groupthink effect — a weaker version of this manifests itself somewhat regularly — but just how quickly the mob moved from one dogma to the next, sometimes in direct contradiction with the last. You get the feeling of whiplash, being pulled from one slogan (don’t trust Trump’s rushed vaccine) to the next (vaccine skepticism is anti-science). The science was messy, while the narratives were easy.
The pandemic forced us to make quick, important decisions with very little information. The rational response would be to be critical of our beliefs and measured in our actions.
Instead, some combination of action bias, fear, and group polarization pushed us in the complete opposite direction. We chose to have weak opinions, strongly held.
In our eyes, the pandemic was the first time we saw reasonable people with reasonable ideas be terrified of speaking out. A survey of the most catastrophic events in human history typically rhymes with this description — this should be alarming.
In short, we saw some of our worst instincts poke their head out during the pandemic. It’s important to interrogate what we believed, remember why we believed it, and honestly investigate if, based on the information at the time, that was the right decision.
It’s not a fun exercise — it takes us back into a sort of bad dream — but it’s crucial to prevent another slow slip into mob morality.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tufts University professor and author Gregory Carleton discussed how Russian historical myths contribute to Russian exceptionalism and the rationale for its invasion of Ukraine at a seminar Tuesday evening.
Harvard’s Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies hosted the talk, which was moderated by Edythe Haber, professor emerita at the University of Massachusetts Boston.
Carleton, a member of Tufts’ Department of International Literary and Cultural Studies, said Russia’s past military legacy formed its “sense of exceptionalism,” which represents a key part of the nation’s cultural identity today.
According to Carleton, the nation’s exceptionalism is grounded in Russian war myth, which celebrates “defense” in conflict and “the legacy of invasion.”
He added this portrayal of history “always puts Russia on the side of the good” and allows the nation to frame its actions as “always responding to foreign aggression, not committing it.”
Even the Russian language, per Carleton, reflects the nation’s defense of its perceived land claims. He explained the Russian affix “Род” — meaning “birth” and “kinship” — appears in the Russian words “Родина,” or “the land that gave birth,” and “народ,” or “people.”
According to Carleton, this etymology illustrates the “organic connection between land and people,” indicating a “longstanding legacy that the defense of the land is a sacred act.”
Russian myth describes the recurring pattern of Russia overcoming invasions, according to Carleton.
“Russian exceptionalist history is very much cyclical,” he added, whereas “Americans tend to think of their history as linear.”
Through Russia’s yearly celebration of defeating the Nazis in World War II on May 9, Russians continue to “share a sacred kinship,” according to Carleton.
On that day, Carleton said, Russians from all generations show “pride in themselves,” exemplified through “the spirit of those marching” and “holding the photographs of those who served.”
“Russian identity can be forged from the ultimate triumph in war,” he added.
This sacred kinship, per Carleton, “transcends politics and class” and “unites them” as “one family, symbolically born from the war and from the blood of their greatest generation.”
This source of Russian pride and unity, Carleton said, is entrenched not only in a fight against invaders but also in a belief that Russia is always on the side of the “just.”
In the eyes of the Russians throughout history, he said “it’s not just Western aggression, but it’s rather a Western overall colonial genocidal drive against the world.”
Carleton said during the event that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants the Russian people to believe that Nazism did not disappear, but transformed into imperialism exhibited by the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
“And now, according to President Putin’s speech on the day of invasion in February, the same Nazi threat has taken seed in Ukraine,” he said.
“He has come to believe in his own history and his own propaganda,” Carleton added.

A new Harvard Institute of Politics poll found that 63 percent of young Americans support stricter gun laws, according to early results released Tuesday.
The results, taken from the IOP’s biannual poll of Americans aged 18 to 29, showed a majority support stricter gun control even across different demographics, including gender, race, and education status. The full results of the poll, conducted by the IOP’s Public Opinion Project and written by Harvard undergraduates, will be released in April.
The IOP released its preliminary findings following a shooting at a Nashville elementary school Monday that left three children and three adults dead. IOP Polling Director John Della Volpe said in an interview that the release’s timing was intended to accompany “renewed conversations about gun violence” in the wake of the shooting.
The majority of respondents to the IOP’s Youth Poll have supported stricter gun control laws since 2018, when 64 percent of young Americans said they favored additional restrictions.
This marked a major spike from 2013 — the previous time the poll asked about gun control — which showed that 49 percent of young Americans supported stricter laws around gun control.
Ethan L. Jasny ’25, student chair of the Harvard Public Opinion Project, said he believes the major shift between 2013 and 2018 was caused by the gun control movement — which included the founding of national advocacy group March for Our Lives — following the Parkland, Florida, school shooting in 2018.
“Those protests after Parkland, March for Our Lives, was really a galvanizing movement for our generation that led to higher turnout in 2018, 2020,” Jasny said. “But the point is that is possibly one of the moments when awareness about gun issues was highest, so the fact that those numbers are tracking from then, when we asked these questions in the last couple of weeks before the Nashville shooting, just shows how salient this continues to be.”
David M. Hogg ’23, a Parkland survivor and founder of March for Lives, said the poll shows consistent support among young Americans for stricter gun laws.
“The poll shows that clearly we’re at a tipping point in this country with our generation on this issue, that Gen Z is making the difference on gun violence prevention,” Hogg said. “Our opinions are not going up and down at the news cycle because this is a daily reality for us, during our lives, in our schools and our communities.”
“Not only are we voting at the highest rates in American history of any generation, at our age, we’re voting clearly in one direction,” Hogg said.
The poll also found 47 percent of young Americans felt “down, depressed, or hopeless” for at least several days in the two weeks prior. These respondents were more likely to report being “afraid, as if something awful is about to happen,” and “worried about a potential mass shooting when in a public space.”
“What is safe to say is that given the frequency of mass shootings, even when they aren’t directly in the headlines, again, mass shootings are certainly something that’s contributing to the mental health crisis for young Americans,” Jasny said.
“This policy issue is, I think, closely related to the broader mental health issue we see facing our generation,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of Harvard College students kicked off a nationwide movement advocating for social prescribing — a practice allowing physicians to prescribe non-medical interventions — in a webinar Monday.
The student group, known as the Harvard Undergraduate Initiative Students for Social Prescribing, formally launched the national movement — the United States Social Prescribing Student Movement — in conjunction with Social Prescribing USA and the Harvard Global Health Institute.
The undergraduate group was founded last March and is the first chapter of the new nationwide movement. The chapter has 12 members working to design social prescribing pilot projects, develop best practices around social prescribing, and advise activists and policymakers.
Daniel Morse, the founding director of Social Prescribing USA, spoke at the launch webinar about why social prescribing is necessary, citing the prevalence of depression, obesity, and addiction in the United States.
“America faces a bunch of silent crises,” Morse said. “We aren’t solving these effectively with just pills and procedures alone. We need something else.”
Morse pointed to a 2019 review published by the World Health Organization, which found through an examination of more than 3,000 studies that engaging in the arts can improve physical and mental health. He also referenced a 2020 study by Harvard’s School of Public Health showing an association between volunteering and living longer.
Under social prescribing, physicians refer patients to local organizations for volunteering, engagement in the arts, and other activities, in addition to prescribing medical treatments.
“These flourishing activities can be essential drivers of wellness,” Morse said.
Morse added that traditionally, health care has not addressed the importance of social activities in promoting health.
“A new chapter in our understanding of health is emerging, and it starts with a simple idea and a simple question,” Morse said. “That question is, ‘What if doctors prescribe more than just pills? What if they prescribe those very activities that bolster health — access to arts, nature, volunteering, access to social services like food and housing assistance?’”
In an interview, Madeline Maier ’23, the president and co-founder of the undergraduate social prescribing organization, said that her internship at the National Academy for Social Prescribing in the United Kingdom was the inspiration behind launching the Harvard group.
“We can bring the principles that they have there to us in the U.S., and those principles are that not everything just boils down to your biological health,” Maier said. “Everything contributes to your overall well-being, your stress, your eating, your financial situation, your overall environment.”
Rachel Chen ’23, another co-founder of the group, said social prescribing inspires her because it represents more than “a systematic health care change.”
“This is a cultural revolution,” Chen said. “This is a cultural shift toward understanding patients as people, having a better and more compassionate holistic care system, and empowering local communities to take care of each other.”
“It’s people knowing that they can turn to each other for support, rather than going just to a doctor for a pill,” she added.

The Project on Psychedelics Law and Regulation at Harvard Law School’s Petrie-Flom Center hosted a virtual panel on psychedelics in Europe, Australia, and North America on Monday.
Co-hosted with the RAND Drug Policy Research Center, the event — titled “Psychedelics in the Global North” — is the first of a three-part series that will later explore psychedelics in the Global South and the role of psychedelics in Indigenous groups. The conversation featured four experts from the regions and was moderated by American researcher Beau Kilmer, a senior policy researcher at RAND Corporation.
Speaking from the Australian perspective, Wayne Hall — emeritus professor of Health and Behavioral Sciences at the University of Queensland — said the Australian government was supportive of clinical trials for MDMA — commonly known as ecstasy — and psilocybin, the active ingredient in psychedelic mushrooms, for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, respectively.
“In the past, I’ve advocated for government funding for clinical trials on these drugs,” Hall said. “And the Australian government several years ago, in fact, set aside 15 million Australian dollars for the conduct of these clinical trials.”
Pamela Kryskow — the medical lead of mental health nonprofit Roots To Thrive, which offers psychedelic-assisted therapy — discussed developments in the Canadian psychedelics space.
“There’s a strong recognition — especially in British Columbia and I think across Canada — that drug use is really a healthcare issue and a healthcare treatment, and not a criminal or a policing issue,” Kryskow said.
Kryskow also noted the significance of Canada’s federal healthcare system, which dictates that legal decisions made by the federal government are also binding at the province level. She characterized developments in medicinal psychedelics as a largely centralized, national issue.
In contrast to the liberal approaches taken by Australia and Canada, David J. Nutt, director of the Neuropsychopharmacology Unit in the Division of Brain Science at Imperial College London, said he is disappointed by the United Kingdom’s more cautious approach.
“We actually know these drugs do make people’s brains different in a positive way. But has that made any difference in the U.K.?” Nutt asked. “The British government is almost actively avoiding confronting the need to do this research.”
Nutt highlighted recent studies supporting psilocybin’s ability to reduce the effects of depression. In one study, the mean depression scores of patients dropped so dramatically following a single dose of psilocybin that it amounted to what Nutt called “the most powerful single dose treatment of resistant depression there has ever been.”
Margriet van Laar, head of the Drug Monitoring and Policy department at the Trimbos Institute — a Dutch mental health research organization — pointed out increased positive media attention regarding psychedelic drug research.
Highlighting a series of developments in the Netherlands, van Laar drew attention to the legalization of ketamine as a treatment for depression and the creation of a state commission to examine the plausibility of legalizing MDMA for medicinal use.
“These are exciting times in the Netherlands in this field,” said van Laar.
Kryskow concluded by discussing the importance of moving quickly in psychedelic research and policymaking.
“We have to remember patients have access to this right now. Online, everywhere. And so us moving too slow is not serving the patients at all,” Kryskow said. “This is not a molecule in the lab. They have access to this and we have a public duty to get the data out there and show up and lead this.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jai K. Khurana ’24 was waiting at the Charles/MGH subway station in Boston when he received an email notifying him that he had been selected to join Harvard College’s chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, the nation’s oldest academic honor society.
“I was actually trapped in Boston. I was coming back from MGH, and the Red Line was down. So I was waiting for the Red Line — and I just saw it on my phone,” said Khurana, a History and Science concentrator in Winthrop House.
Khurana joins 23 other Harvard juniors who learned Monday afternoon that they were the first members of their class tapped for the Alpha Iota chapter of Phi Beta Kappa.
No more than 10 percent of each graduating class are elected to Phi Beta Kappa, with an additional 48 students selected in the fall of their senior year and an additional 96 before commencement. The Senior 48 for the Class of 2023 were elected last November.
Students must demonstrate academic performance that shows “both depth of study and breadth of intellectual interest” to be admitted into the society, according to the College’s chapter website.
This year’s students hail from all houses except Cabot House and study disciplines across all three academic divisions. Winthrop House produced the most ‘Junior 24’ inductees, with five.
Several of the inductees said they were excited for the social connections Phi Beta Kappa offers.
Sarrah Bushara ’22-’24, a Philosophy concentrator in Winthrop House who took a four-year hiatus after high school to pursue classical music before beginning at Harvard, said she looks forward to having “an excuse to make new friends here.”
“I think it’ll be nice just because I am kind of a non-traditional student,” Bushara said. “My main social ties to the school are just going into office hours and talking about schoolwork.”
Trey Sullivan ’24, a Winthrop House resident studying History and Literature, said he is excited to meet students from other disciplines.
“One of my favorite things about being at Harvard in general, and about being in different spaces at Harvard, is how different, but passionate, people are about different things,” Sullivan said.
“This seems like just another space where there are people from the humanities like me, but also the social sciences and the natural sciences, who are all super passionate and engaged scholars,” he added.
Kaylie S. Hausknecht ’23-’24, an Astrophysics and Physics joint concentrator in Pforzheimer House, said that she hopes to meet more people in her class through PBK because she took a gap year.
“I’m not sure if I’ll know most of them, so I’m excited to meet them,” she said.
Some of the inductees said the recognition was a testament to their dedication to making a positive scholarly impact on the world.
“I really truly believe that each of our roles is to make the world a better place than we left it,” said Simar S. Bajaj ’24, a double concentrator in Chemistry and History and Science, who lives in Dunster House.
“And to that end, I think Phi Beta Kappa and being inducted is a recognition of that social role and the need to really have a larger social role rather than just using your gifts for self-aggrandizement,” he added.
William A. Nickols ’24, a Kirkland House resident pursuing a joint concentration in Statistics and Chemical and Physical Biology, said receiving the honor was “a really nice recognition of work along the path of exploring issues and understanding how we are in a position to improve the world.”
The award encourages him “going deep into particular subjects and really exploring the long histories of thought and developments that people have made,” Nickols said. “It means a lot to me that I’m being recognized for the thought that I’ve been exposed to here and my ability to work with those thoughts.”
The inductees said that while the award served as validation for their hard work, their academic careers were not influenced by the award.
“It naturally appeals to me, pursuing a wide variety of fields,” said Alexander J. Chen ’24, a Neuroscience and Chemistry concentrator in Quincy House.
“I’m probably more glad that I pursued these pursuits for the sake of them, rather than for any particular honor. But I’m — of course — happy that they’ve been recognized,” he added.
Hausknecht said that the award does not impact how she sees her academic interests.
“It’s exciting to get the award,” she said. “I love learning. I love physics, which is what I study. I always will, with or without this award.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio discussed the impacts of artificial intelligence on cities at a lecture Tuesday hosted by the Harvard Kennedy School’s Program on Science, Technology, and Society.
The talk — titled “AI for Cities or Cities for AI: Who Should Decide?” — also featured a panel consisting of Mike B. Firestone ’05, City of Boston Chief of Policy and Strategic Planning; Sharad Goel, professor at the Kennedy School; Antoine Picon, professor at the Graduate School of Design; and Ya-Wen Lei, professor of Sociology.
The discussion, part of STS’s “Science & Democracy” lecture series, was moderated by Sheila S. Jasanoff ’64, director of the STS program, and was co-sponsored by the Harvard University Center for the Environment and the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs.
To frame his discussion, de Blasio criticized the lack of discourse surrounding the pitfalls of AI, challenging the “almost-classic American sense” that technological development is “inherently good.”
“The question I always ask is: are the problems that AI will solve greater than the problems that it will create? It’s not a novel thought, but it is absent — too absent — in so much of our public discourse,” he said.
To illustrate his point, de Blasio listed potential dangers of the deployment of AI systems, including misinformation through deepfakes, adverse educational consequences of ChatGPT, and the dangers of a “powerful system falling in the wrong hands.”
“I’ve rarely seen anything even slightly as important as this go so undiscussed in the official discourse,” he said, referring to these issues.
De Blasio presented recommendations for government action on these dangers, including implementing licensing regulations, creating a legal liability structure, introducing product safety requirements, and holding congressional hearings on a regular basis to “shine a light.”
Above all, though, society must address the false “feeling of inevitability” surrounding the issue of AI, per de Blasio.
“These potential negative outcomes are not inevitable. They’re simply not inevitable,” he said.
“They are very advanced in my view, and troubling, but not inevitable. And when we think they’re inevitable, we are losing as the human race, and when we think they are not inevitable, we are self-empowering,” de Blasio added.
During the panel discussion following de Blasio’s speech, Goel, the Kennedy School professor, spoke about the difficulties of accounting for inherent bias in algorithms while also optimizing for efficiency.
He described one of his past projects, an app that helps people obtain transportation to go to court. Goel pointed out the difficulty of both maximizing the number of people helped while ensuring even representation across different neighborhoods.
“This really highlights one of the challenges of this technocracy, where people like myself often will go in, and we’ll design these algorithms without – in the worst of cases — consulting people,” Goel said.
“Even when we do try to consult people, we end up with this vast variance,” he added.
In an interview after the event, Firestone, the Boston city administrator, reaffirmed the need for municipal governments to regulate emerging technologies.
“The city needs to take a really people-centered approach to this new technology. Boston is going to be a place where great innovation happens, but our job here is to look out for our residents,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Center for Jewish Studies hosted Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Tony Kushner for a conversation with Harvard professor Stephen J. Greenblatt Tuesday evening.
More than 150 people crowded into Sanders Theatre for the talk, titled “An Evening with Tony Kushner,” which was funded by the Alan and Elisabeth Doft Lecture and Publication Fund.
Critically acclaimed for his play, “Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes,” Kushner spoke about the theme of Jewish identity in his work and the ability of art to push boundaries.
During the talk, Kushner said he feels “deeply indebted to Jewish teaching” for informing his work and its lessons, citing “Jewish notions of fairness and decency and responsibility.”
“I love Jewish dialectics, I love what I see as an ethical mandate to not be a fundamentalist but to be a reader of text and an interpreter of text,” Kushner said.
Greenblatt, also a Pulitzer Prize honoree, asked how Kushner knows when he is finished with his writing process.
Kushner stressed the importance of rewriting, especially for plays, which he said are “never finished.”
“Every time I get involved in any production with the second part of Angels, I do rewrites,” Kushner said, a lesson he said he learned from Shakespeare.
“That was I think his business model,” said Greenblatt, a literary historian who is an expert on Shakespeare. “In fact, he figured out that it was better to leave it open.”
Greenblatt also asked Kushner for his opinions on Shakespeare’s play, “The Merchant of Venice,” which some scholars contend is anti-Semitic for its portrayal of antagonist Shylock.
“Does it make you squirm in your seat? Do you think it should be banned?” Greenblatt asked.
Kushner replied that he thinks “no art should be banned,” even art that may make people feel unsafe.
“I think it’s so rare that you encounter a work of art that has enough force to actually make you feel unsafe, but in the rare moments when you do that, you should treasure it at that point,” Kushner said. “That’s the whole point of art.”
Audience members asked Kushner questions during the second half of the event.
In response to a question on his relationship with Israel, Kushner said he believes the existence of a Jewish state is important, even as he hopes for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s removal from office.
“I of course absolutely want Israel to continue to exist. I want Israel to change,” he said.
“I have absolutely no idea what's gonna happen next,” he added. “But I feel a certain amount of optimism.”
Kushner said complexity is key to his creative process in response to a question from Crimson Magazine editor Sazi T. Bongwe ’26.
“If I’m not confused by it, I shouldn’t write a play about it,” he said.
Kushner said his “only real job” as an artist is to “try and figure out how to tell the truth.”
Still, Kushner said he believes art and activism are distinct.
“I’m never feeling that I have to write a play that will create a revolution,” he said. “I think the power of art is an indirect power, and if you can make peace with that, I think you’re going to access something quite extraordinary.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You better “believe it.”
The 2023 Harvard women’s basketball team (20-12, 9-5 Ivy League) made history this past weekend by playing in the Great Eight of the NCAA Women’s National Invitation Tournament (WNIT) for the first time in program history. The Crimson traveled to the Big Apple to meet familiar Ivy adversary Columbia for the fourth time this season, though Harvard wasn’t able to fend off the Lions, losing in a close six-point game by the score of 77-71.
The Crimson first made its mark in the history books when it defeated the University of Massachusetts in a two-point matchup in Amherst, Mass., giving it a ticket to the third round of the WNIT for the first time ever. Harvard kept the ball rolling in a win over the University of Rhode Island at Lavietes Pavilion, beating the Rams 74-63 in a back-and-forth battle. Back in November, Harvard faced Rhode Island in its second game of the season, emerging with an 88-74 triumph.
This win also made head coach Carrie Moore the winningest first-year head coach for the Crimson with 20 victories. Coach Moore was a new addition to Harvard women’s basketball after the retirement of long-time head coach for Harvard Kathy Delaney-Smith. Moore has led Harvard to its most successful season despite it being her first year as coach, let alone the string of injuries the team endured this season.
“I think that says a lot about our team as a unit,” said senior captain and guard McKenzie Forbes. “Coach Moore has always said, ‘all we got is all we need’ — we had to apply that a lot this year, whether that's being out for injury, not having practice players, or whatever the case may be — we've always felt like all we have is all we need, right here in this program with us.”
This season, Harvard was forced to play several games in the late Fall through January with only seven to eight dressed players, putting an extensive amount of pressure on active players. Despite the odds, these players, such as first-year Katie Krupa and star sophomore guard Harmoni Turner, did not disappoint.
“We're super gritty. We just work hard,” Forbes commented. “We find ways to get the job done, no matter who we're up against or who we have suited up on our end.”
After the Crimson prevailed over the Rams, Harvard awaited its quarterfinal lot based on the Columbia-Syracuse game, from which the Lions came out on top, likewise sending them to the Great Eight. This Columbia team has completely reinvented itself, rebuilding into a strong program after winning only nine combined games between the 2016 and 2018 seasons.
In the first game Harvard played against Columbia in mid-January, the Lions trounced the Crimson 82-56. However, Harvard did not let the New York school have it so easy the second time around, falling to the Lions in a five-point match at home on February 17.
Columbia poured in over 150 points between the two games, more than 30 of which were off second-chance buckets. The Crimson also committed 44 personal fouls.
The stats don’t tell the full story, though.
“The first time we played them, we lost one of our starters to injury, and then another one of our players was hurt,” junior guard Lola Mullaney said. “It was kind of a weird game.”
The second time around, the Crimson held on until late. They put together a fourth-quarter rally, outsourcing the Lions 33-24 in the final frame, but ultimately fell 75-70.
Columbia has put together two strong seasons, boasting a 12-2 conference record both this year and last. The team also made the final of the 2022 Ivy Madness Tournament, losing to Princeton 77-59, which went on to win the tournament. Harvard defeated Columbia 72-65 in an overtime thriller in the 2023 Ivy Madness Tournament on March 10 before losing to Princeton.
“We know each other very well, on both sides — everyone is very aware of players' tendencies and things like that,” said Forbes when asked about the competition between Harvard and Columbia. “I think it just comes down to grit, toughness, and who can execute down the stretch. I don't think it's anything about strategy. It's kind of a game of chess, but I think it just comes down to the execution when it matters most.”
For the Crimson, locking in on defense just might be the key to turning things around in its next season.
“We know each other really well on the court,” Forbes said. “I think that shows up in our offense, which is why we've been able to put up some of the points in this postseason tournament run.”
“I think defensively, we have to be a bit better,” the senior captain continued. “I think we were pretty solid against Rhode Island in the second half. But I think [we need to] start games with more stops to be able to contain the other team for 40 minutes.”
Though Harvard was unable to clinch a semifinal pass to the WNIT tournament, this season will go down in history, all while a new coach stood at the helm. With Forbes and senior guard and captain Maggie McCarthy departing after the season, up-and-coming first-years and sophomores, equipped with strong postseason experience, will be critical to Harvard’s campaign to return to the top of the Ivy League and to the NCAA Tournament
“If you have this freshman group that came in this year and we made a deep run — that's the standard for them. And they're gonna know nothing different,” Forbes said. “So by the time that they’re seniors, the class below them and below that will have that standard set – that's important.”
“You're building a winning culture. I'm super grateful to be a part of the group that's kind of set that tone for the years to come,” the captain continued. “As far as building winning programs goes, to sit in that culture and that standard of play: we play deep into March, we play in the postseason, and we win games.

Even as the fun of Housing Day has settled down since before spring break, our love and admiration for the Housing Day videos has stayed strong. This year’s songs were especially catchy and the bar was raised towering-ly high, but some houses still excelled above the rest with their musical abilities. Here’s Flyby’s definitive list of rankings for this year’s Housing Day videos.
Currier Tier: The Best of the Best
1. Currier: Currier vs. the World
This one probably comes with no surprise—we know that this song is still stuck in your head. Currier had it all: the video production, the editing (flyby shoutout included), the audio quality. This video singlehandedly rebranded the entire Quad (ignited the Quad Renaissance, if you will). They were right when they said “this is what you want.”
Gold Tier
2. Quincy: #PenguinsForever
Quincy’s video was unique in its ability to appeal to bring many different types of vibes at the same time. It began with on-screen lyrics overlaying sunlit videos of Quincy House residents, moving into a more hype, rap-reminiscent style of videography with quick cuts of footage taken mostly indoors—and we ate up every second of it. We know that we’re going to have “Q-U-I-N-C-Y, we the best, you know why,” on repeat in our heads for the next two to three business days at the minimum.
3. Pfoho: We Are Pfoho
This video was incredibly genius and the theme was executed well throughout the entire video, which was very much appreciated. The lyrics went hard, and the Pfohomies did not hold back: “Your man in the river and he flockin’ to the Quad for me”—yeah, they did that. The pfriends theme song already had us drawn in, and the contrast that it created with the rest of the video just made it all the more wonderful. Very well done.
4. Cabot: Caborilla
Cabot’s video quality was honestly one of the best we saw. Actually, the chorus of this video is still stuck in our heads. There was not one part that we felt compelled to skip because the Cabotians were able to find so many different ways to hype up their house, especially when it came to highlighting their spacious singles! C-A-B-O-T till the end!
Silver Tier
5. Mather: Mather Forever
The list of songs that Mather chose was EXQUISITE. Such a good selection, especially with the vibe of the house and people showcased in each scene. The visual choices and faculty integration was adorable; shout out to the dhall staff! Where Mather fell short, we’re afraid, is that their shining points about the house were a little redundant. Yes, the towers are high, yes, it looks like concrete. It’s okay though — the gorilla cheerleader at the end made up for it.
6. Winthrop: ThropGun Riverick
The thumbnail and title of this video definitely made it one of the most creative releases this season, especially considering the hold that Top Gun had on all of us. (We have to admit: the sunglasses were definitely the move.) The shots in this video were not as clean-cut and pristine as some of the others we have seen, but we nonetheless adored the addition of the puppy and the kiddo. It was still quite catchy, too.
7. Dunster: Dunster House
Dunster’s take was very unique compared to the others, taking the musical approach instead of the typical rapping approach. The big dance scene, the lyrics, the vibes — so Dunster. We couldn’t imagine it any other way. The only thing we would have liked to see was a little more genre variation — we aren’t all theater kids, and you’ve got to appeal to all types of audiences!
Bronze Tier
8. Kirkland: “Kirk It”; “Boars In, Boars Out”; and “Kirky Crooks”
Okay, we have to confess, Act I is quite literally the love of our lives and will be living rent-free in our heads for an entirely reasonable amount of time (until next year, maybe?). Still, Act II kind of fell flat, with lyrics that seemed to focus only on Kirkland’s proximity to the Yard. We found Act III a little bit better, though, and will be cackling at the Mather disses the next time we walk past either Kirk or the Concrete Jungle.
9. Eliot: domus, usa
Eliot’s video was sometimes a true bop but switched vibes too many times to let our two brain cells rest in peace. The House staff in the video were adorbs, though, and we will definitely be showing our non-Harvard friends “Sippin’ on that Stein Wine” next time we need to convince them that we go to a “prestigious institution.”
10. Leverett: 106 & Lev
Leverett had some solid song choices, resonating with our childhoods in the best way possible. We felt that it was a tad lacking in the execution of its retro concept, but the 106 & Lev emcees went so hard, we just had to buy in. The special guest was also amazing!
Honorable Mentions
11. Adams: Doing the Most
The Adams House peeps tried so hard and the “surveillance footage” concept was kinda cute, but the scenes included in Adams’ video weren’t enough to convince us that Adams is, indeed, doing the most. We still cracked a few laughs at the House residents showing us their wacky sides — including their famous Adams boxers.
12. Lowell: Bells and Bars
Lowell’s opening was beautiful, but the rest of the video was not captivating enough to have us playing it on repeat. The energy we wanted was just not there, and it seemed like the video started with one concept and then pivoted to something entirely different, making our viewing experience not as immersive as we would’ve liked, though still a vibe. But at least we’ll remember the belltower?
Overall, every Housing Day video did a fabulous job of showcasing the vibrant community and amazing perks found in each and every House. We learned so much about each House just by watching them, and at least a few minutes of each one will be finding their way onto our playlists. We can’t wait for next year’s!
