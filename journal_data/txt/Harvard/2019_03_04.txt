After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the 1971 film adaptation of the musical “Fiddler on the Roof,” a young Russian revolutionary named Perchik clumsily proposes marriage to the bright, witty Hodel by asking her “a political question…the question of marriage!” When Hodel inquires whether marriage is really a political question, Perchik responds pithily, “Everything’s political!”
The film was released during the height of a radical second-wave feminist movement that seemed to largely agree with Perchik, championing the slogan “the personal is the political.” Personal issues of sex, sexual expression, marriage, child-rearing, and more were intentionally subjugated to the harsh limelight of political analysis and activism. In the late 1970s, an equally vocal counter-movement gave rise to a newly politically-conscious Christian right that also sought legal codifications of family and religious values.
A half century later, to say that “everything’s political” is a massive understatement. Politics has become unmoored from actual policy, philosophy, or theories of governance. If we cared about any of those things, I doubt we would sob hysterically from despair or happiness at election outcomes or wish such terrible curses like death and doxxing upon high school students. We wouldn’t be so distrustful of “fake news” and the obvious biases of MSNBC and Fox News if actual policy and facts were at the core of our politics. We wouldn’t be so personally hurt and offended by different political opinions if we didn’t think those opinions were fundamental violations of our very humanity.
The fervor, emotion, zeal, and devotion that now characterize the political scene (on all sides, truly) are typical characteristics of another scene entirely. What politics often looks like now is nothing other than a religion, and not a good one.
Religions often have dogmas, clergy, sacred texts and symbols, and holy figures. They are insular, rejecting proclaimers of anathema and heresies, with rituals and worship. Religion is often scorned as mindless heeding of arcane moral judgments from some invisible deity, the practice of the narrow-minded and insipid.
But the reality is that every single one of us is religious. Why? The heart of religion is worship, and the heart of worship is sacrifice, and we all make sacrifices to something.
Enter the Twilight Zone with me for a moment and try to examine our political scene in this light. For example, we do not treat the double entendre pink hats of the Women’s March and red Make America Great Again hats as mere attire, but as icons, a kind of vestment of our sect. Take, for instance, the Covington Catholic debacle, in which high school students wearing MAGA hats at the March for Life were falsely accused of taunting a Native American man. Forget the actual facts of the matter: the iconography of a particular red hat rules the day.
The media preach and interpret as priests, self-styled gatekeepers of truth telling us what dogma we ought to live by. The axioms of diversity, equality, and tolerance, or security, primacy, and power are truly dogmatic by telling us what acceptable beliefs and behaviors are acceptable. Deviate, and a clerical communion of politicians and “journalists” with Twitter profiles will offer a virtue signal in penitence for the fashionable identity label you’ve managed to offend, and call for you, a heretic, to delete your account and be excommunicated. The media clergy also call for the faithful to take to the streets for the ritual sacrifice of protests with sacred slogans, adorned with holy icons. Dutifully, the faithful participate in the sacrament.
Dogma lives loudly within us. We may fancy ourselves missionaries seeking to convert the wrong-headed from their backward ways with our always-eloquent and peaceable catechesis in Internet comment sections, but often we are crusaders (resisters, perhaps) on a divinely-sanctioned mission to defeat demons who dissent.
If there is one bright spot in this haunting and dark parallel of misguided religion, it is that the most ardent and vocal zealot extremists are frequently tiny minorities. We often claim that a few bad apples are not reflective of the whole bushel, and indeed, I’ve met very few people who have truly made politics something of a self-destructive religion. Most people I know do care about democracy and governance and take an active but non-consuming interest in politics. Unfortunately, it is difficult to tune out the extremists.
In the end of “Fiddler on the Roof,” Perchik’s religious zeal for politics couldn’t save him. It condemned him and his wife to live out a prison term in remote Siberia. I don’t think any of us expect politics to save us individually. But Perchik’s hero, Karl Marx, did not write that religion was the opiate of one man; he wrote that it was the opiate of the masses. Our collective political rituals may reveal far more about our beliefs than we’d like to think.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One of the most confusing SAT questions I had to answer came before the test proctor even started the clock. After bubbling in my entire home address letter for letter on the Scantron, I was already annoyed. But then, I reached the demographic question about race. There it was, next to an innocent looking bubble, the line of text that irks me and most Middle Eastern-Americans alike: “White (including Middle Eastern origin).”
As someone who is half European and half Syrian, I can assure you that white and Middle Eastern are two very distinct races, holding different levels of esteem within American society, and should thus be listed as two separate options on all demographic surveys, including Harvard’s options for racial identification.
Americans hailing from the Middle East and North Africa are forced to identify as white in demographic surveys far beyond standardized testing. The United States Census makes no distinction between those of white and Middle Eastern or North African descent. The 2020 Census will be no different, as the U.S. Census Bureau considered adding an option to separate the Middle East and North African region, also referred to as the MENA region, but decided against it. The Common Application has recently added a new option allowing those of Native American descent to select their tribal affiliation, which is commendable, yet it continues to grossly generalize all students from the MENA region as white. Finally, Harvard itself falls into the trap of categorizing Middle Eastern students as white, as this categorization even appears on student’s my.harvard.
Beyond a cry to be recognized as a people, the case for including a MENA category on demographic surveys includes the very tangible effects it would have on the Middle Eastern and North African-American populations in the United States. It is impossible to discern if there are achievement gaps, wage gaps, or even gaps in voter turnout between Middle Eastern and North African-Americans and other racial groups in the United States because data cannot be stratified to isolate this significant portion of the population. In fact, I cannot even relay with certainty what percent of the United States population is descended from the MENA region, due to the incomplete structure of the census question. Without a nationwide standard that separates “white” from “Middle Eastern and North African,” it is nearly impossible to determine how this racial group is faring in America, much less remedy any inequity that might be revealed through adequate data. And on the hot topic of race-conscious admissions to universities such as Harvard, a diverse body of students cannot be guaranteed to include individuals from the MENA region if admissions counselors cannot even determine who identifies as of Middle Eastern or North African descent.
In post-Patriot Act America, the Middle Eastern population in this country is far from invisible. At a time when many Middle Eastern Americans may be trying to conceal their roots as to avoid any semblance of ties to radical Islam, there is perhaps a greater need to collect data that makes sure that this group is not being discriminated against in other ways. The Middle Eastern-American population is a target of discrimination in the post-9/11 era, and we need data that ensures that this population is voting, graduating high school, and securing jobs at a rate that is on par with the actual “white” America. The White House administration that is quick to point out the “otherness” of the MENA region with a proposed travel ban seems to only identify Middle Eastern populations as white for survey purposes, when proper identification would work to this population’s advantage.
While we will have to wait until the 2030 Census or later to see a separate category for the MENA region, Harvard can enact changes as soon as next year. Harvard should allow enrolled students to identify specifically as of “Middle Eastern or North African descent” on my.harvard and should add a more accurate racial demographics question to its application so that prospective students can correctly identify their race despite the Common Application’s failure to distinguish white and Middle Eastern. In addition to providing greater accuracy to Harvard’s admissions and student body statistics, this change would hopefully encourage other organizations, and ultimately the U.S. Government, to grant those of Middle Eastern and North African descent their own racial category on demographic surveys.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, students awoke to find graffiti plastered on walls across Winthrop House, calling for Winthrop House Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr. to step down from his position. This protest is just one of the many ways in which students have responded to Sullivan’s decision to represent former film producer Harvey Weinstein, who faces allegations of sexual misconduct. Though we do not consider illegal means the most effective way to communicate such a message, we have enormous respect for the sexual assault survivors and other students who feel silenced by what they perceive to be Harvard’s unsatisfactory response to Sullivan’s defense of Weinstein and Economics Professor Roland G. Fryer, Jr.
We believe it is important to note that this act of vandalism was not the first resort for students unsettled by Sullivan’s actions and the University’s response. In the last few weeks, students have published op-eds, written open letters, and staged protests calling for Sullivan to resign from his position as faculty dean and for the administration to take more tangible forms of action addressing their concerns. That said, we do not condone illegal activity or the defacing of University property to voice these concerns.
To its credit, Harvard has held public forums about the controversy and has even issued a “climate review” to gauge the opinions of Winthrop House residents on the matter. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana’s announcement of the review has demonstrated that the University administration is willing to listen to those who are protesting, but only to a certain extent. The review only has the scope to make official the frustration that Winthrop residents — and the larger student body — have already made loud and clear, and it could pull resources and time away from implementing any measures that could actually address the situation.
Harvard’s use of processes like climate surveys and public forums — though they provide a space for students to express their dissatisfaction with Sullivan’s decision — does not in itself contribute toward any tangible action on the part of the University. It is precisely in response to this inaction that students have taken to public, anonymous forms of protest. At issue in this context is the clear differential of power between students and the administration. The inefficacy of traditional forms of dissent, such as the Association of Black Harvard Women’s open letter to Sullivan, is evidence of the severity of this gap in power. Students felt that they were not being heard, and the act of vandalism was a radical demand for Harvard to listen.
That said, illegal means of protest carry drawbacks. They violate the spirit of civil discourse that is most conducive to productive discussion. Vandalism very rarely adds to respectful and meaningful discussion. For these reasons, while we are sympathetic to those who feel unheard in the aftermath of Sullivan’s actions, civil discourse must be the standard to which we hold ourselves.
To further a sense of constructive dialogue going forward, we urge Harvard administrators to be mindful of the consequences of their decisions regarding Sullivan’s deanship, and to acknowledge that some students have found their response thus far to be insufficient. For the sake of maintaining a safe and productive campus culture for all, Harvard must do more to make students feel that they have meaningful recourse outside of illegal demonstrations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Parents of the Class of 2020 were unfazed by the snowfall that swept the northeast this past weekend as they arrived on Harvard’s campus to participate in Junior Family Weekend — an annual event that welcomes family members of the junior class to spend time on campus.
Scheduled programming for the weekend offered junior class parents a window into what life at Harvard is like for their children. The events, which began Friday morning and concluded Saturday midday, included information sessions, tours of Harvard’s museums and libraries, faculty presentations, and House events.
Sarita Damaraju ’20 said she appreciated the opportunity the weekend provided to share activities she is involved in on campus with her parents, who came from Texas.
Damaraju, a performer and organizer of Harvard South Asian Association’s Ghungroo show, said her parents attended the show during the weekend.
“Me and my friends have been working on it for awhile so it was nice to have them meet my friends and see the whole production, which I’ve been talking about for so long,” Damaraju said.
Alexa “Raven” Richard ’20, whose parents and sister came to Junior Family Weekend from Georgia, said she and her family enjoyed the Saturday morning faculty presentations. They attended Philosophy Lecturer Cheryl Chen’s presentation “Divine Providence and the Problem of Evil: Is God a Free-Range Parent?”and Government Professor's lecture “Tech Science to Save the World."
While some families adhered to the program, others said they made their own fun, using the weekend to unwind by touring Boston, dining out, or shopping.
“I have some friends who take their parents to classes to take them through their everyday routine, but we approached it as sort of a respite,” said Yu-Mi Kim ’20, whose parents flew in from New York. Kim said she and her parents ate out throughout the weekend.
Many students said they enjoyed Friday evening’s House receptions, which brought together faculty deans, juniors, and their parents within the respective Houses. Some students said the event provided an intimate setting for parents to mingle with their children’s friends and their children’s friends’ parents.
Nicholas E. Stauffer-Mason ’20 said the reception was “definitely a highlight.”
“It was a great opportunity for my parents to meet my other friends’ parents in a way that doesn’t necessarily happen organically otherwise,” he said.
Madeleine R. Snow ’20 said she felt it was important for her parents, who drove from Chappaqua, NY to “meet people who have the greatest impact on” her college experience.
“Also, you know, we miss our families,” she added.
For students whose parents were unable to visit Harvard over the weekend, the Undergraduate Council hosted a three-course lunch on Saturday that coincided with the scheduled Class of 2020 Luncheon in the Houses for juniors and their family members in the House dining halls. Professors from various departments and the dean and associate dean of undergraduate education attended the UC-hosted lunch.
UC President Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 said Junior Family Weekend can be “isolating” for students whose parents were unable to attend. The lunch with faculty, she said, would provide alternative support to these students.
“Having the faculty members there to still help provide them with support and guidance through meaningful conversations is incredibly meaningful,” she said.
Mfundo T. Radebe ’20, who is from South Africa, said his parents were unable to come to campus for Junior Family Weekend due to the distance.
Nonetheless, Radebe said he felt that Family Weekend had an uplifting effect on the ethos of the campus.
“There’s something I really loved about parents weekend because it’s just like — even though my parents weren’t here — Harvard just felt more wholesome and less stressful,” Radebe said.

The Undergraduate Council voted to modify its attendance requirements for representatives at its general meeting Sunday.
UC President Sruthi Palaniappan ’20, Vice President Julia M. Huesa ’20, and Secretary Cade S. Palmer ’20, who is also a former Crimson Sports Chair, proposed legislation that automatically categorizes certain absences from UC meetings as excused. Previously, if representatives missed three UC meetings, they were required to meet with the UC’s executive board for an “attendance review.”
“It’s basically a problem solving session where we touch base,” Huesa said of attendance reviews. “It’s just to understand why you might be missing meetings.”
Under the new system, absences due to conflicts such as academic and medical commitments will automatically be considered excused, and the UC secretary will be allowed to excuse other absences at his or her discretion. Three unexcused absences will lead to an attendance review.
The legislation was prompted by a large number of attendance reviews in the past week that the executive board had to conduct due to absences, according to Palaniappan. Under the new system, most of those absences would be considered as excused.
The UC also accepted an amendment to the legislation that considers absences from rescheduled UC meetings as excused.
The overall legislation passed 24-0-5.
The Council also considered an amendment proposed by Elm Yard Representative Rachel L. Reynolds ’22, which would limit the amount of time that representatives have to comment on their vote after the fact to one minute.
In the parliamentary procedure that the UC follows, representatives can declare their votes “with rights” during roll call vote, which gives them time to explain their votes after voting concludes.
Though most other speeches during the Council’s meetings are timed, representatives are currently allowed unlimited time to talk during a “with rights” speech.
Reynolds, who is responsible for keeping time during the meetings as the Council’s parliamentarian, said she proposed the legislation to make meetings more efficient.
Some representatives said they feel “with rights” speeches are important, especially because UC members are allowed to change their votes on legislation up to a week after the initial vote.
“I think that what's really important about ‘with rights’ speeches is in the cases of when 95 percent of us move one way, that 5 percent has the opportunity to say something that can be drowned out,” said Sung Kwang Oh ’21, a Crimson Multimedia editor.
The amendment initially passed.
Immediately after, however, several representatives gave “with rights” speeches, changing enough votes that the “with rights” proposal ultimately failed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The man who threatened to bomb Harvard and shoot attendees of the University’s 2017 black Commencement ceremony pleaded guilty to charges related to the matter Thursday, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office of Massachusetts.
Nicholas Zuckerman, an Arizona resident, pleaded guilty to two charges of “transmitting in interstate and foreign commerce a threat to injure the person of another.”
Zuckerman commented on a Harvard University Instagram post “on or about” May 13, 2017, calling for “violence and death” at the University’s inaugural black Commencement. The annual event — first held in 2017 — is meant to bring black students across the University together and recognize the challenges that students of color may face at Harvard.
“If the blacks only ceremony happens, then I encourage violence and death at it,” Zuckerman wrote in the post. “I’m thinking two automatics with extendo clips.”
Zuckerman also wrote another threatening comment on a different Harvard Instagram post.
“#bombharvard and end their pro-black agenda,” he wrote.
Several minutes after the post, Zuckerman commented “#bombharvard” on other users’ posts about 11 times over a four-minute period, according to the U.S. Attorney’s office.
The U.S. Attorney’s office said a “concerned citizen” reported the posts to the Harvard University Police Department, who then sent the case to federal authorities. Authorities arrested Zuckerman in June 2018, more than a year after the incident occured, and he first appeared in court for his arraignment on Aug. 8, 2018.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on Zuckerman’s guilty plea.
Prosecutors reached a plea agreement with Zuckerman and his lawyer that calls for the defendant to serve 12-18 months in prison; serve 36 months of supervised release; and pay a fine ranging from $5,500 to $55,000, a mandatory special assessment of $200, and restitution in an amount to be determined at sentencing.
U.S. District Court Judge Indira Talwani scheduled a sentencing hearing for May 23, 2019. Sentencing will determine the exact consequences Zuckerman will face based on sentencing guidelines and the details of the plea agreement. He may face up to five years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a fine of $250,000 depending on Talwani’s ruling.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 100 Harvard affiliates gathered outside of Massachusetts Hall Friday to deliver a petition to University President Lawrence S. Bacow urging Harvard to disclose and divest its holdings in companies tied to the prison industry.
The rally was organized by the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign, a pro-divestment organization founded in 2018, and the Harvard Organization for Prison Education and Advocacy, along with campus groups including Act on a Dream, the Black Students Association, and the Association of Black Harvard Women.
The petition, which has garnered nearly 3500 signatures since its release last month, calls on Bacow and the Harvard Management Company — the University’s investment arm — to withdraw its investments from companies with connections to prisons and disclose these endowment holdings to the public. The petition also demands the University reinvest this money towards programs and organizations that benefit “people directly impacted by the prison-industrial complex” in Boston and Cambridge.
Dharma B. Seda Gonzalez ’22, an organizer with the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign, said the rally was a “culmination of months of work” for the students across Harvard’s schools involved in the movement.
"We're really proud that so many Harvard affiliates agree with us and believe that Harvard should divest,” Gonzalez said in an interview before the rally.
Those at the rally heard speeches from community organizers advocating against mass incarceration and written testimonies from currently incarcerated individuals. Attendees also sang songs like “We Shall Overcome,” and displayed signs with slogans such as “Build People Not Prisons.”
Ralliers braved the cold with enthusiastic chants, punctuating each speech with the words “Back out, Bacow, we want freedom, freedom, all these racist ass jails, we don’t need them, need them.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain referred to previous statements on divestment in response to the rally and petition.
“The University’s position, as it has stated previously, is that it should not use the endowment to achieve political ends, or particular policy ends,” Swain wrote in an emailed statement.
Since the petition was released, the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign has built a coalition of support online and across Harvard’s campus. The campaign’s Facebook page currently has more that 700 followers. Professor of the Practice of Public Philosophy Cornel R. West ’74, a prominent scholar and commentator, signed onto the petition and released a statement calling Harvard’s divestment from the prison industry “a moral imperative.”
For several rally participants, the call for divestment was a personal one. During the rally, organizers encouraged attendees to say aloud the names of loved ones currently or formerly incarcerated.
“We do that as a reminder that it is not just about the dollars,” Harvard Law School student and organizer Anneke F. Dunbar-Gronke said. “There are people and lives.”
Harvard’s nearly $40 billion endowment has long been a point of contention for activists concerned with the University’s investments in fossil fuels and companies with connections to the prison industry. For decades, University presidents have reiterated that the endowment is not a means to enact social change — a talking point fiercely challenged by those pushing for divestment. The University did, however, divest from the tobacco industry in 1990.
When two organizers — Law School student Anna L. Nathanson and Divinity School student Ismail A. Buffins — physically delivered the petition, they said people in Mass. Hall accepted the petition but said they could not meet with Bacow.
“Bacow could do more to engage with us and really use his leadership in this situation and represent what his students want,” Buffins added.
Bacow met with activists from the Prison Divestment Campaign last week, a meeting during which he said he did not respond to “demands” but rather to “reason.”
Swain wrote in an emailed statement that in meetings with advocates, Bacow “has appreciated the opportunity to hear their views and perspective.”
Despite not meeting with Bacow Friday, organizers said they believe the rally demonstrated an increased momentum behind the prison divestment campaign.
"There was a lot of power here today and I can tell this energy is going to keep building,” Natanson said.
Clarification: March 11, 2019
A previous version of the caption of the photo accompanying this article stated that the protesters called on the University to divest from private prisons. To clarify, the protesters were calling on Harvard to divest from the prison industry.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Senator Jeff Flake spoke at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics Friday and criticized the lack of bipartisan collaboration he witnessed during his career in public service.
In a conversation moderated by Kennedy School Assistant Professor of Public Policy Leah W. Rigueur, Flake condemned partisan hostility and the “toxic” state of United States politics.
The crowd at the IOP — which packed the forum auditorium — was silent as Flake recalled the June 2017 Congressional baseball shooting, during which a gunman opened fire on Flake and other Republicans practicing for the annual Congressional Baseball Game. The shooting left five injured, including House of Representatives Majority Whip Steve J. Scalise.
“As bullets were pitching off the gravel in front of me, I just remember thinking at that time: Why us? How could somebody look out at a bunch of middle-aged men playing baseball and see the enemy?” Flake said.
Flake also discussed the fallout of another instance of gun violence: the 2011 attempted assassination of former Representative Gabrielle D. Giffords. Giffords was shot through the head and eventually resigned from her congressional seat to focus on her recovery. During the 2012 State of the Union address, Flake, who was seated next to Giffords, helped her stand to applaud Obama throughout the speech. Flake said that standing alongside Giffords sparked a disturbing amount of backlash.
“I literally got hundreds of emails and texts and calls saying, ‘What are you doing? Are you agreeing with President Obama?'” Flake said. “It was unbelievable that people take any gesture like that as consorting with the enemy.”
Flake has been one of President Donald Trump’s Republican critics in Congress, and has said that he was concerned by Trump’s behavior before his presidential election and while in office.
“I was really bothered before he was a candidate by the birtherism,” Flake said of President Trump. “Then the campaign with the statements about immigrants, and then about John McCain and whatnot — it was too much for me.”
Flake also talked about his time on the Discovery Channel special “Rival Survival,” prompting laughs from the audience. In 2014, Flake and Democratic Senator Martin Heinrich were featured on the show and spent six days stranded on an island in efforts to prove that Republicans and Democrats could work together.
“We wanted to prove that Republicans and Democrats can get along, and so we planned very quietly — didn’t tell one of our colleagues that we were going to maroon ourselves on an island for a week,” Flake said.
Flake said the survival challenge, though humorous, set an example for the potential work that could actually be accomplished in the Senate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences will vote on a proposal to create a new concurrent degree program at its monthly meeting Tuesday.
Under the proposed program, FAS will allow students to simultaneously pursue a bachelor’s degree through the College and a master’s degree through the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. In order to complete the two degrees in four years, students would be allowed to double-count twelve credits — typically equivalent to three courses — towards both degrees. They would then take five GSAS courses in addition to their normal college coursework.
If enacted, the new program would replace the current “Advanced Standing” program, which allows students entering the College with the requisite number of Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate credits to earn a bachelor’s degree in three years or a bachelor’s and a master’s in four. Advanced Standing is currently being phased out.
Unlike Advanced Standing, the new concurrent degree program does not require students to have completed any AP or IB credits. Students in the Class of 2022 and beyond would be eligible to apply.
Faculty members clashed over the concurrent degree program at last month’s meeting.
Comparative Literature Professor Karen L. Thornber, who presented the new program to the Faculty for discussion last month, argued that it would give an “extra boost” to students who might not want to or be able to attend graduate school after earning their undergraduate degree.
But some faculty members contended that the proposed system would overburden students and erode the integrity of a master’s degree.
Computer Science Professor Harry R. Lewis ’68 said at the February meeting that the rationale for requiring students to take five extra classes — meaning they would need to take five courses instead of the typical four for most of their undergraduate careers — for a dual degree would be “too heavy a burden” for even the most qualified students.
“The quality of their work — and again, these are our best students — will go down because they’re going to be splitting their 24 hours five ways instead of four,” said Lewis, who previously served as Dean of the College.
The Faculty will also vote on whether to rename the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies to the “Department of Art, Film, and Visual Studies.” At last month’s meeting, Department Chair Robb Moss argued that the current name has become outdated and no longer reflects the work of its faculty or the courses it offers.
The Faculty Council — FAS’s highest governing body, which advances legislation to the full faculty — voted to endorse both proposals last month. The Council did not hold its regularly scheduled meeting last week.

Winthrop House Faculty Deans Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr. and Stephanie R. Robinson addressed student concerns about “racially offensive” flyers calling for Sullivan’s removal from his post as a faculty dean in a Sunday email to Winthrop affiliates.
A group of students distributed the flyers, which included an illustration of Sullivan and encouraged Winthrop residents to send feedback via an anonymous link, on Feb. 25. Danu A.K. Mudannayake ’20 — who illustrated the flyers — denied that they depicted Sullivan as a caricature or in a racist manner. She said they were intended to call attention to Sullivan’s decision to publicly defend two men accused of sexual misconduct — Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein and Harvard Economics Professor Roland G. Fryer, Jr.
Sullivan — who is also a Harvard Law School professor — has faced student scrutiny since the New York Post first reported on Jan. 23 that he would join Weinstein’s legal team in the film producer’s Manhattan sexual abuse case.
Following the Post story, Sullivan wrote an email to Winthrop residents on Jan. 25 defending his decision to represent Weinstein and writing that defense attorneys have the duty to represent the “unpopular defendant.”
Two days later, Sullivan criticized the University’s handling of three investigations into allegations that Fryer sexually harassed women who worked at his research lab in a RealClearInvestigations article. Sullivan, who is identified as Fryer’s lawyer in the story, called the Harvard probes “deeply flawed and deeply unfair.”
Students have since called on Sullivan to resign as faculty dean in protests, op-eds, and open letters. Most recently, Mudannayake and some members of the anti-sexual assault advocacy organization Our Harvard Can Do Better distributed the flyers in Winthrop last week inviting students to “make your voice heard.” In a separate incident that same day, a vandal spray-painted slogans calling for Sullivan’s removal on the exterior of Winthrop.
Responding to student concerns, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced Feb. 25 that former Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 will lead a “climate review” to collect student feedback about Sullivan’s decision to represent Weinstein.
Sullivan and Robinson wrote that, since house staff discovered the flyers last Monday, students have questioned whether they depict Sullivan in a racially offensive manner. They added that some students said they were particularly concerned that the flyers circulated during Black History Month.
“It should go without saying any racially offensive content undermines our collective commitment to respect and the value we place in everyone in our community, regardless of their race,” they wrote. “From our vantage point, the best way to challenge speech any of you deem unpleasant is to reaffirm our core values, remind ourselves that we are a university with a robust norm of freedom of expression, and speak back to any offending speech.”
Mudannayake, a Crimson Design editor, said that she is disappointed with the Faculty Deans' response and that their email did not address students’ concerns about the wellbeing of house residents who have experienced sexual harassment.
“Honestly, my first response is one of utter disappointment,” Mudannayake said. “I really do think Dean Sullivan and his wife Stephanie have used this as an opportunity to diverge the spotlight off of the survivors in Winthrop House and are failing again to try and relieve the situation for those students and instead have gone on with this allegation that myself and others have a racially-charged motive with wanting him to be removed.”
Asked about Mudannayake’s criticism, Sullivan and Robinson referred back to their email to Winthrop residents and wrote that they did not express an opinion on the flyers.
“[T]he email acknowledges and addresses concerns expressed by some of our students. The Faculty Deans, in contrast, did not express an opinion. We addressed student concerns brought to our attention,” they wrote in an email to The Crimson.
Sullivan and Robinson also wrote in their original Sunday email to Winthrop residents that the Harvard University Police Department continues to investigate the graffiti, which they called “antithetical” to the House’s spirit.
“As always, our doors will remain open for anyone with concerns about House life; however, criminal acts designed to intimidate are antithetical to Winthrop’s spirit and the communal norms that have served us well over the years that we have served in this capacity,” they wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Entering this weekend, No. 9/9 Colgate had never lost a playoff series to Harvard in the ECAC tournament. After a 5-2 domination of the Raiders (23-9-5, 17-4-3 ECAC) on Friday, 2019 looked like the year for the Crimson (12-15-5, 9-9-4) to write a new trend into the history books. Colgate never looked back, though, after an all-Raiders final part of the first, and Harvard’s 2018-19 campaign came to a close.
A fast start to the first from Colgate was bookended by a fast close from the Raiders, a single Crimson goal from freshman forward Dominique Petrie resting between these boundaries of Colgate domination.
Not even four minutes into the start of the contest, freshman forward Eleri MacKay went five-hole on freshman goalie Lindsay Reed, off a pass from her identical twin, freshman forward Delani MacKay. From there play was even for the next few minutes, the back-and-forth broken up only by a spectacular Reed save here and there.
Then, just past the period’s midpoint, Petrie skated the puck down the left side. She swerved to the middle and shot, hitting just inside the right post to put Harvard on the board to tie the game, just as she accomplished Saturday.
A post-clanger from a Raider at 15:15 prevented the Crimson from falling into a second hole, but luck did not continue to favor Harvard. Less than a minute later, Colgate tri-captain Jessie Eldridge — whose 14-game point streak ended Saturday — followed through on a rebound to start a fresh streak.
With fewer than 30 seconds left in the first frame, another Eldridge shot struck true, this time off a down the ice skate-and-shoot. Racing down the right side of the ice, she bypassed the centering pass option to rip the puck past Reed. The period closed out with the Raiders up, 3-1.
In a season that has seen the Crimson rest heavily on phenomenal play from Reed — whose save percentage hovers just above .940, good for top-three in the country — the first period of the final contest of these ECAC quarterfinals exposed some chinks in the armor. In that initial frame, Reed gave up three goals on 15 shots from Colgate.
Reed returned to form for the second period, holding the Raiders to no goals on 12 shots. A near-goal by sophomore forward Becca Gilmore sailed wide, and Harvard could not score on any of its eight other shots. Both sides failed to convert power plays, holding the Crimson to 0-3 and Colgate to 0-2 on scores during the advantage through the first two periods.
The season-deciding final frame opened with a 3-1 Raiders advantage — Harvard playing comeback, and Colgate playing lead-keep. Following a penalty on sophomore forward Brooke Jovanovich, the Raiders transitioned to lead-expand. Just 1:47 into the third, Eleri MacKay hit home to give a second Colgate skater her second goal of the game.
Ten minutes later, taking advantage of another penalty on Jovanovich, Eleri MacKay struck again to give the Raiders the 5-1 lead. The puck, fired from just past the blue line, skirted by Reed and swept around the inside of the net for Eleri MacKay’s first collegiate hat-trick.
Harvard looked to maybe catch a break with 3:32 remaining, as officials stopped the game to take a second view of a try from Petrie. The attempt, though, was ruled no good. Twenty-one seconds later, Petrie avenged that ruling to add a second Crimson goal.
Harvard vied for a third to move closer to forcing overtime, but time expired. For the third time in three consecutive quarterfinal matchups, Colgate had topped the Crimson to head to the ECAC championship weekend.
Although the Harvard season will be coming to an end, the squad has plenty of momentum to build off heading into next year. Partway through January, the Crimson found itself 5-11-2. From that moment, however, Harvard would finish 7-4-2, with all four of its losses coming against top-ten teams.
Along the way, the Crimson rattled off a six-game unbeaten streak and appeared in the Beanpot Championship after a stunning upset against Boston College in the semifinals — a match that saw Reed turn in one of her many 50-plus save performances.
While the team will be losing critical leaders in its four seniors, a strong core of younger players will be returning, including junior forward Kat Hughes (who scored twice in the 5-2 win over Colgate), Gilmore, freshman forward Kristin Della Rovere, Petrie, freshman defender Kyra Willoughby, and Reed, just to name a few of the many pivotal contributors that will be back in uniform playing Harvard hockey.The seniors — co-captain and forward Kate Hallett, co-captain and forward Lexie Laing, forward Bradley Fusco, and defender Kaitlin Tse — will be missed, but they undoubtedly left the program in a better place.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a southern road trip, Harvard (14-11, 7-5 Ivy) started its weekend road trip with a tightly contested overtime loss to the Quakers (20-5, 10-2 Ivy). After the Crimson saw its three game winning streak streak fall, it ended the weekend with a hard fought 61-58 loss to the Tigers (18-9, 10-2 Ivy).
PRINCETON 61, HARVARD 58
Despite two of the best offenses in the Ivy League going head-to-head, Saturday’s game revolved around the defense. Heading into this matchup, both Harvard and Princeton scored over 73 points a game, but were held to only 58 and 61 respectively this time around.
Senior co-captain Madeline Raster recognized how important the Crimson defensive game plan was in attempting to stop the Princeton offense.
“Princeton has some 3 point shooters and a talented guard/forward,” Raster said. “This means we have to know the scout and not allow those players to be comfortable against our defense”.
Harvard’s defensive plan of limiting the Tigers’ three-point shooters proved effective, as Princeton only had four made triples and shot 33 percent from beyond the arc. The Crimson ended up with more field goals and three-pointers than the Tigers.
Free-throw shooting and points off turnovers proved to be the team’s downfall. Princeton had 13 more free throw attempts than Harvard, and outpaced the Crimson with 18 points off of turnovers as opposed to Harvard’s three.
The game started out with early runs by both teams. The Tigers gained the quick momentum with a 12-4 lead before the Crimson answered back with three consecutive baskets. Harvard only had one triple in the first quarter, indicative of three-point struggles in the game, shooting only 23 percent from outside for the contest.
Princeton closed out the quarter with a quick scoring run to head into the second period with an 18-13 lead. The over 1200 fans in Jadwin Gymnasium that night prevented the Crimson from finding its shooting rhythm as comfortably.
“Sometimes playing away can be tough because you’re playing in another team’s house with their fans in their comfort zone” Raster said.
In the second quarter, Harvard’s defense locked down the Tigers’ scoring attack, holding them to only seven points in the period. A triple from senior guard Sydney Skinner closed the quarter and gave the Crimson a 27-25 lead heading into the half.
To start the half, junior forward Jeanne Boehm scored consecutive baskets, and extended Harvard’s lead to four. Boehm was one of the Crimson’s offensive bright spots of the game, scoring 16 points. The quarter continued to be neck-and-neck, ending with Harvard holding a 44-41 lead.
The Crimson maintained its lead in the opening minutes of the final frame, keeping a 5 point margin on Princeton. The Tigers would come back and tie the game four different times in the quarter before scoring the final two baskets of the game to clinch the victory, 61-58.
PENN 75, HARVARD 70
Friday night’s contest came down to the wire, as Penn outlasted Harvard in a tight overtime contest. For the Quakers, their bench performance and advantage in points in the paint gave them the slight edge they needed to prevail against the Crimson.
For much of the game, the teams engaged in a defensive battle that was emblematic of the pace and style that Penn enjoys. Senior co-captain guard Madeline Raster was cognizant that beating the Quakers’ vaunted zone defense was necessary for Harvard to have a chance.
“Penn usually plays a tough zone,” Raster said. “So we need to play our offense with poise, take advantage of the gaps in their defense, and hit our shots.”
The Crimson started the game with a balanced offensive attack that allowed it to gain early control of the game. The team scored six unanswered points to start the game and had baskets late in the period from Boehm and sophomore forward Rachel Levy.
The team’s variety of scorers at the start of the game was a consistent trade in a contest that saw five different players hit double digit points. The opening period ended with Harvard leading 16-14.
The second quarter was a back-and-forth affair that saw the two team trade the seven first baskets to start the quarter. A late 4-1 run by Penn saw the Quakers take away the Crimson lead and go into the half with a 28-27 lead.
Penn’s control of the third quarter was in large part due to its efficient scoring. The Quakers scored at 56 percent clip and made half of their threes en route to a 24 point quarter. The third period ended with Crimson having a 10 point deficit.
In the final frame, Harvard was able to beat Penn at its own game, playing suffocating defense in order to comeback and bring the game to overtime. With less than three minutes remaining in regulation, the Quakers regained the lead with pair of late free throws. On the final possession of the game, Bush grabbed a rebound and put in a basket with 0.6 seconds left in regulation to send the game to overtime.
In the overtime period, Penn was able to jump to an early advantage and pulled away when it extended its lead to eight.  Senior co-captain guard Sydney Skinner cut the deficit with back-to-back triples, but the Quakers scored late free throws to clinch the victory 75-70.
