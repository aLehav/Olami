MISREPRESENTING GOLDSTONE
To the editors:
In their April 7 editorial “Reclaiming Goldstone’s Missed Opportunity,” Avishai D. Don, Beth I. Drucker and Yair Rosenberg describe Richard Goldstone’s editorial in The Washington Post as a “retraction” of the UN report on abuses during the war in Gaza that he co-authored.
In fact, Goldstone did not retract the most damning accusations of the more than 500-page report. In a subsequent interview with The Associated Press, Goldstone said that “one correction should be made” but that he has “no reason to believe any part of the report needs to be reconsidered at this time.” Where is the “retraction” in this? Goldstone still believes that Israel’s attack was “designed to punish, humiliate and terrorize a civilian population.” Other than one incident which Goldstone says should be corrected, he sees no need to reconsider the Goldstone Report’s most damning claim: Israel used indiscriminate force in densely populated areas to collectively punish Palestinians in Gaza.
The authors’ misreading of Goldstone’s editorial is not only disappointing but dangerous. They are encouraging the sentiment espoused by Deputy Prime Minister Eli Yishai in 2009, who said “Even if the rockets fall in an open air or to the sea, we should hit their infrastructure, and destroy 100 homes for every rocket fired.” Rather than hold Israeli leaders accountable for the war crimes they order, the authors give Israel the green light to continue engaging in collective punishment in the future.

IDENTIFYING TRANSGENDER
To the editors:
The lead to the April 4 news article “Judge Lu To Hear Kirkland Case” unnecessarily draws attention to Debbie Moccia’s self-identification as transgender. The article describes Moccia as “a Level 3 sex offender and trans-identified” with a history of suicide threats. Including Moccia’s gender at the head of the article, especially amid a sentence that frames her suicide threats as a habitual recurrence, implies that her behavior is somehow tied to her transgenderism. While we hope this implication was unintentional, its resonance with stereotypes of transgender and gender non-conforming people as mentally unstable and dangerous makes it difficult to ignore.
Given The Crimson’s repeated calls for attention to the needs of transgender individuals and communities, we are anxious for a commitment to this ideal in its own reporting. We urge The Crimson to consider the contextual implications of reporting on gender identity in the future.

THINGS LEFT UNSAID
To the editors:
After reading Rachel Wagley ’11’s April 11 column, “Faith as a Lifestyle,” I had to run to the computer to double-check my facts. Was Dr. Lance Wallnau really the preacher who has equated Islam, gay people, and abortion with America’s financial melt-down? Was Os Hillman really a supporter of Uganda’s “Kill the Gays” bill, so named for its intent to make homosexuality punishable by death? After reassuring myself that, yes, these were the same people, I wondered why Ms. Wagley did not mention any of these facts in her column, which goes into great length describing the “hyperbolic sentiment” of the protestors at the recent Social Transformation conference, in which Wallnau and Hillman were featured speakers.
The central argument of Ms. Wagley’s column, that people should not equate secularism with pluralism, is fair enough. For evidence, however, she offers only one woman’s rhetorical flourish, “We don’t believe in God, we believe in the People,” and another student’s comments indicating that he didn’t think the conference should have been hosted at Harvard. From these remarks arises Ms. Wagley’s concern that we too often “attempt to solve human problems without the enlightenment of faith,” a conclusion that cannot be so casually inferred from such isolated statements.
But this is not what I find most troubling about Ms. Wagley’s argument. Rather, it is her unwillingness to point out that the protestors may have been present for reasons beyond a mere exercise in vocal secularism. The protestors did not oppose the actual theme of the conference, but rather the presence of speakers who have expressed hateful comments aimed at ethnic and sexual minorities, including statements made during similarly themed events in the past. For Ms. Wagley to dismiss the protestors’ comments as “concerns about abortion and homosexuality” is disingenuous and unfair. Similarly, her concession that Wallnau and Hillman are “not the greatest examples of tolerance or pluralism” is insufficient to convey the gravity of the vitriolic comments espoused by these two figures. Given the hefty criticism Ms. Wagley levied upon the sentiments of the protestors, it seems incongruous for her to underplay the offense people have taken to the incendiary comments of the event’s speaker. Ms. Wagley may strongly disagree with the spirit of the protest, but to skim over the protestors’ concerns is to do them an injustice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From vacuum tubes to transistors to semiconductors, from the telegraph to smart phones, technological innovation has been essential to America’s economic growth and global competitiveness. And behind every advance inevitably lies an engineer.
China, Korea, and India understand this well, graduating enormous numbers of new engineers each year. The debate about the need to train and produce more engineers to maintain U.S. competitiveness, however, has obscured an important issue. We don’t just need more engineers; we need a different kind of engineer. What we need are engineers who lead, driving not just inventions, but institutions.
The greatest challenges our country and the world face—energy, information access, climate change, sustainability, healthcare, economic development and growth, even financial reform—require the technical knowledge and analytical skills of people trained in the engineering sciences.
Consider the federal government. Of the 23 cabinet members, only the Secretary of Energy and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency have engineering or natural science backgrounds. Even they are exceptions. Of the 22 former heads of the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Agency, only three had engineering training. The majority were lawyers.
In Congress, out of 535 members, six are engineers and one is a physicist. (All told, there are more accountants, musicians, and talk show hosts.) By contrast, eight of the nine members of the Chinese Politburo, the highest-ranking officials in China, have engineering degrees.
Engineers have not fared much better in the private sector. While many engineers have founded startups, they rarely rise to the top of them or lead large organizations. A recent Spencer Stuart survey showed that of the CEOs in the S&P 500 companies, only 10 percent worked within the engineering function in their career. Forty-one percent of the CEOs worked in sales or marketing, and 26 percent in finance. None of the CEOs of Boeing, Cisco, GE, Hewlett Packard, IBM, Intel, Oracle, or United Technologies has a degree in engineering or the natural sciences.
Those who rise to the top of organizations do so in large part because of interpersonal and communication skills, tolerance for real-world ambiguity, and a holistic understanding of organizational needs. Business and law schools tend to attract people with these characteristics and then reinforce them by the nature of their programs and culture.
To provide a foundation for engineering leadership, engineering schools should take a lesson from law and business schools. We aspire to create a new generation of engineers who have deep technical training in a domain, and the breadth of knowledge and character to effectively collaborate with and lead others.
Of course, it takes a great deal of classroom and lab time to be prepared to solve complex technical challenges. The tolerance for error is low: Airplanes must fly, bridges must stand, and power plants must run.
Without aiming for a breadth of knowledge beyond just the technical though, universities risk educating engineers lacking the qualities required for corporate and government leadership. Thankfully, the philosophy of “engineering as a liberal art”—in which engineering discipline is part of a liberal arts curriculum, and students learn by working in multidisciplinary teams to solve real-world problems—is catching on.
For example, at Harvard College, a recent engineering graduate from Sierra-Leone, David Sengeh ’10, worked with researchers on refining an inhalable TB vaccine. Through NGOs he helped distribute mosquito nets in Africa. “It’s not enough just to be a good scientist,” he’s says. “You have to bring science to the smallest village to produce real social impact.”
Change is needed at the high school level as well. We applaud grassroots activities like the USA Science and Engineering Festival and efforts sponsored by the National Academy of Engineering. But schools must rethink what they teach. They have time-tested programs in chemistry, biology, physics and math, but why are there no engineering or computer science options?
Moreover, where are the opportunities for teenagers to build, break, and fix things? And how often are young students given the chance to connect what they’re learning in science class to ethics and policy and to creation of value in society?
The big challenges we face are too systemically and technologically complex—the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and the earthquake and tsunami in Japan are just two examples—to leave engineers out of leadership roles.
We need to bring a deeper level of analytical thinking and a new set of social and leadership skills to their education. By doing so, engineers will gain a well-deserved seat at the grown-ups table.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you weren’t at the Hillel last Friday night, it means that you missed my exceptional acting in a skit that I wrote to introduce our Wild West-themed Shabbat dinner. But it also means that you missed one of the most profound interfaith events I’ve ever attended on this campus.
Following a joint Jewish-Mormon dinner in the Hillel dining hall, Harvard students gathered to hear Mark Paredes, a Mormon who writes a column for the Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles on Latter Day Saints-Jewish relations. Paredes, as Yair Rosenberg ’11-’12, the organizer of the event, put it, has devoted his life to “explaining Jews to Mormons, and Mormons to Jews.” And his presence immediately catalyzed a no-holds barred discussion on every issue that had previously driven a wedge between LDS Church members and Jews—leaving me far more enlightened than after any other interfaith event I’ve been to on Harvard’s campus.
The LDS church has a philo-Semitic attitude at the core of its theology. Mormons either consider themselves blood descendents of the Israelite tribes or are adopted into a tribe upon conversion, and thus view themselves as the “House of Israel” as much as Jews. The Book of Mormon even argues that “ye need not any longer hiss, nor spurn, nor make game of the Jews…for behold, the Lord remembereth his covenant unto them.”
But there has been tension between these two faith communities in recent years. The LDS church has a longstanding practice to posthumously baptize ancestors via a genealogical database. Although it is official church policy not to submit names of people to whom church members are unrelated, Jewish groups discovered in the 1990s that Jewish Holocaust victims’ names appeared in this database. The church agreed to curtail its members from submitting these names in 1995, but Holocaust victims continued to reappear in the database as recently as 2008 (the issue was only formally resolved last year). Similarly, although the Church considers Jews to be a part of the Abrahamic covenant, Mormons nonetheless proselytize them. The title page of the Book of Mormon explicitly asserts that its goal is the “convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ.”
At an ordinary interfaith event, these politically charged issues would have probably been willfully ignored. But this was no ordinary interfaith event.
With an orthodox rabbi by his side, Paredes encouraged questions on these kinds of subjects and fielded them frankly, honestly, and unabashedly. He deftly distinguished between standard Mormon practice and the acts of a renegade few, while also refusing to apologize for a single tenet of the LDS church. It’s unthinkable to ask Mormons to refrain from baptizing their ancestors, Paredes explained to the Jews in the audience. “It would be like asking Jews not to circumcise their children.” But even then, he explained, baptism can only give the deceased the option of accepting Mormonism in the afterlife, and does not automatically make them Mormon. It’s similarly the case that Mormons must spread the good word of the Standard Works, but they don’t specifically target Jews—every non-Mormon is meant to hear these words.
As the organizers of the controversial Social Transformation conference recently reminded us, Harvard is an institution founded on religion that now mandates absolutely no discussion about religion in the classroom. Because of a zealous group of secular professors who saw no value in mandating an education in world religion (thanks a lot, Steven Pinker), Harvard abandoned its General Education requirement to study “Reason and Faith.” And although some Culture and Belief courses cover this ground anyway, a Harvard student could very easily leave this school without learning anything about a faith other than her own.
Naturally, intellectually curious Harvard students find ways of learning about other faiths even if are not taught about them in the classroom. Yet, even the most well intended interfaith events can turn into moments of self-adulation that eclipse the essential—and sometimes politically incorrect—questions that must be addressed between different religious communities. An attendee at such an event might make friends from another culture and taste their food, but at the end of the day the barriers created by these discomforting questions still exist.
True religious understanding and tolerance will only come once we confront issues that are often too embarrassing to discuss at standard interfaith events. Sometimes the questions that need to be voiced the most are the ones that deal with sensitive issues that cannot make for appropriate conversation at an interfaith dinner. I can honestly say that Paredes’s talk broke more barriers between me and my Mormon friends than would have a simple get-together over non-caffeinated beverages. It may not be feasible to structure all interfaith events as no-holds-barred press conferences, but the Friday night discussion left me with something far more valuable than a photo opportunity and a pat on the back.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The national conversation about guns on college campuses has taken an extreme turn of late. Last week, right here at Harvard, representatives from the National  Rifle Association  University, a subsidiary of the NRA, made the case for responsible gun ownership.  A few days later, Arizona lawmakers upped the ante by approving a bill that would permit guns on college campuses. In passing this bill, which now requires the consent of typically pro-gun Governor Jan Brewer, Arizona will follow Utah in legalizing firearms at universities. Texas legislators, in their infinite wisdom, are seeking to follow suit.
While this bill is clearly part of a local trend of escalating right-wing radicalism in Arizona, a state recently made infamous for its controversial immigration law and the Tucson shooting, it also belongs to a troubling national trend in which conservatives double-down on counter-intuitive proposals as a means of advancing their agenda.
On a superficial level, for instance, this particular bill has absurd practical implications. Although we generally support gun control, we cannot emphasize enough that the university atmosphere is particularly unfit for the unencumbered possession of firearms. After all, for students, universities are often high-stress environments dominated by a pervasive binge drinking culture and other social pressures that contribute to emotional instability. Why, then, would Arizona legislators strive to equip a typically irresponsible demographic of often-inebriated 18 to 22-year-olds with a Glock to go along with the handle of Rubinoff?
More illogical, however, is the idea that the bill in some way will allow students to defend themselves against another Virginia Tech-style massacre. As State representative and bill propenent David H. Gowan, Sr put it, “we’re allowing people to defend themselves.” In that sense, by allowing guns on campuses, Arizona seems to have extended the practical application of an ideological belief in firearms for self-defense to a new, unorthodox location.
Of course, Arizona in particular is all too familiar with the horror of lone gun rampages. Having witnessed the shooting of Gabrielle D. Giffords and 19 others in a shopping mall, it is not hard to draw connections between past atrocities that occurred at educational institutions, be it Virginia Tech or even Columbine. So when lawmakers speak of the need to allow students to defend themselves, it is reasonable to deduce that bills like this are designed to empower students to stop a repeat of Virginia Tech themselves.
Allowing students to carry guns, however, risks having the opposite effect. Those who have been responsible for campus shootings do not fit the profile of students who would be deterred by the promise of meeting armed resistance. Moreover, it is difficult to imagine that the average student going about his or her daily life will choose to carry a gun around campus, much less that current pro-gun lobbies at college will crystallize into a university militia. Instead, making it difficult to stop students from carrying guns at state colleges will make it more difficult for administrations and college police forces to keep campuses safe.
Also, the prospect itself of student militias helping to enforce the law or making guns a visible presence on campuses hardly seems conducive to the type of atmosphere that colleges seek to foster. In a mad dash for self-defense, students could easily heighten tension on their campuses and inhibit open debate if weapons are made a prominent feature of daily life. In this vein, it is useful to remember that faculty at Arizona state colleges—who know the minds of their students far better than state legislators ever could—have lobbied hard against this proposal, with the apparent support of many students.
In a broader sense, the effort to legalize guns on campuses (in our view at least) represents a more disturbing trend of recent attempts by conservative politicians to assume nonsensical positions for the sake of justifying their ideology, not because they actually happen to be good ideas. Most recently, Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan has proposed a budget that would seek to cut the deficit while cutting taxes for the wealthy. Another example is an earlier attempt by House Republicans to redefine the definition of rape itself in order to restrict access to abortion. On the same theme of gun restriction, yet another example is the push to legalize guns in bars in various states, including Virginia, Tennessee, and, of course, Arizona. In that sense, the real motivation behind this bill seems to be less about the safety of students than the defense against assaults on conservative dogma by doubling down on extremist ideas. This, more than anything, points to just how unnecessary, or even disastrous, this bill really is.

Editor's Note: Following the publication of this piece, the editors of Fifteen Minutes magazine discovered that the author is the publicity chair for the College Events Board, a group that plays a significant role in organizing Yardfest. Had the editors known of this, the author would not have been assigned to write this piece, as it is in violation of The Harvard Crimson's conflict of interest policy. The Crimson strongly and sincerely regrets this lapse.
This year marks Yardfest’s sixth birthday. FM tracks the growth and growing pains of this (costly) baby.
First Steps — 2006
The newly formed College Events Board (CEB) took control of College-wide social event planning and rechristened Harvard’s annual spring concert “Yardfest.” Seven thousand came to Tercentenary Theater to celebrate its debut, as Ben Folds belted out some crowd-pleasers. The baby had everyone’s blessings.
Terrible Two’s — 2007
Attendance took a nosedive at the second Yardfest, totalling 1,500-2,000 students. Officials blamed the rain. Crimson editors blamed the unfortunate choice of Third Eye Blind, which brought back painful memories of middle school. The weather was bleak, the food wet, and the band washed up. The whole event was a snooze.
Yardfest Takes Off — 2008
Thanks to an aggressive publicity campaign and a smarter choice of artists, Yardfest redeemed itself on its third birthday. On a warm, sunny Friday afternoon, 7,000 students left Lamont for the nine-member hip-hop group Wu-Tang Clan, and about 5,000 stayed for pop-rock artist Gavin DeGraw.
I’m a Big Boy Now — 2009
Electronic duo Ratatat and one-hit-wonder Sara Bareilles drew a record 7,100 undergraduates on a chilly Sunday evening. The highlight of the night came when Mike Stroud of Ratatat screamed wildly, “I love Harvard!” Like the rest of the attendees, he was probably drunk.
Not Your Average Kid — 2010
The fifth Yardfest featured both indie and hip-hop artists. Indie-folk artist Patrick Park had the unfortunate task of playing his first two songs to an audience of about 50. Students started to stream in for Wale’s rap interlude, and over 4,500 were present by the time headliner Kid Cudi ended the show with his most popular single, “Day ’n’ Nite.”
(Early) Puberty — 2011
This year, the six-year-old will go through some changes. Yardfest falls on the Sunday of Prefrosh Weekend, which means you should expect a horde of overly-enthusiastic 17-year-olds trying to beat you to the tire swings. It will take place in the Old Yard, not the Tercentenary Theater, so John Harvard can participate in all the fun and listen to this year’s lineup of Far East Movement, The White Panda, and Sam Adams.

The week before spring break of this semester, I had a lot to do: Monday, paper due, Tuesday, paper due, Wednesday, midterm exam, Thursday, midterm exam. On the other hand, last year, during my sophomore spring, I had six (count ’em, six) midterm exams spreading their wings across an entire semester.
If midterm assignments were mattresses, my current semester would represent those tiny cots I used to sleep on at camp—just a tad too tight, even by 12-year-old standards. My sophomore spring, on the other hand, would be a king-sized mattress. No, scratch that: it would be a Sealy California King Posturepedic mattress. Why do you need all that space? There were too many important tests taking place over too long a period. Last year, I was preparing for midterm exams essentially every other week, in addition to doing other regular problem sets, essays, and assignments.
Harvard students lament their tri-midterm courses. Some have a “midterm” one week into the semester or one week before Reading Period, leading us to ask why we even call them “midterms” at all. Occasionally, instructors try to cover up the misleading lexicon by terming them “hourlies.” Whatever their name, they still have a significant impact on students’ academic and social lives. Each is worth enough to justify losing a couple days of sleep, or having a weekend in, or forfeiting other homework.
Students must be held accountable to midterm exams and assignments, and I appreciate the opportunity to synthesize the material I have learned in a course. But Harvard’s current midterm structure undermines students’ abilities to do their best work; to complete other, non-graded homework; and often, to do nonacademic things that otherwise make them happy. Students consequently must focus on several, high-valued midterms, and the opportunity costs of doing “regular” homework for other classes is steep. Rather than making us better students, midterms as they currently function spread us thin.
Harvard’s unstructured and unwieldy midterm process demands reform. Much care is taken by the Registrar’s Office to prepare a final exam schedule, but this is not the case for midterms—even though students take them while balancing competing academic and extracurricular commitments. The Registrar and the College administration should think about ways to turn this disjointed mess into a clean, logical system.
Take Princeton, for example. Our friends from Dirty Jersey have one week each semester devoted to midterms and papers, followed by a one-week break (another novel idea: fall break!). Sure, it is probably an awful week, but it is still better to devote all of one’s efforts to a short, test-specific period than to compromise one’s priorities and come up short on all fronts. Furthermore, since all Princetonians are working at the same time, everybody’s staying in, and there’s no chance of missing out—unlike at Harvard, where some students miss out on Housing Day activities because they have a midterm, or simply don’t study.
Princeton’s system is imperfect, as they too offer some midterms over the course of the semester, but Harvard could adapt from their model. For classes that offer multiple “midterms,” the ones that took place during this week could be worth more. So students do not miss out on Harvard’s traditions, the midterm week could occur immediately before the Harvard-Yale Game and Thanksgiving break in the fall and Housing Day and March break in the spring.
But where would this extra week come from? Our long January break is one option. So are some of the days that mysteriously disappeared from Reading Period when the Harvard calendar switched (Reading Period was 12 days in Spring 2009 but will be just eight days this spring).
As it stands, midterm mania is miserable, almost as maddening as Liz’s lame ’literations. Until the Registrar and College administrators reconsider the midterm system, Harvard students will be seething—and probably doing so as they study for yet another exam.
—Elizabeth C. Bloom ’12 is a junior in Currier House. She hopes Harvard figures this “midterm” business out before Yardfest.

People talk of grade inflation at Harvard, but there actually is a class that gives out automatic A’s—if you discover a planet, that is.
The optional final project for Astronomy 16: Stellar and Planetary Astronomy, taught for the last two years by Professor David Charbonneau, the Director of Undergraduate Studies in Astrophysics, and this year by Dr. Douglas P. Finkbeiner, Associate Professor of Astronomy and of Physics, requires students to identify and trace the path of an exoplanet, a celestial body orbiting around another sun-like star. The task involves using a telescope to carefully track the brightness of a star over time, looking for drops in brightness resulting from a planet is passing.
Charbonneau, famous for discovering exoplanets himself (“That’s what I do,” he said), created the policy in 2009 because “problem sets and midterms are boring—they’re necessary for learning the material, but they’re boring.”
He added that he hoped to “get students excited about actual scientific research.”
Samuel M. Meyer ’13 was one of the students who succeeded at this project last spring. He and the three other members of Team Phoenix Ninja took three attempts to locate their exoplanet. The first night produced only “mediocre data,” and the second night’s try was obstructed by clouds. Despite initial difficulties, however, Meyer and his team were eventually successful.
“The data were rolling in on the third night, and I definitely had a feeling of pride and accomplishment in the work we’d done and the data we’d gathered,” said Meyer.
A precautionary note, however: only about 30 percent of students who attempt the project succeed, and it’s not meant to take the place of other course requirements.
“You can’t just blow off the class and at the end get an A,” said Finkbeiner. Indeed, the policy only applies to students who have received at least a C on all other portions of the class.
As Finkbeiner quipped: banking on the exoplanet project would be like “planning for retirement by counting on winning the lottery.” Those with sky-high hopes should take heed.

When I was little (read: the graveyard phrase of these such articles), heaven was a tangible, cheesy thing that for me was real, every single day, when at 4 p.m. I would be served a sumptuous Kraft macaroni and cheese dinner. Granted, the 30 minutes between arriving home from school and dinner were torturous, awkward stretches during which the normal social decorum between my mother and me simply did not endure—but in the end, as always, it was worth it. And, in the end, I thank my mother even more deeply for what the pasta gave me, beyond sustenance, vitality, 10 percent Vitamin A, and a noodle-like complexion: namely, a convenient last-minute framework for a self-indulgent, partially-nostalgic Crimson article.
The reasons that macaroni and cheese works as such a framework, though, could not have been portended from my youthful realm of bliss. Macaroni and cheese, for example, helped get me my girlfriend here. For our first date early this winter, I employed the classic ‘mack and cheese’ strategy: mack on the girl hard and then—trick play!—follow up with a cheesy date. The mack part never having really transpired, I instead dove right away into preparing a scrumptious pâtes au fromage, which you too can make at home:
1 box Annie’s Yummy Bunnies Macaroni & Cheese
1 box Annie’s Shells & White Cheddar
Honey Mustard
Olive oil
Bread crumbs
Parmesan cheese flakes
Shallots (or onions)
Mixed mushrooms assortment
1. Prepare both mac & cheeses, mixed together, using olive oil and honey mustard instead of milk and butter; simultaneously, finely dice shallots and mushrooms and grill with olive oil in pan.
2. Put everything together, drizzle with bread crumbs and parmesan chips.
After having finished cooking and doffing my apron, we went down to the river and had a picnic. Just last night, in fact, she was still ruminating on what a wonderful time it was, saying, “Yeah, we should definitely have a picnic soon! I haven’t had any picnics this year at school.” But that, after all, is the beauty of macaroni and cheese: it’s soft, mushy, it gives way to the hard spoon of posterity—and yet in the ephemeral moment in which it lingers on this earth, it brings happiness, warmth, goodness (and is also, apparently, a quite amenable accomplice to self-delusion).
But also, it just tastes really good.  And also, it’s a sort of masochistic but wonderful thing to write an article about when you’re starving and unable to go to lunch yet because of an article.
But though delayed gratification may be a part of writing articles, it finds no place in the bursting cheesiness of macaroni and cheese. Our sophomore year, my roommates and I lived in DeWolfe, and life was exactly as it should always be, once again: we had a kitchen, and we cooked large pots of macaroni and cheese nearly every night. It was our study break, our salve to inebriation, our pet project, our shared baby. And yet, despite the constant attention, it somehow never got old. One time near the end of that year, I was sitting on the third floor of Lamont at 3 a.m., still trying to choose a topic for a paper due the next morning. I was in a bit of a down slump to boot: because of a girl, because of the minor ego blow of not getting a certain finals club letter slipped under my door, because of two Red Bulls that had immediately dissipated into lifeless jitters. And then my roommate showed up with a Tupperware dish of .... Well, it was too personal a moment to share the details in print, so I’ll leave the contents a mystery.
But even when times are relatively unmarred by the Lamont-level tragedies of our placid lives, macaroni and cheese can still emerge heroic. At my high school (a boarding school) we used to have “feeds,” Saturday night post-curfew affairs in which the housemaster’s wife would bring down a huge pot of macaroni and cheese, causing the whole house to empty into the common room and crowd about it. And now too, I’ve found, in college, macaroni and cheese still has that same power: carry it into a room, and roommates will emerge from their rat holes, friends will suddenly knock—people who are normally so busy will convene, straight and simple. So that’s what I think of macaroni and cheese as, first of all: a social butterfly who was more popular than me in high school and is still sort of more popular than me. But second of all: as people-convener, a unifier, a gooey firmament that brings friends and family closer together, wherever in life one is.

Bad hair and bad decisions have a funny way of coinciding, and Plan b, a boutique hair salon on Mt. Auburn, is doing nothing to separate the two. If anything, it’s adding to the meaning of sex hair.
“Honestly, I didn’t even know about it when I came up with the name,” said Rick J. Fogarty, owner and stylist at Plan b, whose daughter had to fill him in on the fact that his salon shares a name with an emergency contraceptive pill.
For Fogarty, the name symbolized a new approach to his career. After years of working in other people’s salons, he decided it was time to become his own boss. “This was my plan B,” he explained.
And while he found that most people over the age of 30 thought of the term “plan B” by its more conventional definition—as a backup plan—those under the age of 25 had a different, or rather, more specific idea of what that backup plan meant.
Despite Fogarty’s innocent intentions, his salon’s name reveals two surprisingly interrelated concepts: grooming and contraception. Unprotected sex, much like going blond or getting a bob, is an irreversible occurrence, the outcome of which the woman must grapple with for the rest of her life (or until her next appointment).
Fogarty himself has been faced with more literal inquiries. Before the salon had opened its doors to clients, a couple of young women walked in, inquiring about the pill. “I think they thought it was a dispensary or something,” said Fogarty.

Every spring, high school seniors flock to Harvard’s campus for a single weekend filled with conspicuous red folders, campus events, and college parties. As Harvard students, it is our goal (or duty, rather) to show these prospective students a good time. Here are some surefire one-liners (cough pick-up lines cough) that should get the job done.
Pick-Up Line #1: Do you need a swipe?
Pick-Up Line #2: I go here.
Pick-Up Line #3: Want to check out a Harvard single?
Pick-Up Line #4: Want a tour (of the stacks)?
Pick-Up Line #5: So I’ll see you at the activities fair later? I’ll be working the Peer Contraceptive Counselors booth ....
Pick-Up Line #6: How do you like your Veritaffle?
Pick-Up Line #7: Ask me my SAT score.
Pick-Up Line #8: Maybe I could swipe you in to Sunday brunch.
Pick-Up Line #9: I’m going to be President. Will you be the Marilyn to my JFK?
Pick-Up Line #10: Let me get your number. Just in case you ever get lost.

Charles J. Hamilton III ’07 hasn’t been in an Atlanta Public School System classroom for a year, but he knows what his former students, now eight and nine-year-olds, are reading. “My advanced: “Diary of a Wimpy Kid.” They love all those books .... Some kids aren’t reading on grade level; from time to time you have to say ‘Come on you’re in third grade now, James.’” But the little square windows and maroon chairs with tennis balls on the legs to prevent squeaking are behind Hamilton; his two years in Teach For America’s (TFA) corps ended in 2010. But the weight he says he felt in his classroom of seven and eight-year-olds, all relying on him to escape the predetermined “school to prison pipeline,” still hangs heavily.
Hamilton is one of 51 former corps members now enrolled at Harvard Law School. Based on numbers released by the Law School Admission’s Office, that number is on the rise: with 22 former corps members in the first year class, 17 in the second year class, and 12 in the third year class, TFA’s presence at the Law School has risen by nearly half since three years ago.
Teach For America was founded in 1990 by Wendy Kopp with the mission of building a “movement to eliminate educational inequity by enlisting our nation’s most promising future leaders in the effort,” according to the TFA website.
TFA places corps members in under-resourced—and often heartbreaking—school systems in the country, with the aim of changing the trajectory of students enrolled there. Hamilton taught at Deerwood Academy, an Atlanta Public School in the poor, majority-black Southwest section of the city. Only 34 percent of black males in the school system graduate, and many spend time in the juvenile justice system before turning 20.
“I would hear administrators and teachers talk about second graders and elementary school kids as if their future is predetermined,” Hamilton says. “Saying, ‘Well it’s only a matter of time until he’s tangled up in the criminal justice system.’” But “the most important thing is not believing that,” Hamilton says. “You don’t accept it. The mission is to make your kids the exception, period.”
With surprising uniformity, former corps members at the Law School say that they plan to be involved in education reform, particularly in low income communities, after earning their JDs. These students profess that their experience in TFA had a profound impact not only on their worldviews but also on their ambitions for the future.
Of course, Harvard Law School is ranked second in the U.S. News & World Report, and as is usually the case, admissions rewards prior success. According to the New York Times, in 2007, about 10 percent of TFA students leave the program after the first of their two years. It is possible that those who had positive experiences with TFA are also those who are now enrolled here. Additionally, the program has fallen under scrutiny for not producing lifelong, master teachers, but rather 22-year-olds who spend two years doing brief service. But for many students at the Law School, TFA has become a epiphanic moment. It’s an experience they have come to order their lives around, a guiding map for the future beyond the wood-panelled lecture halls of Harvard Law.
CORPS TAKING OVER
For Law School second year Kristi Jobson ’06, being a freshman proctor in Wigglesworth and an elementary school teacher in the South Bronx could not be more different.
“There’s nothing like being in charge of a classroom full of students,” Kristi says. “It was one of the first times in my life I really felt like I was bad at something—I felt really overwhelmed and like I could really do better.”
In addition to teaching social studies to older students and English-as-a-second-language classes to all age groups, Kristi introduced a dance program at P.S.-M.S. 15—using skills she learned during her involvement with Harvard CityStep, which she credits with inspiring her to teach in the first place.
Though Kristi is among a small group of alums of both Harvard College and TFA that are currently at the Law School, she is a part of a much larger community of Harvard students affiliated with TFA.
More and more, Harvard and TFA have begun to act like complementary feeder organizations.
In the Harvard College class of 2010, 293 seniors—nearly a fifth of the class—applied for TFA. Only 100 seniors applied three years earlier, in 2007.
This boom in applications from the College corresponds to a national trend: since 2007, applicants to TFA have increased over 250 percent—a spike that many attribute to the economic breakdown—and between 2009 and 2010, applications increased by 32 percent.
The increasingly selective group of college graduates who accept their offer to TFA are going to increasingly selective graduate schools: TFA lists Harvard Graduate School of Education, Harvard Business School, and Harvard Kennedy School of Government as the education, business, and policy graduate schools with the highest amount of former corps members enrolled. The Law School is the third most common law school for former corps members, topped by the University of Pennsylvania Law and Georgetown Law.
Assistant Dean and Chief Admissions Officer Joshua Rubenstein says that the admissions office “ends up admitting a lot of TFA alums” in part because of their experience in the classroom. “A major component of what we look for is leadership experience and commitment in service. TFA produces people who we would score strongly on both of those attributes.”
He says that the Law School takes into account that the candidates who worked for TFA had the option to do a number of things, but chose to teach in under-resourced environments, where ingenuity and creativity were integral to facilitate gains among students.
Rubenstein notes that since TFA is such a selective organization already, the corps members would have been attractive candidates regardless of their TFA experience.
“[TFA] seems like an organization that has pretty high selection standards, and it selects people who already might be good candidates for law school,” Rubenstein says.
Law School third year Leah M. Watson, a 2005 Atlanta corps member, planned to become a journalist to report on social ills—social ills she saw first hand as a World History and Political Science teacher to ninth and 10th graders at Westlake High School. Many of her students couldn’t excel because of the challenges they faced outside of the classroom; some didn’t have places to live, many had family trouble, some became pregnant, and some didn’t have enough to eat—one of her students was even hospitalized for malnutrition. After a year at Westlake, she decided being a journalist wasn’t good enough. Going to the Law School instead would help her in her quest to address broad institutional problems.
“I think going to Harvard Law School gives credibility in the game,” Watson says.
Although Watson doesn’t know which angle she will take to help catalyze institutional progress, she gave examples of how lawyers can help implement change: they can draft language for education reform, for example, or represent special education students, work in federal, state, or local education departments.
“Talking about it wasn’t going to be enough,” Watson says. “I needed to take ownership of doing that work.”
“CATCHING THE BUG”
No landline, no signal, no mail delivery, and no internet. Her first two years after college, Hanseul Kang was “totally unreachable.” After graduating from Georgetown College—immersed in an overwhelmingly white student body on a campus of Kate Spade and Betsy Johnson accessories—King moved to Thoreau, New Mexico—a town with a population of barely three thousand—to teach social studies in a school that was majority Navajo Indian.
Kang says she intended to apply to law school after her time in the corps to study international law policy. But after two years in the corps, she changed her mind.
“At one point I felt like it was my responsibility to carry the success I’d had forward into a career that seemed very prestigious,” Kang continues. “Through teaching and working with my students, I wanted to pay that forward not just during two years—I wanted to continue giving students similar opportunities that I had had.”
Like thousands of other corps members, she had caught “the bug.”
“The vast difference between school systems in this country can make you very angry in a productive way—in a way that’s not going to go away until you’ve seen gains,” Jobson explains. “Sometimes people describe it as the bug.
Jobson—who says all but one of her friends from TFA are still teaching—dreamed about one day being a litigator. But, like every other corps member interviewed for this article, she says she now feels passionate about using her law degree to reform education or serve low-income communities.
“You’re not able to let go,” Jobson says.
The numbers support Jobson’s claim—corps members are quantifiably not able to “let go.” Sixty-three percent of TFA alums are in the field of education, while nearly 10 percent are full-time graduate students, and four percent are in the field of law, according to information released by TFA.
Watson says that sometimes, being so far away from the classroom is a source of frustration.
“It’s hard going from throwing yourself 100 percent in the field, and being able to sleep at night, to going to law school, which is kind of a more selfish endeavor,” Watson says.
But a Bronx 2005 corps member, former recruitment director for TFA at Harvard, and current Law School second year Meredith D.L. Boak says that former corps members’ experience giving 100 percent in the classroom gives them purpose in their graduate school endeavors.
“You know exactly why you’re coming to law school,” Boak says. “You are going to want to go back into the community and help your kids. The motivation that drives you really can help you to be more successful.”
TEACH FOR AMERICA AMID CONTROVERSY
When Law School first year Tim M. Visser arrived at his classroom at Little River Elementary School in the Little Haiti neighborhood of Miami, he wasn’t the first one there. It was 6:30 a.m., but eight fifth graders were waiting for morning tutorial. More than 12 hours later at 7 p.m., Visser would have to force students to go home.
Visser saw the entire fifth grade—around 100 students—all of whom were three to five years behind, all of whom had been “left behind or passed on.” But once they had someone in the classroom who was willing and able to work with them, they latched on.
“Without fail, my kids were as motivated or more motivated than I was,” Visser says. “It was personally motivating.” (Visser used some iteration of the word “motivating” multiple times in his interview for this article.)
Like Kang, Watson, and Boak, Visser realized that in order to help the kids in Little Haiti on a macro level, he needed to go to law school.
“I understand some of the more systemic and policy based aspects of the problem,” Visser says. “I realized how much power a law degree has in changing those.”
Before attending law school, though, Little River encouraged Visser to work with TFA. Though there were already five or six corps members at the school—which was otherwise staffed with teachers who often did not have the requisite education to teach, Visser says the school hoped more corps members could come and alleviate the shortage of teachers.
Though TFA corps members may have facilitated the continued operation of an appreciative Little River Elementary, there remains controversy about the place and effectiveness of TFA in public school systems.
Some critics say that the program fails to foster real teachers—only teachers who quit the profession for graduate school or a more prestigious job before mastering their skills. Though 61 percent of corps members stay to teach at their assigned school past the two year requirement, few are remaining after the fifth or sixth year.
President Obama, adding to the din surrounding the program, praised TFA last April.
“I’ve seen a rising generation of young people work and volunteer and turn out in record numbers,” Obama said. “They have become a generation of activists possessed with that most American of ideas—that people who love their country can change it.”
Regardless of the laudability of the young volunteers, a study produced last summer suggests that corps members might prepare students less for standardized tests that assess knowledge and comprehension.
A study by Dr. Julian Vasquez Heilig of the University of Texas at Austin’s College of Education, and Dr. Su Jin Jez, of California State University, Sacremento, says that although corps members perform better than non-credentialed teachers, the report notes that “the students of novice TFA teachers perform significantly less well in reading and mathematics than those of credentialed beginning teachers.”
Despite the contested effectiveness of placing 22-year-olds in some of America’s toughest classrooms, the experience can serve as an awakening for young people in the program to passions about policy and justice.
“It just became so real when it goes from a statistic to a real student when you understand how grossly unequal it is,” Visser says. “They’re so talented, so bright …  they just have to climb over hurdles other kids don’t have to.”
All of these corps members, of course, have moved on to some degree, out of the classroom. Hamilton, for one, found, after two years, that teaching was not his true calling. But the burden doesn’t disappear. Both Visser and Hamilton, for example, expressed interest in helping to ensure the eradication of the “school to prison pipeline” that they witnessed in their respective cities.
While explaining the struggle to have faith in students despite overwhelming opposition to such faith—outside influences, a system that already assumes the worst, communities stricken with poverty, drugs asnd violence—Hamilton himself struggles to express his emotions: “You just, you don’t believe it ... The most important things is not believing that. You don’t accept that ... There’s no reason it can’t happen. You need to believe.”
It’s a belief that haunts many corps members; one that has driven Hamilton and his fellows to the Law School, in order to affect changes in the classrooms they left behind.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tony Porter, co-founder of A Call to Men, told a mostly male audience that the dominant perceptions of manhood must change before real progress can be made in the fight against violence towards women, during a presentation at the CGIS Tsai Auditorium last night.
Porter—whose organization raises awareness of domestic violence and promotes “healthy manhood”—led an interactive, hour-long lecture. At times Porter asked the members of the audience to respond to questions about their perception of manhood and the roles of men and women in society.
“Envision the world you want to see for your daughters as we have this talk,” he instructed the young men in the crowd at the beginning of his presentation. “Also think about the kind of man you want your son to be.”
Many members of groups sponsoring the event—including various fraternities, men’s sports teams, and final clubs—attended the talk, which was part of Take Back the Night 2011, a month at Harvard dedicated to creating awareness of sexual violence, empowering assault survivors, and building community.
Porter and the other members of A Call to Men have worked with the NBA, NFL, U.S. military, and various colleges and universities across the country to stress the importance of treating women equally and with respect.
Last night, he outlined a stereotypical “Male Box” and asked the audience what types of characteristics and actions are expected to be inside of it. Audience members suggested adjectives such as “strong,” “tough,” “successful” to fill in the box. Porter added anecdotes from his own past as well as examples from sports and movies to illustrate the discrepancies between men and women that exist inside men’s heads.
“It’s very important for us as men to be in control,” Porter said. “Being out of control is reserved for who? Women. We, as men, put a tremendous amount of effort into not being connected to women in that way.”
Seth Avakian, a prevention specialist at the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response who helped to organize the event, said he was impressed by the turnout.
“I’m excited to see so many guys participate,” he said. “Not just come and listen, but to actually participate in the presentation and to talk about masculinity and the ways in which it has shaped our roles in society.”
During the talk, Porter stressed that the young men surrounding him were probably not “bad guys,” gesturing with his arms to show the small percentage of men in the world who can be thrown into that category and a much larger percentage of men who treat women well.
“How is it that this many men do what they do to women in the presence of all of us good men?” he asked.
After receiving blank stares, he made clear that the men in front of him had an obligation to use their power to prevent the mistreatment of women on a larger scale.
“If women could end the violence by themselves, they would have,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Delegates from the Chinese government signed an agreement yesterday with Harvard that leaders hope will bring more Chinese students to seven Harvard graduate and professional schools.
According to the agreement, the China Scholarship Council, a non-profit affiliated with the Ministry of Education, will contribute to the living expenses, air-fare, and tuition of up to 20 Chinese master students and 15 doctoral students each year.
“There are 541 Chinese students studying across many fields of learning at the University this academic year, and we hope that by signing this agreement we will open the gates of the University to even more,” University spokesperson Kevin Galvin wrote in an emailed statement.
The agreement, signed by Vice Provost for International Affairs Jorge I. Domínguez and CSC Secretary General Liu Jinghui, states that Harvard will retain full control of the admissions process. There will be a separate application for funding from CSC.
The schools listed in the agreement are the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the Harvard Business School, the Graduate School of Design, the Graduate School of Education, the Harvard Kennedy School, the Harvard Law School, and the School of Public Health.
The agreement comes after Chinese President Hu Jintao’s January meeting with President Obama, during which the two leaders
agreed to further support student exchange between the two nations.
“Harvard faculty have a long-standing relationship with China [and] our institutional commitment to China is deep, dating back to the 1800s,” Domínguez read from a letter by University President Drew G. Faust, who was unable to attend the ceremony. According to Faust, the University will continue this tradition and further promote the academic exchange with China.
Echoing Faust’s letter, Chinese State Councilor and the delegation head Liu Yandong cited Harvard’s long history of involvement with China and praised it for its leadership in the academic world.
“Harvard has been one of the first universities to accept Chinese students,” Liu Yandong said, adding that it is also one of the first universities to study China. The Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies, for example, is the first center for research in China established in the United States.
“I think it’s fair to say that most Chinese people know well about Harvard and Harvard knows well about China,” she said.
The ceremony, hosted in a Loeb House heavily guarded by security, was followed by a lunch with some Harvard professors related to Chinese studies and government officials.
The delegation then visited MIT in the afternoon, where it was received by MIT President Susan Hockfield.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Omar Barghouti, a Palestinian activist and one of the founders of the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel, said that Israel is currently functioning under a system of apartheid at an event sponsored by the Palestine Solidarity Committee and the Institute of Politics yesterday.
Barghouti, who is on a tour for his new book “Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions: The Global Struggle for Palestinian Rights,” said that Israel’s current system draws a distinction between Israelis and Palestinians in applications for citizenship.
Because of this “apartheid” system, Barghouti challenged the idea that Israel should be a respected democracy on the international stage.
“A state that occupies, a state that ethnically cleanses, a state that burns books, a state that is an apartheid can never be a democracy,” he said.
Barghouti’s visit to the United States came after months of waiting as he initially applied to the U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem for a visa in October. He was notified that he was granted a visa in January, but did not receive it until March.
Although he was not officially told of any reason for the visa delay besides “pending further administrative processes,” Barghouti said that he believed the delay was politically motivated.
In response to critics who suggest that allowing refugees to return and giving Palestinians equal standing in Israel is an attempt to destroy Israel by shifting the country’s demographics, Barghouti said that their argument reflects badly not on Palestinian activists, but on the state of Israel.
“Equality never destroys people. It destroys a racist system,” he said.
When asked about how Palestinians should combat Israel, Barghouti said that he supports a non-violent approach.
“Even the oppressed, even the colonized do not have a blank check to attack indiscriminately another community, so I can never condone any attack on non-combatant Israelis,” he said.
However, he added that it is not the oppressed, but the dominant powers who are always the instigators of the violence.
“There is absolutely no comparison in the level of violence perpetrated by the perpetrator, the occupying power, and that of the resistance,” said Barghouti. “To end all violence, you must eliminate the roots of violence, which is occupation and apartheid.”
Despite his criticism of Israel, Barghouti described himself as a “universalist” as he rejects all types of injustice, including anti-Semitism.
Students said it is important to bring the Palestinian voice to campus because they believe it is one that is not readily available.
“I’m glad he got his visa and was able to come to Harvard, because I feel like its such an important movement and one of the most peaceful ways to solve the problem,” said Asmaa Rimawi ‘14. “It’s something Harvard needs to start thinking about.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction.
CORRECTION: APRIL 17, 2011
The April 14 article "Barghouti Urges Israel Boycott" misstated where Omar Barghouti received his visa. It was the U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem, not the U.S. Embassy, which is in Tel Aviv, that granted him a visa.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In response to concerns voiced by students in the Undergraduate Council’s social life survey, the UC’s Social Programming Task Force (SPTF) has coordinated a surprise event for the Harvard undergraduate body, taking place in front of the Science Center today from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.
The event, which the UC has kept secret from the student body, was only publicized by a single “teaser” email sent out to students last week. Otherwise, the UC has requested that the exact details of the event remain concealed.
“We want to maintain some element of surprise so that students walking by the Science Center this afternoon have the privilege of stumbling upon spontaneous fun and random silliness,” said UC SPTF Chair Crystal D. Trejo ’13. “We want to create more experiences with random Harvard fun where you can build memories without being stressed out about classes.”
The SPTF, a recently established committee, was created to organize free events and has the stated goal of unifying the student body.
Today’s event—which had originally been scheduled for April Fool’s Day but was postponed due to inclement weather—will be the first one hosted by the new committee.
“You see a lot of protests and political events on campus, but not a lot of events just for fun,” Trejo said. “We all go to Harvard and we’d all like a break.”
This first event also comes amidst a growing conversation about campus social spaces. SPTF members say they have joined the discussion and hope to achieve progress by uniting the student body and eliminating exclusivity, according to UC Rules Committee Chair and SPTF member David H. A. LeBeouf ’13, who is also a Crimson news editor.
“We want students to see that the UC is listening to what they’re saying and we are coming up with ways to respond,” said LeBeouf. “We are always open to feedback and ultimately, we really want to build a give-and-take relationship with the student body.”
At the committee’s inception, its original goal was to host three free events by the end of the semester. However this goal has proven to be more difficult than the committee originally anticipated, according to Trejo.
“It has been a huge process and trying to plan an event is just as hard as trying to create new legislation,” Trejo said. “We’ve realized that coordinating with different organizations, different vendors, and different parts of campus has several obstacles.”
Still, the SPTF has successfully planned and coordinated a second program for the semester. The event—titled “Lights Out”—will be a free dance for all undergraduates, to be hosted in Annenberg on April 23.
“We will be bringing an old Harvard tradition of dances in Annenberg into the 21st century,” Trejo said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A record 1,350 admitted students are expected to descend upon Cambridge this weekend for Visitas, Harvard College’s visiting program for prospective freshmen.
The program, which includes a variety of different events designed to expose visitors to all facets of the College, officially begins on Saturday and lasts until Monday afternoon.
“I think people have really different experiences once they are students here. Prefrosh weekend is the beginning of that,” said Visiting Program Director Valerie A. Beilenson ’07. “The goal of the weekend is to expose students to all that Harvard has to offer.”
Students had until April 6—just one week after they received admissions decisions—to notify the College that they would be attending the program.
Because Visitas is being held a week earlier than in years past, Beilenson said she had been concerned that fewer students would be able to attend.
While that concern was mollified by the record number of sign-ups, she said that many parents and families that wanted to attend have had difficulties finding accommodations because of the Boston Marathon and Harvard Alumni Association events this weekend.
Visitas will also for the first time coincide with Yardfest, the spring concert for students at the College put on by the College Events Board.
While Beilenson said that the scheduling of Visitas was separate from that of the concert, she believes that Yardfest will have a positive impact on the experience of visiting students by allowing them to see the whole student body in one place.
“It does present a different perspective, but the goal is to show them lots of different Harvards,” said Beilenson, responding to the criticism that Yardfest does not accurately represent typical life at Harvard.
In addition to officially bearing the name Visitas for the first time, this year’s program has changed substantially from the program last year.
The faculty panels designed to introduce students to the various departments have been retooled in the vein of the popular Harvard Thinks Big lectures. Beilenson said that this would make these panels more dynamic than in years past.
For students comparing Harvard to other highly selective universities, Visitas falls in the middle of the fray.
Princeton’s first visiting program begins relatively early on April 7, while Stanford’s program does not begin until April 28.
Admitted students have until May 1 to inform Harvard of whether they plan to attend. Still, Beilenson said she believes the purpose of the weekend is not simply to sell students on Harvard but rather to share what the school has to offer.
“Some of those kids will decide to come, others won’t,” she said. “It’s really supposed to  be a slice of life.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School Professor Alan M. Dershowitz has taken on a high profile international case defending former Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma against accusations of attempted murder.
Kuchma, 72, was accused last month of ordering the murder of journalist Georgiy Gongadze, who was kidnapped in 2000 and found headless soon after outside Kiev.
Kuchma has denied any connection with the murder.
The primary evidence against Kuchma is a tape recording in which opponents argue Kuchma can be heard complaining about Gongadze and allegedly urges someone to take care of the problem.
Kuchma was also blamed in 2000, but the prosecutors dropped the case after discovering the tape may have been doctored.
The case resurfaced recently, with Dershowitz choosing to lead the defense.
“There are two terrible crimes here,” Dershowitz said. “One is the murder of a journalist ... the second is trying to frame somebody who isn’t guilty for having committed this terrible crime.”
Dershowitz has a history with such high-profile cases, having defended O.J. Simpson and the socialite Claus von Bulow among others.
He said that he is interested in what he described as the intriguing combination of modern science and politics in the Kuchma case.
Dershowitz and his group of Ukrainian attorneys are working with leading scientists to find places in the tape where tampering seems to have occurred, he said.
Dershowitz said he is familiar with instances of tape tampering.
While defending von Bulow against attempted murder charges, Dershowitz experienced tape tampering first-hand when someone recorded him and rearranged the tape to change the meaning of his words.
The doctoring of that tape was easy to prove, Dershowitz said, since the cut marks on the analog recording were visible.
In the Kuchma case, the defense must locate tampering marks on a digital recording.
Dershowitz, who returned from Kiev on Tuesday, said that the case offers the unique challenge of learning Ukrainian law and of working in a foreign environment with local law students.
But Dershowitz said he sees great significance in the case and its relation to the “rule of law and the evolution of democracy in Ukraine.”
He said he believed it to be “the most important case in modern Ukrainian history.”

Relegated primarily to elementary school playgrounds, taunting, name-calling, and insult-lobbing have made their way into the houses of Congress, according to a study released by Stanford and Harvard professors.
Assistant Professor Justin R. Grimmer of Stanford and University Professor Gary King of Harvard found that 27 percent of congressional press releases that their team analyzed consisted of “partisan taunts.”
In fact, while on the job, not only do members of Congress insult each other, but they sometimes make it their primary goal, King said.
The methodology used could eventually reveal who in Congress are the biggest taunters.
This finding was couched in an eight-page paper published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in February.
The research focused on finding a way to have computers classify data in order to discover “insightful conceptualizations.”
“We are really lame at zooming out and making sense of the whole corpus of information, at the same time,” King said.
The study started by analyzing press releases from Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg, a Democrat from New Jersey who famously called Republicans “chicken hawks” in a floor speech in the Senate.
The study took these releases for an initial test of the methodology, which involves creating clusters of similar data.
After also analyzing a State of the Union address from President Bush and a series of Reuters articles, the team took 64,033 press releases from 2005 to 2007 to estimate the presence of taunting.
From those releases, Grimmer and King found not only that 27 percent of releases are taunts, but that taunting increases when a senator faces less competition in his or her state.
The study began more than three years ago, when it was initiated by King and a group of graduate students.
The goal of the study was to develop a way to understand large quantities of information.
Now, King hopes to be able to determine whether Democrats or Republicans are responsible for the majority of political put-downs and whether taunts tend to be employed by particular congressmen over others.
Still, King didn’t hold congressmen solely responsible for the taunting, saying that they seem to be responding to incentives and doing the exact things that get them reelected.
“The whole point of democracy is to represent, and if they want to do so by taunting each other, they will keep doing just that,” King said.

Phil N. Angelides ’74, chair of a federally-appointed commission charged with deconstructing the events of the 2008-2009 financial recession, lectured Wednesday afternoon at the Harvard Business School on the ethical responsibility of today and tomorrow’s financial leaders.
The lecture was sponsored by the Leadership and Values Committee, a student-led initiative comprising first and second year Business School students that seeks to merge the theory and practice of leadership, business ethics, and values.
Angelides served as chairman for the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, a commission appointed to investigate the Wall Street practices that led to the economic downturn of 2008-2009.
The Commission’s findings were released in January, and Angelides has spent much of his time since presenting the analysis to business leaders and students around the country and abroad.
In his lecture, Angelides emphasized that the financial crisis was avoidable and a direct result of human actions, recklessness in the financial sector, and the failure of regulators to protect the public.
Citing how officials in Washington describe the economic climate as a “perfect storm,” Angelides dismissed these claims and attributed much of the recent economic turmoil to poor leadership.
“What motivates me is that in the past year and a half I met so many families who were doing everything right, but then found themselves losing their jobs and losing their homes,” Angelides said. “I want to stand up for them and make sure it doesn’t happen again.”
Angelides encouraged students to gain experience in the public realm in addition to the private sector. He challenged audience members to help manage the financial system for the public good in their careers.
“He explained how we can keep a head on our shoulders,” William J. Fotsch, a student organizer, said. “We have to pay attention to the ethical implications of the business decisions we make.”
Angelides said he had deep concerns about the future, but he was ultimately optimistic about the capacity for ethical responsibility in leadership.
“Capital doesn’t have a conscience, but the people that manage capital do,” Angelides said.
HBS first year students Christopher B. Johnson ’07 and Fotsch organized the event in conjunction with Senior Lecturer on Business Administration Nicolas P. Retsinas, who additionally acted as moderator for the event.
“We wanted students to hear Phil’s perspective on how things went wrong, how things can change in the future, and most importantly—how you can act as a moral leader in an industry where it is tempting to be less-than-ethical at times,” Johnson said.

The newly opened restaurant The Maharaja is bringing fine Indian dining to the second floor of the Galeria on JFK Street, moving into the former location of the Bombay Club.
The restaurant, which opened on March 14, aims to emulate the atmosphere of an Indian palace, featuring traditional Indian decor on the exterior and interior.
“We wanted to make it more of a destination instead of just pictures of India. We decided to get decor directly from India,” said Aman Thakur, who owns the restaurant along with his two partners Sajal Latka and Rohit Talwar.
“There are lots of smaller ‘hole in the wall’ restaurants, but we wanted to spend a little more and attract people from throughout Boston and Cambridge.”
The restaurant’s recipes are based on royal Indian cuisine, according to Latka.
“It’s an exotic cuisine with all its flavors, but it’s also the whole ambiance,” Latka said. “We want our guests to sit down and enjoy a different cuisine with a beautiful view of Harvard Square and not feel rushed.”
The three partners have previously founded three Indian restaurants in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, all of which are called India Palace.
However, the partners decided to name the Harvard Square restaurant Maharaja, which means “the king of kings,” according to Thakur.
“We wanted a different name to give this restaurant its own identity,” he said.
The restaurant has not held an official grand opening yet, instead opting to wait for a liquor license.
The Maharaja is one of several Indian restaurants in Harvard Square, including Tanjore and Tamarind Bay.
Tamarind Bay owner Vik Kapoor said he is glad to see that the location of Bombay Club has been filled. While both his restaurant and the Maharaja offer Indian cuisine, they vary in style, he said.
“Tamarind Bay stands by what we have done for the last five or six years. We have a limited menu with very authentic food. Maharaja is offering everything under the sun. It’s a different kind of concept,” Kapoor said.
The Maharaja has 2,400 square feet of seating with 120 seats, and is open from 11:30 a.m. to 11 p.m. daily for a lunch buffet in the early afternoon and for dinner. However, the restaurant may expand its hours in the future to create a weekend lounge.
Latka said that although the decor may make the restaurant seem more upscale, the restaurant offers reasonable prices. Customers will receive a 15 percent discount with any student ID.
Denise A. Jillson, the executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said the owners are “terrific community partners.”
“They hosted the 101st annual meeting and breakfast for the HSBA even before they officially opened and welcomed over 120 HSBA members and the Cambridge City Council and the mayor to a wonderful breakfast,” Jillson said.
Latka said he is hoping to increase their connections with the community and other businesses.
“Boston is one of the best business markets, and this place needed good Indian food. There are some good Indian restaurants here, but we are hoping to be a big one,” he said.

A Harvard University Police Department officer has filed a complaint against the University for discrimination.
The plaintiff, George F. Pierce, alleged in the complaint that Harvard was “intentionally discriminating against him on account of his race and color.”
The complaint, which was filed last month, said that HUPD “acted with evil motive and with reckless indifference to Pierce’s rights.”
Pierce, who is African-American, has worked at Harvard since May 2002 as a patrol officer.
Since 2002, HUPD has promoted nine patrol officers to sergeant status, none of whom were minorities, according to the complaint. Pierce was the only applicant of color to apply for the sergeant position, according to the complaint.
Pierce’s attorney Ellen J. Messing said that Pierce hopes that his case will result in his promotion to sergeant.
Before coming to Harvard, Pierce worked for 21 years for the Massachusetts Department of Corrections, according to Messing.
“He believes his qualifications are at least equal to or better than the Caucasian officers,” Messing said.
“He wants a bias-free procedure for handling these promotions,” she said.
The University declined to comment for this article.
“The HUPD will not comment on personnel matters and pending litigation,” Steven G. Catalano, HUPD spokesperson, wrote in an email.
The complaint alleges that the Department “created and maintained a racially-biased environment” which was supported by top management. According to the complaint, supervising officers have made openly racial statements such as “I hate blacks,” have used derogatory terminology, and have complained that HUPD “had” to hire more African-Americans.
“It takes an enormous amount of courage and tenacity to file a lawsuit against one’s current employer,” Messing said.
The complaint requests that HUPD promote Pierce to the position of sergeant and pay for the compensatory and punitive damages incurred during the case.
Pierce is undeterred by concerns that the complaint will strain his relationship the University or HUPD, Messing said.
“Officer Pierce is in this for the long haul and he understands that he has taken a challenging position because he is still working [at Harvard],” she said.
“[He] has a lot of friends and colleagues in the Department and good relationships with his colleagues and he doesn’t see that diminishing because he’s doing the right thing.”
According to Messing, the case was originally pending at the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination but was removed so that he could file a federal complaint instead.
Messing said that Pierce felt that the case could be most effectively addressed in a court proceeding, which is how similar cases are often resolved.
Messing said that her firm has handled a number of cases of against Harvard and HUPD on issues relating to discrimination, including a 2002 gender discrimination case that was eventually resolved at the Massachusetts Supreme Court.
“Some of the cases Harvard has been very interested in resolving, and some they have not had an interest in resolving,” Messing said.
“We are hopeful that they will want to resolve this case, but we can’t rely on that.”

With a potentially lucrative coaching offer beckoning in South Florida, Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker leveraged interest shown by the University of Miami to secure guarantees of resources for him and his coaching staff, including a pay increase for his assistant coaches and future work on Lavietes Pavilion, according to a booster involved in men’s basketball.
Amaker met with officials from the University of Miami on Monday, sparking fears that the coach credited with bringing the school a share of its first-ever men’s basketball Ivy championship would leave Cambridge. But the next day, Amaker announced that he would remain at the helm of the Crimson.
“I am appreciative of and flattered by the interest shown in me by other fine universities, but I am proud and honored to represent Harvard,” Amaker said in a press release.
His continued presence at Harvard will come with additional perks to the program here, according to the booster, a member of the alumni organization Friends of Harvard Basketball.
“I’d say that, as a result of this, the Friends are stepping up their efforts even more than what we did prior to this—absolutely,” the booster said, who was granted anonymity to maintain his relationship with Harvard.
While there were a number of factors affecting Amaker’s decision—including his wife’s position as a faculty member at the Harvard Medical School—the additional promises likely made it easier to turn down overtures from the Hurricanes, which reportedly featured a five-year offer worth $1.1 million per year. That contract would have vastly surpassed Amaker’s yearly salary at Harvard, the booster said.
“I think Tommy was looking for a reason to stay, and it just helped justify it in his mind that this was the right place for him,” the booster said.
Last year, when signing a multi-year extension on his contract with Harvard, Amaker had presented the school with a set of changes to be delivered over time, including work on the Lavietes Pavilion locker rooms, which was completed last summer.
And with overtures from Miami, Amaker and his agent David B. Falk—best known for representing notable NBA clientele such as Michael Jordan—seized the chance to strengthen the coach’s negotiating position with the University.
“I do think part of this, meeting with [University of Miami] no doubt was a little posturing on his side to make sure this wish list of his was sort of accelerated,” the booster said.
On the list of his requests was a country club membership, first reported by Sports Illustrated writer Pablo S. Torre ’07, a former Crimson sports editor. It remains unclear whether the boosters will act to fulfill that request. But among the program’s supporters, Amaker’s wish list did not raise eyebrows.
“Everything he’s asked for is very, very reasonable," the booster said. “If it was unreasonable, I don’t think the Friends would step up and do it.”
A former head coach at Seton Hall and Michigan, Amaker’s name had been linked to an opening at Georgia Tech earlier this year, but the move to South Beach was the first potential offer that he was reported to be seriously considering. Amaker’s interest was surprising to some given the lack of cachet associated with the position at Miami as well as Amaker’s success at Harvard.
In four seasons with the Crimson, Amaker has led the program to a share of its first-ever Ivy championship and the two best seasons in school history. Harvard looks to be the heavy favorite to capture the top spot in the Ancient Eight next season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite an increase in concentrators, the number of faculty members in the Sociology Department has remained flat, and professors in the department—including Department Chair Mary C. Brinton, Orlando Patterson, Nicholas A. Christakis, and Christopher Winship—now say that they need at least three more faculty members to meet student demand.
With his department growing, Patterson called on the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to reevaluate its departmental priorities in an interview last Friday.
“Even if you have a fiscal constraint you can still prioritize in terms of where you put your money,” Patterson said in reference to FAS, which is currently trying to close a budget deficit of $35 million by 2012. “The University is still spending, it’s still hiring, and they’ll have to choose between departments that are declining and those that are increasing.”
During the past five years, the number of sociology concentrators has more than doubled—from 88 in 2006 to 202 in the current academic year. The number of undergraduates pursuing a secondary in sociology has jumped from 0 to 22 during that time.
Meanwhile, the number of faculty members has stayed relatively constant. Currently, there are 13 full-time faculty in the department and three professors who split their time between sociology and other departments.
“The big issue is—do we have sufficient faculty so we can offer an adequate number of junior tutorials, keep our classes from being too large, have enough faculty to supervise senior theses, and advise students?” Winship said. “It’s unusual to have sociology and psychology departments to be such a small fraction of the size of the economics and government departments.”
“The way we prevent our students from paying a price is that we just work hard, work harder. We’re overworked right now. We could’ve offered fewer courses, but that wouldn’t be right for the students,” Patterson said.
According to Patterson, the FAS’s reluctance to allocate more resources to the department is the result of “a lack of respect” on the part of administrators for the department.
“I don’t think they would do this to the Economics or science departments,” he said.
In addition, the department underwent an “embarrassing” situation two years ago, when it was forced to retract unofficial job offers to two professors, Patterson said.
The department had been authorized to fill two junior positions that year but was forced to rescind the offers, he said, because of budget constraints within the FAS, which were the result of the then-recent financial crisis.
In addition to its strained student-faculty ratio, the department took a hit this year when four of its senior faculty members took leaves of absences, including Robert J. Sampson, Michele Lamont, Frank Dobbin, and Bruce Western.
“This is Harvard—we ought to have a little bit of wiggle room. What happens is that it just overburdens the faculty who are here, and it’s not good for us,” Patterson said.
Aside from the serving the needs of a growing number of concentrators, Christakis said that the department would benefit from covering a wider spectrum of topics.
“One important issue is what kind of faculty do we need to cover important intellectual areas. In my opinion, we could really use someone who does the sociology of Islam, the sociology of environment, and biosociology,” he said.
Despite the faculty shortage, students in the department have given the department largely positive ratings. In the 2010 Senior Exit Survey, the concentration satisfaction ranking for sociology was significantly above the College mean.
The department has also topped national rankings in the field. A study conducted this year by the Chronicle of Higher Education ranked Harvard’s undergraduate and graduate programs number one in the nation.
In addition, according to Patterson, an outside committee that was sent to evaluate the department two years ago gave it “rave reviews,” surpassing the goals set by the previous evaluation. However, the committee also recommended the hiring of more faculty members.
“It’s not just an issue of student demand, but does Harvard want to maintain the quality of its undergraduate education,” Winship said.
But, according to Patterson, the University has yet to provide any indication that it will undertake an expansion of the department in the future.
“They’re just saying, ‘We understand your situation, you’re doing a great job, and we’ll think about it,’ and we never hear anything more,” Patterson said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WOBURN, Mass.—Defense attorney John A. Amabile said in court yesterday that he sees potential grounds for a mistrial in the case of accused Kirkland shooter Jabrai Jordan Copney because of an alleged conversation that took place Tuesday between his client and a witness in the case.
Copney and the witness, Blayn Jiggetts, were allegedly placed in the same prison transport and were able to speak to one another while they were being taken from court to jail.
John T. Lu, the presiding judge, has dismissed the jury until Friday while he considers the legal ramifications of the exchange between the two men.
Jiggetts—who made a plea deal with prosecutors in exchange for testifying against Copney—first took the stand Tuesday and was slated to continue when court opened yesterday.
State police interviewed Jiggetts outside of the courtroom yesterday about the alleged conversation in the van. Assistant District Attorney Daniel J. Bennett ’85 then presented a transcript of the 45-minute interview with Lu and Amabile.
“The problem with the conversation [in the van] is that it should never have occurred at all, because these two guys should not have been placed in a transportation together,” Amabile said.
In court, Amabile said that the incident might be sufficient cause to scrap the entire trial, which completed its eighth day yesterday.
“This is a disaster,” he said. “I think we should consider a mistrial at this point and start this thing all over again.”
Matthew H. Feinberg, who represents Aquino, said it was “unbelievable” that Copney and Jiggetts were driven in the same van.
Jiggetts pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter in September. In exchange for his testimony against Copney, prosecutors offered Jiggetts a promise of 9 to 12 years in jail, as opposed to the life sentence without parole which Copney faces if convicted of first-degree murder.
On Tuesday, Jiggetts told jurors that he, his longtime friend Jason Aquino, and Copney made plans to steal marijuana at gunpoint from Justin Cosby, the murder victim, and that Copney shot Cosby when the Cambridge resident refused to hand over the drugs.
Because his plea bargain is contingent on his testimony in Copney’s case, Jiggetts has not yet been sentenced.
During the testimony that did occur yesterday, Denise Cosby, the mother of the shooting victim, briefly took the stand.
“Justin was my baby boy,” she said. “He was a mama’s boy. He had a heart of gold.”
While questioning the forensic pathologist who conducted Cosby’s autopsy, Bennett displayed an up-close photograph of the bullet wound in Cosby’s abdomen. Before allowing Bennett to show the image, Lu cautioned jurors that the picture was “gruesome” and that they must not allow their judgement to be swayed by “emotion, passion, prejudice, or sympathy.”
Lu also considered a motion by Amabile regarding the fact that Aquino, who like Jiggetts has pleaded guilty to manslaughter, is not expected to testify in Copney’s trial.
Amabile had requested that Lu give a special instruction to jurors at the conclusion of the case which would authorize them to consider Aquino’s absence as an indication that his testimony—had it been given—would have been unfavorable to the prosecution.
Lu denied the defense’s request, ruling that because Aquino has chosen to utilize his Fifth Amendment right not to testify in a matter in which he could incriminate himself, Aquino is unavailable as a witness.

From Brussels to Cambridge—two entrepreneurs plan to bring made-to-order Belgian waffles to Harvard Square by July 1 with the opening of Zinneken’s at 1154 Mass. Ave.
Co-founders—Bertrand Lempkowicz and Nhon T. Ma—obtained a Common Victualer License after a hearing in front of the Cambridge License Commission on Tuesday. With this permit and another food service license that the men have yet to obtain, they will be able to open a restaurant that does not serve alcohol.
The bakery will serve sweet waffles, which Ma described as “fluffy” and different from American varieties. The waffles are textured with melted pearl sugar drops—one of the many ingredients Ma will import from Belgium because they are not widely available in the United States.
The waffles will feature a variety of toppings, including fruit, whipped cream, Belgian chocolate, Nutella, and imported syrup, Ma said.
In addition, the bakery will sell another, crunchier type of waffle and Belgian chocolate.
According to Ma, in Belgium, people usually eat the waffles as a take-away snack. Zinneken’s will be open from 7:30 a.m. to 12 a.m. daily.
Zinneken’s will open in the former location of Arrow Street Crepes, above Berryline at the intersection of Mass. Ave. and Arrow Street.
The restaurant will have limited seating, with around 19 seats. Ma said he believes the small space will help create a “cozy European environment.”
“We’re trying to bring a real Belgian experience. We’ll serve the waffles as they are served on the streets in Brussels,” Ma said.
Zinneken’s has joined the Harvard Square Business Association, and the founders have been searching for a location since last summer, according to business association executive director Denise A. Jillson.
“They’re doing a good job creating a very charming Belgian waffle eatery. It will serve very authentic Belgian waffles,” Jillson said.
Ma said he is excited to introduce a new restaurant to the Boston area. Originally from Belgium, Lempkowicz and Ma have been traveling back and forth from Brussels to Boston since 2004, and recently began to do market research for the restaurant.
Ma said he sees Harvard Square as a vibrant community for whom his product will be appealing.
“We’re taking a risk in bringing a new product on the market, but I think it will appeal to the students and the tourists in Harvard Square. There’s nothing like it,” he said.

The grilled chicken in the dining hall looked unusually dry last night.
Luckily, Maya E. Peña ’12 was just the right person to give it some life. After poaching the chicken in a mix of orange juice, water, and stock, Peña coated it with a glaze of honey, mustard, olive oil, and curry powder “to make it juicier,” she said.
Meanwhile, Peña’s teammate Lauren N. Medina ’12 grabbed a plastic cup and crushed a handful of Honey Graham Squares cereal in a bowl. She then scooped in a dollop of butter and brown sugar to create the perfect crust for her cheesecake dessert.
Adams residents Peña and Medina were crowned Top Chef Harvard for their dishes “Orange Poached Chicken” and “No Bake Cheesecake” at the third annual competition at Annenberg Hall last night.
The winners from each upperclassman House and Annenberg competed in the finale. The participants, dressed in tall chef hats and white aprons, were slicing kiwis, stripping chicken pieces, and squeezing lemons as they rushed to create one entrée and dessert per team in 30 minutes using only the ingredients available in the dining hall.
While Peña prepared butternut squash puree and fresh green salad with beans and cranberries, Medina whipped a mixture of cream cheese, lemon, sugar, and butter for the cheesecake.
On the table next to Team Adams, a freshman team of Madalyn S. Bates ’14 and My Nogc C. To ’14 fused different cultural cuisines to create “Fruit Sushi” and “Vietnamese Stuffed Bread Rolls.” Bates’ dessert was made with banana, apple, and kiwi slices rolled up in flattened pieces of white bread with grape jam and cream cheese. To created Vietnamese bread rolls stuffed with grilled chicken marinated in soy sauce, peanut butter, and milk.
“Students can take break from their studies and do something that’s fun and exciting,” said guest judge David P. Davidson, Harvard University Hospitality and Dining Services’ Director of Operations, in an interview before tasting the dishes.
Within 30 minutes of cooking, these aspiring chefs whipped up creative dishes ranging from pasta with peanut butter sauce to chicken quesadillas to key lime pie.
“I can taste the influence of different cultures,” said guest judge Rudolf Gautschi, HUHDS Director for Residential Dining.
Team Mather’s Elena-Madalina Persu ’13 and Joanna F. Behrman ’13 concocted a vegetarian meal: an Italian twist on a grilled cheese sandwich made with local tomatoes and mozzarella cheese and an orange peel stuffed with cinnamon, raisins, honey, and banana.
“We made comfort food—nothing enormously complicated—using the ingredients you can always find and make anytime,” Behrman said.
Team Cabot’s Carolyn S. M. Stein ’13 and Anna C. Mapes ’13, the defending champions, made curry cumin tuna salad with dried cranberries in a toasted pita shell and butternut squash apple crisp.
“I like to use spices, which tend to elevate the food from the typical dining hall food,” Stein said.
The dishes were evaluated on presentation, taste, creativity and sustainability.
In the end, Team Adams won the title, along with an assortment of kitchen utensils and a jar of chocolate sauce. Team Cabot won second place.
“We didn’t expect to win, especially after looking at everyone’s food,” Medina said. “People came up with really inventive dishes.”
Medina’s “No Bake Cheesecake” will become a part of the HUHDS’ regular menu.
The duo already has a plan to enter next year’s competition.
“We gotta defend the title next year,” Peña said.

Comedian Julie Goldman discussed her Jewish family, lesbian identity, and self-proclaimed butchness at a “Laughter and Lezzing Out” event organized yesterday by GirlSpot, a queer women’s group.
The self-described “butch lez” Boston native addressed a group of sixty students from Harvard and other schools in an interactive presentation. Goldman gave the audience members nicknames and inquired about the relationship statuses and stories of the largely queer audience.
“You never made out with your straight friend?” Goldman asked one of three audience members who identified herself as heterosexual.
“Not that one,” she replied.
Though the event was called “Laughter and Lezzing Out,” GirlSpot co-chair Elizabeth C. Elrod ’11 said that someone doesn’t need to be a lesbian to “lez out.”
“It is just hanging out with a bunch of friends and acting like a huge lesbian, appreciating your body, appreciating gayness and being who you are with everyone else and making fun of stereotypes,” she said.
Goldman, who eschews political correctness, took on stereotypes ranging from her Jewish mother to lesbian bra shopping.
“You gotta get fitted for a bra, because otherwise everything just gets longer,” Goldman told the audience.
She described her experience being “Lezzilla” while shopping for bras at Victoria’s Secret. As someone who doesn’t conform to traditional standards of femininity, Goldman was looking for bras with superheroes rather than flowers—something that audience member and Kirkland House tutor Laure E. “Voop” de Vulpillieres ’02 agreed with.
Vulpillieres—who earned the nickname “B-O-I” from Goldman because of her gender-bending appearance—said she appreciated Goldman use of humor to “bring out the real challenge of trying to navigate the murky line between not wanting to be a girl and not wanting to be trans either, trying to fit somewhere in between.”
She asked a follow up question on where to buy a bra with a Superman print.
The show wrapped up with Goldman tackling the issue of marriage equality like what she called “a real lesbian folk rocker” with a song about marriage equality.
Audience members were also the first to find out that Goldman had just landed a guest role on the television show Bones, playing a “playing a mannish lesbian bowling player who hits on Bones.”
Many noted Goldman’s butch gender presentation as an important aspect of the event.
“I think it’s so great that the queer community at Harvard is giving a space for discussion of the experiences of those outside the mainstream,” said James R. Sares ’12.
Elrod agreed. “There are always other aspects within the queer community, a lesbian is not just one form,” she said. “This is part of our initiative to make Harvard gayer. I like to lez out, and invite 600 of my closest Facebook friends.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last season, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team defeated Holy Cross, 15-9, extending its winning streak against the Crusaders to six games.
Last night, the Crimson (6-4. 3-1 Ivy) kept the streak going, beating Holy Cross (5-10, 2-2 Patriot), 10-6, at Holy Cross Field.
“I think that today we came out and we played well,” said sophomore midfielder Danielle Tetreault who finished the night with three goals and an assist. “They were a good defensive team and controlled the ball well, but we came up with some draw controls and had possession for most of the game which really helped us because if you have possession you can score goals. We kind of dominated that side of the field.”
After taking an early 2-0 lead, Harvard never looked back, outscoring the Crusaders, 5-3, in each of the halves.
“Taking an early lead is really important,” Tetreault said. “It’s something we’ve been striving for because it’s that kind of quick start that really helps. We don’t want to be coming from behind every game.  We want to be able to play throughout the whole game and not let an opponent get away from us.”
Harvard gained its first goal barely three minutes into the game, when sophomore attacker Jennifer VanderMeulen scored off of a free-position shot.
Four and a half minutes later, junior midfielder Tyler Petropulos followed her teammate’s lead and scored another unassisted goal for the Crimson to put the team up by two.
But Harvard had difficulty pulling away with the lead as the Crusaders battled back thanks to a trio of scores—including one from Maddie Carrellas who led Holy Cross with a pair of goals.
“We knew that they were going to be a pretty decent team and we prepared in practice for them, but their style of play was just something we had to adjust to,“ freshman Chelsey Newman said.
Despite the home team’s rally the Crimson went into the break with an 18-5 shot advantage and a 5-3 lead, thanks to a late score from VanderMeulen with 13 seconds left to the half.
Coming out of halftime, VanderMeulen kept the visitor’s momentum alive, scoring the half’s first goal and her third of the night.
The Crusaders made an attempt at a comeback, putting up two scores over the next 12 minutes of play and cutting their deficit to a single goal.
But this was the closest Holy Cross would come to the lead.
With 10:15 left in the matchup, Newman finished an unassisted goal to put Harvard up again by two. And two minutes later, Tetreault found the back of the net off a Petropulos feed, bringing the score to 8-5.
The Crusaders scored once more in the final eight minutes of the game, but it wasn’t enough to stop the Crimson which scored twice more in the match.
VanderMeulen assisted Tetreault on her third goal of the night, and with only 13 seconds remaining, Petropulos scored one last time to lead Harvard to a 10-6 victory.
The Crimson ended the night outshooting Holy Cross, 30-22, and with eight turnovers compared to the Crusaders’ 15.
Though the Harvard defense lost the battle in saves, 11-7, it ended the night without allowing Holy Cross’s leading scorer, Kat Sutton, to find the net once, putting a stop to her 43-game scoring streak.
Despite the win and defensive achievement, the Crimson felt it could have come out stronger.
“Holy Cross is a good team,” tri-captain Sam McMahon said. “But we eased our way in, and didn’t really have that much energy. We needed to pick that up in the second half, and we were just kind of slow to start and made some turnovers. Still, in the end, we focused and got the job done.”
“I think we weren’t really ready for the type of game they were playing but I think we adjusted well and still came out with a win,” Newman added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’ve had the pleasure of attending some phenomenal sporting events this year. I saw Harvard hold on to beat Yale in The Game. I watched the men’s hockey team’s crazy victory over Boston University at the Beanpot, which helped spur a late-season resurrection. And I witnessed history when Harvard topped Princeton in basketball to earn a share of the Ivy League title.
These contests all had their share of drama, their share of those unbeatable, ecstatic, I-believe-that-we-just-won moments.
But in terms of importance to its fans and long-term repercussions, those three matchups don’t compare to the Harvard v. Haiti game I saw on Sunday.
Just ask Rose Charles, a native Haitian who works as the volunteer coordinator and teaches English at the Association of Haitian Women of Boston.
“My voice is not the same, and it’s been what, since Sunday?” a very hoarse Rose Charles told me yesterday. She giggled. “That shows you how much noise and how much screaming and laughing happened while I was there.”
It wasn’t only Charles who cared about this game. Boston’s Haitian community came out in tremendous numbers. Over 11,000 fans attended Sunday night’s contest, many of whom were Haitian. As of 2005, there were just 40,000 Haitians in the entire state of Massachusetts.
“Haitian people: we love soccer,” Charles muses.
But more than a love of “the beautiful game” drove so many fans to Harvard Stadium on Sunday night. At its core, the event was a fundraiser to benefit both the Haiti National Team and Partners in Health’s (PIH) relief efforts in Haiti. Specifically, PIH plans to put the funds towards the construction of a teaching hospital in Mirebalais.
This had special importance to Charles, who grew up in Mirebalais.
“I was thanking people for going to the game,” Charles recalls. “That’s my city that they’re building [a hospital in].”
And of course, it’s not every day that the U-23 national team plays in your backyard, especially when a 7.0 earthquake rocked the very roots of the nation just a year earlier.
In fact, at least 30 people involved with Haiti soccer perished in the earthquake, including players, referees, and coaches.  Due in large part to this devastation, the team has dropped 33 places in the FIFA rankings in just over three years.
In a sense, the fact that the contest even took place was a victory.
“It meant a lot to us that we’re still standing,” Charles says. “The theme [of the day] was ‘Ayiti leve’ [which means] we’re still standing [or] we’re still working.”
The game was more than just a game. It was a fundraiser and, above all, a celebration.
“I saw a lot of people I hadn’t seen in years, and I’m sure it was the same for a lot of people who went there,” Charles says. “I…saw the church pastor there with some members of the church. And I was like, ‘Wow, that’s awesome.’”
So when I walked into Harvard Stadium, I was greeted not by the usual ho-hum of Harvard students but rather by the pulsating singing and screaming and dancing and drum-banging of the Haitian fans.
Finally, after hours of tailgating and many more hours if not days of anticipation, the Haitian fans finally settled into their seats, and Harvard v. Haiti game began.
At some point, surrounded by Haitian fans, I began to feel myself cheering for the visitors. Heck, how could you not? This was a team that really shouldn’t have been there in the first place and very well could’ve ceased to exist after the earthquake. This was a nation whose GDP is less than half of Harvard’s endowment.
I’m not sure there is a bigger David.
At first, Haiti held the clear edge, thanks to superior ball-handling skills. But the team failed to find the back of the net. As the game went on, it became clear that neither side held the advantage. A stalemate reigned.
But despite the mediocre, rather unexciting soccer that developed, the enthusiasm of the more than 11,000 fans never waned. They cheered at every slick move by a Haitian player, jumped to their feet when a goal appeared in reach, and jeered when the referee gave out the yellow and red cards. These people were living and dying with this team, their team.
Eventually, the 90 minutes of regulation came to an unexciting 0-0 finish. The teams duked it out in penalty kicks, and Haiti finally pulled ahead, beating Harvard, 4-1. The fans, naturally, went berserk.
Even for those who didn’t witness the rather unexpected penalty kicks, regulation in itself was thrilling enough.
“It was crazy,” says Charles. “[A friend and I] also called our [friend] in Haiti…[and] both were screaming, telling him how much he missed for not being here.”
From here, the Haiti national team has big aspirations to say the least. According to the Boston Globe, the squad has one main goal: to qualify for the World Cup in 2014.
But at this point, the team has done more than enough.
Because like the nation, the team is still standing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When junior Nick Farnsworth began throwing the javelin during his freshman year of high school, no one could have known how far he would go—with the sport or with the spear. But as he climbs the ranks among the all-time best at Harvard, he’s proving to be one of the best in the country and, perhaps eventually, in the world.
Tired of baseball, a young Farnsworth decided to put his strong arm to use, trying all of the track and field throwing events until he settled on the javelin.
Coincidence? Probably not. The sport was in his blood. Nick’s father, David Farnsworth, holds the third spot on Penn’s all-time list, with a distance of 67.32 meters.
“My father was a great javelin thrower, but there was never any pressure for me to do track or throw the javelin,” Farnsworth said. “I ended up choosing to do it on my own, but the support of my dad and the rest of my family made it a lot easier to continue training for an event that I wasn’t great at from the start.”
Farnsworth began his career as the third-best thrower on his high school team, but stuck with the sport. By his junior year he was the best in the state of Massachusetts, making him an attractive candidate for recruitment.
“He not only was a great talent, but we were incredibly impressed by his work ethic and passion for the sport,” Crimson coach Jason Saretsky explained.
But the recruitment process that brought Farnsworth to Harvard was anything but simple.
With impressive academics and the javelin, Farnsworth had his choice of top tier universities, but didn’t immediately hear from Harvard.
So as summer turned into the fall of his senior year, the thrower took initiative and reached out to Saretsky. In conversations with the coach, Farnsworth found out that the Crimson staff had attempted to get in touch with him, but that his high school neglected to tell him about the letters.
Despite the miscue, once Saretsky and Farnsworth were matched, the decision was easy for the Wilmington, Mass., native.
“I arranged an official visit and came to campus to see what Harvard was really like,” Farnsworth explained. “At the time my top school was Brown, but after the visit I committed to Harvard...I got my likely letter a few months later.”
By the conclusion of his senior year, Farnsworth had thrown 58.62 meters, breaking the Massachusetts state record and solidifying himself as a top javelin thrower. But injury threatened to put a curveball into his entire throwing career.
During his junior year of high school, Farnsworth blew out his elbow, tearing his ulnar collateral ligament (UCL). He went to a doctor, but the tear went undiagnosed.
“I threw in pain for the remainder of my high school career and into my college years,” Farnsworth said. “I had to cut every year short, because the pain in my arm would get worse during the end of the year and I wouldn’t throw as far as I could.”
But after only his first meet with Harvard, coaches sensed that there was a problem with his arm and sent him to get another set of MRIs. The scans confirmed that he tore his UCL years ago.
The treatment plan, including a Tommy John surgery followed by a year and a half of extensive rehabilitation, forced Farnsworth to redshirt.
“Nick had to sit out his sophomore season,” co-captain Ablorde Ashigbi said. “But he still spent more time than anyone else at the track throughout that year, using his injury as an opportunity to improve other aspects of his athleticism and strength.”
This year marks Farnsworth’s first of healthy throwing. Based on his season so far, highlighted by a win this past weekend at Ole Miss and a huge victory at Rice where he threw his personal best, 64.65 meters, it appears that surgery was the right choice.
“It was a great meet overall, but it felt good to be able to go out and really compete for the first time since recovery,” Farnsworth said. “I was just happy to throw without pain and to actually enjoy throwing again.”
The accomplishment bumped him up from fifth in Harvard history, with his previous best of 61.43, to the No. 3 spot.
As Farnsworth improves, he inches closer to his ultimate goal, qualifying for the Olympic Trials next summer and, eventually, making the Olympic Team. He knows that this is a substantial undertaking, but coaches and teammates alike confirm that Farnsworth is capable.
“He definitely has a future in the javelin,” Ashigbi said. “He is, without a doubt, the most dedicated athlete I’ve met during my time here. He almost lives at the track and does everything he possibly can—that’s legal—to be the best javelin thrower he can.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite fielding more varsity programs than any other school in the nation, the Harvard Department of Athletics had the second-lowest expenses of any Ivy League school last year, according to figures released by the U.S. Department of Education Office of Postsecondary Education.
The Department of Athletics spent just under $18 million to support its teams, according to the OPE’s report, which makes public an overview of the Athletic Department’s financial information between July 1, 2009, and June 30, 2010.
The data, released in accordance with a 1994 piece of Title IX legislation called the Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act, includes the number of participants in varsity programs, recruiting costs, and average salaries for coaches.
According to the report, Yale outspent other Ivy League athletic departments with a total budget of about $36 million. Brown spent the lowest among the Ancient Eight, spending a little more than $15 million.
That school is currently considering reducing its number of varsity sports programs, according to the Brown Daily Herald.
At Harvard, the Athletics Department spent $257,000 on the football team, more than any other single-sex team. The University covered $438,050 in expenses for both men’s and women’s crew programs according to the report, more than any other sport in the Department.
Harvard’s 35 head coaches earned an average of $77,657 last year. According to the report, head coaches for men’s teams make, on average, $21,000 more per year than coaches for women’s teams. Head coaches for men’s squads earned an average of $87,901 last year, and their counterparts on women’s teams earned an average of $66,811.
The same discrepancy exists among assistant coaches, though the difference is not as great. The average assistant coach on a men’s team earns $38,751. On women’s teams, their equivalent coaches make an average of $30,197.
Five of the 43 assistant coaches on men’s teams at Harvard are female, according to the OPE. No head coach on a men’s team is female, though women very rarely coach men’s teams across the NCAA. The report does not break down its coach compensation information sport-by-sport.
Football and men’s basketball are the only two sports with multiple full-time assistant coaches at Harvard. But the two sports are the largest college sports by a wide margin—both in terms of fan support and the money that they draw—and the larger coaching staff is consistent with popular NCAA practice.
A number of other teams have multiple assistant coaches that work on a part-time basis, the report indicates.
Another major athletic expenditure, according to the OPE, are recruiting costs. Harvard spent about $860,000 on recruiting in 2009-10, including $633,453 for men’s teams and $225,912 for women’s teams.
Harvard’s recruiting costs are the third highest of any Ivy program. Only Princeton and Columbia spend more, and the latter program is the only one in the Ancient Eight to spend over $1 million on recruiting.
Despite spending nearly $20 million on its teams annually, funding from Harvard’s Department of Athletics does not cover individual programs’ entire costs, according to softball coach Jenny Allard.
For instance, Harvard only covers travel costs for the softball program in the Northeast, Allard said in an interview earlier this year. But the team must seek out alternative funding for its pre-season roadtrips.
“[These trips are] the thing that we have to fundraise for, do clinics for, [and] solicit donations [for], and those are the things where we look [to] save money,” she said.
While she did not offer the budgetary breakdown, she said that the team draws financial supports from its “friends group.” Most Harvard programs have similar groups, largely comprising alumni who help fund various efforts and activities.
She added that the softball program fundraises during its roadtrips. While the team does what it can to save, she said the funding from the Athletics Department is crucial.
“There is no way we would tolerate not being able to be a competitive team in the Northeast region,” she said.
Director of Athletics Robert L. Scalise did not return requests for comment on the OPE report or on the financial direction of the department.

When high school senior Grace E. Oberhofer found out she was waitlisted two weeks ago, she did what we all wished we had the guts to do in order to give her application a boost: she wrote a song to Harvard and posted it on YouTube.
In a video appropriately titled "Dear Harvard," which has reached more than 5,000 views in five days, Oberhofer, clad in a Harvard beanie and Harry Potter glasses, plays the piano and sings about classic Harvardisms, from the Russian Bells to Primal Scream.
"On John Harvard's statue I'd never pee/Harvard I utter my primal scream," Oberhofer promises. "Let me in to your community/Harvard please admit/Me!"
Oberhofer said she was admitted to six of the 12 schools to which she applied—including Brandeis, Duke, Tufts, and Tulane. But when she found out she was waitlisted at her father's alma mater, she saw that Harvard just seemed more attainable. (Her father, a 1978 graduate who lived in Lowell House, helped her with some of the song references.)
A music and songwriting student at the Tacoma School of the Arts in Tacoma, Wash. Oberhofer said this video is "satirical," "over the top," and just a way to show her sense of humor.
We told her that another school may find her musical twist to the admissions process a bit more fitting.
This post has been revised to reflect the following the corrections:
CORRECTION: April 16, 2011
An earlier version of the April 14 Flyby post "Waitlisted Senior Sings to Harvard To Admit Her" misidentified Grace E. Oberhofer's high school. In fact, Oberhofer attends Tacoma School of the Arts.

Equipped with panda ears, guitar and boombox, FM dougied as The White Panda all over campus, going incognito as the musical duo, and finding out what people really think of Yardfest. Here is what we discovered.
1. FM: Are you ready for Yardfest?
Eliza: I went last year, and it was a really cool idea in principle, but the weather was kind of bad … and there weren’t that many people, but it’s Prefrosh weekend this year, so I think there will be a lot more people.
Kenneth: So for the past three years I’ve been involved in the organization of the event, so this year I get to enjoy it from the senior side. It’s exciting to see everyone do such a good job.
Cerianne: [Last year] My assassin was there in Mower assasins … I spent the entire time looking over my shoulder.
2. Which two songs would you mash-up a la The White Panda?
Kenneth: Pursuit of Happiness as a throwback to last year with Kid Cudi and Afraid of Everyone by The National.
Eliza: I’m a massive country fan, it’s basically all I listen to … so probably a bit of Taylor Swift, Carrie Underwood and maybe Brad Paisley.
Cerianne: Honestly you could mix Taylor Swift songs and you wouldn’t be able to tell they were mixed.
Alex: Thunder and Macarena (does Macarena).
Kyle: A Thousand Miles and Lose Yourself.
3. Tell us what you know about pandas:
Alex: They need to show them pornography, biologically they do not want to reproduce … pandas cannot get it off. Pandas have problems reproducing because they have no libido (awkward silence). It’s true!
Kyle: Little pandas sneeze loudly.

The only thing better than free ice cream? Two forms of free ice cream. Today, you can try complimentary milk shakes and scoops as two Harvard Square businesses duke it out to see who makes the best frozen sweet.
Ben and Jerry's ice cream truck will combat Harvey, b.good's whimsically named shake-making vehicle, during the event, which has been named the "Ice Cream Truck Battle." The contest will take place from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. today on Dunster Street, the border zone between the two feuding sweet shops.
The event is sponsored by the Burger Brigade, a crew of students from Harvard and other local universities who plan to run the Boston Marathon dressed in burger and French fry costumes to raise money for the nonprofit organization Back On My Feet.
Today, both trucks will ask for donations to the charity, which promotes running as a means of empowering the homeless. The vehicle which takes in the most money will be named the ice cream truck champion. The real winner, of course, will be the charitable beneficiary—and you.

Harvard has a habit of being near the top of many rankings. "U.S. News & World Report" routinely deems the College among the best in the world, and the Medical School and the Business School usually grace the top three spots as well.
Harvard earned another distinction yesterday,  but this one was not quite as enviable.
The Daily Beast ranked Harvard third in its listing of "2011's Most Stressful Colleges," bumping Harvard up two spots from last year's lackluster fifth place finish. Only Columbia and Stanford beat the College this time around, while Cambridge neighbor MIT finished seventh in the standings.
To create this list, The Daily Beast looked at several statistics but did not poll students who attend the universities. The school's cost of tuition plus room and board (not taking into account financial aid), the college's acceptance rate, the local crime rate, and the rigor of the university’s engineering program accounted for 65 percent of each school's stress score.
Caltech, a notoriously stressful school, didn't even crack the top 10, and Washington University in St. Louis finished fifth largely due to the city of St. Louis' high crime rate.
This all begs the question: with a hefty sticker price, a low acceptance rate, and a high crime rate, where was Yale? Our New   Haven counterpart finished tenth, behind Vanderbilt (eighth) and Northwestern (ninth).
