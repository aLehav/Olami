After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The title of Alana Massey’s 15-essay collection, “All the Lives I Want,” appears in gold glitter on an otherwise white cover. Though discussing a book’s cover is usually a professional no-go, the exterior of “All the Lives I Want”—strategically, one suspects—immediately raises questions of gendered snap judgments and what can be “taken seriously,” questions painfully pertinent to an essay collection based on female celebrities, real and fictitious. Adventurous title fonts in non-black, navy, or gray colors evoke female celebrities’ memoirs, romance novels, and beach reads, and female authors of what would be considered “serious literature” have fought the “feminization” of their book covers as one more machination belittling women’s writing. With a combination of personal memoir and incisive, wide-ranging analyses of pop culture from the 90s to the present day, “All the Lives I Want” shows us that the scare quotes are inane.
“All the Lives I Want” features 25 female celebrities—real and imaginary, ranging from Princess Diana to Regan MacNeil  in “The Exorcist”—whose lives Massey does not necessarily want, but that have all revealed some truth about her life and ours. The collection deals most overtly with themes of gender, providing insight into the social and cultural forces that have shaped the lives of American women over these past few decades.
Massey covers an impressive range of topics that notably encompasses race and socioeconomic status. These are not mere token gestures: Massey shows us how concerns are universal. In “American Pain: The Suffering-Class Spectacle of Anna Nicole Smith,” for example, she astutely dissects E. Pierce Marshall, son of model Anna Nicole Smith’s 89-year-old millionaire husband. Despite being outrageously wealthy, Marshall remained hell-bent on preventing Anna from inheriting any of his father’s money. Marshall is “the American Dream made sickly by its own hubris…. America’s disgrace”—a figure who pollutes and sways all of our American dreams, no matter how remote from our experiences the life of his stripper-turned-celebrity stepmother may seem. As Massey writes: “[Entertainment channels], alongside their more erudite cousins in the form of high-end profiles and interviews, have produced a new kind of American mythology wherein celebrities serve as our national heroes instead of the patriots or politicians of yesteryear.” Though the “serious literature” establishment may not hold celebrity culture in high regard, our collective choice about whom to regard as national figures is undoubtedly serious business.
Concepts such as intersectionality would not emerge so naturally from, say, 19th-century British literature. Massey’s style embodies key aspects of the millennial American voice—tones of personal experience, prose, and the identity consciousness unique to the Internet’s generation. Massey resourcefully navigates the Internet, television, and publications, bringing depth and breadth of knowledge about the women of whom she writes, and the culture that makes them who we think they are. Her writing is loaded with statements that cut to the heart of cultural norms. As she discusses Sylvia Plath’s condemnation as overly confessional, for example, Massey refers to Knausgaard’s “My Struggle” as “a six-volume gaze at a Norwegian man’s navel.” She generally strikes a well-tuned balance between the Internet’s personal, informal tone and more traditional diction and structure.
There are, admittedly, bits in “All the Lives I Want” that feel like misplaced fragments of blogs and Buzzfeed: a description of Goodreads, biographical information about a friend, a vignette from a relationship, some other extended personal detail. They are relatively innocuous and never egregiously irrelevant. The essays’ forms, however, are unforgiving enough that a straying paragraph distinguishes between the more immediately powerful and cohesive pieces and the ones that require another read to parse their claims. Among the punchiest first-read standouts are “American Pain,” “There Can Only Be One: On Lil’ Kim, Nicki Minaj, and the Art of the Manufactured Beef,” and “Long-Game Bitches: On Princess Di, Lisa ‘Left Eye’ Lopes, and the Fine Art of Crazy Exing,” all three of which are mostly devoid of cameos from Massey’s personal life.
But Massey’s awareness of herself, and the way she uses the personal to reframe our world, is also her key strength. In the first essay, for example, she wryly notes that self-identifying as a “Winona” or a “Gwyneth” is a choice between “white women who are conventionally attractive,” a demographic to which Massey arguably belongs. That she was a stripper, that she went to divinity school, that she struggles with body image: In certain literary traditions such details should be used far more sparingly than Massey chooses to, but in forcefully acknowledging her formative traits and paradigms rather than trying to divest herself of them—impossible, really, given the genre—she challenges readers to examine their own biases and circumstances. As we encounter points to which we react strongly, we begin to feel that we can hear Massey responding, or suddenly understand which unnoted characteristics of our own lives may have led us to adopt our stance. Regardless of how much anyone thinks personal events should or should not saturate a person’s writing, this element of vulnerability and openness renders Massey’s essays compelling long after they end.
The collection’s title comes from a Sylvia Plath passage in which Plath laments all the things she will never be able to do. Plath, of course, appears as one of collection’s celebrities, commanding its lengthy title essay “All the Lives I Want: Recovering Sylvia Plath.” In it, Massey recalls discovering Plath’s work in her late twenties, while she was “on a mission to make the emotions of young women not just visible in the literary world but to make them essential components of it.” Massey does not say whether this is still a mission of hers, but its spirit seems present and mature throughout her essays. “All the Lives I Want” cuts at barriers that delineate what can be “taken seriously,” stand between “female” and “good,” and quarantine the personal from the publishable. It champions a cause whose life Plath would very likely have wanted to live.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Bombs, electronics, cartoon characters, and sushi: This is what the word “Japan” has meant to most of America for the past 70 years. Our conception of the country has shifted from former WWII enemy to exotic vacation spot; what little knowledge we have of it is gleaned from adventurous tourists, who bring back tales of Harajuku girls and magical toilets. This past summer, I decided to explore a side of Japan hitherto unknown to me: Japanese artisans, or “shokunin” and the philosophies shaping their art.

Dedegumo
In Kyoto, there is no separation between “past” and “present”; ancient temples touch shoulders with glossy department stores, and the streets below are crowded with over-excited tourists, many of whom have rented traditional kimonos to wear for the day. History and modernity are one, and in a little corner where they meet, the street leads into an ordinary-looking shop that sells, of all things, timepieces.
“We are dedicated to admiring the history, culture, and nature of Kyoto. They inspire the ideas for our creations.”



“We also create innovative and modern designs that give our products an incomparable style like no other.”

“For every precious moment, we, the staff at Dedegumo, continue to make beautifully handcrafted works of art.”
Quotes taken from the Dedegumo company website.

This piece was a result of an innovative, intellectual, and far-reaching journalistic experiment: 10 foreign student journalists, invited by the Prime Minister’s office and hosted by HLAB, sought to explore and illuminate Japan over a span of 19 days. Encouraged to pursue whatever topic they found interesting while participating in various activities of HLAB or while exploring various cities in Japan on their own, the journalists’ work eventually spanned topics ranging from Japanese views of success and failure to the robust Japanese artisan culture. See some of the other pieces.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After trailing at halftime in seven of its first eight Ivy League contests, the Harvard men’s basketball team has apparently gotten sick of staging dramatic second half comebacks. Holding a double-digit lead at the break for the second night in a row, the Crimson held on to beat Cornell, 87-75, on Saturday night at Lavietes Pavilion.
Twenty-four hours after Harvard saw a 16-point halftime lead transform into a one-point deficit late in the second half against Columbia, the Crimson (16-7, 8-2 Ivy League) did not let its 20-point intermission edge over the Big Red (7-18, 3-7) shrink to single digits in the second half. Freshmen Seth Towns and Bryce Aiken combined for 38 points as Harvard picked up its second consecutive weekend sweep and became one step closer to securing a berth in the inaugural Ivy League Tournament.
“I thought it was an outstanding team effort,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I thought the first half was a tremendous display of being unselfish and great pace and we played a lot of guys, we have to on the second night. I was just very pleased with how we shared the ball for the most part.”
Not to be outdone by the 46 points and 58.1 percent shooting clip it posted in the first half on Friday, the Crimson began the Cornell game by sinking 60 percent of its field goals en route to 48 points before the break. Aiken spearheaded the charge, connecting on his first three three-pointers while senior center Zena Edosomwan, who battled foul trouble on Friday, was perfect on his four field goals before the break.
After jumping out to a 19-8 lead that forced the Big Red to burn a timeout, Harvard saw its lead shrink to three in less than four minutes. After the teams traded baskets, the Crimson made a move that proved to be decisive right before the intermission. Harvard closed the half on a 13-2 run and made a lead that seemed to be settling in the seven-to-nine range reach 20.
The Crimson hit six of its eight shots in the four minutes and 21 seconds before halftime while holding Cornell to 1-for-4 shooting and forcing three Big Red turnovers. Aiken and Towns put an exclamation point on the run as the former hit a jumper with 53 seconds to play before finding his classmate for a deep three with six seconds showing on the clock.
“Everyone was being super unselfish and we were really locked in defensively,” Edosomwan said. “A big staple of us the past couple of years, obviously our number one identity is defense, it was kind of nice to kind of get back to that and I think it was telling and showing in that run.”
The 48 points were the most that Harvard has posted in a first half this season while the 20-point margin going into the locker room was the team’s largest since holding a 22-point halftime lead over Fisher in November. Throughout the season, Amaker has mentioned the high degree to which his team relies on three-pointers. In the first half against Columbia on Friday, Harvard made just two but still found itself up 16. In the first half on Saturday, Amaker may have gotten the balance he was looking for—18 of his team’s 48 points came off of threes, 24 were from twos, and six came via free throws. Seven of the nine players who saw the floor in the first half chipped in a field goal before the break.
“We had stretches where [it was] about as well as we’ve played—last night and tonight—in stretches in the first half,” Amaker said. “It’s been hard for us to sustain that kind of play and teams have been able to work their way back into games against us.”
As has been the story for most of the season, one half looked drastically different from the other. This time around, the fourth quarter of the weekend proved to be a tough one for the Crimson. The second half was not pretty by any stretch of the imagination but the 20-point halftime lead proved to be enough. Cornell rode a 13-1 run after the Harvard lead reached 23, but the deficit would not get back under 10 in the second half.
Pace was a key for the Crimson in the first half, but it struggled to establish the same rhythm after the break. Harvard scored 18 points off of six Big Red turnovers through 20 minutes, but Cornell’s halftime adjustments allowed the visitors to take better shots and get to the free throw line with greater frequency as the game wore on.
“We like to run,” Aiken said. “We like to get out, run, score, that’s definitely a strong part of our game. It’s important to get those rebounds, get out and run. That definitely plays to our advantage and we like doing it.”
The Big Red got to the charity stripe 20 times on the evening, with 16 of the attempts coming after intermission, and made every one of its free throws. Cornell also shot 48 percent from the field in the second half and hit five three-pointers.
“Definitely want to improve on playing a full 40 minutes,” Aiken said. “There’s times throughout the game where we feel like we’re a tremendous team, a force to be reckoned with, and then there’s times where we slack and I think that’s what we have to work on. As soon as we put that 40 minutes together I think that we’ll be in good condition.”
The large discrepancy between halves is nothing new for this year’s Crimson team. All but two of Harvard’s 23 games this season have featured a double-digit lead by at least one of the two teams. The Crimson has not won both halves of a game since beating Dartmouth on Jan. 7.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In what was perhaps its most complete game in conference to date, the Harvard men’s basketball team took a large and early lead against a visiting Cornell squad en route to an 87-75 win over the Big Red Saturday night at Lavietes Pavilion.
The Crimson (16-7, 8-2 Ivy), in a matchup largely reminiscent of its one just a night before against Columbia, let a lead as high as 23 drop to 10 late in the second frame. Despite the thinning lead, Harvard held on with strong free throw shooting  and some key shots courtesy of freshman Bryce Aiken and classmate Seth Towns, who finished the game with 21 points and six rebounds while Aiken added 17 and three assists.
Cornell (7-18, 3-7), for its part, struggled to create offense, shooting 43 percent from the field and 38 percent from deep while turning over the ball 12 times.
AN EVEN BETTER START
Coming off a night where Harvard tied its season high for first half points, the Crimson outdid its Friday night performance on Saturday. Harvard tallied a season high 48 first half points on 60 percent shooting from the field and 60 percent from deep.
Led by Aiken, who drained two back-to-back threes within a minute early in the half, the Crimson established its lead early on. Harvard connected on four of its first five threes and was up 19 to 8 just over six minutes into the game.
“Today we came out and we started well, the first half we played really well together, the ball was moving, it was contagious,” Aiken said. “We were shooting well, defending really well.”
While the Big Red kept within striking distance early on, the Crimson took off late in the half.
It began with a layup from freshman forward Chris Lewis. Next came a tip-in layup from classmate Justin Bassey. On the ensuing possession co-captain Siyani Chambers found a cutting Bassey for an emphatic dunk. All told, in a span of just over four minutes the Crimson went on a 15-3 run to close the half up 48-28–its second largest first half lead of the season.
The effort wasn’t reserved to offense as Harvard shut down Cornell on the other end. Through the first frame, the Big Red shot 39 percent from the field and 33 percent from deep. Of its 12 turnovers, eight came in the first half alone.
“We played some tremendous stretches of basketball this weekend,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I told our guys we were highly disappointed in how we finished yesterday or last night and I thought they came out and really played lights out ball in the first half.”
AN EVEN BETTER FINISH
In its matchup against Columbia the night before, the Crimson allowed a lead as high as 18 points to dissipate into a one point deficit with just over three minutes to play. While Harvard did allow a lead as high as 23 cut to just 10, the finish was without a doubt less of a nailbiter on Saturday night.
With just under two minutes to go Towns took it upon himself to close out the game. He drove in and banked one off the glass to extend the Crimson’s lead to 12 and on the ensuing possession drew a foul and made the basket to put the Crimson up 15 late.
“I just thought that Seth finishing around the rim there with late clock opportunities, Bryce making a few plays there himself,” Amaker said. “Those two guys in particular being really good offensive players and getting fouled. I just thought it was a nice stretch there where we were able to close on a very positive, high note.”
On top of the late offense, the Crimson made the most of its opportunities at the line. Harvard made 20 of its 24 free throws in the second half. On the other end of the floor, the Crimson outrebounded the Big Red 35 to 28 in the game. No single Cornell player tallied more than four rebounds.
“Obviously we have a lot of size,” senior forward Zena Edosomwan said. “I think it’s important when we use that size in the paint, and have that right mentality of just being a force, we can have all the difference.”
