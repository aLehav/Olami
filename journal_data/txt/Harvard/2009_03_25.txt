After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council unanimously approved a resolution last Monday night asking Harvard and MIT not to lay off low-wage workers, following recent staff cuts and hours reductions by cleaning companies subcontracted by Harvard.Some companies Harvard hires for cleaning services have announced layoffs in recent weeks, after the University asked some of those subcontractors to cut costs by 30 to 40 percent in response to projections of a 30 percent decline in Harvard’s endowment by the end of this fiscal year.Councillor Marjorie C. Decker, who sponsored the resolution, said that she would propose another order next week that would give Harvard a “mini-stimulus package”—possibly by reducing Harvard’s payments in lieu of taxes to the City—to help cover the costs of reinstating the laid-off janitors and to force the University to reconsider whether the money saved by the cuts was substantial enough to justify the lost jobs. Regardless of whether Harvard accepts the “stimulus,” Decker said, such a gesture of aid from the City would hopefully shame Harvard into realizing how unnecessary and immoral low-wage worker cuts are in light of its overall fiscal scheme.Decker said that the Council’s intervention was justified because laying off low-wage workers would likely burden the City and state’s homeless shelters, food pantries, and low-income housing services.University spokesman John D. Longbrake said that Harvard understands its responsibilities as a major employer and recognizes that it depends heavily on its staff to fulfill its academic mission. He added that Harvard has “taken a series of steps to minimize the impact of the global economic downturn on the people who work here” by strictly limiting hiring, freezing salaries for non-union staff and faculty, and offering a voluntary early retirement incentive plan for 1,600 workers. But since nearly half of Harvard’s $3.5 billion annual operating budget comes in the form of compensation costs, Longbrake said, “it is increasingly likely that Harvard, like many of our peer institutions and foundations across the country, will have to consider further changes to the size of its workforce in order to adjust to the new fiscal reality.”But Decker said that Harvard and MIT should consider pay cuts for their highest paid employees rather than laying off low-wage workers such as janitors.“Basically [Harvard and MIT] are saying ‘we are worried about the future of our endowment, so we are going to lay off workers who make between $16,000 and $30,000 a year,’” Decker said.Bedardo Sola, a former subcontracted janitor who worked at Harvard, said in Spanish through a translator at the meeting that he was laid off on Mar. 13 from a job he had held for five years. His unemployment has left him without health insurance, he said, and as a result, surgery to correct his wife’s blindness will now cost him $5,000.“I am here also to represent the many other workers who are under threat of layoffs, so that they never have to go through what we are going through now,” said Sola, who is represented by the Service Employees International Union Local 615. Wayne M. Langley, director of SEIU’s higher education division, said that his organization represents 1,500 employees at Harvard and MIT.Other union members employed at Boston University and MIT also spoke at the meeting to argue that even in times of economic crisis, universities should be held to a higher standard when it comes to treatment of their low-wage employees.Bill Jaeger, director of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, said that the City’s resolution was particularly timely since the window to accept the University’s early retirement package is closing and budget officials will likely be re-visiting their fiscal plans soon. HUCTW recently implemented a visibility campaign titled “Staff, Not Stuff” encouraging the University to focus on “slowing down and scaling back construction projects; reducing consulting, outside catering, and travel budgets; and investing in energy conservation and employee wellness,” rather than trimming staff.“There are a lot of budget managers who seem to be doing a great job of putting people in programs first, and really cutting in non-personnel areas as much as possible,” Jaeger said. “But it’s still really important to put those priorities out there, and to be sure everybody’s thinking as hard as they can and feeling as much pressure as they ought...to take care of Harvard’s good people.”But some councillors said they thought that layoffs are consistent with Harvard’s past behavior, and Councillor Tim Toomey said that the low-wage worker cuts are “just a continuation of how Harvard treats its employees.”Councillors said they hoped to see Harvard and MIT representatives at the next Council meeting to defend the low-wage worker cuts in person.—Staff writer Sarah J.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
President Obama has brought yet another Harvard name to Washington. Harvard Medical School professor David Blumenthal ’70 will oversee a $19.5 billion project to digitize medical records, the Department of Health and Human Services announced earlier this month.Blumenthal was named National Coordinator for Health Information Technology and will serve as one of three senior officials in health care in the Obama Administration, according to Kennedy School professor Richard J. Zeckhauser ’62.Though the digitization project has come under fire for its cost and possible privacy breeches, colleagues and interest groups applauded Blumenthal’s selection.As Director of the Institute for Health Policy at Massachusetts General Hospital, Blumenthal was a pioneer in health policy, said Zeckhauser, who has authored several papers with Blumenthal and taught him as a student.Prior to this, Blumenthal served as senior vice president at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and was a lecturer at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, where he earned a degree in public policy.Zeckhauser called the appointment the culmination of 25 years of training.He said Blumenthal is a “hard-headed enthusiast” and has the perspective to know that information technology will help the medical field, but is not a cure-all.“This is the attitude we want—some people think that when we have information technology in place, it will solve all our problems” Zeckhauser said. “Even though he’s young, he possesses a wisdom and gravitas.”Catherine M. DesRoches, of the Institute for Health Policy at Mass. General, said that when the Bush Administration first announced its goal to digitize medical records by 2014, there was no “baseline data” on current levels of digitized records.Because of this, she and Blumenthal co-authored a study charting rates of electronic medical record keeping. The research, published in the New England Journal of Medicine last July, found that only 4 percent of physicians had a fully functional electronic records system, and only 13 percent had a basic system in place.DesRoches said she was not surprised that the Obama administration tapped Blumenthal for the post.“This is an area he knows an awful lot about,” she said.Blumenthal was also senior health adviser during President Obama’s campaign and worked on the health policy staff of Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56 from 1977 to 1980.PROJECT CHALLENGESThe targeted implementation date for the digitization project, 2014, is viable, said Zeckhauser, but its success will depend on how much political objection there is in the interim—the roadblocks to implementing this project are administrative, not technical, he said.“Will there be some big privacy blowup that says you cannot use this record?” Zeckhauser asked.But Mark J. Schlesinger, a professor of health policy at the Yale School of Public Health, said that while he lauded both the project and the appointment, he was skeptical as to whether the project could be completed by the expected date, as Europeans have been working toward this goal for decades but have not yet reached it.“We are not just trying to create a system, but create a system for physicians and patients to more seamlessly share,” he said. “That takes a lot of learning, practice, and refinement.”Brian Wagner, director of Government Relations at eHealth Initiative, a non-profit umbrella organization that lobbies for information technology in the medical field on behalf of 165 member organizations, including AARP and the American Medical Association, called this project a “game changer.”Wagner said that the amount of money this package provides is equal to the funds available in the entire information technology industry on an annual basis.Though he said his organization applauded Obama and Congress for acting quickly with this appointment, there is worry about how funding will actually play out.Wagner said federal rules requiring “meaningful use” of health IT to qualify for funding were vague, and concerns arise regarding privacy provisions, how grants will be awarded, and areas not funded by the project.Schlesinger said that these programs are likely to be met with skepticism because results will not come for a while, which creates a thorny political situation.“You are spending money, not getting any benefit, but making people mad in the process,” he said.He said that Blumenthal has tremendous patience and perspective to see the project through, and that he would not have taken on the project if he did not see it as a long-term engagement.“I’m sure his expectations are appropriately set, but it is a frustrating position,” Schlesinger said. “It has considerable potential to be transformational, who knows how long people want to put up with the angst of that.”Blumenthal declined to comment for this article. —Staff writer Laura G.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The excitement of a fast-paced, neck-and-neck contest. The thrill of scoring with only seconds remaining. The heartbreak of a sudden overtime loss.No, this wasn’t an episode of Friday Night Lights or a made-for-TV college sports movie. This drama-filled endeavor was the beginning of the Harvard men’s lacrosse team’s spring break matchups.The No. 13 Crimson clashed with Georgetown yesterday on the Hoyas home Multi-Sport Field, falling to its non-league opponent in overtime, 8-9. This painful loss dropped Harvard’s record to 4-2 (1-0 Ivy.)“The game was hard fought,” said co-captain and defensive standout Max Gotschall. “Unfortunately we didn’t come out on the winning side.”The Crimson constantly switching leads with the Hoyas, but the emotional rollercoaster reached its break point in the last minute of regulation play, with two high-pressure goals occurring in the very limited time frame.As the clock wound down in the fourth quarter, with the two teams trapped in a 7-7 deadlock, Georgetown appeared to put a nail in the Crimson’s coffin. With only 53 seconds remaining, Hoyas’ Todd Cochran recorded an excruciating tally, giving Georgetown a last-minute advantage.However, with defeat looming in the air, Harvard’s freshman superhero Jeff Cohen came to his team’s rescue.“We needed someone to make a play,” said Cohen, who did just that.Cohen shot an unassisted rocket into the back of the Hoyas net with only 22 seconds on the clock, sending the Crimson into overtime.“It was just an extremely clutch goal,” co-captain Max Motschwiller said. “It was a gutsy play by [Cohen], and he’s been great for us all year.”Harvard’s effort was also bolstered by the outstanding performance of senior goalkeeper Joe Pike. Pike recorded 12 saves during the contest, greatly limiting Georgetown’s 41 shots.“Joe stood out,” Harvard coach John Tillman said. “He made some really big saves for us—he’s a senior force.”Unfortunately, that force was not enough to put Harvard over the edge. Georgetown junior Ricky Mirabito scored at 1:19 in overtime, claiming the win for the Hoyas.“Everyone could have done some things better,” Gotschall said. “We win as a team, lose as a team.”The Crimson started off the match with a bang, with freshman Kevin Vaughan scoring from sophomore Christian Oberbeck only six seconds into the first period. Georgetown retaliated with two tallies, bringing the Hoyas into the lead, but Harvard tied up the game with only two seconds remaining in the quarter with an unassisted goal from Motschwiller.The lead kept switching, as Georgetown recorded two more tallies towards the end of the second period, followed by an unassisted 2:33 score by sophomore Dean Gibbons and another unassisted goal, this time from senior Nick Sapia. The Crimson entered the locker room tied 4-4 at the end of the half.The Hoyas opened the third quarter with a solitary goal, followed by Gibbons’ second unassisted tally of the game at 0:25. The Crimson kept their scoring streak going into the fourth period, as Travis Burr found the net thirty seconds into the quarter off of an assist from Gibbons.Georgetown recorded three more tallies in the half, with Harvard evening up the score on another Burr unassisted goal and Cohen’s last-second endeavor.“We just had to do a couple of little things better to win,” Motschwiller said. “We could have cleared the ball a little better, we gave away our possessions—in a one-goal game, all those little plays add up.”The Crimson will have to overcome this disappointing loss as it looks forward to Friday’s matchup against Presbyterian.“We’re going to have to let go of our disappointment, and take all that disappointment and turn it into motivation to try to win the next game,” Tillman said. “Bad things will happen—it’s what you do next.”—Staff writer Alexandra J.
