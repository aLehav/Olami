Our cultural infatuation with — and repetition of — the term “character” will become infinitely more noticeable after reading Marjorie Garber’s “Character: The History of a Cultural Obsession.” In general, “character” refers to a measure of morality, a figure in literature and the media, or an indicator of boldness. Garber’s book provides a history of character, from its earliest reference as a word for engraving to its more diverse present meanings. With a heavy focus on the role of character in American politics and literature, Garber’s book sheds a necessary light on the often unrecognized influence of character in society. Although this work is not one to turn to for light-hearted pleasure or an easy read, it is a valuable addition to anyone’s reading list. Set for release on July 14, 2020, this book will undoubtedly shift readers’ perspectives on the complexities of a deceptively simple term.
Marjorie Garber, a Harvard professor of English and Visual and Environmental Studies, has written 18 single-authored books — six of which are about Shakespeare — and has edited seven collections. As a veteran of the genre, and with such an extensive background, it comes as no surprise that Garber’s book is eloquently composed.
Garber’s discussion of character renders the term such a monumental force that it seems impossible to cover all aspects of its meaning. Still, she manages to successfully tap on the significance of character in almost every dimension. Across eight chapters, Garber analyzes character in sports, media, psychoanalysis, art, and science, among other categories. With almost 40 pages of references, Garber pulls in a variety of work generated by other academics, as well as events that exemplify the significance of character in society, to substantiate her own analyses.
The most relevant and impactful components of Garber’s book bring the focus of character out of fictional literature and into the real world. Garber centers her argument around politics throughout the book, with a particular spotlight on President Donald Trump. Garber approaches the subject without holding back; in her first chapter, “Testing It,” which focuses on the prevalence of “character tests” in different career fields, Garber criticizes Trump’s questionable character and the unsurprising failure of the character test. Garber’s political analyses offer worthwhile insight into the 2016 presidential election and Trump’s time in office, as well as the upcoming 2020 presidential election. This discussion of politics also incites the occasional chuckle, as when Garber juxtaposes presidential efforts to maintain good moral character with immoral acts and unnecessarily rude claims. Her criticisms are sharp yet logically supported in such a way that even the most conservative grandparent at a big family dinner couldn’t argue against them.
Garber’s book also has an unforgettable chapter focused on national character called “Claiming It,” a section rendered more pertinent than ever amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The concept of a country’s “national character” is nothing new, but it becomes increasingly apparent during times of change and anxiety. Unfortunately, what is portrayed as a unifying idea often causes much conflict. Garber claims that the metaphor of the United States as a “melting pot” has become dead in the water in light of contemporary immigration issues, and this national hostility towards diversity can explain underlying racial tensions that may worsen the world’s current pandemic. “Claiming It” is an excellent deconstruction of American superiority, emphasizing the importance of national character as an identity that should be more inclusive than elite.
The point of this book is not to provide a clear-cut definition of “character,” but rather to highlight the many definitions and plethora of roles that character can play. Gardner even ends some of her sub-chapters with questions, leaving the reader to ponder the evidence presented. The incorporation of these queries makes the book even more thought-provoking, prompting readers to reconsider everything they thought they knew about the meaning of character. Garber is wise to not merely spout answers and claims at the audience — instead, she leaves room for interpretation and thought after arriving at the book’s end.
While sophisticated and filled to the brim with academic references, Garber’s book effectively makes the content accessible and interesting. “Character: The History of a Cultural Obsession” exemplifies Garber’s many areas of expertise, interacting well with other works to ultimately leave readers with a clarified perspective and new method of analyzing the complicated workings of society.

Building off of the success of her music video for the single “Physical,” Dua Lipa once again delivers high-energy theatrics in her latest video for “Break My Heart.” Lipa dropped her album “Future Nostalgia” shortly after the release of this video, enthralling diehard fans and casual pop-music lovers alike with the Taylor-Swift-esque angst, renewal, and energy of her empowering heartbreak anthems. The music video for “Break My Heart” is not unlike that of “Physical”— saturated colors, dizzying transitions, and lots of sexy Dua-Lipa-viewer eye contact — but instead of leaning into choreography, the “Break My Heart” video forgoes a coherent plot in favor of stunning visuals.
The video, which dropped on March 26, begins with a neon ‘80s title card, before panning to Lipa standing triumphantly on a car stuck in gridlock. She begins to sing with her signature look: apathetic, but sexy. As she moves among cars, space and time begins to warp and the first of many rapid transitions replaces the saturated lights of the city with an ‘80s-themed apartment as a full-size car flips into a toy one.
As she encounters the first (and incredibly irrelevant) man in the video, Lipa’s world tilts and the scenery collapses into a brightly colored dinner-club-performance-space hybrid. As Lipa enters, she gathers a crowd of back-up dancers and graces the neon light-up floor. Similar to her video for “Don’t Start Now” and many of her on-stage performances, Lipa does very little dancing herself. Instead, her back-up dancers swirl around her in monochromatic outfits while Lipa continues to strut forward in her color-blocked two piece, making much starker and sharper movements.
Amid her dancers, Lipa glances at a couple seated off-stage with an expression of simultaneous apathy and anguish before the back wall explodes, launching her into the next set (and costume change). She hurls through space until landing in the drab, inexplicably empty economy class of a plane, barely pausing before the next dizzying manipulation of her environment stretches the plane’s aisle into an endless echo of overhead compartments and weary travelers.
Without warning, the plane splits, leaving Lipa and her backup dancers, moonlighting as airline passengers, to strut through the gaping hole in the plane. Lipa is then overtaken by a yellow mass, and finds herself — fully dressed and made-up — in the bed of a confused man. She proceeds to rush through the open doorway, but just as she escapes the scene, the bedroom set slides to another presumably post-coital man, and then another. Lipa, in an appropriate response to this corruption of the space-time continuum, throws herself into a bubble bath.
From the bubbles of a girl’s night drink, Lipa emerges in her final outfit change — a red crop top and equally bright red plaid skirt — and resumes her strutting toward the camera without breaking eye-contact, while her backup dancers fall away into the neon scene behind her. In front of a circular window she pauses, just as the music ceases for a second before picking back up with renewed energy and launching Lipa through an even more rapid and whirling sequence of nonsensical but spatially stunning transitions. Lipa is thrown through all the previous scenes, finally finishing her odyssey through the explosion of space, color, and bodies on top of the video’s original car, blowing a bright pink bubble-gum bubble.
“Break My Heart” exemplifies the quintessential new era for Dua Lipa: extraordinary visuals filled with vivid color-blocking and mind-boggling manipulations of space, paired with vacantly sexy eye contact, all while strutting casually through explosions of artistic chaos that surround her.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The madness of March has passed, but the joy of filling out March Madness-style brackets lives on — especially during this extended period of being inside and online. One such bracket, of the many that have widely circulated across social media feeds and various corners of the internet, features the work of the exemplary, faultless, and unbeatable singer Beyoncé.
Although trying to rank Beyoncé’s works borders on sacrilege, listening, comparing, and articulating what makes her songs great is a joyous exercise for anyone familiar with her discography. While this bracket could be completed in countless defensible ways, the above represents just one humble account of Beyoncé’s best. This evaluation process took into consideration musical content — melody, harmonies, vocals, beats — as well as lyrics, featured musicians, and larger themes of the work.
The first round immediately involved some tough decisions. Tragically, top-seed picks “Drunk in Love” and “Green Light” faced off against each other in the first round. But “Drunk in Love”’s sultry melodies edged out “Green Light”’s perky enthusiasm. The historical collaboration between Beyoncé and Shakira, “Beautiful Liar,” defeated “Naughty Girl”’s breathtaking vocals. One of Beyoncé’s more mainstream songs, “Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It),” was bested by “End of Time,” a less-popular, just as catchy, and just as classic song with a marching-band style that echoes Beyoncé’s unforgettable “HOMECOMING” performance at Coachella (colloquially referred to as Beychella).
“Countdown”’s iconic musical elements — the opening vocal riff, the chromatic scale countdown, the cogent harmonies — gave the song enough momentum to beat out solid competition. “Get Me Bodied," especially the danceable extended mix, inspires and motivates. The raw emotion of “Sandcastles” proved tough to compare with arguably less intimate songs, giving it the edge over “Halo” and “I Care.” “BROWN SKIN GIRL” — nurturing, empowering, and enhanced by a feature from Beyoncé’s daughter Blue Ivy — made short work of its competitors.
“Party”’s creative and elaborate harmonies coupled with its carefree style skyrocketed it to the top four. The unrelenting beat of “Formation,” along with its unapologetic lyrics and subtle wordplay landed it among the top contendors as well. Despite a close stalemate with “Flawless,” “Partition”’s bold and memorable lyrics, including “Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor,” “He Monica Lewinsky’d all on my gown,” and social commentary in French, “les hommes pensent que les féministes détestent le sexe / mais c’est une activité très stimulante et naturelle que les femmes adorent (‘men think that feminists hate sex, but it's a very stimulating and natural activity that women love’),” took out much of the competition.
At the top — unsurprisingly and deservedly — is “Love on Top.” The bubbly melody never gets old, Beyoncé’s silky voice is gorgeous (as usual), and the mind-boggling five modulations from C major to E major, each bringing with it more energy and power, make this song impossible to beat.
The real winner of this bracket, though, is anyone who gets to listen to hours of countless Beyoncé hits in their efforts to fill it out.

UPDATED: April 21, 2020, 11:38 p.m.
When Lulu Wang’s film, “The Farewell,” premiered in 2019, I was slightly disappointed. From the synopsis and trailer, I was expecting an exploration of Chinese American identity, of the web of contradictions and struggles and gray areas that people brought up by two wholly different cultures have to grapple with every day. I was expecting a film for Asian Americans, for Chinese Americans, for people like me.
“In the East, a person’s life is part of a whole,” a character in “The Farewell” explains.”That’s the difference between the East and the West.” And therein lies the flaw of an otherwise flawless movie: It’s too forthright, too reductionist, and in its most important moments, feels like it’s lecturing its audience. The film treats the viewer as unacquainted with the Asian American experience, as if it’s afraid they’ll miss the point. In other words, it’s a movie for white people. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing; it’s important, I think, for white people to learn what their neighbors of color are going through. For Asian Americans, however, who have grappled with these cultural questions their whole lives, who seek depth and interrogation and nuance, Wang’s film falls short.
“Tigertail” does not.
The film follows Pin-Jui (played, of course, by Tzi Ma), a first-generation Taiwanese American immigrant, as he reflects and reminisces on his journey — a journey heavily inspired by the father of the film’s director, Alan M. Yang ’02. Pin-Jui’s story is, in many ways, the classic Asian American immigrant narrative. He leaves behind his friends, family, and soulmate to pursue a better life in America, and after decades of toil and perseverance, builds a comfortable life for himself, his wife, and his two adult children.
The movie is slow. Shots linger. Pauses in conversations are a beat longer than usual. All movements — tea pouring, piano playing, even a frantic dine and dash — feel subdued and deliberate, like everything’s part of a hazy, evanescent memory. The score helps too, coming only in the form of a solo violin and piano (or, occasionally, 1980s Mandopop), and cementing the mood: fluid, haunting, pensive.
It also looks quite beautiful. Despite my father having grown up in Taiwan, I have never been there. Yang’s depiction of Taiwan could, in fact, be completely wrong, and I would have no way of knowing. But the detail — the depth and idiosyncrasy with which he portrays the back alleys and flower-print dresses and outdoor food stalls of Pin-Jui’s hometown — makes it hard to argue with him. And when Yang adds the oversaturated colors and record-player-Mandopop and grainy high-ISO overlay, it feels like he’s got Wong Kar-wai on his side, too.
The film’s other settings, too, are treated with care and imbued with meaning. The lush open fields of rural Taiwan. The tiny, cramped, two-bedroom house where Pin-Jui lived with his mother, Minghua (Yang Kuei-mei). The two-story house he lives in now, however — with its flat screen TV, white ceramic tea kettle, and clean symmetrical lines — is nothing like the home, or the life, he left behind. In many ways, the story of an immigrant is this story of jumping between settings, between worlds.
And this immigrant narrative, this Asian American ethos, pervades the whole film. The dialogue, for example, is one-third Taiwanese, one-third Mandarin, and one-third English — mixed, much like the lives of its characters. After landing in America, Pin-Jui and his wife, Zhenzhen (Fiona Fu), embark on the well-trodden Chinese immigrant journey: They arrive broke and lonely at a dirty apartment, work long hours mopping floors at a grocery store, and, decades later, earn enough to settle down in a house in the suburbs, replete with a manicured rose garden and a piano for the kids to practice on.
Often — in the books, the movies, the TV shows — this is where the story stops. The parents, the Asian-Americans, fade into the background and the kids, the Asian Americans, take the spotlight (see “The Farewell,” for an example). And the kids grow up not knowing anything about their parents’ journeys: a reality represented by Pin-Jui’s daughter, Angela (Christine Ko) — a reality that Yang, in creating this film, is trying to change.
Yang makes it clear that Pin-Jui’s life isn’t the retired, suburban ideal that convention would dictate. Zhenzhen divorces him, a decision decades in the making (we learn that in his youth, Pin-Jui actually loved a girl named Yuan Lee, but married Zhenzhen instead so he could afford going to America). Pin-Jui’s relationship with his daughter is also strained — awkward lunches and silent car rides together bespeak a rift between the two, one caused, we learn, by Pin-Jui’s refusal to open up to his daughter. “You never told me what happened,” says Angela in the simple, moving climax of this tension. “You’re my father. I don’t even know how to talk to you, I never have. Maybe it’s easier if we just stop trying.”
Pin-Jui is a man who had always looked to the future, to moving to America, to securing a good life for his kids, all while burying his difficult and painful past. This movie is about the harm that this mindset inflicts on immigrant families — on Zhenzhen, on Angela, on himself. The solution, Yang posits, is to uncover the past, and both Yang and Pin-Jui do exactly that.
“There are many things I never told you,” Pin-Jui says to Angela, and so the resolution begins: a soft montage of father and daughter returning to Taiwan, to the open fields, their old home, the bar where Pin-Jui danced with his first love. “What was her name?” Angela asks, in Mandarin — the first time she does so the entire film. Pin-Jui responds, “Lee,” and tears up — the first time he does so the entire film, too. The camera pulls away and fades to black, ending the film with the two of them standing on his childhood street — “虎尾” or “tiger tail” — together at last.
“Tigertail,” much like “The Farewell,” is a great movie. The cinematography is great. The score is masterful. The acting is stellar. But “Tigertail” tells a much different story, a story tailored to Yang’s audience: the second-generation, Netflix-streaming Asian Americans who grew up with a father like Pin-Jui. It’s the story that we haven’t heard, about the narratives that don’t fall into the neat categorizations of immigrant toil and success, about what people like Pin-Jui or Yang’s father leave behind. It’s a story about our parents, born of Yang’s attempt to learn about his own — and in making this film, Yang calls upon us to do the same.

If comparisons between the Great Pandemic and the Great War show that great events will “have permanent, drastic consequences,” we should think beyond the descriptive question of what the consequences are or may be, and consider the normative question of what the consequences should be.
World leaders in the aftermath of World War I failed to adequately prepare the world for international peace and cooperation, and the world suffered the consequences. Now, as we slowly emerge from the shadows of the pandemic, we should acknowledge the significance and necessity of international cooperation and commit ourselves to achieving it.
There are times in history when we find ourselves at the mercy of forces beyond any individual’s control, and some examples strike surprisingly close to the present pandemic: global rivalries spiraling out of control (World War I), an initially unknown viral pathogen decimating entire populations (Christopher Columbus’ conquest), and governments sliding into protectionism as existing market supply and demand are interrupted (the Great Depression). This predicament of passivity is especially real in the midst of a pandemic, when the existing world order is upended by a nonliving particle. In Anthony Fauci’s words, “You don't make the timeline, the virus makes the timeline.”
But even if the virus makes the timeline, human agency is not completely denied. We are, in one way or another, choosing how to react in the face of forces beyond human control. We will be responsible for the consequences of our choices, and this means we must choose actively and responsibly.
We must truthfully and faithfully record what has happened already, which entails remembering the source of the virus (without subscribing to groundless and shameful conspiracy theories) as well as China’s initial coverup. But the story does not end there; instead of merely accusing China of rewriting the narrative of the pandemic, other countries should seek to co-write it. For the Western world to assume that the narrative is complete and definitive, with China as the culprit and the world order as its victim, would be to concede one’s agency and ability to change the course of the pandemic and, by extension, its legacies.
Now, more than ever, we must assert the virtues of globalism. From its rapid spread to the rapid worldwide shutdowns in response, the coronavirus has demonstrated how interconnected the world is. A global health crisis requires global solutions. President Barack Obama demonstrated this foresight in his handling of the Ebola crisis in collaboration with China, with the European Union simultaneously contributing as well. And during the SARS outbreak in 2003, the World Health Organization used its power, credibility, and authority appropriately to coordinate a successful response.
We need global unity and leadership to coordinate a worldwide response to the coronavirus as well. But based on the WHO’s willingness to parrot the Chinese government and the near-comic American “modern piracy” of protective equipment, leadership from the WHO and the United States is clearly lacking. This leaves a void to be filled by others, as — believe it or not — Russia, China, and Taiwan have. Instead of portraying these acts of aid through the lens of fear-mongering and suspicion, other countries should recognize that the geopolitical significance of aid only speaks to its necessity.
Of course, it would be naive to think that countries are doing this purely out of goodwill and devoid of any diplomatic considerations. In fact, they have much to gain by helping (of course, only if their aid is actually helpful). But that’s beside the point. After all, so goes any act of international cooperation — we all stand to gain from helping each other, and countries are thankful for aid, regardless of its source, because aid is necessary. We should be wary of the strings attached, if any, but we should also thank the countries that reached out and hold those that turned their backs accountable.
In the aftermath of World War I, countries refused to interact internationally. The U.S. embraced isolationism while France and the United Kingdom appeased Adolf Hitler’s ascent, eager to avoid international conflicts at all costs. They reasoned that the lives abroad are not worth a life at home. The League of Nations, designed to foster international cooperation, was effectively powerless, with no capacity to prevent the next war.
But in a globalized world, national crises do not contain themselves within artificial borders. In the form of refugee crises, threats of invasion and terrorism, second wave infections, and economic burdens, they come back to haunt us, sometimes with increased ferocity. Therefore, isolationism must not be a lasting consequence from the pandemic, especially as current issues, like climate change, are increasingly global and require global collaboration. Let us hope that the WHO (which must now weather criticism and decreased support), and other international organizations, will not follow in the League of Nations’ demise, but be strengthened and revitalized after this global crisis.
Today, we know better than before. We have medical knowledge about viral pathogens, hindsight from historical failures of international cooperation, requisite technology for constant communication, and cultural knowledge for respectful exchanges. Today, we have the toolbox to defeat an international crisis without sacrificing ourselves. We should use it actively and responsibly. And we should definitely not burn it to fan the flames of nationalist fervor.

The Harvard Corporation has directed the Harvard Management Company to develop a plan to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote in a message to faculty Tuesday afternoon.
“Climate change is a defining issue of our time,” Bacow wrote. “Harvard is confronting this challenge in our teaching, our research, and through ambitious sustainability efforts on our own campus.
The Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — requested HMC develop a plan for achieving greenhouse gas neutrality by 2050 and present it to the Corporation by the end of 2020.
“With this commitment, our focus is on reducing the demand for fossil fuels, an action that is consistent with the University’s overall commitment to reduce our operational carbon footprint,” Bacow wrote. “It will require us to work with other investors to develop tools to monitor the carbon footprint of our investment managers. If we are successful, we will reduce the carbon footprint of our entire investment portfolio and achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.”
The endowment was last valued at $40.9 billion in June 2019 and includes public and private equities, stocks, bonds, natural resources, real estate, and other investments.
According to the announcement, HMC will collaborate with faculty and other experts to develop a methodology for calculating greenhouse gas emissions and work with its external asset managers to gain transparency and measure their portfolio’s emission levels.
“It’s always difficult to gather comprehensive data for the first time—especially on this scale—but we will take every opportunity to refine and improve our analysis as we work toward a net-zero portfolio,” N.P. “Narv” Narvekar, the CEO of HMC, said in a press release.
“Harvard’s pledge today supplements our many ongoing efforts to prepare for and accelerate the necessary transition to a fossil fuel-free economy,” Bacow added.
The University previously pledged to be fossil fuel free by 2050 and fossil fuel neutral by 2026 in the operations and maintenance of the campus.
Over the past several years, campus activist groups including Divest Harvard have garnered national attention in calling for the University to divest completely from the fossil fuel industry. Most recently, in a statement released in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, the group linked Harvard’s quick response to the pandemic to its demand for divestment.
“The administration proved that it can act with urgency if it wants to, and we support their general decision to rapidly upend the status quo when necessary,” the press release from Divest Harvard reads.
In a February demonstration, Divest Harvard called on the University to divest from the fossil fuel industry by Earth Day 2020, which is tomorrow.
In February, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted 179-20 to approve legislation demanding the University divest its endowment from fossil fuels. The final motion that passed included an amendment introduced by English professor James T. Engell ’73, which added that all future endowment investments should be subjected to a “system of decarbonization” in order to meet “internationally agreed standards of emission reduction.”
According to University spokesperson Jason A. Newton, the announcement Bacow made to faculty on Tuesday aligns with the intent of the Engell amendment; similarly, the 2050 time frame aligns with the goal of the Paris Agreement, an international climate accord, to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050.
In addition, Harvard has become an official supporter of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, which seeks to increase transparency in corporate reporting of climate-related financial risks, according to the press release.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 21, 2020, 7:24 p.m.
United States President Donald Trump said in a press conference Tuesday evening that he would request Harvard return the nearly $9 million it was granted as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act.
At the press conference, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said the aid money was not intended for “big public companies.”
“And not for Harvard,” Trump added.
Trump referenced the size of Harvard’s endowment at the press conference. The endowment was valued at $40.9 billion dollars as of Spring 2019. Top administrators, however, say it has likely shrunk as a result of the pandemic.
“Harvard’s going to pay back the money,” Trump said. “And they shouldn’t be taking it. So Harvard’s going to. You have a number of — I’m not going to mention any other names — but when I saw Harvard, they have one of the largest endowments anywhere in the country, maybe in the world, I guess, and they’re going to pay back that money.”
It remains unclear by what mechanism, exactly, the University would return the funds. Indeed, Harvard may not have received the allocated money yet — as of Friday, the Department of Education had only provided $6 million in aid to colleges nationwide, according to Politico.
The White House declined to comment further.
Yesterday, after receiving backlash from several prominent Republican politicians, the University announced it would dedicate 100 percent of the $8.6 million it received from the CARES Act to student financial assistance.
Though Mnuchin referenced businesses in his comments, funds for businesses and funds for higher education come from two separate parts of the CARES Act, which Trump signed into law on March 27.
The funds allocated to Harvard stem from a $14 billion allocation to the Department of Education through the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund. The funds for small businesses were allocated by the Small Business Administration through the Paycheck Protection Program, which had a separate $349 billion allocation.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard has not applied for or received funds through the Paycheck Protection Program, which he said would have been inappropriate.
“Harvard did not apply for, nor has it received any funds through the U.S. Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses. Reports saying otherwise are inaccurate. President Trump is right that it would not have been appropriate for our institution to receive funds that were designated for struggling small businesses,” Swain wrote.
Swain reiterated that 100 percent of the CARES ACT funds will go to student financial assistance.
“This financial assistance will be on top of the support the University has already provided to students – including assistance with travel, providing direct aid for living expenses to those with need, and supporting students’ transition to online education," Swain wrote.
Later in the press conference, another reporter asked Trump how confident he was that he’d be able to “claw back” funds from Harvard and others.
“Well, look, I don’t like when Harvard that has, I think, a $40 billion dollar endowment, or some incredible amount of money, that Harvard gets this money? Harvard should pay this money back. I want Harvard to pay that money back,” Trump said. “And if they won’t do that, then we won’t do something else. They have to pay it back. I don’t like it.”
Trump also suggested that the funds that Harvard is set to receive were intended for businesses, though they were not.
“This is meant for workers. This isn’t meant for one of the richest institutions — not only, far beyond schools — in the world. They gotta pay it back. I want them to pay it back,” Trump added.

Researchers at the Harvard Global Health Institute estimate the United States will need to perform at least 500,000 coronavirus tests per day in order to successfully reopen the economy, according to a Saturday report.
The report was published just a few days after the White House released a set of recommendations for states to ease social distancing measures in planned phases.
HGHI Director Ashish K. Jha, health policy professor Thomas C. Tsai ’05, and HGHI research assistant Benjamin Jacobson aimed to predict the number of tests needed per day if the country adopted the approach of testing, tracing, and isolating all individuals presenting coronavirus symptoms.
Jha said the researchers found that, under this scenario, the country would need to perform between 500,000 to 700,000 tests per day.
While he noted that the estimates were “incredibly conservative,” Jha said the team believes 500,000 tests is the “bare minimum” for the country to safely open up.
To increase testing capacity from the current approximately 150,000 daily tests, Jha said the country needs to address shortages in crucial supplies for testing. In particular, he pointed to the limited supply of testing materials including swabs, chemical reagents, and protective equipment for workers performing the tests.
“There is no single roadblock. There are a whole bunch of mini roadblocks or moderate-sized roadblocks,” Jha said.
To safely open up under the test, trace, and isolate approach, Jha said states need to see very low numbers of new cases for several weeks to ensure minimal active transmission. He also noted that hospitals still need to be prepared for the possibility that spikes in infections could occur after lifting social distancing measures
The reopening of the national economy would need to proceed gradually and include efficient analysis of the virus’s spread, he said.
“You start slow, you build, and you let the data drive the decision making,” Jha said. “And you also try to do some studies to say, ‘Hey, are restaurants an important source of transmission?’ If they’re not, maybe you can relax those restrictions faster.”
Jacobson wrote in an email that the necessary rate of testing could fluctuate after states lift restrictions depending on the subsequent number of new cases.
“If social distancing and testing successfully continue to reduce cases, the number of tests needed daily might decrease by later in May,” he wrote. “In contrast, if cases begin to surge again we would likely need considerably more than 500,000 per day to effectively contain that secondary outbreak.”
Jacobson added that, ultimately, an effective vaccine would be crucial to end the spread of the virus.
“Having an effective vaccine for COVID-19 is certainly going to be a critical step in bringing the pandemic to an end,” Jacobson wrote. “For a number of reasons, we can’t simply continue sheltering in place as a country for another year.”
“Testing is a valuable tool in bridging the gap from here to a vaccine,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University Health Services is now providing video appointments for its services, which include internal medicine, urgent care, counseling and mental health services, and behavioral health, according to a Tuesday email from HUHS chief medical officer Soheyla D. Gharib.
Since most students departed campus last month, HUHS only provided a telephone option for non-essential visits. Now, patients will be able to connect with HUHS health professionals on a version of Zoom that complies with federal patient privacy regulations.
Gharib wrote that HUHS is trying to continue patient care while complying with social distancing measures to limit the spread of coronavirus.
“During these unprecedented times, we want to ensure that you receive the care you need while upholding vitally important social distancing measures that minimize the number of patients at HUHS,” she wrote.
According to an FAQ page about telemedicine on the HUHS website, clinicians will not be able to diagnose patients with coronavirus over video appointments. They will, however, be able to advise patients about steps to take if they experience symptoms of the virus.
“Your clinician cannot diagnose coronavirus during a telehealth visit, but they can offer self-care and quarantine tips, educate patients about when they need to go to a hospital, and if they do, help to coordinate testing,” the FAQ reads.
Clinicians will be able to make some other diagnoses via telemedicine.
“Your clinician will utilize a video camera to conduct your physical exams,” the FAQ reads. “The camera allows your clinician to closely inspect any areas of concern, such as swelling, rashes, or wounds to help make an evidence-based diagnosis.”
Gharib added that telemedicine can be used for a number of other purposes in addition to diagnosing patients.
“Telemedicine can be used as an alternative to traditional in-person care, and in certain circumstances, can be used to deliver care such as diagnosis, consultation, treatment, education, and care management,” Gharib wrote. “Telemedicine allows for you to receive evaluation, drug prescriptions, and test orders.”
Telemedicine services will be of no additional cost to students as visits are covered by the Student Health Fee. Additionally, because of regulatory adjustments, HUHS patients will not have to pay out of pocket for these visits.
Gharib noted that, along with the new option for video services, telephone appointments are still available, as are in-person visits for essential and urgent care.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard created a “Presidential Committee on Sustainability” to advise University President Lawrence S. Bacow and other top administrators, the University announced Monday.
The committee’s work will focus on “defining fossil-fuel neutral, energy-reduction opportunities in Harvard’s buildings, and other issues,” according the Harvard Gazette, a University-run news publication. It will include subcommittees consisting of faculty and student members, according to the Gazette.
The announcement comes nearly two months after the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the Harvard Medical School Faculty Council voted overwhelmingly in favor divesting the University’s endowment from fossil fuel companies.
Separately, Bacow informed faculty members Tuesday afternoon that the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — directed the Harvard Management Company to establish planning in order to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Previously, the University committed to being fossil fuel-free by 2050 and fossil fuel-neutral by 2026 as part of its Climate Action Plan.
Harvard Kennedy School professor John P. Holdren, who co-chairs the committee, said in an interview with the Gazette that the committee aims to demonstrate that Harvard is serious about taking action.
“The committee was formed as a response to President Bacow’s very specific request to look at how Harvard could meet the goals that were set forth in a previous committee on sustainability at the University, and to advise on the direction of the University’s overall sustainability vision and plan,” Holdren said. “Harvard’s greatest impact will be to tap the faculty, students, and staff to apply the latest thinking and research, not only to achieve this University’s goals, but ultimately to advance global sustainability solutions.”
Harvard Business School professor Rebecca M. Henderson, who also co-chairs the committee, said in an interview with the Gazette that the committee’s work is motivated by the urgency of climate change.
“We need to act now because the longer we leave it, the more expensive it will be for all of us,” she said. “We have a sense of what the technologies are that can enable us to transition to a greatly carbon-reduced economy, and we need to implement them now, in as widespread a manner as we can.”
Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp told the Gazette that Harvard has University-wide sustainability goals to address the “real-world challenges threatening the health and well-being of people and the planet.”
“This has resulted in an extraordinary level of collaboration across our diverse and decentralized campus,” she said. “Partnerships between our students, researchers, faculty, and staff have allowed us to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations, institutionalize best practices, and generate solutions that can be scaled up and widely replicated beyond the boundaries of our campus."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Medical School and Partners HealthCare came under fire this week for an email asking fourth-year medical students to volunteer at the Boston Hope medical center, a recently-opened 1000-bed COVID-19 recovery center.
The Medical School told its fourth-year students on April 17 that the volunteer opportunity — which is open to graduating students at medical schools across Boston — could serve as an “ultimate capstone” before they began their internships.
“The COVID-19 pandemic is a once in a lifetime challenge that will define for our generation what is really important both professionally and personally,” the email read.
Partners HealthCare created Boston Hope in collaboration with Massachusetts Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79, Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh, Boston HealthCare for the Homeless, the United States military.
Rich Copp, a spokesperson for Partners HealthCare, wrote in an email to The Crimson that the call from Harvard for additional volunteers was “part of this community effort.”
The opportunity comes after Medical School leadership began to explore the option of allowing fourth year students to graduate early and begin residency ahead of schedule in response to the strain of coronavirus on the healthcare system.
This program is distinct: participants will not have graduated, and will be volunteering in their capacity as medical students, rather than working as medical residents.
Critics on social media took issue with the wording of the email, in addition to some aspects of the volunteer program itself.
Michael A. McClurkin — a current resident at Yale-New Haven Hospital and a recent graduate of Harvard Medical School — said that he took issue with the phrase “ultimate capstone.” He said he feared students would feel compelled to volunteer for fear of missing out on an opportunity.
Mudit Chowdhary — a resident at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago — wrote on Twitter that the email was “emotional blackmail encouraging impressionable medical students to work for free.”
“This is a very serious situation around the country right now and the world,” Chowdhary said in an interview. “The phrasing made it seem like this is just like a happy go lucky, ‘let's go do it’ type of interaction.”
Chowdhary and McClurkin also expressed concerns over the fact that students were being asked to volunteer without receiving salaries, stipends, or additional insurance.
“It's a real risk to your life, and a job that gives a real risk to your life should not be volunteered for. It should be paid,” Chowdhary said.
Reflecting on his experience at the start of residency, McClurkin said he feared the experience might be “traumatic” rather than educational.
“It was very difficult, and it wasn't during a pandemic and I just can't imagine being in a field hospital in a pandemic, if you're just starting and there's not systems in place to really help you navigate through that transition from student to physician,” he said.
The email to students provided a detailed description of their role as volunteers, stating they would receive funding for transportation to shifts at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center along with appropriate personal protective equipment.
“Each student will be working directly with a clinical supervisor and up to 6 COVID-19 patients who they will be responsible for the care, paperwork and follow-up for,” the email read.
Those who decide to volunteer will need to complete basic life support and personal protective equipment training before starting and participate in regular group debriefings and wellness check-ins on site, per the email.
The email to students also said they would have access to testing in case of illness or exposure and that they would receive detailed information on what to do if they are sick.
Eighteen students have signed up to volunteer for eight available slots, Harvard Medical School spokesperson Laura DeCoste wrote in an email.
“We understand that not everyone feels called to this type of volunteer service, and we are proud of all of our students and respect their individual decisions,” DeCoste wrote. “We are glad that many of those who volunteered will be able to contribute in this meaningful way.”
Lisa E. Simon — a fourth-year student at the Medical School who has volunteered for the program — said she shared some other students’ concerns but still felt it was important to volunteer.
“These sorts of offers are really difficult to make to people, both because people might feel compelled to participate in something that has risk for them, and because we need to have structural protections in place to make sure people can take care of patients safely,” Simon, a former Dental School instructor, said.
Simon also said she thinks that the Medical School and Partners HealthCare had good intentions.
“I don't think that the hospital system is in any way trying to exploit students,” Simon said. “It runs up against these really tough issues surrounding student roles versus labor practices and even administrative barriers surrounding licensure. I think this isn't an issue of malign intent, but it's nonetheless very difficult.”
Correction: April 22, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Rush University Medical Center is in New York. In fact, it is in Chicago.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Faculty in Harvard’s Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations say they are concerned about increased discrimination against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in light of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
These concerns come as the number of reported racist attacks against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders has spiked, according to an open letter published April 15. The letter was signed by Harvard faculty members from across the University as well as instructors from several other institutions across the nation.
As part of its effort to combat bias amid the pandemic, the EALC department published a comprehensive list of resources for those who experience discrimination on its departmental website on March 24.
EALC professor Karen L. Thornber said “social responses” to diseases can sometimes inflict “more intense” suffering than their health effects.
Social responses include “stigmas,” medical professionals “focusing more on the disease than the person,” society’s “mistreatment” of medical professionals, and a societal failure to “support patients’ families,” according to Thornber.
Thornber also said the increase in discrimination caused by the pandemic is not surprising.
“Unfortunately the discrimintation we see against AAPI populations as a result of the pandemic is something we’ve seen during most pandemics or other health crises throughout world history,” she said.
EALC professor James Robson echoed Thornber’s assessment, pointing to both the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II and the increased acts of racism which followed the 9/11 attacks.
“These are Americans, ” Robson said. “They are fully identified as American, and just because they look different they become the targets of stereotyping, scapegoating, and other kinds of problems.”
Michael A. Szonyi, a professor of Chinese history, emphasized the need to oppose racism particularly in times of crisis.
“We need to fight against racism of any kind, not just racism against a certain group of people defined by their citizenship,” Szonyi said.
He said while he has found the increased discrimination against Asian American and Pacific Islanders “disappointing,” he is hopeful the current crisis will lead to positive change through a greater emphasis on issues of race and ethnicity at the University.
This could include more courses and faculty dealing with Asian American and Pacific Islander issues, which should be a part of an “institutional commitment to ethnic studies,” according to Szonyi.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay announced in June 2019 that she would hire three to four faculty who specialize in Asian American, Latinx, and Muslim American studies by the end of the 2019-2020 academic year. Last week, however, she suspended the search indefinitely due to difficulties caused by the pandemic.
Thornber wrote that she has begun planning courses for next semester on global pandemics and their impact on vulnerable communities. She underscored the need for individual and collective efforts to combat bias.
“Do not let the bias that we witness or that others share with us go unchallenged,” Thornber said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After Harvard cancelled summer programming and as uncertainty about future semesters looms, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana outlined the process by which students may petition for summer housing in a Friday interview.
After the College mandated students vacate campus last month to avoid the spread of coronavirus, many students expressed anxieties over their ability to return home. Some said they could not afford the cost of transport; others worried about returning to unstable or unsafe home environments or hailed from countries whose borders had closed.
As these students navigated what some described as an opaque petition process to stay on campus for the remainder of the spring semester, many scrambled to find alternate arrangements with friends, peers, and concerned alumni.
The College recently announced that non-graduating students who successfully petitioned for — and accepted — spring housing will be eligible to apply to remain on campus for the summer. Khurana said the College has been conducting individual outreach to such students who may require summer housing.
“The approach we take is that there's individual reach-out from different offices depending on what issues the students may be confronting,” he said. “For students who are facing different types of issues, resident deans will be reaching out to those students, or those students have also been told to reach out to their resident deans if they'll need summer residences.”
The Dean of Students Office wrote in an email last Monday to students currently staying at Harvard that housing will be “extremely limited” this summer. Only students currently housed on campus, enrolled for both the spring 2020 and fall 2020 semesters, and not slated to graduate this semester may petition to extend their stay in residence through the summer. These criteria exclude students who successfully petitioned for spring on-campus housing, but ultimately chose to forgo it.
The email invited graduating seniors, who are ineligible for summer housing, to reach out to their resident deans if they are concerned for their plans after they leave campus. The summer housing petition process opened Friday and will remain open until Thursday.
To be considered for housing, students must be unable to return home due to one or more of the following conditions: inability to travel due to immigration visa restrictions; inability to safely return home due to housing insecurity, financial insecurity, or other extraordinary personal circumstances related to health and safety; or previous identification as being independent for the purposes of financial aid.
Tomasz Cienkowski ’22, a student from Poland who petitioned last week, said he believes he qualifies for the first condition because the Polish government decided to close the country’s borders in March and airlines have suspended most inbound flights due to the pandemic.
Cienkowski added that because the U.S. has temporarily banned entry for foreign nationals from Europe, he also wants to avoid being barred from returning to campus in the fall.
“Given the uncertainty that we don't know what's going on in the fall, I just thought that leaving the country now wouldn't be too reasonable because maybe I wouldn't be let back in or maybe I would be burdened with a much greater delay in time,” he said.
Vladyslav “Vlad” Ivanchuk ’23, a student from Ukraine, said the summer petition is clearer than the “vague” process he endured to secure housing for the spring term.
Ivanchuk similarly said he petitioned to stay for the remainder of this semester because coronavirus prevented his return home to Ukraine, which also closed its borders in March.
“I'm grateful they're making it more straightforward now than it was before the spring semester,” he said. “I was much more worried back then than I am now.”
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an email that a committee of representatives from the College’s residential life, the housing office, and resident deans will review each individual petition and consult with the Harvard International Office and other offices, as appropriate.
She added that the College announced the application and review process as soon as they finalized the summer plan for emergency housing after “much thought and planning.”
Cienkowski said he appreciated the $200 price tag for summer housing, but was frustrated that the College will not begin notifying students if they are approved for housing until April 29 — just over two weeks before the move-out deadline on May 17.
“I don't know how much anxiety, stress, mental health damage that could cause to someone if they found out that they have to move out two weeks before and find themselves in a foreign, plague-ridden country without any support network,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though most faculty members support the University’s commitment to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from its endowment by 2050, they are divided over whether the plan — announced on Tuesday — goes far enough.
Faculty reactions reflect a fissure that first developed during a four-month debate leading up to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ February vote on a motion urging the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, to divest.
While members of Harvard Faculty for Divestment — a group which has called for divestment for over five years — argued for the removal of all investments in fossil fuel companies, some faculty pushed for a focus on overall carbon footprint.
The FAS ultimately passed the pro-divestment motion 179-20 at its February faculty meeting.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote in a letter to faculty that Tuesday’s decision constituted the Harvard Corporation’s response to the FAS motion.
In a response to Bacow Tuesday evening, Harvard Faculty for Divestment called the HMC decision a “significant step,” but called for more decisive action.
“While the path is the right one, the pace is too slow. The goal of a carbon-neutral portfolio by 2050 is simply not ambitious enough,” the group wrote. “A 2050 target date does not jibe with the urgency of our situation.”
Harvard set a 2050 target in accordance with the international Paris Agreement on climate change, which was written in 2015 and entered into force in 2016.
In his letter to faculty, Bacow wrote that divestment would be a “symbolic act” that risks “alienating and demonizing possible partners” in decarbonizing the economy.
In its response, the faculty group wrote that it was “disappointed” in Bacow’s arguments against divestment.
“It is incongruous, if not counterproductive, to pursue a decarbonized portfolio while continuing to invest in the very companies that supply the carbon and, moreover, that continue to do far more to perpetuate that supply—and the demand for it—than they do to reduce it,” the letter reads.
The group instead endorsed a decarbonization plan written by former Securities and Exchange Commissioner Bevis Longstreth, which calls for Harvard to remove investments in fossil fuel companies by 2021 and align its portfolio with the Paris Agreement by the end of 2030.
Other faculty members said they preferred the net-zero commitment to outright divestment.
Government professor Dustin Tingley — who argued against the divestment motion during the February meeting — said the net-zero commitment was “more likely to be successful” than divestment.
“I think this policy will be one where the pressure that we are able to fruitfully bring to those companies will be a more productive one than something that would be more radical,” Tingley said.
Economics professor John Y. Campbell wrote in an email that Harvard’s commitment will push companies to reduce carbon emissions.
“Value-driven investing, if implemented by enough investors, will drive down the stock prices of carbon-intensive companies and raise their cost of capital,” Campbell wrote. “It will encourage companies to reduce their carbon emissions and will shrink the companies that fail to do so.”
Campbell added that it will also force companies to develop new methods to calculate their carbon footprint.
“This is part of the value of Harvard’s approach,” Campbell wrote. “We cannot manage what we cannot measure, and Harvard as a leading investor will be encouraging better measurement – and ultimately management – of carbon emissions throughout the economy.”
Harvard Kennedy School professor Robert N. Stavins, who directs the Harvard Environmental Economics Program, agreed that HMC’s actions will spur innovation in measuring carbon footprint.
“I suspect that this strategy will not only push some companies to do a better job of estimating their carbon footprint, but it will also stimulate at Harvard productive faculty and student research that can move the methodological frontier forward,” Stavins wrote in an email.

Divest Harvard, a student group calling on the University to divest from the fossil fuel industry, argued that Harvard’s commitment to making its endowment carbon-neutral by 2050 falls short of achieving the group's goal of total withdrawal from the industry.
“Until today, the administration has claimed that the endowment should not be used for political purposes,” Divest Harvard’s press release reads. “Now, thanks in no small part to years of student, faculty, and alumni activism, it has acknowledged its duty to mitigate the emissions its endowment has been fueling for decades.”
In February, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted overwhelmingly in favor of divestment from fossil fuels. At the time, Bacow said he would bring their resolution before the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body.
In a Tuesday message to faculty, Bacow acknowledged that the decision to go carbon-neutral by 2050 falls short of many divestment activists’ demands, but he argued that the school cannot drive a wedge between the school and “possible partners.”
“We appreciate that advocates for divestment from fossil fuel companies may not be satisfied with this approach, but we believe that divestment paints with too broad a brush,” Bacow wrote. “We cannot risk alienating and demonizing possible partners, some of which have committed to transitioning to carbon neutrality and to funding research on alternative fuels and on strategies to decarbonize the economy.”
Though Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard wrote that today’s announcement was “a step in the right direction,” they concluded that Harvard’s plan is “insufficient.” The group wrote that the plan still allows for investments in fossil fuels while relying on the hope that fossil fuel companies will become “cooperative partners,” and provided the University with a “wide margin” to calculate its portfolio emissions under a “protracted” timeline.
In February, Divest Harvard occupied University Hall, calling for the University to divest from fossil fuels by today, Earth Day 2020.
“A good-faith effort to reach carbon neutrality would have acknowledged that divestment is the logical first step,” the group wrote. “Instead, by not including divestment as one of its commitments today, Harvard is continuing to provide social and economic capital to the forces standing in the way of a decarbonized future. As the world burns, Harvard continues to defend the arsonists.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to provide comment beyond Bacow’s message to faculty.
In the press release, Divest Harvard wrote that while other institutions such as the University of California, Georgetown University, Brown University, and the University of Oxford committed to fossil fuel divestment, Harvard is not following suit.
“Its inaction only shows us the importance of putting younger and more diverse representatives of our community, and those committed to the principles the university preaches, into positions of power,” they wrote.
Caleb D. Schwartz ’20, a former Crimson multimedia editor and press representative for Divest Harvard, said he fears a 2050 deadline will be insufficient to address climate change.
“I'm really concerned, not just for my future, but for the future of my generation and the future of all the people who live on the planet right now, especially those who are already marginalized and facing the effects of climate change,” Schwartz said. “Climate change is not a problem for future generations. It's happening right now.”
Still, Schwartz said he remains optimistic that Harvard Management Company will eventually divest from the fossil fuel industry.
“I think they will divest,” he said. “I think, to eventually, in order to be completely carbon free, they will have had to divest. But it's a big difference if they divest in 2049 versus if they divest in 2020.”

The Mass Cultural Council reported $264 million in revenue losses in the arts and cultural sector statewide due to the coronavirus pandemic in an April 15 press release.
The MCC, a Boston-based arts funding agency, surveyed nearly 700 arts and cultural organizations across Massachusetts from April 4 to April 14. The organizations reported laying off, furloughing, or reducing hours and wages for more than 15,000 workers.
Moreover, 91 percent of respondents reported cancelling events and programs, and 95 percent of organizations with physical facilities have closed their spaces to the public. The MCC plans to share this data with state legislators.
Anita Walker, executive director of the MCC, said the arts and cultural sectors are important for the health and economic development of the state.
“Arts and culture are incredibly powerful community builders,” she said. “Not being able to make those human connections and bring people together at a time when they are isolated — we're going to see a lot of consequences in terms of the health and wellbeing of people in Massachusetts.”
In conducting surveys and providing relief funds for artists, the MCC and its advocacy partners hope legislators continue to support the arts by developing relief packages to offset the economic impacts of coronavirus, according to Walker.
“I think what we've made abundantly clear is that our arts and cultural organizations and our individual working artists — these are assets and treasures that really belong to the public,” she said.
Several Cambridge organizations have also stepped up to provide relief for artists.
The Cambridge Community Foundation, a local charity, began the Cambridge Artists Relief Fund to provide grants to local artists and cultural organizations facing financial burdens.
Geeta K. Pradhan, president of the foundation, emphasized the impact of coronavirus on the arts sector.
“The arts actually thrive on the opposite of social distancing. They thrive on social connectedness,” she said. “And having lost that has been a big, big, big hitch to the arts, more than any other sector that I can think of.”
The Cambridge Public Library announced a program on Thursday that will pay artists to create virtual programming for the public, even though its physical spaces remain closed indefinitely.
MASSCreative — a nonprofit which advocates on behalf of its members including the Boston Symphony Orchestra and Harvard Art Museums — is partnered with the MCC and is taking similar measures to guide the arts industry.
In the past week, MASSCreative began producing a weekly webinar and a social media campaign promoting the arts, according to executive director Emily Ruddock.
Ruddock said she is concerned, however, that the “diverse creative ecology” that drives Massachusetts’s cultural sector could be radically changed as a result of the pandemic.
“The creative center in Massachusetts will survive. But I think that the variety and diversity — however you want to define diversity — will be challenged,” she said.
Ruddock argued that smaller arts groups and those serving marginalized groups may not be able to weather the cultural sector’s shutdown without additional relief.
Pradhan said she believes the field will recover.
“I have every faith that this community will rebound back, but not without the help of those who can afford it,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council held a meeting Tuesday to update residents on the impact of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, as well as the city’s efforts to mitigate its effects.
Various city officials presented the most recent statistics on coronavirus cases in Cambridge, as city initiatives work to stem the impact of the crisis. Those initiatives have included introducing measures for housing stability, deploying city sound trucks that broadcast coronavirus prevention methods, and forming a senior outreach team.
Chief Public Health Officer Claude Jacob presented data on the breakdown of those infected with coronavirus, reporting a total of nearly 600 confirmed cases as of Tuesday morning, a quarter of which are among those 80 years and older.
“Of those 600 or so cases, two-thirds of those are among community residents, the other third having to do with the nursing home population in the assisted living facilities,” he said.
In order to streamline their data collection, Jacob said the city has joined the state government in its “Community Tracing Collaborative” and is an active user of the Massachusetts Virtual Epidemiologic Network, a database of infectious disease cases.
Lou Ann Bruno-Murtha of the Cambridge Health Alliance offered a “snapshot” of the situation in the city’s hospitals.
“A total of nearly 450 patients with COVID disease have been hospitalized. Eighty-one of those patients have been on ventilators,” she said. “The good news is we’ve now discharged nearly half of those patients.”
Indeed, Bruno-Murtha said hospitals are starting to see positive signs as they adapt to the challenge of limited equipment by employing various disinfection methods.
“We've been in our surge for two weeks now. I think it's clear that we hit our surge a week before Boston did,” she said. “We are starting to believe we're seeing glimmers of hope, and we are starting to feel much better about the fact that we are not going to have to ration ventilators.”
At the meeting, various city officials and community stakeholders spoke about measures to help some of Cambridge’s “most vulnerable.”
Nancy Mahan, senior vice president for Bay Cove Human Services, said her organization is focused on de-congregating the shelter services that are still operating and adapting to the closures of smaller shelters.
Mahan said that shelters have also started to test their guests for coronavirus before they can enter the facility.
“It’s really been a real affirmative commitment to people’s wellness and trying to stop the spread of this,” she said. “It’s been very much welcomed by our guests at the warming center.”
City Manager Louis A. DePasquale also announced the city has distributed almost $200,000 to 156 Cambridge residents and families through the Mayor’s Disaster Relief Fund.
“We all should be proud of the quick turnaround time in the process to approve the applications and to distribute checks,” he said.
DePasquale also commended the progress the city has made in such a short amount of time, thanking public health and human services workers.
“In less than a month, this team has been able to produce something that is really the example of what every city should try to do,” DePasquale said. “There is one other group that I think we need to recognize and that is the Cambridge residents who have donated.”
“We've already had over 1,000 Cambridge residents contribute to this fund, and it's just another example why Cambridge is the special place it is,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Student workers said they are concerned about workload protections, health care, and research opportunities during the coronavirus pandemic, given the absence of a contract between Harvard and its graduate student union.
Since negotiations first began, Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers and the University have remained in disagreement over key provisions regarding compensation, health care, and discrimination and harassment procedures. Bargaining committee member Cory W. McCartan said the pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for a contract to guarantee these protections to student workers.
“If Harvard had finished up the contract and reached agreement with us like it said it would back in January, our members would have a lot more protections right now and would be in a lot better shape to weather this crisis,” McCartan said.
After Harvard switched to remote instruction, HGSU-UAW continued to organize its members via email and engaged in one remote bargaining session with the University. The union later alleged the University asked to suspend contract negotiations for three to four weeks in order to reevaluate its finances — a claim which Harvard denied.
“The fact that they’ve stalled and delayed negotiations this whole spring has made this a lot harder for our members,” McCartan added.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an email that Harvard continues to negotiate with the union, and the two parties are scheduled to meet for a remote bargaining session with a federal mediator May 1 — two years to the day Harvard announced it would bargain with HGSU-UAW.
“Throughout this public health crisis, the University has continued to take steps with regards to its policies and resources to help our students address challenges they are facing due to the COVID-19 pandemic,” Swain wrote.
McCartan said union members were concerned about increased workload due to the new demands of online instruction. While Harvard and HGSU-UAW reached a tentative workload agreement earlier this month — setting a weekly hour limit and guaranteeing compensation for all hours worked — student workers do not currently have access to these protections because the two parties have not yet reached their first contract.
Harvard’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences announced last month it would compensate student workers for the spring 2020 semester if the limitations of remote instruction prevented them from fulfilling their employment obligations.
McCartan also said student workers are worried about access to health coverage given the risks posed by the coronavirus pandemic, particularly those who do not have University-provided health insurance.
“As this pandemic turns the whole university upside down, it leaves a lot of our workers wondering if they catch this virus, what's going to happen to them if they don't have health care, and why can’t a university with a $41 billion endowment give them basic health care,” McCartan said.
In response to the health emergency, Harvard has made adjustments to the Student Health Insurance Plan, waiving visit limits for specialist consultations and mental health through the end of July.
Still, HGSU-UAW member Jordan Howell said he believes that these provisions should have been “in place before” and not just “as an emergency measure.”
Graduate students also said the transition to online learning has disrupted their academic studies and research projects. The union recently asked Harvard to provide graduate students with a “COVID-19 bridge year” — during which students would receive full funding and health care from the University — to help them resume their research.
“It makes a lot of sense to have some kind of bridge funding year that takes away some of those concerns and allows students to continue working on their research and not be disrupted by the situation in a debilitating way,” Howell said.

Check out Flyby’s second-ever Guide to Visitas (and first-ever Guide to ~Virtual~ Visitas) here, where we’re giving you the inside scoop on Harvard student life, advice from current undergraduates and faculty, and ways to make the most of the move to all-things-remote. Stick around for an entire week of Visitas tips from our writers. Welcome, Class of 2024!
Day 1 (04/23/2020): How to Visitas
Day 2 (04/24/2020): Around Campus
Day 3 (04/25/2020): Quizitas
Day 4 (04/26/2020): Advice

Normally, you’d bring a carry-on and a backpack stuffed with the essentials as you head through Harvard’s gates for Visitas, but this year things will be... a little different. What should you pack for Virtual Visitas?
Most Important: The Zooming Device 
Pick your favorite device to Zoom from and make sure it’s always by your side. Whether it’s your laptop, desktop, phone, tablet, or iPhone 3G, keep this device ready to go so that you can Zoom into your upcoming Virtual Visitas events. Pick a cool background and get ready to ask the questions you’ve been dying to get answered. Make sure your chargers are near!
Your Harvard Merch 
The Harvard Lanyard has always been a classic Visitas staple, so why should Virtual Visitas be any different? Don’t stop there: put on your Class of 2024 shirt underneath your Harvard sweatshirt, throw on some Harvard pajama pants to match, and you’re almost ready! Just don’t forget your Harvard water bottle. At Virtual Visitas, you won’t have to worry about losing any of your precious merch, so... silver lining?
Snacks 
While free food is generally the best way to attract Harvard students to events, this Visitas you’ll have to provide your own meals and snacks. Recreate HUDS meals in your own kitchen, making sure to have some waffles for brunch on Sundays and some grilled cheese when the other options aren’t looking too good.
Good Night’s Rest 
Being stuck at home may not offer too many upsides, but being able to nap anytime, anywhere is definitely a plus. During on-campus Visitas, sleep is hard to come by — you might be locked out of the dorm you're staying in, sleeping on a dirty, cold floor, or lost on your way back from the Quad — so take advantage of this opportunity to sleep to your heart's content. Blankets and pillows have always been essential Visitas must-haves, so make sure to pack those too!
With these items in your ~virtual~ suitcase, you’re more than equipped to face Visitas — heck, that Harvard lanyard has you set for the next four years.

Among many Harvard firsts to experience during Visitas, a meal at Annenberg Dining Hall is a must. There’s no better way to meet incoming classmates than over a Veritaffle and orange juice carried on a green plastic tray. To all the prefrosh out there worried about missing the Annenberg dining experience, Flyby is here to help. Here are some easy ways you can recreate Berg food and ambiance at home. Seriously. You won’t even be able to tell the difference!
Greek Yogurt
If there’s one thing we all love about the Berg, it’s the Greek yogurt bar. With fruit (typically berries or pineapple), fancy varieties of granola, and a few different flavors of yogurt, the Berg yogurt bar is as consistent as the sunrise. Put some yogurt and your choice of toppings in a small bowl to get a small taste of your daily life at Harvard.
Lining Up
While there’s usually little to no line to go enter the Berg, Visitas is no average weekend. With hundreds of prefrosh and their families waiting to go inside, you can’t say you ate at Berg during Visitas if you didn’t stand in at least a thirty-minute line. Test your patience at home by lining up to enter your kitchen, whether alone, with your siblings, or any family member who wants to participate. Bonus points for shameless cutting!
DIY Soda Fountain 
On any given day, your home fridge probably has three to four different beverages to choose from. If it’s got more, that’s respectable. The Berg, however, is a beverage heaven. Featuring so many milk choices (chocolate, almond, and oat to name a few), tea options, juices galore, and an assortment of sodas, there’s pretty much every drink you could dream of. Try something new to drink on your next grocery store trip to prepare yourself for what’s to come!
Practice Your Harvard Intro
With your entire future class together in one place, you’ll definitely be introducing yourself many times over while sitting at Berg’s long rows of tables. Practice your Harvard introduction at home with your family so you can be as polished as ever when you finally get to campus. What’s your name and hometown? Don’t forget about that potential concentration. No pressure though. Remember to be yourself!
While missing the fine dining experience that is Annenberg (along with other famed Visitas activities) might bum you out a little right now, don’t worry too much. There’s much to look forward to in the fall when all the freshmen can experience Berg together and look at the stained glass windows on the walls as you eat a freshly made Veritaffle.

From breadmaking to lavish desserts to savory salads, lots of people are trying their culinary hand at a new meal in quarantine. But sometimes a wave of nostalgia hits you out of nowhere and all of the sudden you’re missing the too-bright lights of the Science Center and the strange but addictive flavor of Red’s Spiced Chicken. If you’re craving HUDS or just want to pretend like you’re sitting in the dhall with your friends, check out our recipes to recreate some HUDS staples below!
Seitan Pepper Sizzle:
Even with all the time on our hands to research, we’re still not sure what seitan is made of (what even is cooked wheat gluten anyways?), but the seitan pepper sizzle still remains one of our favorites!
Ingredients:
8 oz Seitan (cut into thin strips)
1 small white onion (sliced)
1 red bell peppers (sliced)
3/4 cup marinara sauce
1 clove garlic (minced)
2 tbsp Olive oil
Salt and pepper to taste
Directions:
Add olive oil to a nonstick pan. Cook the seitan and garlic with a pinch of salt on medium high heat for 4-5 minutes until the seitan is golden brown. Add onions and red bell peppers and sauté until the vegetables are tender. Add the marinara and then cook the mixture until the stir fry stops looking watery and the sauce is sticking to the seitan. Transfer into dish and then serve.
Cookie Bar:
The HUDS cookie bar is an absolute classic — it’s the guilty pleasure we all wish we had right about now. If you’re looking to recreate its magical yumminess as much as possible while you’re ~social distancing~, check out the recipe for a deliciously chewy cookie bar below!
Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour (spooned and leveled)
½ tsp salt
¼ tsp baking soda
1 12 oz. bag of semisweet chocolate chips
2 sticks unsalted butter (softened)
1 cup dark brown sugar
1 cup granulated sugar
2 large eggs
1 ½ tsp vanilla extract
Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350ºF. Grease an 8x11 baking pan with butter. Line it with parchment paper, leaving one or two inches of overhang off two of the sides (this will make removing the cookie bar easier once it’s baked). Mix the flour, salt, baking soda, and chocolate chips together until well mixed and all chocolate chips are coated with flour. Using a handheld mixer on medium-high, cream the unsalted butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, until fully incorporated. Then add the vanilla extract. Finally, add the dry ingredients and mix until just incorporated. Bake until a toothpick or knife inserted into the center comes out clean (besides maybe a bit of melted chocolate), about 30-35 minutes depending on your oven. Let cool, remove from the baking pan, cut into 24 squares and serve.
Of course, feel free to adjust these recipes to your taste or to reflect whatever you have in the house. Once you’ve made your ~HUDS treats~, we recommend eating them while sitting down and reminiscing nostalgically about being on campus. Happy cooking!
