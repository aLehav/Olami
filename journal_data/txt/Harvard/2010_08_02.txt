After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the goal of empowering library patrons to create “the information society of the future,” the University Library Council recently approved a new set of financial and infrastructural resources dubbed the Harvard Library Lab to support entrepreneurial projects that improve library functions.
Approved on July 15 by the University Library Council—a group comprised of top librarians across Harvard’s schools as well as officials of the Harvard University Library—the Library Lab will accept student and faculty proposals that create and improve library services. More of a compilation of resources than a physical laboratory, the Lab will also encourage library staff to develop their own ideas and pay them to work on their plans in lieu of some of their normal duties.
Guidelines posted on the Library Lab’s website indicate that it aims to support bottom-up projects conceived by members of the library community that can be shared in such a way that, according to the guidelines, a “reasonable investment can have substantial and lasting effects,” even if the project carries the risk of failure.
“The idea isn’t that all of these ideas are going to pay off,” said Computer Science Professor Stuart M. Shieber ’81, who is also the faculty director of the Office of Scholarly Communication, the office within the Harvard University Library that manages the Library Lab. “We want risky projects. We want people to try things. And they may not work, but that’s the entrepreneurial aspect of it.”
The Harvard Library Lab is a University-wide iteration of a similar venture at the Harvard Law School, which is behind projects such as the Harvard Library Hose, a service that tweets when an item is checked out from a library, and ShelfLife, an application that, once development is completed, could help researchers more easily navigate library collections.
Shieber said that by funding and supporting innovation that could yield more efficient operations, the Library Lab is “in line with the goals” of the Task Force on University Libraries, which released a report on Nov. 12, 2009, that proposed a restructuring of the University’s “labyrinthine” system and an increased use of common systems across Harvard’s libraries.
The funds that support the Library Lab come from Arcadia, a British foundation that made $5 million donations in 2009 to the library systems at Harvard, Yale, and the University of California, Los Angeles. The Harvard University Library has since used some of the money to process and conserve some of its 17th and 18th century collections as well as to support its Open Collections Program, which assembles online collections of information linked by a common theme.
The Office of Scholarly Communication will host a noontime discussion about the Library Lab on Aug. 12 in the Lamont Forum Room, according to Harvard University Library Notes, the library system’s newsletter.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The day before the Harvard baseball team’s playoff hopes were drowned by back-to-back losses to Dartmouth, the Crimson had given itself the chance to earn a trip to the Ivy League Championship Series.
On a sunny Saturday at O'Donnell Field, Harvard swept the first of two double headers against the eventual league-champion Big Green. The Crimson needed another sweep on Sunday to punch its ticket to the ILCS, but Harvard couldn’t follow up on its performance, surrendering nine runs in two losses.
That weekend, the one that laid the Crimson's bats to rest, showed just how close the team was to being a league championship contender. It seemed that all Harvard needed was a little more consistency, a little more luck, or a little more power. Or maybe just one more ace.
Enter Max Perlman. Recently named a Cape Cod Baseball League all star, the righty has been on a tear this summer, posting a 1.65 ERA at the all-star break in nearly 43 innings with the Wareham Gatemen. In his one inning of work at the 2010 Cape Cod Baseball League All-Star Game on July 28 held at Fenway Park, Perlman retired the side in order, facing the minimum three batters. In some ways, Perlman looks like his old self.
Back in 2007 as a freshman with the Crimson, the hurler posted a 2.91 ERA, was named to Ping!Baseball's All-Freshman third team, and was a second-team all-Ivy selection.
But because of an elbow injury he suffered heading his second season, the rising senior has not been able to match his rookie performance, missing his sophomore season and playing sparingly this past year. But when Perlman did take the mound last season, he showed signs of his old self, shutting out Cornell in a one-inning performance before four straight shutout innings against Brown in the Crimson's 9-0 win over the Bears.
But while Perlman may have shown flashes of dominance this past spring, he almost didn’t have a place to pitch this summer as the the righty's recovery from injury made him a risk for teams to sign.
"We were a little bit hesitant at first," said Tom Gay, general manager of Wareham.
But Gay, who had coached Perlman during the pitcher's last stint with the Gatemen, changed his mind after watching Harvard's game against BC. Though the Crimson lost, 7-3, Perlman demonstrated enough progress to merit a contract offer from Wareham.
"He's had unbelievable performances," Gay said. "He's been fabulous both on and off the field...That just goes to show how hard he's worked to get back...He's been a great leader for us, certainly well deserved to be picked for the all-star game."
Gay doesn't appear to be the only one who thinks so.
"There's a lot of interest in him from pro scouts," Gay said. "We have scouts out every night watching him."
Perlman hasn't been the only Harvard pitcher drawing attention to himself. The Crimson's top hurler from the 2010 season, rising junior Brent Suter, has been making a name for himself in the Great Lakes League. A first team all-Ivy selection this past spring, Suter has been named the Pitcher of the Week twice in a row this summer. The lefty boasted a 5-0 record and an ERA of 1.27, good for third in the league and the best among starters, through nearly 49 innings of work with the Hamilton Joes. During the previous college season, Suter went 4-0 in league play and led the Ivies in strikeouts with 33.
"I feel comfortable on the mound," he said. "I'm focusing on hitting my spots, developing my curveball, my change-up...My philosophy's been the same: not being tentative, going out and trying to throw strikes. It's just fortunate the numbers have been nice."
All of the Crimson's pitchers showed moments of brilliance this past season. Junior Eric Eadington also posted four wins over the course of the season. Sophomore Conner Hulse recorded seven strikeouts in the season's opener, a 9-6 win over Notre Dame, and classmate Marcus Way had the team's best ERA and a 2-1 record. But despite fleeting success, Harvard struggled to perform consistently on the mound, ending the year with a .500 league record.
The 2011 season will be a chance for the Crimson to turn things around and the last chance for Perlman and his fellow seniors. In addition to Suter, the team returns three all-Ivy selections: fellow first-team member Sean O'Hara, and honorable mentions Tyler Albright and Dillon O'Neill. The three have kept the middle of the field in check for their past three seasons, and Harvard got a boost at the plate from sophomore Jeff Reynolds. The Crimson's 2011 squad has the talent to go to the next level. And having Perlman back on the mound might be the difference Harvard needs to make the leap.
"We're all excited," Suter said. "We got a lot of confidence coming off last season. It should be a fun year."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Not many Harvard athletes can match the intensity of Chloe M. Keating when she is on the field hockey pitch—even she likens her style of play to that of a chicken with its head cut off. But in this exclusive interview, Keating reveals some of the method to her madness. Every week, The Full-Court Press will give you the sort of personal scoop that you’re not likely to hear at a typical press conference.
Name: Chloe M. Keating
Year: 2011
Position: Forward
Stats: As a junior, Keating moved to the forward position and immediately became the Crimson’s strongest offensive weapon. She started in each of Harvard’s 17 contests and led the team in scoring with 10 goals and five assists. Keating also knew how to come through in the clutch, tallying three game-winning goals.
Interrogation time.
1. Typical pre-game meal.
I typically opt to stop at Chick-Fil-A before games and do a serious number on the value menu. It's really all about balanced meals that incorporate both carbs and protein.
2. List four songs you listen to before games to get pumped up.
It's difficult to narrow it down to four. But I typically opt for  anything by Justin Bieber or any selections from the musical Joseph and  the Technicolor Dream Coat.
3. Favorite team to play against and why.
This is a more difficult question to answer, considering that rather  than doing school work on nights before games, I occasionally stalk the  equivalent of our opponent's "gocrimson" attempting to find something  embarrassing, poorly phrased, or generally not cool about individual  players. I'd hate to be the player that fuels another team's fire the  night before a game. But if forced to choose, we are taking a trip to  California this year to play Stanford and UCal. Thus, because they are  providing us with our first team-cross-country-traveling-experience,  they, equally, are my new favorite teams to play against.
4. Most ridiculous thing that has taken place in your team's locker room.
Given the public nature of [The Back Page], I likely will have to skip over the first five to six ridiculous moments that come to mind. I will say though that the locker room is more like a European club full of individuals of varying dancing skill. There's a lot of fist pumping, but that's really all I care to share.
5. Most embarrassing moment you've had on the court.
I don't typically get embarrassed that easily, but sophomore year of  high school, following a face to head collision with a player from our  rival, my front tooth (in its entirety) fell out of my mouth. Because of  the blood, the ref, my coach, and the opposing team coach rushed over,  assuming they'd find me crying, hunched over in pain, or, ideally,  silently in shock. I believe I was screaming, not necessarily words,  just yelling. And when asked if I was in pain, I answered, "I'm not in  pain, I'm just mad. I'm toothless and ugly." There may have been other  choice words thrown in between, but I've tried to black out most of the  experience. Luckily the tooth was salvaged and no major problems have  occurred since then. But unfortunately for the girl with whom I  collided, she will always be known in the Merion Mercy field hockey  community as "the tooth killer."
6. Animal that best represents your style of play and why.
I fully admit that this answer was extensively researched, and by  researched I mean, I typed in very vague adjectives (such as 'loud',  'cool', or 'weird') next to "animal" into google and skimmed through the  results. I came across this which is pretty appropriate: a chicken  nicknamed 'Miracle Mike,' who lived for nearly 18 months without his  head. To the untrained eye, forward, the position I now play, may look  like a bunch of people running around like chickens with their heads cut  off, but I do promise there are methods to our madness.
7. The most ridiculous thing you've heard a fan yell at a game you were playing in.
I'm usually too much in game mode to hear a lot when I'm on the field,  but my sister Kyle did sport a crimson snuggie during our game against  Columbia last year (similar to the one featured in this article.)
8. If you could play for another sports team at Harvard, which would it be and why?
I think being part of the fencing team would be cool, plus I think it's just a valuable skill to have in general. 
9. Position you'd play in Quidditch.
I don't know if I'm qualified to answer this question, but goalie is a pretty straightforward position in any sport.
10. If you could go on a date with any professional athlete, who would it be?
Considering that this athlete and I currently live in the same city, and especially because he is technically not legally allowed to leave, I think Mike Vick and I would really hit it off. We'd ideally just do something really low key, like take my dog for a walk.
