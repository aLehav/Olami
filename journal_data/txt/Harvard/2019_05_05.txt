After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just two days before Lizzo charmed Coachella’s audience with an impromptu flute performance, she released her major label debut, “Cuz I Love You.” Missing from Lizzo’s latest is the playful, iconic persona she showcased at Coachella, the same one she carefully crafted on earlier works. On “Cuz I Love You,” Lizzo trades in her once-distinctive voice for predictable lyrics and beats engineered by big producers. The album may be currently top of the iTunes chart, but this commercial success has nothing to do with Lizzo’s artistry and everything to do with industry peddling.
Lizzo released her debut album “Lizzobangers” in 2013. Three years later, shortly after signing with Atlantic Records, she released her first major label EP “Coconut Oil.” “Good As Hell,” one of six songs on the EP, is Lizzo at her best: simple and snappy percussion, a consoling piano riff, and a coquettish call and response with herself during the song’s chorus. “Baby, how you feelin’?” she sings, and then belts back “Feeling good as hell!” Lizzo raps and it sounds like she’s talking to a best friend. “I got a bottle of tequila I’ve been saving for you,” she says, delivering the lyric with such conviction that you can taste the bitter, smooth combination of alcohol and agave. On her 2017 single, “Truth Hurts,” Lizzo stands up an ex-boyfriend. The lyrics are as scathing as they are witty: “I just took a DNA test, turns out I’m 100% that bitch.” On “Truth Hurts,” Lizzo condescends, pleads, taunts, boasts, and feels herself while still revealing some insecurity, all while sounding like she’s having a ton of fun.
“Cuz I Love You” squeezes out Lizzo’s fun-loving energy completely. The album isn’t just major label in fact, it’s major label in sound. It’s a headache of electronic percussion, inexplicable auto-tuning of Lizzo’s powerhouse voice, and a flat message about “hashtag self-love,” not actual self-love. Lizzo’s album is a capital-P Pop production, emulating the tired spectacle of a Katy Perry song. Lizzo’s levity, keen ability to cut with a single lyric, cheerful positivity, and the way she uses her vocal prowess to claim space not just for herself but for all of her girlfriends is tragically lost on “Cuz I Love You.”
Maybe this because of the album’s reliance on stock lyrics. Lizzo always sang about female empowerment, but she used to do so with shrewd particularity. Her latest lyrics, however, are about buying her “whip” by herself, how she looks in the mirror and realizes she’s her own soulmate, and that she is, indeed, a woman who masturbates. This nod to female masturbation seems to be requisite nowadays and not only conflates womanhood with certain genitalia, but also confuses making love to yourself with actually loving yourself.
Or maybe the album falls flat because Lizzo sounds, for a lack of a better word, bored. On “Like A Girl,” the album’s second song, Lizzo delivers even the cleverest lyrics (“Only ex I care about are in my fucking chromosomes”) with lackluster. There is no wit in her voice, just posturing. What made Lizzo’s rap so great in past works wasn’t her technique, but her lack of technique. She had authenticity — a Minneapolis charm. Lizzo didn’t try to amuse us, she amused herself. She tried one new thing after another. “Like A Girl” isn’t about taking risks; it’s about synthesized vocals drowned out by lots of bass. The song is like a confetti popper: underwhelming and messy.
Similarly bland and disjointed are the album’s two collabs. On “Exactly How I Feel,” Gucci Mane delivers the lyrics “I don’t get mad, I get millions” and “Fire chains on like brrr” with tepidness, like he was dragged into the studio rather than invited. He knows the lyrics are bad, and he knows you will know too. “Tempo,” with Missy Elliott, sounds like Nicki Minaj’s “Only” took a trip inside an Easy-Bake Oven and was finished off with frosting that tastes like plastic. “Kitty cat, kitty cat, prr” and “Get your own bread, own dough” are just two of the genius lyrics Atlantic Records churned out.
“Cuz I Love You”’s only redeeming song is “Jerome,” the one moment when listeners get a break from the ear-splitting pep of the rest of the album. Lizzo provokes and pleads with Jerome. The song is both an attack against and an elegy for a guy she had high hopes for, but who ended up being a major disappointment. It’s both sad and funny. “Can’t let a pretty face distract me from business / And God as my witness, your ugly ass won’t either,” Lizzo sings with calculation. The lyrics are mean in all the right ways and Lizzo’s tone is sarcastically apologetic.
“Cuz I Love You” works best when it sticks to what is tried and true for Lizzo. On “Jerome,” she plays around again. The beat is simple — it does no more than the work required of it. And this simplicity pays off. Lizzo’s vocals and lyrics take center-stage, as they should. Hopefully, on Lizzo’s next album, they won’t be upstaged again.

Live albums are rarely as strong as their studio hits. Even the most talented artists struggle to replicate the polished and practiced tones easily manufactured in a controlled environment like a studio room. On “Homecoming: The Live Album,” Beyoncé manages to breaks this curse. With remixed instrumentals, powerful vocals, and the quintessential mixture of her most acclaimed hits, “Homecoming” is a live album that surpasses all expectations and pitfalls of its form.
One year after her iconic Coachella performance, Beyoncé dropped her live album, without advance notice, the same day her documentary “Homecoming” debuted on Netflix. The documentary follows Beyoncé’s historic headlining performance at Coachella in 2018, dubbed “Beychella.” The release of “Homecoming: The Live Album” functions as a 40[-]track compilation featuring hits like “Love On Top” and “Crazy in Love” from Beyonce’s live performance, as well as a few bonus tracks and instrumentals.
Beyoncé’s Coachella performance outshined past and present headliners, blending an adrenaline-inducing setlist accompanied by a dance routine paradigmatic of revolutionary proportion. Beyoncé is now cemented in history as the first black woman to headline the festival, and it remains the most viewed performance up to date and most watched live stream event of all time. This is a feat that Beyoncé took to heart as her performance paid tribute to historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). Beyoncé left a consequential and historically significant mark upon Coachella in a performance teeming with pride, culture, and a political commentary on divisive issues in America. The performance featured nods to historically Black Greek life organizations and Step teams. The title “Homecoming” itself is representative of the importance of homecoming events that are popular at many HBCUs — demonstrating the coming together of different communities.
This is Beyoncé’s second album release within a year, and while most of the songs are ones that audiences have heard before, they are augmented by dynamic drum lines and the indispensable message that celebrates HBCUs and their students.
The album includes instrumentation from the HBCU tribute marching band DRUMline Live. In various tracks Beyoncé adds in compelling and memorable statements commemorating black history. In an poignant rendition of “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” Beyoncé is unapologetic as she sings what is often referred to as the black national anthem. There is a second version of the same song on the album featuring her eldest daughter, Blue Ivy, singing.
In her track “Run The World (Girls),” Beyonce says, “Coachella, thank you for allowing me to be the first black woman to headline Coachella. This song is dedicated to all the incredible women that opened up the doors for me, thank you so much ladies.” The epochal track is concluded with a voiceover from Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie who is a well known Nigerian novelist speaking to the necessity of feminism: “We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller. We say to girls: ‘You can have ambition, but not too much. You should aim to be successful, but not too successful. Otherwise, you will threaten the man’” Adichie says. “We raise girls to see each other as competitors. Not for jobs or for accomplishments. But for the attention of men. Feminist: a person who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes.”
Each track presents a fresh vibe, an added rhythmic beat, and step show skits that add personality to well-known tracks that fans can’t help but love. The energetic drumline further enhances the pulsing tempo already present on the album. Additionally, the album includes modified iterations of Beyoncé’s original versions. She changes the lyrics and only performs a select few at full-length, giving an air of capriciousness to the album. Beyoncé also manages to bring her personal life into the album in the form of guest artists. Her husband Jay-Z and daughter Blue Ivy both make appearances, while Beyoncé’s fellow Destiny’s Child members Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams are featured performing their most notable hits “Say My Name,” “Lose My Breath,” and “Soldier.” J Balvin appears in Beyoncé’s rendition of “Mi Gente,” with Beyoncé acing the vocals and adjusting the ending lyrics to the original song.
“Top Off” is unfortunately short, not allowing the audience the revel in her comparably more outstand vocals. Other tracks on the album that deserve the spotlight are “Flawless / Feeling Myself,” “Run The World (Girls),” and “Formation.” The added brass and hypnotic drumline, in tandem with Beyoncé’s flawless execution of these songs and fresh take on lyrics, make these songs an essential addition to any summer playlist.
“Homecoming” is more than an album. It’s an empowering collection of songs and interludes that celebrate Beyoncé’s journey to Coachella, one that is filled with historical significance and a tenacious mindset, cementing Beyoncé’s place as one of the most influential artists of her time.

From the complex, struggling characters of “All Hail West Texas” and “Tallahassee” to the harrowing personal narrative of “The Sunset Tree” to an entire album about professional wrestling, The Mountain Goats’ frontman John Darnielle has long shown himself to be a master of the concept album. The band’s latest work, “In League With Dragons,” is no exception. According to Darnielle, the album, inspired by the role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons, “began life as a rock opera about a besieged seaside community called Riversend ruled by a benevolent wizard, for which some five to seven songs were written.”
“In League With Dragons” showcases Darnielle’s evolution as an artist, following in the style of “Goths’’ fuller, more polished sound. Whereas Darnielle’s earlier work resonates with direct urgency in its focused, image-oriented snapshots, “In League With Dragons” gives the impression of an epic. With their reflective tone, expansive instrumentals, and broad scope, the songs on ‘In League With Dragons’ reach back toward Darnielle’s past work from an older perspective, crafting a fuller picture of the desperation of his youth.
The album’s opening song, “Done Bleeding,” situates the listener in a sentimental sense of cleansing the wounds of the past. Over a heavy beat — evocative of fantasy-movie battles and sieges — Darnielle sings, “Clean the floors well, sweep and swab / Do a thorough job / Leave the old place nicer than I found it.” He expands upon this metaphor of rebirth throughout the song, delving into a nuanced exploration of how to handle potentially painful memories in the lines: “Take a picture or two / Just to remember the view / Leave a mark on the door / as an empty warning sign from one who’s gone before / But isn’t here anymore.” Due to his earlier reference to the “toxins the doctors found in me,” Darnielle seems to refer to his recovery from addiction in these lines, looking back on his earlier days as a dark time in his life that he intends to leave in the past, but not forget.
The title of the next song, “Younger,” makes explicit the thread of nostalgia that runs throughout the album. Here, Darnielle delves into his fantasy story, presumably adopting the perspective of the old wizard of Riversend. In “Younger” and in the following song, “Passaic 1975,” Darnielle frequently uses the imperative tense to pull the reader intimately into the speaker’s shoes. “Passaic 1975” adopts the perspective of Ozzy Osbourne, leader of the band Black Sabbath. The language of the line “Renew the assault on my lungs and liver” draws a parallel between Osbourne’s struggle with addiction and the album’s fantasy storyline, leading the listener to imagine the addicted body as a city under siege.
The sudden shift in scale between the grandiosity of “Clemency for the Wizard King” and “Possum by Night,” which is narrated from the perspective of a possum, offers a moment of peaceful relief in the album, mirrored by a slow piano melody for a soothing effect similar to that of “White Cedar” on The Mountain Goats’ 2012 album “Transcendental Youth,” which is also ripe with natural and religious imagery.
“Going Invisible 2” directly references The Mountain Goats’ earlier song “Going Invisible,” an outtake from the 2006 album “Get Lonely.” “Waylon Jennings Live!” adopts an upbeat, folk aesthetic to tell a story from the perspective of singer-songwriter Waylon Jennings, the last of Darnielle’s “real-world ex-wizards” on the album. From there, “Cadaver Sniffing Dog” and “An Antidote for Strychnine” lead into the final song. These two songs approach some of the darker content on the album from different angles — the disturbing lyrics of “Cadaver Sniffing Dog” are set to an uncannily upbeat tempo while “An Antidote for Strychnine” flows through slow, minimalistic instrumentals that amplify its apathetic, worn-down tone, until eventually the beat picks up and swells toward the final song.
“Sicilian Crest” closes the album with a triumphant piano melody, brass instrumentals, and a fast, rolling beat. On the podcast “I Only Listen to the Mountain Goats,” Darnielle described “Sicilian Crest” as “a quasi-fascist” song drawing attention to the exaggerated, tactical threats and empty reassurances through which tyrants are able to talk their way into power and “the only political song on the album.”
“In League With Dragons” showcases Darnielle’s development as an artist while working in close conversation with his earlier songs, weaving together threads of fantasy and realism in the type of intricate, personal story fans of The Mountain Goats have come to expect.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On April 26, Taylor Swift ushered in spring — and her newest musical era — with a dream in pastel. The combination of a multiweek Instagram countdown and a bevy of scattered hints left fans grasping at conspiracy theories and rearing for a fresh track. As cryptic as the days leading up to its the release were, “Me!” is remarkably transparent and par the course for Swift.
For an artist bent on routine reinvention, Swift offers in “Me!” no radical departure from its immediate predecessors. Featuring the layered synth introduction of “Getaway Car” and background key-smashing embraced by “This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things,” this track signals at least an attempt at sonic continuity across eras. It remains lyrically playful but superficial — “I’m the only one of me / Baby, that’s the fun of me” — in a way which remains accessible to general audiences. Swift has nailed down a production formula that clearly works.
The main difference this time around — though, if her previous track record is any indication, one should be wary of putting too much stock in forecasts based on Swift’s early releases — is in tone. To say that “Me!” oozes theatricality is an understatement. Underpinned by a rapt snare drumline, the song demands performance with a full marching band as support. “Me!” earns its title not because it provides introspection in an age of overwrought personal projects, but rather because it drowns out narrative with pith in a bid for wide attention, if not appeal. Whereas Swift’s last era avoided the press and offered dampened releases, the latest track hints at a bounding return to maximalism.
Though Swift’s choices are unsurprising, it is not true that they all make sense. The bridge, rife with elementary exclamations like “Spelling is fun!” and “You can’t spell ‘awesome’ without ‘me’” is dumbfounding. Swift may have entered her political era, but a suddenly developed penchant for student literacy seems unlikely. Also rather strange is the addition of a featured artist. Though Brendon Urie from Panic! at the Disco provides nice balance to the duet, an ode to self-importance that by design shares the spotlight seems unorthodox.
Fans of Swift should know that the winter of her career (if one can call it that) has passed, spring is here, and “Me!” stays the course. It’s bright, catchy, and as much of a pivot towards the lowest common denominator as need be to capture the large audiences the performer is so fond of. The only useful benchmark for one of Swift’s lead singles is whether it could conceivably fill an arena with delight. As always, the answer is yes.

“NO PUNK TIME,” reads the Facebook event for Record Hospital Festival, referring to the tendency of punk shows to start well after their advertised time. True to its word, Record Hospital, Harvard Radio Broadcasting (WHRB)’s indie and punk department, began each night of the two-day festival promptly at 6:30 p.m., ushering festival-goers out of the Elks Lodge in Central Square by 11 p.m.
The annual festival put on by Record Hospital is not only a celebration of punk and indie music, but also a way for Harvard students to interact with the greater Boston and Cambridge community. Proceeds from the event went to the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center (BARCC), a local organization, which provides support services to survivors of sexual assault and harassment. The venue, Elks Lodge, was a Cambridge locale tucked away on Bishop Allen Drive.
Anand R. Bradley ’19, a member of Record Hospital, said this year’s festival featured more Boston and Cambridge bands than past years have. “Sometimes we have bands come from out of town but this year we’ve had a lot of really local bands, which is really cool,” Bradley said.
Bradley also highlighted that the festival was advertised to not only Harvard students, but also to the general public. “The event is a time where members of the community can interact with Harvard students around music, which is one of the goals of the Record Hospital. We’re trying to open up Harvard to local music and to local bands,” Bradley said.
Of the seventeen acts the festival featured, eight musicians performed on Saturday night. Lady Pills, a three-woman band from Boston, kicked off the night with music they describe as “loud enya rock with psychedelic disco magic.” Dump Him, a group of self-described “gay punks from Massachusetts,” brought their pop punk tunes next.
Sophia M. Higgins ’21, a Harvard undergraduate and Crimson magazine editor, performed her experimental “noise project” entitled “Frigid." The project included field recordings, FM synthesis, guitar loops, and found objects, according to Higgins’s website. As Higgins performed, two young women sat down and whipped out sketchbooks, their pens moving as slowly or as frantically as the notes that Higgins made on her soundboard.
Fans made the trek to Boston to hear the Philadelphia-based Band Trot play the festival. William M. Miller, a student at the University of Pennsylvania, described himself as a huge fan of the band. He’s been following them since 2012.
“They’re a Philly band, and I’m a Philly guy,” Miller said. “I came down so I could see them play.”
Kati N. Kirsch, a student at the Pratt Institute, also travelled to Cambridge from New York City.
“I’m having a great time,” Kirsch said. “There’s way more of a variety of acts than I was expecting, which is really cool.”

Replying to Ethan J. Fields’ ’22 request on Facebook for band members, Julian A. Miltenberger ‘22, drummer, Rob S. R. Walker ‘22, guitarist, and Benjamin J. Dreier ‘22, bassist, joined Fields, guitarist to form the band Extra Extra. Just this year, Extra Extra publicized presence on campus with a recent YardFest performance. The four freshmens’ plans for their band include releasing their own EP and continuing to perform on and around campus. Three members of Extra Extra sat down with The Harvard Crimson to chat about their newly founded band and their plans for the near future.
The Harvard Crimson: How did your musical endeavor begin?
Ethan J. Fields: Before Extra Extra, we were just little fetuses kicking around, drifting in this empty void. We all played instruments.
Benjamin J. Dreier: I started playing upright bass, like classical music bass, in fourth grade. I played that for a long time until senior year, when I picked up bass guitar.
EF: I’ve been playing instruments casually all throughout middle school and high school. I always wanted to form a band and dominoes started falling and now it's a Rube Goldberg machine.
Rob S. R. Walker: I started since I was pretty young, my parents took me to piano lessons until I was six and then I picked up some instruments like trumpet, accordion, and then guitar in grade nine.
THC: How did you start Extra Extra?
EF: A while back, during the fall, I just put up a Facebook message looking for people to start a band. Rob and I connected there and then we had been just kind of playing casually with revolving musicians through word of mouth. Then we found Ben, and then Julian just kind of hopped on board.
THC: Have you been recording or performing?
BD: We have been performing places and we had a gig at Yard Fest. We had a gig at the Signet Society a few weeks ago. We're planning on performing next week. As for recording, we have some wisdom plans for that as well. Tentative plans for recording an EP pretty soon.
EF: We're hoping after classes to get together and just do it straight out of the dorm, kind of DIY for the originals that we've been playing live so it should be fun and organic. A nice time to hang with the boys.
THC: Where do you see this progressing at Harvard, beyond Harvard?
EF: Hopefully it's something that we can seriously pursue over the next three years. We're doing concerts around campus, and starting to do more originals and recordings. Then, potentially get into a label or staying independent. That’s something we have to adjust to down the road. We want to play tunes at the end of the day.
THC: How did you feel performing at YardFest?
EF: Pretty good. It was actually so surreal to just get up on stage. Everything is a blur. I could not see past three feet. Bazzi obviously stole the show, so it was tough to just be in his presence. But I think we held our own.
BD: I think it was cool. I think we had really good audience engagement because the kind of music that we play lends itself well like that kind of setting. It gets people bumpin’.
THC: What would you define your kind of music as?
EF: Indie. Whatever that means these days. As long as we’re putting out stuff that sounds original and fresh. We don’t like to stay confined to anything. It's guitar music but who knows, that could change.
THC: Are there any bands or artists that you guys try to emulate in your music?
BD: Car Seat Headrest has a similar vibe.
EF: I really like The 1975, personally. I like their image and that's key these days with social media. We are Car Seat Headrest meets The 1975 meets Weezer meets Smash Mouth. We're kind of in that group. Also, Paul Simon.
THC: How do you think concerts like YardFest are important for student engagement and creating an inclusive space on Harvard’s campus where student artists can perform and show their artistic capabilities? What is the importance of that to you and do you hope to pursue that more in your three years to come?
EF: Yeah, I think it's fantastic, especially with a group like Maybe There's Life because commonly you don't associate hip hop with academia, so it’s shifting the narrative. Creating those spaces, like YardFest, where students can share their art is really cool. Also, there's no stakes and everyone's there just socializing. We need that, otherwise it’s a very high-pressure environment.
THC: What is one sentence or statement that sums up your band?
BD: We
RW: Are
EF: An
BD: Experience 
RW: That
EF: You
BD: Will
RW: Adore
EF: Passionately.
