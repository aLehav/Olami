After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past Monday, the Office of Career Services hosted a panel on careers in the military. Graduate students who had served in the Marine Corps, Navy, Army, and Air Force spoke to current students, fellow military alumni, and military policy experts. The popularity of this event attests to the military’s heightened role on campus, after President Drew Faust welcomed back the Reserve Officer Training Corps earlier this year. This was a highly positive move, as the new policy reversed an antiquated antagonism against the military and better reflects where the University stands on the institution at this point in its history. In this context, the panel—and the military’s presence at other career fairs this year—reflects career counseling at its best, providing students with the resources to explore a variety of professional options.
The foremost goal of allowing on-campus information sessions or recruiting by any group, be they a non-profit, an investment bank, or the military, is to expose Harvard students to career options they do not fully understand. Indeed, whether freshman or senior, it is very difficult for students to conceive what working in a particular field is actually like, without the benefit of a family member in this area or a summer internship. Little things, like how much work one takes home, how typical contracts and benefits are structured, or whether the supply of jobs is concentrated in a particular geographic area, are issues that many students do not even know are important to investigate. In this vein, information sessions can be the make-or-break factor in whether students choose to seriously consider a particular field.
In this context, given that the military has not had as strong a presence on campus in past years, informational and recruiting events are very positive. The military is a career which many students may not have seriously considered or known very much about, so it is good that Harvard students learn the details of military careers so they can pursue one if they so choose. Thus, allowing military recruiting and including them in job fairs is entirely in line with the missions of OCS and Harvard as a whole, to prepare students for whatever career fulfills their individual passions.
However, we think that beyond the general benefits of giving students more options, more Harvard students entering the military will have positive effects on it as an institution. The military is lacking many progressive policies—for example, transgender individuals are currently not allowed to serve. We believe that changes to the military's culture and policy which make it more progressive and inclusive—like the recent repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell, a policy which prevented soldiers from being openly gay—are more likely to happen if more Harvard graduates, who are generally more liberal then the rest of society, enter the military and gain a tangible stake in its future.
Furthermore, the military has traditionally drawn from a specific demographic: lower socioeconomic classes and minorities (although that may be changing). Harvard students as a whole tend to come from a higher socioeconomic class and be more representative of the US as a whole racially, so it is likely that more Harvard students entering the military will serve to make the military's demographics at least somewhat more representative. We recognize that the number of recruits Harvard will send to the military will be only a very small portion of the number of soldiers recruited each year, but we nonetheless think that even a small change in demographics is laudable.
We would caution, however, that as Harvard is a private and increasingly international institution, it would be unacceptable to give the US Military, or indeed any recruiter, an advantage over other employers. Harvard students should be exposed to many options, and every employer should be allowed to make their case, but none should be permitted a larger presence or louder voice then the others, as this could warp student's decisions. It is not the University's place to choose careers for their students, but rather to set the tone they wish, and then allow students their choice of career.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Oakland burns and Republican pundits and politicos gear up for a new conservative counterrevolution, it’s important to remember that it was not too long ago when the critique du jour of Occupy Wall Street was its lack of a cohesive policy platform (never mind the fact that this is in fact among the most trite of the commentariat’s stock criticisms of every protest movement—including the Tea Party). These days, however, one hears less of this line of argument—inane as it was—as the allegation of choice seems to have shifted to one of subversive class warfare.
The ostensibly Democratic pollster Douglas E. Schoen ’74, for example, condemned the movement as one that “reflects values that are dangerously out of touch with the broad mass of the American people—and particularly with swing voters who are largely independent and have been trending away from the president since the debate over health-care reform. The protesters have a distinct ideology and are bound by a deep commitment to radical left-wing policies…it comprises an unrepresentative segment of the electorate that believes in radical redistribution of wealth, civil disobedience and, in some instances, violence.”
That Schoen, a “Democratic” Fox News analyst who opposes Obamacare and has earnestly suggested that President Obama should not seek reelection, was able to arrive at this conclusion on the basis of a poll that found that only four percent of Occupiers wished for the “radical redistribution of wealth”—less than the five percent favoring a flat tax—is a remarkable achievement. Somehow, Schoen interpreted a poll in which only three percent of Occupiers express opposition to capitalism—as opposed to the nearly 80 percent decrying the influence of special interests, stagnant middle class wages, partisanship, unemployment, income inequality, corruption, and entrenched bureaucracy—as evidence of pervasive opposition to the free market.
There is no denying that Occupy Wall Street is a leftwing movement—zero of the respondents to Schoen’s poll identified as Republican. But Schoen’s hysterical hyperbole demonstrates the fallaciousness of the widespread paranoia over the mirage of class warfare that has infected Republican partisans and centrist Democrat hacks alike. This irrational victim mentality has also swept up in its tide a fair number of the supposed casualties of this imaginary conflict—the wealthy.
Black Entertainment Television founder Robert Johnson, for example, told Fox News Sunday that “You don't get people to like you by attacking them or demeaning their success. You know, I grew up in a family of 10 kids, first one to go to college, and I've earned my success. I've earned my right to fly private if I choose to do so. And by attacking me it is not going to convince me that I should take a bigger hit because I happen to be wealthy.”
In a similar vein, David Moore wrote in the Wall Street Journal that a panhandler’s rejection of his one-dollar donation proved that “[Obama’s] incendiary message has now reached the streets. His complaints that rich people must ‘pay their fair share’ have now goaded some of our society's most unfortunate, including one who felt compelled to refuse money because it was not enough.”
In 1945, the top marginal income tax rate was 94 percent. In 1981, it was 69.13 percent. Today, it is 35 percent, and President Obama would like for it to return to the 39.6 percent rate preceding the two rounds of temporary tax cuts enacted under President Bush. This, by the way, would constitute a smaller increase than that made under President Clinton, who hiked the top marginal rate to 39.6 percent from the lower baseline of 31 percent; no one today is still accusing Clinton of class warfare or labeling the 1990s as an era particularly hostile to the wealthy.
Granted, it is understandable why wealthy individuals who never supported President Obama might balk at the prospect of tax hikes. The president, after all, also favors limiting itemized deductions for families with taxable income of $250,000 or more a year and ending tax breaks for oil companies, corporate-jet owners and investment-fund managers—policies that have little practical—as opposed to political—purpose. However, it is jarring to see wealthy supporters of Obama from 2008—including much of Wall Street—change their minds now; why did they choose to act in their self interest in 2011 and not three years ago?
Political optics are also the prime motivation for retiring the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, for the bulk of the Bush-era structural deficit in fact stems from the Bush tax cuts for the middle class. Somehow, this fact did not seem to bother wealthy Obama supporters in 2008. How is it that Obama—whose platform has not changed in any substantive way from 2008, has now become, in the words of New York Times columnist and ex-Obamaphile David Brooks, “the populist fighter, the scourge of the privileged class”? Does targeting loopholes for corporate jets truly constitute an assault on success?
Since President Obama’s inauguration, the wealthy and their apologists have adopted a siege mentality and think themselves latter-day John Galts. They behave like martyrs in an era of unprecedented corporate profits and income inequality. Yes, soaking the rich will neither balance the budget nor restore prosperity—but a return to Clinton-era tax rates and closing symbolic loopholes hardly constitutes soaking the rich. And if a protest of Wall Street’s unpunished complicity in the financial crisis, a panhandler’s ingratitude, and a president’s tenor are what now pass for class warfare, then the bar for class warfare has been set quite low indeed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Punch season is over, but discussions about the role of final clubs on campus are likely to linger. Over the course of the past few weeks, The Crimson has released a number of editorials on the subject of single sex clubs; the debate may grow stronger as the Greek system continues to push for Harvard recognition, raising questions about the place of the final clubs as well.
These issues are well worth discussing, for the final clubs are the most visible example of sexism on campus. Think of it this way: About $22 million worth of property, sitting in the middle of Harvard, between the houses and across from dorms, is inaccessible to women of the college. If you come to Harvard as a man, you’ll have a chance, however small, to gain entry to a private space and a large network, one that will form the core of your social life and might help you get a job. If you come to Harvard as a woman, you’ll only make it through the door in heels and a short skirt.
Yet, even by people who recognize these inequalities, the issue is often dismissed as unimportant or too difficult to address. There’s the “boys will be boys” line—mentioned by both men and women—that people of each gender benefit from time secluded from the other. Proponents of this argument will inevitably point to the female final clubs, although these, smaller and without property, are hardly equal to the male-only clubs. (I should mention here that I am a member of the Signet society, a coed arts and letters society at Harvard).
These responses are in a large part reflective of the inequality itself. Reporting on this article, I heard explanations that veered into the absurd: If men punched women, they’d only pick the hot chicks they wanted to hook up with. If you allowed women in clubs, there’d be twice the legacies, and therefore less diversity. Listening to these claims enumerated, even by those who did not believe them, I felt a deep sense of dismay. We are expected to come into Harvard as peers in excellence; we graduate with the same diploma. How could it be that the University allows for a space for such thoughts to go by uncontested?
But by far the biggest response, and the one I’d like to challenge here, is that there’s nothing to be done. Final clubs have been around forever, and will stay that way in their current state. “You are about fifteen years too late!” said Douglas W. Sears, Graduate Board President of the Fox, when I called to ask about the push to go coed.
And so I’ve listed a few points to address:
I’ve often been told that the singlesex nature of clubs is to be attributed to the graduate boards that own them. It’s true that in past cases, some graduate boards have influenced the nature of the clubs. When the Fly voted to go coed in 1993, the vote was delayed by the graduate board and eventually overturned. And boards have put procedures in place to make a coed majority unlikely to be successful unless it is sustained. At the Spee, a majority must vote for several consecutive years to make a change, according to Arthur C. Anton Jr., its graduate board president. (For those curious about the make-up of these boards, a fairly comprehensive list of graduate board members can be found  on the website of Perspective Magazine).
In this case, Harvard students can take a cue from Yale, where graduate board members who opposed women joining the secret society Skull and Bones were eventually overturned after a committed campaign by undergraduates.
Or consider the attempts laid out by last year’s Students for Safe Social Spaces. This group sought to look at social spaces at Harvard from all angles, and has tried to get the University to discuss publically the final clubs in a statement, according to their website.
Some of their suggestions are well worth support: The University instructs students about alcohol before they even set foot on campus, all the while realizing that Harvard itself will not give alcohol to underage students. But about final clubs, they are completely silent. Why not talk with students about punch, as the group has suggested—at both Freshman Week and through sophomore advising?
In addition, I share the group’s concern that the differences between events that happen on campus and those that happen "off" it are not always clear, especially when they relate to issues of alcohol consumption and assault. Jeff Neal, a Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesman says that Harvard urges “full participation” in Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors and The Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response trainings by final clubs. But shouldn’t all students be more fully informed about the difference between partying on or off campus?
We come to Harvard hoping to learn about ourselves, find our interests and leave ready to change the world. We can start this by addressing those that govern our day-to-day life.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I type a very Indian name into the Google search bar at my office computer in Bangalore: "Umang Sabarwal." Upon hitting “enter,” I notice my access to this search has been denied—pornographic content is not allowed in the workplace.
The office firewall has misconstrued the website content of my Google search, misinterpreting the significance of "slut," "whore," and dozens of other, more sexually explicit words left by angry viral Indians venting on online discussion boards. The name I had entered, “Umang Sabarwal,” belongs not to a porn star, but to the nineteen-year-old Delhi University student who felt it relevant to bring Toronto’s SlutWalk, a protest against rape culture, to the streets of India’s capital.
The protest has spread to more than seventy-five cities worldwide, standing against the blame-the-victim attitude found in all the cultures represented by these metropolises. Arising as a response to a Toronto cop who announced, “Women should stop dressing like sluts in order not to be victimized,” thousands have since taken to the streets in their lingerie, driven to make the point that there is no excuse for rape.
When Umang Sabarwal announced a SlutWalk in New Delhi in July, the idea behind the demonstration was lost in translation. Like my workplace firewall, many Indians processed SlutWalk at its superficial face value—the fishnet leggings seen on TV were taken exactly as what they stood against. Indian feminists argued that the irony behind the SlutWalk, that participants dress provocatively because they are not asking for it, would fall on deaf ears. But if feminists are angered that India’s males will wrongly interpret cleavage as an open invitation, they cannot resign themselves to accepting such a simplified interpretation of SlutWalk. Though many argue that SlutWalk is only an effective protest in Western society, it is also applicable in India.
Older feminists counter that it is not culturally relative to transpose SlutWalk onto Indian streets. Many think the issue of dress as peripheral in a country stricken by female infanticide and dowry deaths. More still have derided the protest as something that only the upper echelon of society would engage in. The feminist organizers of Delhi University responded that victims of sexual violence do not arrive in cookie-cutter shapes to the police precincts. They range from college students clad in jeans to village migrants wrapped in saris. Acknowledging that social media like Twitter and Facebook, which first made Delhi SlutWalk popular, would be lost on the millions unable to access these platforms, they engaged in street skits for those who could not read. They staged flash mobs throughout the city with the purpose of demonstrating the prevalence of the bystander affect. They created a physical forum for open dialogues held to discuss gender stereotypes and inequality. They translated SlutWalk and renamed it “Besharmi Morcha,” the Walk of Shamelessness, lest the English word “slut” be lost on the Indian people. Though a young, educated demographic drove the protest, their rallying cry didn’t concern the right to dress like the cast of Friends. Victimization is apparent in the smallest of villages, and victimization is apparent in the wealthiest of city circles.
Still, opponents added to this criticism, viewing the protest as a demonstration to assert Westernization and the loosening of cultural mores. They argued that Indian men too are held to societal constraints, so scantily-clad women should not so freely parade around their sacred motherland. But when a city is deemed the “rape capital” of India with an incident occurring once every eighteen hours, when the number of reported rapes has increased by 678 percent in the past 30 years, and when the police are notorious for taking minimal to no action in the prosecution of acts of sexual violence, it becomes clear that these societal constraints are not actually so constraining. Lewd comments on the street, groping on the metro trains, and the persistence of stalkers are common experiences shared by many of the capital’s women. As the heavy coverage by the media shows, SlutWalk was revolutionary in agitating against the complacency with the patriarchal status quo—which discourages open dialogue regarding male and female relations, historically pushing it under the rug.
Before the event took place, Indians were afraid of the indecency that these young feminists would transpose onto the public sphere in the name of women’s rights. 700 people came out to protest on that last day in July, mostly clad in jeans and a t-shirt—increasingly growing as the preferred choice of dress for Delhi’s women. Disappointment reverberated in the media as photographers scurried towards the lone woman in a pink tank top. With the hope of capturing as much flesh as they could, she was their best bet.
Although they dressed less extremely than their international counterparts, the participants embodied the visceral transformation that New  Delhi is currently experiencing. The organizers reinterpreted a more culturally relevant SlutWalk for their city. In this way, they took a critical step in appropriating the fight against harassment into their own hands.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Interested in politics since she was young, Katharine A. Kirk ’15 chose to spend her gap year interning for Senator John Kerry on Capitol Hill. Though she was 18 and in Washington during the 2010 midterm elections, Kirk only registered to vote this fall on Study Card Day.
“I felt terrible,” Kirk says about not registering to vote last year.
Despite saying that she was embarrassed last November, her experience on the Hill gave her a better understanding of working in politics.
“What I gleaned from my experience in D.C. is that I don’t want to do that as a career, but I still want to be involved somehow,” Kirk says.
Now enrolled at Harvard, Kirk looks forward to attending more events at the Institute of Politics, getting involved in President Obama’s re-election campaign, and voting.
“It’s just hard with my school work,” Kirk says. “Being here, I’ve not read a newspaper in so long. I’m in a little bubble. So I need to work on that.”
Though Kirk and other freshmen have been participating in politics for years—writing letters to local representatives and leading peers in school government—there are still many freshmen, and upperclassmen, who are not registered or who will not vote. To combat this disconnect between activism and voting, the IOP has partnered with TurboVote, a new online voter registration service. Next week, the Nov. 8 general election will provide the first opportunity for many of these newly registered students to vote.
A POLITICAL CAMPUS
Each fall, political groups on campus attract hundreds of freshmen interested in government and policy.
Each semester, the Institute of Politics registers around 350 students as members. The largest percentage of these students is freshmen. This year, freshmen also make up half of the students participating in the IOP’s competitive liaison program, in which students assist the IOP resident fellows, according to IOP Student President Jeffrey F. Solnet ’12.
“A lot of people come to Harvard because of the Institute of Politics,” Solnet says. “There’s an immediate attraction if you’re interested in politics. You hear that the President of Chile is going to be in the forum. You’re going to go.”
Harvard freshmen join not only the IOP, but also the Undergraduate Council, the Harvard Republican Club, and the Harvard College Democrats.
Ian D. Lundberg ’15 joined Harvard College Act on a Dream, an organization dedicated to immigration reform, and recently attended their Ivy League Immigrants’ Rights Coalition Summit. He has been interested in politics since joining the Sierra Club, the U.S.’s largest grassroots environmental organization, when he was 12.
Kirk is one of many Harvard freshmen who have also participated in politics off campus.
Megan E. Reynolds ’15 interned on the Hill for Nancy Pelosi’s office the summer before her junior year. Though she is taking this semester off from extracurricular activities to acclimate herself to college life, Reynolds says she plans to comp the IOP in the spring.
“It’s really refreshing how many people here are actively involved in politics or are so interested and educated about political issues,” Reynolds says.
While Reynolds is registered to vote, she does not plan on voting until next year.
“Since I haven’t voted on anything yet, I want to wait for the presidential election,” Reynolds says.
EXERCISING YOUR RIGHT
Despite the number of active political groups at Harvard and other colleges around the country, interest in the issues does not always translate into voting in elections.
According to the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement, only 20.9 percent of eligible voters aged 18 to 19 voted in the 2010 midterm election.
Reed R. Snyder ’15 cited time as one reason why few students, particularly freshmen, might not register or vote.
“Harvard is a place where so much is expected of you in so many different areas, it doesn’t leave a whole lot of time to step back and think about big picture things like national politics,” Snyder says.
A varsity swimmer with 25 hours of practice a week, Snyder has not joined any political clubs this semester. However, Snyder is registered to vote and stays informed about current events and the 2012 primaries.
Alexander A. Wirth ’15, who has joined two IOP committees and participates in Harvard Model United Nations, has made youth engagement a central focus of his political activism.
Wirth blogs for the Huffington Post, is a fellow at the Forum for Youth Investment, and he chairs the Youth Working Group for the U.S. National Commission to UNESCO.
“What I advocate for is trying to get young people included in a more substantial way, so that instead of just being talked at, they are talked with,” Wirth says.
Solnet says that approximately 80 percent of Harvard undergraduates are registered to vote. According to Laura J. Simolaris, the IOP’s director of national youth engagement, 25 percent of students who registered on Study Card day this year did so in Massachusetts.
“People don’t feel like they are members of the Cambridge community,” Solnet said. “It’s the Harvard bubble effect.”
Choosing where to register to vote is a personal decision. Wirth says that choosing to register locally rather than in one’s home state depends on where students are from.
“New Mexico is a battle ground state,” Wirth said. “My vote can have an impact there. If you’re from a state that is heavily Democratic or Republican with uncontested races then you should consider registering in Massachusetts.”
Even students who chose to register locally did not necessarily exercise their right to vote.
Last year, out of the three Cambridge wards in which Harvard students are the majority of voters, only three students voted, and they all lived in the Yard, Solnet says.
Wirth recommends that students pay attention to how politics relates to issues they care about and added that registering anywhere is vitally important as many elections are determined by a couple hundred votes.
“That’s the amount of people sitting here in Annenberg,” Wirth said at an interview during lunch one Thursday afternoon. “For us not to care right now is irresponsible as this is the country we are going to inherit.”
AS EASY AS NETFLIX
Recognizing low student voting rates, the IOP began to provide voter registration forms on Study Card Day in 1999. This year, the IOP partnered with a new voter registration service called TurboVote, which allows individuals to register quickly and efficiently online.
Once users have signed up, TurboVote tracks their election calendars and can send them completed voter-registration forms or vote-by-mail applications as well as pre-stamped, pre-addressed envelopes to their local election boards. TurboVote also sends email and text reminders to users to mail in forms, absentee ballots, or to vote in person.
TurboVote founder Seth E. Flaxman conceived of the idea for TurboVote while attending the Harvard Kennedy School. According to Flaxman, approximately 50 percent of Americans vote in presidential elections, around 40 percent in midterm elections, and as low as 10 or 20 percent in local elections or primaries.
After working in New York, Flaxman moved to Cambridge in 2009 and realized that he had missed a number of elections and had not re-registered to vote.
“I wondered, how come it’s so much easier for me to rent a movie than participate in democracy?” Flaxman says. “Voting doesn’t fit the way we live and it especially doesn’t fit the way students live. Students are moving around constantly. So to build a voter registration and voting system that fits the way students live it has to act more like Netflix.”
Lundberg was already registered when he submitted his study card, but said that the process seemed easy to use and was a great idea. Noah F. Greenwald ’15 forgot to turn in his study card that afternoon but registered through TurboVote.org on his own.
“Every year, freshmen are the group that should be registering to vote,” Flaxman says. “I would love to see every Harvard undergrad using TurboVote to stay registered and receive help voting by mail or voting in person after four years on Harvard’s campus. It might take four years to get there because the freshman class is usually the most intense about taking care of this.”
To improve TurboVote’s user accessibility, Flaxman is working with Solnet and Greenwald to recruit a Harvard student to code a mobile-friendly version of TurboVote. Greenwald said the programming might count towards a CS50 student’s final project. Solnet hopes the program will be completed this month so that it can be tested and implemented throughout the year.
Though TurboVote is still in its early stages, it has made an impact on Harvard students.
“I know a lot of people registered through [TurboVote] who wouldn’t have otherwise,” Greenwald says. “I don’t think I would’ve, especially freshman year. As a Harvard student who wasn’t working on the voter registration group, I don’t think I would have been motivated enough to do it.”
Greenwald will join many other freshmen who will vote for the first time next week. Starting in January, registered freshmen can vote in state caucuses and primaries. The class of 2015 will then have the opportunity to vote in the 2012 presidential election.
“We’re at a really big decision point,” Wirth said. “Right now is not time for apathy. It’s a time for action.”

New Director of the Chinese Language Program Jennifer L. C. Liu has named fostering a greater sense of community among associated faculty members as her major priority since taking the helm of the program this fall.
Liu’s predecessor Shengli Feng, who departed last May for a tenure-track position at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, built the program into one of the nation’s most distinguished.
“This program has always had great teachers, but since [Feng] left many of them have felt like they don’t have any organized channels to communicate,” she said. “I have tried to create more venues for our instructors to discuss overall course objectives and to discuss student progress.”
In addition to planning a revamp of the program website, Liu created a program-wide newsletter as a central means to convey information to faculty members.
Calling upon her nineteen years of experience at Indiana University, Liu said she also hopes to extend the cohesion among faculty members to improve student satisfaction within the program.
“In a few years all of our material will be more systematic,” Liu said.
Liu, whose research interests lie primarily in language pedagogy, would also like to put more emphasis on students’ oral and written communication abilities. Proposed changes include the restructuring of course assignments for upper-level students to encourage interaction with Chinese scholars or other fluent students.
“I would like to increase the number of authentic opportunities that students have to practice their language skills,” she said.
In spite of concerns that arose last spring as a result of a financial landscape of reduced hiring and salary freezes, Liu was chosen to fill Feng’s vacated post.
At the time of his departure, East Asian Languages and Civilization Department Chair Wilt Idema acknowledged that it was “extremely important” that this position be filled for the University’s Chinese language offerings.
Chinese language preceptor Qiu Yu Wang, who has worked with both Liu and Feng as an introductory-level course head, acknowledged that Feng’s departure was a great loss to Harvard. However, Wang commended the new director for her vision for the program.
“[Feng] was a great loss for the program, but it is great to have a new competent director to bring this program to a new stage,” she said. “[Liu] has a lot of ideas and is someone that I am very confident will bring them to fruition.”
Liu said that she was inspired to make these changes from the problems that she encountered as program head at Indiana University.
In the meantime, however, she acknowledges that one of the most difficult aspects of her transition has been adjusting to her new life outside of the office.
“The greatest difference [from my previous position] has been the life aspect,” she said. “Before, it took me ten minutes to get to work, but the traffic is horrible here.”

Jon L. Noronha ’11 and Eric N. Hysen ’11 have invented a tool to track the calories, fat, protein, and carbohydrates in food by taking pictures. “PlateMate,” as the tool is called, allows users to take pictures of their meals and send them to other people who estimate calorie counts and nutritional information with great accuracy.
The people making the estimates are part of Amazon Mechanical Turk—a crowdsourcing community—and are referred to as Turkers. They are online workers who are paid a few cents for each short task they complete. In this case, Turkers examine PlateMate photographs and provide calorie estimates.
When testing PlateMate, Noronha and Hysen found that the results “overestimated calories by about 7 percent, compared to 5 percent to 9 percent for the best experts.”
According to Noronha, when PlateMate was used by students at Harvard, “a majority preferred our system and found it more accurate and easier to use than doing their own estimates.” The PlateMate results were also much more accurate than those of the students’ personal food diaries.
Noronha said there are two reasons why the system is appealing.
“First, it’s way easier because all you have to do is take a picture, without painstakingly recording or memorizing what you ate and looking up nutrition facts” he said. “Second, it’s less biased. Prior studies show that people seriously underestimate their own eating, remembering their portions as smaller and healthier than they really were. Having a third party do the estimate removes that bias.”
According to Noronha, if the questions are structured properly, results can be received within minutes.
Hysen and Noronha noted that the development process has been difficult. Early on in the testing, the pair had trouble convincing Turkers to complete PlateMate tasks truthfully. At first, they asked Turkers to both identify the types of food in the photographs and then determine the nutritional value of the meal by searching a database.
“We found that the results from that were very bad because we asked workers to do two things at once,” Hysen said. “We replaced the single task by a two-step process where one set of workers identifies what’s in the box, and another set matches those items to the food database, and got much better results.”
PlateMate arose as a final project for a computer science course last fall, according to Hysen. Currently neither Hysen nor Noronha are working on the project, but Hysen said they “hope [their] research inspires someone to turn this into a publicly-available product. Making a smartphone app would be one of the first steps if that happens.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Senior political advisers for opposing campaigns in the 2000 presidential election spoke frankly to students at Kirkland House on Thursday about what they did to undermine each other’s campaigns with political ads.
Mark McKinnon, former senior adviser to President George W. Bush, and Thomas A. “Tad” Devine, former senior adviser to Vice President Al Gore ’69, shared war stories from the campaign.
The talk, moderated by national political correspondent for the Washington Post Dan Balz, was part of the Harvard Institute of Politics’ “Conversations with Kirkland.”
Event coordinator Eric P. Lesser ’07 said that he chose McKinnon and Devine not only because they are two of the most experienced political ad-makers in the world, but also because they have worked on opposing sides.
Showing several video clips of historical political ads, Balz drew attention to an ad made by McKinnon that focused on Kerry’s inconsistent voting. The ad showed Kerry saying that he voted for one issue before he voted against it.
Cringing at the clip, Devine took responsibility for Kerry’s gaffe, saying that the campaign had stretched Kerry too thin at the time.
“We gave them a lot of amo, and we paid the price for it,” Devine said. “Good ad makers are going to make you pay a price when you serve it up to them.”
Despite a competitive history between the two men, the talk was not combative. Both McKinnon and Devine expressed their admiration for each other. McKinnon attributed this respect to their shared rationale for doing what they do.
“We both recognize that there are good people on both sides of the aisle,” McKinnon said after the event. “We’re really in it for the same reasons.”
Devine said that an effective political ad must, above all, be memorable, impactful, and deliver a message that will resonate with the audience. Political ads, Devine said, are an opportunity to deliver a memorable, and possibly emotional, campaign message to a large audience.
Both former advisers also emphasized the importance of an ad’s credibility. In a political atmosphere dominated by negative ads, McKinnon said, it is increasingly important to test the credibility of political ad content today.
“You want to plant the seed of great doubt in the mind of voters ... when you deliver a negative ad,” Devine said. “People come along, and they want the silver bullet ... that’s going to absolutely destroy your opponent and win the election. And it doesn’t exist.”
McKinnon sees the popularity of negative campaign ads as a product of their effectiveness in drawing voter attention. But voters are becoming increasingly disgusted with negative campaign ads, McKinnon said. He predicted that candidates will likely shift to more positive ad content.
Balz added that voters may see a decrease in television campaign ads due to an increase in online political advertising.
“We all may think that television ads don’t have the impact they once had ... but the role of television advertising is still enormously important and a very central part of any successful campaign,” Balz said.

At last night’s annual Ingersoll Lecture on immortality—a lecture series initiated in 1896 by Harvard President Charles W. Eliot, class of 1853—Robert R. Desjarlais elaborated on the beliefs of Nepal’s Yolmo Buddhists.
The Yolmo believe that one’s experience of dying has a direct impact on one’s consciousness in the afterlife and in the next life, according to Desjarlais, an anthropology professor at Sarah Lawrence College in New York.
Titled “Cessation and Continuity: Poiesis in Life and Death among Nepal’s Yolmo Buddhists,” Desjarlais approached the topic of immortality by outlining the death rituals of the Yolmo people.
In the Yolmo culture, the living and dead exist simultaneously, and during both, one must live in accordance with the ideas of karma. One’s family and friends must support and calm the dying in order to help the dying achieve a good next life.
“Dying without fear and with little longing for the life he was leaving behind” is the path to a good death, Desjarlais said. Following death, individuals enter the “in-between,” where the deceased are still attached to the living.
“Even thinking about the person can draw that person’s consciousness back to the house, and that can lead to the haunting of the house,” Desjarlais said.
The families then complete their funeral rites by cremating the dead and destroying any remnants of the person who passed away, in order to sever ties between the dead and their previous life. By disassembling the physical reminders of the individual’s life, the families enable the person to move to a new life, underscoring the Buddhist idea of “doing through undoing,” Desjarlais said.
Desjarlais was introduced by Divinity School Visiting Professor Michael D. Jackson, who nominated Desjarlais as the speaker.
“He was working on the afterlife in a very non-Western sense and a very different orientation,” Jackson said. “I thought he would be a great speaker.”
Desjarlais has spent a large amount of time conducting anthropological fieldwork in the Nepal Himalayas.
The Sperry Room of Andover Hall was about half-full—a change from Ingersoll Lectures of years past, which were held in Sanders Theater and drew larger audiences.
But audience members expressed enthusiasm about the talk.
“I was interested in the process of personalization and depersonalization and how ritual becomes a vehicle for the process,” said Charles G. Carstens, a Ph.D. student at the Divinity School.
Karin Grundler-Whitacre, Divinity School Assistant Dean for Faculty and Academic Affairs, organized the event and said it was a success.
“I thought it was very thoughtful and a real insight into the Yolmo people,” she said. “It was a wonderful lecture, very engaging.”

The founder of Yipit—a website that aggregates and recommends daily deals from online coupon sites, such as Groupon—hosted a workshop on creating an internet start-up on Thursday at Harvard’s Innovation Lab.
The workshop, titled “How to go from Idea to Funded Startup,” is part of the i-Lab’s broader effort to offer both space and programming for entrepreneurial pursuits.
Drawing on his own experiences starting Yipit, Vinicius R. Vacanti ’03 spoke to a full room about all stages, from idea to production, of creating a start-up.
Vacanti emphasized that start-up founders must push through inevitable “bad ideas,” and cited his own experience as an undergraduate in Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I” as an inspiration for his current work.
Jodie Goldstein, who organized the workshop, emphasized the applicability of Vacanti’s real-world experience.
“I think he’s at a really good stage of the [start-up] life cycle to give valuable insight to students,” she said.
“It’s really crucial for people to get that perspective.”
Students at the presentation found Vacanti’s advice helpful.
“I was surprised at the level of expertise that he applied to very fundamental questions and issues that start-ups are facing,” said Pierre R. Fatal, a student at the Harvard Extension School.
Although the official launch of the i-Lab is still two weeks away, this is the sixth program to be hosted by the center. By the end of the fall semester, there will have been twelve workshops, with more planned for spring.
Students in attendance, and Vacanti himself, expressed their support for the i-Lab and its mission of encouraging collaborative and entrepreneurial endeavors.
“It’s a very supportive, incredibly accessible community,” Harvard Kennedy School student Martin S. Bell said, citing the ability of the i-Lab to bring students from across the University and other local universities together.
Vacanti echoed Bell’s sentiment, saying, “I think it’s beautiful. I wish it had existed when I was here.”
One key to a successful startup, Vacanti said, was drawing users away from competitors.
“You should convince the user that instead of spending five minutes looking at their ex on vacation on Facebook, they should spend it on your site,” he said.

At the Office of Career Services’ fifth annual Global Health Fair on Thursday afternoon, over 250 students met with a wide variety of global health organizations.
Event organizers Loredana George and Oona B. Ceder of OCS said they have observed a growing interest in public health among students. In 2007, the University approved a secondary field in Global Health and Health Policy.
Ceder said that she hoped the fair would allow students to gain awareness of the various opportunities, including paying jobs, available in public health.
This fair also demonstrates OCS’s efforts to collaborate with Harvard student groups and other Harvard schools. Co-sponsors of the fair included the Harvard Undergraduate Global Health Forum, the Harvard College Health Management Group, and, for the first time, the Harvard School of Public Health.
Peiyi Su ’13—the president of the recently founded Harvard College Health Management Group—said she reached out to OCS because of their history of co-sponsoring events with student groups. Su said she was impressed by attendance at the event and the diversity of presenters.
“There are a lot of resources available at Harvard, but students don’t know about them,” said Su.
OCS staff members said that attendance was up at this year’s fair, even though the event was one hour shorter than it was last year. Robin Mount, the director of the Office of Career, Research, and International Opportunities, said she had never seen a fair fill up so quickly.
At the fair representing the consulting company Global Health Strategies, Audrey A. White ’10 said that she attended similar events as an undergraduate, but that they never had such high attendance.
Erica A. Johnson ’15 and Jake W. C. Silberg ’15 said they were inspired to attend the event because they are currently enrolled in University Professor Paul E. Farmer’s popular global health Gen Ed class Societies of the World 25. Partners in Health—the non-profit which Farmer co-founded in 1987—was one of the presenters at the fair.
Johnson said she was interested in looking into summer and January opportunities related to public health.
Peace Corps Regional Recruiter Allyson K. Snell said that her organization was very excited to be attending the fair.
“We look for Harvard students because they possess the skills, experience, and background to be a good volunteer,” Snell said.
Snell attributed this to Harvard students’ combination of strong academic and experiential learning backgrounds.
OCS plans to hold similar events for students interested in global health, including a possible Human Rights Fair, throughout the year.

The University closed the 2011 fiscal year with a $130 million deficit on $3.9 billion in expenses, a significant jump from the last year’s annual deficit of $900,000, according to Harvard’s annual financial report.
According to the report, the deficit stemmed from a 4.5 percent increase in spending, associated with higher compensation costs and the increased cost of payments associated with debt, which increased during the financial crisis of 2008.
“As a percentage of [the operating budget] it’s still reasonably small. With that said, any deficit is going to be a cause for concern,” University Vice President for Finance Daniel S. Shore said. “We want people to understand that we are strong financial managers and good stewards of University resources.”
Shore said the University plans to pursue methods to both cut costs and increase revenue in coming years to address the deficit.
Shore cited a number of projects aimed at increasing the University’s operating efficiency as part of the cost-cutting effort. Among these are the consolidation of the University’s IT systems, the overhaul of the University library system, and efforts aimed at “better leveraging purchasing power with vendors.”
“The aggregate of those activities that take place in multiple parts of the University, they add up,” Shore said in reference to the potential benefits of such changes.
Shore added that Harvard’s largest budget item is personnel expenses and said that administrators would be examining those expenses in the near future to find cost savings.
“There’s several different avenues [to decrease expenses]. Half of our budget is wage and benefit expenses,” Shore said. “There are a bunch of personnel and non-personnel things we are looking for on the cost side.”
In the wake of the 2008 financial decline and the subsequent recession, Harvard froze salaries and wages across the University in addition to laying off hundreds of workers in an effort to stem the deficit.
Shore said that cost-cutting measures are not the only way the University is looking to balance its books and that the University would be exploring avenues to increase revenue.
In fiscal year 2011, the University saw a 1 percent increase in revenue. Federal funding for research increased by $66 million to $686 million, student tuition and fees increased by $29 million, and current-use giving increased by 12 percent to $277 million. Despite this, Shore said the University would explore alternate methods of funding, a sentiment echoed by University President Drew G. Faust.
“Changing financial realities require an ongoing examination of our funding model with its reliance on government support, endowment returns, and tuition—all of which are expected to be either declining or constrained in the years ahead,” Faust wrote in the report.
Shore said that Harvard has contingency measures in place to respond to potential funding issues, including the continued threat of volatility in capital markets and the potential for long-term declines in federal grants.
We have “robust approaches to scenario planning,” Shore said. “We look at downside scenarios that presume that the downside scenario is quite a bit less than [anticipated].”

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction.
CORRECTION: NOV. 4, 2011
The Nov. 4 article "FY 2011 Budget Deficit Climbs" incorrectly reported that Harvard's debt service payments had increased because of debt accrued during the 2008 financial crisis. In fact, while the debt increased during that time, the debt service payments come from debt that was also accrued before the financial crisis.

A team of computer scientists from Harvard, Yale, and Boston University recently discovered a security leak in the mobile version of Yelp—a popular business review website—that gave site visitors access to a large quantity of reviewers’ personal information, including email addresses, full names, and birth dates.
Georgios Zervas, an affiliate at the Harvard Center for Research on Computation and Society and a Simons Postdoctoral Fellow at Yale, first came across the security bug while browsing Yelp’s mobile website, m.yelp.com.
Normally when accessing a site like Yelp, the user’s phone received information packaged in the JavaScript Object Notation format, and extracted certain fields to be viewed on the mobile device. But due to a flaw in coding, other, non-displayed fields within the data were also easily accessible.
Zervas, looking at information exchanged between his browser and the Yelp server, discovered that he was able to see a large amount of data that is not normally accessible to site visitors.
Zervas immediately shared the information with Harvard Computer Science Professor Michael D. Mitzenmacher and Boston University Computer Science Professor John W. Byers—both of whom served as his PhD advisors. The three still conduct research together on the relationship between social networking and internet economics.
“My very first reaction was to ask for a second opinion from people who are much more experienced than I am,” Zervas said.
According to its blog, Yelp immediately shut down its mobile site upon learning of the leak last week. After fixing the faulty code that caused the problem, engineers combed over the site multiple times looking for other vulnerabilities.
The three agreed that they were somewhat surprised by the security leak, especially given Yelp’s high profile.
“Yelp is a big company—they have an awful lot of user records,” said Byers. “Keeping these records buttoned up is a high priority for them and should be a high priority for anyone who has such a lot of user content on hand.”
Byers added that anyone with a smartphone could stumble upon personal information of Yelp reviewers.
But the security leak could have been much worse had financial information about reviewers been exposed as well, according to Zervas.
“Initially I was surprised, yes, but then I can understand from a technical perspective how something like that can happen,” he said. “They make changes on their website three times a day on average and make those changes live. Human errors are likely and they can happen.”
Mitzenmacher said he was very impressed with Yelp’s response when the three researchers approached the website with their findings.
“They took it seriously,” he said. “To me, it shows a positive university and business interaction that can come about from research and research projects—that that relationship can be friendly and non-adversarial when these sorts of things come up.”

Associate Vice President for Public Affairs and Communications Kevin Casey updated Allston residents on Harvard’s plans for Allston Thursday morning, during the informal coffee hour hosted by Harvard at the Educational Portal.
The University designed the monthly meetings as an initiative to gain community feedback for the recommendations on Harvard’s next steps for its Allston development. A series of recommendations were presented by the Harvard Allston Work Team—a 14-person group of deans, faculty, and alumni commissioned by University President Drew G. Faust—were approved in September.
Casey informed residents that, based upon feedback from a past Task Force meeting, the University is in the midst of discussions with the City in order to develop “clearer direction on some of the procedures to be used to manage development on Harvard’s projects.”
During the meeting, Task Force members—residents appointed by the Boston Redevelopment Authority as representatives of the community—said that community concerns about their quality of life have been ignored in favor of Harvard’s expansion.
In response, Casey said that three or four meetings would be hosted to gain community input on design plans for future sites.
But, during Thursday’s coffee hour Casey said that these tete-a-tetes have been put on hold to better inform community members of the University’s next steps.
“We heard the Task Force at the last meeting, and we are collaborating with the City on developing clearer direction on procedures. We don’t want to put the cart before the horse, because we believe that these charettes are important,” Casey said.
Casey explained that the University is currently thinking through its planning areas, such as Barry’s Corner—located at the intersection of North Harvard St. and Western Ave. The Work Team recommendations called for Harvard to enhance the area with mixed-development projects that would include housing for faculty, graduate students, and other Allston residents, as well as retail outlets.
Resident Thomas Lally said the community was in dire need of more retail outlets since the community lost its local KMart when construction on the Allston Science Complex began.
Community member John McQueen suggested that Harvard should create a “blown-up map” to highlight future development sites within the context of the entire Allston neighborhood.
“Things would probably move faster if there was an overall blueprint,” McQueen said.
Residents also asked whether or not replacements have been found for Michael F. Glavin and Kevin A. McCluskey ’76 who were former key players in Harvard’s advancements into Allston.
Glavin—who coordinated development work with the Allston community and Harvard for the Boston Redevelopment Authority—left his position in the BRA in October to lead the Office of Strategic Planning and Community Development in Somerville. McCluskey left after acting as Harvard’s envoy to the Allston community for 22 years.
Casey said he has not filled the post yet, but that he plans to fill the role of senior director of community relations for Boston that McCluskey formerly held soon.

The lineup of candidates vying for president and vice president of the Undergraduate Council underwent slight changes this week, as a new ticket gained approval to join the race and another team dropped out.
The new ticket—consisting of UC outsiders Ryan P. Halprin ’12 for the top spot and Aneliese K. Palmer ’12 for vice president—entered the race late Wednesday night. The following morning, former presidential candidate Samuel Melton ’13 and his running mate Maxwell P. Campion ’13 announced that they would drop out.
Melton said he was unaware before he withdrew that a fourth ticket had been approved.
After participating in a special appeals process, Halprin and Palmer received approval for late entry from the Undergraduate Council Election Commission on Wednesday night.
As a penalty for declaring their ticket after the official deadline, the duo has been granted less time for campaigning. While the other candidates can start their campaigns on Monday, Halprin and Palmer must wait until Tuesday.
“I think it is great that the Election Commission is being flexible in letting all students with interest enter the race,” said current UC President Senan Ebrahim ’12.
Melton said that he and Campion had originally decided to enter the race after attending the UC’s meeting last month with University President Drew G. Faust, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith, a question-and-answer session which was open to the entire student body.
“We were frustrated by the fact that the administrators didn’t seem to be taking the UC seriously and were shutting down their ideas about social space and other issues that concerned students,” Melton said. “After the meeting we thought that, as outsiders, we could shake up the UC a bit, bring new ideas, and help the average student get their voice heard.”
But shortly after entering the race, the pair decided that in fact they believe the other tickets—Danny P. Bicknell ’13 with Pratyusha Yalamanchi ’13, and Crystal D. Trejo ’13 with David H.A. LeBoeuf ’13—will be more effective since they all currently hold leadership positions on the UC.
Announcing his intent to withdraw, Melton said, “Our decision this morning to drop out was based on fact that we believe Danny and Crystal have the same ideas and hopes that we do, but having been on the UC they have more experience with the system so they may be more efficient in getting things done.”
He added, “Both of them have been very open about the things they want to accomplish. Ultimately we seemed to be hearing recurring themes and our platforms were shaping up to be quite similar.”
Vice presidential candidate LeBoeuf is also an inactive Crimson news writer.

Although James M. Williamson ran for Cambridge City Council in 2009, comparatively little information about him is available. Williamson has no printed campaign literature, a website coming soon, and no funds to spend on advertising.
He describes himself as an event organizer, a publicist, and a neighborhood activist. Williamson has been involved in activist movements since high school, when he joined the Students for a Democratic Society, a student movement prominent in the 1960s. He says he attended New York University but was expelled as a result of his protests against the Vietnam War.
“I was a victim of oppression around vigorous protests to war,” Williamson says.
After his expulsion, he moved to Cambridge, where he has lived for the past forty years. He says he has since taken courses at Boston University and later the Harvard Extension School. Williamson says he continues to audit classes.
Williamson says his chief motivation for running is the current Council’s lack of initiative in addressing the concerns of City residents. His criticisms of the City Council extend to its lack of familiarity with the areas in which people live. He thinks the city’s governing body is too removed from residents and their problems.
“The people who run the government are out of touch, and the people we elect, who should be the watchdogs, aren’t doing their jobs,” Williamson says. “They don’t get it. They’re not paying attention. I never see any of them around.”
Williamson says he is concerned with issues that directly affect the public and that the City Council can tackle with or without the city manager’s support.
In this election, Williamson is directing his attention at sidewalk safety, an issue he says is overlooked by the current City Council. Williamson has been frustrated that cyclists are allowed to ride on the sidewalk in some areas and not in others and that those geographical areas change with little warning. Several serious injuries have resulted from a lack of enforcement of bicycle laws, Williamson says. In the fall of 2010, Ruth Daniloff, a 75 year-old woman, was hit by a bicycle in Cambridge, according to an op-ed she authored in The Boston Globe. In Williamson’s opinion, city councilors have not responded adequately to these incidents.
“If we are a city with handsomely paid people, with an enormous bureaucracy, and all this money, if we have this kind of negligence, we are in bad shape,” Williamson says. “This is what motivates me. Wake up, people.”
Williamson is also concerned with public transportation, specifically the temporary weekend disruption of Red Line service between Alewife and Harvard Square.
“I am very distressed with the way the MBTA is handling that situation. They only notified the public less than two weeks from when this massive dislocation will take place,” Williamson says. “We need to improve public transportation dramatically.”
As a public housing resident, Williamson views himself as a relatable candidate who is an active member of the community he seeks to represent. He participates in the Alliance of Cambridge Tenants, which is made up of public housing residents and voucher holders. For the past few months, he has devoted his full attention to his candidacy.
“We are losing more and more of what we care about because people aren’t doing their jobs. That’s my number one problem with the City Council,” Williamson says.
“It’s not enough to have a $70,000 job in Cambridge,” Williamson says, speaking about the city councilors’ annual salaries. “Several of them have other paid jobs—their ‘real’ jobs. I wouldn’t have a problem with it if they got things done.”
In addition to his focus on commuter safety, Williamson is concerned with developing more democratic structures. Were he elected to the City Council, Williamson says he would hold more meetings that would allow citizens to voice their concerns and participate in city budgeting.
“I’m just doing my bit just like anybody else, trying in my way to participate in what I would hope will be a more democratic self-government,” Williamson says. “It’s not that hard to get on the ballot. It is hard to get elected. The difference is money.”
Williamson invites voters to be more critical of the campaign materials they receive and to play a more active role in civic engagement. He urges the public to consider how and from where other candidates are collecting their funds.
Due to his fears that other candidates are relying on real estate developers to provide funding that will ultimately be detrimental to the community’s best interest, Williamson says he has signed documents drawn up by the Massachusetts Office of Campaign and Political Finance pledging to neither raise nor spend money in this election.
“The relationship between money and politics has to be broken. It has to be re-imagined and reconstructed as public financing of our public elections,” Williamson says. “Otherwise, we’re going to be stuck forever with people with money and power controlling our government.”
The closest he has to campaign literature is flyers that he prints for free at the public library. Instead of signs and “political campaign junk,” he is relying on word of mouth and a short Cambridge Community Television video to spread awareness of his candidacy.
However, it appears these methods of campaigning are not as effective as Williamson would wish. His name seems to be relatively unknown in the Harvard Square area.
“I haven’t heard of him,” says Andrew F. Hammond, a Cambridge resident for 13 years.
Likewise, Mark T. Szretter, another area resident, has not heard of Williamson, but the issues at the forefront of his mind in this election align with Williamson’s platform.
“It would be nice for candidates to pay more attention to issues younger residents care about. They’ve done a poor job with the MBTA communicating what’s happening,” Szretter said, referring to the changes to the Red Line. “It was something I feel I wasn’t consulted on, and it totally affects my life,”
Although Williamson is not a big name in the upcoming election, he is still excited and committed to running for City Council this year.
“For forty years I’ve seen the things I love be destroyed and stepped on. For a while, I thought it couldn’t get worse,” Williamson says. “But it could. You always have to fight.”

Percy Haughton is undoubtedly one of the most successful coaches in Harvard football history, but while his results are indisputable, his legendary motivational tactics are dubious.
The legend of Haughton goes like this: In 1908 right before The Game, Haughton strangled a bulldog in front of his players in an attempt to motivate them to beat Yale.
Prior to the 1908 contest, Yale had dominated Harvard, shutting the Crimson out in six consecutive games. Needless to say, Harvard was looking to find any advantage they could find.
Whether or not it was the murdered bulldog that inspired the Crimson players, the squad was able to take down their rival—winning The Game by a score of 4-0 (back then field goals were worth four points).
In recent days, the killing has  been called into question, and it most likely did not occur. With that being said,  Haughton probably did have a bulldog made of paper-mache that he  strangled and would drag behind his car.
This year, Crimson head coach Tim Murphy will probably not have to revert to any sort of killing to motivate his players, seeing as The Game will probably end up determining the Ivy champion.

The top five in last week's power rankings did not fail to impress last weekend. With just a few more games remaining in the fall season, a few teams are really making some noise in the Ivy League.
5. Winter Sports Hype
Ok, this isn’t a team by any stretch of the imagination. But with student tickets to the men’s hockey home opener against Princeton on Friday nearly impossible to obtain—Who doesn’t like free?—the official start of the winter athletic season is just around the corner. Get excited.
4. Men’s Tennis
The Crimson's young guns were on full display at Harvard’s Halloween Invitational last weekend.  Four Crimson freshmen advanced to the A-flight semifinals, with Alex Steinroeder defeating Denis Nguyen in the championship match. With the women’s team getting most of the attention this fall, the men definitely deserve some recognition.
Previous ranking: Unranked
3. Co-ed Sailing
The sailors finished second at the originally-named 70th Erwin Schell Trophy last weekend. With the performance, the team qualified for the Atlantic Coast Championship.
Previous Rank: 3
2. Women’s Soccer (11-4-1, 5-0-1 Ivy)
With a 2-1 victory over Dartmouth on Saturday, the Crimson has clinched the league title and can claim outright possession of the championship with a win or tie at Columbia this weekend. At least half of the Harvard soccer community is winning.
Previous Rank: 2
1. Football (6-1, 4-0 Ivy)
I guess the hallmark of this year’s team is its unshakable ability to break the most bizarre of school records. With a 41-10 victory over Dartmouth on Saturday, the Crimson has extended its streak of scoring 40 or more points to four games for the first time in 121 years. The defense deserves some attention too, as it held the Big Green to only 234 total yards of offense.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, Harvard athletics is traveling to arguably the best college town in the world: New York City. That is, if you can even call the Big Apple a college town.
Crimson football, men’s soccer, women’s soccer, women's volleyball, and field hockey are all making the trip to Columbia this weekend to take on the Lions on their home turf.
Because Columbia’s campus is uptown, and its athletic complex is even further uptown, it makes sense to stay in the area.  Here are some suggested spots, all north of 90th Street, that are worth checking out:
1.  Fall Treats
If you like fall inspired foods, the Upper East Side is the right place to be. Sarabeth’s (1295 Madison Avenue between 92nd and 93rd Streets) has an outrageous pumpkin waffle that is served with honey, raisins, nuts and sour cream. Yura on Madison (1292 Madison Avenue between 91st and 92nd Streets) sells a pumpkin pie that was voted the best in New York City.
2.  Columbia Favorite
V & T pizzeria (1024 Amsterdam Avenue between 110th and 111th Streets) is a favorite of the Columbia University community. This 60-year-old institution is conveniently located right off campus and serves outstanding pizza.
3. Gossip Girl
Whether you are willing to admit it or not, the CW’s Gossip Girl is a guilty pleasure.  The show films in real New York City locations as it attempts to tell the stories of “Manhattan’s elite.”
If you want to see the shooting sites of the show’s ficticious prep schools, check out the Museum of the City of New York (1220 Fifth Avenue between 103rd and 104th Streets) or the Synod of Bishops (75 East 93rd Street). The Cooper-Hewitt Museum (2 East 91st Street) was the sight of Lily van der Woodsen’s wedding at the end of the first season.
Who knows, you might just run encounter Blake Lively on your journey.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the puck drops tonight at the Bright Hockey Center, the season will commence for the Harvard men’s hockey team in a head-to-head matchup with Ivy League rival Princeton (0-2-1).
Coming off a rough 2010-2011 season in which it finished with a 12-21-1 record, the Crimson will look to hit the ground running tonight with a strong core of returning players and an impressive freshman class.
Harvard’s group of freshmen is one of the nation’s top incoming classes, with four of the nine players being selected by NHL teams in this past year’s draft.
“I think we’re all good players, and we’re going to do everything we can to help the team out and have a good season,” rookie forward Petr Placek said.
Placek joins the Crimson after getting drafted 176th by the Philadelphia Flyers.
Another member of Harvard’s incoming class that will be looked to for offensive production this year will be forward Colin Blackwell, who tallied 33 goals and 33 assists in his senior season of high school.
“I’m pretty pumped up and anxious to get out there,” Blackwell said. “Obviously there will be some butterflies, but once you get out there it’s just another hockey game. It’s something I’ve been looking forward to for quite while now, so once it’s all said and done it should be a blast.”
Blackwell had an eventful spring prior to entering Harvard. In March he received Boston’s inaugural Mr. Hockey Award, which recognized him as the top high school player in Massachusetts. Then, just three months later, Blackwell was taken 194th overall in the NHL draft by the San Jose Sharks.
The returning players have taken the freshmen under their wings, and are looking to integrate them into the lineup as smoothly as possible.
“The upperclassmen have treated the freshmen just like one of their own,” Blackwell said. “They’ve been really good to us, and it has been a really good transition.”
Returning for Harvard are seven of its top nine scorers from 2010-11, including junior defenseman Danny Biega, who led the team in points.
In addition to Biega on the defensive end, the Crimson brings back senior captain Ryan Grimshaw and sophomore Dan Ford, both of whom played in all 34 games last year.
This season, Grimshaw will not only be looked to as the defensive linchpin, but he will also be the emotional leader of the team.
“Grimshaw is the purest definition of a good leader,” Placek said.
Grimshaw and his teammates have been preparing for the season since the start of the school year.
“We had a lot of captain’s practices when we first got here, and since the season started its been going really well,” Blackwell said. “We’ve had a lot of tough practices and everyone’s working hard. We’re anxious to get on the ice and get things rolling.”
On the sideline, Harvard also welcomes in some new faces with assistant coaches Albie O’Connell and Jerry Forton. In just their first season, the two are already making their presence felt.
“One [of the coaches] is a defensemen coach and the other has been working with the systems,” Blackwell said. “I think if we listen to them and stick to the systems that they’ve implemented, then we’ll be successful.”
To prepare for Princeton, the Crimson coaching staff has held video sessions to familiarize the team with the Ancient Eight foe.
“We’ve been going over their film from past years, and hopefully we can learn a little bit about them and use that to our advantage,” said Blackwell said.
Tonight’s battle on the ice will be the opener to Harvard’s season, while the Tigers enter the matchup with three games already under its belt. To counter Princeton’s experience on the ice this season, the Crimson will look to adjust quickly and capitalize early on to put the Tigers under pressure.
Harvard will specifically try to tame Princeton’s sophomore standout forward, Andrew Calof, who led the Tigers with 33 points last season.
“Princeton’s a big physical team and they’re an Ivy League school, so this is a big ECAC matchup,” Blackwell said. “We’ll want to get off to a good start.”
With tonight representing the first hockey of the season and the student rewards game of the week, Harvard is hoping to have an advantage on its home ice with a strong fan turnout.
“Hopefully we can get a lot of people there,” Blackwell said. “I know it should have a good atmosphere, so we’re really looking forward to it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Nov. 6, 2004, Harvard field hockey defeated Columbia for its 11th win of the season and a share of the Ivy League title.
Seven years later, that season stands as the last time the Crimson finished the year with a winning record. But all of that can change tonight, when Harvard (8-8, 3-3 Ivy) heads to the Big Apple to take on a familiar foe.
“It’s really been an exciting year, a turn-around year.” Crimson coach Sue Caples said. “You know, 8-8 sounds like an average season, but this team’s done a tremendous job bringing passion out to the field every day and really turning things around.”
Both the Lions (8-8, 4-2) and Harvard are riding two-game losing streaks after disappointing weekends in which the pair lost a total of four games by a combined five points. Columbia is currently tied for third place in the Ancient Eight, while the Crimson sits in fifth.
A win to close out the season would propel either team into the top half of the conference, a spot neither has been in since both achieved the feat in 2007.
“They’re a strong team that has had a terrific season,” Caples said. “We’re just watching film, looking for things to exploit. We feel that if we play our game, we’re going to see positive results.”
Tonight’s match also marks the last time co-captains Carly Dickson and Georgia McGillivray will suit up for Harvard. The two Victoria, British Columbia natives grew up playing together in the Pacific Northwest and are the lone remnants of the class of 2012. Together, they have started every game in their tenures with the Crimson.
“Carly and I have known each other for what seems like forever,” McGillivray said. “We’ve really grown up together. Being a captain with her has been extremely easy and comfortable.”
Despite their successes as annual All-Ivy honorees, the pair endured a 14-37 career record coming into 2011, in part due to a lack of depth.
“Those first three years, I don’t think Carly and Georgia ever came off the field,” Caples said. “They were, and are, the face of Harvard field hockey. But with the speed and athleticism of this freshman class and the implementation of our new system, now they’re getting an extra breather here and there.”
That new system is one that puts a premium on substitutions. Caples had tried to implement the strategy in the spring, but it was difficult to do so with a depleted roster. But with seven freshmen contributing regularly and a number of two-sport athletes returning for the fall, the team is now able to rotate players in and out every 10 minutes or so, and thus operate at a much faster pace.
“The whole freshman class has been great,” McGillivray said. “They’ve brought a new level of speed to the attacking line that’s allowed everyone to rotate and substitute quickly. In my four years here I’ve never seen a freshman class come in and contribute so significantly across the board like this.”
Most prominent amongst the rookies is Noell Painter, who is currently first on the team and top-ten in the Ancient Eight in goals (eight), assists (five) and points (21).
While the new system has benefited the offense, a lack of depth in the defense has resulted in the Crimson giving up the most shots in the Ivy League.
“We’re a little lean in the backfield,” Caples said. “Whenever Georgia comes out, I sort of hold my breath. It’s not for lack of confidence in the rest of the defense, it’s just she’s so valuable. Luckily we can always count on having Cynthia [Tassopoulos] back there.”
Tassopoulos’ junior campaign has been the talk of the Ancient Eight. The goalie currently leads the conference in saves (148), saves per game (9.25) and save percentage (.813) by healthy margins. Tassopoulos not only keeps Harvard in games with her saves, but also with her ability to organize the defense in front of her.
“Cynthia is extraordinary,” McGillivray said. “She’s such an important organizer and communicator for the defenders and midfielders. She definitely keeps us in line.”
Caples’ mantra this season has been “improve one percent every day.” In order for the Crimson to come away with a victory and give Dickson and McGillivray a suitable end to their illustrious careers, that cumulative improvement is going to have to show on the field.
“A win would be great, but I’m thrilled with how this season has gone already,” McGillivray said. “As long as we can build on what we’ve been doing these last couple of weeks, I think we should be great.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The year is 1812. The French Empire is at the peak of its power, and the nation of crepes and croissants controlled much of the European continent. Napoleon, all five-foot-nothing of him, was scoring all of the beautiful women and getting picked first in every game of pick-up basketball. Or something like that.
But the French emperor was not satisfied with what he had. Most of Europe wasn’t enough—he needed Russia, the barren wasteland of vodka and chess. Without expecting too much of a fight, Napoleon and his troops moved into Russia in June of 1812. But he forgot to take into consideration one critical factor: the weather.
By all accounts, the weather in Russia is terrible. Not 40-degree terrible, but I’m-wearing-five-layers-of-animal-fur-and-I-still-can’t-feel-my-arms terrible. And as a result, Napoleon lost, and the French empire quickly crumbled.
In the world of football, you learn from legends like Knute Rockne and Vince Lombardi. Not often do coaches take a page of out the old Bonaparte playbook. But Harvard coach Tim Murphy and the football team did something that too many erstwhile European conquerors did not—he remembered to account for the weather.
All season, the Crimson relied on its passing, and it worked. The team’s two quarterbacks, senior Collier Winters and junior Colton Chapple, set all sorts of records in the first six games of the year, and the two are responsible for the team’s offensive success since week two.
It all changed last week. The Crimson shifted its strategy with an impending snowstorm, and the run game became the emphasis for the first time all season. In front of literally tens of fans at Harvard Stadium, three different rushers passed the 100-yard mark as the home team cruised to another easy victory, 41-10.
Around the league, the weather had a big impact on the Penn-Brown game a few hours earlier. Battling heavy rain, neither team could muster much offense, but two Bears field goals were enough en route to a 6-0 win. The Brown victory completely changes the dynamic of the Ivy League.
For the first time, there’s no question that Harvard is the favorite in the Ancient Eight. And if the team wins out, the crown is coming to Cambridge.
But if Penn wins its next three games, it is also guaranteed at least a share of the title, and the same goes for Yale. So there is still a lot in the air.
BROWN (6-1, 3-1 Ivy) at YALE (4-3, 3-1)
If the mothers of the Harvard football team taught their sons good manners, I would hope that everyone on the Crimson squad is writing thank-you letters down to Providence.
The Bears took a huge burden off of Harvard’s shoulders last week by taking down Penn, handing the Quakers their first league loss in 18 games.
But after last week’s win, the Crimson shouldn’t really be cheering for either the Bears or the Bulldogs in tomorrow’s game.
Brown, Yale, and Penn all share second place in the Ivies right now with a 3-1 league record. So while the Quaker loss was huge because it gave Harvard sole possession of first place in the league, it means that there are three very clear threats chasing Harvard going into the final three games of the year.
Playing in cold and wintery conditions with the rest of the league, Yale beat Columbia, 16-13, but that score doesn’t tell the whole story. The Lions mounted a solid comeback at the end before the Bulldogs managed to hold them off.  The fact that Columbia kept the game so close should worry for Yale, especially as it enters a stretch of the year when it plays Harvard and Brown.
The Bulldogs go back to New Haven for the first time in almost month. Last week, quarterback Patrick Witt completed just two passes, but when your running back goes for 230 yards, it doesn’t really matter.
Like Harvard, Yale adjusted its game plan around the weather. Don’t count on the Bulldogs relying too much on the run again—unless, of course, New England gets hit with another freak snowstorm.
The title implications of this game can’t be overstated. This winner stays alive; the loser is all but eliminated.
Prediction: Yale 17, Brown 16
PRINCETON (1-3, 1-6 Ivy) at PENN (4-3, 3-1)
Penn suffered its first league loss of the season last week, but it was hardly its first lackluster game.
In the Quakers’ three earlier Ivy wins, Penn escaped only with fourth-quarter comebacks. That sort of luck catches up to you eventually, and Brown finally ended the Quakers’ long Ancient Eight win streak.
Ordinarily, I wouldn’t expect this game to be too close, but I have reservations. For one, Penn was tied with Columbia into the fourth quarter, a game that demonstrated the team’s vulnerability. The other is what I’ve seen from Princeton this year. Yes, a 1-6 record is hardly impressive, but in the third quarter of the Tigers’ game against the Crimson, Princeton proved that it could be an offensive threat.
Even so, I can’t imagine Penn losing to the Tigers. That would send the league into all kinds of chaos.
Prediction: Penn 28, Princeton 20
CORNELL (3-4, 1-3 Ivy) at DARTMOUTH (2-5, 1-3 Ivy)
Dartmouth is like that one drunk friend everyone has. I mean, sure, he’s a cool guy, but it’s always an interesting experience when you go drinking together.
Sometimes, he’s chill and one of those friendly drunks. But other times, he’s a sloppy mess, throwing himself at anything and anyone and hardly able to control any of his own actions.
Like your inebriated buddy, the Big Green is erratic and tough to predict. The team has certainly had its ups—a 37-0 win over Columbia proves that—but Dartmouth has taken its share of beatings as well.
In early October, the Bulldogs shut out the Big Green, and Dartmouth looked consistently outplayed on all fronts against Harvard last week.
Cornell, as I’ve said all year, has tremendous upside. Quarterback Jeff Mathews is a serious threat in the air, and is probably the best passer in the Ivies who isn’t wearing a Harvard uniform.
I’ll go with Cornell, but who knows which Dartmouth team decides to show up.
Prediction: Cornell 35, Dartmouth 28
HARVARD (6-1, 4-0 Ivy) at COLUMBIA (0-4, 0-7)
Lions are often associated with prideful and noble imagery. Simba. Richard the Lionheart. Lionel Richie.
The Columbia Lions don’t conform. The team is playing a little bit like the lion with the thorn in its paw, except there’s no mouse there to take out that thorn. As a consequence, that paw has become infected, and it’s slowly spreading into the rest of the lion’s body.
Harvard is probably playing its best football since 2008, the last time the Crimson won the Ivy title. Barring another week of rough conditions, I expect Winters to pick up right where he left off.
Excluding last week’s game against Dartmouth, Harvard’s quarterbacks have thrown 14 touchdowns in a three-game stretch, a program record by a wide margin. Even without passing much last week, the team matched an 1890 mark of four straight 40-point games.
With the state of Columbia’s defense, the Crimson could very easily get to 40 again. And it would be the first time that the team has scored 40-plus in five straight since 1888, when it defeated a smattering local high schools and MIT, among other opponents.
This shouldn’t be close. But who knows—football is a strange game sometimes.
Prediction: Harvard 45, Columbia 9
RECORD LAST WEEK: 4-0 (To date: 20-6)

When homework piles up and rehearsals and meetings last past midnight, students often end up sacrificing sleep in order to try to stay on top of everything.
 
We all know this is a regrettable situation. But if you find that you must burn the midnight oil, Flyby has some tips to help.
 
If you know early in the day that you'll need to pull an all-nighter:
 
-Try to save eating your dessert until the end of the day. The extra sugar kick will come in handy when you're trying to stay awake.
 
-Take a short nap early in the night. Your concentration level will probably benefit for hours from a little strategic sleep.
 
-Consider this unusual proposal: a caffeine nap. Drink a cup of coffee and then nap for 15 minutes. According to Wired, the caffeine will kick in just as you wake up.
 
-Stock up on the essentials. Make sure you have your preferred caffeine source on hand, whether that's soda, coffee, tea, energy drinks, or even breathable energy.
 
 If you're in the middle of an all-nighter:
 
 
 
-Try to break your workload into smaller, more manageable chunks, and consider changing work areas as you complete each section. For example, work in the library for a problem or two of a p-set, then switch to your room for the next few questions, then move to a common room. Yes, relocating takes time, but the new scenery and the sense of accomplishment each time you check off a task will help keep you alert. 
 
-Take a short walk around a well-lit part of campus. Walking around in the cold could be just the right physical and mental break you need.
 
-Dim the brightness on your computer. Unnecessary brightness puts extra strain on your eyes.
 
If you just must stay up and have tried everything else:
 
-Consider taking caffeine pills. Be sure to read the warnings on the box and to only use them rarely.
 
-Remind yourself how far you've come and concentrate on more relaxing days that lie ahead. Remembering that there is indeed an end to the vicious cycle of all-nighters may be just the motivation you need to make it until morning.
 
 
Of course, choose to avoid all-nighters altogether when you can. Through good daytime organization and focus, you might be able to get your sleep after all. And we all know that too many all-nighters are a very scary prospect.

Harvard may top the list of the best universities in the country, but not when it comes to sexual health, according to Trojan Brand Condoms.
In its sixth annual ranking of the nation’s most sexually healthy schools, Trojan ranked Harvard number 30 out of 141 universities—a drop from our number 16 place last year.
With Princeton winning third place, Brown ranking fourth, and Columbia taking first prize for the second year in a row, our Ivy League peers beat us out on the sexual health scale.
The rankings are judged based on the resources such as contraceptives, HIV testing, and outreach programs that each campus offers.
In a press release, Bruce Tetreault, a Trojan product manager, said that the rankings should "inspire students to take action into their own hands."
Go for it, Harvard. Just remember to use a condom.

With the Harvard-Yale game just around the corner, many students and alumni have been planning their weekends for weeks. If you ask these people what it would take for them to miss the game, many of them may jokingly say they wouldn't miss it for the world. For the Bulldogs' senior quarterback Patrick Witt, though, this has just become a very real question.
The Yale Daily News reported on Tuesday that its star quarterback has been selected for a final interview for the prestigious Rhodes Scholarship on Nov. 19 in Atlanta, the same day as The Game.
Witt, who held a 4.0 GPA while playing on the Nebraska football team, transferred to the Bulldogs in 2009, where he currently holds a 3.91 GPA as a history major. Witt started at Yale as a sophomore, and already holds the team record for most career completions. The backup quarterback, John Whitelaw, has just three pass attempts in his career.
Witt has yet to decide what he will do, but unless something can be worked out soon, Witt will have a big decision ahead of him: help the Bulldogs snap its four-game losing streak against the Crimson or try to help close the large gap between the number of Rhodes Scholars from Yale and Harvard.

Earlier this week on CNN’s Fareed Zakaria Global Public Square (GPS), Harvard's Lawrence A. Tisch Professor of History Niall Ferguson debated with the director of Columbia's Earth Institute and former Harvard economics professor Jeffery Sachs '76. The point of contention was the cause of inequality in the U.S. and the interests of the Occupy Movement.
Sachs sided with "the 99%" saying that "The top one percent not only ran away with the prize economically in the last 30 years, but also took the power, manipulated it, twisted it, broke the law."
Ferguson immediately responded by saying "it's important to avoid criminalizing one percent of the population … there's no question that major financial institutions have been fined and rightly so. But to turn that into an indictment of three million people seems to me … actually rather reckless."
For Ferguson the cause of inequality is not unregulated greed on Wall Street. He explained, "I think there's a legitimate argument that the biggest obstacle to social mobility in this country right now is not the fat cats of Wall Street, whom I do not rush to defend, but the teachers unions, who make it almost impossible to improve public school in cities like New York where we are today." Ferguson's argument essentially posits that because globalization is outsourcing unskilled labor to other countries, the U.S. must improve education in order to increase the number of skilled workers in the U.S. and restore the country to a more egalitarian prosperity.
In Ferguson's Oct. 25 article "Yes, Wall Street Helps the Poor," he elaborates that the remedy to education is "is to promote the kind of diversity and competition that already make the American university system the world's best. And one highly effective way of doing this is by setting up more charter schools—publicly funded but independently run and union-free." The so-called "one-percent' he says actually has helped in this cause. He references meeting a "ballroom full of New York hedge-fund managers" that were holding "a Texas Hold ’Em tournament to raise money for the Success Charter Network."
It was possibly a dubious decision for Ferguson to talk about education in terms of gambling. Similarly it was certainly ambitious for him to personally denounce Sachs during the GPS debate accusing him of having "overstepped the mark … ceased to be an academic and became a demagogue."
So yet again Ferguson has proven to be the United States' favorite social antagonist. He advocated for the Iraq War even when U.S. popular consensus felt otherwise. He championed the wonders of capitalism and market privatization in the wake of the 2009 financial collapse. And now he is decries the Occupy Movement as it gains nationwide support.
It's all right, Niall. No matter what side you take in the Occupy Movement, Harvard students still love you 100 percent. And it's definitely because of your accent.
