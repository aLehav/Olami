After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We believe in free speech. We believe this even when a video as offensive as it was poorly done causes riots throughout the world. It is important that we remember that.
However, it is also important that we remember the purpose of free speech. Free speech exists to defend a minority position. It does not exist to discriminate arbitrarily against a group.
As the riots in the Middle East reached their peak last week, the French magazine Charlie Hebdo published lewd depictions of the prophet Mohammed despite numerous objections. The editors defended their decision in the name of free speech. They called it a satire of the film and the news dominating our headlines of the demonstrations and violence that it has triggered. Stephane Charbonnier, the director of the magazine, stated explicitly that this “grotesque film,” not the prophet Mohammed, was the target of the cartoons.
Why then do the cartoons depict Mohammed naked and performing sexual acts? What is the point of these cartoons in the wake of violence and death?
Clearly, they can exist only to insult and inflame religious tensions. In the context of the past week, these cartoons are no longer idiotic and petty caricatures but threats to the safety of many in the region. Multiple French consulates and embassies have closed in anticipation of potential repercussions.
Yesterday, Nicholas D. Kristof ’82 wrote in The New York Times about the relationship between violence and insults to Islam. It is true that other religions do not react violently to religious insults. And it is also true that many Muslims counter-protested and apologized for the recent protests.
But it is true as well that religion may be a means as well as a motive. Within the region, religious identity is the ideal means of political exploitation, easier than ethnic identity and more effective than national identity. By manipulating religion, an extremist group transforms a cheap and amateur video into a call to arms against the West’s hatred of Islam and its way of life.
Last Friday, the Obama administration defined the attacks on the United States consulate in Benghazi as intentional acts of terrorism. There is strong evidence that the groups behind these attacks initiated the protests and even more evidence that they have exacerbated the conflict in pursuit of their own ends.
We can only understand the danger of the French cartoons within this context. Any exploitable content is ideological ammunition. The right catalyst could ignite the region and mobilize an extremist group from the periphery to the center of power.
The purpose of free speech does not just depend on its initial context. It also depends on the use of that speech in the public sphere where any group may manipulate its use.
The Middle East remains suspended on the edge of instability and any event may tilt the balance. “A revolution isn’t an event, but a process,” Kristof writes. And he is right, but certain events may accelerate the process and cause it to ignite.

The chemical industry’s foremost trade association is embroiled in the controversy over Bisphenol A, the primary compound in the polycarbonate that lines food and beverage cans and comprises most hard plastic products. Recent studies suggest that BPA is as dangerous as it is ubiquitous. The press is catching on. Prominent columnists like The New York Times’ Nicholas D. Kristof ’82 have honed in on BPA as a potential health threat. An estrogen-mimicking compound, BPA is thought to have disruptive effects on the endocrine system, causing reproductive abnormalities and elevating risks of prostate or breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes.
Although scientists, environmentalists, and consumer advocates have long petitioned for a federal ban on BPA in manufactured goods, the Federal Drug Agency has been reluctant to acknowledge the potential health risks associated with BPA.
Last July, the FDA banned the use of BPA in baby bottles and toddlers’ sippy cups. In good faith, consumer advocates perceived this move as a step in the direction of a federal crackdown on BPA. Few realized that the regulation was in direct compliance with a request from the American Chemistry Council, a trade association that represents all major companies in the global chemical manufacturing industry, including most manufacturers of BPA.
The ACC-compliant ruling came on the heels of the FDA’s refusal to affirm several BPA studies by various research institutions. In 2008, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported concern over potentially adverse effects of BPA exposure in children. Later that year, the FDA rejected the National Resource Defense Council’s petition for a BPA ban, citing a lack of conclusive evidence. The FDA has likewise failed to acknowledge concerns from the National Institute of Health and American Medical Association.
In its explanation of the sudden BPA ban in infant and toddler products, the FDA maintained its position that exposure to the chemical is safe for all age groups, asserting that the ruling was “not based on safety, but is based on the fact that regulatory authorization is no longer necessary for the use of the food additive because that use has been permanently and completely abandoned.” In other words, allowing BPA in baby products had become obsolete because plastic manufacturers had voluntarily discontinued the use of the purportedly safe chemical in those products, presumably amidst media coverage of BPA-related health concerns that deflated consumer confidence. While these concerns were hardly unfounded, the FDA’s convoluted ruling did, at least, safeguard babies from direct exposure to the potentially toxic chemical.
New evidence suggests that BPA exposure might have adverse effects on children, not just babies, necessitating a wider ban by the FDA. A recent study in the Journal of the American Medical Association revealed an association between high BMI and high BPA levels in children. Controlling for behavioral factors such as television watching, the study concluded that, among children in the lowest quartile of BPA levels, 10 percent were obese. Obesity was more than twice as prevalent, at 22.3 percent, in children who exhibited the highest levels of BPA. The alarming implications of this study make it clear that it is high time for the FDA to issue a comprehensive ban on BPA. Yet the American Chemistry Council was quick to decry the study, and the FDA could in turn follow suit and turn a blind eye.
That BPA should be strictly banned from infants’ and toddlers’ products, while it remains a chief component in the diets and daily lives of their parents and siblings, constitutes a breach of rationality uncharacteristic of the FDA. When the chemical circulates in 9 out of 10 American bodies, any level of association with serious health problems calls for swift, regulatory action on a federal scale.
This doesn’t mean that banning BPA will be an end-all solution. Indeed, manufacturers of packaged foods and plastic goods have already capitalized on the consumer appeal of “BPA free” labels by creating products from closely related compounds that are potentially as dangerous. BPA notwithstanding, plastics teem with dozens of other complicated, recently engineered chemical compounds whose long-term safety (or toxicity) has yet to be proven.
The necessity of a comprehensive ban on BPA, then, is a matter of principle as well as safety. The BPA question is a landmark case that will set a significant precedent for how the FDA regulates—or quietly submits to—the 21st century chemical industry. Consumers are technologically empowered to educate themselves and lobby for their best interests, but they continue to lack the financial prowess and political wherewithal to take on the behemoth of industry.
If the FDA continues to cast doubts on significant scientific findings in favor of counsel from the ACC, who will stand up for consumers? It’s your move, FDA.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mitt Romney’s ineptitude at handling matters of foreign policy became egregiously clear when disparaging remarks he made about Palestinians at a fundraiser in May went viral on the web. Romney’s absurd claims that “the Palestinians have no interest whatsoever in establishing peace” have been widely criticized, not least by Palestinians themselves, who are justly incensed. Seen in a certain light, Romney’s accomplishment is rather impressive; with just a couple of sentences, he’s assured that, were he elected come November, America’s efforts to promote peace in the Middle East over the next four years would fail.
The specifics of Romney’s blunder do not matter greatly, however. What does matter are Romney’s continued attempts to criticize President Barack Obama because he allegedly “doesn’t have the same feelings about American exceptionalism that we do.” Perhaps even more important are the ways Americans view and define themselves at a time when international concerns should take center stage on the national consciousness.
Recently, a poll found that 80 percent of Americans believe that their country possesses “unique character that makes it the greatest country in the world.” Now, there is nothing bad about believing that your country is exceptional. Any citizen of any country should take pride in his or her heritage and identity. But there is a difference—a subtle yet crucial one—between saying, “we are great” and proclaiming, “we are the greatest.” The latter sentiment unnecessarily creates an “us versus them” mentality and, worse, creates an unfounded illusion of superiority.
A closer examination of the facts show otherwise. American workers are not the most productive or the most prosperous, and they are certainly not the most educated (on that last count, they are failing miserably). For now, the U.S. economy remains the world’s biggest, but that will change in less than five years as the Chinese economy overtakes it. Furthermore, as Brazil, India, and other developing countries continue to emerge as world powers in their own right, America’s importance on the world stage is sure to diminish, although it will certainly remain significant.
The extent of Romney’s views on foreign policy can be found in a 2011 speech, in which he declared, “As President of the United States, I will devote myself to an American Century. And I will never, ever apologize for America.” As to the first part of that statement, there’s close to nothing Romney, Obama, or any other leader can do to guarantee American hegemony in the 21st century. The best the nation’s leaders can do is cooperate closely with other nations to ensure that American interests are protected and furthered across the globe, recognizing the sometimes-competing interests of other states while striving to avoid conflict. As to the second part of Romney’s manifesto, it is just flat-out wrong. Nations are imperfect, and they must sometimes apologize for their actions. This is what the North American Treaty Organization did in June after an airstrike by American forces killed 18 civilians in an Afghan village. To suggest that America should not apologize for anything, ever, is to turn one’s back on the notion that America has any moral authority to intervene in world affairs. For with such authority comes the necessity to take responsibility for whatever consequences may result of it.
Sadly, polls show that foreign policy is only a priority for three percent of American voters. That’s hardly surprising, given the fact that in Romney Republicans picked a presidential candidate with virtually no foreign policy experience, while far more qualified candidates such as Jon M. Huntsman Jr. received almost no support during the primaries. Or take four years ago. In no other developed country would someone as important as a vice-presidential candidate quantify her foreign policy credentials by claiming that her state could “see Russia from land here.” Yet at a time when American dominance is waning, voters should turn to someone who can skillfully represent the country abroad. Now more than ever, the next President of the United States needs foreign policy experience, or at least an open mind when approaching such issues—he should not simply parrot the false truth of American superiority.
Hopefully, the American people and their leaders will learn that greatness is not something they inherit and certainly not something they are entitled to, but something that must be earned and sustained through actions. A truly exceptional America would respect the merits of other nations—it would admire its own achievements without having to compare them to those of others. A truly exceptional America would lead the world not because it is somehow destined to, but because it would be willing to recognize its own shortcomings in order to overcome them and courageous enough to apologize should the occasion call for it. A truly exceptional America, in short, would be humble. And while the polls suggest it’s unlikely that America’s next president will be Mitt Romney, the country seems to be swerving toward arrogance at the worst of times.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After years of students bringing Facebook into the classroom, Harvard courses have turned the tables and brought classes to Facebook. This semester, an academic department at Harvard paid for Facebook advertisements to sell its classes to Harvard students. The Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations bought the spots to advertise some of its language offerings, as well as three other undergraduate courses.
The move, an escalation of the already common practice of advertising for courses by putting up posters around campus and even, in some cases, making course trailers to advertise their content to students, has the potential to help boost students’ awareness of the offerings of smaller departments.
For less high-profile departments, this move has the opportunity to make students aware of options that could be excellent educational opportunities for them, even though many students might not usually trawl through the course listings of these departments.
What’s more, it can help make the smaller classes themselves more effective. Classes that are designed as lectures but wind up having only three students are damaged in similar, if opposite, ways that seminars with almost 30 students are. Even a seminar or language section, if under-enrolled, is improved by the addition of a few extra students. Departments should make every reasonable effort, including paid advertisement if necessary, to ensure that course enrollments reflect their quality of teaching.
This heightened awareness could, in turn, help larger departments as well. Very often, students make their choices for classes based on limited information about offerings and what their friends are taking. As such, large classes get larger (and more often lotteried) as more people have friends who have taken or are taking them. Small classes, on the other hand, are more and more left to the comparatively small group of people involved with their respective departments.
It makes sense that Facebook should be the next medium through which Harvard professors sell their courses to students, considering the fact that such a large portion of the student body does their shopping through the site now, either informally asking friends for recommendations or perusing Courses.CS50, which can be tied to a students Facebook profile. Such an advertising tactic seems more likely to be successful than the traditional methods, which rely on students remembering the poster they saw outside the Science Center when choosing courses.
Of course, this sort of advertising is not for everyone. Courses that expect to be lotteried or that are already very well known would be better off not advertising and instead limiting themselves solely to the students who most want to participate in them. However, for the smaller departments on campus this kind of move makes a lot of sense, and we hope to see more of them giving it a shot.

The results of the Undergraduate Council General Election, announced Friday night, reveal an increase in female representation and the faltering of the newly formed Crimson Coalition.
In all, 43 candidates—representing the 12 residential Houses, four freshman districts, and Dudley House—were elected to the UC. This year, 90 candidates filed campaign declarations to run for one of the 43 open seats.
Of the 43 newly elected members, 18—or roughly 42 percent—are female. In last year’s election, only 33 percent of elected members were female. This year and last year’s results reveal substantial progress from 2010, when only nine female candidates were elected to the UC.
This fall, the UC launched initiatives aimed at increasing female participation. One of these efforts included the release of a YouTube video by UC Vice President Pratyusha Yalamanchi ’13 encouraging women to run.
“We did see a higher percentage of females elected, which I’m happy to see,” Yalamanchi said. “I think we’re starting to see some of our gender parity efforts come to fruition. I think it’s important we do see many different perspectives on the Council.”
UC President Danny P. Bicknell ’13 and Yalamanchi both noted that despite there still being a gender gap amongst elected candidates, this year represented the first time in UC history that the number of female candidates equaled the number of male candidates.
“The number of female candidates has jumped from 35% last year to 50% this year,” according to an e-mail sent to students from the duo. “This year’s candidate pool is reflective of our student body.”
Gender parity was not the only issue to come up in this year’s election. The Crimson Coalition, a group that aims to increase student power and reform the UC, made noise earlier this month when they began organizing a UC takeover.
The Coalition learned Friday night that only four of their candidates were elected to the Council. The group had originally intended to win a 25-seat majority in order to enact their platform of reform, but only 12 candidates ran under the Coalition name.
In preparation for the new term, representatives elected in last week’s election underwent leadership training Saturday. The leadership intensive aims to orient the newly elected members to the Harvard administration, past UC initiatives, and the UC structure, according to Bicknell.
“It’s going to be a really transformative time for the Council as we implement new initiatives and galvanize student support,” Bicknell said. “We’re really excited.”

Harvard School of Public Health researchers found that a greater consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is linked with a greater genetic susceptibility to increased risk of obesity and high body mass index.
The HSPH study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, reinforced the view that genetic and environmental factors interact to increase obesity risk.
“If people have a higher genetic risk for obesity, the effects of obesity will be exaggerated by the sugar-sweetened beverages,” said Qibin Qi, a HSPH research fellow and the lead author of the study.
“This provides some evidence to people to reduce their intake of sugary beverages, especially for people who are at a high genetic-risk for obesity,” he said.
Researchers looked at data from three other large HSPH studies: 121,700 women in the Nurses’ Health Study, 51,529 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, and 25,000 in the Women’s Genome Health Study. Participants completed questionnaires detailing their food and drink consumption over time.
“Dr. Qi and his colleagues have been able to do this study in a longitudinal way in this type of analysis,” said Ruth J. F. Loos, director of the Genetics of Obesity and Related Metabolic Traits Program at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. “This is a large study…It’s very well designed and well presented.”
The results indicated that the genetic effects on obesity risk and body mass index among those who drank one or more sugar-sweetened beverages per day were twice as large as those who consumed less than one serving per month.
“It’s hard to say that it’s a specific physiological effect of these sugar-sweetened beverages,” Loos said. “I think it’s that it’s an overall unhealthy lifestyle that makes them more genetically susceptible.”
Loos said that people who drank more sugar-sweetened beverages were often less active.
“They have a poor quality of diet and a high BMI, so you already see that sugar-sweetened beverages are actually maybe just a proxy for these effects.”
Qi said that they will continue to explore other genetic factors or dietary and lifestyle factors and their interactions in relation to obesity and other chronic diseases.
“[The study] should empower people who feel they are genetically susceptible, because it gives them evidence that something can be done about it,” Loos said. “If you have a healthy lifestyle, and if you reduce your consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, then you can suppress your genetic susceptibility.”

BOSTON, Mass.—Boston mayor Thomas M. Menino ended months of speculation Friday with an endorsement of Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren in her campaign to unseat Republican U.S. Senator Scott Brown. Looking out over a swollen crowd of cheering Warren supporters in Roslindale, Menino enthusiastically declared that Warren had his vote and full support.
“Elizabeth gets my appreciation every time she defends universal health care in ways that would make Teddy proud. And when she says government investment backs schools and hospitals and start-ups and starting over,” Menino said, referencing longtime U.S. Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56. “I got to know Elizabeth Warren, and now Elizabeth Warren’s got my vote, and she’s got my help.”
Political experts are already calling Menino’s much sought after endorsement a potential race-altering victory for Warren. As her campaign vies for the support of Boston’s union and socially-conservative voters, many of whom backed Brown two years ago, the endorsement of the popular pro-labor mayor could all but guarantee that support and bring much of the Boston electorate with it.
“As far as his affect on the race, it could be very significant. If he really puts his full organization behind her and they pull out all the stops to help her, that could make the difference in a close election,” Republican strategist Todd Domke said.
Menino’s backing has become viewed as something of a key to victory for politicians hoping to win in Massachusetts in recent years. Former Boston City Councillor Lawrence S. DiCara ’71 said the mayor’s organizational prowess and vast network of supporters make him an ideal ally for any campaign.
“This is for real. I think you will see the troops out there. What that means [is] that Elizabeth can turn some attention, redirect her field elsewhere,” DiCara said, while Menino takes care of Boston.
Menino, a Democrat, had been criticized by prominent members of his party prior to Friday’s endorsement for declining to takes sides in the highly contested race for Massachusetts junior U.S. Senate seat. Speculators pointed to the mayor’s close friendship with Brown as the likely hang-up in endorsing either candidate, suggesting the mayor’s prolonged silence was a de facto endorsement of Brown.
“I know Senator Brown. I like Senator Brown. But we disagree about some very basic, very important things. I think government should be in the business of helping people,” Menino told the crowd. That means creating jobs, protecting families from foreclosure, funding federal research for hospitals and universities, he added.
“Elizabeth got my approval when she backed the president’s job bills last fall. They would have supported thousands of jobs in Boston, but Scott Brown voted against all three,” Menino said.
The decision to hold Friday’s rally in Roslindale was symbolic as well as strategic for the Warren campaign. The southwest Boston neighborhood helped launch then-city councillor Menino to the mayor’s office 20 years ago. But Menino was also integral in helping to revive the neighborhood during the 1980s and 90s. In this political round, these neighborhoods will serve as a political litmus test to see whether Warren can win back some of the socially-conservative, working Democrats who backed Brown in 2010.
Though the supporters gathered in the small park here ranged from Warren die-hards to skeptical converts, the afternoon was unified under a marked pro-labor and pro-union sentiment. Union leaders representing healthcare and electrical workers spoke in advance of Menino and Warren.
“It's time for people to stand up and not believe that act. [Brown] believes in corporations, not people. It's time to realize the pendulum has swung way too far, and we're not taking it anymore,” International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers representative Michael Monahan told the crowd.
In the crowd, union carpenters, plumbers, and health care workers, among others, held signs and shouted out support for the Democratic leaders.
“She's for the working family, for union workers,” said John Flaherty, a union plumber. “We feel she's for us, so we're going to back her 100 percent.”
Though Brown seemed promising two years ago, Flaherty said, he failed to get the job done in Washington, backing corporate interests over the working man.
Billy Connely, a union carpenter, said that the only issue he cares about in the November election is jobs, and that he believes Warren is the best candidate to help create them. “Work, generating work. Keeping the working class working, that's about it,” he said.
Brown’s campaign has been just as active in courting working and middle class independents, holding numerous events in South Boston and other more socially conservative neighborhoods here. Jobs and the economy are often the focus of Brown advertising as well.

The Harvard Club of Boston settled a class action lawsuit with its wait staff last week, according to a letter to club members obtained by The Crimson.
The letter, which was signed by the Club’s president Nicholas J. Iselin ’87, said that, pending court approval, the Club will pay a total of $4 million to the members of the class and their attorneys.
The Harvard Club of Boston, a private business that is not affiliated with Harvard University, is open to graduates of Harvard and other “selected affiliate colleges and universities,” according to its website.
The Club’s wait staff employees filed a complaint last November in the Suffolk County Superior Court alleging that the club charges its patrons a “Club Charge,” but failed to disburse the funds to workers, in violation of tip laws in Massachusetts. The complaint claims these service charges were collected “in lieu of a gratuity.”
According to Iselin’s letter, the club—which has a no tipping policy--responded to the suit by clarifying on “all member documents” that what it calls a “Club Charge” is not a tip or gratuity.
“While we are confident the Harvard Club did nothing wrong, we could have done a few things better to ensure strict compliance with the Massachusetts tips statue,” the letter stated.
The letter said that the Club’s Board of Governors weighed the costs of a potentially “protracted legal battle” and decided that mediation was its best option.
“Ultimately, settling the lawsuit was a risk management decision on the part of the Club and a thoughtful attempt to avoid divisiveness among the staff over the issues,” the letter stated.
Shannon E. Liss-Riordan ’90, an attorney for the workers, said that she could not comment on specifics of the settlement but wrote that the case was “amicably resolved” in an email to the Crimson.
Brian Lang, the president of UNITE HERE! Local 26, the union that represents the Club’s service workers, as well Harvard dining workers, said that he was not surprised by the outcome of the case.
“Just from the facts as I knew them, I was very confident that the workers were going to prevail,” Lang said. “I’m pleased for the workers.”
Workers involved in the lawsuit were asked by attorneys not to comment on the case.
Lang said that the Massachusetts tip law, which has been imperiled in recent legislative battles, is crucial in the protection of service workers he represents.
“Thank god we have a strong law in Massachusetts that allows workers to get the money that gets ripped off from them by unscrupulous employers,” Lang said. “There are elected officials who don’t understand the importance of protecting this law—this is a good example of why that law is important to have.”
A spokesperson for the Club could not be reached for comment.
Its recently settled lawsuit is not the first time the Club has found itself in hot water for its relations with workers. Last Oct., the Club received a citation from the National Labor Relations Board for negotiating a contract “in bad faith.” The club and its workers came to an agreement on a new contract in early March after ten months of negotiations.

The Office of BGLTQ Student Life held its first official event of the school year on Sunday in honor of International Bi-Visibility and Celebrate Bisexuality Day.
At the event, students watched ‘Imagine Me and You,’ a comedy-romance film starring Piper L. Perabo and Matthew W. Goode, in which a newly-wed bride becomes infatuated with another woman. After the movie, the students engaged in an open discussion.
“We thought it would be a great way to get students talking about what it means to be bisexual and how the media portrays bisexuality,” Lynne Peskoe ’15, an intern at the office, said.
The celebration is only one of the many activities that the office has prepared for this semester.
“We have a number of key events this year, including our first large scale event on October 11th for National Coming Out Day,” Director of BGLTQ Student Life Vanidy “Van” Bailey said. “We are also excited about creating an advisory committee comprised of students, staff, faculty and alumni.”
The office, which opened formally last March, is currently welcoming visitors from 9:30 AM to 5:30 PM on Mondays to Fridays. It is staffed by eight undergraduate interns, each specializing in areas such as Campus Education and Special Projects, Programs and Events, Outreach to Houses and Student Organizations, and Marketing and Online Social Media.
Peskoe, who heads Programs and Events with Edith C. Benavides ‘14, said that the office provides plenty of support for the interns’ ideas and creativity.
“The office needs support from student interns because it needs people who know the queer environment at Harvard intimately,” she said.
In addition to these interns, the office will be working closely with the Harvard College Women’s Center and the Harvard Foundation to integrate an intersectional approach to diversity and social justice work at the college.
“I hope the office helps foster a campus environment that creates space for all genders and sexualities to feel a part of the Harvard College community,” Bailey said.
Another office intern, Griffin T. Gaffney ’13, said that the office has already helped build a remarkable sense of community, with students ducking in and out throughout the day.
“I strongly encourage people to come visit us down in the basement of Boylston Hall, be it for a quick cup of tea, for a lengthy discussion of BGLTQ issues, or just to hang out on our couches.”

Jessica T. Mathews ’67 and Theodore V. Wells, Jr., have been selected as the newest members of the Harvard Corporation announced Sunday.
The expansion of the Corporation is part of a multi-year restructuring that includes the imposition of term limits and an increase of its membership from seven to 13 members. The Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, is the oldest corporate body in the western hemisphere.
Mathews currently works as the president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and previously served on the Board of Trustees at Radcliffe College. Wells co-chairs the litigation department at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, a top New York law firm. He holds degrees from both Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School.
“We are very pleased to welcome these two distinguished alumni to the Corporation, both of whom will expand our capacity and contribute important and distinctive perspectives to our work,” University President Drew G. Faust and senior fellow of the Corporation Robert D. Reischauer ’63 wrote in a joint statement.
“My perspective on all this is that there’s more positive change at Harvard in the past three or four years than there’s been in the past few decades,” Reischauer said in a phone interview Sunday evening.
According to Reischauer, the Corporation conducted an internal evaluation of its progress in making the structural changes, “just to make sure we weren’t looking in the mirror saying how handsome we were.”
The University announced modifications to Corporation's organizational structure in 2010 in an effort to increase transparency and better align itself with the governing structures of other universities. The Corporation, whose structure has remained the same throughout its 300 year history, says that its expansion will allow the body to draw on a more diverse range of knowledge and experience in making decisions.
Faust and Reischauer said that the expertise of Mathews and Wells will be valuable assets for the University. In a statement, Matthews said she believes that her knowledge of international issues will be helpful to Harvard as education becomes globally-focused.
“The world of education is globalizing, with consequences as profound as those for government and business,” she said. “Having spent more than a decade building a global think tank, I look forward to helping think through this great university’s international role and contributing all I can to the full range of the Corporation’s work.”
In addition to his highly regarded work in corporate law, Wells previously served as the chairman of the board of directors at the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Legal Defense and Educational Fund. He also has been active in politics, working as the national treasurer for Bill Bradley’s 2000 presidential run.
“Education opens minds and expands opportunities, and nothing matters more to me,” Wells said in a statement. “I greatly look forward to serving a university that has helped shape my own outlook and aspirations, and to supporting the work of people across Harvard whose ideas and efforts do so much to better the world.”
According to the new rules, Corporation members serve a six-year term with the possibility of a one term extension. The Mathews and Wells appointments will begin with the start of the 2013 calendar year and last six years, with the possibility of a six-year extension.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Osushi, a Japanese restaurant in Copley Square, will open a second location in Cambridge during the first week of Oct. in the space previously occupied by Conga, a tapas restaurant on the corner of Winthrop and Eliot Streets.
“We wanted to bring a bigger, bolder Japanese restaurant to Harvard Square,” Boston-native and franchise partner Tim Panagopoulos said.
After renovations to the space, Osushi will feature minimalist furniture, dark wood tables, and two bars—one for sushi and another for drinks—to create a clean, organized space that Panagopoulos described as “very feng shui.”
According to Panagopoulos, Harvard Square currently lacks a restaurant offering a full menu of Japanese entrees. “There’s no similar cuisine in the square,” he said.
At their Copley location, the restaurant served mainly sushi and tempura, but after extensive renovations and a considerable investment, the new space now has the ventilation to support a full kitchen capable of producing a wide range of dishes.
“We can finally present real Japanese entrees, meat and noodle dishes, and elegant savory options,” Panagopoulos said.
The price of sushi dishes range from approximately $4 to $12. Osushi will also serve drinks, including sake with exotic flavors like pear or mandarin orange. When asked if Osushi would feature sake bombing, a popular pull for some Harvard students, Panagopoulos chuckled.
“We’ll serve sake and we’ll serve beer; what our patrons do with it is up to them,” he said.
The project has been in the works for a year but Panagopoulos said that he quickly capitalized on the opportunity to expand to Harvard Square when the location became available. “It’s all about timing in the restaurant business,” he said.
Panagopoulos hopes that the restaurant’s prominent location will attract students, business travellers, and tourists to the Harvard Square location. Despite other sushi restaurants in the Square, Panagopoulos seemed unconcerned by the competition and listed Osushi’s expanded menu, unique décor, and moderate prices as a draw for patrons in the Square.
The restaurant will remain open until 2 a.m. nightly.

Audience members gathered to commemorate what would have been the 100th birthday of American chef, author, and television personality Julia Child at an event hosted by The Schlesinger Library at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study last Friday.
“Siting Julia” included remarks from authors, producers, and restaurateurs. Speakers focused on discussing three “sites” that Child inhabited, learned from, and influenced: post-World War II Paris, Cambridge, Mass., and national television. The addresses also touched upon how Child, in making French cuisine accessible to ordinary Americans, inadvertently influenced men and women alike.
In her welcoming remarks, Dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study Lizabeth Cohen noted Child’s role in changing how the public approached the development of culinary skills.
“[She was famous for] promoting the idea that cooking can be taught [and that] cooking is a science,” she said.
Keynote speaker Laura Shapiro ’68 said that, despite Child’s unassuming style of instruction in print and on television, her fame impacted the construction of gender norms.
“She was never narcissistic,” she said. “She taught Americans how to cook and how to think [about women in the kitchen.]”
“No one ever called Julia a ‘little woman,’” Shapiro added.
Audience members, many of whom personally witnessed her rise to fame, credited Child with provoking a profound societal shift in thought with regards to conventional roles within the home.
Priscilla F. Kauff ’62 said that Child redefined cooking as a career and art form, rather than as a domestic duty.
“[She] legitimized and raised the level of cooking so, as a woman, you didn’t have to feel it was demeaning to cook,” she said.
Kauff added that Child’s television show, which she first encountered while learning how to cook for herself after graduation, also captured her husband’s interest at the time.
Kennie S. Lyman ’62 said that Child did not conform to traditional gender stereotypes of the time.
“[Child] was so radically different from the concept of the wife who had dinner ready,” she said.
Speakers introduced a song written by the late Rev. Peter J. Gomes entitled “O Julia Child.” The lyrics were projected onto a screen, accompanied by a piano. Audience members joined together in song to celebrate Child’s life and legacy.
The event, due to popularity, was broadcast online and at several locations on campus. Audience members also Tweeted alongside the webcast.
The Schlesinger Library houses Child’s extensive papers, in addition to the photographs, audio, and video of and about Amelia M. Earhart, Betty Friedan, June M. Jordan, Adrienne C. Rich, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Dorothy West, and other less well-known women.

For the first time, the School of Engineering and Applied Science is accepting applications for its new graduate degree programs in Computational Science and Engineering. Students can now apply to pursue a Master of Science or a Master of Engineering in the field.
The new programs were introduced in an attempt to address the growing demand for advanced computational skills in a number of fields.
“Computational science is being regarded as the third way of approaching science—the other two being theory and experimentation,” said professor Efthimios Kaxiras, director of the Institute for Applied Computational Science. “It’s more and more important for data analysis today.”
Applications to the programs are open to new and current SEAS graduate students, as well as undergraduates pursuing the AB/SM combined bachelor’s and master’s degree.
Developments are also underway to extend the program to the undergraduate level through the creation of a new undergraduate secondary in the coming years.
“We definitely want to satisfy the interest expressed by undergraduates students in the field. At the moment, we’re working to make sure everything is in place,” Kaxiras said.
According to SEAS Dean Cherry A. Murray, formal training in computational science and engineering has traditionally been lacking at the university level.
“It’s true that the national labs and industry are way ahead of academia in terms of dealing with huge amounts of data, “ said Murray. “Universities aren’t really training people who are able to handle that computational need. We aim to change that.”
Thirteen students enrolled in the graduate secondary field program in computational science when it was introduced last year. According to Cherry, the classes have received a positive response so far.
SEAS Communications Director Michael P. Rutter said that much of the demand has come from current graduate students who wish to apply computational analysis to fields such as systems biology and design.
Ru Sun, a SEAS Ph.D  student, said that she felt the new program would assist her in conducting her own research.
“It’s an extension of study in my field and the background will be helpful when I try to find a job,” said Sun.
The programs’ curricula will include lectures from professionals at national labs and in the technical industry. Murray said that she hopes that the programs will serve to train future employees in these fields.
“[The new field] is really serving Harvard in a good way. It’s enabling students to do a lot more,” said Rutter.

With their political platforms established, U.S. Senator Scott Brown and Democratic challenger Elizabeth Warren turned their attention to political name-calling and campaign-trail narratives in the first debate in Massachusetts race for U.S. Senate last week.
Though much of Thursday’s hour-long debate was spent arguing over taxes, jobs bills, student loans, and energy, political experts said the campaigns were more interested in the tone they could set for the campaign trail than parsing out policy.
“Issue-wise, I don't think there was much new from the debate,” said Republican strategist Todd Domke. “We knew where they agreed and where they disagreed. We knew before how Brown would try to sound similar to [Warren] on social issues, and how they would argue the tax questions.”
Their divergent goals allowed both campaigns to claim victory, but three days after the debate, political analysts say the night belonged to Harvard Law School professor Warren.
“She certainly has momentum,” Democratic political strategist Mary Anne Marsh said after the debate.
From the outset Brown questioned Warren’s character. In response to moderator Jon Keller’s first questions about character, he repeatedly asked Warren explain why she had identified herself as Native American while a professor at Harvard and Penn. Brown suggested that this labeling constituted an unfair advantage by an out-of-touch professor—a narrative he returned to throughout the night.
But the centerpiece of the his attack was Warren’s involvement in a 2009 Supreme Court case where she argued on behalf of Travelers Insurance Company. That case ruled that Travelers, and the asbestos companies it represented, would settle with asbestos victims through a general fund outside of court. Brown argued that Warren had fought against victims and on behalf of corporate interests.
Though the claims gained little traction in the debate, Domke said he doubts they will not be going away anytime soon.
“He didn't have a success how they had hoped, but he has the resources to force the issue,” Domke said. “What he couldn't do in the debate or post-debate publicity, he can do in advertising.”
Warren, a novice debater, had less ambitious goals for the evening, experts said. She focused on the incumbent’s voting record, painting Brown as a corporate booster who has forgotten the best interest of the people of Massachusetts.
“[Brown] came out of the gate very, very strong and went right after Elizabeth Warren, but I think she also, when she got her footing—and she did it very quickly—went after him as well. And I think she was very effective going after his votes,” Marsh said.
Warren spent much of the latter half of the debate emphasizing the race’s national importance. She said a vote for Brown is a vote for the Republican party and its right-wing conservative leaders.
“Whenever she mentioned Obama that was a benefit to her. Whenever she reminded people that Scott Brown is a Republican and Republicans could take over the Senate, that hurts Scott Brown,” Marsh said.
Whether or not Democratic momentum will be enough to carry Warren through to November is less certain. Analysts said both candidates will likely have to pay closer attention to the issues next time around and improve their performance before the next debate, which is scheduled for Oct. 1 in Lowell.
“I think that both of them have a challenge remembering that even though we've come a long way as a country, Brown cannot appear to be beating up on the grandmother, and Elizabeth has to be careful not to be too preachy or too professorial,” former Boston city councillor Lawrence S. DiCara ’71 said.

The physics department has restructured its introductory physics curriculum to remove overlap between courses and to offer students diversity in teaching methodology.
The Physics 11 series will be offered for the last time this school year. The department will replace the course with a new divisional science course called Physical Sciences 12: “Mechanics from an Analytic, Numerical and Experimental Perspective” this spring that will cover many of the topics currently taught in Physics 11.
Even though Physics 11 will be phased out, students wishing to take introductory physics will have a variety of options to choose from based on level of difficulty and area of focus.
Prospective physics concentrators also have the option to enroll in either the Physics 15 series or the faster-paced Physics 16. Physical Sciences 2 and 3 are targeted towards life science concentrators. The newly introduced Applied Physics 50 is an application-based physics course primarily targeting prospective engineering concentrators.
“One of our goals is to differentiate these courses from one another to a greater degree than has been the case in the past,” said physics professor Christopher W. Stubbs.
“The hope is to improve both the diversity of selections that we offer to students and strengthen the science curriculum across the board,” he added.
The new changes—including the discontinuation of Physics 11—came as a surprise to many students. The department decided to offer the course for a final time this coming spring to ensure that students would be able to meet concentration requirements.
“The changes seemed so sudden. I talked to a few professors in the department, and even they said these things were happening really quickly,” said Calvin Tonini ’15, who switched from Physics 15a to Physics 11a this fall.
The shift from Physics 11 to Physical Sciences 12 reflects the department’s broader objective of preparing students with a strong foundation in quantitative scientific reasoning. Professors hope to teach student to embrace numerical methods and computers as tools for modeling systems, analyzing data from experiments, and doing statistical comparisons between the two, Stubbs said.
“We don’t just want students to learn introductory physics,” Stubbs said. “In this day and age, the sooner students become proficient with powerful computing tools, the better off they will be when pursuing technical studies.”
This new focus will be incorporated into Physics 11a this semester. Students will be required to utilize a variety of numerical methods to analyze and model physical phenomena.
“We’re doing some very cool things that haven’t really been done in the class before such as solving problems through Matlab modeling,” said Tonini.
Professors across the department hope that the program will evolve and develop to best address students’ needs.
“I’m not for a second going to assert that we’re going to get this right the first time through, but we certainly intend to iterate our way towards success,” Stubbs said.

President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj of Mongolia discussed corruption, human rights, and his success in revitalizing his home country at the Institute of Politics on Friday.
Championing the cause of the peaceful democratic revolution he launched to overthrow the long-standing communist regime in Mongolia, Elbegdorj offered a forceful diatribe against the widespread corruption in government that he successfully fought against, twice as prime minister and now as president.
Speaking to a packed audience in the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum, Elbegdorj dubbed Mongolia as the current world leader in freedom, referring to it as the “democratic anchor of the east.” He encouraged
other nations to follow suit and forge a policy to support “human rights, openness, and justice.”
Having graduated from the Harvard Kennedy School with a Masters in Public Administration in 2002, Elbegdorj called it a “high honor to return to Harvard” after ten years. He stated that he “still ran on
Harvard fuel” even now as a head of state. Elbegdorj also referenced Harvard landmarks like the COOP in his speech.
“Ten years ago, I bought t-shirts for me,” he said. “Now...I bought some t-shirts for myself and my children—25 t-shirts,” he added to laughter, referencing his five biological and 20 adopted children.
Elbegdorj also noted the strong diplomatic ties between the United States and Mongolia. He mentioned one incident in which he had to write a letter to prevent a stolen Mongolian dinosaur fossil from being auctioned off in America. Upon recounting this incident to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, he said to her, “Now, in this age, we only have one dinosaur—called corruption.”
Elbegdorj also took the time to poke fun at the popular photograph of multiple heads of state, in which President Barack Obama accidentally blocked Elbegdorj’s face when waving his hand at the camera. The photo went viral in the fall of 2011.
“President Obama’s hand can cover my face, but his hand is not going to cover my country,” he said.
Among the audience members were former governor of Massachusetts, William F. Weld ’66, former prime minister of Greece, Georgios A. Papandreou, and former President of Ecuador, J. Jamil Mahuad.
Mahuad noted the importance of having three heads of states at one event, but also mentioned the pleasure he received from seeing Elbegdorj, a former classmate of his in HKS.
Papandreou emphasized that “democracy is an ongoing struggle” and that the corruption in politics is an issue common to many nations, echoing Elbegdorj’s idea that “democracy is a learned process.”
‘“We need to make sure that people have the power and that there is transparency and accountability in government,” he added.
In an interview with The Crimson, Elbegdorj stressed the importance of personal liberty in a free and democratic country. Elbegdorj mentioned how the “love of personal freedom” was a strong theme is his life even from childhood where he was one of eight children. Elbegdorj also explained Mongolia’s strategy for the Olympics, a source of pride for Mongolians given that the 2012 London Olympics was the most successful
in the nation’s history.
“I made a very historic decision,” he said. “Every month, we will give cash to our athletes for their lifetime if they get medals in the Olympic games.”

When ‘The Amazing Race: China Rush’ sent its contestants to a region near the Chinese-Korean border and challenged them to down 1.2 kilograms of Kimchi, most teams became frantic. Charles R. Melvoin ’10 and Ryan K. Burke ’10, on the other hand, quietly drew back their chairs, thanked the servers, and finished the fire-hot Korean dish in under fifteen minutes.
“I found myself with Ryan, constantly reflecting upon our performance and strategizing for the coming challenges,” Melvoin said. “Knowing that at that point in the race there should have been an eating challenge, we didn’t eat a lot of breakfast that day.”
While the U.S. version of ‘The Amazing Race’ brings U.S. citizens to exotic locations around the globe, ‘The Amazing Race: China Rush’ takes international contestants to obscure locations within China and challenges them to engage with local customs, whether that be eating Kimchi or rounding up ducks.
The third season of ‘The Amazing Race: China Rush’ features five Chinese teams, five foreign teams, and one team consisting of a foreigner and a Chinese citizen. All of the teammates have known each other for at least three years. Melvoin and Burke, whose team name is the ‘Harvard Boys,’ met their freshman year, having been randomly assigned as roommates in Greenough.
For Burke and Melvoin, the tangible prize of the competition—a trip around the world valued at $60,000—was the least appealing aspect of the show. According to Melvoin, what instead compelled the two to apply for a spot was the opportunity to travel to little known areas of a country that fascinated them both.
Melvoin’s love for China began at when he was 12 years old, when he began studying Mandarin, under a teacher who had left China at the start of the Cultural Revolution.
“Now, Chinese classes are absolutely saturated with students,” Melvoin said. “But to be one of only a few and to receive that kind of attention from a pretty incredible intellectual who had left China was really special.”
After graduation from the College, Melvoin completed a Masters in development with a focus on China at the University of Cambridge. He moved to Beijing in 2011 to work for Baidu, the Chinese equivalent of Google.
The route to China was less direct for Burke. Having enjoyed the gap year he spent backpacking through Asia, he said he searched for job opportunities abroad senior year. When an offer arose in Shanghai, he jumped at the chance, although he knew little more Mandarin than “ni hao.”
The decision to bring the “Harvard Boys” onto the show hinged on both their enthusiasm for Chinese culture and the Harvard brand name, according to Rachel Berkley, a casting director and story editor for ‘The Amazing Race: China Rush.’ She said she had imagined that the idea of Harvard graduates coming to China to restart their lives would be appealing to Chinese viewers.
“Many Chinese people, they might not know anything about Western culture or America, but they know the name Harvard,” said Berkley.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Sept. 24
An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a casting director and story editor for ‘The Amazing Race: China Rush.’ It is Rachel Berkley, not Rachel Berkeley.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PROVIDENCE, R.I.—The first drive of Saturday’s contest at Brown couldn’t have gone much worse for the Harvard football team.
On just the Bears’ second play from scrimmage, Crimson sophomore Norman Hayes stumbled and fell, giving Brown wide receiver Jonah Fay enough open space to create crop circles. Six plays after that 43-yard gain, and 3:59 into the contest, and the Bears had blitzkrieged into the end zone. Just like that, Brown 7, Harvard 0.
For those who followed the Crimson last season, an early deficit shouldn’t be that surprising. In the team’s seven league games in 2011, five times it trailed out of the gates.
But of course, in each, it didn’t take long for the Crimson, the Usain Bolt of the Ivy League, to catch up, blow by, and cross the finish line far ahead of its outclassed competition. The offense just had too much horsepower, the defense just too dominant. After all, both finished tops in the Ancient Eight a season ago, and so their combination? Purely lethal.
And to some extent, we saw that phenomenon on Saturday afternoon at Brown Stadium. After that early Bears score, the Crimson, like clockwork, struck back.
With a field goal less than six minutes later and two touchdowns early in the second quarter, Harvard grabbed the 17-7 edge and held the advantage the rest of the way. When the clock struck midnight, the Crimson emerged with a 45-31 victory, extending a bevy of unbeaten streaks, including nine straight wins in league play.
And just as the storyline was similar to those games a season ago, so too was Harvard’s offensive dominance. Indeed, on Saturday, we got a glimpse of what we saw so much last season: an offense just too hot to handle, an attack with more ways to beat you than Bobby Fischer.
Senior quarterback Colton Chapple dissected the Bears’ defense, throwing for 351 yards and completing 75 percent of his passes. And while he certainly wasn’t perfect, Chapple missed, by and large, the right kind of way, throwing it so that if his receiver couldn’t get to it, then neither could the Brown defensive back.
It was not too surprising that the senior didn’t have an interception in 40 pass attempts.
And at his disposal, Chapple has a dizzying array of weapons, as we saw again Saturday.
Acrobats like sophomore Seitu Smith II, whose leaping, leave-your-mouth-wide-open grab over Brown All-American AJ Cruz gave the Crimson that 17-7 lead.
Bulldozers like senior Kyle Juszczyk, who tallied 86 receiving yards and at one point leapfrogged an opposing defender.
Precisionists like junior Andrew Berg—Chapple called him “one of the best route-runners we’ve had here, at Harvard, in a long time”—who hauled in a 35-yard completion, the longest for the Crimson on the day.
Of course, at this point in the year, senior running back Treavor Scales has to be front and center in any discussion of the offense. Because after a career-high 173 rushing yards a week ago, Scales somehow, inexplicably, one-upped himself, running for 136 yards and a career-high four touchdowns. That left him one shy of the 60-year-old Crimson record.
But it wasn’t all rainbows and ponies for Harvard. Unlike last season’s storyline, the Crimson defense struggled mightily against a tough Brown attack. Like last week, Harvard allowed over 325 yards through the air, with senior quarterback Patrick Donnelly bullying and picking apart the Crimson secondary, at points seemingly moving the Bears down the field as he pleased.
And though Harvard allowed 31 points, that number just as easily could have been 38, with the Bears’ final drive stalled near the goal line as time winded down.
Indeed, in Saturday’s offensive gunfight, when Brown Stadium became the O.K. Corral, when at one point, seven of eight drives between the two teams culminated in touchdowns, the Crimson came up with enough stops to get the job done.
“We’ve got some work to do. There’s no question,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “And we’ll get better. We have been kind of a bend-but-don’t-break team, and we want to be a team that can be a shutdown team.”
That bend-but-don’t-break mentality worked well enough against Brown. It will probably work well enough next week against Holy Cross, which now has lost to both Brown and Dartmouth.
But it may not work so well two weeks from now against Cornell—which made Yale look silly this weekend in a 45-6 romp—and its quarterback Jeff Mathews, who’s averaging 415 passing yards per game.
So in a fortnight, if the secondary doesn’t shore up soon, the bend-but-don’t-break approach may just, well, snap.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PROVIDENCE, R.I.—A Brown touchdown with minutes remaining in the third quarter left the Harvard football team entrenched in its second straight battle heading into the fourth quarter.
Last week, the Crimson was down six. This week, it held a seven-point advantage with 15 minutes remaining in the contest.
Despite differing circumstances, Harvard’s offensive performance in the final quarter was the same both times: 21 game-clinching points.
“We have the ability to run it and throw it and wear down the defense as the game goes on,” senior center Jack Holuba said.
The Crimson started off the fourth quarter with a six-yard scamper by senior quarterback Colton Chapple to take a two-touchdown lead. After Brown responded with seven points of its own, senior Treavor Scales broke a 41-yard run to regain the 14-point advantage.
A methodical Harvard drive following a Brown punt ended with another Scales touchdown that put the game away.
Scales finished the fourth quarter with 71 yards in the frame while Chapple threw for over 100 yards and had only one incompletion over the final fifteen minutes of action.
Everything seemed to click down the stretch. With the comfort of a lead, Crimson coach Tim Murphy was able to employ a balanced offense that proved unstoppable.
Chapple and Scales’ impressive synchronization late in the game was encapsulated by a third-quarter option call in the red zone.
The play is typically tricky to pull off with every defender crammed in a tight space in front of their goal line, but the two seniors ran it to near perfection. Chapple slid left and drew to defenders before pitching the ball to Scales, who found a hole just large enough to get into the end zone.
SAY IT AIN’T SEITU
Don’t ever call sophomore Seitu Smith II just a slot receiver or returner again. Without returning a punt for more than a couple yards, Smith played a major role in the Crimson’s offensive performance, and not just with his breakaway speed.
On Harvard’s first third-down attempt, a third-and-eight at its own 29, Chapple connected with Smith for a 15-yard gain. That completion was an early indicator of Smith’s growing role in the Crimson attack.
“We have to keep broadening his role,” Murphy said. “Besides being a talented, fast kid, he’s so competitive. He’s a very tough, physical kid—he’s not your average slot receiver.”
Smith cemented himself as one of Chapple’s leading targets a period later as Harvard started its drive on the Brown 30 following a turnover and penalty. Chapple dropped back and waited for Smith to gain a step on preseason All-American cornerback AJ Cruz. When Smith gained no more than a few inches of separation, Chapple tossed the ball beyond the front pylon, where his wideout snatched it from the air for a touchdown.
“Having those types of weapons where you can throw the ball and [Smith] comes down with a 30-yard touchdown…it’s a huge momentum shift,” Chapple said. “It was great to see him get out there and make plays.”
Smith finished the day leading the team with eight catches and 92 yards, both career highs.
SECOND-RATE SECONDARY
While the Harvard offense was tearing apart the Bears’ defense, the Crimson secondary struggled to keep the home team off the board.
Brown quarterback Patrick Donnelly finished the contest with 336 yards and three touchdowns on 27-of-40 passing as Harvard gave up more than 325 yards in the air for the second straight week.
Cornerbacks fell down and were beaten by receivers, and Connelly found holes in both the Crimson’s zone and man-to-man defenses.
The Harvard secondary has faltered in  the absence of veteran cornerback Brian Owusu, who has been sidelined in the first two games due to lingering hamstring issues.
With a game against Cornell and reigning Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year and quarterback Jeff Mathews looming in two weeks, the unit must tighten up or risk being exposed by the top signal caller in the conference.
“When people spread you out today, it’s tough to defend them,” Murphy said. “There are plenty of things that we need to work on, and that’s one of them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s tennis team hit the road this past weekend to open its first competitive play of the year, contending in a pair of tournaments in New York and California.
Most of the team traveled to play in the USTA College Invitational in Flushing, N.Y., against players from other northeastern schools, including Ivy League competitors Yale, Columbia, Princeton, and Dartmouth. Meanwhile four players from the team traveled across the country to play in the Napa Valley Tournament against players from some of the top Division I schools in the nation.
USTA COLLEGE INVITATIONAL
At the USTA College Invitational, Crimson players competed in a ladder tournament in both singles and doubles.
“[The freshmen] played really well and handled the situation well,” co-captain Andy Nguyen said. “It was really just about getting out there and playing matches, really, nothing more—getting out there to tune things up”
Freshman Nicholas Hu made it the farthest of any Crimson player, winning his first match of the day, 6-0, 6-1, against Justin Hagan from Sacred Heart. He later upset the No. 4 seed, Bert Vancura, 6-3, 6-1, before eventually losing in the semifinals to the No. 1 seed, Mike Lampa, 6-2, 7-6 (2). Sophomore Henry Steer and junior Brendan Seaver both faced off against Princeton players in their first round matches, getting a chance to play Ivy League rivals before conference play begins in the spring.
Steer, the No. 1 seed in his bracket, split sets against the Tigers’ Augie Bloom before falling in a super tiebreak, 4-6, 7-5 (10-1). Seaver, playing Benjamin Quazzo, was barely edged out as well, losing in a super tiebreak, 6-1, 3-6 (10-8).
In doubles, Harvard was more successful. The tandem of Freshman Nicholas Mahlangu and Nguyen, seeded third in the top flight, won its two opening matches before falling to a Fairfield doubles team, 8-2. Seaver and Steer did just as well, advancing to the quarterfinals in their bracket, before losing, 8-6, to Billy Bishop and Dalen Klassen from Marist. Hu and Kevin Lam, seeded third in their flight, lost in the first round, 8-6, to their Yale counterparts, but gained some valuable experience, according to Nguyen.
“We’re sort of just trying to get the positions down,” Nguyen said. “Some of the freshmen are a little inexperienced with the doubles plays we have, so we just needed this weekend to work on doubles finishing and little things.”
NAPA VALLEY TOURNAMENT
Junior co-captain Casey MacMaster and sophomores Shaun Chaudhuri, Denis Nguyen and Alex Steinroeder traveled to Napa Valley to compete against a fleet of schools, including California, Texas, Stanford, Georgia, and Illinois. The winner of the tournament automatically qualified for a wild-card spot in a United States Tennis Association Pro Circuit event. The classic invited eight of the top under-18 ranked players in the nation.
“It was kind of a blast from the past,” McMaster said. “A lot of our recruits were high ranked juniors so it was good that we got to play against them. I was very impressed with the level of play they brought out to college matches.”
The first day featured a string of Crimson losses. Steinroeder and Denis Nguyen both fell to players from University of Texas, with Steinroeder falling, 6-1, 6-1 to Sudanwa Sitaram and Nguyen losing, 6-3, 7-5 to Soren Hess-Olesen. MacMaster and Chaudhuri both lost in three sets, MacMaster to Brian Page from Illinois and Chaudhuri to Robbie Bellamy, a junior currently ranked 11th in the country among his age cohort.
In doubles, Chaudhuri and Steinroder fell, 9-7, to junior players Jack Murray and Joseph Digiulio, although the tandem of Nguyen and Macmaster defeated Lloyd Glasspool and Hess Olesen, 9-8(7), from Texas.
“I thought we played really well considering how we had no match play so far going into it,” sophomore Denis Nguyen said. “We lacked match experience, and that’s something we’re going to have to work on [after we get back].”
The second day of play brought with it similar defeats as each of the four Harvard players was knocked off in two sets. In doubles, Steinroeder and Chaudhuri fell to Brian Page and Stephen Hoh from the University of Illinois, 8-4.
The third and last day of competition saw Steinroeder, Chaudhuri, and Nguyen go up against three of the top ranked players in the competition, with each player losing in three long sets.
“I was really happy with our team, especially going into our first tournament and having to go up against the top three or four players in the country as well as some of the best teams that were out here this weekend,” MacMaster said. “Even without a lot of match experience, it was good that we could go out there and hang with those guys.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amidst windy conditions, the Harvard women’s golf team finished third at this weekend’s Yale Women’s Fall Intercollegiate tournament.
In the field of 16 at The Course, the Bulldogs’ home venue, the Crimson finished ahead of all five other Ivy League teams that competed and was bested only by Nova Southeastern and Penn State.
Harvard recorded an overall score of 886 (+22), coming within a single stroke of second place.
Four Crimson golfers finished in the top 20 individually.
Sophomore Tiffany Lim took fifth place with a score of 218 (+2), junior captain Bonnie Hu—who won last year’s Ivy League Championships—tied for 11th with sophomore teammate Brenna Nelsen at six over par.
“We have a great team this year and I think this is a good indicator of how we will do going forward,” said Hu, who is also a Crimson business editor.
The Crimson won the tournament by 16 strokes last fall, when Lim—last year’s Ivy League Rookie of the Year­—tied for first place at two over par with Yale’s Seo Hee Moon.
This year, Moon finished in a tie for 17th, seven strokes behind Lim. The Bulldogs notched a team score of 909 (+45).
After Friday’s play, Harvard was in second place with a first-day score of 298 (+10), trailing Nova Southeastern by six strokes.
But the Crimson could not hold its position for long as the Nittany Lions passed Harvard on Saturday. The team fell 13 strokes further behind Nova Southeastern after Nova shot a 281, 10 shots lower than any other team notched in a single round all weekend.
Freshman Christine Lin led the Crimson with a 72 on Saturday, her best day of the weekend. Lin’s lowest single-round score tied for the team’s best individual round after Nelsen and Lim both shot 72 on Sunday.
“I think the key thing is to stay patient and stay within yourself,” Lin said. “Don’t worry about the things that you cannot control… focus one shot at a time and bring that confidence and commitment to every shot.”
In its ninth year under head coach Kevin Rhoads, Harvard brought no seniors to its first tournament of the season, adding Lin and fellow freshman Courtney Hooton.
Lin comes to Harvard highly touted. Chosen by Golf World as one of its 50 players to watch in 2012, the freshman was ranked 10th in the country coming into the season, adding to Harvard’s history of impact freshman brought in under Rhoads’ leadership.
“It was a great team experience,” said Lin of her first collegiate event. “We have a tournament next week, and I definitely want to take this as a starting point for this year.”
The Crimson is entering the season as the defending Ivy League champion and has won three of the past five titles. Harvard finished 23 strokes ahead of Yale and 33 strokes ahead of Princeton, beating out the other two lowest scoring Ivy League competitors in the sixteen-team field.
“Our team is a lot stronger this year and we have five girls who in any given round could be leading,” Hu said. “In practice, even though everyone is working on different things and what area of their game they need to improve, when we play the course, we definitely push each other.”
On the weekend, the team posted consistent individual scores in the 70s on the par-72 course. Only one Crimson golfer had a round over 80—Hooten’s 81 on Sunday.
“The Yale course is a tough course and I think any score in the mid-to-low 70s is a good score,” Hu said. “For me personally, being able to shoot 75 is a good confidence booster going into the season, and it’s nice to know that you’re coming back from summer and after a couple weeks of practice you’re already ready to go.”
The Crimson will enter its second round of competition this weekend at the Nittany Lion Women’s Invitational.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time Harvard men’s water polo won six consecutive games, Class of 2016 attackers Ben Zepfel, Blake Lee, and Noah Harrison were probably studying their multiplication tables.
A young Harvard men’s water polo team completed an historic weekend sweep Sunday to open CWPA conference play.  With four wins in three days, the Crimson (9-5) earned its first six-game winning streak since 2002.
“Our goal going into this weekend was to go 4-0,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said following the Crimson’s 11-3 win over Iona Saturday night.
A core of talented freshmen helped propel Harvard to a hard-fought away victory over MIT (4-6) on Friday night, and the Crimson carried the momentum into a Saturday double-header for a pair of home wins against Fordham (1-10) and Iona (1-8).  Harvard rounded out the sweep Sunday at Connecticut College, winning 14-9.
Minnis was pleased with the manner in which the Crimson controlled the pace of its games.
“We’re working very hard on the defensive end, not chasing after goals and letting the offense come,” Minnis said.
HARVARD 14, CONNECTICUT COLLEGE 9
The Crimson buried the Camels early in a Sunday matinee at Connecticut College’s Jane Cadwell Lott Natatorium.  Harvard scored the first four goals of the game to coast to a sixth consecutive win.
Zepfel tallied his fourth hat trick of the winning streak, and fellow freshman attacker Harrison also chipped in three goals.  On defense, freshman Lee led the Crimson with four steals.  Freshman goalie Colin Woolway made nine saves.
Connecticut College is now 0-17 against Harvard all-time.
HARVARD 11, IONA 3
In the second game of Saturday’s home double-header, the Crimson recorded a season-high 17 steals to stifle the Iona attack.
The Gaels managed only 14 shots on goal, while Harvard’s Zepfel and sophomore attacker Max Murphy earned hat tricks, and Lee had a team-leading four picks.  Junior goalie Jimmy Field made 11 saves.
“Overall, our defense is looking really good,” Murphy said.  “We’re shutting teams down, and that’s what we wanted to work on [and] wanted to improve on the most.”
The Crimson held Iona scoreless in the second half save a late fourth quarter goal.
“We were making them earn every inch that they tried to get in the pool, and I think that’s a big part of what we want to do here going forward,” Minnis said.
HARVARD 12, FORDHAM 7
On Saturday afternoon at Blodgett, the Crimson jumped out to a 2-1 lead midway through the first quarter and never gave it up in a dominant victory.
Harvard yielded few offensive opportunities to Fordham as junior co-captain Will Roller led the Crimson in scoring with a hat trick.  Five Harvard goals in the third quarter, including a pair of successful penalty shots by Zepfel, put the game out of reach.
Harvard’s coach saw improvements as the game progressed.
“Energy-wise in the first half we weren’t clicking.  We let in a couple of goals we probably should have stopped,” Minnis said.  “We made some adjustments at half time, and we came out and did a better job on the defensive end.”
HARVARD 13, MIT 12
The Crimson outlasted the Engineers before a spirited crowd at MIT’s Zesiger Aquatic Center Friday night.
The two squads battled to a 7-7 tie in the first half before Harvard broke away in the third frame, outscoring MIT 4-1.  The Crimson added two more goals in the fourth quarter to hold off a late MIT surge.
The clangs of pots and pans filled the air as members of MIT’s Delta Upsilon fraternity chapter cheered on brothers playing for the Engineers.
“It was impossible to hear anything in the pool,” Murphy said.  “I think it made us come together as team, because you really have to rely on communication in the pool and communication between players when you’re in an atmosphere like that.”
With the win, Harvard draws even with MIT in the teams’ season series.  The Crimson suffered a 19-7 rout at the hands of the Engineers on Sept. 1, but on Friday, the MIT offense managed only one even-strength goal.
Zepfel led the Crimson on both sides of the ball with four goals and four steals.  Lee and Roller each contributed two goals and four assists to the effort.  Goalies Field and Woolway combined for seven saves.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With 20 seconds left in the second period and the score tied at zero, it looked as if the Harvard-Penn women’s soccer matchup was slated for overtime. But Quaker defender Kaitlyn Moore had other thoughts in mind as she knocked in a corner kick from Brianna Rano with four seconds left on the clock, giving her team the 1-0 victory Friday night at Rhodes Field.
It was the Crimson’s first road loss of the season.
“I think we played well as a whole,” sophomore goalkeeper Bethany Kantan said. “It was important for us to play as a team, and we played well and fought together the whole game. This was our best team performance this year.”
The match kicked off with Penn creating the first chance of the game less than 45 seconds in, as Kanten was tested by a shot from Penn’s senior forward Alex Dayneka. Six minutes later, Harvard (3-3-1, 0-1 Ivy) also registered its first attempt on goal from freshman forward Lauren Varela. Though Kanten saved Penn’s early shot, and Varela’s attempt sailed wide, these two early salvos foreshadowed the back-and-forth matchup between the Ivy League’s first- and second-place finishers in 2011.
Though held scoreless in the first half, the Crimson managed five shots in the opening frame, two of which came from junior co-captain Peyton Johnson. Not to be outdone, the Quakers (4-4, 1-0) matched the Crimson shot total, leading to the first of five saves for Kanten.
The second half opened with an attempt from Penn forward Kerry Scalora. Though the attempt went high, it set the stage for the next 45 minutes of play in which the Quakers dominated the ball, doubling Harvard’s shot attempts, 6-3.
“There was a lot of play mainly in the middle of the field, but not too many shots because Penn has such a strong defense,” Johnson said. “That definitely made it difficult for both teams to score. Penn has a strong offense and defense, so we had to play a lot of one-on-one matchups.”
Play continued in this fashion until the clock reached 89:52. At that point, a left-side corner kick from Brianna Rano sailed towards the box and was met by Moore, who proceeded to head the ball into the back of the net for her first goal of the season. The score, which came with 3.9 seconds left on the clock, left the Crimson staring at its first Ivy League defeat since October 2010.
“We played well in many ways, but we still have lots to be improved on,” Johnson said. “We definitely came to play, [and] we definitely competed and are proud of our effort. Unfortunately, things just did not go our way in those last few seconds.”
Johnson said that the team will treat this loss as a learning experience, taking from it things to be utilised in the rest of Ivy play.
“There are so many positives to take from this game,” Johnson said. “We were solid defensively, and we competed for the full 90 minutes of the game. At the end of the day, that is most important. Moving forward, we will take more scoring opportunities in future games, and we will be more mindful in the last few minutes of the game.”
Junior forward Elizabeth Weisman echoed her teammate’s sentiments, stressing the importance of taking advantage of every opportunity moving forward.
“We’ve reached a point where we need to reassess and make sure that we are always coming out with 100 percent effort,” Weisman said. “We took it for granted that we kept winning these past years. During the game, we did lots, but we could’ve pushed ourselves a little more. We will use this as motivation for upcoming games. ”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the first installment of a new weekly series, we break down the ins and out of the Harvard football team. First up: the option, a play which has led to a number of scores so far this season for the Crimson.
 
Our  last two Athletes of the Week have been senior running back Treavor  Scales and the offensive line that blocks for him—a testament to the strength of the Crimson’s running attack in the team's first two  contests.
 
While  much of that success can be attributed to the size and skill of  senior quarterback Colton Chapple, Scales, and the offensive linemen, some must go to the Harvard  coaching staff for employing a potent run-option attack. The play  requires impressive timing and football acumen, but as evidenced in  these few plays from the Crimson’s win over San Diego on Sept. 15 at Harvard Stadium, the Crimson  offense has made it look easy.
