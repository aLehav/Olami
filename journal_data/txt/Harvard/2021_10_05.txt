“Lalisa,” the highly anticipated first single from Blackpink’s lead rapper Lisa, aimed high but missed the mark. Her fellow group members Jennie and Rosé recently made their solo debuts, and Lisa — whose full name is Lalisa Manobal — followed suit on Sept. 12 with “Lalisa.”
“Lalisa,” a classic EDM song interwoven with rap, attempts to appeal to an American audience through the inclusion of full English verses and choruses, whose clumsy alliteration often undermines Lisa’s impressive rapping. For example, the song fits 24 repetitions of the phrase “Lalisa, love me,” in just three minutes and 20 seconds.
The intro to her song begins with a chromatic sequence that is then repeated without much musical direction. This overly literal repetition persists throughout her song; for example, when she sings “ring the alarms,” actual alarms begin to blare. Furthermore, as her song continues, a rap breakout eventually begins in which she raps in triplets, imitating the three syllables of her full name; however, this choice lacks further significance.
This song, while superficial in some respects, does pay homage to Lisa’s Thai heritage. Rapping “from Thailand to Korea” in Korean, Lisa conveys a sense of universality across cultures and reaches many of her fans across the world.
While “Lalisa” may seem to lack inner depth from the listener’s standpoint, her formidable rapping skills shine through. However, the music video’s reliance on visual elements doesn’t quite compensate for the absence of a cohesive lyrical narrative.

Last month, The Boston Ballet School (BBS) announced that Margaret Tracey will be stepping down as school’s director after 14 years in the role. Throughout her tenure as director, Tracey had an outsize influence on building the school into the powerhouse it is today. Not only did she develop the BBS’ identity and mission, she was also committed to serving the school’s broad-based student body and increasing accessibility to ballet for underrepresented communities.
Like most professional ballet dancers, Tracey got her start in ballet at a young age. She grew up watching her mother go to ballet class, and at six years old, Tracey joined her.
“I was a very shy little girl and the minute I stepped into the ballet studio and nobody asked me to talk for an hour, I was in heaven. I felt that I had found my voice,” said Tracey in a phone conversation with The Harvard Crimson on Sept. 28. “Ballet gave me the confidence to find out who I was as a human, who I am as a woman.”
Tracey joined the New York City Ballet (NYCB) in 1986 and was named principal dancer five years later. At NYCB, she worked with eminent American choreographer Jerome Robbins, and even had several roles created expressly for her. She retired from NYCB in 2002, was invited to be a guest teacher at BBS in 2005, and began her time as BBS’s director in 2007.
While much of ballet choreography celebrates women, ballet leadership is a predominantly male space. Ballet’s history goes back centuries and its established gender norms haven't been quick to change.
“What I have found is that if we question and challenge those male counterparts within our sphere, we can be considered difficult or defensive,” Tracey said. The attitude towards female leadership that Tracey describes is representative of broader societal gender norms. Looking back, Tracey said she was, for many years, naive about being one of the few female leaders in the space.
“I just assumed the work always speaks for itself, and if I’m fighting for values that I believe in, that that would be respected and revered and I’ve unfortunately learned that we still in our society have a ways to go in being able to honor that strength in female leaders.” Her experiences in ballet leadership motivate her to assure her female students that their voices matter.
Tracey spoke to her goals at BBS, which have been to create a curriculum that supports the school’s student body, elevates the reputation of the professional division, and focuses on diversity and inclusion. Her first few years were spent “shoring up the structure of the school” in order to strengthen the school’s identity. Tracey emphasized BBS’s commitment to training the next generation of professional dancers for companies across the globe as well as nurturing a love of dance in anyone who was interested.
Thinking about what it really means to be an inclusive school was a priority for Tracey.
“We have a very diverse Boston, and yet our student body doesn’t reflect the diversity of our community that we claim we’re serving,” she said. These goals remain the beacons of Tracey’s work, which serves a larger purpose of adjusting ballet’s traditions. Much of ballet has historically been Eurocentric and elitist, having originated in Italian royal courts. Stories of princesses and wealth have been the default, so having conversations about including diverse perspectives is crucial for the art form’s evolution.
“A lot of the work being done in our industry is to analyze the classical canon,” she said. “Do we retell these stories? Do we eliminate these stories?”
Along with the stories told by ballet, barriers to entry for underrepresented communities also contribute to a lack of inclusivity. Tracey pointed to simple things like the dress code that can strongly affect people’s experience and comfort in ballet.
“Historically, we have pink tights because they closely match the skintone of white Europeans who mostly did ballet at the time it became a tradition.” Outdated traditions like these can be incredibly exclusionary to entire groups of people, and paying attention to these types of issues is crucial moving forward.
One of Tracey’s favorite projects that she initiated at BBS has been the annual Next Generation Program for the professional division students. Every year they collaborate with a local youth orchestra and spotlight female and BIPOC choreographers.
“This is where I try to make an impact in who’s on that stage, and it's their ballet graduation.” The last performance was in 2019 and Tracey hopes that it will remain an annual event.
“There’s nothing more exciting than seeing this raw energy of young talent on the cusp of their professional journeys,” she said.
When asked about what she’ll miss, Tracey was quick to say the people. She admires her coworkers, dancers, and students, not only as people but as artists. “I have some lifelong friends because of this job and I’m incredibly grateful,” she said.
Looking ahead, Tracey doesn’t plan to stop teaching. She feels called to ballet and has committed her whole career to the industry. Tracey’s short term plans include freelance work, guest teaching, consulting, and sharing what she’s learned as a leader through working with other organizations. This work will focus on changing curriculums and faculty development. Most faculty hired at ballet schools are professional dancers and typically haven’t had formal educational training, so Tracey is incredibly proud of the professional development portfolio at BBS she’s established, which promotes the faculty thinking of themselves as educators first who specialize in ballet. She also hopes to take time to be with her family.
“I look forward to the doors that I will have the time to open,” Tracey said. There is no doubt that whatever comes next for Margaret Tracey, she will be continuing to educate and guide the future of ballet.

“July,” the fourth collection of poetry by Albany native Kathleen Ossip, examines 21st-century America through the lens of a road trip from Minnesota to Florida. While the American road narrative has famously been explored by artists ranging from Jack Kerouac to Paul Simon, Ossip’s reflections on religion, womanhood, and aging in the United States lend originality and exceptional nuance to this artistic trope. Although she writes with a keen understanding of American political tensions, Ossip’s expression of these falters in the third section of “July,” weakening an otherwise potent display of social consciousness and lyrical talent. Regardless of its few cliché moments, Ossip’s “July” represents a candid and fearless portrait of the author’s voyage into the very heart of her nation.
Split into three sections, “July” is at its most powerful when vividly describing the mundane elements of American life. “On Boredom,” the collection’s third poem, is truly outstanding in this manner. By juxtaposing crucial elements of American iconography — such as the Broadway musical — with memories of her beloved aunt, Ossip foregrounds her later critiques of the nation in a deep appreciation of her cultural heritage. Indeed, throughout “July,” Ossip puts her readers’ experiences in conversation with her own by drawing upon a wide array of cultural touchstones like “Citizen Kane,” McDonald’s, and Georgia O’Keeffe. In her poem “July 4” (another standout), Ossip underscores the havoc that America’s independence has wreaked upon its global neighbors through a short line about a dog’s fear of fireworks. These subtleties, found in each section of the collection, demonstrate an astounding intentionality within the author’s choice of imagery.
Additionally, Ossip’s expert use of motherhood as a lens through which to view America is refreshing and deeply affecting. She admirably and honestly recounts her feelings of jealousy, protection, and fear for her daughter, Muriel, in a way reminiscent of Joan Didion’s reflections in her seminal prose work, “The Year of Magical Thinking.” In a particularly haunting line from the poem “July 13,” Ossip learns that Muriel does not know the difference between a pony and a colt and asks herself what else she hasn’t taught her daughter. Through this small moment, Ossip skillfully conveys all of the fear inherent to raising a girl in an environment as hostile to women as much of America seems — a sentiment especially resonant following the newly restrictive abortion laws in Texas.
It is when Ossip strays from her moving descriptions of the ordinary into grand statements regarding the failures of the American experiment that her distinct voice begins to deteriorate. In “July 11,” for instance, Ossip writes, “It’s easy to love a country if you avoid its people.” While this line may have seemed profound in isolation, when placed next to such exceptional poetry about motherhood and cultural values, it falls flat, reading as trite and unprobing. Disappointing lines such as this one crop up with growing frequency in the third section of “July,” entitled “The Goddess,” with banal remarks concerning global warming and power strewn throughout. Nonetheless, this section also includes some of the most experimental and thoughtful poetry in the entire collection as Ossip explores the role of women as objects for sex and birth in certain subsets of American culture.
An in-depth analysis of the factors that make the vast United States beautiful, complex, and terrifying, Kathleen Ossip’s “July” largely succeeds in its depiction of one woman’s increasingly personal encounters with her country. Beyond her skilled illustration of motherhood, Ossip’s contemplation of consumerism and religion is poignant throughout the collection and represents an original spin on the traditional narrative associated with the American road trip. Despite a handful of contrived moments, “July” is well-worth reading as we try to find a cohesive identity as Americans in rapidly changing and intensely polarized times.

B.J. Novak is back. The writer, producer, and actor known for his roles in “The Office” and “Inglourious Basterds” made his return to the screen on Sept. 16 with the two-episode Hulu premiere of his newest creation, “The Premise.” Billed as “An Anthology of Now,” Novak’s new show sees him team up with big name actors in an effort to create a series of self-contained episodes, each focused on a different contemporary issue. And boy has he hit the mark: episodes one and two did not disappoint.
Episode one, “Social Justice Sex Tape,” is just about as ridiculous as its title. It tells the story of Ethan Streiber (Ben Platt), a woke, white twenty-something whose identity as an ally to social justice movements is tested by his willingness to show a humiliating sex tape in court that happened to catch the key moments of the arrest of an innocent black man. The scrupulous dissection of the sex tape in court to verify its authenticity is downright hilarious, but the true brilliance in the story is what is hidden underneath the humor.
Novak opens this episode with an on-screen appearance in which he asks the question, “What is comedy?” And though he immediately plays this question off as a joke, it cannot be ignored as a driving force behind this episode. Here, comedy functions on multiple levels as a tool to draw attention to a more serious issue. In the story, the young lawyer Eve Stone (Ayo Edebiri) admits to her mentor Rayna Bradshaw (Tracee Ellis Ross) that she leaks Ethan’s sex tape because she know it will draw attention to the innocent Darren Williams (Jermaine Fowler), who faces 15 years in prison for a crime he didn’t commit. The same is true of the episode itself: Novak’s humor draws in viewers and keeps them engaged, thus giving him a captive audience to ask, “How far would you go to support the movements you say you believe in?”
Episode two, “Moment of Silence,” is a complete change of pace: As its title well suggests, it is a serious and contemplative piece. Jon Bernthal stars as Chase Milbrandt, who decides to pursue a career as a PR representative for the National Gun Lobby a year after his five-year-old daughter was killed in a mass shooting. Bernthal does an excellent job portraying the hard-to-read Chase, whose motives remain difficult to place until the show’s shocking climax and conclusion.
Novak’s writing here is no less effective at presenting the gun-rights debate to his audience than it was at examining the role of social justice allies in episode one. Chase’s first conversation with his new boss, in which he shows his versatility as a PR representative by making the case for and against gun control, frames the show in light of this debate. Likewise, his new friend Aron (Boyd Holbrook) presents the perspective of someone who inherited his love for guns and hunting from his family. The show’s climax, however, is the true kicker: A bloodbath in the workplace exposes the irony inherent in the defense of gun rights. Better yet, the shocking note on which the show ends leaves the viewer reeling and, ultimately, unavoidably introspective.
In its two-episode premiere, “The Premise” proved itself to be a promising series that is timely, engaging, and thought-provoking. Episodes one and two gave us a taste of the variety that we can come to expect throughout the rest of this “Anthology of Now,” which will see a new episode released for streaming every Thursday.
B.J. Novak is back, and TV this fall just got a whole lot more interesting.

“You think you can attach one word to something in order to understand it? To make you feel safe?”
These words come halfway through Fran Kranz’s directorial debut, “Mass,” a quietly devastating, superbly acted film that details the meeting between the parents of a school shooting victim and the parents of the shooter. This line, spoken by the father of the shooter, strikes at the heart of the film, which emphasizes that there are no easy answers to be found in the aftermath of such a tragedy — and hindsight doesn’t always make things clearer.
Kranz is best known for his acting, playing roles such as Marty in “The Cabin in the Woods” and Claudio in “Much Ado About Nothing.” He both wrote and directed “Mass,” which premiered at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival this past January. It’s a film that veteran writer-directors would be proud to have on their resume, and announces Kranz as a deftly talented filmmaker with an exciting future.
The film opens on a wide shot of a grand church. Judy (Breeda Wool), who works at the church, pulls up and enters. From there, we’re quickly introduced to Anthony (Kagen Albright), a teenage volunteer, and Kendra (Michelle N. Carter), who works with two of the parents. They don’t do anything particularly exciting – they set up a table and discuss logistics – but the audience is hooked by Kranz’s directorial decisions. Kranz foregoes music and fancy camerawork, instead using long, static shots and solely diegetic sound, which he maintains for most of the film. He lets this eerie stillness and the fantastic dialogue drive the tension, relying as much on the information he leaves out as what he includes. We are never told outright what is happening, but the tightness in the characters’ bodies and the delicate verbal dance they perform grabs our attention and keeps us on uneven footing.
The audience is then introduced to the parents of the victim, Jay and Gail Perry, played to perfection by Jason Isaacs (“Harry Potter”) and Martha Plimpton (“The Goonies”). They are on-edge, weather-beaten, careworn, and unsure. Soon the parents of the shooter, Linda and Richard, brought to life by masterful performances from Ann Dowd (“Hereditary”) and Reed Birney (“House of Cards”), arrive. Nearly 20 minutes after the film has started, the parents are finally left alone, wrestling with Kendra’s parting words: “I’m hopeful that we all think that this was a good thing to do by the time we leave here today.”
The conversation that follows is often difficult to get through, both for the characters on screen and the audience. It’s soon revealed that the shooting happened six years ago, and the parents have been dealing with its aftermath ever since. To say more would rob future viewers of the impact of their exchange. This is a huge credit to Kranz’s screenplay, which traverses tricky terrain with skill and empathy, never glossing over the most devastating aspects of the shooting, nor using it for spectacle or shock value. The characters fumble with their words, they backtrack and stutter, and they jump through stories and interrupt each other — mimicking the halting and dissonant nature of real speech and adding another layer of realism to already tangible performances.
Kranz’s directing is simple, with the camera lingering on a medium two- or four-shot of the characters, maintaining an uncomfortable, inescapable intimacy between the audience, the characters, and the events they’re dissecting. When the camera eventually transitions to handheld, the subtle sway heightens the tension of the scenes. The one unfortunate decision Kranz makes is during the most emotional scene of the film, when the camera suddenly cuts out of the room to an earlier shot of the countryside. For a film so invested in immersion, it’s an abrupt and startling decision that dulls the impact of the scene.
The film’s performances are outstanding. Each of the four actors gives an understated and heart-rending performance that never wavers. Jason Isaacs, in particular, stands out for his depiction of a father ravaged by grief. Whether or not the audience completely agrees with what the characters say, the actors embody their characters so well that it’s impossible not to see the validity of their emotions.
At about the hour and a half mark, it seems that the movie has reached its clean-cut, cathartic conclusion — and then it continues for another twenty minutes as the characters leave the church. It’s a risky but admirable choice by Kranz that ultimately elevates the film. With such events, there is no “clean” solution, no moment of emotional catharsis that heals past trauma. What’s lost is lost. And in the end, audiences may find themselves empathizing with the family of the shooter nearly as much as with the family of the victim. In one of the film’s most powerful monologues, Linda tearfully exclaims, “And the truth is, we believed we were good parents. And in some awful, confusing way, we still do.”
“Mass” isn’t a story of sides. It’s a story of confusion, trauma, and uncertainty. It shows how the heinous actions of one person don’t have to define the people they were close to. It shows how the past can define the present, and how to move forward in spite of that.

Released on Sept. 10, Ari Lennox’s new single “Pressure” is an addictive jam that feels as warm and safe as it does lively. A neo-soul twist on the homey solace provided by her debut album “Shea Butter Baby,” “Pressure” was produced by the acclaimed Jermaine Dupri, along with Bryan-Michael Cox and Johnta Austin, an all-star group that certainly did justice to Lennox’s dulcet tones. As the first female artist signed to J. Cole’s Dreamville Records, this R&B singer-songwriter from Washington D.C. is known for her heartfelt deliverance of lyrics about love and femininity. On this latest release, Lennox encapsulates these themes, using her soulful vocals and relatable lyrics to provide listeners with an intimacy that feels familiar. In this ode to foreplay, the fast-rising star teases us with hints to a new sound that leaves endless possibilities for her upcoming bops.
Like Lennox’s 2020 single, “Chocolate Pomegranate,” “Pressure” is an unabashed expression of sexual pleasure. The song is as fearless and sincere as some of the strongest tracks from her debut album, namely “New Apartment,” “I Been,” and “Whipped Cream.” What makes “Pressure” stick out, however, is its versatility. The single pairs elegant, classic blues instrumentation with a catchy and upbeat pop beat, allowing listeners to enjoy it in whatever capacity they choose. It is stimulating enough to listen to mindlessly, but has the timeless groove and backup vocals that popularized soul music in the 60s and 70s. As implied in Lennox’s music video for the single, it is an homage to the captivating female soul singers who greatly influenced the genre during that time. The single even samples the iconic Shirley Brown’s “Blessed is the Woman (With a Man Like Mine),” a beloved soul record, throughout the song. This old soul influence is especially present in the joy her record evokes from listeners.
“Pressure” also gifts us with assertive lyrics — “Why you ain't fuck with me when I wasn't this fly (Fly) / Now I'm on top and now I'm ridin' sky-high (Pressure)” — that cleverly utilize two definitions of pressure: the slang term that describes someone cool, and the word’s literal meaning in a sexual context. This track, like much of Lennox’s work, voices under-acknowledged truths about womanhood. With lines like “Don't need nobody but I'll take you down tonight /And I'm okay with bein' nasty (Pressure),” the singer confidently expresses her sexuality, inspiring listeners to do the same. Fans can rest assured that though Lennox is working with a new sound, her honest lyrics remain.

After five films as 007, Daniel Craig is hanging up his suit and his license to kill. It’s taken a litany of rewrites and a release delayed almost two years by a global pandemic, but “No Time to Die” has finally found its way to theaters. And somehow, despite a bloated script held together by nothing more than a single flimsy strand of scotch tape, director Cary Joji Fukunaga (“Beasts of No Nation”) delivers one of the best Bond conclusions. Craig’s swan song farewell is packed with strong character work, adrenaline-fueled action scenes, and a surprisingly effective emotional sendoff.
“No Time to Die” starts with Bond in unofficial retirement from MI6, enjoying the Italian coast with Dr. Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux, “Spectre”). But paradise doesn’t last forever, and Bond is eventually roped back into espionage by his old friend Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright, “Casino Royale” and “Quantum of Solace”). He tasks Bond to investigate a kidnapped MI6 scientist developing a bioweapon. What follows is a labyrinthian trail of clues, peppered with extravagant set pieces and new characters like 00 agent Nomi (Lashana Lynch), CIA agent Paloma (Ana de Armas), and a very theatrical villain Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malek).
Clocking in at a whopping 163 minutes, “No Time to Die” is the longest Bond film ever made. Much of that time is spent consolidating Bond’s character arc from previous films — and Fukunaga isn’t afraid to lean into some of the gritty nuances of Bond’s past. For instance, “No Time to Die” starts with a callback to Vesper’s death (Eva Green) in “Casino Royale” — a poignant reminder of how difficult it is for Bond to trust and to love. Betrayal and disenfranchisement, like being left for dead by MI6 in “Skyfall,” have been pivotal moments for the character, and that’s especially visible in scenes where Craig plays Bond as callous and cynical. All of these character choices are carefully selected to guide the audience to a very cathartic and shockingly tender payoff by the film’s conclusion.
“No Time to Die” succeeds when it focuses on Bond’s personal growth, but it juggles too many characters to make a perfectly cohesive story. For instance, the film tries to wrap up the rivalry introduced in “Spectre” between Bond and Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Christoph Waltz), but their confrontation ends up being little more than a glorified cameo scene. In fact, the whole Spectre subplot in “No Time to Die” could be removed with little consequence to the story. The main antagonist, Safin, doesn’t have much to do either. Save for a brief appearance in the opening scene, he is completely absent for the first 90 minutes. When he does show up, his motivations are unclear and some of his actions simply don’t make sense.
Fortunately, having weak villains doesn’t hinder the film’s action scenes, which are thoroughly entertaining and unlike anything we’ve seen in the Craig era. It’s important to remember that Craig’s James Bond reboot was born to separate the cinematic icon from previous, more whimsical portrayals — to reinvent Bond for the modern era, so to speak. In short, out went the funny gadgets, and in came the self-serious commentary on why we still need spies in the 21st century. With Academy Award-winning director Sam Mendes (“American Beauty” and “1917”) at the helm for “Skyfall,” that approach worked. In a world where spy films like “Mission: Impossible” blew up the box office by having Tom Cruise climb the Burj Khalifa, the 007 franchise was calculated and methodical. “No Time To Die” takes that grounded approach and throws it out of the window. But for the most part, it’s successful.
In “Skyfall,” Bond quipped about his lack of equipment: “A gun and a radio. Not exactly Christmas, is it?” Well it’s Christmas now, Mr. Bond. Fukunaga throws everything but the kitchen sink on screen including a magnet bomb, an EMP watch, an Aston Martin DB5 with machine gun headlights, and a spy plane that ejects from a C-17. And while it means that there are times when “No Time to Die” feels more like a British “Mission: Impossible” than a follow-up to “Casino Royale,” it’s undeniable that the gadgets bring a lot of no-frills-popcorn-fun.
It doesn't quite reach the technical heights of Mendes’s Bond films (Roger Deakins produced Oscar-nominated cinematography in “Skyfall”), or the storytelling freshness of “Casino Royale,” but “No Time to Die” finds its own worthy place in the Bond canon. Given some of Craig’s comments voicing a lack of enthusiasm after “Spectre,” fans should rejoice that the actor is going out on his own terms. And with a hard-hitting conclusion, entertaining action, and some memorable character moments, Craig certainly ends his time as 007 with a bang.

After almost two years in a pandemic-induced coma, the American Repertory Theater sprang back to life on Sept. 29 with the live premiere of “Ayodele Casel: Chasing Magic,’’ which runs until Oct. 9. Choosing Ayodele Casel’s tap dance production as opposed to a play might seem like an odd decision for the A.R.T.’s grand reopening, but an inspiring celebration of life in the form of vignettes with themes ranging from gratitude and friendship to heritage is exactly what an audience finally attending live performances again needs to lift its spirits.
One of the greatest strengths of “Chasing Magic’’ is the sheer artistry of Casel’s movement, which fully taps into tap dance’s expressive and athletic potential and stretches the boundaries of the form. Her moves seem nothing short of superhuman. The physically demanding taps, leaps and changes of pace somehow appear effortless. The movements’ easy flow and rapid beat make for an extraordinary visual and aural performance on their own. The vaudeville-esque dance elements are tasteful and used in moderation, enhancing the experience without proving overbearing or distracting.
The carefully rehearsed, fluid choreography doesn’t always conform to the rhythm of the music. There is something surprising about Casel’s moves, something that keeps the audience on its toes and provokes a sense of uncertainty. Out of nowhere, an out-of-place tap emerges, a tap that goes against the beat of the music. But the uneasy head-scratching quickly gives way to relief and joy, the overarching sensations of this performance, as the next taps reveal an intricate pattern working not against but in sync with the music.
While Casel’s passionate moves are bound to steal the show, the light of other stars still shines brightly through. The music of “Chasing Magic” might be playing second fiddle to the dance, but it is hard to imagine the performance without it. The piano, an instrument that could easily be relegated to nothing more than background for tap dance, is turned into a veritable marvel in the skilled hands of the two pianists, Anibal Cezar Cruz and the Grammy-award winning Arturo O’Farrill. The latter’s unassuming entry into the performance quickly shakes things up. As he sits down behind the instrument, tap dance gives way to a dialogue that explores his relationship with Casel. His performance follows shortly thereafter, and the music guides Casel’s steps, as for the only time in “Chasing Magic,” she improvises her moves, making a powerful statement forming the centerpiece of the show’s section on trust.
While “Chasing Magic” does share joy, the music and the dance are more than a feast for the senses. The musical vignettes intertwine pieces of commentary on the issues faced by America’s underprivileged communities, from an education system that disregards their experiences and societal expectations that they will fail, to an art scene still prejudiced against performers of color. The two vocalists, Crystal Monee Hall and Keisel Jimenéz, are an indispensable part of that project, deftly emphasizing Casel’s heritage as an Afro-Latina, the Black and Indingeous roots and traditions that her community was deprived of as a result of enslavement and past discriminations. Hall graces the theater with finesse reminiscent of Gloria Gaynor: The longing tone of her deep voice and the soul style of her singing allow her to present a lyrical message of hope, Black fortitude, and a resonating statement on ongoing injustices.
Jiménez uses Afro-Cuban inspirations and a timbal, congas, and drum set to transport the audience to the Caribbean with soul-touching music that encapsulated the longing for the continent his ancestors were forcibly separated from.
The show would succeed in making even completely unfamiliar viewers gain an appreciation of tap dance even if it merely offered expert movement, great music, and evocative artistry. But it accomplishes much more. “My mission is always the same, and that is for people to feel the love that I have,” Casel says in the show’s press release. “I want to invite people to feel what I feel, and to appreciate it and to recognize it in themselves. If you see joy in me, it’s because you have that in your life or you want that in your life. That’s the magic that I’m chasing, that I think we’re all chasing. We have it in us, and it’s worthy of pursuit.” By that definition, “Chasing Magic” — a deeply personal ode to positivity, trust and cultural pride — is magical indeed.

“Ted Lasso,” which premiered in Aug. 2020, garnered 20 Emmy nominations after its first season on Apple TV+ and won seven, including Outstanding Comedy Series. The innocent, charismatic American soccer coach played by Jason Sudeikis won the hearts of millions of viewers as he stumbled through England and coached a team in the English Premier League, AFC Richmond, armed with only his whistle and his motto: “Believe.” Featuring loveable characters such as bad boy football star Jamie Tartt (Phil Dunster), internet influencer Keeley Jones (Juno Temple), and kit-man Nathan Shelley (Nick Mohammed), the show had all the keys to a fun situational comedy, with strong recurring jokes and opportunities to laugh at good-old Ted Lasso and his antics.
However, the writers took the show in a different direction in Season Two.
With the introduction of sports psychologist Dr. Sharon Fieldstone (Sarah Niles) in the season premiere, the focus of the plot turned from a silly American abroad to the complexities of mental health and the desire to belong in today’s fragmented world. Originally brought in to help player Danny Rojas (Cristo Fernández) recover from the trauma of accidentally killing a dog with a penalty kick, Dr. Sharon has played an increasingly large role in each episode. Following his traumatic divorce, Lasso’s distrust of therapists forces a tension with Dr. Sharon and the players who benefit from her assistance. These tensions build to a climax in the eighth episode in which Dr. Sharon’s bike crash and a physical altercation between Jamie Tartt and his abusive father prompt Lasso to reveal a traumatic childhood event.
Although his crumbling marriage and isolation in London developed Lasso’s character in the first season, this climax reveals a new Ted, one who is completely unrecognizable from the goofy Kansan in the first season. While the old Ted is compelling for the sake of a comedy series, the new Ted brings a beautifully human truth to the table: Pain can lurk within seemingly endless joy. Many times, one finds the wish to bring joy to others precisely from within this pain.
Additionally, Dr. Sharon’s development as a psychiatrist facing her own mental struggles creates a level of nuance not often found in therapist roles on television. She is neither the all-knowing doctor nor a character introduced solely to guide Ted in the right direction, but her symbiotic relationship with the ever-developing Ted shows that coaches and psychiatrists face the same problems as everyone else.
And what better place to tackle the complex theme of mental health struggles than a transatlantic comedy series about soccer? Seriously — it works.
Film and television often tackle mental health in a variety of ways, from teenage drug abuse in “Euphoria” to sardonic nihilism in “BoJack Horseman,” but rarely do we see athletes at the forefront of our discussions of mental health. Do athletes not struggle in silence like the rest of us? Representation in all sectors of our world is pivotal in creating a society in which people are not afraid to discuss the issues they are facing. If anything, sports is an area where mental health should be prioritized. Competitive attitudes, rigorous training, and overarching perceptions of masculinity can place unnecessary burdens on athletes, ones which they are not comfortable to share with teammates or coaches. Recently, American superstar and Chelsea midfielder Christian Pulisic opened up about his mental health and revealed he has been seeing a psychiatrist in London to deal with the isolation of living alone in a foreign country. “I felt like if I were to talk about the way I felt that I was weak or something like that,” he said to CBS Sports.
“Ted Lasso” is tackling this stigma in its sophomore season, all the while analyzing the complexities of family, friendships, and coaching soccer in a new country. One biscuit at a time, Ted continues to spread his revolution of kindness and show that, indeed, “football is life.”
New episodes of “Tes Lasso” are released on Fridays on Apple TV+.

Ever since she toured her first EP “Don’t Smile at Me” at age 16, Billie Eilish has been an electric performer. At this year’s Governors Ball Music Festival, she brought that energy back with a vengeance. With the festival marking one of her first in-person shows in over a year, and after releasing a highly successful sophomore album, Eilish performed like she had something to prove. It would be an understatement to simply say that she did not disappoint; she was a firecracker from beginning to end.
With intricate songs demanding a multi-octave range, it was a wonder that Eilish was pitch-perfect throughout. But then again, she’s never given fans a reason to doubt her vocals. Eilish paired nearly every song with tireless jumping and running up, down, and around her specially designed stage, making sure to give attention to fans in every corner of the venue. Throughout, she never failed to make her light, gauzy voice soar over her brother and collaborator Finneas and her band’s thumping instrumentation.
The L.A. native and 10-time Grammy winner also made sure to bring her audience in on the performance with her. “Give me all that energy you’ve been saving up for the past year and a half, okay?” she said before breaking into “my strange addiction.” When she went into her new track “Oxytocin,” a song she said she and Finneas wrote “specifically for what’s about to happen,” she spent the lead up to the beat drop begging people to get as low as they could (“No cheating! Lower, lower, lower, lower, LOW-er!”) before exploding with her into jumping and dancing for the rest of the track.
Tracks like “NDA” on one end of the spectrum and “Halley’s Comet” and “when the party’s over” on the other came with built-in opportunities for Eilish to inspire her fans to scream at the top of their lungs or be captivated by her subtle vocal acrobatics, respectively — a testament to her ability to move a crowd with her. Indeed, the set was a dynamic one, and Eilish did it all. Ever the superstar, she grabbed the attention of the thousands of people in the audience and held him captivated for the hour-plus set. She wanted to see everyone dancing: “Not just the front, not just the middle, but everybody I can see,” she said. “I can see you in the back! You might think I can’t but I can and I want you to jump.”
Kicking the show off with the darkly captivating “bury a friend,” Eilish took her audience through an expansive tour of her music — from early hits like 2017’s “Bored” (featured in the “Thirteen Reasons Why” soundtrack) to tracks from her latest album “Happier than Ever.” Even her earliest songs, “Ocean Eyes” and “Bellyache,” got marquee treatment in a mashup sung from atop a moving crane, an appreciated nod to fans of the two hits that first introduced Eilish to the world. With the magnitude of this show, such a packed set seemed only fitting.
Eilish’s range throughout the night also showcased her incredible growth as a performer in recent years. Seeing her on stage, it was hard to conceive of her doing anything else. The last time Eilish played Gov Ball, she was 16 and coming off the heels of her critically acclaimed and wildly popular debut EP.
“This is the best show ever,” she told a screaming audience, who had finally let her speak after a restless chant of “Billie! Billie! Billie!” “I played Gov Ball in 2018 … and it was my favorite thing in the world…. It was my favorite thing I’d ever done, and this might be that, the second time,” she said. The performance had the air of a homecoming, and a long-overdue one at that. Her performance of “everything i wanted” next to Finneas atop an elevated platform proved an emotional heart of the set, with her collaborator (and the song’s muse) in the spotlight as the faces of the audience were projected onto the platform and the giant screens behind the pair.
“all the good girls go to hell” was another emotional high point. “You guys, we need to take care of our planet. Dead ass,” she said as the intro to the “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?” track started to creep in behind her. “If you don’t think global warming is real, you’re a fucking idiot.” Eilish paired the song with vibrant visuals of raging wildfires and climate protests, a stark image reflecting itself in Eilish’s all-white outfit as she sang of “hills [burning] in California.”
“Give it all to me, right now,” Eilish demanded of the crowd before closing her set with two of her greatest hits — “bad guy” and an unforgettable performance of “Happier Than Ever.” From start to finish, Eilish proved that all the hype surrounding her is well-deserved. Her performance was virtually flawless, all but cementing her standing as an unstoppable force in the music world.

On Saturday, Sept. 18, Boston University’s ​​Department of Musicology and Ethnomusicology and the BU Arts Initiative held their annual Global Music Festival. The event showcased international music and educational events — such as lectures, panel discussions, and workshops — that are free and open to the public. The festival stands out from other global music festivals of its kind thanks to its impressive accessibility.
Those who walked past Boston University Beach on the day of the festival likely heard the magnetic echoes of music playing throughout the day. A variety of artists took to the outdoor stage to play to an audience of Boston University affiliates and Boston community members of all ages. Performers included Combo Chimbita, Eastern Medicine Singers, Gund Kwok, Veronica Robles Mariachi Quartet, Alsarah & the Nubatones, La Pelanga, Riyaaz Qawwali, Zili Misik. The festival featured a balance of both local and international musicians, with the aim of lifting up marginalized voices.
“We always tried to kind of bring in indigenous voices, to try to emphasize women's voices because most music festivals tend to lack those representations,” said Marié Abe, Associate Professor of Ethnomusicology at Boston University, performing musician with the Boston-based Ethiopian groove collective, Debo Band, and artistic director of the festival.
Abe has been a part of Boston University for the past eleven years; he is one of the first ethnomusicologists at the university and is the founder of the Global Music Festival.
“When I came here, all the musical programming was Western art music,” said Abe. She felt that there was a need for more opportunities to experience more diverse music, so she set out to create that space. “So I started once a semester, noontime concerts, small scale, knocked on doors, you know, collecting small funds, so it started really small.”
The music showcased by the festival shares the art and histories of communities across the world and connects the audience to current events as well.
“People get to maybe feel a little bit closer to the places or issues that they hear about, but may not have the human connections. So you know, when I see audience members talking to the artists to kind of learn more about those issues, you know, that's meaningful,” said Abe.
The festival has been organized annually ever since Abe created it in collaboration with producer Ty A. Furman in 2018. Furman is the Managing Director of the BU Arts Initiative and has been producing the concert every year since. He’s particularly proud of the way the festival intentionally welcomes the greater Boston community.
“My favorite thing about the festival is the intergenerational audience. So as you probably saw, all the kids out there dancing, people bring in their families, their children,” said Furman.
Among the Boston University students in attendance was first-year student Shasta Narayanan, who expressed why he thinks events like the Global Music Festival are important.
“Diversity is very important. So I feel like events like these where it really opens up our minds to like different cultures, different aspects of like expression across the world to see...the different, I guess like arts, different music, different cultures of all across the world,” said Narayanan.
The BU Global Music Festival is held each year and is a great resource for the greater Boston community to connect with music from around the world.

When CBS announced “The Activist,” a reality TV show “combining philanthropy and entertainment,” on Sept. 9, a flurry of scornful headlines ensued. “Real Activists Express Disgust At Reality Series 'The Activist’,” reported Newsweek. “CBS’s ‘The Activist’ seems to think doomscrolling equals activism,” decried The Verge.
The premise of the show was problematic, but so was the media’s conclusion that the commercialized activism cannot be worthwhile. The one takeaway from the scandal should be that the pairing of activism and reality TV is a potent, inevitable match, one that — thanks to the conversation started by “The Activist” — can be executed more tastefully in the future.
As reality TV hosts, the trio of Usher, Priyanka Chopra and Julianne Hough seems perfect — that is, for something like “America’s Got Talent.” According to the network’s calculation with “The Activist,” the three would have made the perfect experts on education, health, and the environment, guiding the activists across three main philanthropic fields. As for the participants themselves, the five-week-long show’s format would have had a group of six compete against each other: According to the series’ announcement, “the ​​activists will compete in missions, media stunts, digital campaigns and community events aimed at garnering the attention of the world’s most powerful decision-makers,” and their success will be gauged by the hosts and the amount of social media engagement garnered.
As the Twitter backlash pointed out, any positive impact seemed at best a secondary consideration, with CBS blindly following a tried-and-true reality TV show recipe without thinking about the specific nature of activism or its unique role in society. The “tone-deaf” premise reduced genuine activism to not much more than performance and a background for a social-justice-flavored “America’s Got Talent.”
It’s hard not to focus on the offensiveness of what would have been a shamelessly inconsiderate show profiteering off of people’s goodwill, featuring a contest that doesn’t even guarantee actual support for the project but only, at most, a reality show platform. The show’s claims of actual philanthropic commitments were undercut from the get-go by the “cheat tweet” at the end of the announcement: “@usher hosts and @priyankachopra & @juliannehough co-host 5-week #CBS reality competition series #TheActivist from @GlbCtzn, premiering Friday 10/22 at 8 PM/PT.#GlobalCitizen.” The tweet didn’t bother to mention the series’ purported philanthropic links, intentions, or commitments.
But even though CBS framing the show as a charitable endeavor was disingenuous, it’s worth looking at what the indeed unprecedented series could, in theory, have been. “‘The Activist’ will spread awareness about society’s most urgent issues while also giving every viewer the opportunity to be part of the solution,” the show’s press release said. “The Activists’ ultimate goal is to create impactful movements and advance to the G20 summit … for a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to meet with world leaders in the hopes of securing funding and invaluable awareness for their causes.”
The visceral discomfort some feel toward mixing commerce with altruism is understandable, but perhaps premature in light of its benefits. Exposure matters: There is a reason why plenty of people know who Priyanka Chopra is, but have no idea who their congressional representative is. For better or for worse, the massive platform of reality TV is indeed uniquely suited to promoting advocacy.
There’s nothing undignified about watching “90 Day Fiancé”or “RuPaul’s Drag Race,’’ but it’s not a stretch to think that significant parts of reality TV audiences are not educated on social issues or involved in tackling them. By using a medium typically focused on melodrama, action, and lowbrow humor to introduce elements of social commentary, a show like “The Activist” could expose large segments of the population to societal problems and potential solutions they would otherwise lack awareness of.
Granted, this platform is suboptimal despite its significant reach. Especially when the commitment to actual change appears half-hearted, as was the case with “The Activist,” a reality TV show premise includes tradeoffs that can force participants to focus on entertaining audiences and holding their attention. And yet even the limitations are not without their advantages. Who can say that they don’t have a favorite person on their show of choice? Who’s never been disappointed that “their” guy lost? Considering how attached viewers can get to their favorite contestants, it’s no stretch to think they could get attached to their favorite activists. And it would be hard to divorce participants from the good causes they represent, which in turn could boost support for the activist’s agenda.
Finally, there is the matter of prizes. In a Washington Post op-ed, Michele L. Norris highlights the fact that “The Activist” failed at providing support for the causes its participants were to represent. “The contestants don’t compete for actual funds to do good works but merely for the right to crash an international conference and try to shake down world leaders for cash,” she says. But even if being able to promote a cause during a G20 summit seems like an inadequate reward, no one can deny that a more ordinary, say, financial prize wouldn’t benefit an advocacy group, and future shows could certainly offer those.
Meaning can easily get lost in the quest for publicity and high ratings. There are dangers to depicting activism in reality television, and “The Activist” didn’t avoid those pitfalls. But instead of using the show to decry the idea of “combining philanthropy and entertainment,” we should understand it as a lesson about the possibility of creating shows that can foster a more engaged society.

Lil Nas X has risen.
On Friday, Sept. 17, Lil Nas X released his long-awaited debut album, “Montero”, bringing a conclusion to months of non-stop promotions in anticipation of his record rollout. Along with the release of “Montero” came the music video for “That’s What I Want,” the fourth track on the album.
The video opens on a football game where Lil Nas X descends from the sky onto the field, flying down like an asteroid. Clad in a pink uniform, Lil Nas X is sidelined during the game but gazes longingly at a teammate — #79, portrayed by Yai Ariza, his former boyfriend. After Lil Nas X is hauled off to the locker room, Ariza follows him and things quickly heat up between the two. Jerseys, shoulder pads, and gloves are strewn about on the floor and things begin to get steamy — literally and figuratively — in the locker room showers.
The music video then cuts to a scene of Lil Nas X and Ariza dressed as cowboys sitting by a fire — an homage to the 2005 film “Brokeback Mountain.” Lil Nas X plays guitar and sings to Ariza, and the two men share an intimate moment inside of their tent.
It’s easy to write off such eroticism as vulgarity, and perhaps if the circumstances were different, it would be. But the image of two BIPOC men showing their unabashed love and desire for each other, in a world that so often shuns them for it, is not gratuitous or obnoxious — it’s refreshing and brave. Lil Nas X is not reinventing the wheel. This isn’t the first ever music video to show a couple being intimate; however, it’s much rarer that music videos depict queer couples in such a manner. Lil Nas X’s candor about who he is further adds to his appeal as someone who is already an incredibly gifted musician.
The video jumps to Lil Nas X arriving at his lover’s house with a bouquet of roses in hand, only to find that he is married to a woman and has a child — another allusion to “Brokeback Mountain”. Lil Nas X drives off in tears, and returns home to drown his sorrows in bottles of liquor. The scene is sad, and one can’t help but feel for him in his heartache. It’s representative of the heartbreak so many of us will face, but also speaks specifically to queer people. While seeing the one you love with someone else is an all-too-common experience, seeing the one you love with another person in the efforts to hide their identity and love for you is an experience unique to queer people — one that Lil Nas X portrays beautifully in this video.
The final scene shows Lil Nas X envisioning himself in a wedding dress walking alone down the aisle. “I want someone to love me,” he croons. When Lil Nas X arrives at the altar, he is not greeted by his love, but instead by none other than Billy Porter. Porter hands him an electric guitar. Lil Nas X turns to face the now-empty pews in the church and belts out the chorus to “That’s What I Want.” Mascara streams down his face as he screams, “That’s what I fucking want!” and the screen fades to black. The last scene is not only a testament to Lil Nas X’s desire for true love, but also to self-love (after all, he quite literally marries himself). In its totality, the “That’s What I Want” music video is a masterful depiction of queer attraction, desire, and self-love in the face of heartbreak.

“The Royal Tenenbaums” is a quintessential Wes Anderson movie. Made in 2001, the film is quirky and stylized, with a highly saturated and vivid color palette that makes it ever so appealing to the eye. The plot centers around the titular Tenenbaum family, with Gene Hackman portraying the family’s unfaithful, dishonest, and largely-absent patriarch, Royal Tenenbaum. While the film is well done on many levels, with strong visuals and styling, it has one fatal flaw: its mishandling of POC characters.
For background, “The Royal Tenenbaums” tells the story of the three Tenenbaum children, former prodigies for whom greatness has come and gone, and their estranged father Royal’s efforts to win back their mother Etheline (Anjelica Huston) following their long-term separation. The story is told in a very idiosyncratic way, presenting itself as a series of separate chapters, like a novel. Moreover, while watching the film, it’s difficult to tell when exactly it takes place — characters dress in clothing from a wide array of different time periods, from old Western clothing to Adidas tracksuits. Artistic choices such as these are unconventional and visually enticing, and that may be the film’s greatest strength.
In spite of the film’s compelling cinematography, the plot leaves much to be desired. This isn’t to say that the storyline is poorly written or overly simplistic; on the contrary, the film stands as a humorous and intriguing portrait of life in a dysfunctional family. Anderson’s characters, much like the style of the film, are eccentric and fascinating to watch on screen. But the truth is that this film was made about two decades ago, written by two white men and featuring a predominantly white cast, and that fact unfortunately shines through. Henry Sherman (Danny Glover), the only Black character central to the film, is frequently dismissed and looked down on by other characters, particularly Royal. In the movie, Sherman is Etheline’s long-time business manager and friend, and his proposal to her is the catalyst for Royal’s schemes to win back her affection. In fact, the first words spoken to Royal regarding the news are “The black man asks her to be his wife,” by his servant Pagoda (Kumar Pallana), an Indian man, and the only other nonwhite character in the film besides Sherman. Royal’s reaction is nothing short of disgust, saying “I don’t like the sound of this one damn bit, Pagoda,” and “I mean, Lord knows I’ve had my share of infidelities. But she’s still my wife. And no goddamn two-bit chartered accountant is going to change that.”
The pure disdain with which Royal treats Sherman becomes even more apparent as the film progresses, at one point referring to him as “Coltrane” and going so far as to taunt him, saying that he cannot do anything about it. This clearly goes beyond just acting out of jealousy. At another point, Royal asks his son, Richie (Luke Wilson), “What do you think of that big old black buck moving in up there?”
This isn’t to suggest that Sherman’s race is a key plot point, or even the subject of much dialogue. But that’s exactly the issue; the audience is expected to treat such racial transgressions as throwaway lines, or the musings of a profoundly flawed old man. At the end of the film, through many trials and tribulations, Royal earns back his place in the family and has a sort of redemption arc. They acknowledge his failures both personally and as a parent but seem to have basically forgiven him. What that says, implicitly, to the audience, is that they should do the same and forgive him for the error of his ways. When a film sends that message, it does a disservice to people of color, and, despite the implicit message “The Royal Tenenbaums” sends, it simply can’t be forgiven.
It’s disappointing, to say the least. “The Royal Tenenbaums,” for what it’s worth, is whimsical, visually stunning, and masterful in its unorthodox way of storytelling. Who knows, perhaps Anderson would have been more thoughtful in the film’s treatment of POC characters had the film been made today. But the truth is that racism in film is still very present today, and “The Royal Tenenbaums” certainly did not play any part in advancing us forward.

Social media is obsessive, time-consuming, and a necessity for many. People of all ages use social media, ranging from eager 13-year-olds excited to finally join the cult of Instagram to 70-year-olds who use Facebook just to stay connected with old friends. These platforms specifically do not extend to children under 13 for legal reasons. Despite this, earlier this year, Facebook announced that they were creating a brand new platform called “Instagram Kids.”
Facebook advocates that this decision is integral for the next generation of tweens, aged 10 to 12. The company asserts that the digital age of technology is fully consuming the world and culture, and thus, young children are required to adapt to the ever-changing times. As a result, “Instagram Kids” supposedly will address current pressing issues in Generation Alpha, such as the desire for children to misrepresent themselves and their age on social media platforms. “Instagram Kids” will create a safe, legal environment in which these tweens can be their authentic selves.
In addition, another feature of “Instagram Kids” that would better society as a whole, the company argues, is the parental supervision tools being developed. Facebook’s hope is that the control parents have over their children on “Instagram Kids,” such as restricting accounts and filtering abusive messages, will teach tweens how to navigate the essential waters of social media early on, preparing them for more independent social media use in the future.
While the broadening of Instagram will increase its two words greatly, lawmakers, parents, consumer rights groups, and child safety groups alike find “Instagram Kids” extremely problematic. These groups believe that instead of being helpful and providing tweens a much-needed glimpse into social media life, this new platform will instead promote cyber bullying, body shaming, and predatory grooming.
Policymakers, such as U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-C.T.), have come out against Facebook’s ambitious goal over concerns that it will make children more vulnerable to mental health issues — study after study has proven that social media use and an increase in depression or anxiety are correlated. There have also been Senate Commerce subcommittee hearings regarding the issues of an Instagram for kids, and attorney generals from 44 different states and territories wrote a letter calling for the end of this app development.
The intense opposition to such a platform was so strong that Facebook actually gave in somewhat to the majority opinion by pausing their work on this tween platform. Adam Mosseri, Head of Instagram, made this announcement on Sept. 27, 2021, simultaneously eliciting celebratory cheers as well as providing evidence that the fight to end “Instagram Kids” has real momentum.
After this announcement, U.S. Senator Edward J. Markey (D-MA), U.S. Representative Kathy Castor (D-FL 14th District), U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and U.S. Representative Lori Trahan (D-MA 3rd District) banded together to release a statement calling for total dissolution of “Instagram for Kids.” “Time and time again, Facebook has demonstrated the failures of self-regulation, and we know that Congress must step in,” the lawmakers said. These lawmakers even introduced the idea of a Kids Internet Design and Safety (KIDS) Act in order to protect the wellbeing of children and future generations of children.
Clearly, the idea that social media should be extended to tweens is unfavorable to everyone except Facebook, and the cons far outweigh any possible pros. Even on Twitter, users who are evidently above the standard age of 13 have created memes to emphasize and expose the ridiculousness of “Instagram for Kids.” Simply having a 10-year-old wait an additional three years to use social media is in no way unreasonable, and it also gives them enough time to mature so that they can make smart decisions while using social media.

Swifties, what era is Taylor Swift even in? No, really?! On Sept. 17, Swift unexpectedly released her re-recording of “Wildest Dreams,” the dreamy synth-pop ultra-hit originally from her 2015 album “1989.” She seemingly dropped it in response to the “slow zoom” trend going around on TikTok, which uses the original version of the song. On her TikTok that includes a snippet of her re-imagined version, the caption reads: “Someone said slow zoom makes you look like the main character I said make it Taylor’s Version pls.” Later that day, she posted again, this time participating in the trend, self-aware of the incredulous surprise of the single’s release.
Indeed, Swift’s recent arrival on TikTok signifies the first time in years she has participated so frequently on social media; early fans will remember the days of her fun, fan-friendly hyperactivity on Instagram and Tumblr. But the single was dropped with no additional information on “1989 (Taylor’s Version).” Indeed, the next re-recorded album slated to be released isn’t “1989” but “Red (Taylor’s Version)” on Nov. 19. So, are fans supposed to expect a surprise drop of the entire “1989” album, possibly even before “Red?” If so, which re-recording era is Swift even in?
Swift has made an illustrious career with her skilled songwriting, energetic performances, engaging persona, and endless creativity. Notably, with each album she has forged new musical and stylistic “eras.” But the trajectory of Swift’s career was near-fatally threatened in June 2019, when entertainment mogul Scooter Braun acquired Big Machine Records (the label with which she released her first six albums), and, therefore, the masters of those albums, too. Soon after that, Braun sold the masters to someone else in a deal estimated to be worth more than $300 million. This shocked the world, and it shocked Swift, too, who went public and said she was not even offered the sale of her masters. This whole debacle put an end to her relationship with Scott Borchetta, the CEO of Big Machine Records, and executive with whom she first signed at 14 years old, too.
But despite all the tumult, Swift didn’t allow the timeline of her work to stop moving forward. Instead, she decided to warp the space-time continuum altogether. Never one to declare defeat, she announced back in 2019 that she would commit herself to re-recording each of those “lost” six albums, in order to fully own all of her music. The first fully re-recorded album was “Fearless (Taylor’s Version),” which came out this past April. On top of the original album’s music, Swift included “from the vault” tracks, which are songs that were written in the “Fearless” era but not released. (Does the woman ever rest? Does her pen ever run out of ink?)
The release of “Fearless (Taylor’s Version),” rather than her self-titled debut album, signified that Swift would not be going in chronological order for the re-recording process. So it wasn’t all too surprising in June when she announced that the next album to be released would be her version of “Red.” Still, there were some pretty confident fan-theories floating around that “1989” would be the next re-release, which are re-entering the general consciousness now that we’ve been gifted “Wildest Dreams”…
Fans have no idea what she’s going to do next. A master of easter eggs and sneaky surprise releases, Swift could very well be planning to drop “1989 (Taylor’s Version)” and soon, at that. What does all of this mean for her development as an artist? Because these sharply-defined, stylistically bombastic eras have been so characteristic of her career for so long, the fact that she is now blending them together feels like a deliberate change. Indeed, it signifies a reshaping of the power dynamic, a reclaiming of her own agency. Ever a savvy businesswoman, Swift seems to know what she’s doing and she’s taking control of her artistry. That’s evident even in her return to “normal” social media through TikTok; her posts just seem light-hearted and happy.
It’s also evident in “Wildest Dreams,” which has maintained its romantic dreaminess, but is now imbued with a new dynamic power, too. Swift’s vocals punch with strengthened maturity; the instrumentals are cleaner and more lush; the lyrics ring with a greater truth, a greater feeling of freeness.
“Someday when you leave me / I bet these memories / Follow you around.”
These lyrics, from the bridge of “Wildest Dreams,” take on new meaning in the re-recording, in the aftermath of the loss of her masters. It’s as if Swift were warning Braun and Borchetta that the unfairly-kept masters will haunt them forever. (It’s also reminiscent of a line from the bridge of “My Tears Ricochet,” off of her pandemic-masterpiece “Folklore,” where she sings: “And when you can’t sleep at night / You hear my stolen lullabies.”)
But becoming embittered with her past and fixated on revenge seems not to be of very much interest to Swift. Not anymore. At this point in her career — in her life, even — she seems at peace. Indeed, her creativity seems to be flourishing, more so than ever; let Swifties across the world be encouraged by this, in knowing that they have a long future of beautiful music (both new and re-imagined) to look forward to.

CW: Suicide
Seasoned Broadway-goers and casual theater fans alike have all most likely heard of “Dear Evan Hansen,” the smash-hit, six-time Tony Award-winning musical. Based on the book of the same name by Steven Levenson and adapted for the stage by the duo Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, “Dear Evan Hansen” tells the story of a lonely teenager with severe social anxiety who unintentionally becomes a local hero in the wake of a classmate’s death by suicide. The original musical opened on Broadway in 2016 with Ben Platt (“Pitch Perfect”) playing the titular Evan Hansen. Now five years and nine Tony nominations later, “Dear Evan Hansen” has been adapted from stage to screen.
“Dear Evan Hansen” was released on Sept 24 with Ben Platt reviving his role as Evan Hansen. The film’s new star-studded cast includes powerhouses Julianne Moore (“Still Alice”) as Evan’s mother, Heidi Hansen; Amandla Stenberg (“The Hate U Give”) as Alana, the most popular girl in school and Evan’s unlikely friend; Amy Adams (“Arrival,” “American Hustle”) as Cynthia Murphy, Connor’s mother, the young man who takes his life, and Zoe Murphy, Evan’s love interest.
On Aug. 25, the stars of the film were joined by director Stephen Chbosky (“The Perks of Being a Wallflower”) and writer Steven Levenson for a virtual roundtable to talk about their upcoming film. The conversation touched on many topics, ranging from teen mental health to the power of social media. The cast and creators of the film reflected on their experiences working on a project with such a heavy but important topic at its center, as well as what they hoped viewers would take away from watching Evan Hansen’s story. A recurring theme of the discussion, much like in the film, was the importance of recognizing that your life matters and that you are not alone.
“From the writing perspective, that was always really important to us, from the beginning, that we leave this story with some hope,” said Levenson of the uplifting elements that shine through at the end of the film. “We wanted — especially knowing that young people were going to see this — to be clear that hope was possible, that change was possible. And that just because someone does something terrible, even if it’s reprehensible, they can still be okay and move on and be okay.”
Although the film puts a great focus on the mental health of young people — high school students, in particular — themes of family and grief are also present in the plot and were discussed during the roundtable.
When asked how she took on doing justice to the daunting role of a grieving mother, Adams spoke on the significance of looking inward.
“The whole process of acting requires a huge amount of empathy — especially when you’re handling something so delicate and such an unimaginable loss. Whenever I’m approaching a character of that magnitude and I really want to make sure that I’m open and receptive, it really is just about tapping into deep empathy,” said Adams.
“If you’re lucky enough, you get to do it with wonderful actors [like] Danny and Kaitlyn,” Adams said pointing to her co-stars Danny Pivo (“Law and Order: SVU”) and Kaitlyn Dever (“Booksmart”) who play her husband Larry and her daughter Zoe, respectively.
At times, the conversation had the actors reflecting on their own mental health journeys and how they conveyed characters who are on similar paths.
“I was really excited to be playing a Black girl who’s on medication because having conversations about medication are not super normalized in the Black community, or at least not in my family,” said Stenberg about her character, Alana, a successful and well-liked student who also struggles with her mental health.
Similarly reflective and grateful sentiments were expressed by the cast when it came to shooting a film about mental health and isolation during Covid-19.
“I think everybody felt just so unbelievably grateful to be at work and to be connecting with other people and to be able to hug people. To be able to hug Amy and to hug Danny in a scene, it was like ‘Oh my God, this hasn’t happened in so long!’” said Dever.
“That energy was really really palpable on set. I think we were all very much aware of the fact that this film really is essentially about feeling alone and feeling isolated and in your own way. And by the end, [it’s] about allowing the audience to feel seen in some way. I think that’s what everybody is striving for right now after the past over-a-year we’ve been through. I think we’re all looking to feel seen and heard and feel less alone — and the movie does that,” continued Dever.
Pivo and Adams agreed.
When asked what his hopes are for young people who will see the film, Platt answered simply, echoing similar sentiments to Dever: “I hope that [the film] makes people feel less alone.”
“I think that young people should feel unique and in as many ways as possible. But the one way in which I hope that it makes them feel entirely not unique is that everyone is lonely at sometime, everyone is isolated at sometime, and everybody is struggling in some way internally with their mental and emotional health. And there is nothing shameful about that. There’s nothing that makes you unloveable if you’re struggling,” Platt continued with an optimistic lesson.
“It’s not a burden for you to communicate that struggle to friends, to family. It’s not something that you need to keep a lid on, and will in fact make you a more loveable and beautiful and vulnerable person that people want to confide in when you open up about your own struggle.”

On Sept. 23, Nintendo announced via its online presentation Nintendo Direct that it will be releasing a new animated Super Mario movie in 2022 with Illumination Studios. The cast includes “The Queen’s Gambit” star Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach, Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong, and comedian Keegan-Michael Key as Toad. Who gets to play the lead role of Mario? Perhaps, Danny Devito — with his scratchy New Jersey Italian accent — snatched the role? Or maybe the honor is bestowed upon comedian T.J. Miller, who led the equally star-studded ensemble of the “The Emoji Movie?” These were just a few of the possibilities floating around the internet.
Unfortunately for Nintendo pundits, however, the answer is Chris Pratt.
To be fair, Pratt is an excellent actor, garnering much love from fans for his roles as Star-Lord in “Guardians of the Galaxy” and Emmet in “The Lego Movie.” However, he seems out of place in the ostensibly comedy-heavy cast given his recent action roles. Alongside personalities such as Rogen, Jack Black, and Charlie Day, Pratt possesses the least comedic presence, which should not be the case for the lead role in any star-studded movie. He’s not even Italian. Even Ryan Reynolds, frankly, would have made a better choice.
Casting aside, is a Mario movie necessary in the first place? The majority of the fun of the Mario universe arguably comes from getting to play as the characters, whether in “Mario Kart” or “Super Smash Bros.” Watching them on screen as a passive viewer can take away from the intimacy and connection millions of children (and adults) have crafted with the characters throughout the years.
Still, this is not the first time the Mario brothers and Mushroom Kingdom have come to the big screen. “The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!” aired in 1989, and its legacy survives today through memes and YouTube Poops. Then came the 1993 live-action feature “Super Mario Bros.,” often forgotten in the world of all-things Mario, which garnered a whopping 28% on Rotten Tomatoes and depicted the lovable brothers not too differently from ‘70s porn stars. It also featured extremely disturbing goombas.
Here’s to hoping the third time’s the charm. With more than a year still to go before the premiere, widespread cynicism about the film may be a bit premature. For all we know, Chris Pratt may absolutely shine as Mario and win his first Academy Award nomination. However, it is important to shine light on the disappointing trends in the film industry that this new project represents, notably the plethora of remakes and miscastings. All too often, especially in animated features, compatible actors are pushed to the side to make room for big names. (Because Sir Patrick Stewart was so pivotal to “The Emoji Movie,” right?) In order to draw customers to the theater, actors are cast into roles that simply don’t make sense for them.
Regardless, fans might as well enjoy the ride. So sit back, relax, and listen to Seth Rogen’s laugh come from a 200-pound animated gorilla.

“Northern Exposure” is the type of throwback TV show that your mother loved. Text her about it now, and I’ll bet that she even mentions the moose in the title sequence.
Its premise is simple enough: a young doctor from New York City must move to the backwoods of Alaska as part of his scholarship to Columbia’s medical school. While the first season sets up a classic fish-out-of-water comedy, the show truly finds its bearings as a piece of longform magical realism in its second season. With episodes including dream swaps, ghosts, fake twins, and even Franz Kafka, “Northern Exposure” constantly challenges its audience intellectually while effortlessly straddling the line between comedy and drama.
Beyond the series’ groundbreaking redefinition of TV genres, the complex female, Jewish, and Native American characters at the heart of “Northern Exposure” make it intensely compelling. It even included the second same-sex wedding story arc ever featured on American primetime television. Where minority representation on renowned dramedies such as WB’s Gilmore Girls or even NBC’s M*A*S*H is often sorely lacking, Northern Exposure bakes it into the show’s very foundation. From the exploration of protagonist Joel Fleischman’s (Rob Morrow) experience as a Jewish man in rural Alaska to the central role of indigenous teen movie buff Ed Chigliak (Darren E. Burrows), “Northern Exposure” achieves what many sitcoms of its era overlook: a soulful portrayal of characters beyond shallow stereotypes.
Through its five-year run, “Northern Exposure” received high ratings, consistent viewership, and 39 Emmy nominations. As bizarre as “Cop Rock” and as funny as “Seinfeld,” “Northern Exposure” was truly a product of its era, ushering in the new golden-age of television with an easy sense of wit and eccentricity. So where did it go? In the vast landscape of critically-acclaimed ‘90s television, why do programs like “Buffy The Vampire Slayer” and “Dougie Howser” still loom large where “Northern Exposure” has since fallen into obscurity?
To contemplate this question, consider the fate of its most frequent point of comparison, “Twin Peaks.” Airing its pilot just three months prior to that of “Northern Exposure,” television series “Twin Peaks” is widely regarded as some of the best TV and cinematic art of the 20th century. Its surreal satirization of the soap opera format stabs at American audiences’ uncritical engagement with television while pushing its viewers to think deeply about the darker elements of small-town life. Broadly speaking, comparisons between the two series are apt: Each employs thematic magical realism, the setting of a seemingly idyllic Northern town, a quirky ensemble cast, and a protagonist on the outside of it all. Yet where one’s legacy endures, the other’s seems to have stopped dead in its tracks.
The key reason for this is accessibility. With a Hulu or CBS All Access subscription, you can stream every single season of “Twin Peaks.” One of the greatest gifts that apps like Netflix and Hulu can give us is a casual introduction to media that we may never have encountered otherwise. Without its prime spot on Netflix’s “Top Picks” section, I wouldn’t have watched “The IT Crowd,” for instance, as I was three years old when it premiered to mixed reviews. Now, it’s one of my favorite television comedies. As “Northern Exposure” cannot be streamed anywhere due to a music rights conflict between the show’s creators and the artists on its soundtrack, it hasn’t received the same “exposure” over the years. While old viewers may look back on the program fondly, a wholesale revival of fan excitement seems unlikely without the support of an active streaming service.
On top of this, “Northern Exposure”’s genre-bending qualities can make it a hard sell. To define it as a comedy is to vastly limit its scope, though its quirky sense of humor is one of the series’ best characteristics. To say that it’s about a doctor from New York City adapting to life in a small town is true, though this simple description significantly discounts the intelligence of the show’s plotlines. And while its surreal elements are certainly prominent, it lacks all pretension and doesn’t have the immediate cultural cachet of “Twin Peaks.” While this is in part because it’s not as well-known, it’s also because the premise of “Northern Exposure” seems a lot less serious than that of an FBI-investigated murder mystery. But each are challenging and unconventional pieces of art and they use different qualities to express different messages, neither of which is inherently more valuable than the other.
Perhaps part of me should be happy that “Northern Exposure” isn’t likely to become a mainstream hit again anytime soon. I do always feel unreasonably cool when I explain that my favorite TV show is a ‘90s surrealist dramedy set in rural Alaska. But “Northern Exposure” is too good not to be shared. From its well-researched representation of a Native Alaskan community to its incorporation of magical realism into a sitcom format, this show brings countless exceptional elements to the table. If you have any time coming up, I recommend utilizing Harvard’s “Tech Loan” service at Lamont to grab a DVD player and borrow the box set of “Northern Exposure” from Widener. I can guarantee that you’ll be watching something unique in style, tone, and perspective.

What do assassins look like? Are they strictly agents of chaos and disruption, leaving only bloodshed and terror in their wake? Or are they artists in disguise, navigating an already-violent world with grace and compassion? Assassins take on many roles — scourges of empires, political philosophers, perhaps even the heroes of the story. When brought to the big screen, these questions demand an answer that honors the colorful moral complexities underlying the high-flying action and masterful swordplay. Director Zhang Yimou delivers all this and more in “Hero” — a martial arts film that transcends genre, time, and the laws of gravity.
Zhang’s film drops viewers into ancient, warring China, where the Qin empire nears total conquest of all rival kingdoms. Nameless (Jet Li), a small-town officer, is granted an audience with the king (Chen Daoming) after claiming to have slain three assassins opposing Qin imperialism. The king, rendered suspicious after previous attempts on his life, normally forbids anyone from coming within a hundred paces of his person, but Nameless’s feat is enough to earn a chance to recount his battles over closer conversation. The king and his guest trade tales and plot twists, offering viewers a glimpse into the multifaceted lives of the three assassins — Long Sky (Donnie Yen), Broken Sword (Tony Leung), and Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung).
In the same way the warriors’ brilliant combat mirror their talents in other pursuits — chess playing, calligraphy, storytelling, etc. — the complex themes in “Hero” are informed by striking visuals and aesthetics. Zhang breaks the film into chapters, not just chronologically, but to portray different retellings of the same events. Each of these chapters is intentionally washed with a dominant color that contrasts with the king’s neutral-toned palace and the grey hordes of the Qin army. For instance, the harmony and ambition of two young lovers is accentuated by a vibrant green forest home, while the same characters’ impulsivity and zeal manifests as their fiery red robes. The movie’s exploration of color amplifies the various emotions portrayed in each description of the past, actively painting each version of history and underscoring the message each storyteller seeks to impart.
Zhang complements this chroma-coding with deliberate attention to scale. The movie opens with alternating shots of the intimidating, mountainous landscape and the vast armies of Qin, whose might mirrors that of the infinitely imposing terrain. Yet this immensity is juxtaposed with the skill of the individual: A calligrapher changes the course of Chinese history by warming the king’s heart with the illustration of one masterful character, while the fate of the Qin empire rests in Nameless’s execution of a single sword move. Intense close-ups of assassin’s calculating, emotion-laden faces in combat achieve a quality of intimacy that feels increasingly immersive in the face of Qin dominance.
This juxtaposition leads to even more compelling revelations on ideas of home, self, and political progress. As hinted at by Nameless’ oxymoronic title, there’s much to be resolved about identity both in and above warring China: Who is Nameless relative to the king? Nameless to the masters he encounters? Each master to their homeland, and their homelands to China? The characters in “Hero” grapple with weighty questions surrounding the future of their country, forcing viewers to reflect on and reevaluate their own patriotic attitudes.
Fighting, however, takes center stage, and audiences must revel in the warriors’ competence — “How swift your sword is,” Flying Snow remarks while dueling Nameless. “Hero” falls squarely within the wuxia genre — a collection of films celebrating martial artists and their adventures. Indeed, there is potential for the movie’s numerous battle scenes to impede on its more profound subtext. Yet Zhang skillfully circumvents this distraction with meticulous choreography and extreme attention to sensory detail, transforming the genre into an effective vehicle for exploring rhythm and nuance: Between shots of the first sword swings in the film, viewers are forced to acknowledge individual raindrops that fall during the course of the battle while listening to the staccato plucks of a guzheng, a traditional Chinese instrument. Zhang manages to honor the genre, the artistic sensibility of the audience, and challenges to Chinese identity all in one effort. Oh Zhang, how swift your sword is.
While the plot of “Hero” is rooted in the livelihood of ancient warriors wielding blades, the movie feels particularly relevant to life now and for years to come; asking ourselves who we are, what we want, and what we believe in is always an important exercise. Zhang’s work remains deeply entertaining two decades after its release — a testament to the director’s ability to package such meaningful themes into a story so thrilling. “Hero” deserves audiences’ attention, in China and everywhere.

The day before the 14th annual Dance for World Festival, which took place on Sept. 25 in Harvard Square, José Mateo, founder of the José Mateo Ballet Theatre, took a moment to reflect on what he hoped attendees would get out of the event. Mateo always strove to encourage diversity and equality, values he believes originate from – but are not unique to – Cuban culture.
“Certainly in performance dance we expect the entire gamut of the human emotional experience,” he said. “But in terms of dance, social dance, and festival dance, in a community like this, the overriding sense of joy is the expectation.”
Joy was most certainly ubiquitous at Dance for World with its mosaic of performances, dance classes, food vendors, and small businesses. Despite its celebratory nature, a backdrop of social justice instilled a graver sense of shared struggle and responsibility. Though Mateo always sought to explore the intersection between performance and activism, this year it was impossible to consider the diversity of cultures at the festival without simultaneously evaluating the threats to diversity highlighted this past year. With the theme of re-emergence, visitors were forced to confront the conflict between joy at reopening and the pressing issues at hand.
Dancer Hale ‘Pinar’ Zengingouf was thrilled at the chance to celebrate her culture in front of an audience for the first time since the pandemic.
“Being on stage is such a great feeling...it brings everyone together. So I love it,” Zengingouf said. “Music and dance, they all bring people together, even if they have different backgrounds, different cultures, and when they feel the music, it just infuses you.”
Her pride in her culture is subverted by the considerable challenges she faces as an immigrant to the United States. She often feels as though she is subjected to unequal treatment on the basis of her immigrant status.
A few other individuals were in attendance at the Dance for World Festival on behalf of the Spare Change newspaper, a newspaper aiming to alleviate homelessness through advocacy and employment.
Despite the many voices given a platform through the Dance for the World Festival, Samuel Weems notes a huge segment of society that is composed of the homeless population which goes overlooked. Fellow advocate Michael Wing added:
“It’s kind of the forgotten populace that’s always around the corner, but you never see anybody like that who’s trying to fight it. And that needs to change.”
Representing traditional Hawaiian hula culture, Nila Murugan has been craving the sense of community that is built through having events in person. She said, “I can go to school again, which is helpful. In terms of dance, learning choreography, especially hula has been really difficult on Zoom. We have been able to work more as a team in person.”
In watching all the performances, Murugan sees a promising trend for the intersection between dance and social justice. “I hope that people will go to see more performances and especially the folk dancers because I think that folk dancing and traditional dancing are often overlooked from things like ballet, jazz, and tap,” Murugan said.
Dance for World shows the potential for dance to illuminate social issues. When discussing such complex problems, Mateo admits that there is not always an easy answer. Yet, he still has hope in the power of community to catalyze change.
“We do know that solutions really exist in cooperation,” he said.

Day two of Governors Ball saw the North-side rapper Aminé take over the GrubHub stage. The 27-year-old rapper and his DJ beat the midday blues by playing hype songs like “BLACKJACK” and “Can’t Decide,” the latter of which smoothly transitioned over to the chorus of J. Cole’s “pride is the devil” since the two share the same guitar loop. Although not every festival-goer knew the lyrics to every song, Aminé made sure to fill in the gaps in the audience’s knowledge with interactive ad libs, such as the countdown in the pre-chorus of “Can’t Decide.” His efforts paid off, evidently, when the crowd’s energy literally shook the ground in response.
Electric alt-pop band Muna then welcomed fans from the Honda stage. Consisting of singer Katie Gavin, guitarists Josette Maskin and Naomi McPherson, and their backing bassist and drummer, Muna’s the kind of band that makes people want to be in a band. They’re so fun to watch that the desire to join them onstage is virtually irresistible. Gavin (who wore a white tank top branded with her name in bold black letters — very camp) was ever the de facto frontwoman, though the rest of the band was equally commanding on stage, their energy unmatched from start to finish. Everpresent was Muna’s distinct brand of infectious electro-pop and Gavin’s enviable cool-girl stoicism. “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die alone in my bedroom,” Gavin sang, the massive crowd singing with her. They knew every word. And when the time came to play their latest track, “Silk Chiffon” — a song the band said was “for the gays” — the audience was greeted with a surprise appearance from track collaborator and sad girl icon Phoebe Bridgers. Bridgers, in turn, was greeted by deafening applause. But it was Muna’s undeniable stage presence that made the set truly among the most memorable of the day.
Bleachers was next, and the man of the year, Jack Antonoff, took to the GOVBALL NYC stage in Bruce Springsteen cosplay (a white cutoff tank and blue jeans) to play the band’s hits. The set began with Antonoff alone on the piano, leading the audience on before exploding into a driving, upbeat anthem. Songs like “How Dare You Want More” and “Rollercoaster” gave the set dynamic energy throughout the performance, all but begging the audience to let loose and dance and jump around with them. Antonoff himself actually did: “I’m serious, get on each other’s fucking shoulders —- this is some pre-pandemic shit!” he shouted into the crowd after calling the festival experience “all that matters.” The songs they played were undeniably poppy and fun, but it was also hard to miss that Bleachers is a musicians’ band. Each song was complemented by technically complex solos from each member of the six-piece. The best song of the set? A high-powered performance of “I Wanna Get Better.”
Wrapping up the day was King Princess with her first show in two and a half years. She welcomed her audience in typical KP fashion: “We need more pussy. We’re dying for more pussy,” she said before going into her 2018 single “Pussy is God.” The bass-heavy set took fans gathered at the BACARDÍ stage through a broad survey of King Princess’s best songs, from her most recent single, “PAIN,” to her biggest hit, “1950.” Along with the poppy, spacey tunes, the set was made by King Princess’s charisma. With each new track, she commanded the stage, connecting with the audience through her tireless dancing and constant banter. It was clear she was in her element, joking and chatting with fans from her position front and center. She shared stories about her high school years spent “blackout drunk” at the festival and, when someone threw a bra on stage, she joked, “I accept bras. I accept trinkets. I accept different types of paraphernalia.” Most notable from her already memorable set were the classic bangers “Talia,” “Cheap Queen,” and “Hit the Back,” a song she said was “made for bottoms.” The show also featured her first-ever live performance of 2018’s “Holy.” By the time the set came to a close, King Princess had taken her audience through a captivating and engaging set, with everything from light piano ballads to a raging, power chord-fueled, guitar-throwing performance of “Ohio.”

Listening to indie folk artist Faye Webster take over the Grubhub stage at Gov Ball with her ethereal blues and folk-tinged croonings was a lovely start to the day. Her band, complete with a pedal steel player joined her to add a spacey, sonically rich soundscape for Webster’s light, breezy vocals. Her invitingly candid and self-aware brand of songwriting made for an extremely intimate show, a mood only heightened by the fact virtually everybody in the crowd she attracted appeared to be a dedicated fan. Her most popular songs like the painfully honest “Right Side of My Neck” and “In a Good Way” were met with cheers from an audience that hung onto every word. “I love you!” one fan shouted, to which Webster cheekily responded, “I love you too, as a collective.” The addition of spoken word tracks like the mesmerizing 2019 track “Jonny” as well as a fun rendition of an “Animal Crossing” theme made the performance one to remember.
Next up on the same stage was electro-pop singer-songwriter Caroline Polachek, who appeared in an all-black, witchy outfit that perfectly matched her aesthetic and the dark, mystical imagery playing on the screen behind her. Known originally as a co-founder and lead singer of the synth-pop band Chairlift, Polachek kept her vocals front and center throughout her performance, playing around with the interesting riffs and whistle notes that define many of her songs. Almost equally as memorable were her choreographed dance moves, executed to match the meaning of her songs’ lyrics and to the timing of the sharp snare hits that propelled them. Popular tracks like the cerebral “Door” and the perfectly candid “Caroline, Shut Up” complemented by the addition of some yet-unreleased tracks (songs that “come from the future,” as she called them) from her upcoming album, grounded her powerful performance in audience favorites while raising excitement for what was to come. The irresistibly poppy and strikingly honest “So Hot You’re Hurting My Feelings” — delivered with captivating choreography — was a sure highlight.
Dominic Fike’s time shredding and singing on the BACARDÍ stage was powerful from start to finish. Among the most fun performances of the day, Fike’s set took his audience through all the bangers. From “Why,” the infectiously danceable song from his 2020 album “What Could Possibly Go Wrong,” to the megahit “3 Nights,” a song he admitted he has to play “every time because it made [him] famous” but that has kept its charm since its release way back in 2018, Fike kept the party going nonstop. “Together we are Dominic Fike,” the Florida native said when introducing his band, who proceeded to spend the rest of the show captivating the crowd with killer guitar solos and fiery drumming. His interactions with the audience were especially entertaining (and a welcome invitation to break from the mosh pits that dominated the set). “I tend to throw my voice out in this act here,” he said before going into “Westcoast Collective” and “Vampire,” two already energetic songs that he elevated even further with his impressive guitar skills and stage presence.
As soon as Burna Boy took the stage and the Afrobeat rhythm filled the stadium, an infectiously positive vibe radiated from the main stage. With the silhouette of a woman swaying side to side on the display behind him, Burna was feeling himself and showing off his sexy dance moves on stage, which quickly got the crowd swaying and grinding and head-bobbing along with him. His set included protest songs like “20 10 20,” which had everyone's fists raised high and united the crowd for a powerful tribute to the Lekki shooting of the same date. His DJ also got many cheers from the lively crowd after transitioning the performance into something more upbeat with the addition of Pop Smoke’s verse in the song “Enjoy Yourself.” This set created just the right energy to bridge the huge genre gap between prior act Princess Nokia and upcoming act 21 Savage.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ballet can be an elusive artistic form for those unfamiliar with it, in no small part due to its inaccessibility. Unfortunately, the opaque nature of the field often means that attempts to illuminate its inner workings fail, and these misrepresentations end up subverting the true nature of the traditional art. Nowhere is this more apparent than in films about dance. The latest addition is Amazon Studios’ “Birds of Paradise,” directed by Sarah Adina Smith and based on the novel “Bright Burning Stars” by A.K. Smalls. The film is an ambitious and fantastical psychological thriller which doesn’t shy away from emulating its predecessor “Black Swan.” Smith takes viewers into a dark web of friendship, sex, and betrayal, but disappoints in her depiction of the ballet world itself.
“Birds of Paradise” centers around two female protagonists: Kate Sanders (Diana Silvers) and Marine Durand (Kristine Froseth). Kate is an American newcomer on a scholarship at the highly competitive and foreign environment of the Paris Opera Ballet School after only training for four years. Meanwhile, Marine is the gifted star dancer of the school, as well as the daughter of the American ambassador to France, and harbors a troubled past and relationship to dance. The women share a turbulent and uncanny relationship, which starts in a (literal) catfight but quickly moves to an intense, sisterhood-level bond.
Sex underlies the entirety of the film. This is an unsurprising choice, and one that veers into problematic territory — not in the presence of sex itself, but the insinuation that dancing is inherently sexual. Early in the story, Kate goes to the star male student for help with her partnering skills. He takes her through a wildly irrelevant exercise, manipulating her body and telling her that the “perfect ballerina” is one who practices “total submission,” before having sex with her.
What is concerning beyond the questionable consent is the feeling of inevitability and the presentation of the actual work of dance as sexual. The camera work even adds to this sense, as it slinks over their limbs and often focuses on the man’s hands supporting the ballerina at her waist, sexualizing work that isn’t intended to be viewed as such. In light of the way that ballet and dance in general has a history of being hypersexualized — which i particularly damaging for young students — the way “Birds of Paradise” treats sexuality feels tone-deaf and detrimental to discourse around the topic.
The writing is often stilted and the plot twists predictable, undermining the believability of the characters and story. Scathing critiques from the ballet mistress, or a moment of empathy between Kate and the only Black woman at the school, echo with truth — but are presented in such a cliché form, and with such melodrama, that they feel inauthentic and hollow. Kate, who can’t afford to buy her own pointe shoes and has only been dancing for a few years, has potential to illuminate the inaccessibility and elitism of the ballet world, particularly in proximity to Marine, who has all the privilege and connections an aspiring ballerina could hope for. However, because the film is so focused on shock value and drama, paranoia and cattiness take the spotlight instead. Quieter moments that might generate true empathy, such as scenes of Kate putting in extra work to catch up, are relegated to a fleeting few montage shots.
When depicting the stormy and unpredictable waters of a young female friendship whose tensions are heightened by the added pressure of their artistic aspirations, “Birds of Paradise” is at its most clear and thoughtful. Kate and Marine cling to each other desperately: Kate needs a friend and guide in this foreign place, while Marine is looking for someone to fill the hole in her life left by her twin brother, who recently committed suicide. Silvers and Froseth have palpable chemistry here, and they depict the heady relationship brilliantly. But the two never quite make it off the bed of eggshells, and it is in this intricate dance of trust, competition, and search for self that the film finds an evocative story.
The actual dancing in the film is refreshingly high level, featuring true professional dancers such as Daniel Camargo (Royal Ballet), Solomon Golding (formerly Royal), or Eva Lomby. While Silvers and Forseth lack the precise technical skill of the professional dancers, they both hold their own with impressive competence, showing a clear foundation and lovely long lines. Forseth in particular shows remarkable movement quality and artistry in her contemporary solo at the end of the film.
As a film about the complexities of adolescent female friendship, “Birds of Paradise” is engaging, if a bit implausibly dramatic at times. As a dance film, however, it disappoints. Once again, the depiction of the ballet world clearly becomes secondary to the main themes of betrayal and drama, with the natural intensity of the art form used solely as a prop for a more thrilling plot. In the case of “Birds of Paradise,” this misuse is incredibly frustrating at a time when some progress towards facilitating meaningful and fruitful dialogue about issues within the industry is being made. Films about ballet can bring the traditional, exclusive, inaccessible art form to a wider audience, but they must take more care not to perpetuate harmful ideas of power, sex, and politics in the industry.

Gory, action-packed, and emotionally resonant, the new Netflix thriller “Kate” asks how much you could change if you only had one day left to live. The creative cinematography, the set design that contrasts dark streets and popping neon, and the original fight scenes alone make “Kate” worth a watch — but its plot is clever too.
“Kate” is a revenge story. And ordinarily, revenge stories can be boring: they have limited potential outcomes (either the person seeking revenge succeeds or not) and usually come to the conclusion that revenge is futile anyway. All in all, it’s a trope that is easy to make trite and banal, especially since it requires someone dying tragically enough that everyone else can be sad about it for two hours, but not so tragically that the viewer should care about the victim as an individual. “Kate,” however, sidesteps these pitfalls magnificently: The death she is avenging is her own, so no one is fridged, and the central question is far more about family and self-actualization. In fact, here revenge is just a vehicle for awesome fight scenes.
Titular protagonist Kate, portrayed by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, is an assassin ready to retire from the job when she is poisoned — she has 24 hours left to live and wants vengeance before she kicks the bucket. Instead of her fixation squandering the last of her time, it gives her final hours structure so that she can reflect on her life and make changes. Considering Kate has so little time remaining, it’s impressive that the film manages to place an emphasis on growth. The film’s genius lies in its message that no one lives in a vacuum — your choices and actions affect other people. This is a delightful reversal of the “grim, stoic assassin only works alone” trope and creates an emotional journey that is very well-executed.
Moreover, Kate’s character takes a beating. She receives every injury imaginable while taking part in half a dozen different types of fisticuffs, all while slowly dying from poison and using makeshift medicines to overcome the pain. The nonstop hits can feel a bit overdone when Kate gets whacked over the head over and over again, but considering this is a movie about death, perhaps the slightly cartoonish injuries are underscoring the fact that Kate no longer has to worry about preserving her body for the future.
Against her wishes, Kate is not alone for her emotional journey. She ends up looking after the teenaged Ani (Miku Patricia Martineau) who she has a complicated history with. Martineau’s acting is excellent as her character navigates loss, joy, and despair. She and Kate form a fraught surrogate relationship that manages to cover a lot of ground, particularly considering their lack of time together. This relationship both provides Kate with a companion and forcefully combats her down-trodden, violent tendencies, injecting the film with much needed levity and fun.
At its core, however, “Kate” is an R-rated action movie. And in this way, it excels. It’s equal parts bloody and gratuitous and well-choreographed and shot. The staging of each fight scene is distinct and creative — from a bloodbath in a restaurant to one with weaponized kitchen utensils to a gutsy street-side shoot-out.
The setting features neon pop contrasted with dark, grimy streets, creating an evocative and dynamic viewing experience as Kate barrels through the criminal underworld. None of the action is hidden from the viewer (thankfully “Kate” understands “dark and gritty” does not mean you should fire your lighting crew). Unfortunately, beyond some vague aesthetics, we don’t actually see much of Japan, where the film takes place. While “Kate” does explore a bit of fictionalized Japanese street politics and some complicated heritage through the character of Ani, it’s a shame it doesn’t consider Kate’s role as a tourist who is dying in a foreign country. All around, the film could have had more meaningful Japanese representation — while there are many minor Japanese characters, the primary characters are white Americans.
“Kate” gets off to a choppy start as they clumsily set up the protagonist’s history, but once the plot picks up this issue does not recur. There are also some obvious plot twists and running gags that don’t pay off particularly well, but the overall product forgives some of these sloppier moments.
“Kate” is a fun, cathartic, bloody experience from beginning to end. It tells the story of revenge and redemption, of family, and of recovering from your past and choosing who you want to be — even if you’ve only got one day to achieve it. It shows how much your legacy can matter, and how you can be a positive or negative force for those you leave behind. And if nothing else, it’s worth a watch for the clever and gory action.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The MBTA was overrun by Gen Z-ers in Doc Martens, ripped tights, and TikTok-esque money piece highlights last weekend as thousands made their way to Boston’s Leader Bank Pavilion for two nights of sold-out Phoebe Bridgers shows on Sept. 26 and 27.
The indie icon’s nationwide tour has come more than a year after the release of her pandemic-made sophomore album “Punisher” and features dark electro-pop trio MUNA as the opening act. (The band is signed to Bridgers’ Saddest Factory Records.)
Bridgers is known for her intoxicating juxtaposition of wrenching lyrics (songs like “Graceland Too” and “Savior Complex” stand out as obvious examples) and air of welcome irreverence in her delivery. The Sept. 27 Boston show was a testament to that duality, with Bridgers expertly toeing the line between heartbreaking and energizing. Decked out in a fittingly skeleton-inspired beaded crop top, slacks, and a black blazer, she exemplified that contrast from the very beginning. When she walked out to the Black Eyed Peas’ 2009 banger “I Gotta Feeling” (she said she once unironically put it on a playlist for her crush), she mediated it by immediately breaking out into “Motion Sickness,” a gutting rebuke of a past abusive lover couched in a sparkling, upbeat melody.
Though Bridgers isn’t alone in juxtaposing sad lyrics with a glittery exterior — artists like Maggie Rogers and Brockhampton come to mind as others — she weaponizes that juxtaposition with unprecedented precision to create a perfectly calibrated emotional experience. For the deceptively cheery songs like “Kyoto,” Bridgers whipped out a black BC Rich Warlock electric guitar for added metal flair. Her band, too, wore skeleton onesies, a stark contrast with the storybook-inspired visuals that played behind them. At other moments, the stage resembled a starry night sky, mimicking the glitter that coated Bridgers’ other guitar, a black acoustic one. Trumpeter JJ Kirkpatrick was a standout on stage, adding stunning embellishments to Bridgers’ songs in an arrangement reminiscent of her November “Copycat Killer” EP.
After so much time spent away from the stage, the performance had an added energy, refreshing and urgent as Bridgers reminisced about shows past. “This is insane,” Bridgers said of playing at the pavilion. “We played a venue here on my first record tour where the backstage was the bathroom, so this is insane.” At another point, she shared about a past Boston concert she had had with her band boygenius, where a random man started berating her and bandmate Julien Baker. “Anyway, it was really mean and it’s so cool to come back and have the opposite fucking experience,” she said.
Despite the relatively slow pace of the show — she is, in fact, a singer-songwriter — the audience was captivated throughout, as evidenced by the feverish screams that punctuated each song. When she sang “you couldn’t have stuck your tongue down the throat of somebody who loves you more,” a particularly gripping lyric from “Moon Song,” the venue shook as the audience sang along. “It’s really cool to get that kind of reaction out of, like, some folk music,” she said at one point.
Songs like “Scott Street” and “Georgia” were highlights. “I’m a little embarrassed of the melodrama” she said of “Scott Street”’s soaring climax before starting an especially powerful performance of it. But it was “I Know the End,” her closing song, that really brought the house down. Facilitated by the song’s irresistible build towards an epic climax, Bridgers was at her most powerful, captivating the audience in soaring guitar solos and vocals as a house burned down on the stage behind her.
Bridgers’ encore was a cover of Bo Burnham’s “That Funny Feeling” from his experimental comedy project “Inside,” a track she’s played at every stop on her tour so far and which she recently released on Bandcamp to raise money for Texas abortion funds. Paired with the television static on the screen behind her, the encore felt especially apocalyptic. With cutting lyrics about the generally depressing and near-apocalyptic state of the world — “A gift shop at the gun range, a mass shooting at the mall,” she sang at one point — the song made for a delightfully tense and eerie end to the night, fitting for Bridgers’ own brand of aestheticized nihilism.

Welcome to the land of late-night conversations, where the hours blur into the peaceful quiet of stolen time. My suitemate and I are regular visitors here. I lounge in a common room chair in a position that undeniably constitutes an incorrect way to sit, with my gangly legs and statement red converse hanging off the chair’s chunky arms; my friend perches above our small wooden table. We are two islands in an archipelago, a dimension and a half away from our problem sets and papers.
As the lights in neighboring suites flicker off for the night, our light persists as we zip through a maze of topics: the dynamics of friend groups and “IRL socialization,” a Quizlet of the “We’re Not Really Strangers” questions, Thai insurance commercials, the absolute perfection of the boat scene in “Tangled,” why 2018 was definitively the worst year of my life, the instant cheese from Kraft mac and cheese.
Even though I’m sure our sleep schedules resent us, our conversations are a respite, where it doesn’t matter how many times I interrupt her, entirely derail us off of topics, lose my train of thought, or launch into a TED talk about a past or present hyper-fixation. Critically, in this world, hidden in Mather’s concrete jungle, there’s no need to be anyone but ourselves; no Harvard intros and small talk, no maintaining the front that we have it all together (honestly, I don’t think anyone does), and no self-editing.
As a perfectionist with ADHD, I learned from a young age to regulate my behavior to match my environment: to “mask” or “camouflage” my ADHD, toning myself down for the comfort of others and compensating for my deficits. To clarify, masking is not “being fake” nor inventing an entirely new alter ego; rather, it is a means of navigating territories not conducive to neurodivergencies like mine. And oftentimes, keeping up the masks can become second nature.
Especially with my late diagnosis of ADHD, I’ve had a complex relationship with my “quirks,” or rather, my ADHD traits: from easily zoning out to the corners of my mind, playful clumsiness (tumbling down half a flight of stairs and getting stuck in the Science Center revolving doors in the same day), my golden retriever energy, and eagerness in conversations and interactions, the list goes on and on. They’re traits that fundamentally make me who I am, and I’ve embraced them as an integral part of myself and how I relate to the world. They make me interesting, dramatic, and relatable — a perfect main character, if you will.
And yet, in worlds that demand near perfection, they make me imperfect and occasionally make me feel like no matter how hard I try, I simply may not be good enough. Even now, I all too often find myself carefully tuning the levels of how much of myself I display, with the dreadful doubt lingering — am I “too much?” Too talkative, too energetic, too chaotic?
But, so what if I’m “too much”?
Especially with October being ADHD Awareness Month, it’s time to redefine the rules, and by being my unapologetic, unregulated self, I’m able to find affirmation and authenticity in my neurodivergency. It’s a seemingly small but mighty act of reclamation on both a personal and societal level, as it breaks down stigma and builds up empathy in our connections and communities.
On a broader level, I’m fairly certain that we can all relate to the concept of adapting our behavior to a situation, at least to some degree. After all, social norms influence how we think and behave, even if we aren’t always consciously aware. This year, in particular, we are all transitioning to the Harvard community with a plethora of pandemic perspectives and experiences. It’s a new chapter for us all. As we traverse the treacherous terrains of academics, extracurriculars, social life, and everything outside and in between, we can redefine Harvard culture to be a bit more sympathetic towards who we are and who we have become.
We stand to gain so much more from being our authentic, genuine selves. If no one else, I — the guide of the land of late-night, the girl who wrote a comedy special to Harvard as part of her application — am always here to hear your story and laugh and cry by your side from sunset to sunrise.
Ultimately, the people worthy of you are those who are down to hear the story behind why you’re banned from your kitchen at home and your lecture series on the insights about mental health, self-growth, and affirmation from a musical comedy-drama that you binge-watched over the summer.
Everyone else? Well, maybe we’ll vote them off the island.

Upon our return to the on-campus scene, our student body has seen — or at least heard — the reawakening of an equally old and exclusive fixture of Harvard’s campus: the final clubs. It is a relatively new, all-female club, however, that has been stirring up quite the buzz.
We have long maintained, and continue to maintain, that Harvard’s final clubs are a destructive force in the College’s social environment. Their elitism balkanizes our community, they monopolize off-campus social spaces, and they contribute significantly to the problem of sexual assault on campus. In the College’s 2015 sexual climate survey, nearly half of female College seniors who participated in final club life reported experiencing non-consensual sexual contact since entering Harvard, the highest of any survey subgroup.
This isn’t the first time we’ve expressed our concern over these trends, and it likely won’t be the last, as final clubs withstood both College sanctions and the financial effects of the pandemic. In retrospect, this was not surprising: Eight male final clubs are propped up by a combined $43,000,000 worth of property in Harvard Square. But in this fact alone lies the nuanced difference between male and female social clubs we’ve mentioned in the past. As long as these all-male clubs gate-keep physical off-campus social spaces and set the rules within them, there will exist a power dynamic that is, quite frankly, dangerous to College women.
For this reason, we cautiously welcome the news that the Bee Club — an all-female final club — will once again have its own clubhouse in Harvard Square.
To be sure, the hefty $2.2 million purchase of this building, which formerly housed the beloved Café Pamplona, by a current College student is a jarring reminder of the cutting wealth disparities between students on our campus. We hope that this pricey acquisition does not make low-income students doubt their belonging in Harvard’s inane social scene.
But even more so, the purchase quite literally demonstrates the price that women have to pay to gain access to social spaces that are even remotely comparable to those that men have enjoyed for decades. To that end, we are hopeful that the Bee’s flight to Harvard Square will make what we consider to be a bad social system slightly better. The women of the Bee and the social club scene are now one step closer to safer, more equal footing.
To the Bee and all other final clubs looking to create some positive buzz: We hope that your new hive serves you well, and implore that you take this moment to act as responsible leaders by creating a space that is safe and inclusive to marginalized identities. Invest not only in a clubhouse, but in a precedent of taking everyone — regardless of their income level, identity, or background — under your wing.

I used to run alone. I’d lace up my tattered sneakers, worn well beyond their recommended mileage, and run just outside the painted white lines marking the side of the road. It made sense to me. I could decide to go at a moment’s notice.
I could decide on my own when, where, and how fast to run. Running was an individual sport, after all. A contest against my watch, against myself. One of the first sensations that got me hooked on it was the sense of pride that I felt after pushing myself on a run, over all the fatigue and pain. It was the sense of accomplishment a lot of runners feel after a hard, honest effort. I truly felt my mind, my mental fortitude, played just as important a role as my legs.
One day, almost randomly, I agreed to go on a run with a friend. We didn’t chat much, we didn’t decide on a pace beforehand; we merely exchanged occasional glances and hand gestures to indicate if we were going left or right at the next fork in the road. We didn’t need to talk to understand we were working together, we were a team. No different from a doubles team in tennis, or a pairs team in figure skating. It was blissful. I imagine that many runners, from the casual jogger to the competitive marathoner, know this feeling. It’s remarkable that a solo endeavor like running has the immense power to forge such bonds between us.
“What I Talk About When I Talk About Running,” a memoir by novelist Haruki Murakami, was gifted to me by a close friend. You might be familiar with his more well-known works like “Kafka on the Shore” or “Norwegian Wood,” but what does he have to say about long-distance running? What does writing novels have to do with running marathons? In Murakami’s case, the answer is, really, everything. Lessons learned from running marathons became indispensable in his life as a writer. Focus, endurance, rest, limits — all of it brought to bear in his writing process.
Here’s another running phenomenon. People like listening to music while running. We say music is an art, and running is a sport. But despite these classifications, which are so frequently juxtaposed, they complement each other so well. Isn’t it incredible how a combination of different audio frequencies and rhythms arranged in a certain way can make the strenuous tempo of running feel easier, more modulated?
Running isn’t just about the miles and minutes. I fell in love with it because it’s about both mind and body, connecting and keeping pace with one another. I learned from my friend that it can be solitary yet social. Murakami found the liminal space between writing novels and running marathons. It brings together art and sport. It builds connection with our “teammates” and within ourselves. Running is a place where we embrace these unexpected, yet wonderful, intersections. And it can remind us to open our eyes to other crossroads, too.
Coalescing diverse methodologies and sensibilities from seemingly disparate areas creates so much value. In academia, the digital humanities combines data science with theoretical paradigms in the humanities. Quantitative social science leverages computational techniques to describe complex social phenomena. We ought to embrace the crossroads of qualitative and quantitative. There is so much to uncover at their nexus. Like running with a friend, these two supposedly independent forces can intersect and compel one another.
When Covid-19 dispersed us to all corners of the world, we missed running into one another in the dining halls. We missed waving to a familiar face from across the lecture hall and walking with each other along the Charles, talking about everything and nothing. We missed the serendipitous interactions in our lives, and the intersections between our ideas that these chance encounters facilitated. Time apart has made me cherish more than ever the ways different aspects of our lives can combine to create something greater than the sum of their parts.
I still run beside the painted white line along the side of the road. But now, instead of just following straight lines, I seek out intersections. Everywhere I look, there’s a new crossroads, with something awesome to discover.

Fourteen seniors were announced on Sept. 24 as senior class marshals for the Class of 2022.
The marshals, who collectively comprise the Senior Class Committee, are responsible for organizing class-wide events leading up to Commencement Exercises in May. The committee also plans post-graduation reunion events and coordinates Senior Gift fundraising efforts.
After two rounds of elections, which were open to all students in the Class of 2022, Menatallah N. “Menat” Bahnasy ’22 and Ruth H. M. Jaensubhakij ’22 were named First and Second Marshals, respectively.
Bahnasy, who received the notice by a phone call on Friday morning in the midst of classes, said she is “really thrilled” to oversee the planning of the committee.
“What I’m most looking forward to is helping to reconnect our class,” Bahnasy said. “I think that that’s really important for our class — not only to have opportunities to reconnect via events and via other initiatives, but also to meet as many people as possible.”
Jaensubhakij said she looks forward to building camaraderie among the Class of 2022.
“Over the past year and a half, our class has been very fractured, and now a lot of people are now juniors — there’s a whole bunch of people who have been added to our class who were in the Class of 2021,” Jaensubhakij said. “I’m really excited to just bring people together and have us feel a sense of unity as the Class of 2022.”
Bahnasy acknowledged the challenges presented by the pandemic and social distancing guidelines, which have reshaped usual senior week activities and events.
“This pandemic is not over yet, and I think that it’s really important to continue following the guidelines that were given with the school,” Bahnasy said. “There are some really creative ways to still be engaged together.”
“I think that we will have a lot of opportunity to be able to expand from the limitations that we’ve had over the last two years,” Bahnasy added.
Arjun J. Prasad ’22, one of the six Program Marshals, said he looks forward to connecting members of the Class of 2022, as seniors now and later on as alumni. The program marshals are those who place third through eighth in the election process.
“One of my favorite things from my three years and a month now has just been meeting such amazing people,” Prasad said. “Making people want to stay connected to each other and to the school that brought us all together – I think that’s what I’m most most excited for.”
In addition to the eight marshals, six seniors were appointed Gift Marshals by the Harvard College Fund after an application and interview process. They will help lead the senior gift campaign.
In the coming weeks, the class marshals will interview candidates to make up the remainder of the Senior Class Committee: the secretary, treasurer, media team, and house representatives.
Abigail T. “Abby” Forbes ’22, a Gift Marshal, said she hopes to change students’ perceptions of the Senior Gift.
“As a [low-income] student who’s really passionate about resource activation and about everyone doing the little things they can that will generate huge, huge, opportunities over time, I really wanted to dismantle any stereotypes that would prevent people from feeling a part of the gift process,” Forbes said.
“We are the first class to have a year-and-a-half away from campus, away from our friends,” Forbes also said. “To have that taken away and come back, re-emerge, and re-embrace what you want your Harvard experience to ideally look like is something that I’m really excited to leverage a vision around.”

Harvard decreased the testing cadence for vaccinated affiliates in undergraduate housing on Monday in response to a decrease in positive Covid-19 tests among undergraduate students.
Harvard had upped the testing requirements for College housing affiliates at the start of the fall semester because of an increase in cases. At the time, Dean of Students Katherine O’Dair deemed the rise in cases “a turning point.”
Since then, the number of positive cases among undergraduates has steadily declined. Over the last seven days, the University detected two positive cases in undergraduates, in contrast to 71 cases during the week of Aug. 26, according to the University’s Covid-19 Dashboard.
In an email to College students sent Monday afternoon, O’Dair and Executive Director of Harvard University Health Services Giang T. Nguyen announced that undergraduate residential affiliates now only need to test twice per week instead of three times per week due to the decline in cases.
“Thanks to your commitment to behaviors that help us lower the risk of transmission, the rate of positive COVID-19 cases in our undergraduate population declined and has remained low,” they wrote.
Students and staff residing in undergraduate housing who are unvaccinated still must continue to test three times per week.
O’Dair and Nguyen also told affiliates in their email that testing cadences are subject to vary as public health conditions on campus continue to change.
“We will continue to adjust testing cadences as needed, including if we see positive cases rise,” they wrote. “We will also revisit testing cadence at key times, such as during the return from Thanksgiving break, when we know the risk may be higher due to many travelers arriving back to campus.”
They urged students to continue following Covid-19 protocols, including wearing masks and staying in one’s suite when experiencing symptoms.
“While our testing cadence is changing given current circumstances, it is contingent upon our continued commitment to behaviors that reduce transmission and contribute to the health and safety for our community,” O’Dair and Nguyen wrote.
Harvard Business School also returned to in-person classes on Monday after shifting some courses online for a week in response to a Covid outbreak the school attributed to off-campus social gatherings.
The school decided to move classes online for all first-year and some second-year MBA students last week after counting 121 cases among MBA students since July 1, with close to 60 students in isolation that day, per an email that several HBS administrators wrote to all MBA students.
During the month of September, HBS students, who make up around nine percent of the student body, accounted for over two-thirds of total student cases, the administrators’ emailed statement noted.
After a brief period of online classes, on Monday HBS students returned in person to their classrooms.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council passed a policy order with unanimous consent to establish a plan to increase minority representation in municipal government leadership positions in its Monday meeting.
Sponsored by Councilor E. Denise Simmons, the policy will prioritize Black and Indigenous residents along with other residents of color.
As part of the order, the Council requests City Manager Louis A. DePasquale draft a plan to ensure that more individuals from those groups are recruited, trained, and given opportunities for leadership positions in city government.
“As you go up the ranks, it’s glaringly apparent that we do not have the same kind of diversity that we hold other people accountable to,” Simmons said.
“We should be abhorred and verklempt that we have done so poorly for so long,” she continued. “I’m hoping that my colleagues not only will adopt it, but will put their shoulder to the wheel of moving equity and access forward for underrepresented people and women in our city.”
Simmons also asked the Council to amend the wording of the policy order to explicitly include the Latinx community.
Later in the meeting, the Council also requested that DePasquale provide the appropriate staff and information needed to review and expand the Green Jobs program, which works to promote the City’s sustainability efforts and address climate change.
This policy order was sponsored by Simmons, Councilor Marc C. McGovern, Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon, and Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan.
Zondervan said he is glad the Green Jobs program is back on the Council’s radar, explaining that he believes the program will bring about economic opportunity.
“Looking at what we’ve done over the last 10, 20 years — what has worked, what hasn’t worked — is really valuable in making sure that as we move forward, we ensure that the program is successful,” Zondervan said.
“It is really important to create more economic opportunity and to expand the types of jobs that we think about when we think about green jobs,” he added.
Simmons said she believes it is essential that government prioritize people of color in future programs that tackle climate change.
“When we talk about the environmental movement, it is woefully absent of people of color,” Simmons said.
Per Simmons, prioritizing people of color in the Green Jobs program is "an extraordinary way" to "engage and enlarge the interest of this often missed community."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Graduate Council held a vote for seven chair positions Monday evening, finalizing its slate of executive leadership for the 2021-22 academic year.
The Council holds two cycles of elections in the spring and fall, respectively. Ten chair positions, as well as the president and vice president, comprise the 12-member executive board.
Chair positions are grouped in “functional pairs” that allow for increased inter-board collaboration, per HGC Vice President Himaja Nagireddy.
“We have a fall election so people — even if they’re new to Harvard, if they’re new to student government — can still participate in a meaningful way at HGC,” she said.
“That’s why we have functional pairs,” Nagireddy added. “For each chair position that we nominate in the spring, we have a chair position that we nominate in the fall, and they work together.”
Carlos A. Gonzalez Sierra, a joint-degree student at the Harvard Kennedy School and Harvard Law School, said he hopes to help clarify constitutional procedures that guide Council meetings in his new role as chair of governance.
“The Chair of Governance is responsible for ensuring the constitution is most up to date, and that there are no inconsistencies, that there are no ambiguities and defects that could cause potential conflicts between the different schools,” he said.
“After having reviewed the constitution, I noticed there are things that I would like to help the Council resolve — that’s what I’m going to be working on the most,” he added.
Harvard Graduate School of Education student Kathleen Dillon, who will serve as this year’s chair of finance, said she looks forward to leveraging the Council’s budget to foster fellowship amongst students and faculty.
“What I’m most excited about is being able to build events in the community — that means with students, faculty,” she said. “So making the most of the budget that we have, and just creating great opportunities.”
Nagireddy said she is energized to collaborate with the incoming board to gauge student opinions on urgent issues, and more proactively anticipate their needs.
“[HGC President] Peter [Choi] and I really want to make sure that we’re being inclusive of everyone’s ideas, and through our executive board, also getting a pulse on what students’ opinions and thoughts are on really important issues — and how we as a board can be more responsible to that, and more proactive with anticipating student needs,” she said.
“The expertise of this board and the interests of this board — the new one that we’re electing tonight — is a great example of how we’re going to be moving forward,” Nagireddy added.
Other chair positions elected Monday evening include Law School student Janet Park as Chair of Operations, Graduate School of Education student Shankar Ravi as Chair of Student Groups, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences student Landon A. Fortenberry as Chair of Community Engagement, Graduate School of Education student Max Espinoza as chair of Policy, and Extension School student Troy McDonald as Chair of Communications.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Consecutive weekends of back-to-back wins bumped Harvard field hockey to No. 12 in the country. Exciting victories over Columbia and Bucknell, and then against the University of Pennsylvania and University of New Hampshire the following weekend brought the team’s overall win-loss tally to 9-1, marking an incredible start to the season.
The squad’s first few weeks are doubly impressive coming off a year-long break and a cancelled 2020 season. For 10 of the 25 team members, this is their first competitive season with the Crimson, and for many of the returning members, it has been over a year since playing field hockey for Harvard. Settling into the team dynamic has been exciting for returning and new members alike.
“Our team has a very strong bond and a very good team environment,” said senior co-captain Hannah Pearce. “It’s been really fun to get back to playing after such a long break, [and] it’s been great to be back with [everyone] and be playing hockey again.”
Coach Tjerk Van Harwaarden also shared his thoughts on the Crimson’s return to the field. “We picked up and kept doing what we were doing before COVID – winning games, building this program and building as a team, and to that extent I think we’re doing really well,” said Van Harwaarden.
Despite the extended departure from a fixed training regimen, the team was able to come back physically and mentally prepared for the 2021 season. During the pandemic, the squad was scattered, some players taking leaves of absence while others engaged in online school or work. However, everyone displayed admirable diligence and commitment to preparing for a hopeful return.
“They knew what was necessary to do while they weren’t on campus and they did it,” said Van Harwaarden. “Everybody focused hard on the fitness component and I think that is showing right now in some of the games… Last weekend against Columbia we were able to outplay our opponent significantly in the fourth quarter just because of our fitness level.”
The decisive 4-1 win over Columbia was undoubtedly a highlight of the season so far. The team is striving for its sixth Ivy League championship title this year, and the Columbia and Penn games were both promising and confidence-boosting.
“Obviously our [first Ivy League] win was a big thing for us, that’s our conference, it’s a tournament that we want to win, so coming off of that first game with a win against Columbia was a really great experience,” said Pearce.
Pearce, who spent her past year playing with the South African women’s national field hockey team in an Olympic bid, has been a defensive powerhouse alongside junior goalkeeper Ellie Shahbo. Pearce also scored two goals against Columbia, which she noted as a personal highlight from the first few games and something she rarely has the opportunity to do as a defender. Shahbo has been credited with shutouts for six of the ten games played thus far and currently leads the NCAA rankings for the lowest goals against average, allowing only 0.313 goals per game. In addition to Pearce and Shahbo’s strong recent performances, co-captain Mimi Tarrant rode a stellar weekend performance to earn the Ivy League’s Offensive Player of the Week award last week. Tarrant took home the award after a strong weekend that saw two assists against Columbia and one against Bucknell.
Coaches and players alike commented that the biggest challenge of the season so far has not been on the field, but rather the readjustment to the rhythm of college life. The welcome return to normalcy has been difficult as players have to reacquaint themselves with the balancing act of Harvard’s rigorous academic demands and a time-consuming practice and competition schedule. When asked about his coaching mentality and how he defines success for his team, Van Harwaarden of course placed emphasis on the team’s win-loss record, but also commented on the strict academic expectations for his players and refusal to make sacrifices in the classroom.
“As soon as they graduate Harvard, there has to be a bigger picture, and we look at field hockey as a great way to go through college, not a reason to go to college,” said Van Harwaarden. “We keep that in mind and we enjoy what we do; that’s what this program is for.”
With ten games completed and seven remaining in the regular season, the Crimson is focusing on the five remaining Ivy League matchups. Even though there haven’t been significant challenges on the field thus far, there is something to be learned from every opponent, and the team has been subtly improving its play throughout the first few weeks. With Yale and Dartmouth on the horizon for the next couple weekends, the Crimson hopes to continue their strong performance with two more Ivy wins.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past weekend, Harvard (5-7, 2-1 Ivy League) traveled to Penn (4-8, 1-2 Ivy League) and Princeton (9-2, 3-0 Ivy League) for a pair of conference matchups, delivering a win against the Quakers on Friday and dropping a close contest to the Tigers on Saturday.
In Friday’s match, after a tie early on, the Crimson broke away, winning the first set, 25-13. The second set was a different story, however. Facing a 22-16 Penn lead, Harvard hit six kills to tie it up. Despite this comeback, a kill and a block by sophomore outside hitter Emerson Flornes eventually sealed the second set for the Quakers, 30-28.
During the second set, sophomore right side hitter/setter Ashley Wang went down with an ankle injury. Losing Wang, a standout player throughout the season thus far, was a huge blow for Harvard.
“It was a blur after that,” first-year libero Lindsey Zhang said. “We were scrambling to make adjustments.”
The Crimson did not waste time making those adjustments, as it did not lose another set, winning the next two 26-24 and 25-19. Sophomore middle hitter Olivia Cooper chalked the changes up to the team’s flexibility.
“[Assistant] coach Nick [Clark] said that Ashley would want [us] to play well without her, so [a number of players] stepped up and did a wonderful job,” Cooper said.
“At a certain point, we all came together and said, ‘no matter what, we need to keep fighting,’” Zhang recalled. “We were able to come back and gain a lot of momentum in that second set, even though we just lost by two points. I think the momentum we gained from coming back from that huge deficit in the second set really helped us in the third and fourth sets to close it out.”
Streaks characterized the third and fourth sets. In the third, the Crimson had to erase an early Penn lead until it could gain an advantage with a four-point run. First-year outside hitter Nicole Prescott then sealed the set with a kill. The fourth set went largely the same way, with an early 10-10 tie broken by a six-point streak by Harvard. Although the gap narrowed toward the end, a Crimson five-point run ensured Penn never got too close, and another kill by Prescott ended the match.
Zhang and Cooper both stepped up against Penn, with the former registering a team-best 20 digs and the latter serving a team-best two aces. Sophomore outside hitter Katie Vorhies continued her stellar season with 16 kills and five blocks, while junior right side attacker and co-captain Jaimie Rao and Prescott recorded 12 each. Defensively, sophomore setter Bella Almanza had 12 digs, which along with her 24 assists gave her her second double-double of the season, and sophomore middle blocker Ariana White posted a team-high eight blocks.
With its victory over Penn, the Crimson extended its win streak to four. However, the streak ended at the hands of a persistent Princeton squad. The teams traded sets to send the match into a fifth set sprint to 15 points. Although Harvard held a 12-8 lead, the Tigers snatched victory from the jaws of defeat, tying the score and then closing out the match, 15-13.
“In the first half of the [fifth] set, we went on a nice service run from [Rocky Aguirre],” Cooper said. “She served about four [points] in a row, but then we got stuck in a rotation that we had gotten stuck in a few times earlier on in the game.”
This challenge referred to Princeton’s junior setter Lindsey Kelly, whose serve proved troublesome for the Crimson.
“The momentum shifted, and we struggled to get it back,” Cooper said. “That was the difference. She had a great serve, she served well the whole match, and she [especially] served well in a clutch moment for them.”
Every set of the match was competitive. The first set started in gridlock as the two squads traded points until they both crossed the halfway mark at 13-13.
Then Kelly stepped up to the line.
Her serve gave the Tigers an eight-point run before Harvard, reeling from the loss of Wang the previous day, could stop the bleeding. Although the team fought back in its attempt to save the opener, this streak proved too much. Princeton took the first set, 25-20.
As has often been the case this season, the Crimson had to play from behind. The team under head coach Jennifer Weiss, however, has also shown its ability to adjust.
“We switched our rotations around, trying to give them a different look,” said Zhang about Weiss’s strategy going into the second set, “especially since [Princeton’s] blockers were doing really well.”
With the Tigers facing different Harvard hitters, the Crimson jumped out to an early 7-0 lead. On Saturday, three hitters contributed 42 of the team’s 63 kills, as Vorhies tallied 19 kills, Prescott hit 12, and Cooper recorded 11. Although Princeton clawed its way back from this deficit, Harvard held onto the reins, narrowly edging out the second set 26-24.
In the third, however, the Tigers regained control, starting with a six-point run and a 12-4 lead. The Crimson never fully recovered, eventually losing 25-16. The team thus found itself one set away from defeat, but Harvard was not to be deterred.
“We showed in the second and fourth set … that we were resilient and wouldn’t give up that easily,” Zhang commented. “We were able to battle through and push for the fifth set and not let any mental mistake affect us.”
Although the beginning of the fourth set was closely contested, the Crimson pulled ahead as Cooper had a long service run that gave the team the momentum to lead 17-10. The Tigers gradually closed this gap, but Harvard hit its way to a 25-19 claim on the fourth set and sent the match to a decider before ultimately falling.
The Crimson has its work cut out for itself against its perennial rival, Yale (9-3, 2-1 Ivy League), and a fierce Brown squad (10-3, 3-0 Ivy League). Harvard is especially looking to cut down on the frequency and duration of the runs it allows its opponents. Mental toughness, as was the case after Wang’s injury against Penn, will also help the team in closely contested sets. Finally, communication and improving chemistry on a particularly young Crimson squad will keep it competitive as it heads into the depths of conference play.
“I feel excited about that loss [to Princeton],” Cooper said. “I think it really showed us our ability to compete as a team, and it was a very promising loss to lose [that closely]. I’m excited for what that loss will ignite in us and how it will fire us up this weekend against Yale and Brown.”

Scrolling through your Instagram and see yet another picture of someone with Remy the Cat? Don’t understand how everyone else has spotted Remy for the fifth time while you haven’t even seen him once? Don’t worry! Our precious Remy is hard to find, but here are some tips to help you find him.
Go to Lamont.
Tucked away in a cozy corner of the Yard, it’s no wonder Remy gravitates toward Lamont. Next time you need a study spot, head to Lamont, or take a different route to class that includes passing by the library. If you do this consistently for your whole undergraduate career, you’ll definitely find stressed out students, and you might just see Remy!
Chill in the Yard.
The best place to spot Remy is where he is living up to his name as the Guardian of the Yard (and its expensive furniture). Especially when the weather is sunny and warm and Remy is in his feels, you’ll see him sprawling out on the grass in the Yard, watching us as we walk to class while chugging our third cup of coffee of the day.
Get Catnip.
Cats have a sense of smell that’s fourteen times stronger than humans. Fourteen! Imagine how they feel about Red’s Best Catch. But this superior ability means that catnip is a wonderfully pleasant scent for them. Go to Costco (get a hot dog while you’re at it), buy bulk catnip, and leave hunks of catnip in every corner of every room (don’t skimp). The smell is bound to result in an appearance from Remy (and your building manager) at some point.
Scout Every Dorm.
Lots of people invite or take Remy into their dorm rooms. So if everything else fails, just knock on every door to every dorm in the Yard. Even if you don’t find Remy, you’ll get your steps in and probably make a few friends. This may seem like a bit too much, but it’ll all be worth it to see our friend Remy — just think about the Instagram possibilities.
These tips should help you get your star moment with Remy. But even if you don’t ever end up seeing him, I can guarantee you’ll find a few rats along the way. Looking forward to seeing that post on my Instagram feed. Good luck and happy Remy-searching!
