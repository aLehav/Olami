Weezer’s lead vocalist Rivers Cuomo begins the rock band’s latest track with a confession about his music taste: “All my favorite songs are slow and sad.”
“All My Favorite Songs,” released on Jan. 21 as the lead single from Weezer’s upcoming album “OK Human,” is sad, but it’s not especially slow. If not one of Cuomo’s favorite songs, what exactly is it trying to emulate? Despite the song’s careful orchestration, no conductor can guide it past its lack of musical direction.

The intro’s broken chords and subtle counterpoint have a certain charm but rely on a confusing combination of sounds: glockenspiel and synthesizer. The latter evokes an oboe’s reedy timbre, but the melodies’ awkward phrasing and mechanical delivery raise doubts that an actual wind player could have produced them. Compared to the cello that soon joins the track alongside Cuomo’s vocals, which at least shows some tonal variation, the intro falls flat.

Only a brief silence separates the intro from the opening chorus — an already abrupt transition made even less effective by the two sections’ lack of common elements (aside from a four-chord sequence). The strings’ expressive support provides a welcome change from the metronomic intro but still fails to set Weezer’s bland lyrics, including gratuitous repetitions such as “Walkin’ alone by myself,” in motion. Cuomo follows his description of his favorite songs with more vague laments: “All my favorite people make me mad / Everything that feels so good is bad, bad, bad.” For most of the chorus, the predictability of the accompaniment — one bow stroke per syllable — rivals that of the rhyme scheme.

As the song progresses, the addition of more instruments lends itself to sonic experimentation with varying degrees of success. The staccato chords at the beginning of the first verse feel more like an interruption than an enhancement; the violin at the end of the second reaches a startling high note as Cuomo sings about “the sound of sirens,” approaching a wonderfully cathartic wail. With an ideal setup for a bridge or instrumental break in place, it’s too bad the track returns to the trite chorus immediately after the violin soars.

“We used our instruments to connect to the 1960’s and 1970’s and, with the orchestra, back to the 18th and 19th centuries,” Weezer tweeted about their new album. Maybe viewing the orchestra as a dynamic and contemporary creative force, rather than a relic of the past, would help the band better integrate it into their work. “All My Favorite Songs” lingers somewhere between the 18th and 21st centuries, not quite knowing which it would rather inhabit.

Chock full of musical numbers, colorful Victorian costumes, flying robots, and magical glowing calculus equations, “Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey” has something for everyone. Directed by Christmas-movie veteran, David E. Talbert, Netflix's new big budget Christmas film follows genius inventor and toy maker Jeronichus Jangle (Forest Whitaker). Jangle has just created his greatest invention of all time, a fully sentient clockwork matador toy named Don Juan Diego. After being betrayed by his unappreciated apprentice, Gustafson (Keegan-Michael Key), Jangle loses the magic of invention and falls into depression. It is not until years later, when his granddaughter, Journey (Madalen Mills) comes to visit, that he rediscovers the magic of invention.
With its period setting, the movie adheres to a popular Anglo-American Christmas aesthetic, based on a murky nostalgia for the Victorian period (think “A Christmas Carol,” or “The Nutcracker,” or even just the tradition of Christmas carollers in long dresses demanding figgy pudding). However, “Jingle Jangle” enriches this otherwise heavily white tradition, featuring a predominantly Black cast and references to Ghanian culture through the use of afro-beat-heavy Christmas music and costumes that designer Michael Wilkinson refers to as “afro-victorian.”
Jingle Jangle’s cast of characters is charming, quirky, and uplifting. A notable example is young, bright would-be inventor Journey Jangle, played brilliantly by Madelen Mills. Journey can't just belt out a tune — she also loves math and is amazing at it. In fact, Talbert’s playful portrayal of math is one of the great successes of the film. Along with her Grandpa and friend Edison, Journey takes the square root of “possible” and finds the derivative of “spectacular,” all while using magic to mark her calculations. It's easy to imagine a young girl watching this movie and being excited about becoming a mathematician or an inventor, just like Journey.
The amount of love that has been poured into this film is clear — and so is the money. Everything from the costumes to CGI robots and toys are stunning and visually engaging. With its opulent sets, costumes, and special effects, the movie builds a world of endless whimsy, adventure, and discovery.
The almost steampunk CGI aesthetic in the film is generally gorgeous, and Diego’s design is no exception. However, the minute the tiny matador robot begins to speak and move, his slightly-humanoid, slightly-robotic gestures make him appear incredibly off putting. To be fair, though, uncanny valley animation is a hallmark of Christmas films (see “The Polar Express”), so perhaps this is just an extension of that trope.
In addition to being just a little scary, Diego’s very existence raises important questions about the power Jeronichus Jangle is capable of wielding. Diego is sentient and seems to possess free will; his main motivation in the film is his desire to avoid being “mass produced” and sold to children as a toy. Unwittingly, “Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey” raises several haunting questions about the border between technology and humanity. Why is it that this toy is denied the right to self-determination? If Diego is capable of thinking and feeling things, why is he not considered human?
Existential questions and plot holes aside, “Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey” is a lot of fun and a refreshing addition to the Christmas movie cannon, marking, hopefully just the beginning of Netflix’s increased investment in BIPOC voices and stories.

Consider this: if the prickly, stimulating, ravishing feeling of bliss had a sound, it would be Rihanna cued on the turntable. Bliss can go long — passed through drugs, money, sex, and other such classified vices, it tends to extend into the sublime. It’s so good it hurts. Rihanna, on her sprawling masterpiece “ANTI,” didn’t invent sublimity, but she gives it a crystalline form — she slides into the record booth with a lighter in hand and the world to burn at the glowing end of it. Her sublime happens in the smoke: it’s temporary, ashen, doomed, but she makes it look like it’ll last forever. On “ANTI,” her music is so propulsive it can shake people’s hearts out of their bodies, which, under her touch, feel at once perpetually and never their own. This album is her victory lap as sonic universe-probing and free-of-an-album-contract introspection, as disproving the trite machine of celebrity gossip by simply refusing to focus on it. It's not an album for rumors, it's one about time and its passage. Make no mistake: she’s unhurried, never uninterested. Be patient with Rihanna, and get a gold rush; “ANTI” is her holy grail.
Miyaki. Galliano. Givenchy. Fenty, too. Fashion for Rihanna has always been the science of desire, which is to say the science of longing. She’s at the top of that big-money game, her emancipatory album tour and cover wrapped in the same thing as her body: elegance, pyramids of cash, the maybe-blood of a deserving man meant for luxuriating within (a different kind of red carpet). “ANTI”’s project is to slow that crawl towards Rihanna and her mythos, to instead revel in that unfulfilled desire, to feel the cost of wanting or even sneaking a look toward her.
A roomful of stunts and buzzy rumors surrounded the release over four years, covering its hotly-anticipated debut in a chasm of fakeouts, second-guesses, and lacquered promos, notably nothing like the lush album at its end. On the heels of studio snippets, it came time for the haptic, slick, mansion-set Samsung teaser videos “ANTI diaRy,” the release of lead single “Work,” and then the full album leaked — deceptively anticlimactic.
Not a day later, it came out officially, and the rumors decrescendoed into a hush. It went platinum two days after its release, per the $25 million Samsung deal to shuffle out 1 million free copies on the JAY-Z-fronted streaming-service TIDAL. With this, it catapulted the year widely touted as the greatest hurrah for 2010s pop: a year of universal disaster and supposedly confessional, more “personal” albums for Beyoncé, Solange, Kanye West, Frank Ocean, Drake. But Rihanna, par for the course, arrived at the front of the line.
2016 was the year Rihanna laid claim to the cover, to the ballad, to the rock-song, to the dancehall hit, and let them fester and mix and flow. As the album has aged, it has taught audiences how to listen to it: to not waste time expecting classic pop but instead enter a meditation on the magic of showmanship.
“ANTI” is a magnet. It signals a destination of some undefined, neon-pulsed dance floor, probably huge and certainly loud, where everyday people can, with one twirl, simulate fashion models (on “Work” and “Needed Me”), be anointed in exclusive confessions (on “Higher”), and leap into the love they never expected was in the room all along (on “Love On The Brain” and “Never Ending”). In its variety, it’s more akin to a grandiose modern art show than an album: a premonition to the 2019 announcement that her home Barbados will honor her with a full museum. The moniker Rihanna Museum has a nice ring to it, no?
What is Rihanna against, exactly? “ANTI” what? Primarily, inhibition. Rihanna meditates on desire and insists on the exhaustion afforded by both love and celebrity (“must be love on the brain,” “could you please give my reflection a break?,” “Like so close, if they hurt you, you wouldn’t find out...”), and it’s clear how much of the content is collected heartbreak. Here, in the slower, experimental space of the album, Rihanna formulates the alternative: attract the thing that can change your life, give into it, see where it gets you.
The references at hand — Prince, Tame Impala, Florence Welch, Azealia Banks, even David Bowie — are easy. But to talk about Rihanna and “ANTI” is to open up room for Eartha Kitt. Yes, the firecracker of Kitt’s “Compromising? For what reason?” interview resonates on Rihanna’s frequency, but her album “That Bad Eartha” is the kind of sprawling piece inflected with mood, variability, and masterful coos into the microphone which allowed an album like “ANTI” to live. In their works, both women are positioned as champions, lonely-but-they-like-it provocateurs. They use loving lyrics to muse over how it feels when it’s gone, cover other artists’ music to ask, “What about me?”
“ANTI” comes in the form of the13-song original, and the sixteen-song deluxe. The deluxe album-closer “Sex With Me” is Rihanna’s pivot back into the electronicized, undeniable sexuality that she, at first glance upon the album, left at the door. What a revelation to end an album with a song that is ostensibly erotic while employing ‘80s synths and echoic vocal production to uncover the seduction, swoon at it, and then force a cry when it’s over. Listening to it, one can hear a match struck in a dark, private room, and its beat vibrates like bone conduction. It thrums. It drops low. “I know, I know, I make it hard to let go…” is the pinnacle line of 2016. She returns to herself, which is to say what audiences were prepared to expect, and, by the end of “Sex With Me,” leaves them in brutal wait. It felt so good, so agonizing, but now it’s over. By then, she’s just a mirage whose allure haunts and sparkles as she sneaks off with a wink and a laugh, knowing she was on her way out the whole time.
If this album is Rihanna’s last, that’s okay. Because after this, audiences are equipped to say and live what it is that they want, and regardless of her next destination, they’ll follow. Isn’t that the most joyous legacy an artist can aim for, anyway?

After almost seven years, it appears that the legendary marriage between Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, also known as Kimye, might be coming to a close. Following public disputes earlier last year, Kimye is allegedly discussing divorce, and one TikToker saw this as an opportunity.
On Jan. 5, a social media influencer named Ava Louise posted a TikTok where she alleged that Kanye West was having an affair with a prominent male makeup influencer. Though Louise did not specify the beauty guru she was referring to in her initial TikTok, she wasted no time in liking the comments that flooded the video speculating that the alleged affair was with millionaire makeup mogul and influencer Jeffree Star, all but confirming the theory. The fact that both Star and West owned property in the same region of Wyoming certainly didn’t dissuade speculators.
Historically, Jeffree Star revels in the opportunity to stoke drama in order to avoid more serious controversies. When directly questioned by another influencer about the alleged affair, he coyly responded “I’m having the best time in Wyoming.” Star also posted on social media tagging his location in Wyoming, captioned a photo “I’m ready for Sunday Service” (West’s weekly Christian gathering) and deleted old tweets that referred to West. He made sure not to immediately refute the claim.
Jeffree Star is no stranger to internet drama that leaks into mainstream news. Star has been accused on multiple occasions of blatant racism, organizing internet take-downs, and even sexual assault as of last year. In the wake of more recent racism allegations, Star featured several black men prominently in his videos, including romantic interests, which detractors speculated was an instance of performative anti-racism intended solely to shield him from further accusations of bigotry. Therefore, being romantically linked to Kanye West was likely an allegation he wouldn’t want to deny so soon.
Star eventually did deny the rumor in his video, “Addressing The Kanye Situation,” which explained away any lingering suspicions and cast extreme doubt on the validity of any of Louise’s statements. Louise is a self-proclaimed “clout-chaser” who was perhaps most famous for attempting to start a “challenge” of licking airplane toilet seats during the pandemic.
After Star dispelled the rumor, a friend of Louise took to TikTok to post an audio message where Louise claimed she made the entire story up for clicks, which Louise later confirmed herself. This entire situation should come as no surprise given she was previously a guest on Dr. Phil for her fame-hungry antics,and all of her TikTok videos revolve around vying for views and claiming her critics are simply jealous of her looks and success. If enough of her viewers had simply scrolled to her earlier content, this story likely would not have reached the heights that it did. Louise even went as far as to claim she was being sued by the Kardashian family — a claim that was immediately debunked by the aforementioned voice message and by Jenner’s representation, who responded that she had “zero clue who [Louise] is.”
TikTok has frequently been shown to spread mass disinformation, particularly in the case of the pandemic, which caused the removal of thousands of fraudulent videos and resulted in the “Be Informed” campaign to combat dangerous rumors. Despite the Star and West rumors being mostly harmless, they exemplify the wider issue of misinformation on TikTok.

On Jan. 15, Ariana Grande released her first track of the year, a remix of “34 + 35” from her sixth studio album “Positions” featuring Doja Cat and Megan Thee Stallion. In the remix, Doja Cat shows off her sultry word play, while Megan Thee Stallion delivers her signature flow. That being said, the “remix” of the overtly erotic song feels more like the addition of two features than anything else.
It’s clear that the only new material mixed into the original track was Doja and Megan’s verses. Both Doja and Megan have proved that they understand what it means to truly remix a track — evident in their highly popular remixes of “Say So” and “Savage” respectively — so it’s disappointing that they’d collaborate with Ariana on this project without rectifying this musical faux pas. The lack of authentic remixing in this release is bound to leave the listener dissatisfied.
Ariana serves a first verse, pre-chorus, and chorus before leaving the rest to Doja and Megan. Doja slides effortlessly into the track, managing to capture the essence of the song whilst preserving her identity as an artist. Doja’s musical versatility has come to define her career, making her an attractive candidate to be featured on any song. She matches Ariana’s cheeky energy and even throws shade at rapper 6ix9ine (“I want that six-nine without Tekashi”).
While Doja’s verse is fresh and enhances the song, Megan’s verse falls flat. Megan’s addition to the remix sounds, for lack of a better word, tired. With her wildly successful feature on Cardi B’s “WAP,” which included bars of an equally, if not more, suggestive nature, it’s almost impossible not to compare the two. It wouldn’t be far-fetched to imagine that Megan lifted a back-up verse from “WAP” and adapted it for the “34 + 35” remix. Regardless of this theory’s validity, Megan’s verse doesn’t seem to fit the track in the same way that Doja’s does. To make matters worse, Megan’s lyrics are rather uncompelling. She makes several references to YouTube (“Welcome to my channel, and today I'm 'bout to teach you somethin’,” “When I'm by myself, DIY like it's YouTube”), which aren’t particularly suited to be coupled with the song’s salacious content.
The bridge of “34 + 35” is one of the song’s most appealing sections, yet it was scrapped to make room for Doja and Megan’s verses in the remix. Even then, there still wasn’t enough room for both of these killer artists to meaningfully contribute to the track without it feeling crammed. One would hope that including the two of them in the remix wasn’t an uninspired ploy to boost “34 + 35”’s chart performance, but it’s pretty obvious that Ariana bit off more than she could chew in doing so. The track would have greatly benefited from only including a single additional artist, perhaps just Doja Cat, as opposed to two. Since it’s impossible to turn back time, it’s safe to say that “34 + 35” is superior in its original form.

Many who take pride in a music taste that avoids mainstream trends may want to shrug off Olivia Rodrigo’s “drivers license.” After giving the song a chance, however, listeners are likely to find themselves behind the wheel with tears streaming down their faces, belting out the lyrics.
Rodrigo made a name for herself with her 2020 hit “All I Want” from the “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series” soundtrack. And yet, the success of “All I Want” pales in comparison to that of “drivers license.” Her first single has skyrocketed through the charts, debuting at #1 on Billboard’s Hot 100 and breaking records across streaming platforms. Social media is overflowing with memes, covers, and versions of the song written from alternative points of view. All of this attention raises the question: What makes “drivers license” so special?
No conversation about “drivers license” would be complete without a summary of the drama that fueled its rise to fame. The single came after Rodrigo’s alleged breakup with her onscreen love interest Joshua Bassett. Signs point to Bassett as the subject of her heartbreak anthem, given that he taught her how to drive and has been involved in dating rumors with actress and singer Sabrina Carpenter, who speculation has deemed “that blonde girl” Rodrigo wrote about. To make matters more complicated, Bassett and Carpenter released singles of their own shortly afterward, seemingly in response to Rodrigo’s.
Instrumentally, “drivers license” isn’t anything that hasn’t been heard before, straightforward in a way that doesn’t distract from the hard-hitting lyrics, similar to Phoebe Bridgers and Lorde. The steady piano line and minimal percussion that accompany Rodrigo’s vocals are pared back for each verse, becoming slightly more robust in the chorus. When the bridge arrives after a brief moment of silence, glorious harmonies and a symphonic background erupt to create what is arguably Rodrigo’s most euphoric moment as she describes the nostalgic sights she passes by while driving. Here, she sings with a vulnerable tone of heartache, which highlights her anguished admission of unrequited love and carries through to the end of the composition. Anyone who’s tried to sing along will also recognize the impressive breadth of Rodrigo’s voice, gentle yet crystal clear in upper registers and powerful in a lower range.
Despite the song’s lack of instrumental originality, Rodrigo’s lyrics resonate in a way that few recently-released breakup songs have, her confessional songwriting following in the footsteps of Taylor Swift. Though describing her personal experience, the lyrics feel universal, brilliantly capturing the sadness that comes with watching an ex find new love. Struggling to escape the past, she sings, “I just can’t imagine how you could be so okay now that I’m gone,” presumably comparing herself to Sabrina Carpenter with the disheartening lyric, “She’s everything I’m insecure about.” Rodrigo also beautifully articulates the difficult resurfacing of old memories after a breakup when she sings, “I still hear your voice in the traffic, we’re laughing / Over all the noise.” Her vulnerable lyrics reflect the unique opportunity to release emotions without judgement that comes with driving solo.
Is this all just one big publicity stunt intended to boost the careers of those involved? Probably. Regardless, “drivers license” remains a pop triumph. Rodrigo turns the mundane act of driving into a heart wrenching, metaphorical drive through now bittersweet memories, her success well-earned after her experience became the perfect song for every breakup playlist.

In a deafening reality where noise begets more noise, it’s easy to characterize the act of listening as odd as opposed to necessary.
Modern music often seems preoccupied with asserting itself rather than reflecting on its creator — authentic vulnerability and thoughtfulness are rare commodities.
In his newest album, “Nobody Is Listening,” however, Zayn has done some serious tuning in. The singer has clearly exempted himself from the titular accusation, punctuating a majority of song lyrics with an acute interiority that proves more emotionally substantive than his prior releases. Most refreshing is that Zayn leans into himself for his own good, not for the sake of others.
Though his two previous studio albums possessed a magnetism of their own, “Nobody is Listening” also resists his previous tendency toward bombastic riffs and superficial talk. Despite its settled-down ambience, each song presents its own unapologetic rawness, in both the lyrical and emotional senses of the word.
The album further conveys interiority through its narrative direction. Though Zayn addresses many a line to an anonymous lover (e.g. “Something told me it was you”), he is actually trying to establish a candid dialogue with himself by conversing with a partner.
On “Calamity,” Zayn experiments with an alluring blend of mumble rap and crooning vocals, suggesting that his musical development has moved a lifetime away from the candy-colored pop of his bygone One Direction days. Unlike previous smash hits such as “PILLOWTALK,” many of the singer’s newest songs exude a low-key allure that affirms Zayn is neither self-conscious nor rushed to prove his authenticity. Furthermore, he chooses a composed, reflective voice over an overly emotional one, substantiating the emergence of a keener, more mature version of one of contemporary music’s more familiar names.
Although interiority is the heartbeat of the album’s lyrics, Zayn also identifies and honors the anguish that arises from surrendering to one’s most intimate thoughts. “My mind’s in a prism shape,” he muses in his first song, “And in times like prison state.” He recognizes that a dedication to oneself is neither romantic nor pleasurable, but rather a slow and often agonizing odyssey of practice.
Yet another of the album’s subversions is the songwriter’s questioning of love through his actions. Foregoing the typical rhetoric of being head over heels for the one and only, Zayn instead challenges listeners to reevaluate what true love means — and necessitates — for those who bear the brunt of it. On “Better,” he argues that even though he still very much cares for his partner, it is best to let the relationship go before things turn sour: “Why wait to hate?” he asks. “Can we save love?” In fact, the singer argues that it is precisely because they are still in love that they should leave each other altogether: “Cause, sometimes it’s better that way / Gotta let it go so your heart don’t break / Cause I love you.”
Few, if any, hard feelings surface in Zayn’s musicality. Even when he is telling his partner that they need to end their relationship, his voice contains no malice, just a tired foresight that verges on defeatist. “Two wrongs make no right,” he sings on “Outside.” “When it’s left, at least we tried.” Time and time again, the lyricist seeks to articulate the fragility and futility of his intimate relationships.
Perhaps the album’s most arresting song is “Unfuckwitable,” in which Zayn experiments with wordsmithing, from the track’s title down to its triumphant lyrics: “I’m unfuckwitable / In a world of my own.” Solitude transforms from a reason for despair to one for celebration: “Me is all I need to be inspired / My vibe and my life are all my design.” The unapologetically confident lyrics cooly express a fresh, urgent sense of personal agency condemning superficiality as both excessive and destructive: “So tired of fake friends and fake love, you know.”
The modern landscape has made blocking out the noise near impossible, but Zayn has made an admirable — though nowhere near perfect — attempt. In fact, in his pursuit of selfhood, the songwriter just may have succeeded in reinventing himself for the better.

In her 1989 book, “Toward a Feminist Theory of State” — which serves as a feminist analysis of inequality, politics, sexuality, and law — feminist legal scholar Catharine MacKinnon argues, among other things, that sexuality and eroticism (and gender) is determined by male desire and that what defines male sexual arousal is acts of dominance and force.
A review of Hollywood’s pervasive rape culture, brought to light by the #MeToo movement, is enough to corroborate MacKinnon’s argument.
Recently, actor Armie Hammer — known for his role in “Call Me By Your Name” and as both of the Winklevoss twins in “The Social Network” — has become the latest Hollywood actor to be at the center of a sexual abuse scandal, with a string of allegations citing his sexual abuse, violence, and manipulation.
The allegations broke out early last week when anonymous Instagram account @houseofeffie, a survivor herself, began to share screenshots of messages that Hammer allegedly sent to herself and various other women between 2016 and 2020. In one of these screenshots, the actor allegedly writes that he is “100 percent a cannibal.” Dozens more alleged screenshots, recordings, and testimonies of conversations with the actor have since been shared online.
Ex-partner Courtney Vucekovich also came out with her own allegations shortly afterwards in an interview with Page Six where she said Hammer would talk about breaking one of her ribs so he could “barbecue and eat it.”
“He kind of captivates you and while being charming, he’s grooming you for these things that are darker and heavier and consuming. When I say consuming, I mean mentally, physically, emotionally, financially, just everything,” she said. Adding later, “I wasn’t safe.” After the relationship ended, Vucekovich said she was hospitalized for PTSD and trauma.
Hammer has denied the claims based on the unverified screenshots as “bullshit” in a statement to Variety.
That the cannibalistic aspect of the allegations was given the most attention is no surprise: The initial shock of a Hollywood mainstay allegedly wanting to eat people’s toes presents an absurdity that’s difficult to ignore. But to ignore the numerous other allegations of violence outside of cannibalism is to set the stage for yet another attractive white man to get away with alleged abuse, especially as more women continue to come out with allegations against the actor.
In the case of the Hammer allegations and the media flurry surrounding them, the stories of the women who came forward were treated more as vehicles for sensationalist headlines about Hammer’s alleged kinks than as allegations of trauma and abuse at the hands of Hammer.
In an interview with DailyMailTV, model Paige Lorenze spoke of her own experience dating Hammer for four months in late 2020. She detailed how Hammer would allegedly bite her and drink her blood whenever she had a cut — and how he used a knife to carve the letter “A” into her skin as a brand.
“His actions and behavior are dangerous and emotionally and psychologically damaging. He is saying people are kink shaming him and should not comment on his sex life, but BDSM is a smoke screen for him wanting to hurt women,” she said. “You can be just as traumatized by consensual sex. It’s unacceptable that he coerces women into agreeing to let him hurt them.”
Indeed, the conversation about Hammer has largely failed to pay attention to the toxic and long-theorized conceptions of male sexuality that the allegations against him illuminate (whether they’re true or not).
In “Toward a Feminist Theory of State,” MacKinnon writes, “the male sexual role... centers on aggressive intrusion on those with less power. Such acts of dominance are experienced as sexually arousing, as sex itself.”
In other words, male eroticism is largely driven by violence; “aggressive intrusions” on women (who, in our society, are those with less power) are sex itself as defined by male sexuality.
The fantasies Hammer allegedly held — and, at times, acted upon — are inherently and explicitly violent, if nothing else. The screenshotted messages detail rape, graphic cannibalism, blood-sucking, cutting, and other extreme and explicit fantasies in which Hammer would assert his “ownership” of his partners. Other screenshots allegedly involve Hammer and a woman talking about how she wanted him to stop whatever he was doing and he didn’t, to the point that she “tried to crawl away and cried hysterically.”
According to Lorenze, Hammer would write these violent fantasies off as representative of the BDSM community. But while BDSM (a condensed acronym for bondage and discipline, dominance and submission, and sadism and masochism) and rough sex are valid when coming from a place of mutual care and respect, to claim that cannibalistic and rape-focused fantasies are simply “rough sex” is to cover for gender violence.
It’s no secret that American society in recent years — with the popularization of cultural phenomena like “Fifty Shades of Grey,” for example — has, indeed, gradually become more accepting of previously stigmatized aspects of sexuality, like kink and BDSM. Of course, this isn’t at all a bad thing. But too often, the popular conception of kink and BDSM is used not as a step towards mutual sexual liberation but as a thin veil to obscure sexual violence and abuse as a show of dominance, especially by men against women.
Take, again, the example of “Fifty Shades of Grey,” where billionaire businessman Christian Grey’s relationship with student Anastasia Steele, while written to be emblematic of BDSM, is instead deeply abusive. In one scene, when Steele threatens to leave, he threatens her back, citing that he knows her address. Her inner monologue immediately goes to the way he could beat her “seven shades.”
While the book trilogy introduced millions of Americans to non-normative sex, it did so under the misguided pretext that what determines male sexual arousal is violence. Steele doesn’t want to be Grey’s submissive, but Grey is only turned on by that and violent sex.
Speaking about her relationship with Hammer, Lorenze said, “I was his Christian Grey fantasy.”
Like Grey, Hammer is alleged to have coerced and manipulated his partners into being the targets of violent acts for the sake of his sexual arousal. Lorenze, for example, detailed that she would often be coerced into sex acts that she wasn’t comfortable with.
“Any man who is fantasizing about crushing bones, eating them, having sex with female limp bodies is a danger to all women,” Lorenze said in an interview.
Even in consensual, “vanilla” sexual relationships, sex can be violent to the point of trauma because of the very power imbalances that exist between men and women in and outside of the bedroom. And because women are socialized to subscribe to the male conception of sex and eroticism, domination and aggression are often wrongly accepted as normal conventions of sex at the expense of women. Bring in explicitly violent acts and desires like rape and cannibalism, however, and it becomes inarguably clear that domination and violence is the driving force behind too much of abusive male sexual desire — as MacKinnon argues.
The question of what society can do to address the violence of alleged abusers like Hammer is contested. Lorenze, for example, believes Hammer can be helped through therapy. The account owner of @houseofeffie, on the other hand, believes that to change him would be impossible. Regardless of Hammer’s capacity for change, however, the need to build justice for survivors is clear. That is not done by ignoring, cherry picking, or spectacularizing the experiences of survivors like the women who have come out against Hammer, but through centering the voice and agency of survivors, treating them with dignity, ensuring consequences for the abuser, and preventing further harm.
The Hammer allegations are not notable merely for their shocking nature nor should they be treated as such. Instead, they should be seen as what they are: the experiences of survivors, as well as an amplification of the way all kinds of sexual violence are too often excused and written away at the expense of its targets, especially women.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Jan. 19, Vogue announced Vice President Kamala Harris as its February 2021 Cover Star. With this announcement, the iconic fashion and lifestyle magazine released the photographs of Vice President Harris that would be used for the digital and print editions of the issue. The images sparked intense backlash on social media, primarily from those who weren’t impressed with the way the Vice President was styled for the cover of the print edition. Although discourse on Vogue covers may seem frivolous to those outside of the world of fashion, the controversy surrounding the February issue warrants an examination of its implications.
While the digital edition features Vice President Harris in a perfectly tailored powder blue suit from the Michael Kors Collection, the Vice President is dressed much more casually in the print cover, styled in a black Donald Deal blazer paired with black denim and Converse sneakers. If you were to ask anyone which version appears more becoming, they would almost certainly say the digital edition. Despite the obvious attention to detail in referencing Alpha Kappa Alpha — Vice President Kamala Harris’s Howard University sorority — in the photograph’s color palette, the print cover doesn’t live up to Vogue’s fashion-forward reputation. The approach to the print cover seems lackluster, even, harkening back to pedestrian renditions of the magazine in the “#VogueChallenge” that swept social media last summer.
Recreating the February cover would be as easy as plucking the Vice President up from any time during her 2020 campaign trail and having her pose in front of a makeshift backdrop. For many, however, that’s the issue. They believe that the public shouldn’t feel overly comfortable with the Vice President, as comfort begets disrespect. To an extent, they are correct. Presenting the first African American and Asian American woman to hold the vice presidency in such a casual manner. One could argue it might lead to United States citizens not taking her seriously, something made a bigger challenge by her status as the first female Vice President.
At the same time, Vice President Kamala Harris’ styling on the cover is authentic to her. As shown in her relatively casual campaign attire, she herself wants to be perceived as down-to-earth and relatable. If the Vice President had dressed in tweed Chanel ensembles during her campaign, Vogue likely would have styled her in just that on the print cover.
Notably, the digital and print covers were both shot by Tyler Mitchell, a Black photographer who made history as the first African American to shoot a Vogue cover when he photographed Beyonce for the September 2018 issue, so it is unlikely that the artistic choices resulted from ill will on the part of the team at Vogue. Nonetheless, hopefully Vogue’s offer to provide print copies of the Vice President’s digital cover will quell those who are unhappy with the print cover.
The fact that Vogue chose to put the Vice President on the cover of its February issue is itself unprecedented, as the First Lady is typically selected for this role. Vice President Kamala Harris was presumably chosen due to the historic nature of her election as the first female Vice President, but to expect the highest level of fashion from a woman in her position presents a problematic double standard. No one paid much attention to the wardrobe of male Vice President in the past, and this should not change for Vice President Kamala Harris just because she is a woman. What’s more important is that she fulfills her role in leading the country without being subjected to antiquated female stereotypes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The year is 1927, and blues legend Ma Rainey has just arrived in Chicago to record her latest album, accompanied by her Georgia Jazz Band. Outside in the midsummer heat, temperatures are rising. Inside the studio, fierce ambitions and disparate passions mean that tempers are heating up as well.
Directed by acclaimed playwright George C. Wolfe and written by Ruben Santiago-Hudson, “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” is based on August Wilson’s 1982 play of the same name. The film stars Viola Davis as the spirited ‘Mother of the Blues’ and the late Chadwick Boseman as Levee Green, Ma’s talented but overconfident trumpeter. The film is dedicated to Boseman, who passed away in 2020; his affecting portrayal of Levee is his final film appearance.
Like its source material, the film’s focus is precise and its narrative time frame narrow, taking place over the course of a single afternoon. Nevertheless, its in-depth exploration of one fateful recording session reveals a plethora of plain truths about racism and systemic oppression in America that remain resonant to this day.
From its very first scene, the film makes it palpable that Ma Rainey’s immense talent and captivating stage presence has had an indelible influence on the Blues genre — and music in general. Indeed, the film’s opening scene illustrates Ma’s growing success and preeminence through a lively and soulful performance of “Deep Moaning Blues” that is split between two locations: a down-to-earth venue in Barnesville, Georgia and a large, glamorous venue in the north. “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” takes place in the midst of the Great Migration, during which millions of Black Americans moved from the rural south to northern cities in search of employment and economic prospects. But as many would soon realize, the north was not the land of opportunity that white employers would have Black communities believe. The industries and structures underpinning northern urban epicenters were — and still are — just as fraught with systemic racism as their southern counterparts. “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” shows us that the music industry is no exception.
Following the film’s gorgeous opening sequence, band members Levee (Boseman), Toledo (Glynn Turman), Cutler (Coleman Domingo), and Slow Drag (Michael Potts) begin rehearsing in a Chicago studio. As the band plays and riffs together, Wolfe subtly reveals existing tensions within the group: We learn that the highly ambitious Levee seeks to secure a record deal and start a band of his own, a scheme that the rest of the band disapproves of. Ma shortly arrives late to the studio, much to the frustration of her dismissive white producers, including her manager Irvin (Jeremy Shamos), who repeatedly seek to alter or rush her creative process. Ma, however, remains bold and unapologetic in her advocacy for herself and her band.
Santiago-Hudson’s script is insightful and beautifully layered as the film explores the many manifestations of racism in the music industry and exposes producers’ manipulative goals. The film impressively balances each of its characters, particularly as numerous personal and professional disagreements begin to emerge among members of the band. Levee and company were not real people — but they certainly feel like it. Indeed, even the band members with the fewest lines feel honest and fleshed out: Santiago-Hudson thoughtfully examines each character’s individual experiences with the music industry’s exploitation of Black brilliance.
While the film's impressive costume design, makeup, and lighting (at times warm, at times theatrical) notably contribute to the film’s stylish visual intrigue, it is the film’s stellar cast and powerhouse performances that are perhaps most outstanding. Unsurprisingly, Viola Davis dazzles as the brazen and fiery Ma Rainey, an inspiring example of a Black woman who revels in her own artistry and unapologetically demands the treatment she deserves from an industry that seeks only to profit from her talents. At one point, she tells Cutler, “All they want is my voice. Well, I done learned that. And they gonna treat me the way I want to be treated no matter how much it hurt ‘em.” In Davis’ hands, Ma Rainey is also a delightful performer: The actress is a joy to watch in the film’s musical scenes, each a delightfully vibrant celebration of Blues in its own right.
Boseman’s performance is similarly stunning. Boseman channels his immense talent into exploring the nuances of Levee’s drive, distress, and, ultimately, his doomed sense of hope. The emotional impact of Levee’s impassioned soliloquies is further deepened by cinematographer Tobias A. Schlisseler’s strategic use of long takes and slow zooms focused on Boseman. These techniques allow audiences to plainly feel Levee’s frustration and desperation, even through the film’s dramatic conclusion.
Ultimately, “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom”’s captivating visuals, radiant performances, and celebration of the Blues in its music and sound design make for an affecting meditation on Black art and racism in the entertainment industry that unfortunately feels as timely as ever.

When sex and death are often coupled up in film; they clash and burn, usually ending in kicking-and-screaming terror. Director Lawrence Michael Levine knows this, and his film “Black Bear,” now available on VOD, sets up erotic sequences which spiral into extended, dizzying vignettes focused less on these disarming acts than the conditions in artistic communities which allow them to occur. In Levine’s film, putting these elements into art makes real emotional tensions gnarlier, scarier, and unrelentingly ambiguous.
This near-horror film starts like they always do: In the woods, two white people meet, flirt, and begin to plume their tortured psychological depths in a secluded house where no one tells much truth until it comes time to drink, bicker, and kill. Audiences might think they know the jig here. But the film snares those expectations into a trap by twisting the haunted-house formula into a piece patterned with Tennessee Williams-esque unhappy couples, surrealist tension over gender, and a twist which shifts the film into a meditation about the extractive mechanisms by which indie movies can be made — to say nothing of Hollywood.
The scene: Allison (Aubrey Plaza), an enigmatic film director, visits Gabe (Christopher Abbott) and Blair (Sarah Gadon)’s lake house, and over one hypnotic night, they debate the meaning of film, death, and women’s autonomy. Wine is poured, blood shed, and a black bear emerges.
The film marks “part one” and “part two” through onscreen title cards, and watching part one is akin to getting your funny bone pricked until it tingles. Sound design here serves uncanny ends: The dialogue mix is close to the audience at all times, no matter what distance actors have from the screen or each other. It’s subtle, but it forces the realization that all are trapped inside this austere echo-chamber. Cinematographer Robert Leitzell’s exacting close-ups and handheld tracking shots give the towering house its size, which, thanks to Tracy Dishman’s minimalist production design, seems to enlarge in depth as tension festers.
In part two, where the characters are revealed to be on a film set, Levine’s script and Matthew L. Weiss’ editing drops audiences into gut-level déjà vu. Now Allison is the actress, Gabe is the director and tortured husband, while Blair is the co-lead. Gabe and Allison have spent their entire fortune on this film, and Allison is in a rut as they rush to finish. The focus turns to the final night of filming this movie, which is a tilted version of the events of part one. It is hard to track what is exactly happening on this set: everybody's personalities overlap while inexplicable images (smashing coffee cups, for one) jolt and recur to further dislocate the viewer. As Allison’s emotional worries increase, the film gets more abstract: akin to dream logic, the two halves of the film blur into an ambiguity that can be felt, not explained.
Plaza anchors the whole thing through a performance so intricately wound and fiery it could shatter a glass. Her comedy is smartly restrained; in other projects, she pries deep into wry, dark humor, but the claustrophobic script mostly denies her this strategy.
“How can you make something if you never think about it?” Blair asks Allison in the first half. The women’s performances are brilliant exactly because they blur the line between feeling and thought. Gadon is on full, high-strung display; the pregnant Blair’s impulse refilling of red wine is macabre, and her second-act plan, pretending to have an affair with Gabe to hike up Allison’s onscreen performance, is as brainy as it is diabolical. Their acting asserts how women onscreen navigate both the camera and the violent male gaze while the gap between them coalesces into an unwinnable game. Given this thematic richness, the film would’ve benefitted from a scene, however subtle, where Allison and Blair go at it alone.
There are always racial politics running through a room of white people screaming at one another. In the film’s second half, the crewmembers of color all either get high or console the erratic white actors. While this might be read as racist, it signifies how they survive inside these swirling, tense atmospheres; their labor literally makes the white onscreen melodrama possible. Either way, Allison’s drunken sexual pursuit of Baako, one of few Black crew members, is deeply alarming and the level of potential violations runs high, until the film pulls back, mercifully lets him escape, and lets her go wild all by herself.
There is no formal climax after Allison, in a bravura monologue, collapses to the floor in front of the crew. After a few more unsettling moments, the sensuality and violence are turned up to the most extreme, but never fully explode as in other haunted-house flicks. This proves the film’s mission: Wasn’t the tension enough? Bloody catharsis after such wrenching emotional pain seems, well, gratuitous. The lack of an immediate answer, and Allison’s final, self-aware stare at the camera, remains exactly, devastatingly, the point.

English director Phyllidia Lloyd has long been known for her ambitious works which focus on women, and for her practice of bringing in female collaborators to help her. From the all-female crews that helped run her opera productions in the ‘90s to the female producer, writer, and stars that lent their talents to her 2008 feature film debut “Mamma Mia,” Lloyd’s best work is often buoyed and characterized by strong women.
In her latest directorial project, “Herself,” Lloyd presents a heart-wrenching tribute to relationships between women with intimate flair and candid performances. Lloyd highlights how strong female relationships are at the foundation of any woman’s struggle for success.
With a screenplay written by Malcolm Campbell and Irish actress Clare Dunne, the film follows Sandra (also played by Dunne), a young mother who fights to escape from an abusive relationship, along with her two younger daughters Emma (Ruby Rose O’Hara) and Molly (Molly McCann). Limited by Dublin’s broken housing system, Sandra sets off to build a house by herself while being effectively homeless, working multiple jobs, and being a full-time mother. Her big break comes when one of her employers, Dr. Peggy O’Toole (Harriet Walter), offers to grant her a plot of land in her garden and a loan for building supplies — allowing Sandra to begin what promises to be her final struggle before attaining freedom from her abusive ex, Gary (Ian Lloyd Anderson). Critically, she does so surrounded and aided by several female figures including a co-worker and a fellow mom from her daughters’ school.
At its core, the drama is a powerful exploration of the relationships that shape motherhood. Throughout "Herself," Sandra is driven by the love for her daughters and her desperation to give them a better life. While Dunne’s performance is moving throughout, it is O’Hara and McCann that provide a soft heart and playfulness to the film’s otherwise serious premise. While Sandra faces severe abuse from Gary, a fate only amplified by her financial instability, her daughters dependably bring the story back to its heart: the bond between a mother and her children. When things are going particularly badly for Sandra — whether it be run-ins with her ex or a social worker — Emma and Molly’s innocent questions about life and optimism about their future break up the drama with tender, heartwarming moments.
Lloyd’s directorial talent shines brightest when the film reverts to its powerful themes of motherhood and womanhood. Lloyd's prior experiences as a theater director — where the story is rooted in acting and staging — are evident in the honest performances she gets from her actors. When Sandra finds herself at risk of losing her daughters in court, she shares an intimately heartbreaking moment with Peggy in the courtroom bathroom. The two actresses lean on their theater experience to take the tiny space and fill it with emotion, a feat no doubt facilitated by Lloyd’s directorial expertise.
Lloyd’s theater background is also evident in her use of music. At the film’s opening, Sia’s “Chandelier” provides the perfect (if ironic) anthem of freedom for the trapped Sandra as she and her daughters dance to it in the kitchen moments before Gary attacks. And by the end, Lloyd plays “Mother” by Irish singer-songwriter LYRA — itself an unabashed tribute to motherhood as LYRA sings of rising above with her mother’s guidance.
Crucially, as is important in any film about abuse, “Herself” refuses to gloss over its dark reality. Neither Lloyd nor the film’s screenwriters fall into the dangerous trap of romanticizing abuse or the abuser. Lloyd instead chooses to highlight Sandra and her experiences, depicting her trauma through restless flashbacks.
Despite what the film’s title may lead one to believe, Sandra is many things, but rarely is she ever by "Herself." The relationships that Lloyd, Campbell, and Dunne spend so much time crafting demonstrates that magnificently, whether it is Sandra's daughters, or Peggy, there is a community that comes out to rally behind her.

“WandaVision,” which premiered on Jan. 15 and marked the first major release for Phase Four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, is an extraordinary start to Marvel’s 2021 line-up. The show centers on superheroes Wanda Maximoff a.k.a. Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany) post-“Avengers: Endgame,” as Wanda and Vision seemingly find themselves living in a ‘50s sitcom. The dynamic duo moves into the suburbs of Westview, trying to conceal their powers and peculiarities amongst their apparently normal neighbors. However, not all is as it appears, and the pair’s idyllic fantasy begins to crumble.
From the beginning, “WandaVision” perfectly balances entertainment with substance. The premiere absolutely commits to the aesthetics and form of a ‘50s sitcom, down to the finest details of setting and costume. Even the editing techniques and effects give a nod to an earlier time and create a carefully crafted atmosphere. Marvel’s signature comedic wit is perfectly adapted to the situational comedy style, translating to laugh-out-loud funny moments throughout. This intense dedication to worldbuilding works to create a completely unexpected dissonance when, throughout the show, Wanda and Vision experience moments of oddity and horror in their otherwise picturesque domestic life. This vague and unsettling uncertainty is pushed to the next level when, at the end of the episode, the entire show is revealed to be a television show within a television show: Viewers have been watching “WandaVision” through the television of someone within the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Fans of both the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the original comics will find plenty of Easter eggs throughout this premiere. Wanda uses transmutation (the power to reshape the molecular structure of any form of matter) in a comedic moment where she is trying to cook a chicken. Wanda first overcooks it, saying, “Oh no, too much!”, and then tries to undo the action, accidentally turning it into a basket of eggs while crying “Oh, no, not enough!”, concerned more about ruining dinner than discovering powers she has never used before. This episode even came with its own mid-premiere commercial, filled with more nods to the Marvel universe. The ad showed off a Stark Industries toaster, which makes Iron Man’s armor’s activation sound as it toasts bread. It also refers to the fact that Vision is both made by Tony Stark and frequently referred to as a toaster in both comics and fan culture.
While Wanda and Vision have been major characters in the comics, they have been mainly supporting characters within the realm of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Olsen and Bettany reprise their widely beloved roles with talent and commitment that really sells the unusualness of the show, especially considering how unique and layered “WandaVision” is in regards to other works in the Marvel franchise. The stellar acting is another example of the wonderful balance this premiere presents when combining the universe fans know and love with something completely original and mind-bending.
“WandaVision,” on its surface a witty and frivolous sitcom about two superheroes trying their hand at living in suburbia, is filled with complexities, raising question after question about how this show fits into the overarching narrative of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. How is Vision in the picture considering his tragic death during “Avengers: Infinity War?” Are these events figments of Wanda’s imagination? How does this show exist as a show within the world of the Marvel franchise, and how important are the names listed in the fake credits sequence after the final reveal from the premiere? This premiere leaves viewers on the edge of their seats, eager to solve these mysteries and more. Episode one of “WandaVision” not only garners excitement for the rest of this miniseries, but for the slew of Marvel shows coming out in the near future. Marvel is pushing the boundaries of what fans know and expect, and “WandaVision” is shaping up to be a series well worth following.

Sound healing practitioner, meditation teacher, and artist Lavender Suarez released her debut wellness book, “Transcendent Waves: How Listening Shapes Our Creative Lives,” on Dec. 15, 2020. The book is pensive, informative, and filled with color; Its intricate artwork is illustrated by Alex Tults and inspired by old science textbooks of the 1970s and ‘80s. The Harvard Crimson spoke with Suarez about finding sound healing, her inspirations and intentions with her book, the importance of intentional listening, and how we can adjust to our homes in quarantine.
The Harvard Crimson: In the section “Silent Distraction,” you mentioned how you started your practice at a Buddhist temple, and a monk told you to focus on your breath instead of on listening. How did you realize what the difference between that was, and what, since then, has influenced your work?
Lavender Suarez: The monk was saying — he didn't say listen to anything. All he said was just focus on your breath. And at that time, that wasn't enough guidance for me. You know, the idea of “focus on your breath,“it was like, well, does that mean think about your breath, does that mean listen to it? Should I be counting how long my breaths are? It just felt a bit vague. And then for the silent meditation, we also would sit on the floor, cross-legged, which, if you're not used to doing that, can actually feel quite uncomfortable after a while, so when I was first trying to get into meditation I was actually very uncomfortable, and my mind was racing, and I needed more guidance at that time.
So, when I started becoming more involved with sound healing, I realized that sound could be my guide, and I could then listen into the sound, I could hear how sound moved in the room, and if I was feeling distracted, I would just listen to the sound. And this was at home, me doing sound healing just for myself. I got really interested in playing instruments like singing bowls and gongs, and I think also doing a little bit of subtle movement while meditating felt really great for me, too. In the book, I talk about how I have led walking meditations, and something about the sensation of moving and meditating at the same time — I find it very calming, and it helps me connect with the mind and body much better than just sitting in silence.
THC: How long did that process take, finding guidance through sound and movement?
LS: It took a couple years. You know, I think everyone wants to attend to themselves and take care of themselves, and it takes a certain amount of courage to keep going, even when you feel like you fail at first, and to find what works best for you and to tap into what your interests are. So I've been a lifelong musician. I realized, “wait, there's meditations with music as well,” — which is an ancient, historical way to meditate, but at the time when I was researching meditation, everything just said, “just silent;” you just need silence. So it took a while of researching and looking into things and trying different kinds of yoga and all this different stuff to figure out what worked best for me. So, I understand deeply that that can be a difficult process for people, you know, they try one thing and, “oh, it didn't work for me, I just can't meditate.” So it's been great writing this book now, I wanted to share that trajectory with people — that initially, I thought it wasn't for me, and now it's become my whole life.
THC: The section on memory goes into how we remember sounds, or don’t, and how we can access that. Can you speak a bit to how sound can do that differently compared to other mediums of remembering?
LS: I love the neuroscience of listening and sound, and I love Oliver Sacks’s books about listening and music in our lives. I'll note as well I consulted with three neuroscientists on this book to make sure that the information I was presenting was correct. Music, in particular, is so powerful — the memories it creates in our minds. Sometimes when we see things, there's more of a pause because our eyes absorb information differently than our ears. There's a slight delay; our ears absorb information quicker than our eyes. And I think [that’s] so important because that goes into essentially who we are as primal beings. Our listening is our main defense system that we have in our body. Sometimes people like to talk about scent being the strongest sense that we have, but when you think about it, if you're walking down the street and there's a scary dog, you're not going to smell that dog, you’re going to hear that dog. And that's going to create a visceral sensation in your body. So, I love talking about how our ears are always there to protect us, and they're always searching for information, they're always gathering. We can close our eyes, but we can't close our ears.
THC: And does that apply to nonverbal sounds only or speech as well?
LS: All forms, because there's a big part in the book about communication. Listening skills aren't really formally taught most of the time; they’re something that we learn about in childhood. But even then, it can have sort of this framework of ‘listen to your parents, listen to your teachers,’ and that's never really fully explained. Everyone understands the concept of listening, but I like to explain [that] it's a lifelong process of development. And when you are listening more to the world around you, it also filters into your personal relationships. I also talk about inner listening, listening to yourself, creating a sense of self, [which goes back] to concepts of mindfulness and inspiration. So I feel like listening is such a beautiful, broad category that can go incredibly internal to completely external.
THC: The book was described as a medium for creativity and unlocking internal creative sparks. And I was wondering if the process of writing the book helped you as well as a musician, or did writing the book give you that clarity in unlocking that creative spark as well?
LS: This book came out of many years of teaching workshops, about sound in many different capacities. I've worked with people of all ages, from students as young as eight years old, up to elderly people. And I really wanted to put a little bit of all the information from all the lectures and workshops that I've done into one sort of starter book — an introduction to all these topics. So, I had just such a lovely time revisiting all those old workshops and remembering feedback that I received from students, questions that they had, topics that were really, of, of great interest, things that people wanted to learn about more; whenever I've done workshops about acoustic ecology and noise pollution people are just always really interested because they're topics that everyone knows a little bit about, people are familiar with the concept of noise pollution now. But in the same way that we're not taught how to develop our listening we're not really taught how to deal with noise pollution. The idea is just always “well, you just got to deal with it,” you know, it’s not very helpful, so I would teach workshops about, you know, changing our relationship to it. And then in the book I also talk about my concept of a sonic sanctuary, a place that you can go to that can feed you the sort of sonic palette that you need at that time, and about creating a relationship to place, and listening.
THC: How can we bring those practices into what’s been happening this year, especially in quarantine?
LS: With quarantine procedures, many of us are experiencing our homes in a way that we may not have had a chance to before. Maybe our homes were more of this place of transition, [but] now our home has to be everything for us — it has to be the library, it has to be the restaurant, it has to be where we sleep, it has to be our movie theater, it has to be all these things. So I was thinking about that when writing the book. Even within your own home, there’s different sonic palettes that come up — your instinct may be to set up your desk in your bedroom, but if you have a small table in the living room that has less street traffic noise or, you know, doesn't have other distracting sounds like radiators or air conditioners or whatever, [that might be better]. So even within your own home, there's so many different sounds that can come up and can create relaxation or disturbance.
I also talk about [how] sometimes we just need great music, and, you know, thinking about what's creating a personal playlist of music that you can listen to [like] when you otherwise can't really shut out the outside world and you just want to get your stuff done. Music can be incredibly motivating and I think it would have been unfair to completely ignore it in the book — that you know a lot of people get great work done while listening to music or podcasts, you know, audio books, all those kind of things. So, in the same way that artists need to have their tools ready, we need to have that ‘get-work-done’ playlist ready so that we don't go down the rabbit hole searching for the perfect podcast; we need to build that sort of personal archive up so that it's ready to go when we need it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For a show about Regency-era bachelorettes vying for a husband, Netflix’s “Bridgerton” doesn’t seem to have much to say about the institution of marriage. In fact, there are only two attitudes towards marriage expressed by “Bridgerton”’s women. The first is the one espoused by the majority of the female characters, including the show’s lead Daphne Bridgerton (Phoebe Dyvenor.) Daphne recognizes the economic and social importance of marriage, but mostly she wants love — and even more than love, she wants domesticity. Daphne spends the show dreaming of being a wife, and her main conflict in the second half of the series is driven by her desperation to become a mother. Daphne, together with other characters like Penelope Featherington, Marina Thompson, and more, recognize that there are some men who are sexist, but only to the extent that those men would make bad husbands. Mostly, they remain committed to their search for matrimony, focusing their lives around the pursuit of an engagement based on mutual love and respect.
The only female character who deviates from this attitude is Eloise Bridgerton (Claudia Jessie), Daphne’s younger sister. Eloise is completely uninterested in a domestic life or “the marriage mart,” as the series of balls and social events the characters attend is referred to. Throughout the series she passionately shares her desire to travel the world and write. She also frequently serves as the voice of feminism of the show, routinely cutting into scenes to denounce the patriarchy, almost as though she serves as an insert for “Bridgerton”’s modern audience. While Eloise’s position as the feminist character on the show has won her wide approval from fans, “Bridgerton”’s depiction of Eloise and her relationship to marriage has problematic implications.
There is certainly nothing wrong with a character not being interested in marriage or heterosexual relationships. In fact, with her character, “Bridgerton” had the opportunity to cover interesting ground, perhaps by committing to a portrayal of Eloise as queer, asexual, or aromantic, all of which could have been thought-provoking to explore in the show’s conservative regency setting. However, the first season does not even hint at any of these conclusions and, assuming that the show continues to follow the books, neither will forthcoming ones. Instead, by framing Eloise as the show’s resident empowered woman and the only female with goals outside of matrimony, the show chalks up her disinterest in romantic relationships simply to her being ambitious and feminist. It is here where “Bridgerton”’s portrayal of Eloise becomes damaging.
A small part of this problem lies in the fact that Eloise’s particular take on feminism is deeply condescending to other women who do participate in the “marriage mart.” Throughout the first season, she implies her sister and other girls who wish to marry are unaccomplished, unintelligent, and living dull, unworthy lives. In short, Eloise is “not like other girls,” and to have the most progressive voice in the show be so mean and dismissive is deeply frustrating.
However, Eloise’s propensity to dismiss other women is forgivable. The character is 17, and portrayed as having a limited understanding of the world in general (an entire episode is dedicated to her not knowing where babies come from). Furthermore, even as Eloise dismisses women who want matrimony, the show presents the domestically-focused Daphne in such a glamorous light that it would be misguided to suggest that the show is anti-marriage, even as it creates an association between feminism and a desire for spinsterhood.
No, the portrayal of women in “Bridgerton” is not damaging to viewers who are sure they want a domestic life or even those who are sure they don’t. Instead, by having Eloise be the only woman with divergent views of matrimony, “Bridgerton” creates a false dichotomy where every female character is either completely obsessed with domesticity or completely uninterested, with no room in between.
To better understand how “Bridgerton” fails in this regard it is worth comparing Eloise to a similar, if better executed, character — Jo March from the 2019 adaptation of “Little Women.” Jo is similar to Eloise in many ways. She is ambitious, a writer, and passionate about women’s place in the world. Like Eloise, she lives in a society where marriage is the main tool women have for upward mobility, and she knows that marriage is not the right path for her. But “Little Women,” unlike “Bridgerton,” shows that Jo struggles with this decision, not because she wants a married life (she does not) but because living in a society where there are such clear expectations for how women should live their lives causes internal conflict, as well as external. “The patriarchy” is not some outside force that feminists struggle against, but a series of assumptions and beliefs that are internalized by people of all genders.
The viewers of “Bridgerton” do not live in the Regency period, but in modern society women are still expected to make difficult decisions between prioritizing family or their career. If “Bridgerton” wants to be progressive and feminist, it is not enough to just insert a character who thinks marriage is stupid. Women in the real world have incredibly complicated and diverse relationships to marriage, to domesticity, and to the prospect of having children. Viewers deserve to see the complexity of these emotions represented on screen, rather than be presented with stories that make these different life paths seem predestined — where women are either romantic or ambitious by nature and never the two shall meet.
Hopefully, for Eloise’s sake, future seasons of the show will see her remain steadfast in her path — never internalizing societal messages about romance and never finding herself conflicted, unsure whether she really wants something or has just been told that she does. Eloise deserves nothing less — but as for the viewers, we deserve more.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a mild summer day in 1947, U.S. Secretary of State George C. Marshall outlined on the Memorial Church steps what would come to define his legacy: a plan to rebuild a European continent scarred by World War II. Speaking to a commencement crowd packed into Harvard Yard, the general-turned-statesman dispensed with any lingering vestiges of American isolationism to establish a new, post-war normal that endures to the present day.
Almost 75 years later, we face another episode of shared human misery that demands an equally seismic shift in collective thinking — a new normal of our own. Economic inequalities, political differences, and a public skeptical of scientific truths fueled a pandemic that still ravages every corner of the world. While a vaccine may halt Covid-19's spread, the antidote to the injustices it illuminated cannot be delivered through the tip of a needle.
Many of these persistent social ills result from a lack of accountability in both the public and private sector. While an incompetent government response allowed Covid-19 to spread, corporations like Amazon and Instacart subjected workers to unsafe conditions during the pandemic’s tumultuous early months. Unaccountable police departments allow officers to kill people of color with near impunity while private banks reinforce racial caste systems through discriminatory lending practices. In a fraught political system carved up between the public and private spheres, responsibility for defending the common good cannot be reserved entirely to the former. We, as both consumers and citizens, must expect the private sector to shoulder some of the burden.
Harvard University is one private actor that can certainly embrace a greater responsibility for the broader welfare. While institutions like Harvard are right to primarily focus on the people that comprise its community, they cannot be blind to the power afforded by reputation, wealth, or intellectual status. Since Harvard’s power exists, we as members of the community should expect the University to wield it with an awareness of the public good — starting by taking better care of its workers in an ongoing pandemic and encouraging peer institutions to do the same.
But Harvard as an institution is perhaps not the most important player in the emerging system of shared responsibility. Many of the most powerful companies — from Google to Goldman Sachs — employ a steady stream of Harvard alumni to fuel their corporate engines.
Six in 10 2020 graduates planned to enter jobs in either consulting, finance, or technology, according to a Crimson survey. Should candidates for these positions emphasize that a company’s commitment to improving public welfare is a recruiting selling point, these companies might begin to acknowledge their outsized social impact. Condemning each alumnus holding a high paying job or excusing them from all responsibility for their employer’s actions are equally insufficient remedies. Instead, we should encourage collective action on the part of many newly minted professionals who can pledge to work for employers who don’t require workers to check their conscience at the door. If students banded together and gravitated towards socially conscious employers, then entire industries would be forced to change their approach towards public accountability to keep competing for top-flight talent.
This month’s attempted coup makes the case for shared accountability even more clear. While President Donald Trump and his minions in Congress bear the lion’s share of responsibility for inciting violence against our democratic system, the blame ought not fall solely on those occupying public office. The corporations who funded his campaign, the political operatives who helped him win, the media companies that amplified his message, and the consultants who abetted his cruelest plans all operate on the periphery of government. Guided by blind ambition, they hitched their wagons to the political fortunes of a man with contempt for democratic governance. So while we as the Harvard community are correct to denounce the examples of U.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), U.S. Representative Brian Mast (R-Fla.), and U.S. Representative Elise Stefanik ’06 (R-N.Y.), we should not forget their legion of private enablers that reside just beyond the eye of public scrutiny — many of them boasting the same sterling academic credentials afforded by our institution.
As a community and a nation, we should take seriously the joint public/private responsibility to advance the collective good. Progress in a complex world means that we can no more excuse private institutions from doing their fair share than we can rely entirely on the government to solve every problem alone. While altering our general mindset is by itself insufficient to deliver change, dispelling the fiction that private agents bear no responsibility for the public good and can run wild without restraint is a necessary first step towards a more prosperous future. Healing the trauma endured in recent months means that nobody, including the private sector, gets a free pass.
When Marshall announced the plan that would come to bear his name, he addressed the first regular commencement following the conclusion of World War II. Someday soon, Harvard will host its first graduation following another global catastrophe. On that May day, this institution and its graduates must embrace a new mode of thinking instead of retreating to an old and tired “normal.” I pray that such a new paradigm recognizes that maintaining the collective good requires a shared effort of both public and private institutions, whose members are empowered to hold them to account.

Harvard has established a committee and working groups to review the University’s sexual misconduct, discrimination, and bullying policies, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 announced in an email to Harvard affiliates Monday.
The committee will consist of three working groups composed of faculty, students, and staff, which will in turn be directed by a group of faculty and administrators. The review is the result of an agreement between the University and its graduate student union following months of dispute over the school’s sexual harassment policies during contract negotiations last spring.
The “Title IX Policy and Other Sexual Misconduct Policy” working group will review the University’s two interim policies and procedures announced in August. The policies, created in response to new Title IX regulations created by then-U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy D. Devos, address behavior covered under the new federal guidelines as well as behavior falling outside of the guideline’s jurisdiction.
The “Non-Discrimination Policy” working group will review how Harvard addresses complaints of discrimination other than sexual and gender-based harassment. The role of this group will be to propose new procedures for investigation and resolution, while increasing the school’s transparency when handling these cases.
Finally, the “Anti-Bullying” working group will focus on power-based harassment and misconduct by individuals in positions of authority. This group will review University procedures to address misconduct not in violation of sexual and gender-based harassment or discrimination policies.
Garber wrote that Harvard affiliates will have the opportunity to provide input to the working groups, noting the commission is part of an effort to ensure that Harvard is a safe place for all.
“One of the priorities of this University is to provide an environment where each of us can feel safe to participate fully in the life of the University, whether we are studying, teaching, conducting research, or working in other ways,” he wrote.

Following the successful election of three candidates last year, Harvard Forward is again vying for seats on the Board of Overseers, the University’s second-highest governing body.
Harvard Forward — a student and alumni organization working to call attention to climate action and racial justice issues within the University’s governance boards — announced on Nov. 17 that its 2021 slate of candidates includes three Harvard alumni: Yvette O. Efevbera, Megan H. Red Shirt-Shaw, and Natalie Unterstell.
The Harvard Alumni Association Nominating Committee announced on Jan. 12 eight nominees who will appear on the ballot. The eight nominations do not include the three candidates Harvard Forward proposed this year.
Efevbera, Red Shirt-Shaw, and Unterstell, however, can still make it onto the ballot by submitting a petition with 2,987 alumni signatures — one percent of eligible voters — by Feb. 3, previously done by Harvard Forward’s candidates in 2020.
In an email sent to Harvard affiliates on Jan. 19, Harvard Forward announced it had reached 2,150 signatures. Entering the final week of the petition period, however, the campaign estimates that it now needs around 500 more signatures for each of its candidates to qualify for the election ballot.
Harvard Forward previously put forward five candidates for the 2020 election. Though all five of last year’s candidates made it onto the election ballot, only three — Margaret “Midge” M. Purce ’17, Jayson U. Toweh, and Dorothy “Thea” L. Sebastian ’08 — were ultimately elected.
Following a September 2020 change in the Board’s policy, members nominated by petition can fill only 6 of the 30 total seats at any given time. With Purce, Toweh, and Sebastian only one year into their terms as Board members, a maximum of three additional candidates who are nominated by petition may be elected to serve until 2026.
The group’s platform advocates for total divestment of the University’s endowment from the fossil fuel industry and for a fossil fuel-free campus by 2030, while the University’s current climate action plan resolves to achieve fossil fuel-free operations by 2050.
This year, Harvard Forward expanded its platform to also prioritize racial justice issues. Its policy proposals include the creation of an Ethnic Studies department and concentration, as well as the divestment of the University’s endowment from the private prison industry.
Despite calls for divestment from students, alumni, and a majority of faculty members, Harvard has repeatedly declined to divest its endowment from fossil fuels and private prisons. University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in November 2020 that, while administrators agree climate change presents an urgent challenge, they “respectfully disagree” that divestment is the means the University should use to address it.
“Universities like Harvard have a crucial role to play in tackling climate change and Harvard is fully committed to leadership in this area through research, education, community engagement, dramatically reducing its own carbon footprint, and using our campus as a test bed for piloting and proving solutions,” Newton wrote.
Unterstell, a Harvard Kennedy School graduate from Brazil, served as a climate policy advisor for the Brazilian government and as a negotiator for her country’s delegation to the United Nations Convention on Climate Change.
She said her motivation is rooted in Harvard’s 2050 goal to achieve net-zero emissions, which she believes does not go far enough.
“I think what Harvard proposed or committed to in terms of the 2050 commitment is a small, good step, it goes in the right direction,” Unterstell said. “However, it's highly incomplete and insufficient, in my point of view.”
She also said that Harvard should be following in the footsteps of its peer institutions that have pulled their endowments out of fossil fuel investments.
A former resident tutor of Cabot House, Efevbera advises the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation on preventing gender-based violence and child marriage and promoting gender equality.
Efevbera holds a Master of Science in Global Health and a Doctor of Science in Population and Reproductive Health from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Her academic and nonprofit work has focused on issues at the intersection of youth and gender, such as female child marriage and HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa and the Diaspora.
She said she believes an important and exciting aspect of her campaign with Harvard Forward is the ability to elevate the voices of thousands of alumni.
“It's not just about selecting three great candidates, but it's really about getting more alumni engaged in voicing their perspectives — our perspectives — on what really matters and where the university needs to make changes — where the university needs to step up as a leader,” Efevbera said.
Similar to Efevbera, Red Shirt-Shaw — an education activist and graduate of the Harvard Graduate School of Education — said her decision to run for the Board of Overseers is rooted in bringing underrepresented perspectives to the forefront. Red Shirt-Shaw touched on her Indigenous roots and her impression that Harvard has not made strides to increase minority representation as well as her background in higher education.
“I'm indigenous, I'm Oglala Lakota, and I think, too, that there are a lot of promises that have not been kept by Harvard, historically, to those communities,” Red Shirt-Shaw added. “And so I think that was also a really large reason why I felt that it was important to make this run and to represent on the Harvard Forward platform with these incredible two other women.”
The election is scheduled to take place from April 1 to May 18. With the exception of those in University instruction and governance positions and members of the Harvard Corporation, all Harvard degree holders are eligible to vote in the election.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge City Council members discussed the findings of a recent residential survey on the city’s pandemic response and police department during a “roundtable” Zoom meeting on Monday.
The City of Cambridge Resident Telephone Survey, conducted by Polity Research Consulting, was conducted in September 2020 and published the following month. Ernest Paicopolos, the founder of Polity Research Consulting, and City Manager Louis A. DePasquale presented the survey’s findings.
Thirty-two of the 42 questions on the survey returned record-high levels of satisfaction with city services.
“I really believe these results reflect our highly capable and extremely dedicated workforce and the focus they have placed on the initiatives and priorities of the city council,” DePasquale said. “I want to thank the city staff for their hard work, especially during this pandemic.”
Despite the overall strong results, residents expressed decreasing satisfaction with certain city services, including policing and public education.
The percentage of Cambridge residents giving an “excellent” or “good” rating for police department services fell to 63 percent, an 18 percentage point drop from an all-time high of 81 percent in 2018.
Paicopolos noted that last summer’s national demonstrations against racial injustice and police brutality “certainly” contributed to the decline, which he called “a little bit troubling.”
Police Commissioner Branville G. Bard, Jr. said that, while this drop might be “spurious,” the city should closely analyze the results.
“It certainly warrants a deeper dive in to ensure that we have a firm understanding of what those numbers actually are,” Bard said.
The number of “excellent” and “good” ratings for public schools likewise fell from 78 percent to 63 percent. Paicopolos again said the drop is “troubling” and pointed to the challenges of virtual learning as a reason for the decline.
Satisfaction with senior services has steadily declined since the poll’s 2014 high of 62 percent. In 2020, just 38 percent of respondents rated the quality of senior services as being either “excellent” or “good.”
Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, the city observed a 20-year high in overall satisfaction with public services. 81 percent of respondents described Cambridge’s coronavirus response as either “good” or “excellent.”
Sixty-six percent of respondents gave the city government an “excellent” or “good” rating.
During the meeting, Cambridge City Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan noted the disparity in satisfaction between white respondents, and Black and “multiracial” respondents. While 53 out of 281 white residents gave an “excellent/good” rating, only one out of 38 Black residents and one out of 25 multiracial residents did.
“I certainly understand the desire to celebrate the numbers, but it doesn't give us a clear picture of where we can do better,” Zondervan said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council passed legislation Sunday to promote student “self-advocacy” regarding courses’ adherence to wellness days in its first meeting following winter recess.
The legislation, which passed unanimously, publicizes a guide entitled “Spring ‘21: Navigating Virtual Academics” that offers recommendations for how students can ensure course instructors observe wellness days — five days dispersed throughout the 2021 spring semester when classes will not convene on Zoom. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences implemented the new policy in lieu of spring break to reduce travel during the coronavirus pandemic.
The legislation was sponsored by a number of UC representatives, including President Noah A. Harris ’22 and Vice President Jenny Y. Gan ’22.
The UC drafted the guide in response to the results of a council-sponsored survey and accompanying town hall, which found students felt “overwhelmingly concerned” about FAS’s replacement of spring break with wellness days.
The guide outlines several steps students should take in the event that course instructors do not respect wellness days, which are meant to be “restorative,” per the College website. The guide, which provides template emails, recommends that students contact course staff, followed by the director of undergraduate studies for the course’s associated department and their resident dean with concerns.
“There are actionable emails included within the guide which proves to be really helpful,” Cabot House Representative Pallas Chou ’23, who sponsored the legislation, said.
The Office of Undergraduate Education and the Academic Resource Center suggested the UC draft such a guide to help alleviate student concerns. Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh and Academic Resource Center Director Donna Mumme reviewed the guide’s language prior to its publication, according to the agenda set by the UC for the meeting.
“We really want to make sure that every student has the tools that they need in order to be able to advocate for themselves,” Adams House Representative Esther J. Xiang ’23, another sponsor of the legislation, said.
During Sunday’s meeting, the council also passed legislation to streamline committee oversight.
The Council convened for a brief meeting to update members on ongoing efforts, including the disbursement of the Wintersession and Tech Insecurity funds and notifications about the upcoming midterm elections.
Sponsored by UC Secretary Secretary Nicholas J. Brennan ’23 and Ivy Yard Representative Arjun A. Akwei ’24, the amendment creates opportunities for collaboration between committees and also sets in motion a voting process for the Council to determine which committees have primary jurisdiction over a piece of legislation.
Though committees had previously worked together, Brennan said the Council did not have a seamless process to work on legislation that fell under the purview of multiple committees, leading to a “bureaucratic mess.”
“I think that this is something that was a long time running,” Brennan said after the meeting.
“This is part of a larger movement on the Council to make us a more receptive and efficient organization,” he added.
The legislation passed with a unanimous vote of the 23 representatives in attendance.

While Giulia F. Mazzarelli ’24 logged onto Italian 11: “Parliamo Italiano! The Art & Craft of Italy” from her bedroom in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., Jessica A. Boutchie ’21 ushered in her final semester of classes from her dorm room in Mather House. Across the Pacific, Charlie J. Yang ’24 attended Freshman Seminar 43J: “The Economist’s View of the World” at 2:30 a.m. local time in Sydney, Australia.
Despite being scattered across the globe, all enrolled Harvard students faced the same experience Monday — the start of the spring semester.
Students who lived at the College before the Covid-19 pandemic said beginning another semester of remote classes came with a unique set of challenges, but that they had grown accustomed.
Boutchie, who attended her morning class Russian BAb: “Intensive Intermediate Russian” from her Harvard dorm, said her final first day of a semester at the College went far differently from how she envisioned before the pandemic.
“It’s not how I expected my last first day of undergrad to go,” she said. “You go to your classes all from the same room, so there’s no awkward shuffling between classes on the first day, trying to find the best path to get from one place to another.”
Though Mazzarelli said she likes to stay positive, she also said studying from home can be isolating.
“This is school without interaction. You take away the contact with people — I love talking to people, I’m a social person,” she said. “Every day I’m like, ‘Oh my gosh, I feel like a robot’ because I work, eat, sleep, and then repeat. And it’s just the same thing over and over again because especially where I live, we’re still pretty locked down.”
To combat the isolation, students living with friends found ways to connect and collaborate.
Cynthia Chen ’24, who is living with friends in Cambridge, attended the course Computer Science 124: “Data Structures and Algorithms” with several of her roommates.
“We were all watching it together at the kitchen table,” she said. “I think it’s nicer watching with friends because it simulates some of the little things that might happen in an in-person setting. For example, if the teacher says something we don’t really understand, we’ll discuss it on the side. Also, I think it’s just more fun to watch it with friends.”
“I’ve heard the class is quite difficult, but I’m also pretty excited for the challenge of the class,” Chen added.
Yang, who said he met other international freshmen over Zoom last semester, added that he feels more confident as he resumes online learning at Harvard.
“I would actually say that I’m generally a bit more confident about this semester. Especially with the first semester, there were just so many unknowns — it was hard to get used to all the different programs and opportunities that Harvard offers,” he said. “I think that familiarity and the confidence that you have some people you know, some friends that you’ve made over Zoom is really cool.”
Yang also said he has adjusted to taking classes at odd hours of the day.
“I had a decent class at 8 a.m., which is pretty good. But then the rest of the classes are at 2:30 a.m., or something like that, so I’m probably watching recordings for that,” he said. “Which isn’t ideal, I guess I’m used to it already so it hasn’t been too bad.”
Halle C. Clottey ’23, who is living in Quincy House this semester, said the chat function on Zoom enabled people to connect despite being far away from each other.
“A lot of people were using the chat functionality, typing up all these different jokes that related to the class,” she said. “I think just being able to read through all of that, and seeing where everybody’s heads were at and looking at their reactions really built a nice community for the first day of class.”

Following the College’s decision to cut a popular education course from its fall offerings, undergraduates released a petition on Monday calling on Harvard’s administration to reconsider.
The College placed General Education 1076: “Equity and Excellence in K12 American Schools” — helmed by Harvard Graduate School of Education lecturer Katherine K. “Kay” Merseth — on a two-year rotation due to “budget constraints” necessitated by the pandemic on the General Education Program, according to College spokesperson Rachael Dane.
“In order to ensure that these courses still be available to students, the Gen Ed committee decided to put non-FAS courses on a two-year rotation – meaning they will still be available, just not every year,” Dane wrote in an emailed statement. “The Committee hopes to offer all these courses more frequently again in the future.”
Merseth said she “was devastated” when she received an email on Jan. 14 informing her that her course had been nixed from the upcoming academic year’s Gen Ed offerings.
“This course is the only course in the College that focuses on K-12 education,” Merseth said. “At this time, it's crucial that Harvard students be exposed to this crisis in our society.”
Dane declined to comment on Merseth's remarks.
The petition raised similar concerns about the course’s impact on students.
“Cutting a foundational Gen Ed course that is focused on equity in public education—in the middle of an educational crisis—is antithetical to Harvard’s supposed commitment to public service,” the student petition stated. “Only 2% of the Harvard College Class of 2020 are pursuing a career in education following graduation, and without this course, this number will no doubt be further reduced.”
“If Harvard truly wants to continue its “rich history of pedagogical innovation, the College should bolster institutional supports for students seeking to study education—not eliminate them,” it added.
Allison P. Pao ’21, a co-author of the petition and former course assistant, said the course was “life-changing” and “one of the primary reasons” she has chosen a career in education.
“This course changes lives and changes people's career paths,” she said. “For many people, it's the first time at Harvard where we really get a chance to just think about the past 13 years of our lives from kindergarten to 12th grade.”
Nina B. Elkadi ’22, another former course assistant who co-authored the petition, credited the course with inspiring her to pursue a career as a teacher, which was never a path she “considered at all” before starting college.
“Without this course, there isn't an equivalent to help inspire other undergraduates to become interested in education or teaching,” she said.
Zoya Surani ’22, another former course assistant who said she helped spread word of the petition, called the class “the gateway course” for the nascent Educational Studies secondary field, which is only two years old.
“It's kind of a low-stress, low-commitment way to test out if education is for you,” she said.
Pao compared the class to other popular foundational courses that are important for introducing students to a particular field.
“I consider this course to really be like the introduction to education course and to cancel it would be, to me at least, akin to canceling Ec10 or Introduction to Psychology,” she said.
Meaghan E. Townsend ’21, a co-author of the petition and former course assistant, said she worries about how the removal of the course from next fall’s offerings will impact the Educational Studies secondary and its “pipeline of students.”
Merseth said the College’s decision to cut the course reflects its differential treatment between FAS faculty and faculty from the various other schools.
“What that says to me is that they are biased against non-FAS faculty, which I feel runs contrary to what the Gen Ed program is supposed to do,” Merseth said. “It is supposed to engage all parts of the University, not just FAS.”
“I often say that 20 percent of our population are children under the age of 18, and they are 100 percent of our future in this country and in every country,” Merseth added. “So what could be more important than knowing something about this institution called schooling? Everybody goes, everybody attends. So what could be more important if you worry about the future of our society?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School Dean of Students Marcia L. Sells will leave her role on Feb. 15 to become the first Chief Diversity Officer at the New York Metropolitan Opera, the school announced Monday.
“While this will be a great...loss for the law school, it is an exciting professional opportunity for Dean Sells, who, in this newly created role, will help lead the Metropolitan Opera into its next chapter,” Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 wrote in an email.
The Met’s general manager, Peter Gelb, said in a Monday press release that Sells will “create artistic and administrative pathways for people of color” at the opera.
“At a time when social justice rightly demands that we address the inequities of our art form, I’m pleased that we have chosen the ideal candidate in Marcia for implementing long overdue and necessary change,” Gelb said.
During her five years in the Dean of Students position, Sells served on Harvard’s Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging, where, according to Manning, she had an “instrumental role” shaping the “framework for furthering the vital goals” of inclusion and belonging at Harvard.
Sells also served as co-chair of the HLS Student Well-Being Working Group and participated in both the University’s Task Force on Managing Student Mental Health and the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Steering Committee on Lawyer Well-Being.
Sells “brought a wealth of experience” to the Law School in 2015, Manning wrote. In addition to a 13-year tenure as an administrator at Columbia University, Sells held executive positions at NBA and Reuters, and served as an Assistant District Attorney for the state of New York.
Having previously served in associate dean and associate vice president positions at Columbia, Sells — who was also a dancer at the Cincinnati Ballet Company and the Dance Theatre of Harlem before her administrative career — said in an interview that she was excited to return to New York City, where she had spent many years before moving to Harvard.
“The opportunity to return is compelling — more than I realized,” Sells said. “It was great that I pushed myself to live outside of New York City after moving there from my hometown, but it feels good, it feels right.”
Sells said that the students were both the most challenging and most rewarding part of her job at the Law School.
“They get you to think about so many things — it was fascinating to see generationally how things changed in the world of student affairs from when I was Dean of Students in the 90s, to coming in 2015,” she said. “Most rewarding is that you get to meet this amazing group of students and learn from them and work with them.”
Sells described the beginning of her time at HLS as “momentous.” She was just three months into her tenure when the portraits of several Black law professors were vandalized with black tape, an incident police investigated as a hate crime, but were not able to locate the perpetrators.
Manning praised Sells’ dedication to student leaders in his email.
“A dedicated leader and mentor, Dean Sells has also been a strong supporter of Student Government, our many student organizations, and student-managed journals,” he wrote. “She worked with her team to enhance the training for student leaders.”
Though Sells said she is excited to begin her career at the Metropolitan Opera, she also said she will miss the unique experience of interacting with students at “the very beginning of their career journey.”
“I know what’s possible, having been a lawyer, and I also know what’s possible with a law degree,” Sells said. “I wish for the students that they get to really experience this — the joy of their careers when they look back.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences canceled a new course this semester focused on police counterinsurgency tactics after a widespread petition called for its withdrawal, SEAS Dean Francis J. Doyle III wrote in an email to school affiliates Monday.
SEAS bioengineering professor Kevin K. “Kit” Parker introduced Engineering Sciences 298R: “Data Fusion in Complex Systems: A Case Study” as a one-time opportunity to study the use of Counter-Criminal Continuum policing, or C3, by the police department in Springfield, Mass.
The law enforcement method — which Parker has conducted research into since at least 2012 — is based on military counterinsurgency tactics and has sparked controversy in Springfield. It involves community meetings to brainstorm neighborhood solutions to reduce gang violence and raise awareness about reporting suspicious activity through a team of resident “street leaders,” according to The New York Times.
Several student organizations began circulating a petition Sunday demanding the course be reviewed and withdrawn from the catalog. As of Monday night, the petition has more than 500 signatories including Harvard affiliates, local residents, and students and academics across the U.S.
In the petition, SEAS students and Harvard affiliates expressed concern that the class does not “meet ethical obligations” in ensuring the research process does not harm subjects or violate their privacy. The petition also argued that the course does not address the ways in which policing policies, including C3, have disproportionately affected minorities.
The petition called for investigations into the potential harms of C3 policing and a “full independent, third-party review” of Parker’s connections to C3 and his proposed research.
In his email to SEAS affiliates, Doyle wrote that he was aware of concerns about the “design and pedagogy of the proposed course” and that the course would not be offered as planned.
Doyle also wrote that in the current approval process, SEAS courses are “vetted” to align with the school’s “mission, vision, and values” before being added to the course catalog.
“During the coming days, the SEAS leadership will undertake a review of our course approval policies and procedures to determine if there are opportunities to further strengthen that system,” Doyle wrote.
SEAS spokesperson Paul Karoff declined to comment beyond Doyle’s statement.
Ciana Biasi-Smiley ’21, a signatory on the petition and Springfield native, said she found the premise of the course “deeply disturbing.”
“Looking at the merits of this type of policing, when we already know that this type of policing creates more violence, is not a useful exercise in any way and just legitimizes a racist practice that kills Black and Brown kids,” she said.
Springfield Police did not respond to a request for comment.
Parker defended his syllabus in an emailed statement to The Crimson Monday night, noting the course relies only on publicly available information and that the primary goal of the course is not an examination of racial bias within the police.
“While racial disparities are of concern with us, and we are mindful of how they might impact the data, it is not the specific focus of this work,” he wrote. “If disparities do emerge, we will report them accordingly.”
The petition also cast doubt over the legitimacy of Parker’s expertise to teach a course centered around a case study on policing. Parker, a cell biology and tissue engineering researcher, does not have a degree in criminal justice, social science, or criminology.
Daphne A. Kaxiras ’21, Parker’s research assistant, wrote in an emailed statement that the course staff “acknowledge” their lack of expertise in social sciences.
“[We] would love to have people on board who have such experience and can help us make this project the best it can be,” she wrote.
In addition to challenging his research experience, graduate student organizations including Harvard Alliance Against Campus Cops and Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers alleged in the petition that Parker took money from Springfield Police for the course and argued that the police department’s cooperation with the course constitutes a conflict of interest.
Maya E. Woods-Arthur ’23, an organizer for petition co-signer Harvard Prison Divest Campaign, said police reform deserves to be studied, but found Parker’s personal ties to the C3 strategy unacceptable.
According to Marisa J. Borreggine, the vice president of HGSU-UAW, if the course were to be offered, students would be “unpaid labor” for a “personal interest project” evaluating C3 policing efficacy in Springfield as part of Parker’s personal collaboration with the police department.
Two Iraq War veterans, Matthew M. Cutone and Thomas K. Sarrouf proposed the C3 strategy in 2009, modeling it after United States Army Special Forces counterinsurgency tactics employed overseas.
Parker, who served in Afghanistan, offered a similar course in 2012 in which students evaluated the effectiveness of the new policing method and found it increased calls to police and arrests while decreasing litter and graffiti, the New York Times reported in 2012.
Nine years ago, Cutone — who registered a trademark on “C3 Policing” that year — worked alongside Parker on the first iteration of the class by test-running C3 in Springfield. The pair made an appearance on the TV show “60 Minutes,” in which Parker revealed he met Cutone at National Guard training in 2011.
University policy dictates that an individual may have a conflict of interest if there is a financial connection to a “related outside entity.” A related outside entity includes anyone who “may reasonably appear” to influence research, further including anyone who owns intellectual property involved in a faculty member’s research.
Parker denied any financial ties to the Springfield Police Department.
“I get nothing from this project financially,” he wrote. “Only the personal satisfaction of trying to contribute to an understanding of an impoverished community who has made some very courageous decisions about taking control of their fate from violent criminal gangs.”
Parker argued against canceling the course, noting that it is part and parcel of academic liberty.
“I expect Harvard to display the moral courage to support its faculty who endeavor to lead such projects....and their academic freedom,” he wrote.

We didn’t choose Zoom University, Zoom University chose us. As we adapt to another semester of learning during these “unprecedented times,” we need to have as smooth of a Zoom experience as possible. Unfortunately, our biggest roadblocks can sometimes be four very own professors who tend to do things that make us just want to shut our laptops and crawl back into bed.
Disabling the Chat
Sometimes you just want to rant to your best friend about how much you hate Zoom or perhaps you want to spice the lecture up with some fun banter and cheesy jokes. However, much to your disappointment, your professor has disabled the chat, withholding it from you like a forbidden fruit. Now you are forced to *actually* pay attention to the lecture (it turns out that that is what we’re actually supposed to do, who knew?).
Assigning 100+ Pages of Reading
For some reason, some professors assume that because we are studying online, we have more time to spare so they generously overload us with enough reading that would put War and Peace to shame. Between Zoom fatigue and trying to cope with living in a whole global pandemic, we just do not have time to be suffering through 50 book chapters and 20 articles every week.
Going Overtime
In this world of Zoom fatigue, those 15 minutes of respite in between classes are needed to step away from the screen you have been staring at for the past what-felt-like-20 years. When professors go overtime, we are robbed of the time we need to rejuvenate and resurrect ourselves before our next class. As an international student living 6 hours ahead of Boston, when I have back-to-back classes at night, those 15 minutes constitute my dinner time. Fifteen minutes barely gives me enough time to scoff down my dad’s homemade lasagna, so if professors could just not make it any harder by going overtime, that would be great.
Breakout Rooms
I don’t know about you, but breakout rooms are the bane of my very existence. Nothing on God’s green earth is more awkward than the moment after you and your classmates have arrived in your breakout room and you proceed to spend the next five minutes staring intently into each other’s eyes waiting for someone to initiate the conversation. Nothing makes my heart leap more than seeing the countdown window appear like my long-awaited saviour.
Scheduling Class on Wellness Days
Need I say more?
Zoom University certainly has its ups and downs, and sometimes our professors make those downs even lower. But in the end, we’re all figuring out this new virtual world together, and our professors would probably appreciate any feedback you can give them — after all, they’re people too! At the very least, always remember that the “leave meeting” button can be your best friend.
