After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I believe in the importance of nonsense. More specifically, that a little bit of nonsense in life is very valuable. Nonsense, in this case, being internet memes.
Usually, I’m quick to criticize the internet. I have dedicated a significant amount of time to blaming it for many of our generation’s social conflicts. And honestly, contemplating social media and the web at large frequently leads me down a path of existential desperation. But memes are, for me, an exception. They are deceivingly relevant and their function is more profound than their shallow perceptions afford them. Of course, not all memes are funny, many are pointless, and offensive ones are unacceptable. But the concept of a meme is significant. It is an authentic, unfiltered expression rarely seen elsewhere online. It is a sign of humanity, something we often try to erase from our virtual selves.
Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins coined the term “meme” in his 1976 book “The Selfish Gene,” where he defines it as “a unit of cultural transmission.” From the Greek word “mimema,” meaning “imitated,” memes are contingent on imitating relevant cultural patterns. Dawkins considers memes to be cultural genes — they have heredity, undergo replication, and require fitness to survive. His analogy, while so unfortunately untimely, explains meme fitness in terms of virus: ideas worth passing on are contagious.
The fittest, most contagious memes allow us to feel and relate to others. Their images — the face of Sulley from “Monsters, Inc.” superimposed onto Mike Wazowski’s, Kermit the Frog drinking tea, or Baby Yoda — are so detached from reality, that we feel free to laugh at their captions because there is distance between us and them. Without feeling exposed, we empathize.
But memes are so refreshing because they remind us to take ourselves less seriously. When an online audience is constantly watching and judging, they render our every action a performance — an evaluation of self. So choosing what information to disclose and how we should look on our profiles is in itself an act. Who we so carefully portray is a character. However, memes are a break in character — a sigh of relief when we’re off stage. Through memes’ ridiculousness, we acknowledge the show can’t go on forever. We’re flawed and our flaws can be funny. We take off our masks to laugh at the fact that we can be a mess. Sometimes, relating to a comic of a dog sitting in flames drinking coffee insisting “this is fine” can be therapeutic.
This critique through parody is no novelty. In the early 1700s, Italian playwright Carlo Goldoni innovated the theatre scene and revitalized “commedia dell’arte,” a then-declining dramatic art form, to realize a vision proving quite meme-like. Just as memes unveil a more authentic emotional and human experience, Goldoni eliminated the use of masks and replaced stock characters with more realistic personalities. And like our trove of recycled meme images, Goldoni created a fixed set of these personalities. Their scripted jokes were scattered into improvised acting, functioning much like captions we apply according to context.
In addition to emotional release, Goldoni’s dramatic arts offered cultural commentary and political criticism. His productions were popular for their transgressive humour, actors often speaking in Italian dialects to criticize the different regions of Italy. And we see much the same online, memes calling out the odd idiosyncrasies of different states or disagreeing with our government. Especially in the COVID era, we are in constant disagreement with laws, politicians, and each other. As Goldoni’s productions did so many years ago, memes give us grounds to transgress. In the guise of ridiculousness, we can push the boundaries and express contentious opinions without direct, explicit confrontation. After all, where else would we be able to overlay a “Karen” wig onto Donald Trump’s hair?
Yet the real beauty of Goldoni’s art and the world of memes is their ability to pantomime and portray the world as it is. As viewers, we enjoy watching scenarios in which we can see ourselves — joyful, tragic, awkward, or hopeless as they may be. Experiencing objectively helps us process. It takes the edge off the lives we live so seriously.
But while history repeats itself to a large extent, it evolves, too. Memes are far more abstract than people playing parts on stage. That we can feel seen by seeming gibberish may go to show just how critical of ourselves we have become; we don’t like it when things get too real. Our solution, then, is both escape and catharsis. Teary-eyed cats, Spongebob imitating a chicken, or Bernie Sanders “once again asking” for something cushions the blow of discomfort or dissent.
The internet has become a place full of dividing constructs like artificial hierarchies, popularity contests, or assessments of perceived success. But we’re not walking LinkedIn profiles or Facebook bios and we all know it. We’re more memeish than we are post-like, so embrace the memeishness. To accept ourselves, organically human and imperfect as we are, we have to laugh a little. Of course, there are sides of us that are less than brag-worthy, but there is no need to deny them. No one is spared by the truth of memes; they’re an unexpectedly equalizing online presence. Regardless of status and online artifice, we naturally react and relate to one another in the same way. We all feel the joy of laughter when we come across that meme that resonates. The power of a meme shouldn’t be underestimated just because it seems like nonsense — nonsense isn’t worthless. It allows us to laugh together. And there’s no nonsense more meaningful than that.

Following Harvard College’s decision to hold fall classes online, nearly 20 percent of undergraduates decided to take a leave of absence. Among that number are student athletes, many of whom opted to pause their college careers after the Ivy League cancelled fall sports in July.
To examine the enrollment status of varsity athletes at Harvard, The Crimson analyzed the composition of the 1,016 students listed on Harvard Athletics Department rosters. Of the non-senior athletes whose names appeared on rosters for the 2019-2020 school season, 339 disappeared from the 2020-2021 rosters. One some teams, only one upperclassmen remained on the list; others saw an increase in their numbers.
Those more than 300 students took different approaches to deciding the future of their academic and athletic careers. Some made the decision to transfer in the next school year and preserve their eligibility. Others may have quit their sport. Many, though, have simply decided not to enroll this semester.
Athletes made those decisions in an unusual climate for Harvard sports. The Ivy League cancelled its fall and winter sports seasons, and Harvard has limited on-campus living to freshmen and a small share of upperclassmen this semester to curtail the virus's spread. As a result, several student-athletes said they took time off to preserve eligibility for future seasons in which they hope compete in person.
Certain sports took a much bigger hit than others. The men’s squash team, men’s lacrosse team and men’s heavyweight rowing team saw a 65 percent and 80 percent decrease in their roster sizes, respectively. Women’s ice hockey and men’s golf each have just one remaining upperclassman. The women’s ice hockey team has four freshmen, and the men’s golf team has one other freshman.
Overall, the size of 20 teams decreased by more than 30 percent. Only two sports, women’s golf and men’s wrestling, listed more members on their current rosters than they did last year.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on the record on the data.
Kevin Z. Sze ’24, the lone freshman on the men’s golf team, said the two-member team has had little interaction this fall. He added that he started an informal practice group with women’s golf players.
“I think [the senior, Grant] is in California, I want to say, and I really haven’t talked to him too much. But on the women’s side, three of the women first-years are enrolled, so I’ve been practicing and working out with them,” Sze said.
Sze added that the team’s cohesive culture may have prompted upperclassmen to wait to return to school until they could play together.
“We’ve built such a great team culture here, and that we have kind of the right pieces and the right players and the right mindset to go out and win the championship and be very, very competitive. So I think that’s an opportunity that a lot of guys don’t want to miss out on,” Sze said. “This is a team that really wants to win, and we want to get as many shots as we can.”
Liam L. Waterous ’21, one of three enrolled upperclassmen remaining on the men’s squash team, said he thought his teammates’ decisions to take leaves was informed in large part by a desire to compete in person.
“The predominant reason why they took leaves is because they just want to play squash when they’re at Harvard,” Waterous said. “Some guys are just training extra hard at squash back home.”
“Maybe it’s just a testament to how close the team is, how good the culture is, and how committed we are to playing,” he added.
Several teams also saw fewer freshmen joining their rosters than in previous years. Sixteen teams took in fewer freshmen than the number of seniors that left the team upon graduating last year. While sixteen seniors graduated from men’s lightweight rowing last year, for example, the team only took in seven new freshmen. Twelve seniors graduated from women’s rugby, but only three freshmen joined.
Both men’s lightweight rowing and women’s rugby have fairly large proportions of international students, with 19 percent and 30 percent, respectively, coming to Harvard from a high school outside the United States. Though Harvard allowed all members of the Class of 2024 to live in residence, federal immigration rules prevented the College from inviting international freshmen, who could not obtain F-1 or J-1 visas to enter the U.S.
Nordic ski coach Chris City ’94 said that while there may be differences across sports, he thought skiers centered academic considerations when deciding whether to take leave.
“At least on my team, a lot of it was more to do with where they were in their careers than necessarily sports-specific considerations,” City said.
Still, the rosters may not entirely reflect the current composition of Harvard varsity teams.
Men’s fencing and heavyweight rowing, the two sports to which no new freshmen joined the roster, do have new freshmen recruits, according to upperclassmen on those teams.
While schools such as Dartmouth and Stanford have cut teams due to coronavirus-related financial losses, Athletics Director Erin H. McDermott said the department is not considering making a similar decision.

The Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study hosted a virtual panel focused on how COVID-19 has exacerbated racial and economic inequalities in higher education Thursday.
The panel — titled “The Impact of 2020 on Higher Education: Colleges, COVID-19 and a Time of Racial Reckoning” — featured Harvard Graduate School of Education assistant professor Anthony A. Jack, UCLA Associate Professor of Education Eddie R. Cole, and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Associate Professor of Philosophy Jennifer M. Morton. The event, which drew more than 600 attendees, was moderated by Graduate School of Education PhD candidate Kemeyawi Q. Wahpepah ’09.
The panelists discussed how long-standing challenges — such as food and housing insecurity, as well as lack of access to internet and healthcare — are driving an extra-wide wedge between marginalized students and their peers in the pandemic era.
Morton further stressed that students of color and students from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds shoulder “ethical costs” as they grapple with a dilemma between pursuing higher education or fulfilling familial obligations.
“As those students were starting their lives, getting excited, going to college, and trying to get a degree, they were also in this position of having to help families, friends, and others around them,” Morton said. “This push and pull of feeling torn between pursuing their own educational advancement, their own opportunities, and being there for the people that they love was very difficult for the students.”
Jack said universities have a responsibility to support their economically disadvantaged students during the ongoing pandemic. He suggested that universities should make resources, such as the option of on-campus housing, available for students who “know that home and harm are synonymous.”
“It’s not just the universal reality of pain that COVID brought,” Jack said. “It’s the uneven effect of that pain, that hurt, that loss, that certain communities are grappling with that universities have to be able to be prepared for.”
Looking beyond the effects COVID-19, the panelists also discussed the general state of support for people of color in higher education. They agreed that finding the right mentors and building a network was “crucial” to their own academic journeys.
Cole emphasized that internal resources, such as commitment and focus, were equally key to success.
“For faculty of color, particularly people new to academia, you just have to stay focused on your heart and what you know your work is to be and what questions you are committed to pursuing,” Cole said. “That is what will support you just as much as other people — knowing what you’re committed to, knowing the work ahead of you.”
This event was supported by the Radcliffe Institute’s “Harvard and the Legacy of Slavery,” a University-wide, presidential initiative created in 2019 to examine Harvard’s connections to the slave trade.
Harvard and the Legacy of Slavery Project Manager Cristine Hutchison-Jones said that this panel illuminated the present-day impacts of slavery in higher education — especially how they interact with COVID-19.
“This particular program emerged from our focus...on how the extraordinary challenges facing communities of color in 2020, including health disparities laid bare by the global pandemic and protests for racial justice, are impacting our university community,” she wrote in an email to The Crimson.
Moving forward, the Radcliffe Institute plans to continue its research — led by sociology professor William J. Wilson — on the pandemic’s disproportionate impact on students of color.
Correction: November 20, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly named the host of a virtual panel focused on how COVID-19 has exacerbated racial and economic inequalities in higher education. It is the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, not the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Studies.

Researchers at Harvard, California State University, Sacramento, and University of California, Santa Barbara, discovered a new gene responsible for nectar spur development in columbine flowers, according to a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in September.
Study co-author and basketball fan Evangeline S. Ballerini said she named the gene POPOVICH — POP, for short — after Gregg Popovich, head coach and president of the San Antonio Spurs.
“I’m a nerdy scientist and a sports fan. I wanted to play off of the San Antonio Spurs and the columbine spurs,” Ballerini said.
Much like a coach directs players, POP directs nectar spur development in columbine flowers and is essential to promoting biodiversity, according to Ballerini.
Ballerini — who currently serves as an assistant biology professor at CSU Sacramento — co-authored the study with Organismic and Evolutionary Biology professor Elena M. Kramer, UCSB biology professor Scott A. Hodges, and Harvard graduate students Molly B. Edwards and Ya Min.
The discovery was the result of a cross-country collaboration between Ballerini, her Ph.D. dissertation advisor Kramer, and her postdoctoral fellowship mentor Hodges.
Hodges said he has embarked on a “lifelong quest” to map out the relationships between columbine flowers and related species. He added that the Aquilegia genus, to which columbine flowers belong, is unique because it has achieved incredible diversity in a relatively short period of time, with minimal genetic variance between species.
Rapid speciation in columbine flowers is due in large part to nectar spurs, which allow the flowers to attract different pollinators and eventually become reproductively isolated with little genetic change.
“The big picture question is just how has diversity on the planet evolved, and this is a good system to address those questions,” Ballerini said.
After working in Kramer’s lab, Ballerini joined Hodges on some of his evolutionary biology projects with columbine flowers at UCSB.
When Ballerini crossed a spurred columbine species with the only spurless columbine species, she was able to identify a region of 1000 individual genes associated with spur development.
To narrow down this list of genes, she conducted another experiment where she crossed four different columbine species. Ballerini compared these results with a prior dataset from Min that studied the expression of genes in early spur development.
Cross analysis of the two datasets allowed Ballerini to identify eight common genes, among which only one, POP, was expressed in the quantitative trait locus, suggesting a connection between the gene and the absence of spurs in the spurless species.
The researchers said they are hopeful their discovery will help them further map out the evolution and development of nectar spurs.
“To get a complete picture of how spurs evolve, we need to know the players of what we call upstream and downstream of POP,” Hodges said, adding that further research is needed to identify which genes POP controls as well as which genes control POP.
“We can then start asking even further questions about all those other groups of plants that independently evolved spurs. How did they do it?” Hodges said.
POP also opens up developmental biology questions about its function.
“We have shown that POP is necessary for spur development, but we have not yet proven that POP is sufficient for spur development,” Kramer said. “Is it what we might call a master regulatory gene for spur development?”
Ballerini said the culmination of this project was particularly rewarding, given her longtime “dream” of discovering a novel gene.
“When I was an undergrad and I first was learning about genetics and evolution, I had this dream of ‘Oh, you could identify genes that are really important for evolution,’” Ballerini said. “It took a while but, in a way, in this paper I’m sort of fulfilling my undergrad dreams.”

Harvard Law School lecturer and alumnus Ronald A. Klain was appointed President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s chief of staff earlier this month.
In a Nov. 11 announcement, Biden appointed Klain as White House Chief of Staff and Assistant to the President. Klain — who is no stranger to the White House, managing contagious disease outbreaks, or navigating contested elections — will be responsible for overseeing the Executive Office of the President and serving as a senior advisor.
He previously worked alongside Biden as his first Chief of Staff in 2009. The two had worked together during Biden’s tenure as Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee when Klain was the committee’s Chief Counsel.
Klain also played a role during Biden’s 1988 and 2008 campaigns. Most recently, he served as a senior advisor in Biden’s 2020 campaign.
“Ron has been invaluable to me over the many years that we have worked together, including as we rescued the American economy from one of the worst downturns in our history in 2009 and later overcame a daunting public health emergency in 2014,” Biden said in a press release.
Klain’s commitment to public service extends beyond his time working for Biden. He served as Chief of Staff for Vice President Al Gore as well as Chief of Staff and Counselor to Attorney General Janet Reno.
During the 2014 Ebola epidemic, President Barack H. Obama appointed Klain as the White House Ebola Response Coordinator — a role which earned Klain the moniker “Ebola Czar.”
Law School professor Einer R. Elhauge ’83 — one of Klain’s classmates — praised his qualifications and character, describing him as the ideal chief of staff.
“Ron Klain is brilliant, astute, and level-headed,” Elhauge wrote in an email. “If one wanted to design the perfect chief-of-staff, he would be it.”
At Harvard, Klain has lectured at the Law School since 2017. He graduated magna cum laude from the school in 1987, winning the Sears Prize for highest grade point average in 1985. Klain was also an Editor of the Harvard Law Review.
Klain credits several professors at Harvard Law School as being “incredibly influential” in his life, including Martha L. Minow and Laurence H. Tribe ’62.
Minow, who was dean of the Law School for eight years, lauded Klain in an email.
“Ron Klain is a person of enormous integrity, talent, and judgment,” she wrote. “I can’t imagine a person with more effectiveness, and wisdom ready to lead during both tough times and good times.”
Klain credits Tribe as the most impactful figure from Harvard Law School to guide him in his career.
“No Harvard professor has been as influential to me as Larry Tribe, who has been a mentor, a counselor, and a friend,” Klain wrote in an email. “Whenever I face a hard legal question, Larry is the first person I call.”
Tribe praised Klain on Twitter following his appointment.
“Ideally suited to this crucial role, Ron is a man for all seasons,” Tribe wrote. “He has the brilliance, experience, wit, political savvy and wisdom this nearly impossible role demands.”
Stepping into the role of a mentor himself, Klain wrote in a Oct. 28 email to The Crimson that he has helped several of his students get jobs on the Biden campaign. When reflecting on the amount of Harvard affiliates associated with the campaign, Klain said the correlation came as no surprise.
“It’s no surprise that the kind of people who teach and attend Harvard would be involved in the Biden campaign: they are active, public-minded, and determined to change things for the better,” Klain wrote.
Despite Klain’s strong ties to Harvard, he wrote that one of his favorite things about the Biden campaign was the mix of people from many institutions.
“What I love about the Biden campaign is that it is a mix of people from all sorts of institutions – people from all walks of life,” Klain wrote. “Joe Biden likes to point out that – if he wins – he will be the first public college alum in 40 years to win the Presidency, and Senator Harris is the first HBCU alum on a national ticket.”
Klain said in a press release announcing his appointment that he is honored to continue to work with Biden and to assemble a diverse team of his own within the Executive Office.
He also said he looks forward to “heal the divides in our country.”
“I think Donald Trump has been a horrible President – one of the very worst in history – and the people who have played a role in getting him elected and trying to get him reelected can explain their own choices,” he said. “I’m happy to explain mine.”

Last Friday, Cambridge earned a unique accolade: it became the first small city in the United States to boast its own edition of the Monopoly board game.
Cambridge residents may find properties from this newest edition of Monopoly strikingly familiar. The Cambridge edition of the popular board game — released by the toy and game company Hasbro, Inc. on Nov. 13 — features recognizable sites throughout the city, such as Longfellow Bridge, the Charles River, the Cambridge Public Library, Cambridge City Hall, and Graffiti Alley.
“We are excited about Monopoly’s newest edition of the game showcasing my hometown – Cambridge, Massachusetts,” Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui said to NBC Boston. “This edition will bring residents and non-residents together in exploring Cambridge’s beautiful, diverse, and rich history, all while playing this iconic game.”
Cambridge residents voted to select the locations that would be represented this past summer. Harvard — as well as surrounding colleges and universities like MIT — has its own property on the board.
The new Monopoly edition also includes a variety of historic sites in Cambridge, such as Longfellow House, the home of the renowned poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Mount Auburn Cemetery, the first garden cemetery in the United States.
Three Cambridge-based nonprofit organizations — the Cambridge Health Alliance, the American Repertory Theater, and Lovin’ Spoonfuls — are featured on Community Chest cards.
Hasbro also invited the Cambridge Health Alliance to have its own square on the Monopoly board, according to David Sternburg, who serves as director of development for the Cambridge Health Alliance.
The Cambridge Health Alliance operates the Cambridge Public Health Commission, Sternburg said. It provides access to medical care for vulnerable people who have been greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
“People recognize what we’ve been doing and recommend us,” Sternburg said. “We go above and beyond to really help people in the community feel safe and cared for.”
The Cambridge Monopoly edition launched last week at the Kimpton Hotel Marlowe.

The Harvard Management Company significantly increased its investment in Facebook after a substantial sell-off and bought stocks in a gambling company and a work-management app as the overall value of their public securities holdings increased by nearly 55 percent during the third quarter.
HMC’s gains and acquisitions in the third quarter — which ran from July 1 through Sept. 30 — were revealed as part of its latest filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investment managers who oversee more than $100 million are required to disclose public securities holdings each quarter.
In its last filing on Aug. 14, HMC reported its securities were valued at about $459 million, a decrease from the previous quarter. They submitted an amendment to its filings on Sept. 18 that added over $713 million in shares in Royalty Pharma, a pharmaceutical company.
In the third quarter, HMC reported that the value of its public securities had increased to $1,818,481,000.
The number of HMC’s holdings in Facebook increased in quarter three by over 540 percent, to nearly 1.09 million. In the previous quarter, HMC had significantly reduced its shares in Facebook, from almost 1.3 million to just 170,000.
HMC also substantially increased its shares in Alphabet, Inc., the parent company of Google, by nearly 148 percent, bringing its value to nearly $230 million.
HMC also added shares in Intercontinental Exchange, a technology company; Scientific Games Corp., a company that provides gambling products to lotteries and casinos; Relay Therapeutics, a Cambridge-based biotechnology company; Dyntek, an IT-service management company; and Asana, a work management app.
The acquisition of Scientific Games Corp. for its public securities portfolio diverges from HMC’s traditional investing patterns. In the past, its public holdings have only been in biopharmaceutical and technology companies.
HMC also increased its shares in Palo Alto Networks, a technology company, by over 111 percent, and upped its shares in Powershares QQQ, an exchange-traded fund, by 72 percent.
HMC spokesperson Patrick S. McKiernan declined to comment, citing HMC’s policy not to comment on specific investments.
Rutgers Business School professor John M. Longo wrote in an email that the investments were “not surprising” choices for the University, given the stature of Alphabet and Facebook and the “large weight” of the companies in equity indexes.
Longo noted that the decision could have been made due to favorable market conditions during the quarter.
“It is not clear from HMC’s Form 13F when they purchased the stocks over the quarter. There were brief pullbacks in technology stocks in late July and late September, possibly providing HMC with an attractive entry point. The major risks to the stocks are primary regulatory in nature and not due to near-term competitive threats,” he wrote.
Longo said that HMC could be taking into account worsening COVID-19 conditions in the United States.
“Over the short-term perhaps HMC’s management team anticipated continued lockdowns across parts of the country, which may provide a boost to these “stay at home” tech giants until COVID-19 vaccines are widely manufactured and disseminated,” he wrote.

Justice Mumbi Ngugi, a judge on the High Court of Kenya, discussed the impacts of Kenya's new constitution upon social and health equality within the country at a Thursday webinar hosted by the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics at Harvard Law School.
The new constitution was passed in 2010 by a referendum, receiving 67 percent of the population’s support. Ngugi called the new constitution “transformative,” since it contains more progressive stances on economic, social, and health rights.
Ngugi — an advocate for women, socially disadvantaged persons, and the albinism community — said the “major provisions” of the new constitution aim to help Kenyans with disabilities and women.
“People with disabilities, people who are different from others have tended to be excluded,” Ngugi said, adding that the new constitution “has specific requirements that all institutions make sure that there’s reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities” and “has also made a significant difference in the way we order our society.”
Ngugi added that the constitution calls for greater participation of women in government.
“The idea was to make sure that there is greater inclusion and participation of women within elected and appointed bodies in the country,” she explained. “Any society in which women cannot properly participate in governance or in decision-making, you will find that it is a society that doesn't really progress as it should.”
Senior Fellow at the Petrie-Flom Center and event moderator Alicia E. Yamin ’87 discussed the work of the Commission for the Implementation of the Constitution, which is meant to oversee the development of legislation and administrative procedures necessary to implement the constitution. The 2010 constitution outlines a right to health, and so part of the work of the commission includes overseeing measures to implement healthcare availability in financially-constrained communities.
“If you can address the underlying determinants of health, sanitation, what’s good potable water, good nutrition, then you reduce the burden on people from having to seek health care because of those illnesses,” Ngugi said.
Ngugi added that government officials are “working hard” to ensure that the rights stated in the constitution do not become “empty” words.
“We have people in the different sectors of our society who are working hard to ensure that there is access to health care for all.” Ngugi said. “So, we may not have as much clout, in terms of moving policy forward, but it can make pronouncements that help to make a move in points, the direction towards what the people of Kenya expect.”
Ngugi emphasized the need for “compassion” and international cooperation to help progress human rights and to stop the spread of Covid-19.
“We used to believe in all of these international agreements, compassion for each other. We used to believe in human rights. We used to believe in nondiscrimination. And we used to work towards equality for all, and I have a feeling that we’re losing that,” Ngugi said.
Yamin said she hopes attendees are better able to understand Kenya as a “plural democracy” and not just a place of “ethnic strife and fighting.”
“I hope this breaks down the idea that Kenya must be someplace where people go on safari or something like that,” Yamin said. “Kenya is actually a plural democracy that is struggling with many of the same struggles that other countries around the world are struggling with.”
“The constitution as this transformative document, that is meant to include many different kinds of people, is playing a role in that. Judges are making decisions about the rights and opportunities that diverse people in Kenyan society get to enjoy.”
Correction: November 20, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Alicia E. Yamin ’87 called Kenya a "liberal democracy." In fact, she called it a "plural democracy."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge’s Economic Development and University Relations Committee passed a motion Thursday calling on the city to explore implementing a program that would encourage selecting bids from women- and minority-owned businesses for government contracts.
Women and minorities historically face steeper challenges when starting and running a business, Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon said during the committee’s public meeting. She pointed out that Cambridge has yet to take advantage of methods local municipalities can utilize to ease those challenges. Such initiatives include a sheltered market program like the one the committee eventually endorsed, grants, vendor fairs, technical support, and resource connection.
The sheltered market program would prioritize bids for city projects from businesses owned by people of color, women, and people with disabilities.
Still, the city may face some challenges implementing the program because of state laws requiring cities to award certain contracts to the “responsible and responsive” vendor offering the lowest price. For contracts between $10,000 to $50,000, cities must pick the cheapest vendor; for contracts totaling more than $50,000, they must take price into account during a competitive bidding process.
In order to follow those guidelines while also promoting WMBEs, Elizabeth Unger, purchasing agent for the City of Cambridge, said the city could consider using vendors certified by the Massachusetts Operational Services Division. Doing so would allow Cambridge to choose a contract based on a best-value evaluation instead of the lowest price, and therefore place higher value on vendors who have slightly higher costs but are minority- or women-owned.
Supporting more WMBEs would also rely on “a department making the conscious effort to reach out specifically to vendors that they knew were minority business enterprises, women business enterprises, and other disadvantaged vendors,” Unger said.
Pardis Saffari, senior economic development manager of Cambridge’s Community Development Department, said the city should pursue a variety of outreach initiatives aimed at diversifying its vendors. She cited solutions like targeted marketing to businesses in the city’s Diversity Directory, adding vendor questions to the Cambridge Business Certificate Application, and promoting online training programs on bidding.
During the public comment portion of the meeting, Nicola Williams, facilitator of the Cambridge-Somerville Black Business Network, outlined a series of actions she hoped the city would take.
“The most important one is that we need data — we need to know what the percentage of contracts the city trades with, with MBEs. The state does it, the city of Boston does it, I don’t think Cambridge does it. And if we don’t have a way to measure it, how do we know how we’re doing?” she said.
Christina DiLisio, an associate economic development specialist, said the Community Development Department is working to present their backend data in the form of a searchable digital tool. The tool would complement a print Diversity Directory the city plans to release with Cambridge Local First by the end of the year.

Dear Dunster W120,
I cried the first time I saw you, not because I was sad, but because within moments of our meeting, I knew this was the real thing. I placed my extra large can of RAID: Roach and Ant on the table and leapt with joy onto my mattress covered in years of oddly brown stains. At night, I slept soundly as my window gave me a front seat view of the rats running across the pathway, delightfully scurrying on their way to Mather. Ah, yes. I had it good with you.
From the first 24 hours that I spent sequestered in you, I got to know your entire layout quite well, from the smelly hangers someone left in my closet to the contact lenses strewn across the bathroom floor. I can decidedly say that even though I left you as soon as I could to go study at Widener (the life of the party, am I right?) or the Smith Campus Center (still didn’t get any work done) or Cabot Library (Harvard is incredibly creative with donors) what we had was something special. 
Unfortunately, I’m breaking up with you. My childhood bedroom texted me a week ago and wanted its girl back. I know I told you I was done with that, but my parents are planning to cook dinner for me, and let’s face it, you only offer Red’s Best Catch. Well, they didn’t tell you that I’M THE BEST CATCH. You’ve been awfully strange these past few weeks. When I’m in Zoom calls, I get all these weird background noises from people mowing their lawns. At night, I close my eyes for five seconds and then an alarm rings. Is that all you’re doing?
Let’s face it, you and I were never going to work out long-term. As I pack my bags to move away from you, I notice tiny things. Like the dust on the floor. Was I supposed to clean that up? I thought you would’ve told me.
In any case, don’t call me. I hope that you can find it in yourself to move on. Of course, I might be coming back in town for next semester, then that might be a different story… So, see you around?
Not yours,
Matylda
