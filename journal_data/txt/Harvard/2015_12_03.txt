After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has spent months focusing on inclusivity outside the classroom. Now, it's time to begin examining how the issue manifests itself inside the classroom as well. A recent Crimson report highlighted a central concern in this area: Despite Harvard’s vast array of concentrations—49 in total—many students do not feel free to choose between them. In order for the University to best fulfill its mission of providing a liberal arts education to everyone it admits, Harvard must open its concentrations to its increasingly diverse student body.
A report recently released by the College’s Working Group on Diversity and Inclusion included a recommendation that Harvard’s academic departments, particularly in the STEM fields, create clearer pathways for students whose high schools provided fewer academic opportunities like Advanced Placement courses. Not fully addressed, however, is the converse issue: the desire of students from less affluent backgrounds to choose career-oriented concentrations, often at the expense of the arts and humanities.
At Harvard, a plurality of students consistently declare concentrations in economics in the hopes of pursuing careers in finance or consulting. This trend has national analogues. According to data examined in an article by Joe Pinkser in The Atlantic, wealthier students are more likely to pursue degrees in the liberal arts because they feel less constrained by post-graduation career prospects. Less wealthy students often choose to concentrate in social science and STEM subjects with clearer prerequisites and obvious applications to future jobs.
While it would be impractical to argue that students should not consider their employment prospects while choosing a concentration, every academic opportunity at the College should be available to every student regardless of prior experiences with the field. At the same time, Harvard must also maintain its rigorous academic focus. This conflict is the crux of the problem: Introductory classes must be both demanding and welcoming to people of all backgrounds. While certainly flawed in other ways, Computer Science 50 has excelled in this regard by advertising the fact that nearly 80 percent of its incoming students have no previous coding experience. Such advertising has allowed a notoriously difficult computer science class to become the most popular class at Harvard and Yale this semester.
Issues of inclusivity are  particularly prevalent in fields like classics, which may appear to have daunting prerequisites and little applicability in the workplace. According to The Crimson's news story, several classics concentrators interviewed by The Crimson cited their study of the field in high school as the motivating factor for choosing it as their concentration. To the Classics Department’s credit, Director of Undergraduate Studies Kathleen M. Coleman told The Crimson that she hopes more students without previous exposure will consider concentrating in classics. Departments suffering from such homogeneity—frequently in the liberal arts, as described by Pinkser—should follow CS50’s lead in attracting a diverse group of students while still maintaining the academic rigor required of a Harvard education.
Practically, this goal means that academic departments must provide adequate information to all potential concentrations about what it really means to concentrate in that field. Dispelling the myth that English concentrators are doomed for unemployment is just as important as framing economics as a concentration that does not necessitate a career in finance. Every concentration offered at Harvard has unique benefits and drawbacks. The University would be well served to ensure that individual academic departments do their part in making every concentration open to every student.

Breasts are everywhere. It’s impossible to look at a magazine, advertisement, television commercial, or movie without seeing a pair of breasts on display. The reason isn’t exactly a mystery: People, especially heterosexual men, enjoy looking at breasts.
But at the same time, women are also told to hide their breasts. Dress codes that permit men to wear revealing tops or no tops at all often prohibit women from showing cleavage. Breastfeeding mothers are told to cover up in restaurants for being inappropriate. Female nipples are banned on Instagram, while male nipples are allowed.
People get titillated by breasts and enjoy looking at them or masturbating to them, but they simultaneously scowl at the women whom these breasts belong to, deriding them as inappropriate or pathetic and telling them to put their breasts away. In this twisted love-hate relationship that society has with female breasts, women are told that their breasts are valued and attractive, but also shameful and best covered up. We may think we have progressed enormously from the time when women had to cover their ankles in public, but it seems that not much has changed after all.
The classic argument is that breasts are sexual, and that flaunting them about in public is just as inappropriate as a man swinging his penis around. Some on the Internet have even reasoned that breastfeeding in public is comparable to a man taking out his penis and “feeding” his wife or girlfriend in public. After all, breasts are in the same category as genitals and therefore subject to the same taboos. Children’s eyes should be covered in the presence of bare breasts, or even cleavage. Katy Perry was supposed to guest star on Sesame Street, but the clip never aired because parents didn’t want their children seeing her cleavage.
There is one glaring problem with this line of reasoning. Breasts are not sexual organs. They’re just secondary sex characteristics. These are features that appear during puberty that, unlike the sex organs, are not directly part of the reproductive system. Just like wide hips and pubic hair, full breasts signify sexual maturation for women. Men experience secondary sex characteristics too, such as facial hair, the Adam’s apple, and vocal deepening. But nobody would think to shame men for exposing their Adam’s apples.
But then again, nobody experiences sexual arousal from seeing someone’s Adam’s apple—or at least, very few people do. On the contrary, the argument goes, human males are evolutionarily wired to experience sexual arousal from seeing breasts. Therefore, breasts are indeed sexual, and should be covered up in public—especially at work, in school, or in front of children.
While it is true that in our society, more people are turned on by breasts than by Adam’s apples, that is not a biological trait but a cultural one. Western society is actually unique in its fetishization of breasts. In societies in parts of Africa and the South Pacific, women regularly walk around with their breasts uncovered and their men are utterly indifferent. It appears that, contrary to popular belief, men are not biologically wired to get excited from seeing breasts.
Can it really be that our sexualization of breasts is more cultural than biological? Take a look at China, a society that once treated feet the same way we treated breasts. In China, women used to bind their feet to abnormally small sizes for men’s sexual pleasure. Chinese men described the little feet as producing a “voluptuous feeling” and even admitted to having “evil thoughts” upon looking at a woman’s foot.
And yet, a Westerner would be hard-pressed to make an argument that, just because men are sexually excited by feet and receive sexual stimulation from foot play, feet are inherently sexual. So why would we argue that, for those same reasons, breasts are inherently sexual?
Nature did not intend for breasts to be sexual. Nature intended for breasts to provide nourishment for offspring. This seems obvious, but it somehow never comes up in these conversations about whether breasts are sexual or not. For people who regularly invoke the biological argument to defend their claim that breasts are inappropriate and sexual, opponents of public breastfeeding seem to have missed an introductory course on human biology.
This is exactly why the controversy over breasts is utterly preposterous. Parents argue that Katy Perry’s cleavage is inappropriate for young children to see, forgetting that breasts were evolutionarily designed to feed young children. People forget that breasts were not biologically intended to give men hard-ons; they were biologically intended to produce milk for babies.
And yet, we live in a society where breasts are conspicuously displayed in advertisements and movies for men to gawk at, but mothers are forced to feed their hungry babies secretly in bathroom stalls. We live in a society that believes that female breasts exist only for male pleasure.
There’s nothing wrong with getting sexual pleasure from seeing breasts, but there’s everything wrong with having a man’s erection get in the way of a mother trying to breastfeed her child, or a woman wearing a low-cut top, or a woman wearing no top at all.
Our breasts are not for your pleasure. We are not for your pleasure. It’s about time we treat women as individuals with needs and desires of their own, rather than just objects satisfying the needs and desires of men.

Among the perennial philosophic debates of the past two hundred years, the question of who should put down the toilet seat has a special, special place. The burden of this maximum half-calorie burning motion is a trivial topic, but somehow it becomes the subject of passionate, often gender-divided disputes.
If you’ve never seen one, it looks like this: The issue comes up and light chuckles follow. To almost everyone, it is perfectly clear what should be done. But the problem is that half the people think that men should put the seat down, and the other half disagree.
Now, the Leave-Uppers mention reason and efficiency. The Put-Downers retort with appeals to bathroom aesthetics and being considerate of women. Horror stories about falling into the toilet arise. If the poor toilet seat hadn’t taken in enough shit already, suddenly gender scripts come up. There is talk of how chivalry is dead and rebuttals questioning why men should do the dirty work.
The innocent conversation elevates to canonical themes. Logic versus aesthetics, efficiency versus courtesy, diametric views about gender roles. The two sides talk past one another. An impasse forms.
I think we “inefficient” Put-Downers can end this stalemate by making a gambit. Let’s toss out our arguments about the sublime beauty of a seat lying orthogonal to the wall (and covering up the sight of yellow stains and curly hairs), and our appeals to courtesy. Let’s concede that cold, dispassionate logic should be the sole adjudicator of the debate. If we can do that and then show that reason actually favors the set down seat, the Leave-Uppers won’t have any platform to sit on.
The Leave-Uppers reason with two compelling principles:
1. PRINCIPLE OF TOILET ENERGY EFFICIENCY: We ought to minimize the total energy expenditure of toilet usage movements.
To see how this works, suppose that person #1 is a guy and goes number one, so raises the seat. #2 follows. If #2 needs the seat down, he’ll either lower the seat if #1 left it up, or exert no energy if #1 put it down. In both cases there is one seat lowering motion. However, if #2 needs the seat up, he’ll have to lift the seat if #1 put it down (meaning that both #1’s lowering and #2’s lifting were unnecessary), or do nothing if #1 left it up. So, the leave-up strategy is logically guaranteed to yield a total energy expenditure that is less than or equal to the put-down strategy in every permutation. (It should be clear how inefficient the “leave-it-how-you-found-it” strategy is.) Aren’t we already fighting hard enough against entropy?
2. PRINCIPLE OF POTTY EQAULITY: To be fair, we ought to distribute lavatory benefits that are unevenly distributed beyond people’s control.
Again, the Leave-Uppers win. Nobody chose what body they were born into, so nobody chose their biological waste system. The Leave-Uppers argue that guys shouldn’t have to bear the double-burden of lifting and lowering. They didn’t choose to have what’s down there, so why do the girls get to run with their luck?
This Leave-Upperian two-pronged attack looks strong. But it carries a sneaky background assumption that is outright false: It presupposes that men can’t pee sitting down.
As someone who’s (admittedly) done this before, it is possible. Moreover, there are several good reasons for doing it: Reducing the risk of splash back; preventing a yellow-stained rim (or floor, if you’re terrible); and not worrying about aim or split-streaming (girls, don’t ask). If that wasn’t enough, research shows that men with urinary tract problems empty their bladders more efficiently when sitting.
But these are side perks. The mere fact that guys can pee sitting down has drastic consequences for the two Leave-Upperian principles. It means that the Pareto pee-ers are simply mistaken thinking that the leave-up strategy is energy-efficient. If they want waste less energy, they should just sit down—the toilet seat would never move. (And if you get nitty-gritty about guys needing to pull their pants down when they sit, I think the energy saved by sitting instead of standing would compensate that). So if a guy lifts the seat, he is not following the energy efficiency principle—and so cannot appeal to it.
The second principle’s all that’s left. Or is it? Given that guys don’t need to stand, lifting the seat is not an unfair male burden; rather, it is a privilege that is unavailable to women. If we want to talk about fairness, we should realize that it is men, not women, who were given a benefit (of choice) when it comes to peeing. Men may stand for whatever perks it has (say, convenience), but they should recognize that these perks aren’t open to women—and so assume the cost associated with their exclusive benefit.
Guys should recognize that while they have the choice to sit down, girls do not have the choice to stand up. This means both that the efficient thing to do is to sit down, and, if they choose to stand, that the fair thing to do is to lower the seat. So, if you stand up to pee, be a stand up guy about your privileges. Remember that there are simply no good reasons for leaving the seat up. Whether you’re moved by aesthetics, efficiency, courtesy, or equality, put the seat down after you tinkle.
And please, wash your hands too.

The Kennedy School of Government has received two significant gifts, $2 million from the Mallinckrodt Foundation and $2.93 million from the Charles Koch Foundation, that will go toward establishing student fellowships.
The Mallinckrodt gift, which has been endowed in perpetuity, will fund a fellowship for one mid-career MPA student at the Kennedy School each year starting in September 2016. The Koch Foundation gift is a three-year commitment that will fund five master’s degree fellowships, two doctoral fellowships, and additional visiting scholar positions in the Kennedy School’s Program on Education Policy and Governance, according to program director and Government professor Paul E. Peterson.
“The goal is to foster interest in the field of education entrepreneurship and provide help to young people who are pursuing degree programs in this area,” Peterson said. “We’re hopeful that this is the beginning of a relationship that will be going on for many years.”
The Koch gift, according to Charles Koch Foundation director of university relations John Hardin, came out of conversations between a Harvard graduate working at the foundation and a Harvard professor.
“When Harvard began asking us about supporting this program that helped students and scholars to better understand ways to better provide education, so it can have those opportunities to improve their own lives, we were excited to engage in that conversation,” Hardin said.
Charles G. Koch—who also co-founded the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank—and his brother David H. Koch have drawn some scrutiny for the close to $900 million spending target their political network set earlier this year. A movement dubbed “UnKoch My Campus” has pushed back against donations from the Charles Koch Foundation to various colleges and universities nationwide.
The gifts come to the Kennedy School as it continues to fundraise as part of its segment of Harvard’s capital campaign, which has a public goal of $6.5 billion. The Kennedy School had raised $460 million toward its own goal of $500 million by late September. It had raised almost $100 million toward the campaign priority devoted to student “support” initiatives and fellowships, according to acting dean Archon Fung.
In a November interview, Fung emphasized that the school will place importance on endowing more fellowships and professorships in the second phase of the school’s campaign, which will begin when former Congressional Budget Office director Douglas W. Elmendorf assumes the deanship on Jan. 1.
“The gap between private sector remuneration and people doing public work is growing…and that creates enormous pressures, and so we want to do whatever we can on the financial aid side,” Fung said at the time. “It is our mission to enable people to pursue public careers in the broad sense—public leadership and solving public problems, and financial aid is a critical piece of enabling people to do that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Claudia Escobar, a fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, spoke about her personal journey fighting against corruption in her home country of Guatemala in front of a packed audience Wednesday afternoon at Fay House.
Escobar’s talk, “The Relation among Judicial Independence, Separation of Powers, and Corruption,” is one in a series of fellows’ lectures presented by the Radcliffe Institute. As part of her fellowship, she is pursuing a research project on corruption’s negative effect on judicial independence in Guatemala.
“As we all know, the government has certain obligations over the citizens,” Escobar said. “Among these, they should guarantee security and justice for all. If the institutions that are in charge of these important tasks do not do their job, then the rule of law is an empty concept.”
According to Escobar, the process of electing magistrates in Guatemala has been largely tainted by “corrupt politicians, drug lords, and unethical lawyers.” Resigning from her position as judge in light of issues she saw in the judicial system, Escobar has moved on to lead a movement for judicial independence by forming a legal opinion on the unconstitutionality of the election process.
Though a court ruled against Escobar’s position near the end of 2014, her crusade against corruption brought about protests earlier this year that culminated in the resignation of Guatemalan president Otto Pérez Molina in September. Molina currently awaits trial for his involvement in a multimillion dollar customs fraud scheme.
But according to Escobar, challenges are still ongoing. She predicts that once the newly-elected President Jimmy Morales takes over in January, protests will resume.
“It’s not going to be easy. I think that people know that change doesn’t take months—sometimes it takes years,” she said. “I think we are at a turning point where we can build a full democracy, or we can become a failed state.”
Several audience members said they were inspired by Escobar’s bravery in fighting against corruption.
“All the protests got going because of her courage,” said Felipe Lara, another Radcliffe fellow. “She put her life in jeopardy, and her family, and obviously her career.”
“Corruption is a major problem. It’s a major concern for any democracy, not just Latin American democracies,” added Arlinda Shtuni, a local resident who frequents the presentations given by Radcliffe Institute fellows. “And here’s someone who sees that and confronts it—she obviously stood up to it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As college students across the country stage protests in response to race-related incidents on their campuses, some cultural student groups at Harvard are planning to form a coalition “to present demands to the administration.”
According to an email sent last Sunday to “leaders of [People of Color] organizations on campus,” a group of students planned to meet last Monday to gauge interest in formulating “a list of collective demands” and “executing the associated action together with other students of color.”
“As students of color across the nation rise up and demand to be heard, seen, and safe on their own campuses, we agreed that we, as students of color, must take advantage of this window of opportunity to bring much-needed structural changes to our own campus,” said the email, signed by two students.
It remains unclear what happened at that meeting, or what specific requests students might make of administrators; several cultural group leaders did not respond to requests for comment.
But sent at the tail end of a semester that featured a string of high-profile racially charged incidents, at Harvard and other universities, the message made clear that students hoped to meet at least partly in response to recent events.
In particular, the coordinating email referenced waves of activism at Princeton, Yale, Occidental College, and Brandeis, where students have staged sit-ins and marched to demand an end to racism and increase support for students of color there.
The email also referenced a recent incident at Harvard Law School, where black professors’ portraits were covered in black tape last month in what police are investigating as a hate crime. 
In the email’s body, meeting organizers noted that members of Renegade, a student publication that focuses on issues of diversity and identity among students of color, held a “solidarity meeting” on the same day as the Law School incident. That meeting became an “action planning session,” at least in part because of the incident, according to the email.
Law School administrators, including Dean Martha L. Minow, have responded to the vandalism incident by hosting community meetings to discuss racism at the school, which Minow herself recently deemed a “serious problem.”
Also last month, students from the Concilio Latino, an undergraduate cultural group, presented a list of demands to University President Drew G. Faust. They asked that Harvard designate one floor of the Smith Campus Center, which will soon undergo renovation, as a space for students of color; allocate more funds to cultural and ethnic student groups; and double the number of proctors and tutors who come from diverse cultural backgrounds.
Among their requests was that Harvard rename the College’s House master position, a title that some students criticize as associated with slavery. On Tuesday, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said the masters of Harvard’s 12 undergraduate Houses “unanimously” agreed to change their title, though they have not yet decided on a replacement term. Both Faust and Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith have signaled their approval for the change.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 4, 2015, at 12:55 a.m.
On paper, economics professor Jeremy C. Stein can come off as intimidating.
A research economist at the forefront of his field, an advisor in the U.S. Treasury Department following the 2008 financial crisis, and—most recently—a governor on the Federal Reserve Board, Stein’s list of accomplishments is formidable.
But take a step into his office, and any traces of initial intimidation dissolve with one look at his welcoming smile. Talk to him for a few minutes, and it becomes clear that his most natural profession is that of an enthusiastic mentor.
Stein’s 15 years as a Harvard faculty member have been interrupted recently by a fair amount of time off during which he pursued opportunities away from the classroom. But after these breaks, he always returns to his office at the Littauer Center for Economics, equipped with a whole new palette of experiences to recolor his curriculum.
A LIFE'S WORK
Stein’s long career in economics began in his undergraduate days at Princeton University, where he was an economics major. For a few summers, he worked at a small savings and loan company in New Jersey. During his senior year, Stein was drawn to a PhD-level finance course taught by economics professor Albert “Pete” Kyle.
“I was woefully in over my head in the course,” Stein said. “I was probably the only undergraduate in his class, and [Kyle] went out of his way to be nice. That makes a huge difference.”
Stein said Kyle was an influential mentor, encouraging Stein to apply to graduate school—a decision that, even today, is the less-trodden path for undergraduates pursuing finance. During graduate school, Stein interned at the Federal Reserve for a summer, unaware that he would one day be sworn in as a governor in that very place.
After serving as an assistant professor in finance at Harvard Business School and then teaching at Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management for 10 years, Stein joined the Harvard economics department in 2000. In that position, Stein said he has appreciated the flexibility with which he can mold his own curriculum.
“The great thing here is I can teach a course that’s the stuff I know the best, and I’m able to be most enthusiastic and excited about, and still draw an audience of fifty people,” Stein said.
Stein noted that he enjoyed the small size of his undergraduate classes, an environment in which he could get to know students on a more personal level. Benjamin A. Scharfstein ’16, a student in Stein’s class last spring, described the thoroughness and patience with which Stein interacted with his students.
“He listened to what everyone said, and he was very open to having engaged conversations,” said Scharfstein, a former Crimson editor. “And even if what the person said was off-topic or unrelated, he would really engage with that and try to push back.”
In addition to teaching undergraduate and PhD classes, Stein also served as an advisor for doctoral students. These students—a number of whom now teach at Harvard Business School—also praised Stein’s knack for engaging with students.
“You can have an objectively terrible idea, and go and talk to him about it, and he will reshape it into the Venus de Milo,” said Adi V. Sunderam, an assistant professor at the Business School and Stein’s former advisee. “He is very good at taking some deep kernel of an idea that you didn’t even realize that you had, isolating that piece, and throwing out the less relevant parts.”
IN THE DEPTHS OF THE CRISIS
In late December 2008, President Obama had just been sworn in, the economy was in a downward spiral, financial markets were in shambles, and Stein received an urgent phone call from Lawrence H. Summers, a former University president who was then the Director of the Obama administration's National Economic Council in the Obama administration.
Summers asked Stein to help with a team working on the bank policy during the country’s worst financial crisis in decades. After his request to take a semester-long leave from Harvard was granted, Stein flew down to D.C. to assist in a six month-long group effort to contain the banking crisis. For Stein, the endeavor was both daunting and exciting.
Samuel G. Hanson, an assistant professor at the Business School and former advisee of Stein, also took a break from his graduate studies in 2009 to work in the Treasury Department alongside his mentor.
“Getting the opportunity to work side by side with Professor Stein and see the way he approached these problems was just tremendously useful and rewarding,” Hanson said. “I’ve always been impressed with the way that he approaches policy questions with an open mind.”
Stein’s career in economic policy took an even greater leap in 2011 when President Obama nominated him for a governor position on the seven-member Federal Reserve Board.
“There was a part of me I think that had always hoped that I would get the chance to do something like this,” Stein said. “And it was great. It was probably the two best years of my professional life.”
While on the Federal Reserve Board, Stein worked not only with monetary policy but also with post-crisis bank regulation and prevention. Stein resigned two years later to preserve his tenured professorship at Harvard, looking forward to applying his new knowledge to the classroom.
“Part of the reason I was very excited to come back and to teach this class was to try to put some of this into the course.” Stein said.
BACK HOME IN THE CLASSROOM
In the fall 2014, Jeremy Stein returned to his office in Littauer after his two year hiatus and traded shaping economic policy for lecturing to students, ready to teach a revamped version of his undergraduate economics course.
“On the one hand, being away is very good...the topics I worked on were incredibly interesting and good fodder for getting ideas I wanted to work on,” Stein said. “On the other hand, you’re just away from the game for a couple of years, so it’s like anything, you get a little rusty.”
Sunderam, his former advisee, noted the benefits of being taught by a professor with Stein’s amount of hands-on finance experience.
“Having the background of having really been there fighting in the trenches gives you a little bit more insight into what are the most relevant issues and what kind of problems should I be thinking about as first order,” Sunderam said. “Jeremy was a very, very good economist before any of this stuff happened, but I think if anything, those experiences help.”
Stein said his biggest takeaway from working during the financial crisis was that he learned traditional individualistic approaches to finance do not always result in macro economic sustainability. Stein worked on incorporating this idea into his undergraduate finance course curriculum.
“I think I used to just think about the individual markets a little bit more in their own right,” Stein said. “I think all of us, or many of us, now try to think a little bit more of what you might call a systemic perspective.”
Hence, the title of his new undergraduate class: The Financial System and the Central Bank. Scharfstein said he valued Stein’s perspectives and opinions on hotly contested issues.
“A lot of the benefit of the class for me was just hearing him talk about the things that you don’t read,” Scharfstein said. “Things that you can’t really learn from just any professor, that you can really only learn from about five or ten people in the world.”
Stein explained how despite his efforts to attract a broad range of students, including those with an interest in policy, the class tended to draw “hard-core finance banker types,” due to the high level of readings and concepts.
“I always wanted [on] the margin for the class to be a little bit bigger and a little bit more inclusive,” Stein said. “I would love to draw people who are a little bit outside of the standard issue econ thing.”
Stein’s positive disposition can be seen in every facet of his life, whether he is presenting a lecture, giving research advice, or speaking in a high profile meeting.
“Like many Harvard faculty, [Stein] is very smart. He’s very optimistic, which is a little bit less common,” Sunderam said. “They call economics the dismal science, but he’s the happiest, most optimistic person I know.”

Roughly 30 undergraduates filled the Barker Center Cafe on Wednesday evening to listen to the two premiere episodes of “This Harvard Life,” a student-produced podcast that explores what it means to be a member of the Harvard community.
Loosely based on the NPR series “This American Life,” the podcast was co-produced by Wynne M. Graham ’17, Kelly C. McGee ’17 , Ruby C. Emberling ’17, and Alison B. Reed ’17, who said they conceived the idea for the series last year and started production after peers encouraged them.
The first two episodes, which featured music from Harvard affiliates, explored the role that an individual’s own name plays in building social connections at Harvard and the origins of cultural beliefs, respectively.
The producers tentatively plan to release two podcasts of between 15 and 20 minutes each month, Graham said at the event. The podcast’s production is funded by the Harvard Bookstore, rather than Harvard itself, specifically to keep the podcast independent from the University, she said.
“We love telling stories,” Graham said. “We are talking to people about stories, what it means to be a person in this place in this world.”
During the event, attendees enjoyed J.P. Licks pastries and hot chocolate and participated in a bingo game based on quotes from the podcast. The producers also distributed Post-It notes, asking students to write down ideas for future episodes.
Noah A. Fechtor-Pradines ’18 said the organizers did a “fantastic job” and that the podcast “sounded professional,” praising the structure and clarity of the episodes.
“I listened to podcasts in high school, but that was stuff that didn’t necessarily relate to me,” Julia Davis ’19 said. “It was cool to listen to a podcast that explored things that are more relevant to me.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The muffled sounds of chatter and whirring coffee machines permeate the back room of Cafe Gato Rojo, where Shelby J. Martinez ’18 is sitting after finishing a two-hour shift at one of her three term-time jobs. She works a total of 10 to 15 hours a week at the Cafe, Eliot Grille, and Harvard Student Agencies.
Martinez, a Texas native who qualifies for the federal work study program, said she relies on her jobs to support herself, including to pay for books, pricey flights home, medical fees, and the many other small expenses that add up quickly. She often picks up shifts on Friday and Saturday nights that no one else wants, since she needs the money.
Her need to work, Martinez has found, has affected her Harvard experience significantly.
Camila Victoriano ’16, meanwhile, described her on-campus work experience as a stress reliever that takes her mind off of academics and the intensity of Harvard life. For six to eight hours a week since her freshman year, Victoriano has stood behind Lamont Library’s circulation desk, her hands moving methodically, opening each book, stamping it firmly, then closing it in a steady rhythm.
The contrast between Martinez’s and Victoriano’s stories highlight not only the variation in work experiences on Harvard’s campus, but also the different opinions that surround the term-time work expectation that is a long-standing component of Harvard financial aid. While some students find it a meaningful distraction and opportunity for learning, others describe it as a major burden that puts them at a disadvantage.
A LONG TRADITION
The expectation that students work during term-time is a central part of Harvard’s financial aid package—more than 70 percent of undergraduates have jobs, according to estimates by the Student Employment Office.
“We’ve always had it. We believe that students should invest in their own education,” said Sally C. Donahue, the College’s financial aid director. “Many of our donors were receiving financial aid themselves when they were in school, and many of them firmly believe that students benefit from having jobs on campus and from investing in their own education, and being part of this partnership that enables them to be here at Harvard.”
Still, although the term-time work expectation is far from new, it has evolved over the past few decades so that it has decreased in size substantially, according to Donahue.
Prior to 1998, Harvard expected students who received financial aid to work more hours than it does today; the College also asked students to contribute those earnings directly to tuition and fees. But thanks to financial aid reforms over the past two decades, Harvard now offers students significantly more grant aid and cut the term-time work expectation in half from $7,325 in 1998 to $3,375 today, according to Donahue. Tuition, meanwhile, has doubled. 
“I think a big concern going back in time was that we didn’t want to set up a situation that kept people from having the full experience if they were meeting their term-time work requirement,” Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 said.
Now, the College strongly advises students not to work more than 20 hours a week; according to Donahue, it calculates each year’s work expectation based on what students could expect to earn by working 10 to 12 hours.
Also a departure from previous years, Harvard expects students to use their term-time earnings to cover additional educational costs such as books, school supplies, and travel expenses, but not tuition and fees.
While the College’s Financial Aid Office outlines this requirement in student financial aid packages, it does not monitor whether students are actually working to fulfill it. The Student Employment Office, meanwhile, does not keep track of where individual students are working or for how long, but according to their aggregate statistics, 4,160 students on Harvard’s payroll earned a total of almost $9 million in the 2014-2015 academic year.
Dingman argued that the current work expectation fits into what he defines as a “manageable load”: “If you do one or two extracurricular activities, have some term-time employment, have a regular four-course load, keep up in your work outside of the classroom, get some sleep, have some time simply for down-time,” he said, “I think it makes for a full and interesting but manageable week.”
TRADE-OFFS  
Several students who work fewer than 10 hours per week agree with Dingman, but some who work more than that report a different experience: Their jobs, they say, prevent them from pursuing other activities on campus.
“I do feel that I am limited in terms of what I can actually do outside my employment. I only do one other club because I felt that that’s all I could take on,” said Devontae A. B. Freeland ’19, who works 10 to 15 hours a week total as a “Hahvahd” tour guide, an intern at the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, and an employee at the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies.
Students whose jobs align with their interests and ambitions find that working long hours is not a problem. Joao H. Vogel ’16, who said he prioritizes extracurricular commitments over academics, has found his jobs rewarding. Jarrod R. Wetzel-Brown ’17 described his jobs at the Center for Wellness and as a Peer Advising Fellow as extracurricular activities that just happen to be paid. And a select few extracurriculars on campus, including The Crimson, offer financial aid programs that pay participants with demonstrated need so they are not forced to face a difficult trade-off.
But for Martinez and students like her, unable to find such jobs but needing to fulfill their work expectations and support themselves, work means forgoing more time-intensive extracurricular activities and social opportunities that interest them.
Martinez said she would “love” to participate in club sports, investment organizations, or groups that require going through a long comp process. But her time spent working takes up the time she might spend on those activities.
“To me, it’s like the comp process for a lot of these organizations would be like another job, and because I already have one, I can’t add more to my plate,” she said. “When it comes to having extracurriculars and connections, which could make me either academically or professionally or socially better in the long run, versus having a job that I need to have to be able to pay for things right now in the present, I have to choose the job. So it’s a very long-term sacrifice so I can stay here in the present.” 
Gabby D. Aguirre ’17 works 20 to 30 hours a week at her three campus jobs to send money home to her family in times of economic hardship. That comes at the expense of her personal life, she says, adding that her situation is not unique: “A lot of people I work with are people who are on work study and who are working 20 to 30 hours a week,” she said. “A lot of us are kind of aware in terms of how it limits us in terms of social and academic opportunities.”
DIVERGING OPINIONS
Given the impact of long work hours on a college schedule, some students question whether Harvard’s term-time work expectation should exist at all. Some students argue that grant aid should expand to cover and eliminate the student work contribution altogether.
“I can say that the term-time work expectation in my case didn’t immediately feel ideal,” Freeland said. “My parents were talking about taking on extra hours to support that, and I didn’t want to force them to do that. It’s an added burden on students.”
Some students who work long hours say needing to work disadvantages them academically compared to their non-working classmates. Freeland said working three jobs during the day means that he cannot start studying until late at night; Aguirre described having much less time to devote to papers and problem sets and recalled seeing other students with the time and flexibility to attend last-minute study sessions or office hours performing better on assignments.
Martinez, who said she thinks the College should increase scholarships to eliminate its term-time work expectation, perceives dramatic disadvantages stemming from disparities in networks. Students who do not have to work term-time jobs have extra time to foster social and professional networks that working students lack, she said.
“A lot of your success in college and after you graduate depends on your connections and the people you know, more than it really is your aptitude,” she said.
Still, administrators maintain that the work expectation is an important part of its financial aid program: “I think Harvard has been a leader in enhancing its financial aid program to the point where we have ensured that Harvard is affordable for every student and family we admit. Could we go beyond this and eliminate jobs? There are always questions about that,” Donahue said. “We think jobs are important and we think a student contribution is important. Particularly if a student is receiving a very large grant of, say, $55,000 a year, to contribute a couple thousand out of earnings is really not an unreasonable expectation.”
Charlene S. Kim, the assistant director of financial aid for student employment, said College staff and alumni donors also feel that working provides students with valuable real-world experience, imparting professional development that will serve them in their careers. “It is supposed to be a part of the educational experience ultimately,” she said.
Students, too, all seemed to agree that their term-time jobs have taught them time-management and organizational skills they could not have learned in a classroom. Dorm Crew head captain Laura K. Brennan ’16 said dorm crew has easily been her most formative experience at Harvard, and she will use the organizational skills she acquired from it in her teaching career. And Adam R. Hotchkiss ’15-’16 said his management position at the Queen’s Head has taught him how to run a business.
Noemi Valdez ’19, a dorm crew worker, is also glad that the work expectation exists. “I don't like things being handed to me,” she said. “Working allows me to feel that I am also doing my part.”
The problem, Aguirre argued, is that wealthier students are exempted from this experience. Referencing an op-ed about why the wealthy should clean toilets, she proposed a more radical solution to even out the playing field.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Outside funding sources gave Harvard less than $800 million to fund research in the 2015 fiscal year for the first time since 2010, continuing a years-long decline, according to a recent report from the University’s Office for Sponsored Programs.
Research money that Harvard received from federal and non-federal sources combined fell by about $16 million, or 2 percent, to $795.7 million in the last fiscal year, according to the report released last month.
The report attributed $11 million of the $16 million decrease to the end of Harvard’s funding through the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, also known as the stimulus. According to the report, Harvard faculty received $245 million from the program and spent that money between fiscal years 2010 and 2015.
The report also details the state of Harvard’s research funding in the second full fiscal year of the federal government’s wide-ranging budget cuts known collectively as sequestration. Those cuts, enacted in March 2013, look to progressively trim a total of more than $1 trillion from federal programs over a decade.
Harvard has lobbied against such cuts, arguing that investing in research funding is critical. University President Drew G. Faust has repeatedly cautioned against sequestration and its impact on institutions of higher education; she dedicated her 2013 Commencement address to the subject.
As those cuts continued, funding from federal sources decreased by about $31 million, or 5 percent, to $577.5 million in fiscal year 2015, according to the report.
The Department of Health and Human Services, which includes the National Institutes of Health, was Harvard’s largest source of federal funding, giving the University $424.4 million. Its contributions have steadily declined over the past few years.
As federal funding continued to decline, Harvard saw an increase in research funding from non-federal outside sources in fiscal year 2015, by about 7 percent, bringing the total to $218.3 million.
The increase in non-federal funding, which represents money from foundations, research institutes, hospitals, universities, and other nonprofit organizations, follows a four-year trend. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation remains Harvard research’s largest non-federal sponsor by a “large margin,” according to the report.
Harvard’s Office for Sponsored Programs reported receiving fewer research proposals in fiscal year 2015, 3,972, compared to 4,108 in 2014. Harvard affiliates requested a larger total dollar amount, though—an increase of about $82 million in that same time.
Of the 10 Harvard schools that the report said have “active research projects,” Harvard Medical School and the School of Public Health together accounted for more than half of all research proposal submissions.
Harvard professors have previously voiced their concerns with the effects sequestration would have on their research, suggesting that the decrease in federal funding could prompt them to spend more time writing proposals for non-federal grants and less time actually conducting research.
In light of the downward trend of federal funding, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith said said the school has worked “very hard” so that professors can obtain research funding from sources such as corporations and foundations.
“It has been a purposeful approach to say that the environment out there is changing and we need to adapt some of our processes and help our faculty to continue to do the amazing work they do,” Smith said.
Smith said administrators in FAS, Harvard’s flagship faculty, are also looking to generate more internal funding for faculty research, such as from alumni.
Harvard’s ongoing capital campaign will support, among other priorities, faculty research. FAS’s portion of the University-wide fundraising drive has a public goal of $2.5 billion, and as of September, it had already raised $2.2 billion. About $541 million of that went toward a campaign priority devoted to professorships, fellowships, and research.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 4, 2015, at 6:21 p.m.
Legal counsel for a Harvard Law School student who was accused—but never found guilty in court—of sexually assaulting a fellow student and her friend have launched a website to publicly contest the portrayal of his case in the documentary film “The Hunting Ground.”
Released this spring, the documentary scrutinizes how university administrators have responded to sexual harassment, presenting testimonials of former students who charge that their schools mishandled sexual assault investigations. The film begins with Kamilah Willingham, a Harvard Law School alumna, saying that she and a friend were sexually assaulted by another student in her time at the school. 
The film criticizes that Harvard initially found the alleged perpetrator—named in press releases as Brandon J. Winston—guilty and handed down a sanction of dismissal, but faculty later reversed that decision. Winston was later investigated on related charges in criminal court and found guilty of non-sexual assault.
Last month, a group of 19 Law School professors slammed the documentary in a public letter, calling the film “an unfair and misleading portrayal of the facts” in the case. Now, Winston’s lawyers are publishing documentation to try to prove his innocence.
Their recently launched site—called “The Brandon Project”—presents court documents to show that a grand jury did not indict him on charges related to Willingham, and a jury exonerated Winston of the most serious charges in a trial involving Willingham’s unnamed friend. The site links to several hundred pages of legal documents that include witness testimonies from Winston and Willingham and photo exhibits from the cases.
Norman Zalkind, Winston’s attorney, said CNN’s decision to air the film nationally in late November motivated him to push back by creating the site, which also features testimonials from Winston’s parents and photographs from his childhood. Some Harvard Law School professors helped prepare content for the site, Zalkind said.
“We knew that CNN was coming out with the film and that they were publishing what we consider is not accurate about Kamilah and Brandon, and his case,” Zalkind said.  “We saw the film before and we knew it was coming out in a big way on CNN…. We had to prepare something.”
Willingham and “The Hunting Ground” film makers, however, criticized the site’s portrayal of Winston and the allegations against him. In an interview with The Crimson, Willingham said the documentary accurately represents her case and said the site from Winston’s legal team struck her as “absurd.” She argued that the site focuses too heavily on the criminal process proceedings as a way to justify the Law School’s separate investigatory process.
“They are separate processes for a reason,” Willingham said. “But I also just think it’s absurd that they’re treating the criminal process as if it is infallible.”
In an emailed statement, “The Hunting Ground” director Kirby Dick and producer Amy Ziering also denounced the website from Winston’s legal team.
“It’s a slick and sad attempt to mislead the public and blame the victim,” they wrote.
They also criticized the Law School professors, many of whom have been vocal critics of Harvard’s recently overhauled approach to handling sexual harassment cases, for their letter critiquing the film.
“The Harvard Law professors’ letter is irresponsible and raises an important question about whether the very public bias these professors have shown in favor of an assailant contributes to a hostile climate at Harvard Law,” Dick and Ziering wrote.
The federal Department of Education found the Law School in violation of gender equity law Title IX in 2014. While documentation about how sexual assault charges against Winston played out in the courts are now widely available, many details about the Law School’s own investigation—a focus of criticism in the film—remain under wraps. Neither the film nor Winston’s legal team have shared documents detailing Law School professors’ decision to allow Winston to return to campus in full publicly.
Law School professors reviewed the Administrative Board’s initial findings and determined they were not supported by “substantial evidence,” according to an email posted on “The Brandon Project” website between Ellen M. Cosgrove, the Law School’s former dean of students, and Winston.
Janet E. Halley, one of the 19 Law School professors who denounced the film in the recent public letter, later defended the actions she and other professors are taking to challenge the movie, denying that they contribute to a hostile environment. “What it really means is that they don’t want the debate,” she said.
Halley said restrictions from the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act limited Law professors’ involvement in “The Brandon Project” site.
“There was very little that we could do because all the things that we know about the Harvard Law proceedings are covered...by FERPA and faculty confidentiality rules,” Halley said.
Still, Halley praised the site and argued that viewers of the “The Hunting Ground” can now review allegations against Winston and compare them to court documents. Halley said she also placed the case documents in the Harvard Law School library for others to view.
On Tuesday, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences listed “The Hunting Ground” as one of 15 films shortlisted for nomination in the documentary feature award category.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Upon entering Houghton Library, students are greeted by the vast archival resources that the library has to offer. The lobby features books in glass cases that several hundred years old, and the marble floors and spiral staircase gives the building a modest opulence.
Worn leather-bound books line the illuminated shelves in the Edison and Newman Room to the left of the foyer. Some reach back into the 1400s and feature names like Dante, Virgil, Ptolmey, and Homer.
According to Houghton librarians, however, these resources are often under-utilized. Emilie Hardman, the research, instruction, and digital initiatives librarian there, says undergraduates do not often take the initiative to use Houghton resources for their own projects.
Hardman said that while many professors bring their classes to look at course-related material, students rarely came back to use collections at Houghton on their own.
“We thought that that was such a missed opportunity,” she said. “We wanted to be explicit that the Houghton is as much the undergraduate’s library as Lamont or Widener and say, ‘Here are the most amazing collections you can imagine, and you can do something with them’.”
To make the library’s resources seem more approachable, Hardman and Heather G. Cole, the assistant curator of modern books and manuscripts, launched the Houghton Undergraduate Summer Fellowship, a program designed to prompt undergraduates to engage with the Houghton’s vast collection and explore their scholarly curiosities.
A NEW SUMMER OPPORTUNITY
In contrast to many of the other research opportunities at Harvard, the Houghton fellowship is more flexible and open-ended. Projects are student-driven, and participants plan and pursue their own research.
“We wanted to create an opportunity that, one, was not structured by someone else, that was driven by students’ curiosity and [was] engaged with these materials that tell the stories of the world, and two, we wanted it to be exploratory,” Hardman said.
Hardman and Cole wanted to create a unique summer experience that would combine campus resources, the expansive breadth of the Houghton collection, and the power of student initiative.
“We know that there are a lot of opportunities for students in the summer, competitive opportunities,” Cole said, elaborating that she thinks the Houghton fellowship provides an experience as enriching and prestigious as other programs.
One aspect of the fellowship that is attractive to students is the stipend for research funding.
Last year, the stipend was $3,500, but this year the fellowship will provide even more resources by partnering with the Summer Humanities and Arts Program, which is run by the Harvard Undergraduate Office of Research and Fellowships. Due to administrative changes for this partnership, the 2016 application is due February 18, earlier than the previous year.
“This year’s Houghton fellows will not only be supported by the stipend but also have housing on campus and access to the research community that SHARP builds,” Hardman said.
Additionally, Cole said the fellowship connects students to the broader research community as scholars come from around the world to use Houghton’s collections.
Houghton was able to fund three fellows this past summer, and Hardman said she hopes the program can accept more in the future.
As of now, however, the fellowship is not formally funded by a specific office or organization. As Hardman put it, the funding came from the “library budget version of couch change grabbing. We shook out the cushions and put it together.”
Along with two letters of recommendation, the application consists of a project proposal and an explanation of how the collections will be used since engagement with the materials is at the core of the program, Hardman said.
An ideal applicant would be one willing to enthusiastically dive into a realm of what Hardman refers to as “creative scholarship.”
‘CREATIVE SCHOLARSHIP’
The term “creative scholarship” seems to perfectly encapsulate the final products. The inaugural group of fellows created a diverse array of original work with the archival material they used: A series of podcasts, an opera based on the life of Alice James, and a report exploring the divergence of birth control movements in the United States and United Kingdom.
Virginia R. Marshall ’15 created a podcast series about the life of several writers and their works. Her project, entitled “Reel Writing: Poems and prose off and on the tape reel,” also used recordings from the Woodberry Poetry Room.
“I had an incredible amount of freedom to be seized by a topic and delve as deeply as I saw fit into the story,” said Marshall, a former Crimson Arts editor.
Marshal discussed the excitement of handling historical objects that belonged to the famous writers she was researching, such as butterflies Nabokov painted on the backs of envelopes.
“I was also surprised to learn the kind of spell-binding pull an object can have over the researcher,” she said. “It's hard to describe the quiet thrill of holding a letter that one of your literary idols wrote, and seeing the places where they crossed a word out or doodled in the margins.”
Similarly, Jake H. Wilder-Smith ’16, who constructed an opera based on correspondence between Alice James—the sister of writer Henry James—and her family, was also inspired by the voices he was studying.
In a presentation about his project, Wilder-Smith said that he was forced “to consider what it means to adapt a text, to formulate a character, to build a voice from the words someone leaves behind, to compose an opera that merges my words and language with theirs, and places my melodies in their voices.”
INCREASING APPROACHABILITY
The Undergraduate Fellowship is part of a larger, growing effort to encourage students to become more familiar with the Houghton’s resources and to increase the library’s visibility on campus.
“We have a lot of knowledgeable staff who are really happy to talk to students about projects”, Cole said. “We just want to make sure that students know that we are here to help with research and curiosity.”
Additionally, Cole and Hardman said they plan to run a user survey for the first time in almost three decades in order to better understand how to enhance their ability to serve the needs of students.
“We are thinking strategically and programmatically about things we might do that would get people out of the curated class environment and work with their own interests,” Hardman said.
These efforts aim to keep undergraduates from feeling overwhelmed by Harvard’s massive library collection.
“People start to see the scope of what’s in front of them and back away in horror,” Hardman said.
The fellowship, along with a little help navigating the collections, might make the shelves lined with Homer and Virgil less intimidating.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 2, 2015, at 11:40 p.m.
BOSTON—Neither the Harvard defense nor two lengthy delays to repair a malfunctioning shot clock could slow down a hot-shooting Northeastern offense on Wednesday night. The Huskies (6-1) opened up a big second-half lead to cruise to a 80-71 victory over the Crimson (2-5) on a night where the hosts shot 43 percent from the field and made 10 three-pointers.
The first half was by far Harvard’s most productive half of the season offensively as the team shot 62 percent from the field, but turnovers and uncharacteristically weak defense plagued the Crimson.
“I thought we saw some steps forward from where we’ve been and some encouraging things that we were able to see here tonight,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “Certainly they are a good basketball team and deserved to win.”
A layup by Northeastern senior guard David Walker to beat the halftime buzzer put the Huskies up four, and the hosts never looked back. After the Crimson made 17 of its first 24 field goal attempts, Northeastern began to look more like the team that beat then-No. 15 Miami on the road last week. The Huskies outscored Harvard 50-33 in game’s final 24:14 and forced a total of 15 Crimson turnovers on the evening.
With the referees calling a tight game, Harvard picked up 13 team fouls in the first half, forcing Amaker to tinker with his traditional rotation. Nonetheless, freshman forward Weisner Perez and senior forward Patrick Steeves willed the Crimson to a nine-point lead with 6:47 to go in the first half. The duo, which had combined for all of 95 collegiate minutes before Wednesday, registered a total of 26 points and seven rebounds in 39 minutes.
“[Pat]’s playing with a sense of urgency, being a senior and a guy who hasn’t played much in his career due to injuries, so I think every bit of time that he gets is very meaningful for him,” Amaker said.
“Weisner in particular was pretty productive for us,” he added. “Thirteen points in 12 minutes. That’s pretty darn good for a guy coming off the bench and being a freshman.”
Two Northeastern runs, however, headlined the first 20 minutes. The first, an 8-2 outburst, cut the Harvard lead to three with 3:46 remaining in the frame before a separate 9-0 run to end the half put the game out of the Crimson’s reach for good.
Senior guard Quincy Ford led the Huskies with 22 points and 10 rebounds, but it was Northeastern’s balance that doomed Harvard as five different Huskies tallied eight or more points. The 43 percent shooting clip, 10 three-pointers, and 80 points are all season-highs for a Crimson opponent this season.
For the second game in a row, freshman guard Corey Johnson struggled to find his rhythm offensively. Johnson finished with three points on just one-for-seven shooting in 23 minutes. The first-year was held to six points in Sunday’s loss to Holy Cross after having averaged nearly 10 points through the team’s first five games.
After the Huskies set the tone following intermission with success in their inside-out game, Northeastern capitalized on the spaced out Harvard defense to dominate the glass and the paint for the rest of the evening. The Huskies finished with 38 rebounds, including 14 on the offensive glass. After Northeastern grew its lead to 17 before the under-four media timeout, the Crimson ended the game on a 13-5 run.
“I think Harvard is one of the best defensive teams that we’ve faced,” Northeastern coach Bill Coen said. “They’re just so sound fundamentally on that end of the floor. We were just fortunate, I thought, on the offensive end. We made a lot of threes, and we were aggressive going to the basket and made our free throws.”
Sparking the late surge for Harvard were junior forward Zena Edosomwan and freshman point guard Tommy McCarthy. The junior finished the game with 18 points and seven rebounds, but only one came on the offensive end, and Edosomwan only went to the line once.
As a team, the Crimson took just eight free throws attempts and converted only three for the second straight game. No Harvard guard went to the line on Wednesday. For the season, the team is shooting just 57 percent from the charity stripe.
McCarthy had nine assists to go along with eight points on 3-for-5 shooting. The nine dimes were a career high-for the freshman on a night where the Crimson logged 25 assists on its 31 made field goals.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After winning two of three games against ranked opponents last week, the No. 7/8 Harvard women’s ice hockey (8-2-1, 5-1-1 ECAC) returns to conference play this weekend against Princeton (7-4-1, 3-4-1) and No. 4/4 Quinnipiac (11-1-3, 6-1-2).
Heading into the weekend, Harvard has continued to rack up wins in both league and non-conference play. Though the Crimson dropped its first game since Oct. 23 last week when it lost, 4-2, to Minnesota Duluth, the team finished the week with a 2-1 record after defeating then-No. 4/4 Northeastern, 3-0, as well as UMD in the second game of their weekend series.
“We have played tough ranked opponents and faired well thus far, so we feel good about these couple games,” junior defender Abbey Frazer said.
Recently, the team put together a winning streak of seven games before the loss to UMD, and the team is now finding some cohesion as the season progresses.
“I think [seniors] Jessica Harvey and Miye D'Oench have been playing well up front, especially with Miye scoring some key goals,” Frazer said.
“We feel confident with all our goalies no matter who's in net, but [co-captain] Emerance Maschmeyer has been solid and giving us every opportunity to win,” she added.
Led by Maschmeyer, the Crimson’s steadfast defense has also played an important role in the team’s recent success. Maschmeyer is ranked second in the nation in save percentage, and the team is ranked third in the nation in goals allowed per game. Additionally, Harvard is ranked top five in penalty kill percentage.
“I think our defense as a whole has really been huge for us lately,” D’Oench said.
This road trip, featuring back-to-back games against ECAC opponents, will provide a test for the Crimson, as the Tigers and the Bobcats both have winning records and rank among the ECAC’s top five teams in the standings.
Last year, the Crimson fared very well against these two opponents. In four meetings with Quinnipiac, Harvard won them all, including a 5-0 shutout in the quarterfinals of the NCAA tournament at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center. The Crimson split its two games against Princeton, winning the first matchup at home, 3-0, before losing the second contest on the road, 1-0.
All of Princeton’s losses this season have come in league play so far, and the Tigers have struggled to consistently win games as of late. They handily defeated RIT in two games last weekend by a combined score of 10-1 but had lost their previous three games, including a 3-0 shutout at the hands of Clarkson.
Meanwhile, Quinnipiac could present the toughest challenge Harvard will face this season, perhaps besides undefeated Boston College. The Bobcats have won five games in a row and have only lost once this season—a tight game against Yale on Halloween.
Almost 15 minutes into the final period of its sole loss, Quinnipiac held a 3-2 advantage over the Bulldogs. However, after back-to-back goals from Yale captain Janelle Ferrara, the Bulldogs took the lead and held on to win the game, 4-3.
Despite the loss to a Yale team with only two wins, Quinnipiac has been able to get back on track with five straight wins. Over the course of the streak, the Bobcats shut out then-No. 4/4 Clarkson, 3-0, and have outscored their opponents by a combined score of 16-2. They also have recorded four shutouts over the five-game span.
“I think they’re a really good team,” D’Oench said. “They’re going to be up there in the standings this year. This is...a very important game, so we want to make sure we get a win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Traditionally, a few select colleges have largely dominated the recruiting scene of men’s college swimming. These are large, often public schools: think powerhouses like Cal, Florida, USC, and Texas.
But it might be time to add Harvard to that list.
Slowly but surely, Harvard has become an annual recruiting powerhouse in men’s swimming, often attracting athletes away from its well-established counterparts on the West Coast. After becoming stronger year by year, Harvard recruited the 12th best recruiting class in the nation in 2014 and the seventh-best this past year, according to SwimSwam Magazine. Princeton is the only other school among the Ancient Eight which has had similar recruiting success, having landed the sixth-best recruiting class in 2014.
This marks a sharp transition for a program that traditionally used to lag behind the typical recruiting heavyweights but has now emerged as a real competitor on the recruiting front.
Last year, Harvard landed one of its biggest commits in recent memory in now-sophomore Ed Kim, a sprinter out of Washington who at one point was the top-ranked recruit in the nation. This year, Harvard once again landed an impressively deep recruiting class, headlined by sprinter Sebastian Lutz, backstroker Daniel Tran, and distance swimmer Logan Houck.
So what makes Harvard so appealing to these top-flight swimmers? Harvard’s athletic appeal might not rest just in its athletics program but in its academic prestige.
“A huge factor for me in my choice was my life after swimming,” Kim said. “I looked at which school would be the best for me in that aspect, and Harvard was at the top of the list—since, obviously, it’s Harvard. Academics was a really big factor in my decision.”
Because the Ivy League does not award athletic scholarships, an athlete’s academic record also plays a large role in the school’s decision to recruit an athlete—meaning all Crimson swimmers must also adhere to Harvard’s high athletic standards.
“Part of the reason [for my commit] was the balance that Harvard had between academics and athletics,” said Tran, who was named a National Merit Finalist and Presidential Scholar candidate in high school. “I found it to be the best balance, where you could focus on both things at once.”
For these student-athletes, the recruiting process often starts at the end of sophomore year in high school, when swimmers first introduce themselves to schools. On July 1 of the summer after a swimmer’s junior year, college coaches are free to start actively recruiting rising high school seniors.
During the summer, Harvard coaches attend the biggest meets of the year—such as nationals and junior nationals—to watch potential recruits swim. If interested, coaches will pay the swimmers house visits and invite them to formal recruiting trips on campus at the beginning of their senior year.
“The recruiting trips are a huge part of the recruiting process,” Tran said. “It’s on those trips when you get a closer look at the team, at the coaches, at how the training program is.”
It’s also on those trips that many of the swimmers decide on Harvard.
“For me, the moment I knew I wanted to come here was when I walked onto the campus and met everyone for the first time,” Kim said. “I got to know the guys really well; they were really nice to me, and I felt really welcome around here.”
Tran echoed the sentiment.
“The selling factor for me was the team…. There’s a secret tradition that the swim team does on [one of] the recruiting trips,” Tran said. “I can’t say what it is, but it really showed that the team was there for you and really unified, and that moment really pulled me in and led me [to verbally commit].”
Once verbally committed in this manner, at many other schools, swimmers would then sign a National Letter of Intent legally binding them to the school. But due to Harvard’s lack of athletic scholarships, the process for Crimson recruits occurs a little differently.
Like all other applicants, swimmers must apply via the normal applicant pool, whereupon they are typically issued what is known as a “likely” letter. These letters are essentially informal offers of admission, given the athletes’ academic and moral standards do not significantly drop.
The uniqueness of the Ivy recruiting process and the lack of athletic scholarships do not seem to be significant deterrents, however, for the recruits to Harvard swimming. This year, again, the Crimson have landed a deep recruiting class. IM and breaststroker Daniel Chang, the 45th-ranked recruit in the class of 2016, and backstroker Dean Farris, the 49th-ranked recruit headline the class of incoming freshmen.
“I chose Harvard because of the great relationship I have with [the coaches]...and the team,” Farris said in an interview with SwimSwam. “Also, I feel there will be the perfect balance of challenge in both the classroom and the pool.”
Behind the consistent strength of its recruiting efforts, Harvard has not lost a regular season dual meet since January 2014, and the Crimson finished second in the Ivy League championships last year to archrival Princeton after nabbing first the year before.
This season, the team has remained dominant, winning each of its first four matchups by a significant margin. Along with the Tigers, the Crimson are co-favorites to take home this year’s Ivy League crown. For Harvard, a championship would mark its 24th in school history.
Given the team’s past and projected success, it is not all that surprising that many of the recruits have no regrets about their decisions to come to Cambridge.
“I’m very happy with my choice,” Kim said. “If given [it] again, I would choose Harvard in a heartbeat.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON—While the Northeastern men’s basketball team raised a banner in celebration of its Colonial Athletic Association title and NCAA tournament appearance last season, the Harvard men’s basketball team was fighting to rediscover the strengths that got it to the Big Dance four consecutive times.
Wednesday night at Matthews Arena, the Crimson showed flashes of promise that it could return to its dominant ways of old against in-state opponents. But Harvard’s 80-71 loss to the Huskies (6-1) proved that there remains a significant amount of work to do in Cambridge.
SHOWING ITS YOUTH
While the Crimson (2-5) lost the bulk of its production from the 2014-2015 season, a campaign which saw Harvard go down to the wire against North Carolina in the NCAA tournament, Northeastern returned three starters from its playoff run last season in seniors David Walker, Quincy Ford, and Zach Stahl.
Nonetheless, the Crimson had a dominant first half performance on the offensive end, shooting 62 percent in the first half behind 11 points apiece from senior forward Patrick Steeves and freshman forward Weisner Perez. But when the Huskies got into a groove, the young Harvard team was unable to slow them down. With just over six minutes to go in the second half, Northeastern had built up a 17 point lead, having held the Crimson scoreless for over three minutes.
“I thought once they had a chance to push the lead against us, boy, they seized it,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “That’s the mark of, I think, a veteran team and a good team.”
The Crimson’s inexperience was especially prevalent in the backcourt with the ball-handling of Harvard’s guards. Though freshman point guard Tommy McCarthy had a season-high nine assists, the Crimson turned the ball over 15 times, allowing Northeastern to convert the mistakes into 20 points.
“We got sloppy with [turnovers] at times, but they forced some,” Amaker said. “That’s a function of their ability to anticipate and dart in and out and make it difficult as we’re trying to make plays and handle the ball, which is not a strong suit of our team this year. And I think they knew that.” 
Though the Huskies were able to utilize their veteran advantage, the Harvard freshmen provided a few bright spots. Along with McCarthy, Perez provided an offensive spark in the first half when many of the Crimson starters got into foul trouble. Perez scored his 13 points in just 12 minutes on the floor.
DISAPPOINTING DEFENSE
In his postgame press conference, the word that Tommy Amaker used over and over to describe his team’s performance was “disappointing.” Northeastern’s 80 points on the night were the most Harvard has allowed this season, four more than the Kris Dunn-led Providence Friars, now ranked No. 23 in the country. The Huskies also became the first of the Crimson’s opponents this season to shoot better than 40 percent from the floor.
Early foul trouble by the Harvard starters plagued the defense as Northeastern was able to attack the basket and get to the line in response. While Harvard only managed to shoot 3-for-8 from the charity stripe, the Huskies were much more frequent visitors to the line, where they shot 14-of-17.
“I wish we could have defended a little better, but they are a very difficult team to defend,” Amaker said. “They spread you, they have guys that can put the ball down and make a play…. I just think they are a difficult team to defend, and we were certainly hopeful that we could do a better job as we were scoring because we were having a good opportunity to put the ball in the basket on our end.”
Along with drawing fouls, the Huskies had their way with the Crimson on the glass, snagging 14 offensive rebounds. Junior forward Zena Edosomwan had just seven rebounds on the night, below his season average of 10 per game.
“We need more on the backboard [from Edosomwan],” Amaker said. “He knows that, and we’re hopeful that he can give us more, but he isn’t the only one that we need more from on the backboard against a team like Northeastern.”
Despite the fact that Amaker called his team’s showing on Wednesday one of his team’s weakest defensive performances of the season, Northeastern coach Bill Coen lauded the Crimson as one of the toughest defenses his team has seen this year.
“I think Harvard is one of the best defensive teams that we’ve faced,” Coen said. “I thought they won the majority of the 50-50 balls and really played with tremendous energy.”

Now that Thanksgiving is officially behind us, it's finally socially acceptable to throw yourself completely into the spirit of the winter holidays. As we all know, the life of a college student is often a frugal one, and unfortunately, that doesn’t change as the holidays come around. Luckily, Flyby is here with an affordable guide to celebrating the holidays in your dorm room:
Kwanzaa
One way to get into the holiday spirit is to set up a Kwanzaa alter in your room. However, some decorations can be very expensive and far out of your budget’s reach. Instead of going out and buying decorations, steal some fruits and vegetables from your dining hall and maybe steal a nearby curtain with a nice pattern. Now you have the beginnings of an affordable alter right at home in your dorm. Just think of the accompanying fruit flies as extra guests.
Hanukkah
What’s a Hanukkah celebration without some good, old-fashioned gelt? Too bad you probably can’t afford it. That’s why a much more economical approach would be to make your own. A large box of gelt online can be upwards of $10, whereas a roll of aluminum foil at CVS is only $5. Buy some foil and get to wrapping! Get your hands on some free dining hall cookies and make your own ridiculously large gelt for the holiday season.

Claim your HarvardKey, they said.
We all recently received an email instructing us to set up HarvardKey, the long awaited new and “improved” login system that is attempting to unify everything Harvard so that we can all access anything from Canvas to Harvard Secure Wifi with a single password. While this may seem like a decent idea in principle, let me assure you that the decision to “claim my HarvardKey” was not a smart one, and would advise anyone who has not yet made the change to stick to their good old HUID/Pin combo.
The instructions give some hint that there are a few steps necessary to getting your life back in order after setting up HarvardKey, but in no way prepare you for the absolute disaster to come. After setting up my new HarvardKey login, I was without warning logged out of Harvard Secure Wifi on both my phone and laptop, Canvas, two separate email accounts (on every device that uses them), my.harvard.edu, the printer login, and everything else that I could ever possibly need in my daily life. Not only can I still not log into one of my emails, but I wasted hours on end trying (and repeatedly failing) to set up the Wifi on my phone and computer. I then had to go through and change all of the passwords that I had saved on all of my devices to my new “HarvardKey”, with minimal instruction as to what interfaces this password could even be used for.
Not to mention the fact that Harvard seems to have neglected a little thing called password autofill. Seriously, when’s the last time anyone actually went through the process of typing a password into anything? So in trying to solve this little problem that actually wasn’t so cumbersome to begin with, HarvardKey left me with slower internet access (goodbye, Harvard Secure), inability to access my email, and a momentary loss of my sanity.
