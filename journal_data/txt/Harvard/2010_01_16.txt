After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the second installment of a season based around ideas of change and transformation, the Actors’ Shakespeare Project (ASP) undertakes one of the Bard’s great comedies to tragically underwhelming effect. Despite brief moments of inspired hilarity, ASP’s production of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” which runs through January 24, falls short with a performance that lacks clarity and vigor.
In his program note, director Benjamin Evett references “the secret play” that lies within a traditional reading of “Midsummer”: “[It] exists somewhere within the confluence of all these people and these ingenious words.” The idea of confluence, unfortunately, does not apply to the confused design of this production. Evett has attempted to urbanize the play, but his concept does not translate to the stage effectively.
In this “Midsummer,” the Athenian characters tangled in various romantic webs are clothed as middle-class suburbanites; conversely, their mischievous fairy counterparts are dressed in alternative, urban outfits. Unfortunately, this aesthetic is poorly defined and inconsistent. Oberon, Titania, and Puck are dressed as goths, while their fairies are hip hop dancers. To boot, the scenery centers around a yellow, graffitied car that could have been plucked directly from the 1960s. This array of clashing aesthetics diminishes the show’s overall effect by confounding the audience’s sense of place and time.
Spatially, the production feels muddled as well. “Midsummer” unfolds in Midway Studios, a multi-level space replete with brick walls and fascinating architecture. It’s a venue that abounds with creative possibilities, which makes the use of space in this production feel underwhelming and conventional. John Malinowski’s lighting fails to help delineate spaces or clarify locations, the exception being an electrifying sequence in which Puck (Maurice Emmanuel Parent) enters the nighttime forest under eerie, deep-blue backlight.
Even when one looks past the baffling design elements of ASP’s “Midsummer,” there is little to redeem the production. Evett’s staging is functional, but it consistently lacks energy. Furthermore, several actors are egregiously miscast, such as Dayenne Byron Walters, who feels stiflingly rigid playing the elderly Egeus in an inexplicable and unfounded instance of cross-gender casting.
To that end, most of the performances are lackluster. Actors’ Shakespeare Project is a company dedicated to bringing the Bard’s words to life through vivid acting, but here, they fall into lame, affected performances. Their acting is more indicative than realistic as they plod through line readings and Evett’s unenergetic blocking. The resulting scenes feel dull in their predictability.
There are a few exceptions, most notably the spectacular Robert Walsh in his portrayal of Nick Bottom. Walsh is a breath of fresh air, and his presence on stage adds a kind of vitality to the show that other scenes fundamentally lack. His Bottom is a likable blue-collar guy, charmingly obnoxious and sometimes brash, but all the more endearing for his flaws.
Yet, when Bottom is transformed into a donkey, Walsh is forced to don a garish and unnecessary donkey helmet. Stuffed with found objects and capped with a mane of rainbow-colored ribbons, this hideous prop serves little function except to obscure Walsh’s facial expressions. Why try to hide the best thing the show has going for it?
Walsh does, however, find himself at the center of a truly remarkable rendition of the play’s Pyramus and Thisbe scene. Shakespeare’s purposely atrocious play-within-the-play reaches almost sublime levels of comic absurdity, and is the only scene that truly succeeds. John Kuntz—who plays a caricatured version of Peter Quince to perfection—begins the scene by acting out the play with action figures. His madcap energy fully sustains this feat until the other actors take over with even more delightfully embarrassing antics. Walsh’s Pyramus performs an intensely physical death sequence in which he literally throws himself about the stage, indefatigably acting out his demise through increasingly gruesome stunts to great effect.
Overall, this production’s strengths cannot redeem its deep-seated faults. The poorly-executed design, lethargic staging, and predictable performances make for a night of theater that is passable at best, but largely uninspiring. “Somewhere, hidden beneath the concrete layers of our presumptions,” Evett writes, “lies a new play, surprising, sweet, funny, urgent, vital. We don’t know what it looks like or sounds like, but we will know it when we see it.” It’s a beautiful sentiment, but ASP unfortunately could not find that play beneath the disarray.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With just over a month remaining in the regular season, the Harvard women’s hockey team knows that there is no time to waste. But Friday night, a last-second goal prevented the Crimson from picking up a crucial two points in the ECAC standings.
Cornell junior Karlee Overguard found the back of the net with 4.4 seconds left on the clock, forcing No. 6 Harvard (8-4-4, 6-4-2 ECAC) to settle for a 4-4 draw with the No. 10 Big Red (8-7-3, 7-1-3) at Bright Hockey Center.
“It’s not ever fun to come out with the tie,” senior Anna McDonald said. “We’re at that point in the season where we need to start getting the wins [and] not take away from all the hard work that we’re doing.”
Though the final seconds belonged to Cornell, the game’s opening seconds were all Crimson.
On the first shift of the game, junior winger Liza Ryabkina slid a pass to McDonald from the left corner, and Big Red goalie Amanda Mazzotta never saw the senior’s shot coming through traffic. 21 seconds into the game, Harvard was up, 1-0.
“[The line of Ryabkina, McDonald and senior Randi Griffin is] going to net, they’re real aggressive, they got off to a great start the first shift of the game,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “I think that gave them some confidence.”
Just over three minutes later, Harvard doubled its lead. Junior Leanna Coskren put the puck on co-captain Cori Bassett’s stick, and the defenseman’s slapshot from the blue line soared past Mazzotta into the net. Rookie Jillian Dempsey was credited with an assist.
“I think it was important, especially against these guys who always come back, that we set the pace right away,” McDonald said. “That helped us.”
But it didn’t take long for Cornell to bring the deficit back to one. Freshman phenom Lauriane Rougeau beat Crimson senior netminder Christina Kessler on the Big Red’s first shot of the game, making the score 2-1 with just five minutes gone in the contest.
Although Harvard would continue to dominate play in the first, outshooting Cornell, 12-8, it couldn’t capitalize on its three power-play chances against the nation’s top penalty-kill unit.
Instead, it was the Big Red that made the most of its special-teams chance early in the second period. With junior Ashley Wheeler in the box for an interference infraction, Cornell sophomore Catherine White put the puck on net. Kessler tried to cover it up, but it bounced right onto the stick of Chelsea Karpenko, who slammed it home.
But good things came in pairs for Harvard, and in the second half of the period, another set of quick goals brought the score to 4-2.
At 13:22 of the second, co-captain Kathryn Farni let a shot rip from the point that bounced hard off the glass behind the net. McDonald picked up the puck and pounded in her second goal of the night.
Less than two minutes later, Ryabkina extended the Crimson’s advantage. Junior Kate Buesser sent a cross-ice pass to her classmate, who roofed the one-timer for the 4-2 lead.
“I felt we played very well tonight and had...a lot of great chemistry between our lines,” Stone said. “Unfortunately, we let them sneak back into the game.”
And sneak back the Big Red did. Another Wheeler penalty gave Cornell an opportunity on the power play, and the Big Red peppered Kessler with shots. From the scrum in front of the net, Laura Fortino was able to pop the puck over the goal line.
Harvard got a chance on the power play late in the third, but again Cornell’s kill unit held it quiet.
With 1:41 to play, the Big Red called a timeout and subsequently pulled Mazzotta from the net. Though Harvard’s defense held strong through the closing seconds, even forcing Cornell back into its own zone, the extra-man advantage was too much in the end.
From another scrum, Overguard lit the lamp with 4.4 seconds with a shot from the slot—completing another third-period comeback for the Big Red.
“It’s disappointing to be up two goals with [12 minutes to play] and have them tie up the game,” Stone said. “And I struggle with the scrums in front of the net and the lack of protection of the goaltender.”
The Crimson got plenty of opportunities in the extra session, getting off four shots and gaining two power plays, but couldn’t find a way to bring home its first victory of 2010.
“It’s extremely disappointing,” Stone said. “There are so many positive things that happened, but we’ve got to close the deal. One way or another, we’ve got to close the deal.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Everyone knows that defense wins championships, but the Harvard women’s hockey team saw tonight how special teams can win games.
Despite holding a one-skater advantage for more than four minutes throughout the final 10 of last night’s match against Cornell, the Crimson was unable to convert the goal that would have secured a victory.
Harvard’s failure to light the lamp in each of its final three powerplay opportunities underscored the team’s struggles on special teams throughout the evening.
While the Big Red kept the Crimson off the scoreboard through nearly ten minutes with a player down, Harvard surrendered two powerplay goals to the visitors.
“I thought overall our kill was good,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “It’s just when you get so many chances whacking away with the goaltender on her tail something bad is going to happen.”
Although the stingy Cornell penalty kill, which has surrendered just one goal this season, kept Harvard from finishing, the Crimson was not without opportunities.
After the Big Red’s Laura Danforth was whistled for roughing with just over four minutes remaining in the third period, Harvard had two good looks at the net.
First senior Cori Bassett’s slap shot from center ice was blocked by a Cornell defender, and then senior Anna McDonald’s shot sailed wide.
“Those things happen,” Stone said. “As long as you’re generating chances and shots, eventually things will fall for you.”
Despite tonight’s unproductive results, Stone remains optimistic about her new special teams units, which were changed after the team’s previous matchup.
McDonald also feels that the new lines will help Harvard offensively.
“We were kind of getting stale with other ones so I think these are going to work out,” McDonald said.
IN THE NICK OF TIME
Cornell’s final tally with just 4 ticks left on the clock marks the second time this season that the Big Red has managed to score against its Ivy League rival in the game’s waning minutes.
When the Crimson travelled to Ithaca on Oct. 31 for its third match of the season, Cornell’s Melanie Jue came away with a goal with just 3:03 remaining to earn the 4-3 victory.
This time Cornell escaped defeat by evening the score at four with just seconds remaining.
“We said in the locker room between the second and the third that we had to come out hard because we knew they never stop,” McDonald said.
But that did not stop Cornell from netting two third period goals to come back from a 4-2 deficit entering the final frame.
“We got to close the deal,” Stone said. “One way or another, we’ve got to close the deal.”
Before this season’s loss and tie, Harvard had won six-straight contests against the Big Red, with Cornell’s last victory coming in the 2005-06 season, when the Crimson fell 4-3, just days after losing the Beanpot Championship.
