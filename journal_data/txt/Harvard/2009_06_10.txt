This is just too sad. A deer died yesterday after trying to jump over the wrought-iron fence around the cemetery between the Square and the Quad, according to the Cambridge Chronicle, which offers up the following quote from  Cambridge Deputy Fire Chief Jack Gelinas.
Horrifying. And it just goes to show. If the deer had had a shuttle, this never would have happened.
