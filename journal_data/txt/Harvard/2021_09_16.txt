After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard welcomes its largest-ever cohort of freshmen onto campus, more students than ever will come to realize an ironic truth. Although a passion for learning may have brought them here, perhaps an even more critical aspect of their experience will be unlearning what they have been taught their whole lives and will continue to be taught in many of Harvard’s classes. This begins with the education system itself.
New students need to confront and reject the logics and values of the multiple systems of oppression that have and will continue to warp their educational experiences. However, this is no simple task: Many of these harmful ideas disguise themselves in seemingly benign and ubiquitous social values and practices, at which most people would never blink twice.
Perhaps the most critical set of ideas to unlearn will be their understanding of the process of learning in the first place. Although most of us are aware that the American education system is deeply inequitable, other than through snarky jokes and eye-rolls behind teacher’s backs, many students have not questioned the practice of grading itself; specifically, the process of using a standardized grading scale to motivate, measure, and communicate student’s learning. This toxic approach to education is largely responsible for the high levels of chronic stress, anxiety, and sleep deprivation amongst young people, especially at elite institutions like Harvard where widespread imposter syndrome is added to the mix.
Grading helps create these problems, as well as a host of others, because it hinders rather than motivates learning. The fundamental logic of grading — that offering rewards makes people more likely to repeat behavior, or to behave better — has been disproven in multiple studies. In fact, psychological studies on the impacts of rewards and grading consistently find that rewards cause people to perform worse, lose internal drive, and suffer psychologically. Offering the reward actually implicitly devalues the behavior by suggesting it is something that you must be compensated to do. Arbitrary numbers and letters fail to accurately communicate how well a student has learned, yet most students place value on these metrics rather than comments and feedback from their instructors. Grading further hinders learning by encouraging students to cheat or mislead their teachers, making it harder for teachers to actually gauge their students’ needs.
Even more problematic, however, are the deeply hierarchical values underlying the system of grading. Our education system emulates capitalist social values by treating grades as a pseudo-currency and suggesting that the people with the most currency — the highest GPAs — have more merit and value than others. Some students are “gifted and talented” and thus worthy of elite higher education, while others are deemed failures destined for a prison cell, especially Black and poor children.
Students are taught that performance determines a person’s ability, which in turn determines their worth, poisoning their mental health. Comparative levels of intellect, ability, and talent as measured by grades and standardized tests become a core and fixed part of one’s identity at an early age. This notion of a fixed general intelligence that determines worth is an ableist and historically racist product of the eugenics movement, from which standardized tests and general intelligence tests were born and that modern grading (which also emerged around the same time in the early 1900s) perpetuates.
Under a grading regime, the point of learning becomes to compete and gain more grade points than others instead of developing the skills to contribute to your community or explore your interests. Success comes from superiority through competition with others while collaboration is disincentivized. Students are taught to sacrifice their basic health needs and mental stability instead of prioritizing proper sleep, nutrition, and shelter, all of which are essential to learning. Accommodations for neurodivergent and disabled students are often inadequate or haphazardly implemented rather than tailored to each student’s individual needs. Under standardized education systems, children are viewed as deviant beings who must be coerced into learning instead of naturally curious, creative, and eager students.
Thus, as we head into our first school year since the pandemic as a whole community, we must revolutionize our values by unlearning and relearning what it means to be students. We must realize that we should feel no shame in struggling or asking for help because learning at your own pace does not make you any less intelligent or worthy. We should feel successful not from competing with their peers but from building community with them through collaboration, inclusion, and compassion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the frenzy surrounding the recent rise in coronavirus cases on Harvard’s campus, some have called on the University to commit to not sending its undergraduates home, or at least to not do so without revealing in advance what would prompt that move. At first glance, this request seems both sensible and justified: Eviction would be painful, and it seems reasonable to try to limit its likelihood and blunt its impact if it becomes unavoidable.
However, this policy change would be much more dangerous than its advocates imagine, and Harvard should not commit to anything of the sort.
To start, it is worth acknowledging an obvious fact: The discomfort of being sent home from college is not remotely close in moral importance to the loss of a life. If we could be sure that the discomfort of 7000-odd students’ eviction would prevent even one death, only an utterly immoral administrator would stand by and condemn that student, faculty member, employee, or family member to death.
Of course, knowledge like that is impossible in a situation like this one. During a pandemic, we will never be able to operate with anything more than likelihoods. However, it doesn’t seem like a stretch to assume that this moral truth would hold even if a potential death were not absolutely guaranteed; if we could be, say, 90 percent certain that a member of our community would die if we were to remain on campus, most would likely agree that eviction is the right course of action.
Unfortunately, such a near-guarantee of death, or at least of extreme suffering, is quite possible in our situation. Even with extensive vaccination, breakthrough infections are possible, and severe cases, though rare, can also occur. Moreover, the Harvard bubble is porous. Many members of the faculty and staff — who have far less agency in choosing to be on campus than students do — go home at the end of each day to young children without a shot at vaccination in the near future. Harvard undergraduates frequent countless neighborhood businesses without vaccine mandates for their workers. Thus, unvaccinated people are likely to be hit by the shockwave of an outbreak on campus. With enough infections, at least one severe infection would be likely, and in such a case, evicting students from campus would be morally obligatory.
However, the one constant throughout this pandemic has been its unpredictability. Virtually none of its sudden turns, from its original spread across the globe to the surge we see today, was predicted months, or even weeks, in advance. This is the case because, despite the vast predictive repertoire of the world’s scientists, we are still far from being able to forecast the viral developments and behavioral trends that determine the course of Covid-19.
As a result, we can confidently say much less in advance than we think we can about what conditions on campus would be too risky to tolerate. Even though we believe we know what those conditions are, that knowledge hinges on an understanding of the virus and others’ pandemic behavior which we simply don’t have. Even if we did, an unpredictable future can easily overturn any handle on the pandemic’s trajectory.
And if Harvard publicly releases a set of criteria that would prompt our eviction, it risks being unable to handle that future. If new facts about the pandemic make it clear that a seemingly innocuous situation is actually unbearably dangerous, then the public existence of such a guideline would likely lead to life-threatening vacillation among administrators, who cannot help but be guided by public perception, irate students, and the inertia of their own previous positions.
The risk, then, of releasing such criteria is immense: When faced with exponential spread, any delay is almost incomprehensibly severe. And the thing being risked — the death or incapacitation of someone who may have had no choice in being here — is clearly grave. In comparison, the potential harm of not releasing such criteria — the whiplash of being suddenly sent home — seems utterly unimportant.
When its benefits and drawbacks are compared, it becomes clear that Harvard should not put out a set of conditions that would lead it to send us home. If worse comes to worst and students are sent home again, knowing this in advance would certainly reduce the pain students would feel. But drawing an ill-conceived line in the sand would ultimately risk actual lives in what would be a truly misguided bargain.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This year’s return to campus, for most of us, couldn’t have been more highly anticipated. But amidst a flurry of move-in excitement, a curious number of us were equally eager to arrive off-campus. This year, 265 students decided against living in Harvard housing — double the amount that resides off-campus during a typical year, but ultimately only raising the total student population living off-campus to a still slight 4 percent.
This small increase should not catch us by surprise. We have had to discard and reimage nearly every staple of campus life this past year and a half. Each student deserves the chance to decide how to rebuild their individual life here at Harvard as we all figure out how to do the same as a community.
Ultimately, we just want students to feel comfortable in their living space. For some, that peace might be found in an off-campus apartment, a mode of living this pandemic year might have revealed they’re suited to. Good for them. Even still, we hope, for most of us, that happy living arrangements can be found in one of Harvard’s 12 trademark upperclassmen Houses.
Four percent of undergraduates living off-campus shouldn’t be taken as a cue to start eulogizing House life. But Harvard’s uniquely residential setup is a wonderful quirk of our college. That well-over 90 percent of undergraduates have chosen, for decades, to reside on campus all four years is special, and, in many ways, is the fabric of our shared college experience.
This past year and a half has been unwieldy, confusing, and weird. Much of “normal” has fallen to the wayside. But we sincerely hope that this slight uptick in those opting out of House life doesn’t mark the beginning of a trend as we ease into the era of post-pandemic House life.
Of course, House life this year cannot be as straightforward as it was before. The Classes of 2023 and 2024 are just starting to familiarize themselves with this ecosystem and the Class of 2022 has leapfrogged from their Houses youngest to oldest, all the old familiar faces having graduated. Residents of all years are still finding their way.
Covid aside, students have historically maintained various connections to their Houses. Some are on a first-name basis with their deans. Many run in and out of House events only to grab two (maybe 10) free cookies. But when that programming cannot happen due to social distancing guidelines – or when planners are confused on how to hold fun events within Harvard’s guidelines – fewer students will likely end up building strong relationships with their three-year homes. And that’s a shame.
House life, at its best, is another shot at making Harvard feel like home. It can connect disparate students who might not have become friends if not for dining hall meet-cutes. That sophomores and juniors have a diminished shot at reaping these benefits because of our strained times is depressing.
Very real constraints have been imposed on House life: from Harvard’s 10-person limit on dorm room gatherings, to new restrictions on our capacity to loiter, even masked, in indoor spaces with our new House-mates. It’s difficult, if not impossible, to instantly recapitulate what House life was in years past. But these restrictions don’t mean House life can’t be made appealing.
To jumpstart House spirit, tutors and deans should do more than in years past to foster community within entryways, dorms, and the House as a whole. Outdoor steins and study breaks seem like a good start. They should reach out to those who seem disconnected, and exert particular energy to learn the names of students they don’t already know.
Seniors have a role to play here, too. There is no one better — in fact, no one else — to pass on House traditions and teach us just how great House life can be. We should take care to preserve those customs for the future, even as the world around us continues to put them on hold.
Even if some friends choose to live off-campus, quintessential House life — those charming moments of bonding over Harvard’s grueling lack of AC, or pondering who exactly Red is, and whether this really is his best catch — will always hold a special place in our hearts, and likely continue to define the Harvard experience. As we work to rebuild this community, we wish its deserters well.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Experts from the Harvard Graduate School of Education and Harvard School of Public Health said in a Wednesday event that Covid-safe school infrastructure and individual student support systems are critical to successful school reopenings during the pandemic.
Moderated by HGSE Dean Bridget Terry Long and HSPH Dean Michelle A. Williams, the panel — part of the HGSE’s recurring webinar series “Education Now” — included Meira Levinson, an Education professor at HGSE; Josephine M. Kim, a senior lecturer on Education; Joseph G. Allen, an associate professor of Exposure Assessment Science at HSPH; and Natalia Linos, the executive director of Harvard’s François-Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights.
Williams opened the event by explaining the close ties between education and public health.
“Education, like public health, [is] the taproot, the seed corn, or, if you will, the bedrock of all that drives and sustains civil society,” Williams said.
Following Williams, Long spoke to the need for healthy school environments.
“Healthy kids translates into the opportunity for high quality learning, and the opposite is most certainly true,” Long said. “There are numerous studies that document that poor health is related to lower academic achievement. Simply put, it’s hard to concentrate and to learn if your health is suffering.”
Allen explained that deleterious conditions can occur in schools when they only meet the “minimum standards” of proper air ventilation and filtration systems.
“Forty years ago, we started to set our building standards for bare minimums — not for health, not for student well being, not for teacher success and performance,” Allen said. “The standard by name is called the ‘Standard for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality,’ so when did ‘acceptable’ become acceptable? It’s objectively not.”
Later in the panel, Kim, Levinson, and Linos pivoted toward the importance of supporting people in all roles at schools — students, teachers, bus drivers, cafeteria staff, and so forth — amid reopenings.
When asked which group she thought would have the greatest challenge reacclimating to in-person instruction, Levinson said everyone in a school is interconnected.
“We can’t think about children and students’ well-being separate from the well-being of teachers, school administrators, custodians, bus drivers, cafeteria workers, et cetera,” Levinson said.
“When you ask me who I am most concerned about, I am most concerned about seeing people, schools, and groups as members of interest groups who are in opposition to one another and are getting caught up in that, and I’m most hoping that we can start to take a more holistic approach,” she added.
Linos added that, though anxiety is high due to the Delta variant, it is important to acknowledge the progress made and continue to trust the emerging science on the matter.
“In this moment of anxiety around Delta, I think it’s important to acknowledge that we are in a better place,” Linos said. “We know that universal masking works; we know that the way to keep kids safe who can’t be vaccinated is to vaccinate everybody around them who can be.”

Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard plans to maintain pressure on the University to shed its remaining fossil fuels investments and advocate for Harvard to invest instead in green economic initiatives in the wake of the University’s surprise announcement last week that it would eventually divest from the fossil fuel sector.
FFDH organizers announced their new goals alongside elected officials and environmental activists at a virtual press conference Wednesday, which followed University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s Sept. 9 declaration that the University’s endowment “does not intend” to make future investments in the fossil fuel industry.
Currently, fossil fuels make up less than 2 percent of Harvard’s endowment portfolio, but it will likely be years before those holdings are sold off, since Harvard Management Company — which controls the University’s endowment — has a legal obligation to fund its remaining commitments to private equity firms that invest in fossil fuels.
“HMC is legally obligated to fund capital calls if requested by the general partner up to the maximum capital committed at the time of the investment,” Bacow’s Sept. 9 announcement reads.
Divest Harvard organizers signaled Wednesday that they will continue their pressure campaign until HMC follows through with its pledge to allow its investments in fossil fuels to end.
“We’re going to be focusing on holding Harvard accountable, of course, for phasing out its remaining indirect investments in fossil fuels,” said Ilana A. Cohen ’23, an FFDH organizer. “But we’re also going to be really working to further this larger vision of sustainable re-investment.”
She said FFDH hopes to pivot its efforts to urge the University to scale up its investments in a more “just, regenerative economy” that “needs to take the place of the fossil fuel industry and other extractive and exploitative industries like it.”
The press conference, which included divest activists from Princeton and leaders of international environmental organizations, also discussed the significance of Harvard’s announcement for other divestment campaigns across universities, as well as the financial impact on the fossil fuel industry.
Environmental activist William E. “Bill” McKibben ’82, a former Crimson president, kicked off the press conference acknowledging the years-long work of organizers behind the divestment movement, but lamented that Harvard’s announcement came “too late.”
“This day comes too late to save the people who died in Hurricane Ida, or to save the forests of the West that have gone up in the last six months, or, frankly, to save the people who will perish in the years ahead, but not too late to be a huge help in doing what we still can,” McKibben said. “By turning up the heat on Harvard and everywhere else, the people on this call have done a magnificent job of helping turn down the heat on the earth, and that is what we desperately need.”
McKibben said that Harvard’s decision left its peer institutions that still invest in fossil fuels with “no place to hide.”
“It’s entirely clear at this point that the smart money has fled the fossil fuel industry, and that we need everyone out,” he said.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on the press conference.
On Wednesday, Cohen also touched on FFDH’s pending legal complaint filed earlier this year with the office of Massachusetts attorney general Maura T. Healey ’92, noting that the group is still awaiting a response from her office.
“The legal complaint is now really in the hands of our Massachusetts state attorney general,” Cohen said.
Cohen added that she hoped the complaint would serve as a template to “uplift” other divest movements like one at Boston College.
“We’ve put forward what we believe is an incredibly compelling argument,” Cohen said. “This is an argument that we also believe is more broadly applicable to other institutions that have nonprofit status, so we’re waiting to see what the AG does with this complaint.”

Boston City Councilors Michelle Wu ’07 and Annissa Essaibi George emerged victorious in Boston’s preliminary mayoral election Tuesday, and will advance to the general election in November.
With all precincts reporting, the city’s unofficial tally showed Wu in first with 33.4 percent of the vote and Essaibi George in second with 22.5 percent, as of Wednesday morning. Andrea J. Campbell, also an early frontrunner, failed to advance with 19.7 percent of the vote, as did Acting Mayor Kim M. Janey, with 19.5 percent.
This fall’s contest will determine who will take over Janey’s position as Boston’s mayor, who herself succeeded former Mayor Martin J. “Marty” Walsh following his confirmation as Labor Secretary.
Wu, who polls have consistently shown to be the frontrunner, received strong backing from some in the Democratic Party’s progressive wing — including U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Wu’s former professor at Harvard Law School. Wu also campaigned on the promise of a Green New Deal, winning her the endorsement of the Boston Sunrise Movement.
Essaibi George, by contrast, campaigned on more moderate positions, such as rebuilding Boston’s economy in the wake of Covid-19 and reforming the Boston Public Schools system. Essaibi George, a former BPS teacher, pledged to “rebuild trust with school communities,” according to the campaign’s website.
The election results were initially delayed, with only a few hundred votes made public on Tuesday night. According to Massachusetts Secretary of State William F. Galvin, this was because of a flood of mail-in and drop box ballots, with 7,000 collected on election night — about 4,000 more than expected.
In a press release following her victory, Wu thanked her opponents for “their long records of incredible work” in the city, and said she looked forward to “continuing our fight for the future of our city.”
“Together, we have and will continue to take on the big challenges we were told would be impossible—from passing paid parental leave to standing up to big corporations to protect rental housing,” Wu said. “Now is the time for all of us to lead.”
In her victory speech, Essaibi George acknowledged the “historical field of candidates” while thanking Janey — Boston’s first female mayor and first mayor of color — who she said “shattered a glass ceiling that was left intact for far too long.”
“Young women and girls everywhere — Black women and girls — have seen a reflection of themselves standing at the mayor’s podium,” Essaibi George said. “Kim, you did that for countless girls.”
Essaibi George also congratulated Wu on her victory, and added that she looked forward to campaigning and working with Wu “for a better Boston.”
Nayleth E. Lopez-Lopez ’23, a Harvard student who voted in the preliminary election, said she was happy to see Wu advance.
“I like her vision,” Lopez-Lopez said of Wu. “I feel like she’s shown a lot of promise on City Council, and I think she’d be a great next mayor.”
Wu and Essaibi George will face off in the general election on Nov. 2 to determine who will become Boston’s 56th mayor.
Regardless of which candidate wins the November general election, the new mayor will be Boston’s first elected woman and person of color to serve as mayor — a prospect Lopez-Lopez said she was “so excited” about.
“It’s so incredible to me, ever since it first started, how the field was dominated by women,” Lopez said of the mayoral election. “It’s very empowering to be able to have our next mayor be a woman.”

Bereft of in-person instruction for 18 months, many students eagerly returned to their seminars in Sever, lectures in Lowell, and sections in the Science Center last week — aided in part by Harvard’s vaccination requirement. Yet, for students with symptoms or diagnoses of Covid-19, online learning is not just a remnant of the past.
Though the Faculty of Arts and Sciences has outlined Covid-19 protocols for classroom instruction, course teaching staff have implemented their own approaches to accommodating students in Covid-related quarantine or isolation.
“Have a TF or fellow student they have identified use a smartphone to make a simple recording that can be uploaded to Canvas, along with any slides or presentations from class,” reads a suggested approach from FAS Covid-19 guidance.
The resources site also suggests that instructors “use Zoom as low-tech way to record class” or “bring a laptop to class and utilize Zoom to include your student in the lecture.”
“We’ve already had several cases, so this is not a hypothetical situation. It’s real,” said Steven R. Levitsky, a Government professor who teaches Government 20: “Foundations of Comparative Politics.”
Alison Frank Johnson, a History professor, wrote that she accommodated four students digitally early in the semester by using Zoom on her cell phone. If they had a question, a friend in the lecture would raise their hand and tell her to check her phone screen.
“It wasn’t perfect and certainly wouldn’t be good enough for a full term of so-called hybrid teaching, but it was better than nothing,” she wrote.
David I. Laibson ’88, an Economics professor, wrote that Economics 10: “Principles of Economics” both records and live-streams its lectures to its 761 students.
“All students are welcome to watch course-wide lectures on Canvas, either live streamed (use the dedicated [Slack] channel #lecture_questions to type questions, which we will ask on your behalf during class), or asynchronously,” the course’s policies reads.
Meanwhile, Courtney B. Lamberth, a Religion lecturer who teaches a seminar of 11 students, wrote in an email that she offers supplemental meetings for those who cannot attend courses in person.
“Because lecture and discussion unfold dialectically in my class, recording the class could undermine the comfort level of some students to participate fully, so I do not plan to tape class by video or audio,” Lamberth wrote.
Some courses have also adapted to be more Covid-conscious, even for students attending classes in person. Don Tontiplaphol, a Social Studies preceptor and instructor of Social Studies 10a: “Introduction to Social Studies,” said that the course uses a rough seating arrangement to facilitate contact tracing.
“We don’t have any sort of fixed pattern — we’re just asking students to remember where they sat last week,” Tontiplaphol said. “Week four, we can reassess whether we need to maintain the policy.”
Some faculty also expressed concern over the health and safety of students, especially in adjusting back to in-person courses.
“I mostly feel concerned about the physical and emotional wellbeing of my students, that they’re missing classes and the effect that has on them,” said Reshma Menon, a Mathematics preceptor and instructor of Math Ma: “Introduction to Functions and Calculus I.”
Charles A. “Chuck” Czeisler ’74, a sleep medicine professor at Harvard Medical School and who co-teaches General Education 1038: “Sleep,” said the recently-increased testing cadence for undergraduates has made him feel safer.
“Returning to in-person teaching is something that we all do with some trepidation, but I think that I have been reassured by the fact that the University Health Services — under the leadership of Dr. [Giang] Nguyen — has really responded,” he said.
Despite the turbulence surrounding Covid-19, Chemistry professor Eric N. Jacobsen shared his joy to be back in the classroom.
“There is certainly some trepidation about lecturing in a room full with 200 people given the virulence of the Delta variant and after a year in nearly complete isolation from students,” he said.
“But students and teaching staff alike seem genuinely excited to be back in the classroom, and I share that excitement,” he added.

UPDATED: September 17, 2021 at 2:15 p.m.
Harvard affiliates will become eligible for free seasonal flu shots at Cambridge Public Health Department clinics available to all city residents in a month.
The Health Department plans to host a total of four clinics between Oct. 15 and Oct. 23 that will offer two variations of the flu vaccine — a shot and a mist — at no cost to adults and children over 6 months old.
The clinic closest to the College is Citywide Senior Center in Central Square — one stop away from Harvard Square on the MBTA Red Line. Registration opens about two weeks before the clinic becomes operational.
Clinic walk-ins are accepted, but residents are encouraged to register online before going to a clinic to help the public health department follow Covid-19 safety procedures.
Harvard University Health Services has yet to announce a schedule for on-campus flu vaccine clinics. Still, University spokesperson Jason A. Newton urged affiliates to remain vigilant against influenza and Covid-19 in anticipation of the upcoming flu season. The season generally lasts from October to May, Newton wrote in an emailed statement.
“Both the flu and Covid-19 are respiratory illnesses and they can lead to significant complications, so we strongly encourage everyone in our community, from faculty, students, and staff, to get the flu vaccine,” Newton wrote.
He added that while all enrolled students are required to get vaccinated against the flu before Dec. 31, they are encouraged to receive it earlier in October or November. Flu vaccines are also required for HUHS employees.
Students who receive flu vaccines outside of an HUHS provider or flu clinic must submit proof through the patient portal to update their immunization records to enroll in spring classes, according to Newton.
The Massachusetts Department of Public Health removed its statewide flu vaccine mandate for K-12 and college students in January due to a mild flu season and a desire to focus on administering Covid-19 vaccines.
In addition to the four clinics hosted by the Cambridge Public Health Department, CVS began offering flu shots at its pharmacy and retail walk-in health clinic, MinuteClinic, in August. The location in Harvard Square is currently accepting appointments online.
Yellow posters plastered around the store read “2021 Flu Shots Now in Stock! Get Yours Today!” directing customers to make an appointment via text message.
Individuals who have tested positive for Covid-19 should postpone their flu shot until after the end of the recommended isolation period, according to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
CORRECTION: September 17, 2021 
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the flu vaccine is required for all Harvard employees. In fact, the flu vaccine is required for HUHS employees, but not all Harvard employees.

Campus life is back and buzzing, and whether you're new to the scene or returning after a Zoom hiatus, we can all identify with the burning question: what is the deal with BoardPlus? Maybe you miss the good ol’ pre-Covid days of BoardPlus, or maybe you have never even heard of it before clicking on this article. Either way, we’re here to tell you what it is, what has changed, and how to take advantage of it.
What The Heck Is BoardPlus?
Whether you’re a junior/senior and it’s been a while or a freshman/sophomore and you literally have no idea what we’re talking about, let me take you on a journey to (re-)discover the wonderful concept of ~BoardPlus~. Basically, each semester you’ll receive $65 on your HUID to use at specific HUDS- and House-operated dining. If you don’t use your $65 during the fall, no worries! It’ll roll right over to the next semester (but make sure you use it up before the last day of exams in the spring… otherwise, it’s gone forever 🥲). If you do leave it till the last minute, Flyby has proved that no amount of time is too small to blow all $130 left in your account (apparently, the LamCaf cakes are the move).
To clear up some common misconceptions – BoardPlus is different from Crimson Cash. Rather than money you transfer onto your HUID, BoardPlus is money already in your designated account that is included in your meal plan. While Crimson Cash is used for things like laundry, vending machines, printing, and designated dining locations that have partnered with Harvard, BoardPlus is exclusively for those sweet on-campus cafes and grilles. (To all of those wonderful students running for the UC pledging for BoardPlus to be used for laundry… sorry to disappoint). In order to use BoardPlus at eligible locations, simply let the person checking you out know and swipe your HUID!
Where Can I Use It?
In a normal year, there are a wide variety of open locations in which you can work through your $65 a semester. These locations include HUDS-operated cafes, House grilles, and even to pay for guest meals in the dhalls (perhaps your next romantic date with that BU student across the river?). But, Covid has put a real damper on this (cue a surprised gasp).
For now, you can use those precious BoardPlus dollars at the Laboratory for Integrated Science and Engineering (LISE) Café, Northwest Café over by the science buildings, and the SEC Café at our beautiful new Science and Engineering complex! And if you’re willing to check out some of our graduate schools near and far, options abound at their cafes and commons as well.
...So When Are Things Actually Reopening?
So far, it appears there is no official saving grace date in which we can expect our beloved House grilles to reopen so we can consume some well desired deep fried snacks. Currently, according to College spokesperson Rachael Dane, campus and city guidelines are being reviewed to determine when the best time to open the grilles will be... we can only hope this will be soon.
But, never fear, many of the HUDS-operated cafes on campus have been opening up over the last few weeks, with more to join in the coming weeks, too (bring back Barker Cafe please, RIP). In the meantime, we’ll be eagerly awaiting the return of some all-time Flyby favorites, from Quad Grille mozz sticks to Barker croissants to LamCaf Javiva’s.
