After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The language of finance can be insidious. Words like leverage and concepts like diversification can morph from narrow financial terms into much more general ways of understanding the world. For students that go into finance or business, the idea of “optionality” is particularly pliable—and taken too far, it can be downright dangerous.
I’ve lost count of the number of students who, when describing their career goals, talk about their desire to “maximize optionality.”  They’re referring to financial instruments known as options that confer the right to do something rather than an obligation to do something. For this reason, options have a “Heads I win, tails I don’t lose” character—what those in finance lovingly describe as a “nonlinear payoff structure.” When you hold an option and the world moves with you, you enjoy the benefits; when the world moves against you, you are shielded from the bad outcome since you are not obligated to do anything. Optionality is the state of enjoying possibilities without being on the hook to do anything.
For new graduates, working at a consulting firm creates optionality because of the broad exposures (to industries and companies) and skills these firms purportedly develop. Going to graduate school creates optionality by enabling more opportunities than a narrow professional trajectory can provide. Working at prestigious firms and developing social networks are similarly viewed as enabling more choices and more optionality. And of course, the more optionality, the better.
In contrast, the closing of doors and possibilities signals the loss of optionality. This language doesn’t only apply to career planning: Don’t be surprised to hear someone in finance talk about marriage as the death of optionality.
This emphasis on creating optionality can backfire in surprising ways. Instead of enabling young people to take on risks and make choices, acquiring options becomes habitual. You can never create enough option value—and the longer you spend acquiring options, the harder it is to stop.
The Yale undergraduate goes to work at McKinsey for two years, then comes to Harvard Business School, then graduates and goes to work Goldman Sachs and leaves after several years to work at Blackstone. Optionality abounds!
This individual has merely acquired stamps of approval and has acquired safety net upon safety net. These safety nets don’t end up enabling big risk-taking—individuals just become habitual acquirers of safety nets. The comfort of a high-paying job at a prestigious firm surrounded by smart people is simply too much to give up. When that happens, the dreams that those options were meant to enable slowly recede into the background. For a few, those destinations are in fact their dreams come true—but for every one of those, there are ten entrepreneurs, artists, and restaurateurs that get trapped in those institutions.
Of course, this is not a pitiable outcome. And in fact, maybe those serial options acquirers are simply masking a deep risk aversion that underlay their affinity for optionality. Even if not explicitly stated, optionality was always the end rather than a means to an end.
In fairness, these optionality-obsessed professionals often wind up happier than the other type I’ve become accustomed to seeing in my office: the lottery ticket buyers. These individuals are just one payday away from securing the resources they need to begin their work toward their true ambition, be it political, civic, or familial. They believe that one Silicon Valley startup or one stint at a hedge fund will allow them to begin their true journey.
While the serial option and lottery ticket buyers seem like different creatures, they are, in fact, close cousins. Both types postpone their dreams and undertake choices that they think will enable their dreams. But they fail to understand that all of these intervening choices will change them fundamentally—and they are, in fact, the sum total of those choices.
The shortest distance between two points is reliably a straight line. If your dreams are apparent to you, pursue them. Creating optionality and buying lottery tickets are not way stations on the road to pursuing your dreamy outcomes. They are dangerous diversions that will change you.
By emphasizing optionality, these students ignore the most important life lesson from finance: the pursuit of alpha. Alpha is the macho finance shorthand for an exemplary life. It is the excess return earned beyond the return required given risks assumed. It is finance nirvana.
But what do we know about alpha? In short, it is very hard to attain in a sustainable way and the only path to alpha is hard work and a disciplined dedication to a core set of beliefs. Given the ambiguity over the correct risk-adjusted benchmark, one never even knows if one has attained alpha. It is the golden ring just beyond your reach—and, one must enjoy the pursuit of alpha, given its fleeting and distant nature. Ultimately, finding a pursuit that can sustain that illusion of alpha is all we can ask for in a life’s work.

“When does an ending begin?” Harvard Professor Jill Lepore asks in her essay, “Wars Within,” published just after the 2016 presidential race. The beginning of the end is hard to see, she contends, exploring whether or not Donald Trump’s election signals the last of our country’s best days. It doesn’t, Lepore concludes: “Sparrows may yet cross the sky.”

Three years ago, the two of us experienced the beginning of an end—the end of our time as undergraduates at Harvard. We sat in the Yard, among classmates and professors and families and friends. We heard from distinguished speakers, we sweated in our gowns, and then we packed up our rooms and drove off to new beginnings.
Ben returned home to Texas where he reported for his hometown paper before joining a national organization dedicated to serving and advocating for refugees and asylum seekers. Tara moved to Chicago to work with a coalition of immigrant and refugee rights organizations.
Migration, like elections and graduations, is a story of endings and new beginnings. Before we were Harvard graduates, we were both newcomers to the United States. Ben was born in Mexico and moved to America with his family in 2003. Tara was born in Australia to Indian parents and arrived here in 1995. Our families migrated, leaving loved ones and traditions and jobs behind, for the same reason: an opportunity to build a better world for us.
You are graduating in a time of uncertainty—for people of various races, genders, sexual orientations. Uncertainty for people of different socioeconomic and immigration statuses. Uncertainty for institutions of higher education. And uncertainty for our world as we know it.
On the issue of immigration—close to our hearts, the subject of our work since graduation, and central to some of our nation’s most bitter debates—we are learning lessons on the trials and heartbreaking slowness of creating real change. We live in a period of unprecedented human mobility. 65 million people have been driven from their homes worldwide, including over 21 million refugees and 3 million asylum seekers.
And, in this context, within his first week in office, Trump signed an executive order banning travelers and refugees from seven majority-Muslim countries. In the first months of this year, crimes incited by the hateful hijacking of our politics killed several people of color. Trump’s administration arrested 41,318 undocumented people in its first 100 days; 11,000 of them had no criminal conviction. Joining a cadre of anti-immigrant states, Texas—where Ben and his family live now—this month passed Senate Bill 4, authorizing racial profiling in order to penalize immigrants without papers. And that’s just immigration.
What does it mean to come of age in a world that seems so divided that it may come apart entirely? You are among the luckiest people your age, the world over. What will you do with your privilege? What are you willing to sacrifice in pursuit of justice? Though we are a few years out of the seats you now occupy, we are with you in considering these questions, more urgent for our generation now than ever before. We don’t have the answers—but we are learning from the hope and perseverance we’ve observed in the movement we are both fortunate to work within.
Resist. But don’t stop there. It’s too easy to just criticize the world as it is. We have a responsibility to dream of and work towards the world as we believe it should be. If we are unhappy with our elected leaders, we need to develop and elect the ones we hope to see. If we are unsatisfied with the policies that govern our nations, we must demand better ones—and determine what they look like.
Begin a chapter of your life with the people beyond these gates. Know what you don’t know—and seek answers in places and from people you haven’t encountered before. Identify ways to share your privileges and resources. When people talk about immigration reform, they tend to focus on people like us: Ivy League graduates, brought to America early in life, unaccented and unencumbered. Upend the institutions and narratives that praise us for our degrees but exclude those who didn’t have our access.
Though often it feels like it, our world is not ending. We must not believe that our best days are past. But, as our time as active participants in society begins, divides deepen and resentment festers. Our generation’s struggle for the world we want is just beginning. Congratulate yourselves on your accomplishments—and then get to work building the world as you believe it should be.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I arrived at Harvard in the fall of 1996, climbed up to my single room on the top floor of Greenough Hall, and delighted in its near-monastic severity.  Here, at last, was a place where I could be the boy I always wanted to be.
Up until that moment (or so it felt) I had been hounded, dragged down, by my past self—specifically, my past self as a girl. For 17 years, I had struggled with the gender identity society put on me, trying to negotiate childhood as a tomboy and adolescence as a butch lesbian.  At 17, I had finally come out as transgender and transitioned to living as a boy.  But for that first year as a guy, my past had been inescapable: I continued on for my senior year at a high school where I had attended previously as a girl. I even stayed playing on my girls’ sports teams (although, when I took my helmet off at the end of ice hockey games, opposing coaches would often register complaints that there was a boy on the team).  Most people were polite and tried to get my pronouns right, but I knew that when they looked at me, they still saw a girl, at least in part.
Harvard represented the chance to finally go stealth, to get away from what I had been. Even this chance had been precarious. When I had been interviewed by an alumnus, all had gone well—I wore a coat and tie, we talked about an economics class I was taking—until he picked up my transcript and noted my legal name: Alice. Though tempted to explain that my parents were Alice Cooper fans, I opted for the truth, that I was transgender. And he exploded. Harvard sent a second interviewer, and I got in. As the second interview was conducted, and when the Dean’s office called to follow up about housing options, I was aware that I was out, that the administration knew I was transgender—the first openly transgender student in Harvard’s history—and I wasn’t sure I wanted to be that.
“Everyone else just gets to be themselves. Why do I have to carry this additional banner?” That’s what I felt like. So I put it down. No more long and tangled conversations about gender identity and expression. No more arguing about whether biology was destiny. I would just be a boy. I resented my girl self; I wanted to be done with it.
I think this feeling is not unique to transgender people. I think this is an impulse all of us feel at some time and in some way: the desire to shed a past skin, to transform into another self. A better self. A self we tell ourselves is truer. It is a Siren’s song.
That fall at Harvard, I turned out to be wrong. I lived as a boy. I told no one about my past. I took my classes and played tuba in the marching band and went for long runs along the river. There was a certain freedom in just being a boy. Except I wasn’t just a boy. And as the year stretched out, the more it felt that I was hiding something, withholding a crucial part of myself. And the feeling of hiding, of keeping something secret, is never good. What to do with the secrets we don’t want to share?
Most of us, at some point, have a hard time meeting the gaze in the mirror.  Most of us, at some point, wish to fall off the map of ourselves.  Most of us, at some point, want to become someone else.
But that urge—though nearly universal—is a dangerous one. Instead of the imagined freedom, I found a different kind of confinement. It wasn’t exactly a lie that I was trapped in, just a partial truth.
Eventually, well before the end of my first year at Harvard, I came out. First to friends, and then by joining the BGLT Student Association (they added the T), and eventually by starting a small Transgender Task Force and starting to advocate for changes, like the inclusion of gender identity in the College’s non-discrimination charge. It felt risky, as coming out always does, but it also felt empowering. In fact, through coming out, I gained the freedom that I had imagined I would find by going stealth and living as a boy.
It has taken me awhile to let this message fully sink in. It took a couple other stints of stealth living—working for the Forest Service in Wyoming, teaching English down in Florida—before I realized the extent of the truth. And it is a truth not just for transgender people, but for everyone, particularly those who are about to walk out of one realm and have the chance to start anew. There is allure to the idea of becoming someone else. But it is so much more important to become yourself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As far as transformative experiences go, Harvard Square has had a remarkable one. Over the past few years, newer and more expensive businesses have slowly taken the place of older, more affordable establishments.
Of course, stores, restaurants, and shops routinely go out of business and are replaced. This is not a new phenomenon—it is the natural result of any commercial location. More worrying is the trend: a Harvard Square that caters to a more affluent clientele, one composed of tourists and students with money to spend.
Unfortunately, this disproportionately impacts the lives of Harvard students who come from low-income backgrounds and who do not have the money to patronize these businesses. Some students find themselves shut out from restaurants that become off-campus social spaces, furthering the socioeconomic divides already present in the student body.
THE CHANGING FACE OF HARVARD SQUARE
Over the past year, affordable locations have given way to expensive alternatives: Frozen yogurt store Pinkberry became Pressed Juicery, a cold-pressed juice bar. Panera Bread was replaced by Tatte, a European-style bakery. The Crimson reported in February that upscale Amorino Gelato is looking to purchase a storefront on JFK Street. Blue Bottle Coffee, a cafe specializing single-origin coffee, announced its arrival in the Square last December; one undergraduate described the news “yet another bougie addition to Harvard Square.”
Some Harvard students have wholeheartedly embraced this change, with lines at Tatte out the door (especially during the HUDS strike last fall). Not everyone can enjoy these new food spots, though, and the enthusiasm of some students towards these expensive eateries puts more pressure on their less wealthy peers to seem content with the change.
Harvard Square is becoming a popular location for internationally renowned restaurant chains, but not without a price. Increased demand for storefronts has put pressure on unique establishments with decades of history in the Square. In September of 2016, the world’s only Curious George store narrowly avoided threats of eviction for the sake of remodeling its prime real estate. This February, Crimson Corner, a 54-year-old family-owned fixture, was forced to relocate to a different location in favor of a Washington-based made-to-order pizza eatery. The 161-year-old foreign language bookstore Schoenhof’s shuttered its doors in March, citing high rents.
The Square is known for its historic nature, but many key features of the area cannot withstand the monetary pressure that developers and national chains bring. Though the Cambridge City Council passed several resolutions reaffirming its and its constituents’ dedication to preserving Harvard Square’s historic character, that is difficult when rising rents and exorbitant land values force out businesses that are decades-old mainstays in favor of trendy coffee shops.
There is undoubtedly a great tension between Harvard Square’s historical ties and commercial interests. The University attracts numerous tourists every day, and often they seek high-end food to supplement their sightseeing. Cambridge as a whole is also undergoing gentrification, as are many other areas of Boston, so Harvard Square is not necessarily an outlier. And as we have opined in the past, development in the Square must always be a compromise between increasing economic opportunities and a commitment to the historic significance and affordability of the area. There is a way of imagining the future of the Square and its restaurants while conserving critical pieces of its long, expansive past.
THE IMPACT ON STUDENTS
The upward trend of prices for lunch in the Square mark an undeniable social burden on less wealthy Harvard students who have less disposable cash to spend. The result is that they cannot join friends for meals outside of dining halls.
This is not merely an issue of affordability but also one of general food accessibility. Many Harvard affiliates do not have access to dining halls provided by the College—namely graduate students—and for them, affordable, substantive food is hard to come by around campus. There are no major grocery stores in the Square, and very few locations sell ingredients and staple foods. The Department of Agriculture has classified Harvard Square as a “low-access” food zone.
This does not merely affect graduate students, however. Undergraduates who live on campus have spoken of the difficulty of purchasing affordable, fresh, and nutritious foods, and this problem only worsens when dining halls are not available during breaks. During the most recent Spring Break, for example, low-income students were offered a stipend for dining options in the form of Crimson Cash, which is usable at relatively few nutritious and affordable locations. A more homogenous and upscale Square thus provides little flexibility for many low-income students.
These issues are exacerbated by the growth of expensive, exclusive businesses around Harvard Square that raise questions about the future of the area. The Square is inextricably linked to the image of Harvard as well as the realities of it. It is a commercial area that serves two very different groups of people—the students who attend Harvard and live on the surrounding campus as well as the tourists from across the world who visit it.
Sadly, the increasing presence of expensive stores benefits neither. As historic locations are replaced by bourgeois chains, Harvard Square loses the unique charm that sets it apart and in part attracts tourists.
Moving forward, the administration must recognize that concerns of affordability in the Square are relevant to the student population. Initiatives from the College like the new start-up grant for freshmen—a stipend to those whose families $65,000 or less—are a helpful start.
More is needed, however, starting with an expansion of the program. Right now, it is a pilot that is only guaranteed to freshmen until the Class of 2022. It also applies solely to freshmen, yet the struggles of low-income students do not disappear when they move out of the Yard. Finally, we would encourage the administration to reconsider the monetary threshold to include more students, a critical step in supporting students who fall just above the $65,000 line.
We believe the solution cannot rely solely on the administration, however. Though they have steps to take, part of the responsibility falls on the student body. Undergraduates must be cognizant of their peers’ financial situation when making lunch plans or setting up meetings for an organization. Students could opt to eat in a dining hall, for example, rather than a coffee shop with $5 espressos. By practicing empathy and sensibility, individuals can take action to help curb the class-based divisions that an increasingly expensive Harvard Square may bring.
The transformation of Harvard Square in recent years is clear, and it is highly likely that this trend towards expensive eateries will continue. This change impacts the everyday lives of low-income students at Harvard, and we believe it is necessary for the administration to help support these students. As Harvard Square becomes defined by trendier and more upscale stores and restaurants, it is important that all Harvard students still feel comfortable on their campus. We can all do our part to keep up with the cycle of changing storefronts that is beginning to characterize the once historic Harvard Square.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the past decades, Harvard College has become remarkably more diverse: In the current Class of 2020, half are female and almost half identify as non-white. But while admissions have successfully diversified Harvard’s student population, this new class of students has been left without commensurate support in the classroom. Although Harvard boasts a diverse student body, progress in diversifying faculty and curriculum has fallen decades behind, failing to keep pace with the changing demographics of undergraduates.
Initiatives have been prompting change too slowly, reflected in the majority of tenured Harvard faculty who are white males. Students still express the need for more diverse curricula, and the University still lacks an Ethnic Studies program. We believe the status quo should not continue. Instead, Harvard should re-commit to diversifying its faculty and push for a more diverse curriculum. These efforts are necessary for Harvard to live up to the promise of a liberal arts education and for it to better serve its diverse student body.
THE PATH FORWARD ON FACULTY DIVERSITY
Harvard has long touted the diversity of its student body as an indicator of intellectual rigor, opportunity for personal growth, and the strength of its community. Efforts to broaden the backgrounds of the faculty who teach, mentor, and support these students, however, has lagged significantly behind.
Currently, white males represent the majority—60.8 percent—of tenured faculty, with Asian males making up 8.2 percent and underrepresented minorities rounding out the section of male tenured professors with 5.2%. Among female tenured professors, the lack of diversity is just as stark: white females represent the largest portion at 20.4 percent, Asian females make up 2.9 percent, and underrepresented minority females have a mere 2.5 percent of the total tenured professor population. These figures sharply contrast with the composition of the latest admitted undergraduate student body, where 28.1 percent identified as an underrepresented minority and 22.2 percent as Asian American.
The tenure track, an indicator of the future composition of tenured faculty, is made up of 5.2 percent underrepresented minority females, 8.4 percent Asian females, and 25.8 percent white females. Underrepresented minority males make up 6.1 percent, Asian males compose 12.3 percent, and white males are 42.3 percent. Laws surrounding interview practices make reliable data on faculty identifying as BGLTQ unavailable. While these trends are a commendable improvement over the last decade, it is only the beginning of the progress Harvard needs to make.
The need for more diverse faculty is twofold. First, success in academia is exceedingly demanding, with its demands for original insights, productive research, and masterful teaching. Female faculty, faculty of color, and BGLTQ faculty face the added barrier of often feeling isolated in scholarly communities dominated by white males, where they report both feeling respected and accepted but also sensing implicit challenges to their presence. With the struggle to find peers of a similar background and experience comes a struggle to find and foster community and support. Our world-class faculty deserve better.
BGLTQ students, students of color, and female students face a similar struggle when they see few faculty with whom to relate. They can question their place or future in academia as a result. Currently, the comparatively few diverse faculty willingly take on a disproportionate advising burden in an effort to mentor these students, but doing so necessarily distracts from their careers. Students deserve more support, and although faculty receive recognition for their exceptional mentorship, they need help to maintain this network for the long term.
Harvard also stands to benefit: Intellectual diversity and broader research activity will be aided by a more diverse faculty. A 1995 faculty survey administered by UCLA’s Higher Education Research Institute demonstrated that minorities in higher positions of academic authority have “expanded and enriched scholarship,” in part due to their introduction of different perspectives that give rise to novel concerns and interpretations.
Other studies have shown that female faculty and faculty of color engage in more “student-centered pedagogy” than their counterparts, resulting in an increase in student engagement that stimulates growth in intellectual and academic skills. These qualities—characteristic of deepened critical thinking and academic insight—are vital for undergraduates.
A BROADER CURRICULUM
By Harvard developing a more diverse professoriate, both students and faculty stand to benefit immensely. This is not, however, the only instance of diversification that can aid our community. The introduction of curricular opportunities at the College that include the narratives and perspectives of people of color, underrepresented minority groups, and BGLTQ communities will serve as a purposeful and effective attempt at further diversification.
This lack of curriculum diversity is not new. In 2010, former Crimson editorial writer Sabrina G. Lee ’12 claimed that the Social Studies 10 “syllabus is comprised almost exclusively of white, European, heterosexual male theorists.” In 2015, the report written by the University-appointed working group on Diversity and Inclusion highlighted several major issues with the current academic offerings. The report found that out of thousands of course offerings, a mere 217 “critically engage with issues of identity and difference.” The majority of these courses were offered in the social sciences, which still struggle with a dearth of non-Western perspectives.
These issues have not fallen completely on deaf ears. This year, for example, the English Department approved a motion to include a concentration requirement that would require students to take at least one course featuring authors that have been “marginalized for historical reasons” including “racism, patriarchy, and heteronormativity.” We commend the move and hope that other departments take critically important steps in efforts to diversify their syllabi.
A broader curriculum would help develop cultural competency in students, a crucial factor in the educational growth of the next generation that has rarely been more significant. A focused effort to include courses that discuss the narratives of marginalized minority groups challenges the predilection of  historical works and the Western canon that currently make up the bread-and-butter of many Harvard classes.
The synthesis of more perspectives would provide students with a breadth and depth of insight to analyze the ways in which phenomena like imperialism, racism, and white supremacy have molded both the narrowed educational scope provided by the College and the ways in which students interact with this information. Moreover, integrating these voices into curricula lessens the feeling of tokenism attributed to students who belong to these specific groups. Instead of often being asked to represent an entire ethnic or racial group, the weight of cultural and ethnic representation can be shifted off of their shoulders and onto syllabi.
THE NEED FOR ETHNIC STUDIES
When discussing curriculum, one omission is particularly glaring: Harvard does not have an Ethnic Studies program. The discipline got its start at San Francisco State University in the late 1960s, but Harvard has woefully lagged behind. Since 1972, students and faculty have worked on various proposals to bring Ethnic Studies to campus, but the efforts have been largely unsuccessful. Indeed, Harvard falls far behind many of its peer institutions.
It is disappointing that a place hailed as one of the premier universities in the world would lack a robust Ethnic Studies program. The Committee on Ethnicity, Migration, Rights offers a secondary degree, with the option to choose a track in Latinx Studies, but it cannot hire ladder faculty. History and Literature recently announced that concentrators would be able to choose to do an Ethnic Studies track as well. While this reflects decades of student activism and is a welcome addition, it is ultimately inadequate. Like the EMR secondary, the track within History and Literature cannot add professors and the requisite courses.
The push for a strong, institutionalized Ethnic Studies program, ideally in the form of a department, is closely tied to the need for a more diverse faculty and curriculum. Being a discipline largely concerned with issues of race and ethnicity, an Ethnic Studies department would inherently fill existing gaps in the curriculum with challenging and culturally competent courses. In 2015, 66% of recipients of Ethnic Studies degrees in the United States were women. The majority of individuals who received degrees in Ethnic Studies were black or Latino. By having a fully fledged department with the ability to hire tenure track faculty and conduct groundbreaking research, issues of faculty and curriculum diversity would be greatly improved.
Students coming from historically underrepresented backgrounds should not have to bear the unwelcome onus of teaching their experiences to their peers. Through the broadening of the perspectives of both faculty and curricula, all students would be offered the opportunity to learn in a manner that incorporated diverse thought and celebrated a variety of experience.
Faculty and curriculum diversity are inextricably tied. Harvard could lessen the burden on students from underrepresented minority backgrounds while offering a broader education to their peers of privileged backgrounds. The entire student body would benefit, and Harvard would be better positioned to realize its promise of an expansive liberal arts education. The University has both the means and the ability to achieve these goals; all it needs is recognition of the needs of its students and a true commitment to diversification.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Here are some wayward thoughts about our current predicament—er, politics: President Trump will not be removed from office any time soon, if ever; journalists, not politicians, have so far been the agents of accountability; the depths of this administration’s dysfunction have not yet been fully documented; but while the Democrats could retake the House in 2018, it will be harder than many think; the Senate will stay in GOP hands until at least 2020, a year in which Trump still has a real chance of getting reelected; meantime, yes, you have a moral duty to get involved in civil society—or at least to buy a newspaper subscription. The Trump presidency is proving the wisdom of Charlie Allnut’s timeless line, “Things are never so bad they can’t be made worse.” Happy commencement!
The rest of this op-ed is the story of why, astonishingly, I get paid to have opinions about these sorts of things.
It was the summer of 2006, and I had walked into the Washington Post building for the first time just a few hours before. Welcomed by personalities that I had known only as bylines or faces on Meet The Press, I was nervous and elated. I had already taken to Washington, with its charming brick neighborhoods and marble monuments that glistened in reflection on the Potomac River. I quickly discovered that C-Span is on the radio (!) here. Everyone I met seemed to have a strong opinion on healthcare policy. Why had I taken a U.K. fellowship after graduating instead of coming to this wonderland immediately?
By lunchtime, I was heading to a meal with my “professional partner,” a famous journalist I had wanted to meet for years, whom the paper had picked to guide me through my summer internship in the editorial pages.
He had only one piece of advice for me: “Go to law school.”
Then he asked what I wanted to do. “I want to be an editorial writer,” I said.
“Well,” he replied, “at least you know what you want.”
In fairness, I had a weirdly specific dream. Professional editorial boards are few and small, and they have a stodgy reputation. Jobs writing the unsigned, voice-of-the-staff opinion pieces that run under newspaper mastheads are traditionally reserved for newsroom veterans with recognition and gravitas. Would they even exist in a couple decades? If they did, would they matter? With characteristic snark, blogger Andrew Sullivan would assert in 2011 that “Anyone in the younger generation who yearns for a column on the Washington Post op-ed page is seeking oblivion,” dismissing (wrongly, it turned out) the relevance of newspaper opinion writing.
But I loved the ideal of the Editorial Board: a collective of smart people who have no motive but to get to the right position, rather than the most provocative or partisan one. Bylines inevitably alter content and tone. Signed opinion pieces are about the author; editorials are about the ideas.
So I took a different colleague’s advice: “If you have no social life and write all the time, maybe your editor will keep you on,” he suggested. This was not hard for me. My editor warned that he could not offer me a permanent job—no budget—but I stuck around as long as I could.
I worked a lot and got paid little. I wrote on temporary contracts, worked two jobs, and rented a basement apartment a hike from downtown Washington. For several years, I would help run the section’s web operations during the day and write editorials in my free time. I proved my enthusiasm, if nothing else. But I was in the city with C-Span radio, in the building where Watergate broke, in the room where the Editorial Board crafted its unbylined articles.
I reminded my editor about once a year what I wanted. “You know I can pump out pieces,” I said, “and I’m young and cheap.” Something about that pitch eventually worked. After several years, he put me on the Board full time.
The truth is I got my dream job mostly because I was lucky. I have a great boss committed to cultivating younger writers. I was also in the right place at the right time. But I would not have been in the building if I had not stubbornly put myself there. So go where you want to be. Ask for what you want. Otherwise, you might have to go to law school.*
*But maybe that’s a thing you actually want to do, in which case, great!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard. One word that signifies excellence in education. Now, I love my alma mater, Northwestern University. However, as a millennial like you, and as a young Black man born and raised in the Bronx, the son of Jamaican Immigrants, it was an indescribable honor to be a Fall Fellow of the Institute of Politics at Harvard. I was able to spend time with you, remarkable students who are transforming the world for the better. Your graduation shall give someone from your hometown the belief that they can achieve any dream. Your talents will take you to careers that provide game changing impact for generations present and unborn. As a Harvard graduate, you are continuing to overcome the odds which allows you to be a face of hope to countless fellow descendants of justice and equity. You have the responsibility to ensure that the education you have received will teach others how to remove the clouds of despair to only see a sky of opportunity and to focus not just on today but days to come as you promote a vision of legacy building, not resume building.
On the journey to graduation, there are many ups and downs that occur. I was with you on November 9, the day after an election that lead so many people to lose hope. However, the way you came together for conversations and reflections on how we move forward strengthened my hope in the direction of this country. As a Harvard graduate, you can appreciate our history of overcoming the odds as a people for the greater good. From marching with Congressman John Lewis and showing it to students on Skype to listening to your dreams and aspirations during office hours, you restored my faith in dreaming big dreams and my confidence that Harvard graduates will realize them for a society. It's a continual story known as the path to progress.
The first line in our chapter of history has already been written, but we still control the ending. The graduating Harvard Class of 2017 will be among the leaders who shape the story moving forward, as you will be “in the room where it happens.” Guided by our principles, we stand steadfast in the belief that we have the power to change the world. Let this day be cemented in your mind as the day that the Class of 2017 went forth into the world and made a decision to make it better.
President John F. Kennedy ’40 understood that importance, and the privilege of his chapter of history. During his Inaugural Address, he said, “In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger. I do not shrink from this responsibility—I welcome it.” As graduates of Harvard College, you have a remarkable responsibility to your community, your country, and the world. Now, as in times past, we face multiple threats to freedom and democracy, both foreign and domestic. You will be expected to defend the rights and freedoms which we hold dear, find new and innovative ways to improve lives, and create an equitable and just society. I encourage you to take on that duty with the courage of your convictions, standing boldly in the face of adversity, and with the willingness to speak truth to power.
President Kennedy went on to say, “The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it—and the glow from that fire can truly light the world.” Your graduation from Harvard shows that you are chosen to be the ones that provide hope for a generation. Let the call go forth for the Class of 2017 to rise to its true potential and meet the challenges of our day.
Jim Wallis wrote the transformational book, “God's Politics”, and concluded it by beautifully saying, “We are the ones we have been waiting for.” You have been waiting for this moment. Congratulations. But I speak for generations across our spectrum of time by saying that I’m grateful in advance because the moment we have been waiting for is the arrival of the latest generation of visionaries. My heart is full, for that moment is now here. Because of you. Because of Harvard. Because of what you achieve after today, I say thank you.
Michael A. Blake is the New York State Assembly member of the 79th District in The Bronx, N.Y. and Vice Chair of the Democratic National Committee. He was a Fellow at the Institute of Politics in the fall of 2016. Follow him on Twitter @mrmikeblake.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s hard to believe that it’s been 30 years this month since I celebrated my own Harvard Commencement. Our speaker was Richard von Weizsacker, President of the Federal Republic of Germany. This year’s commencement speaker was likely not yet in kindergarten then.  I remember very clearly the time leading right up to the May festivities as I finished my thesis, originally started on a typewriter and, thankfully, finished on something new and crazy called a “Mac.”
My mom and several of my nine siblings were able to fly in from California and join me for an unforgettable week of celebrations and Boston tourist activities that I never had a chance to tackle until then. I returned to the Bay Area and my interest in real estate and community development took off from there. As I transition from my most recent position as Treasurer of the United States and prepare for my thirty-year Harvard reunion this fall, the words that come to my mind are gratitude and renewed anticipation.
I have been given so many gifts from my Harvard experience.  My Winthrop House roommates, Julie and Natalie, remain my best friends to date.  I clearly remember being told that it is the people at Harvard who make the biggest difference, and these two are beyond any expectations I have ever had. We have been through thick and thin and have attended just about every reunion together. Today, we continue to live vicariously through each other’s families and career paths.  They allowed me to feel safe at Harvard and to take strategic risks. After several years of planning, they, along with my Winthrop friends Lisa and Lynn and the Harvard Foundation, helped and supported the launch of Cultural Rhythms in 1986, a student celebration that continues to this day.
College is definitely the time to take those risks, a time to find yourself, to question your identity and what you value. And coming to the foreign land of Cambridge made it that much more interesting. It wasn’t easy leaving home. It wasn’t easy trying to figure out how I wanted to spend my time socially, academically, and emotionally. I learned very quickly that it is a two-way street.  You get what you give. But the biggest lesson that I learned that still motivates me today is that human capital is the best investment that you can make.  It is about the people. Harvard invested in me. It means so much to me that Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 and Senior Admissions Officer David L. Evans, with whom I worked in the Admissions Office, are still there investing in future students.
My classmate and friend Becky E. F. Wassarman is the Executive Director of Academic Ventures at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard where I am now a Visiting Scholar. Dr. S. Allen Counter remains the Director of the Harvard Foundation and he and David are responsible for the commission of my portrait at Winthrop House.  And it means everything that I still keep in touch with Lisa Quiroz ’83, the Harvard Admissions Officer who recruited me over 34 years ago.
It motivates me to continue to give back—to think about inspiring the next generation of leadership.  Would my life have been the same if I did not attend Harvard?  A completely rhetorical question, but my guess is no. I felt empowered to bring up new ideas and find the support systems to execute them. I appreciated that I was the first person to ever graduate with the combination of my two majors. I was able to build the confidence to choose my unique career path and most recently lead the efforts to place a woman on our Federal Reserve notes for the first time in our country’s history. Looking back over these last thirty years, I feel completely blessed.
And now I get to relive it all over again through my son Joey, who just finished his sophomore year in Adams House. He has found his own set of best friends who will likely remain just as close through the next thirty years. He is happy. I remember that when I came here there were few students who looked like me. But that did not deter me—it emboldened me to contribute my unique perspective.  Joey is finding that same voice. I’ll never forget the first time I read his Harvard application and the essay entitled, “A Tale of Two Grandmas.”
He wrote about his grandmother from Hokkaido, Japan and his grandmother from Guadalajara, Mexico.  He did not focus on their differences, but instead, how they raised him with common values and an emphasis on family, food, and faith.  I learned a lot about him that day and perhaps a lot about myself as well. If we start to think about each of us as all the different threads that weave together to become the fabric of our community, we could actually have a constructive conversation about our American culture and the values on which our country was founded. It is about putting people first and respecting each and every aspect of culture, however one wants to define it.
Through my own Harvard experience, I was able to learn the true meaning of culture then and today. For this next generation of Harvard graduates, the ones who will stand out as true leaders are those who can connect with people, empathizing and articulating the human experience. Harvard is now over 380 years old; when Joey, Julie, Natalie, and I return again for Harvard’s 400th, it will be amazing to see how the Harvard community continues to invest in people to impact our nation and beyond.  We are all truly blessed, and it is incumbent upon all of us to continue to support and inspire future generations.
Rosie G. Rios ’87 was the 43rd Treasurer of the United States and is a visiting scholar at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This academic year has been dominated by debate—often diplomatic, often not—on free speech, a term which itself has rapidly become politicized. We have opined on the topic on numerous occasions, both when it has affected our own campus and when it has affected colleges across the nation.
We stand by our prior opinion: Not all speakers are equally worth hearing; all have the right to be heard.
We believe that controversial speakers have the right to expound upon whatever claims they desire—including those that we believe to be offensive and factually wrong. This is their right of free speech, and we wholeheartedly support it. Any infringement on any person’s speech, however odious that speech might be, is a threat to the free expression that has fueled our democracy.
We have seen far too many incidents of individuals with controversial beliefs facing violent protests upon their arrival. This March at Middlebury College, Charles Murray—the author of the book, “The Bell Curve,” which alleges that there are genetically-rooted intellectual disparities between different ethnicities—and  interviewer Professor Allison Stanger were attacked by protesters after his speech. Stanger was hospitalized and later said that she feared for her life. In the face of these and other violent protests, we condemn such violence unequivocally. That we find Murray’s views patently offensive and bigoted makes, and should make, no difference. Hateful speech does not excuse retaliatory violence.
These incidents, however, are not themselves damning evidence that colleges are simply bastions of liberal privilege or that free speech is under siege. It is unfortunate that these protests are exploited by certain news outlets that choose to ignore the many respectful, peaceful, and law-abiding protests where students voice disagreement with a speaker. Indeed, the right to peaceably assemble is codified in the same amendment as the right to free speech. We urge those who object to the mere act of protest, including of a speaker whom one finds distasteful, to remember that protest too is an act of free speech.
We also believe that the essential definition of free speech has itself been twisted and clouded. Free speech only entails the right of every individual to “speak freely.” It does not give one the right to speak free of criticism or protest. It does not give one the right to say something which could reasonably be construed as inciting chaos or violence. It does not give one the right to any forum that one desires.
Milo Yiannopoulos, for instance, is free to launch his tirades against Muslims, women, and African Americans—but he does not have an automatic right to be invited to continue those tirades at some of this country’s most well-respected institutions of learning. Certain speakers do not deserve the platform Harvard University offers, especially when their rhetoric runs antithetical to the values we should all hold dear.
We also believe that students should have the ability to engage in dialogue with controversial speakers. When the Harvard Financial Analysts Club invited indicted pharmaceuticals businessman Martin Shkreli, we criticized them for failing to allow open discourse by limiting the kinds of questions that could be asked and attempting to bar the press. Students and speakers alike would gain from an opportunity to challenge the views of one another. Free speech is made better and richer by a lively exchange of ideas. In short, we are in support of free speech, but not free rein.
For students and others who disagree—sometimes vehemently—with those invited, we encourage nonviolent, legal protest. Those who have time and again proven themselves to be peddlers of hate and cruelty should have to defend their views as the price of a Harvard lectern. Individuals and events that will challenge the beliefs of controversial speakers and students are central pillars to keeping both accountable. Without student activism, speakers could espouse hateful rhetoric that often contradicts the norms we share as a campus. It is paramount that controversial speakers—on both the left and the right—are met with contradictory student voices.
We acknowledge that often the burden of confronting objectionable views falls on members of the student body unequally. In particular, students who feel that their identity or culture are routinely attacked may feel uniquely hurt by a speaker who questions an intrinsic part of who they believe themselves to be. Racist or sexist rhetoric, for example, would be more shocking to those who have never heard such views expressed than students who belong to the marginalized groups in question and are intimately familiar with those kinds of hateful speech.
All students, not just those who feel under attack, should step up and challenge speakers who question or attack their peers’ identities and cultures. It can be difficult and exhausting to be constantly forced to defend inherent things about oneself, especially traits that are immutable. The debate over free speech offers an unique chance for all to support and encourage constructive speech and discourage the politics of hate.
Campus organizations should likewise resist the urge to invite a contentious speaker purely for the sake of generating controversy. Speakers such as Milo Yiannopoulos have previously engaged in tactics we find offensive, such as outing a trans-woman at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Others, such as Martin Shkreli, have been arrested for securities fraud and are unlikely to offer helpful (or lawful) financial advice to the Harvard Financial Analysts Club. It seems the primary purpose of inviting such speakers is an organization’s selfish desire to generate publicity and controversy.
This does not and should not mean universities should aim to foster a particular political ideology on their campuses. We welcome the invitation of a diverse range of voices, and indeed believe that many colleges could benefit from hearing more conservative speakers. Instead, we question the decision of many student groups to invite hatemongers—either liberal or conservative—in the name of academic diversity. These speakers do not well represent any school of thought and have built careers on being mere provocateurs. If a student group makes the choice to invite that guest to campus, they have a right to do so, but they should not go unquestioned in making that choice.
The Constitution’s protections of speech are broad and expansive, yet the desirable and the Constitutionally-protected do not always align. That the First Amendment protects the freedom of young children to curse, of politicians to lie, of conspiracy theorists to peddle their tales, and even of neo-Nazis to march does not make any of those things desirable.
To us, the caliber of speakers invited to our campus sends a message about what views are accepted and acceptable. When speakers are intellectually lazy, unnecessarily cruel, or outright vindictive, they sanction that type of behavior as encouraged. The proper response is not to stifle their voices by physically barring such speakers or shouting them down. If invited, they must be allowed to come.
Yet it is perfectly within the boundaries of free speech to be thoughtful in those we invite. Much the same way, one’s acceptance of admission to the College indicates an acceptance of the diversity of backgrounds and opinions here, including those widely different from our own. That is the beauty and benefit of a school like Harvard. It requires being empathetic with and thoughtful about our peers, including when making decisions about who to invite to campus as a speaker.
The freedom of speech is a national treasure, one of the founding ideals of American democracy, and the bedrock of a free press. Indeed, these pages are made possible by those principles. Yet to preserve and protect free speech requires effort and care. To cultivate rich and educational discourse demands still more consideration. It is up to the members of this community—Harvard’s students, faculty, administrators, staff, and alumni—to work to build the conditions that will encourage thoughtful and productive conversations in pursuit of truth.

In the year following a contentious presidential election, it might be expected that the Harvard John F. Kennedy School of Government would emerge as an institution committed to funneling its graduates towards public service.
But the Kennedy School’s role extends far beyond simply responding to domestic and international politics—it claims to actively play a role in enhancing  “public interest.”
At its founding during the Great Depression, the Kennedy School bore a novel responsibility: to prepare college graduates for service in the ranks of government and civil service.
However, in the last several decades, destinations of Kennedy School alumni have dramatically diversified alongside growing diversity of its applicant pool–its student body now represents more than 80 countries, and graduates have traded government ID badges for offices in consulting firms.
With the school’s new global influence comes a major shift away from the traditional government and public sector jobs that most Kennedy School alumni once called home, though administrators say they are not uncomfortable with this trend.
As the Kennedy School’s fundraising efforts continue and the school pours its money into technology and entrepreneurship initiatives, some say the future provides an opportunity to educate future leaders and policymakers, even if that education looks beyond careers in government.
Despite what some might consider a need to place students into politics, the Kennedy School now more broadly attempts to prepare their students for work in both public and private sectors.
Students pursue a wide range of career paths after graduation: According to the school’s survey data, 86 percent of 2016 graduates chose to work at an employer that did not hire anyone else from their class.
Additionally, 54 percent of Kennedy School graduates go into the public sector and work in government and non-profits, while 43 percent find themselves in the private sector. Jobs in consulting drew the second highest percentage of recent alumni, with 20 percent of the Kennedy School’s Class of 2016 joining firms. Prestigious firms McKinsey & Company and Boston Consulting Group alone hired 40 graduates.
Other industries, like education and research, meanwhile drew interest in single digit percentiles.
But Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf  said he does not believe job sector placement statistics paint a complete picture. He noted that certain jobs that might officially be considered part of for-profit enterprises are “very directly advancing public purpose.”
For Elmendorf, these seemingly differing jobs still reflect a commitment to public good.
“The Financial Times is a company, but if you’re writing for the Financial Times about economic policy around the world, that is 100 percent public service from my perspective,” Elmendorf said. “Moreover, people who go to work for companies like McKinsey will spend part of their careers often advising governments.”
Kennedy School professor Daniel Deming added that he sees public service as having a broader definition outside of traditional government jobs.
“Public service does not just mean working in the public sector, it means working to advance the common good, advancing the idea of promoting the public interest,” he said.
Kennedy School student Vikram Janardhan said his time at the Kennedy School has expanded his conception of public service.
“The Kennedy School does a great job of introducing you to all of the paths by which you can do social good. Paths that you may not have considered,” Janardhan said.
High numbers of private sector alumni does not mean that the school turns its back on traditional political activism.
This activism can be seen in some students’ response to November’s election. Earlier this spring, a group of Kennedy School students created the “Resistance School,” styling themselves off characters from Harry Potter to spread techniques on resisting President Donald Trump’s administration.
Efforts to protest Trump at the Kennedy School have coincided with the arrival of former staffers from former President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton’s presidential campaigns. Former United Nations ambassador Samantha J. Power and Jason Furman ’92, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, now find themselves at the school.
Former Democratic staffers helped to launch the Resistance School, and former Obama adviser Sara El-Amine and Democratic National Committee Vice Chair Michael A. Blake spoke to students about tactics for political activism.
“Student activism is central to student life at HKS. I am proud to be part of a community where the norm and expectation is not only to identify problems, but also to try to fix them,” Kennedy School student Kelly L. Clark wrote in an email.
The Kennedy School is committed to promoting the “public good” in any number of spheres, Elmendorf said, adding that he recognizes in a changing international climate, the school may have to amend the way it goes about achieving this goal.
The Kennedy School has recently seen a spike in donations, which Elmendorf attributed in part to donors’ recognition of  a need to train public leaders and government officials.
As part of a Harvard-wide capital campaign, the Kennedy School raised $580 million by March, far surpassing a $500 million campaign goal set when it launched in 2014.
A portion of these funds will be used to finance a massive reconstruction of the Kennedy School’s main campus and to expand financial aid offerings to its students. Elmendorf said he hopes the increased financial liberty will enable its graduates to pursue their service-oriented goals in a wider, even if less traditional, range of capacities.
“Our donations come from people who want to solve public problems,” Elmendorf said. “They want a better functioning democracy or they want a media that informs citizens better or they want to see more economic opportunity in this country or others.”
Administrators say that these individuals—many of them with no former ties to the Kennedy School—are motivated to donate because of their connection with the Kennedy School’s mission.
“Sometimes the connection for some of these donors comes from a common set of values and a common commitment to public service and solving public problems, rather than the direct personal experience of having gone to the Kennedy School,”  Fung said.
Elmendorf said he sees the Kennedy School’s initiatives as aligning with its broader attempt to prepare their students for service, instead of responding to immediate political events.
In that spirit, he said the Kennedy School will reform its curriculum using capital campaign resources to modernize, and invest more heavily in digital technology.
This year, administrators established a Social Innovation Studio, designed to help students take entrepreneurial steps towards solving global problems.
“Social innovation is another area of growing interest in part because people are frustrated with the slow pace of governance and in part because non profit organization can work with governments in ways that are more effective than they could do alone,” Elmendorf said.
Ferreira described the studio as a “hub for social innovation in the government” with more of a focus on public good than other innovation hubs around. Project-based classes using the lab’s resources have also been created, such as MLD-837: Social Entrepreneurship and Innovation Lab for US & Global Health, a course that studies “U.S. and international social change initiatives.”
Elmendorf said HKS is also building a curriculum and faculty in the area of digital technology in governance, recognizing its growing relevance in government issues.
“Digital technology is a tool to administer public services and benefits more effectively. And it’s not a tool that we have taught enough about,” Elmendorf said.
He added that the new infrastructure stems from a deeper desire to adapt with the world, but maintain a decades-long commitment to public service education.
“The Kennedy School needs to keep changing because the world is changing and we need to keep pace and in some ways get ahead of the world,” Elmendorf said. “The core values of the school are not changing, the mission of the school is not changing.”

In May 2016, ending months of speculation and meetings behind closed doors, the College announced an unprecedented policy penalizing members of single-gender social groups. The policy—Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana’s first major public proposal to regulate Harvard’s off-campus social groups—seemed to present a clear choice for Harvard’s final clubs and Greek organizations: go gender neutral, or have members face penalties.
One year later, however, with the sanctions set to take effect for the freshman class arriving on campus in August, only four of the 23 traditionally single-gender groups implicated by the policy have adopted gender neutral membership.
The process for each of these four clubs—the Seneca, Oak, Sab, and AEPi—and the Spee, which added women to their membership before the announcement of the sanctions, has varied significantly. While the Sab has actively pursued gender neutrality, other clubs, like the Seneca, have remained de facto single-gender. At another club, the all-male Fox, initial efforts to go gender neutral have stalled.
Most fraternities, sororities, and final clubs, however, have continued to hold out, even as the policy—which will bar members of such groups from leadership positions and coveted fellowships—is set to take effect for this fall’s incoming class of freshmen.
As a newly formed committee tasked with re-assessing the sanctions deliberates the future of the policy, the four gender neutral organizations, the 19 that have resisted change, and even some administrators are realizing that the fundamental shifts the sanctions hoped to effect will not come immediately.
“There’s just a lot of confusion about what’s actually happening,” Shub Chhokra ’18 said. “I think [students are] unsure about whether this policy will be implemented, or will there be changes in the policy.”
Chhokra is a member of the committee tasked with reviewing, and potentially replacing, the policy. That committee represents the latest installment in a multi-year saga defined by private conversations between administrators and club leaders, a contentious policy announcement followed by a highly-publicized backlash, faculty legislation targeting the sanctions, and an entirely separate committee tasked with hashing out the details of the original policy announcement.
All the while, most clubs have adopted a wait-and-see approach. Those that have taken action and changed membership policies, however, have had to contend with an administration they say cannot always offer them definitive answers.
When the previously all-female Sab Club elected to go gender neutral last semester, for instance, club leaders reiterated previously-expressed frustration with the administration.
“There’s been so much ambiguity and there continues to be so much ambiguity,” Eugenia B. Schraa ’04, a former Crimson editor and Sab Club graduate board member, said of the College’s administrators at the time. “In the end we went with what the undergrads feel deeply about their identity and that made it a bit easier than thinking about what the administration is really going to do.”
The Seneca organization, meanwhile, met with administrators several times before adopting gender neutral by-laws in August 2016—a shift from its charter calling for an all-female membership.
But in emails obtained by The Crimson, the Seneca told its members that Associate Dean of Students David R. Friedrich had assured the group in a May 2016 meeting that removing gender requirements from its charter and bylaws would allow the club to “continue to operate as it always has.”
“Like Women in Business or Latinas Unidas, although men may apply, our membership can be made up wholly of women without incurring the sanctions of the administration's new policy,” then-co-presidents of the Seneca Avni Nahar ’17 and Fran F. Swanson ’17 wrote at the time.
Current co-presidents of the Seneca  Gita C. Abhiraman ’18 and Emma S. Schwartz ’18 added in an emailed statement to The Crimson that though the club’s current membership currently remains all-female, the club welcomes a “diverse group of applicants” to apply in the fall—including men.
According to Friedrich, the Seneca’s 501(c)(3) status distinguished it from clubs whose focus is solely social. The club’s mission, according to Abhiraman and Schwartz, is “to create opportunities, resources, and sustainable networks for women in social, educational, and professional environments.”
The publication of a committee report on implementing the College’s policy introduced further administrative designations for social groups, some of which students have called nebulous and vague.
The committee recommended that social groups seeking College recognition apply for designation as a “provisional student organization,” and be subject to a number of other requirements, including the publication of demographic data and reduction of financial barriers to participate. The committee also proposed a three to five year “bridge” program for female final clubs and sororities, allowing them to retain a “gender focused mission” while complying with the College’s policy.
Lulu S. Chua-Rubenfeld ’18, the Sab Club’s undergraduate president, said the the Sab—formerly called the Sablière Society—has not yet met with administrators about PSO or “bridge” status.
“Things are sort of still in limbo, and there hasn’t been a really defined road to becoming what the College wants us to be,” Chua-Rubenfeld said. “I don’t even know if they’re just happy with how we are now, but I would be open to reaching out to someone—I’m just not really sure what the process would be.”
AEPi President Jake H. Ascher ’19, meanwhile, said that he met with both Friedrich and Khurana about the provisional status.
“We would like to see our organization become a fully recognized organization on campus in the future,” Ascher said. “And we’re looking forward to getting the privileges that are associated with being a recognized organization.”
Though the Sab’s vote to go gender neutral passed with a two-thirds majority, some questions still remained for the group.
“I think you can have these fears going in—like how can this club that’s been only women for 15 years function if you just throw men into the mix?” Chua-Rubenfeld said.
The two previous final clubs that had moved away from single-gender membership offered distinct approaches.
The Spee, which became the first final club to adopt gender neutral membership in November 2015, had their female members undergo the same recruitment process as their male counterparts. The club did not dramatically change the punch—a club-specific term for a semester-long member selection process— to accommodate women, according to three people who went through the process.
The Fox, whose undergraduate membership attempted to add women to the club the same semester, chose to forego punch entirely for their new female members. Instead, they elected a select group of women directly in a process meant to “focus on the tradition and values of the Fox, while eliminating any activities with the potential to be ill-received by the female initiates,” according to a letter undergraduates sent to graduate members explaining their move.
Though the Fox graduate board eventually overturned the undergraduates’ decision, rendering the women’s membership “provisional,” the Sab’s approach resembled the Fox’s more than the Spee’s. This semester, the Sab elected 14 men into its ranks in anticipation of a gender neutral punch in the fall.
According to Chua-Rubenfeld, Sab leadership has prioritized adapting the club’s traditions to its new gender neutral membership.
“I think some of the traditions in punch will probably fall by the wayside,” she said. “We’re just trying to do more activities that would cater to a gender neutral environment and not just a specifically female environment.”
To aid in the transition, the club added men to its undergraduate board in interim elections this semester, appointing a male punchmaster and commencement chair to serve alongside female counterparts.
“We wanted men on board as soon as possible, because board is the gear behind the club, and we run the club and we make the decisions that will dictate punch and the future of the organization,” Chua-Rubenfeld said.
Samuel E. Beren ’19, the club’s new punchmaster, a member in charge of recruitment, said the Sab’s decision to elect men to the club’s leadership came in part from the example set by the Spee, which had recently elected a female vice-president.
“We definitely used [the Spee] as a good example,” Beren said. “Just talking to members of… the other co-ed clubs to get a sense of things they’ve done that have helped their transitions run smoothly.”
Several members of the Sab said the club’s efforts resulted in a smooth transition process.
“I think all the girls have done a really good job in making us feel welcome and not making us feel kind of like their ‘group of guys’ in a large group of girls,” Deven Hurt ’18, one of the Sab’s new male members, said.
Tynan Jackson ’19, a male Sab member, said he has recognized a “heightened consciousness of inclusivity” at the club.
Still, Hurt said that the Sab has strived to retain its identity as an organization of female empowerment while allowing people who are not female into its ranks.
“I think they did their best to retain the identity of what the Sab originally was, as kind of an artistic organization, as a feminist organization, but not necessarily as a feminine organization,” Hurt said.
In January, the all-male Oak Club also adopted gender neutral membership practices during its spring recruitment process after “a referendum in which a club-wide consensus was reached.”
The group conducted its first full-scale gender neutral recruitment process this spring, becoming the second all-male social club to go gender neutral during Khurana’s tenure. Oak president Jeremy D. Welborn ’18 did not respond to requests for comment on this story.
Similarly, members of the Harvard chapter of Alpha Epsilon Pi announced that the group would disaffiliate from its national umbrella organization and hold a gender neutral rush this fall.
Greek organizations are bound by the policies of national organizations, almost all of which mandate single-gender membership. For AEPi, complying with the policy was incompatible with remaining affiliated with their national fraternity.
Several undergraduate leaders of Harvard’s other fraternities did not respond to requests for comment.
Ascher, the AEPi president cited the policy as a major catalyst for making the change.
“We wanted to make a decision before the sanctions went into effect because we knew that it would be detrimental to our ability to recruit new people,” Ascher said.
According to Ascher, the group is not planning on any major changes to their rush process this fall.
“I don’t think that much has to change, to be honest,” he said. “I think there’s just little things here and there with regard to the rush process, our pledge process, that we’re looking out for, thinking about, and definitely changing.”
The first class of freshmen to be affected by the sanctions will arrive this August to a campus with a social club scene in flux—comprised of a patchwork of single-gender and some gender neutral organizations.
Though more clubs than ever before went gender neutral this past semester, there’s no guarantee more will follow. Since August, undergraduate support among members of the Fox Club fell from 83 percent in favor of gender neutral membership to less than 50 percent in a non-binding vote in early May.
Many of the remaining single-gender clubs—most notably the Porcellian and the Fly—have vociferously opposed the College’s attempts to influence their membership policies. The Fly publicly announced in September 2016 that it had retained legal counsel.
According to Jackson, groups that became co-ed saw a change in their relationship with clubs that remain single-gender.
“There is sort of this weird dynamic between clubs, specifically male clubs that are not co-ed yet, and interacting with them in those spaces.” Jackson said. “In terms of the male members, it's still kind of like this weird vibe. In terms of, like, ‘How do we, as the male club, interact with the co-ed club?’ We’re still kind of on this confused ground.”
While some groups have communicated with each other to share lessons learned and strategies for navigating the changes to Harvard’s social landscape, each is charting its own course.
“I think it’s a really tough situation... it’s not easy to make this change to go gender neutral,” Ascher said. “It’s a lot harder than people may think.”

On November 10, 2016, University President Drew G. Faust called a meeting. Two days before, Donald Trump, a reality television star and real estate mogul turned Republican presidential candidate, had won the nation’s highest office. At Harvard, alarm bells were going off.
Trump may not have run on an explicitly anti-Harvard platform, but over the course of the campaign, he had taken aim at a number of University priorities. He had promised to get rid of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals—an Obama-era policy protecting undocumented youth—ban Muslims from the country, make sweeping changes to the tax code that could imperil Harvard’s finances, and dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency.
While Faust and Harvard administrators cannot take a partisan stance, Trump’s victory represented a major threat to the University’s mission.
So Faust huddled in Massachusetts Hall with the deans of Harvard’s 12 schools to begin to hash out a plan of action. Harvard had been preparing for the upcoming change in administration, but by many measures, Trump’s victory was unexpected.
Soon after, Faust said in an interview with The Crimson that she would be “ramping up” her advocacy efforts in Washington, D.C. Traveling to Washington was nothing new for Faust: Harvard maintains a staff of lobbyists in an office in D.C., and Faust regularly makes trips to the Capitol to meet with lawmakers. But a Trump presidency required more.
In the following months, Faust would travel to Washington three times—two additional trips than in a typical year—to meet with at least 11 lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. Faust wrote an op-ed defending humanities funding in the New York Times and spoke on media roundtables, and Harvard filed two amicus briefs challenging Trump’s executive orders.
“There were certain assumptions that the federal government and universities together would be the bedrock of discovery in the United States,” Faust said in an interview in May. “And then you see an assault on that that says everything you assumed can no longer be assumed.”
“So it’s important now to articulate things we didn’t think we had to say,” she added.
The partnership between universities and the federal government traces back to World War II, when Harvard played a pivotal role in forging what became a driving force behind American innovation.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who graduated from the College in 1903, commissioned Vannevar Bush to write a report about peacetime scientific research efforts. Bush proposed that the federal government provide funding to universities in order to “insure our health, prosperity, and security as a nation in the modern world.”
Bush’s special deputy at the time was then-University President James Bryant Conant, class of 1913, a man who personified the budding collaboration between universities and the federal government. While president of Harvard, Conant chaired the National Defense Research Committee, advised President Harry Truman to drop the atomic bomb on Japan, opened up Harvard’s Dumbarton Oaks property to international leaders drafting the United Nations Charter, and participated in post-war talks on international control of nuclear weapons.
Under Nathan M. Pusey ’28, who succeeded Conant as president, Harvard came to further rely on the federal government to fund its research.
“The university no longer expects to avoid involvement in public affairs, for it is by now all too clear that free institutions and free political institutions are interdependent and their futures intertwined,” a 1961 pamphlet titled “Harvard and the Federal Government” reads.
By the time Derek C. Bok stepped down from the University presidency in 1991, long-time Harvard lobbyist Nan Nixon had moved to Washington and opened the precursor to today’s Federal Relations Office. Located in a suite at 499 South Capitol Street, the office is less than a mile from the Capitol. While small, it serves as the hub of Harvard’s lobbying activity—its eyes and ears on the front lines.
The office has seen four presidential transitions since its opening. During these oftentimes intense periods of change, lobbyists must get to know a new set of faces and often watch warily as newcomers to Washington get their bearings.
“One of the things that happens anytime you have a new administration—the first six months are particularly chaotic, because you’ve got new guys in town, and there’s normal stuff that’s happening, there’s stupid stuff that’s happening, and there’s some potentially dangerous stuff happening,” said Terry W. Hartle, senior vice president of the American Council on Education’s Division of Government and Public Affairs.
He described the atmosphere in January and February as “a time of rumors and uncertainties.”
It’s up to Director of Federal Relations Suzanne Day to guide Harvard through these uncertainties. Sporting a FitBit on her wrist, Day is a woman on the go: her job requires trekking to Cambridge at least once a month, attending regular meetings with higher education associations, and keeping tabs on proceedings at the Capitol.
Day worked as a congressional staffer for about 14 years—the last ten in Connecticut Senator Chris Dodd’s office, where she specialized in education policy and worked with colleagues across the aisle on reauthorizing the Higher Education Act twice. Day, a self-described “student aid geek” armed with extensive knowledge of legislative procedure, joined Harvard’s lobbying team in 2000.
Jon Groteboer and Peter DeYoe round out Harvard’s D.C. team. Groteboer, the University’s other registered lobbyist, focuses on research and budget appropriations, while DeYoe works as a legislative assistant.
“There’s just three of us and we’re very much like a team,” Day said. “We overlap each other’s issues a lot, we bounce ideas off each other.”
Vice President of Public Affairs and Communications Paul Andrew oversees the office from Massachusetts Hall. Kevin Casey, a former Harvard lobbyist and now a Harvard Public Affairs and Communications associate vice president, provides guidance to the D.C. team as well.
Harvard also consults with lawyers from O’Neill, Athy, and Casey—a boutique firm focused on lobbying—although Casey said the outside lawyers mainly serve as a “sounding board” and do not represent Harvard in any official capacity. The $550,000 Harvard spent on lobbying last year primarily went to paying this firm and the salaries of the Federal Relations Office staff.
Day keeps a “running list of people” she wants to catch up with on her frequent trips to campus, depending on the issue of the hour: the Financial Aid Office if it’s student aid, the Office of the General Counsel and the Harvard International Office if it’s immigration, or faculty if it’s research funding.
During the lead up to Trump’s inauguration, Harvard’s D.C. office was abuzz, preparing for what seemed to be a seismic shift in the way the federal government approached higher education. Their concerns seemed to be well-founded after Trump issued two executive orders barring immigrants from several predominantly Muslim countries and a “devastating” 2018 budget blueprint that slashed research funding.
“We realized that this would be a time where it would be important to have a presence there to be making the case for the University, so it would be a time of heightened activity,” Andrew said.
Knowledge of trends in Washington and the ability to see through political grandstanding helps Harvard’s lobbyists discern and prioritize the issues that will likely have a tangible effect on the University.
“I think what we try to bring to it is also a sense of what’s realistic to be worried about,” Day said. “You can be worried about everything, but we try to calibrate what we think is actually in the realm of possibility on the Hill and then engage to make a difference.”
Once the team has made an issue a priority, Day said they strategize about when to meet with congressional staffers, watch hearings online or from the Capitol galleries, and arrange joint meetings with colleagues and lawmakers.
“A lot of it is about kind of taking the pulse, and knowing what’s going on,” Day said.
In his Harvard lab, applied sciences and biomedical engineering professor Kit Parker develops technologies to help alleviate brain trauma. He relies on money from the federal government to fund his work.
When Faust invited Susan Collins, a Republican Senator from Maine who sits on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions committee to campus, Faust knew she had an opportunity. The D.C. office was aware that Collins was interested in Alzheimer’s research, and Day proposed that she pay a visit to Parker.
Faust said the tour of Parker’s lab was a success.
“She said this very explicitly to me, she went away with a lot of stories she could tell to colleagues she’s trying to convince to support science,” Faust said. “Storytelling is such a powerful weapon for persuasion. So having people actually being able to say ‘When I was in this lab at Harvard I could see the organ-on-a-chip beating away and I knew that had been discovered and that it would be improved.’”
“That can be very vivid,” she added.
At an Institute of Politics event after her lab tour, Collins told audience members, "If our leaders would work together and commit to a multi-year increase for NIH funding, and propose ways to expedite new treatments and drugs through the FDA, that would make a real difference.”
The D.C. office acts “almost [as] a concierge service,” Casey said, pairing lawmakers with faculty whose research fits their interests. While federal relations officers usher lawmakers through labs to showcase Harvard’s most promising projects, the visits also give professors themselves the chance to advocate for their work.
“My research group is about one step away from going out and knocking off liquor stores to pay for this kind of science,” Parker said. “And between NIH and the Department of Defense, it’s been an absolute disgrace. And I lay that down on Senator Collins and every one of these people that comes through here.”
Harvard received around $600 million in research funding from the federal government in 2016—the single largest source of research funding at the University. Congress appropriates money to agencies such as the National Institutes of Health, National Endowments for Arts and Humanities, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Department of Defense.
With Trump in office, federal research funding faces a less than certain future.
“Harvard is one of maybe 25 schools in the country that gets more research funding than student aid funding,” Hartle said. “So Harvard in particular has a very big concern with federal funding.”
But communicating that concerns requires careful consideration. Because Harvard is a 501(c)3, tax-exempt organization, the law forbids the University from taking explicitly partisan stances.
“As a general philosophy that the University has, we express views very clearly on things that bear on our core educational mission,” Harvard General Counsel Robert W. Iuliano said. “We can’t hang from Massachusetts Hall a political banner saying we support this candidate or that candidate—that would raise tax-exemption issues.”
Instead, the federal relations team works to craft a message that emphasizes the nonpartisan importance of the work researchers and students at Harvard do. Beyond setting up meetings with legislators, they send articles from the Harvard Gazette—a publication run by HPAC—that highlight examples of faculty and student achievement.
When members of Congress started to call the tax-exempt status of Harvard’s $35.6 billion endowment into question, Faust sent them a detailed memo, making the case for preserving that status. The Gazette covered this as well.
With immigration policy, Harvard has waded into increasingly politically charged waters as it advocates for broader protections for undocumented students.
When immigration authorities detained undocumented student Eric Balderas ’13 at an airport in 2010, Faust called Senator Richard J. Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois. Faust had publicly supported the DREAM Act, a piece of legislation Durbin co-sponsored that, if passed, would provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented youth.
Durbin helped Balderas get permission to remain in the United States and testified about Balderas’ case on the Senate floor, according to a Durbin aide. Faust and Balderas later visited Durbin in his office in the Capitol to thank the Senator in person.
Anxieties among undocumented students heightened after Trump’s election, and Faust pledged to continue advocating for the Bridge Act—a newer, bipartisan piece of legislation Durbin and South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham introduced in January.
“I know where her heart is on this, and I really appreciate her leadership in bringing together other university and college presidents and signing a letter in support of the DACA program and the Bridge Act,” Durbin said in an interview, calling Faust a “national leader.”
Hearing firsthand accounts from university representatives of students impacted by federal policy helps inform Durbin’s legislative efforts.
“We spend a lot of time in Washington working on education, talking about the opportunity it creates; they bring the issue home—they explain what their students are facing, and talk about the policy needs,” he said.
More recently, when Trump’s travel bans stranded several Harvard affiliates abroad and stoked fears among those on campus, Harvard took its message to the courts, filing amicus briefs in two cases challenging the order.
“While the Executive Order is currently limited to seven countries, its damaging effects have already been widely felt by American universities,” the second brief reads.
On a rainy April afternoon, Faust steps out of a black Cadillac Escalade and into the Dirksen Senate Office Building for an appointment. Earlier that morning, she had made the case for government support of higher education at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C., and now she was headed to meet with lawmakers to make that same argument.
Faust typically travels to the nation’s capital in April to attend the AAU’s semi-annual meeting of university presidents. But this spring, she made two additional trips—one in January and one in February.
Faust is perhaps Harvard’s most compelling champion. Though her background is in the academy and not politics, members of the lobbying office carefully consider how to best leverage Faust’s status and harness her persuasive abilities.
“I think that we’re also always thinking, what is the right moment of impact? What is the right time and opportunity to deliver, to make our case in the right areas?” Andrew said.
The D.C. office works with Andrew on scheduling Faust’s itinerary, strategically timing both who she meets with and when.
“We have been busier, really busy,” Day said. “With President Faust here a lot this year, we’ve been much more focused on sort of organizing her time.”
Day said the office is well acquainted with the “built-in rhythm” of appropriations season: the President typically submits a federal budget request to Congress by February, she said, and the budget passes by Oct. 1. But in recent years, Congress has struggled to reach spending agreements on time.
“That was why it was important for President Faust to be in Washington early in the year, understanding that the FY17 budget was still in play and she wanted to make a forceful case for the partnership and for research funding,” Andrew said.
Andrew said there are four categories of lawmakers that the University actively engages: alumni, members of key House and Senate committees, congressional leaders, and the Massachusetts delegation. Representative Niki Tsongas, a Democrat from Massachusetts, wrote in an emailed statement that she has met with Faust on a number of occasions..
A congressional aide to Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts said Faust and Markey have been “longtime friends and meet very often.”
Day said Faust writes congratulatory notes to Harvard alumni elected to Congress, and added that the D.C. office tracks nominees who are alumni as well.
Representative Ronald J. Kind ’85, a Democrat from Wisconsin who remembers cleaning Harvard toilets for Dorm Crew, met Faust on one of her trips to the Hill. He said she seems to have a “wider jurisdiction” than most university presidents given Harvard’s strong alumni base in Washington.
“She does have a nice little Harvard alum community here in Congress,” Kind said. “I’ve noticed when she does come she tries to touch base with Harvard grads, both undergraduate and graduate grads, who are serving in Congress or in the administration, and I’m always happy to sit down and meet with her when she does come.”
On her most recent trip to Washington, Faust met with Representative Scott Taylor—an alumnus of the Extension School—Senator Al Franken ’73, and Senator Maggie Hassan, who Faust called a “faculty brat” since her father was a Harvard professor.

Taylor, a newly elected Republican member of the House from Virginia, is a member of the House Appropriations committee.
“If he could have any influence in advancing that case in appropriations, it would be extremely valuable,” Faust said. “So I want to make sure he understands what matters to us, and what matters in terms of national policy to universities more generally.”
Faust often takes this macro-approach, thinking of the current climate with regard to higher education as opposed to just her own institution.
Harvard is a member of both the American Council on Education and the Association for American Universities. The ACE has functioned as an umbrella association for colleges and universities around the country since 1918, and the AAU is a more selective subset of research universities. Harvard’s federal relations team attends each association’s monthly meetings, and Faust travels to Washington each year when the AAU convenes the presidents of its member schools.
Universities compete constantly for students and faculty, but in their political advocacy, it pays to stand united, particularly during a turbulent time.
“The only tool we have is the ability to speak with a unified voice,” Hartle said. “Colleges and universities do not have PACs, they don’t do fundraisers, they don’t do issue advertising, and they’re not particularly good at getting votes on Election Day. The only way we can influence policy is…speaking with one voice.”
Harvard’s lobbyists are prominent in the higher education advocacy orbit. Hartle has known Day for almost 30 years, since the two worked together on the Hill. Day also often works with lobbyists at peer institutions, like Joyce A. Rechtschaffen, Princeton’s director of government relations.
“Suzanne is one of the people if I want a second opinion on something, if I just want to run something by, she’s one of those I turn to,” Rechtschaffen said.
Rechtschaffen said Faust’s efforts benefit schools across the country.
“President Faust is a great spokesman for higher education in Washington,” Rechtschaffen said. “She uses the Harvard brand in a wonderful way for all of us, all of higher education.”
That brand carries political weight in Washington, Kind said, adding that Faust is “very well-respected” in Washington.
“I respect the institution very much, and have been willing to work with the leadership at Harvard, even though I didn’t attend the university. So I think the reputation of the school has an impact on their ability to lobby,” Durbin said.

The future of Harvard’s political advocacy seemed bleak at times in recent months, but Faust remains optimistic.
For one, the fiscal year 2017 spending bill, passed in May, increased NIH’s funding by $2 billion and appropriated $2 million more for the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. While Trump has yet to release the full version of his 2018 budget proposal, Faust said the 2017 spending bill “bodes well” for research funding.
Now, Hartle said associations and university lobbyists across the country are gearing up for a budget fight marked by “political brinksmanship” this fall, when Congress will finalize the budget for fiscal year 2018.
“We’ll see the president’s budget come out on May 22 or May 23, and we’ll have to marshall our arguments and our best stories,” Casey said.
On the immigration front, Durbin said it is fortunate that Trump has not eliminated DACA, but the status of the Bridge Act is still uncertain.
The Higher Education Opportunity Act, which authorizes programs like Pell grants, student financial aid, and work study, is also up for reauthorization this congressional cycle. Day said it will be a major area of focus in the months ahead.
Lawmakers have not stripped the tax-exempt status from large university endowments—at least for now.
Still, if one thing is certain about the current political climate, it is that nothing is certain.
“You have to be careful in Washington to never predict,” Day said with a laugh. “I mean we’ve all learned that, right?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some students accused of cheating in Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I” consulted lawyers during the disciplinary process last semester, though Harvard is unlikely to face any lawsuits, according to several attorneys familiar with the matter.
More than 60 fall 2016 enrollees in CS50 appeared before the Honor Council—the body that adjudicates academic dishonesty cases at the College—in a wave of cheating that stretched the Council to its limits, The Crimson reported in early May. The spate of cases represents roughly ten percent of the 636 total students who took Harvard’s flagship introductory computer science course last fall.
Michael R. Schneider, a Boston-based lawyer who often acts as a consultant for Harvard students facing accusations of academic dishonesty, said he worked with CS50 enrollees under investigation last semester. He declined to give an exact number.
Several other Boston-area lawyers—including attorneys for Zalkind Duncan & Bernstein LLP, a local firm that specializes in students’ rights and has represented Harvard affiliates in the past—declined to say whether or not they had counseled CS50 enrollees.
The Honor Council permits students to hire legal help to guide them through the body’s disciplinary proceedings. In a pamphlet sent to students accused of academic dishonesty, the Honor Council informs undergraduates they may discuss details of their case—including the written statement students present to the Council—with “legal counsel.”
The document goes on to define lawyers as falling within the category of “those who have a need to know,” along with clergy and students’ family members. “There are no restrictions on what you may share with this group of people, but they may not share with others the information you learn,” reads the pamphlet, obtained by The Crimson.
Robert L. Peabody ’77, a lawyer who said he represented students in a 2012 Harvard cheating scandal in a government class, said Harvard is unlikely to face lawsuits from students accused of cheating in CS50 because the cases are “awfully hard” to prosecute. He said there is little basis to sue the University unless undergraduates can prove there is a “systemic problem” in the way Harvard adjudicates academic dishonesty cases.
Peabody and another lawyer with experience advising students accused of academic dishonesty said the job mainly involves helping students get their paperwork in order. Peabody recalled compiling documents and helping students craft statements they read in front of the College’s disciplinary body during the 2012 cheating scandal. Peabody said he did not counsel any CS50 enrollees.
Devon D. Hincapie, who graduated from the Law School in 1998, said the Boston-area firm she works for—Swomley and Associates—often aids Harvard undergraduates and graduate students involved in academic dishonesty cases, though she declined to say whether she advised any CS50 students. She said lawyers counseling students accused of academic dishonesty work to ensure schools don’t trespass on these students’ rights.
“What a person calling an attorney for is for letter writing and making sure that his rights are respected, [because] if the University suspects there is some wrongdoing they need to follow their procedures,” Hincapie said. “What an attorney is going to be looking for is have they followed these procedures.”
Reflecting on the recent spate of cheating in CS50, Peabody lamented the fact that he moved from Massachusetts to work in New York City a few years ago. He said he thinks this is why no CS50 enrollees called him to ask for legal help, and added that academic dishonesty cases are “great fun to do.”
“They’re really exciting, I enjoy kids, I have two college-aged kids [so] I’m always interested in helping young people sort out their mistakes,” he said. “I’d love to get a client in that.”
“My sense when I read the article was that I was late to the party,” Peabody added, referring to The Crimson’s original report on the CS50 cheating cases.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sally Q. Yates, the former United States acting attorney general, encouraged Law School students to fight the instinct to follow a “risk-free course” at the school’s Class Day Wednesday.
Yates made national headlines in January when President Donald Trump fired her only ten days into his presidency after she refused to defend an executive order barring immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries.
“I believed then and I believe now that resigning would have protected my personal integrity, but it would not have protected the integrity of the Department of Justice,” Yates remarked about her brief tenure as acting attorney general. “The Department of Justice is not just another law firm and this wasn’t just any legal issue. It was about a core founding principle of religious freedom.”
Addressing soon-to-be graduates outside the Law School’s library, Langdell Hall, Yates used four main lessons she said she has learned during her 31 years as a lawyer to frame the speech.
Earning undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Georgia, Yates was appointed deputy attorney general—the Justice Department’s second-highest ranking official—in 2015 under former President Barack Obama and became the country’s chief law enforcement officer upon Trump’s inauguration.
“You never know when a situation will present itself and you’re going to have to decide who you are and what you stand for,” Yates said describing her experiencing confronting Trump’s travel ban. “The defining moments in our lives often don’t come with advance warning.”
Concluding her remarks, Yates entreated the law students to “decide what you believe is worth fighting for.”
“I hope the fear of being wrong won’t keep you from acting,” she continued. “To fully embrace both life and practicing law, you have got to be willing to take a risk, to be uncomfortable, to be bold.”
The Law School’s Class Day ceremony marked the beginning of their bicentennial celebration as the school continues to reexamine long-held practices around issues including admissions, an evolving curriculum, and campus culture. The occasion also featured one of the final addresses by outgoing Dean of the Law School Martha L. Minow, who will step down in July to return to teaching full-time.
Yates shared the stage with speakers including Peter C. Krause, president of the Harvard Law School Association, Dean of Students Marcia L. Sells, and professor Mark Wu ’96, who received a teaching award.
The Law School’s Class of 2017 is the first time in the history of the oldest continuously operating law school in the United States that men and women were equally represented in the graduating class, according to Class Marshal Rebecca M. Murday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Speaking in a political climate in which he said “there is nothing normal,” former Secretary of State John Kerry implored hundreds of students set to graduate from the Kennedy School to focus on the long-term purpose of government “completely absent in today’s politics.”
Kerry urged the school’s Class of 2017 to pursue activism in a “moment of adversity.”
“I did not come here to be partisan or political or pessimistic,” Kerry said in his speech at the school’s graduation ceremony. “But I need to tell you the truth, and together we all need to start acting on it.”
“The worst thing I can do is insult your intelligence by pretending that it’s just smooth sailing for America and for the world,” Kerry continued. “And I refuse to self-consciously twist myself into a pretzel and put on a contrived mantle of bipartisanship that alleges that both parties are to blame for what’s going on, or what’s not going on.”
From 2013 to 2017, Kerry served as Secretary of State under former President Barack Obama after running as the the Democratic nominee for president in 2004. He graduated from Yale University in 1966.
Previous Kennedy School commencement speakers include former Secretary of State Madeleine J.K. Albright and Samantha Power, who served as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations under Obama.
The Kennedy School aims to actively advance the public good, and originally educated students for careers in government and civil service. Today, however, many of its graduates matriculate to private sector jobs.
In a nearly hour-long speech punctuated at times by applause, Kerry did not mince words with his thoughts on the Trump administration.
At several points, Kerry referenced political controversies that have engulfed the White House in recent months, including President Donald Trump’s dismissal of former FBI Director James Comey amid an ongoing investigation into potential ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.
Still, Kerry said he was optimistic about the future—one he said he hoped that would be much different from the present.
“We have to focus on the special purpose,” Kerry said. “A focus deprived of all oxygen by the daily forest fires that we are forced to fight. Because while we’re stuck disproving the crazy proposition that two plus two equals five, while we’re fighting just to hold on to truths long ago decided, far more is at stake, and we aren’t even scratching the surface.”
In issues ranging from unemployment to climate change to terrorism, Kerry said that a solution could be found in diplomacy and cooperation.
“To succeed in an already globalized world, my friends, and a super-connected world, all of us have to opt in,” he said. “Every one of us has to win.”
Kerry added, however, that he didn’t “just want to put out a big idea,” but rather share how “we can actually do it.” Among other things, he voiced support for partnering with other nations to increase global development through the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and China’s Belt and Road Initiative.
“The reason I know we can do this is because even against resistance, again and again, we have seen what activism can do when young people put their minds to it,” Kerry said.
Finishing with the words of Harvard alumus T.S. Eliot Class of 1910, he challenged graduates to not “wind up fretfully musing as Prufrock did, ‘Do I dare disturb the universe?’”
“Class of 2017,” Kerry said. “Your job is to disturb the universe.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. exhorted graduating College seniors not to abandon politics and public service in the wake of the 2016 presidential election at the College’s Class Day celebration Wednesday.
Applause and a standing ovation greeted Biden as he took the podium in Tercentenary Theatre Wednesday afternoon. Biden began with quips aimed at the students who spoke before him, before joking about staples of Harvard student life—Scorpion Bowls at Hong Kong Restaurant, the post-finals stench of Lamont Library, and the Harvard Meme Page—to the audience’s delight.
“Me and the Dean in one place—it’s time to break the internet,” Biden cracked, alluding to his and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana’s online stardom. He then paused to snap a selfie with Khurana.
Biden’s speech quickly turned political, however, as he evoked the 2016 presidential election.
“We saw how if you play on the fears, appeal to the baser instincts rather than our better angels, you can still reap some temporary and powerful political success,” he said in a reference to President Donald Trump. “I imagine for many of you, seeing this unfold was incredibly disorienting and disheartening.”
Biden drew parallels between the current moment and the time of his own college graduation in the 1960s. He recalled the turmoil and disillusionment surrounding the Vietnam War and the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., who was set to speak at the College’s first Class Day in 1968 before he was killed in April of that year.
Under such circumstances, Biden said, it is tempting to disengage from public life. He pointed to a recent Crimson survey of graduating seniors that revealed that 37 percent of the Class of 2017 who had considered taking a job in the federal government changed their minds after the election.
“Forgive me, but I think that’s the wrong reaction. You have an obligation to get engaged,” Biden said. “Don’t fool yourself into thinking that disengaging from the system that you think is broken will hold you harmless from the system’s failures. You can’t cut yourself off from the consequences of a failed political system, Goldman Sachs or not.”
His voice rising, Biden put forward an optimistic vision of a more daring America—a country that, with the new generation of college graduates at its helm, would lead the world.
“I’m so tired of both political parties talking about incrementalism. America has always thought big and boldly. What has happened to us?” he asked to resounding applause.
“In order to fulfill your destiny, Class of ’17, it’s absolutely essential for you to engage in the world around you,” Biden told graduating seniors. “You’re the most engaged, tolerant, talented generation in our history. But none of that will matter if you don’t get engaged in the public affairs of this nation.”
To Biden, engaging specifically means entering politics. Invoking Plato, Biden told forthcoming graduates, “‘The penalty good people pay for not being involved in politics is being governed by people worse than themselves.’ So you have to engage, you have to be involved even with this dirty business of politics. You have to, for your own safety’s sake. And I have no doubt you will, because you must.”
Student speeches, both humorous and somber, preceded Biden’s address. Harvard orators Jonathan S. Roberts ’17 and Bessie X. Zhang ’17 reminded classmates of the privilege inherent in a Harvard diploma and the Freshman Outdoor program and power of silence, respectively. As Ivy Orators, Declan P. Garvey ’17 jested about the failures of Harvard students and Rachel J. Stromberg ’17 poked fun at a number of aspects of Harvard life.
First and Second Class Marshals Riya N. Patel ’17 and Katherine F.G. Wu ’17 delivered opening and closing remarks, and Khurana and incoming Harvard Alumni Association president Susan Morris Novick ’85 also addressed the crowd. Blockmates of Haley Rue ’17, who died in 2014, read excerpts of her writing as a tribute to Rue. Student vocalists closed the event with the class of 2017’s ode, sung to the tune of “Fair Harvard.”
Facebook founder and Harvard dropout Mark E. Zuckerberg will speak at the 366th Commencement ceremony tomorrow afternoon.

Yardfest 2016. Students sprawled outside Widener Library. Afternoon sunlight slanting through trees. Young grass like peach fuzz. Everywhere the weight of nostalgia.
At one end of Tercentenary Theater, four Harvard football players struck up Lynyrd Skynyrd’s “Free Bird.” Molasses chords slid through the air: “If I leave here tomorrow / would you still remember me?”
Scott Peters (safety), Adam Redmond (offensive lineman), Luke Roberts (linebacker), and Cole Toner (offensive lineman) had all played their last college snaps. But they were playing together now—a final encore for the 2015 football team.
In one month, football seniors would graduate with a 36-4 record, tied for best in school history. Since 2013, Harvard won three straight Ivy titles.
In fact, since 2000, the program boasted a 123-26 record, best in FCS football. Coach Tim Murphy had won nine championships and prepped 25 players for professional contracts. That cohort included Toner and Redmond, who would sign with the Arizona Cardinals and Indianapolis Colts, respectively.
Of course it was sunny on Yardfest.
At least one trophy remained elusive—a championship four-peat. In the fall of 2016, powered by new seniors, the Crimson aimed to achieve that feat.
For three years, Harvard football had walked a tightrope of excellence. Peters, Redmond, Toner, and all other seniors basked in that accomplishment.
But the tightrope extended past the fall of 2015. Always, the next season beckoned. And always, the expectations grew heavier.
That weight burdened the 2016 team. Statistics will say that Harvard faced 10 opponents. In reality, the Crimson faced one—itself.
Few challenges would prove stiffer.

Trappings of grandeur surround Crimson football. Start with the institution. Harvard, the oldest college in the nation. Stained-glass dining halls. Turrets on the Charles.
Traditions do not guarantee trophies, though. Between 1988 and 1996, Harvard posted a 32-57-1 record and never topped .500 in a season.
Those numbers can seem outlandish now. Since 1998, the Crimson has not suffered a losing year.
Much of the credit belongs to a man who himself experienced a sudden transformation. In 1978, Tim Murphy was a part-time assistant at Brown, working a graveyard shift at a mill to meet expenses.
Eight years later, the former linebacker became the youngest head coach in college football when he joined Maine. And two years later, he became the youngest head coach in Division I when he joined Cincinnati.
All Harvard players know the concept of “Murphy Time.” Under these guidelines, an event that starts at 3 p.m. really starts at 2:55 p.m. So people should show up at 2:50.
Murphy Time applies not only to meetings but also to career paths. Most head coaches blossom in middle age; Murphy did so a decade earlier.
Certainly, the Kingston, Mass., native was anxious to get going when he grabbed the Harvard job. Arriving before the 1994 season, he surveyed a program that had gone 3-7 in each of the last two seasons and declared that the Crimson would win a title in the next four years.
That promise paid out on schedule, with Harvard going 9-1 in 1997. Cue the start of the Murphy era.
“One thing that Coach Murphy harps on a lot…is grit," senior safety Kolbi Brown said. “That brings all of it together—facing adversity [and] bouncing back.”
The coach brought idiosyncrasies besides timeliness. At Maine, the Black Bears had a regular fight song. At Harvard, Murphy discovered “Ten Thousand Men of Harvard.” Now the Crimson belts the lyrics after every victory.
Moreover, the title of the song adorns Harvard helmets. The words invoke bravado but also the thousands of men who have passed through Murphy’s program—passed through and left, in each case, with at least one championship.
“You’re not going to be perfect every day,” senior defensive lineman James Duberg said. “The best part is holding yourself to a higher standard that you know you can achieve.”

Since 1998, Harvard has enjoyed steady success, but the three seasons before 2016 brought especially intense moments.
In 2013, the team went 9-1, including a 34-7 trouncing of Yale.
In 2014, the team never lost. The campaign ended with Hollywood drama when Harvard bested Yale on a last-minute score.
In 2015, the Crimson extended the longest win streak in the FCS to 22 before losing to Penn. Still, Harvard topped the Bulldogs for a third-straight championship.
Success reflects unique practices. During the season, morning workouts start at 6:30 a.m. In winter, players cross Weeks Bridge despite darkness and caustic winds. Spring culminates in a team-wide scrimmage. And over the summer, scores of players take Boston internships and participate in optional workouts.
“It’s never easy waking up all spring at 5-something-a.m.,” Brown said. “That’s all part of the game…[but] it’s tough to do that for four years.”
Other tendencies matter, too—such as the decision to elect a single captain. Linebackers have accounted for five of the last seven selections. And the last 13 leaders have all played defense.
Prior to 2016, such traditions delivered steady results. If the first 19 years of the Murphy era—from 1994 through 2012—comprised a steady climb, then the next three years—from 2013 through 2015—comprised a peak.
In Sept. 2016, with Murphy at the helm for his 23rd season, Harvard took a new step, away from the summit and onto the ridgeline.

“Harvard Voted #IvyFootball Preseason Favorite for Sixth Time in Nine Years,” blared the Ivy League press release on Aug. 9, 2016.
The prediction came despite an unsettled Crimson roster. Fifteen starters. Nine first-team selections. Four NFL signees. All gone in the twist of a clock, and all needing replacements.
That plug-and-go narrative contrasted with Penn, which polled second. The star trio of Alek Torgersen (quarterback), Justin Watson (wide receiver), and Tre Solomon (running back) returned to lead the Quakers attack.
Fresh faces versus the veterans—already the playbill was set. Ironically, it was the fresh faces trying to preserve a history of success, while the veterans sought to forge a tradition of their own.
For Harvard, Anthony Firkser represented a bridge to the past. Currently, 13 Crimson graduates hold NFL contracts. Four played tight end in college.
In 2014 and 2015, Firkser backed up Ben Braunecker, now a member of the Chicago Bears, but still landed on the All-Ivy second team. Senior year offered a chance to break out.
In week three, facing Georgetown at home, Firkser tallied four catches, 134 yards, and two touchdowns—in the first half alone.
That performance helped Harvard secure a 31-17 victory and allay any fears about an early-season collapse. In each of the first three games (against Rhode Island, Brown, and Georgetown), the Crimson eclipsed 30 points and won by double-digits.
In October, then, Harvard launched into conference play with a spotless résumé—just as everyone had expected. A 29-13 triumph over Cornell did nothing to dispel the idea. Beneath the surface, though, intrigue boiled.
In the first four games, senior quarterback Joe Viviano had thrown seven scores without a turnover. But a hurt knee ruled him out for the Oct. 15 contest at Holy Cross. Injuries also sidelined sophomore wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley and junior rusher Semar Smith.
Harvard entered Worcester, Mass., with a depleted cast, and the Crimson did not fare well, falling 27-17.
Even with the asterisks, the loss came as a shock. Harvard had won its last 16 nonconference matchups. And, in a particular point of pride for Murphy, the Crimson had not dropped a road match since Nov. 2012.
With those streaks over, the subsequent matchup at Princeton loomed as a major test. Despite facing a 14-0 deficit, the Tigers clawed back to tie the contest at 17.
Against all momentum, Harvard held steady. In overtime, 2017 captain Luke Hutton broke up a third-down pass to force a field goal, and on the next possession, Viviano scrambled for a third-down conversion.
Two plays later, when the quarterback fell over the goal line, the Crimson could take a deep breath. A 5-1 overall record was not perfect, but a 3-0 league mark was all that mattered.
Week by week, the Harvard four-peat was coming together. But then it all fell apart.
For the Crimson, no rival means more than Yale, but Harvard reserves a special hatred for Penn. The Quakers are tied with Dartmouth for the most Ancient Eight titles (18). Crimson players still relay the legend of how Penn snuffed out championship cigars on the Harvard Stadium turf.
In 2015, the Quakers upset the Crimson, 35-25, to break a 22-game win streak. Nov. 11, 2016 offered a chance for revenge.
After one-score wins over Dartmouth and Columbia, Harvard arrived at Franklin Field with a perfect league record. But on a blustery night, the offense froze. Viviano threw three interceptions in the first half.
Late in the fourth quarter, the Crimson faced a 14-6 deficit. Harvard mounted a tying push, capped off by a 26-yard touchdown pass.

With three minutes to play, though, the Quaker offense revived. Penn marched down the field, and with 15 seconds left, wide receiver Justin Watson plunged the dagger—a slant touchdown.
“The aftermath was disappointment, immediately,” Duberg said. “[But] you can’t keep beating yourself up. That’s not going to help you.”
Crimson players would not get revenge. All they could hope for, in the best of worlds, was a split Ivy title. That result hinged on the last weekend—meaning the Harvard-Yale game. The historic four-peat was at stake.
Absent from the Penn game was cornerback Sean Ahern. An October shoulder injury had limited the captain. Each week, he suited up. And each week, he stood sentinel on the sidelines.
As a sophomore and junior, Ahern had made the All-Ivy first team. In 2016, he was back for a grand finale—if not for this injury.
“I could see the pained look on his face every single practice,” Duberg said. “Every single game, that pain had magnified 10 times over.”
A few days after the Penn game, Ahern reflected on what the Harvard-Yale game might mean. Biting his lip, he gazed across Harvard Stadium.
“It’s definitely tough not being out there with the guys,” the captain said. “That’s why I came back, to play 10 games…. [But] those three championships didn’t just happen. Now we have a chance to do four.”
Every year, The Game takes place on a Saturday. Which means that the Last Lap takes place on Thursday. Per tradition, seniors circle the field and shake hands with all teammates and coaches.
In 2016, the Last Lap took on added significance. Veterans were not only saying goodbye but also making a guarantee—that on Saturday, the Crimson would atone for the Penn loss with a championship celebration.
Confidently, non-players could also make this guarantee. Yale, then 2-7, had not topped Harvard since 2006.
In 2016, the Bulldogs leaned on youngsters, with predictable results. Before The Game, Yale ranked worst in the Ancient Eight in scoring defense, conceding 36 points per go. Moreover, the Bulldogs started freshman quarterback Kurt Rawlings, who had tallied a mere 623 yards through the air.
Before The Game, Harvard publication Satire V sold shirts that read, “Insanit-Y is playing the same team over and over again and expecting different results.” Suspense hardly lay in the outcome. If anything, suspense lay in the margin of Crimson victory.

The first quarter, however, settled into a stalemate. A chastened Viviano threw the ball exactly once.
The dam broke in the second quarter, when sophomore running back Charlie Booker escaped for a 27-yard score. Now for the blowout.
Except that, on Yale’s next possession, the visitors marched 68 yards to tie the game. After 30 minutes, as the two squads headed into their locker rooms, the score stood at 7-7.
Bulldogs coach Tony Reno was not satisfied with this state of affairs. No matter that Yale had surprised most analysts with this low-scoring tie—Reno was impatient for more.
For years, Reno had worked under Murphy, building the résumé necessary to earn a higher-profile job.
This tactic was quite normal. Nine of Murphy’s former assistants have progressed to head coaching jobs. John Harbaugh, the Baltimore Ravens coach, once managed special teams for a Murphy-led Cincinnati program.
What was unusual, though, was Reno’s choice of destination. After the 2011 season, he left for the Bulldogs. Immediately, he transformed from one of Murphy’s closest confidants to his most obvious rival.
Now, with the second half starting, Reno decided to pull a trick. On the opening kickoff, Yale junior Blake Horn dinked the ball 11 yards forward—just enough for the Bulldogs to swoop in for the recovery.
So much for hopes of an early Harvard score. After one minute, Yale had rumbled into the end zone for a 14-7 lead.
The reality of a tight contest set in at Harvard Stadium. The Crimson would have to come from behind.
Finally, the Harvard offense proved capable. With 8:19 left in the third, the Crimson punched in a score to lock the game at 14. A back-and-forth battle seemed likely.
Instead, the scoreboard remained stuck. Early in the fourth, Harvard advanced into the red zone but missed a 35-yard field goal.
The season changed with 11 minutes to play, when Rawlings took the field. Over the next 14 plays, Yale grinded away at the Crimson’s defense. The Bulldogs faced three third downs but converted each one.
The final test came on third-and-goal. Ignoring the jeers of the home crowd, Rawlings fired a bullet to fellow rookie Reed Klubnik. Bulldogs 21, Crimson 14.

Here came Viviano’s turn for heroics. In front of 30,000 fans, he could carve a place in Harvard lore.
The narrative never took hold. In two plays, the Crimson lost 10 yards. And on third down, Murphy dialed up a conservative screen pass. Harvard punted.
Suddenly, the onus lay on the defense, which mounted a stand. Four plays later, the Crimson offense returned to the field, now with 1:13 left but the same opportunity to prolong the season.
Eighty yards separated Harvard from the goal line. Eighty yards to storybook success or anonymous letdown. One way or another, the seconds continued to tick.
The critical play came on fourth-and-11 from the Harvard 47. Viviano lobbed a prayer in the direction of Firkser and Yale’s Jason Alessi. Everything collided and dropped. The ball slapped the turf.
In that moment, as half the crowd erupted in jubilation, Penn and Princeton became Ivy League co-champions. And the 2016 Crimson confronted a strange fact—the certainty of hurt, not just for a minute but for the rest of time.
“[I remember] walking backwards, looking up at Harvard Stadium with my teammates,” Duberg said. “Even though it was a loss, I never want to forget that feeling.”

In 2017, Harvard will return for a revenge tour.
In order to achieve this goal, the Crimson will rely on familiar tactics—linebacker captains (in this case Hutton), early-morning practices, and the like. Murphy remains, as do all his Murphy-isms.
The crucial variable, however, is something that outsiders cannot assess—the months of quiet preparation.
“I tortured myself with the film the week after, watching it probably daily,” Duberg said. “If I had another season at Harvard, I would be very, very sure to prepare as hard as I ever have in my life to beat them next year.”
Despite his mid-season injury, Justice Shelton-Mosley earned a unanimous selection to the All-Ivy first team. That award continued a trend from 2015, when the wideout unanimously won Rookie of the Year.
Heading into the 2017 season, Shelton-Mosley is the most decorated Crimson player. Where he goes, the program likely will follow.
For two weeks after The Game, the sophomore rested. He processed emotions, healed injuries, and enjoyed relative freedom.
By Dec. 7, however, he had returned to work. Always, the next season beckons.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Growing up, the NCAA Tournament was my favorite sporting event—the combination of upsets, close finishes, and the predictive element of filling out a bracket always had me counting down the days until March. I remember rushing home from middle school on Thursday and Friday of the opening weekend of the tournament so that I could catch the end of the first slate of games.
So, when I stepped into The Crimson as a freshman, I was set on becoming a men’s basketball writer. Harvard was on the rise, having just won its first ever NCAA Tournament game against New Mexico the previous year. Being able to cover Tommy Amaker and Wesley Saunders during the Ivy League season and, perhaps, at the NCAA Tournament seemed like the ideal path for me at The Crimson. 
Plans, of course, are subject to change.
Entering junior year, I was entering my second full season covering the men's hockey and women's volleyball teams. That year, two spots on the men’s basketball beat opened up following the graduations of two former writers. Yet, despite my initial plans as a freshman, I decided to pass up a shot at those openings and stick with women’s volleyball and men’s hockey.
At a certain point during the first two years of covering and watching Harvard sports, I had realized how much the basketball program meant to my student experience. I had formed some of my better friendships at home games, and attending contests in the student section was one of the activities that I most looked forward to during the week. Covering the team would mean trading free Harvard basketball t-shirts for jackets and ties, cheering whenever Robert Baker subbed into a game or took a three-pointer for silent note-taking, and partiality for neutrality.
Some of my favorite Harvard memories came in the basketball student section, whether it was storming the court at the Palestra after beating Yale in the Ivy League tiebreaker, watching Siyani’s and-one three-pointer against UNC in Jacksonville that almost knocked off Roy Williams’ squad, or watching any regular season game at Lavietes. In the end, I felt that those memories were worth more than the chance to cover the Harvard men’s basketball program, especially since I enjoyed covering the accomplished women’s volleyball and men’s hockey teams.
Even as I grow older, college basketball is one of the things that I still truly, irrationally love. Even while at Harvard, I never fell out of love with Jim Boeheim and his Syracuse basketball program that I had grown up religiously watching. Over the course of the past four years, I’ve flown to Durham and mooched off of a friend to see Syracuse take down Duke at Cameron Indoor, and drove back and forth to Syracuse in February to witness John Gillon’s buzzer-beater against the Blue Devils. I vividly remember looking like an idiot in a library freshman year when I yelled after Tyler Ennis hit a buzzer-beater against Pitt to move the Orange to 24-0. No matter how busy I was in college, I almost always made time to watch each game.
At a place as intense as Harvard, it’s important to love things that don’t actually matter. For as much of a blessing as Harvard can be, it comes with the burden of expectation. Most of the time—save weekend nights—it’s tough to walk 100 feet in any direction without seeing someone who’s working. Incentives matter and time is valuable, and, for most students here, there’s no return on spending two hours at a Harvard-Columbia basketball game. Yet, for me, Harvard basketball was instrumental to my student experience, creating outlets for excitement, debate, and school spirit that rarely flares up at this school—save Housing Day and the annual release of the U.S. and News World Report college rankings.
Irrational love is an incredible part of the human experience. Sometimes, it’s better to pass up being part of the action and watch from the sidelines—whether literally or figuratively.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I have been an athlete all my life and it was an identity that I held as I transitioned from high school to college.
In high school, I played softball and volleyball and when I came to Harvard, I joined the women’s club volleyball team and have found community there for the past four years. However, this year has not been easy on female athletes at Harvard. It has not been easy on women in general, but this is a sports column so I won’t get into that.
When the scouting report by the men’s soccer team came out earlier this year, it was a blow not only to the members of the women’s soccer team; I think all women at Harvard connected to the world of sports were impacted by it.
I could relate to what the women on the soccer and later cross country teams were probably feeling. A mixture of anger and astonishment boiled up, yet it was not completely surprising because we have all been objectified while playing our sport. The thing that was shocking was that it was coming from other Harvard students, many times from close friends. That was the thing that was hard to wrap my mind around. The people who were supposedly sharing your sport and training with you to get better on the field were turning around and documenting blatantly sexist things.
Being a woman in sports journalism has also had its ups and downs. Walking into media rooms and press boxes, I was often the only woman there, which is not surprising but still makes me wonder why it is so uncommon for women to write for the sports sections of newspapers. When I started becoming more comfortable in the male-dominated spaces and began striking up conversations with fellow writers, I realized that there was always an assumption that I did not know as much as the other guys or that I could not possibly have as much sports knowledge as they did. I could make up for it in my writing but I can understand why other women could be turned off to a career in which you are constantly being tested on your knowledge.
In the industry at large, there also seems to be limited space for women to break into the spotlight. Jessica Mendoza, one of the greatest softball players ever, recently joined ESPN’s Sunday Night Baseball coverage and was met with an inordinate amount of criticism because she is a woman. More recently, LaVar Ball demanded that sports talk show host Kristine Leahy ‘stay in her lane’, implying the sports world is not one in which women belong. These sentiments can weather anyone down, even when they have made it to the top of their professional careers.
Luckily, when I joined The Crimson, I was met with an environment that was open to anyone wanting to comp. I thought that at a school like Harvard I would have a hard time finding people who were interested in sports as much as I was, but showing up to the first couple board meetings made me quickly feel like I had found a great place to anchor myself. One of my comp directors was even female! Would ya look at that?
It was also through The Crimson that I met some of my best guy friends that I could count on to be at every basketball and hockey game that I was attending. I’m thankful for them and the lack of judgment surrounding the fact that I was the only girl often coming to the games with them.
My sophomore year the sports board was run by two women, which was pretty dang cool. I didn’t realize it at the time, but Juliet and Cordelia (wo)manning the ship allowed me to visualize myself in a leadership position on the board as well. Though I was reluctant at first to be in charge of the sports board of the 143, the position became something I was proud of. I often got confused for males during e-mail exchanges, and on more than one occasion a person I was interviewing thought that I was a guy. Surprising them with my voice on the phone always gave me a small amount of joy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Siyani Chambers’ path to being one of the best players to ever put on a Harvard uniform was anything but smooth.
At first, he had no interest in coming to a relatively unproven basketball program, but after visiting campus and talking to the coaching staff, he decided to buy into the vision that Coach Amaker laid out for him as the Crimson’s next point guard.
After co-captains Brandyn Curry and Kyle Casey withdrew just before the start of his freshman season, Siyani found himself with the starting spot firmly in hand. While matching up with future pros, including Shabazz Napier, Matthew Dellavedova, and Langston Galloway, he became the first freshman to be named to the All-Ivy first team. He then led Harvard to the program’s first NCAA Tournament win, as a 14-seed, against New Mexico.
Siyani hosted me on my official visit not too long after that win, and while I was spending time with him throughout the weekend, he obviously got a lot of love from people on campus. He was appreciative, but if you know Siyani, the last thing he does is bask in accomplishments. All he was talking to me about was the next season: improving, developing chemistry with the soon-to-be-reinstated players, and following up with another Ivy League title. That told me all I needed to know about what kind of player and competitor he is. He was ready for an encore. That’s how Siyani is.
Siyani and Coach Amaker have a very strong bond, and it comes from trust and mutual respect between them. Coach knows that Siyani was essentially an extension of him on the floor, in the locker room, and across the River, in terms of leading by example and making sure guys were on top of their stuff.
When I showed up as a freshman, I don’t think Siyani and I had a full conversation for at least a month or two. It felt like he was testing me. I felt like once the season rolled around, I had started to prove myself and started earning the respect from him that we have built up over four years. We had the best team in program history that year, and part of it was because of how competitive practices were. I was lucky to have been able to go at it with those guys and really learn what it was like to compete, especially with guarding Siyani everyday.

Coming off of three straight NCAA tournament appearances, and three straight all-conference nods, Siyani spent the summer after his junior season in Portland working for Adidas. He was able to work out with All-Star guard Damian Lillard and really fine-tune some parts of his game. That’s when he got the news that he had torn his ACL in a workout.
Obviously, this development was devastating to him, the team, and the coaches. We knew what it meant for our program: We were already very young, and now we would be missing our captain, our floor general. He could have stayed in school that year, graduated, and played his fifth year of eligibility almost anywhere. Any big-time program with a scholarship available would have offered him. He had earned it and, to me, had nothing left to prove. What he had accomplished here was enough.
Not to him, though.
Siyani withdrew from Harvard to rehabilitate his knee and retain his eligibility, and he ended up working in the Athletic Department during the spring so that he could be around the team. He developed relationships with the freshmen that he had never played with. He gave advice to upperclassmen on leading the team. He made us better despite not stepping on the floor. Again that’s how Siyani is.
Unfortunately, in my time to help fill the void at point guard, I tore my ACL in our second game. Siyani was there for me. Seeing him around campus and watching his journey to come back was inspiring to everyone. He was ready to prove he hadn’t lost a step.
This season was our senior season, and having Siyani back was a huge benefit for us. Much like having Brandyn as a mentor to Siyani, having Siyani as a mentor to our freshman point guard, Bryce Aiken, was critical. Bryce, a former top-100 recruit, is extremely talented, but where I thought he needed to improve was in his ability to make other players around him better. I think watching Siyani be captain while also making everyone better really helped Bryce develop as a player.
Siyani is one of the best players to ever compete at Harvard. Coach Amaker would say that while Wes Saunders was our “best” player while he was here, Siyani was our “most important” player. That’s a testament to his talent, playmaking ability, and leadership. Thanks, Si, for what you did for Harvard basketball. Good luck on the next chapter of your career, wherever you land.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Many may know June Lee around campus by her infamous Snapchat and Instagram handle, tennisjunelee. However, not everyone is aware that she is one of the hardest-working individuals that has ever stepped onto Harvard’s courts or that her tenacity completely turned around the tennis program.
June spent more time in the training room getting rehab, more time in Palmer Dixon doing extra squats, and more time inside the Murr getting extra feeds than anyone on the team. As a captain, she set an example on how to fight for every ball. In doing so, she inspired the rest of the team to follow her, leading us to our first Ivy League title since 2009.
June’s intense dedication to tennis did not start at Harvard. Her lifelong commitment to the game began at age eight and developed further from there. In high school, she was brave enough to uproot herself from her family and friends in New Jersey to move to Arizona to take her tennis game to the next level. While most of her high school friends were attending prom or football games, June was elevating her game and competing in international tournaments in the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, China, and Brazil.
It was not always an easy road for June during her time as a Harvard athlete, but the adversities that she faced only further displayed the strength of her character. In the middle of her sophomore season, June’s tennis career faced a major setback when she suffered a left wrist sprain. She easily could have sat out the rest of the year but decided to play on with a single hand, refusing to let down her team. It was in these tough moments that June portrayed not only her intense love for the game but also the loyalty that she had for Harvard women’s tennis.
Given that we had seven incoming freshmen this year, we knew that the already difficult task of leading the team would become even more demanding. When choosing captains for the 2016-2017 season, we thought very carefully about who would be the best person to take on such a role.  From the outset, there was no question that we would select June because of her tenacity on the court, her giving nature to help any teammate, and her overall love for Harvard women’s tennis.
Our choice proved to be phenomenal. June embraced the role, and even thrived in it. Throughout the season, she was our leader both on and off the court. Whenever anyone needed advice, she was there to talk with us. Whenever anyone needed someone to hang out with, she was there to spend time with us. Whenever the team needed a home-cooked meal, she cooked for us. She was the glue that held the team together.
On the court, June liked to have fun, but she always knew when it was time to work.  The combination of her lighthearted attitude and focus made practice productive yet enjoyable. June held each and every one of us to the highest standard.  She would not be afraid to call us out whenever we were goofing off, and she was driving the force to make sure everyone was working their hardest.
At the beginning of every year, we set a goal of winning the Ivy League, but these last few years we have fallen short. With June holding the reins, our goal finally became a reality. As each member of the team has grown and improved underneath June’s guidance, Harvard women’s tennis is set up for success for years to come.
Upon entrance into the Harvard tennis program, we have always been told by our coaches to honor the team with respect and leave the program in a better place than we found it. June has more than excelled in earning the team’s respect by posting impressive results all four years and by being supportive of all her teammates. After taking this team from a losing record to an Ivy title, June undoubtedly will have a lasting effect on this program.
June, it has been an honor competing on the court next to you, and Harvard women’s tennis has been forever changed for the better with your meaningful impact. The whole team has greatly admired how you have grown as a player on the court and as such a thoughtful person off it. We have complete faith that you will take on the next adventure of post-college life with the same fighting spirit that you exemplified on the court over the past four years.
You may no longer be tennisjunelee, but you are forever our cherished teammate. We cannot thank you enough for all that you have done for us. We love you, June, and your team will still be here cheering you on wherever life takes you.

Falleció tu Papa Chak
Or something like that. I honestly don’t remember because the second I heard the words falleció (passed away) and Papa Chak (the nickname I had for my Grandpa since I was little), I essentially blacked out. I remember my dad telling me not to freak out, my mom crying, and an overwhelming feeling of anxiety.
That Monday before 2016 commencement, I was chilling in the room in Pfoho that was my temporary housing for Crimson commencement. We had finished the Year in Sports issue the day before, and I had spent most of the day relaxing and looking forward to saying goodbye to the Crimson seniors that night.
The second my dad called, though, it felt as if someone had ripped away a piece of my heart. There was no way to escape the pain.
***
For as long as I can remember, sports have provided a way to make friends and an escape valve. As a five-year old who had just immigrated from Mexico, knew no English, and had no friends, I made friends at the soccer field at my elementary school. On the field, I was just another kid.
It was the same whenever I moved to a new school. Even for games that I had no idea how to play, all it would take was a few minutes before I was holding my own, arguing every detail with new friends.
I learned from my dad to turn sports—both playing and watching them—into an escape. I go running or play soccer or pickup when I’m stressed out. I watch highlights when I get stuck doing homework, and to this day, I’ll drop whatever I’m doing to watch games.
So, naturally, I gravitated towards sports when I decided to comp The Crimson. It was freshman spring, and I felt that I had wasted my fall semester not comping anything useful.
Walking into 14p ended up being one of the best decisions in my years here. On a campus that more often left me feeling beat up and broken, Crimson Sports was an escape valve and a place where I felt that I truly belonged.
Covering events across the River allowed me to escape from troubles for a few hours and—silently, because good journalists are objective—grow close to three teams (track and field, women’s hockey, and men’s soccer) that I covered.
The more I involved myself in Crimson Sports, the more I found myself across the River, even for sports I didn’t cover. I screamed my throat dry at basketball, football, and hockey games.
But the best thing about joining Crimson Sports is the people. The 143 is one of the closest groups of friends I have at Harvard. The hours that I’ve spent watching games, doing work, and just hanging out rank as one of the best parts of college.
If there’s one group on campus where I always felt that I belonged, it was Sports. That group represents a space that catalyzed my growth as a person. A space where, even if things were going completely south, I could lose myself for a few hours and just focus on something that I love.
It’s weird thinking that Sports and 14p won’t be a regular part of my life next year. Luckily for me, the most important part of Sports isn’t something that I’ll lose once I leave campus.
***
The night of my grandpa’s death, I was over 2,000 miles away from my family and contemplating staying in for the rest of the night. I’m not 100 percent sure why, but I decided to go to the Crimson anyway. I told my co-chair about my grandpa’s death, and a couple of other people in Sports found out as well, all of them expressing their support.
I had planned to leave after an hour or so, thinking that I’d probably feel the urge to break down. But something convinced me to stay. It didn’t matter that few people knew what I was going through or that I was in a place where I couldn’t openly grieve.
That night made me realize that Crimson Sports was a second family to me. Being able to be with them and share a few laughs and drinks helped me through one of the hardest moments in my life. Sports reminded me that everything would be all right.
That night, years after finding my place on that kindergarten soccer field, I fully realized that I had found my place all over again, with a group of people I could count on to get me through hard times.
Like I said, I don't remember much from the night my grandpa died, nor do I think about it often. But as I think about it now, there's one thing I can be certain of: Wherever he was, watching over me, Papa Chak was happy that I had found my place at Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the biggest stage, they fell just short.
Trinity sophomore Michael Craig and the rest of the Bantams stopped their momentum and flattened their hopes in mere seconds. The prospect of winning a 32nd national championship failed to materialize, but a phenomenal run of success helped provide them that chance at glory.
Over the past few months, the No. 2 Harvard men’s squash team had perhaps its best spell of play since it last won the CSA National Team Championships during the 2013-2014 season.
The Crimson (13-2, 7-0 Ivy League) completed an undefeated Ancient Eight season en route to a No. 2 ranking. Along the way, Harvard continued to accumulate victories against top-ten competition, besting each of the eight teams ranked below it in the category. St. Lawrence, Columbia, Rochester, Drexel, Penn, Yale, Dartmouth, and Princeton proved unable to match the Crimson’s quality.
One team had Harvard’s number, though. Trinity, winners of 16 national titles in the last 20 years, handed the Crimson its two defeats in heartbreaking fashion, both 5-4. The teams were ranked one-two in both meetings, with one coming during the regular season and the other in the National Team Championship final. As momentum swung back and forth throughout, both matches could have gone to either team.
Individually, Harvard players had strong seasons, as well. In the CSA Individual National Championships, freshman Saadeldin Abouaish reached the quarterfinals in the Pool division, while sophomore Alexi Gosset claimed victory in the consolation bracket of the Molloy North division.
The squad finished with a 103-32 record overall in individual matches across its 15 team competitions. Many of those wins came in dominant fashion over three sets.
“I'm happy with the season on a whole,” freshman Sean Hughes said. “I think the Ivy League championship and our strong road wins against St. Lawrence and Rochester were some of the high points of the season.”
After consecutive 6-3 road wins against No. 3 St. Lawrence (14-4, 5-0 Liberty League) and No. 5 Rochester (13-4, 3-2 Liberty League) during a late January weekend during winter break, the Crimson vaulted up to the nation’s top ranking. Harvard found the majority of its success against the Saints and Yellowjackets at the No. 4 through No. 8 positions. The quintet accounted for nine of the team’s 12 victories over the weekend.
Before its losses to the then-undefeated Crimson, Rochester was the top-ranked squad in the nation, having bested No. 1 Trinity (19-1, 6-0 NESCAC) the weekend before, 5-4. By season’s end, the Yellowjackets were the only squad to knock off the Bantams.
When considering what drove the team’s success this year, Hughes credits the strong work ethic present in the group and cohesive team dynamic that players developed. This closeness helped team members feed off one another when competing in matches and developing their game during practice.
“I think when a team gets a lot of strong and driven players like we had this past year, everyone pushes each other to work harder,” Hughes said.
Largely, team leaders and returning players set that social tone. But one would be remiss to neglect the contribution of the Crimson’s rookies to its recent run of success. In the squad’s two losses to the Bantams, the freshmen played an important role, nearly dragging the team to victory.
In both matches, the Crimson jumped out to early leads that Hughes’ victories helped build. Those early advantages faded in the next wave of matches, however, and it was up Abouaish to stop the slide. During the regular season, the Cairo, Egypt native was unable to execute the task, but in the championship final, he unflinchingly fought his way to a crucial victory against Trinity freshman Kush Kumar in three sets.
Another match featuring a Harvard freshman went down to the wire. Freshman Timmy Brownell took his match with Craig to to a fifth set. With the teams locked in a dead heat at 4-4, the crowds filled in behind the glass waiting in anticipation. Discernibly exhausted, the Belmont, Mass., native continually returned one impressive shot from his opponent after another, throwing himself all over the court.
Brownell ultimately gave way to Craig in spirited showings on both occasions, leading to agonizing defeats. But the fact that the team came so close with the help of these freshman was an accomplishment in itself.
In their other matches throughout the season, the rookies thrived. Abouaish completed the campaign with a 10-5 record while playing at the No. 1 position. Along the way, he picked up a dominant 3-0 victory against the winner of the CSA Individual National Championships, Columbia junior Osama Khalifa, 11-9, 11-5, 11-1.
Hughes went undefeated, 14-0, in his individual campaign with most of his matches coming at the No. 6 position. Brownell finished 12-2, with his only blemishes coming to Craig at the fourth slot. Hughes had the first undefeated rookie campaign for Harvard since junior David Ryan accomplished the feat in 2014-2015.
“The freshmen especially performed incredibly well,” co-captain Bryan Koh said. “Sean plays with huge intent and obsesses over what is the right and wrong thing to do in situations, which gives him the extra focus. Timmy is as relaxed as one can be in a national final, allowing him to play freely and move his opponent around confidently. Saad is incredibly talented with the way he strikes the ball, and his speed makes it that much harder for opponents to read him.”
Hailing from Newton Square, Pa., Belmont, Mass., and Cairo, Egypt, the three freshmen used their varied backgrounds and styles of play to become a successful part of the larger team unit right from the outset. As they became more comfortable, everything started to come more easily. Brownell credits this transition to his older teammates.
“I think that the freshman class had so much success this season because our teammates went above and beyond to make us feel like a part of the family from day one,” Brownell said.
Individualized training sessions and targeted between-game insight from seventh-year head coach Mike Way similarly helped as part of the process.
“As a freshman, I was very happy with Mike [Way] and the rest of the coaching staff,” Hughes said. “Mike is good at allotting a lot of time to individual players and was very helpful in my game’s development throughout the season. I think I played better as the season progressed, and played my best squash at the end.”
While all three of these players were new to the college circuit this season, they were no strangers to competitive squash. Before coming to Harvard, the trio played heavily in prominent domestic and international tournaments.
In juniors, Abouaish earned the world’s top ranking for a period, finished third at the 2015 World Junior Championships, and was a runner-up at the 2016 tournament. He also finished as a three-time runner-up in the British Junior Open.
Hughes and Brownell made more noise on the U.S. circuit, although both Americans also competed in the 2015 World Junior Championships. In the 128-man tournament, Abouaish bested Hughes in the second round, 11-6,11-7,11-4, en route to his third-place finish. Meanwhile, Brownell lost in the round of 16 to the eventual champion, Peruvian national Diego Elías.
Domestically, Brownell was the 2014 U19 U.S. Junior Open Champion and a three-time U.S. Squash All-American, while Hughes was a three-time national champion and a four-time All-American. Moreover, in back-to-back years, both finished as runners-up in 4-3 losses to Brunswick School in the U.S. High School Team Squash Championships first division.
This seasoning on the junior circuit served the rookies well. Accolades have accumulated as a result of standout play. For his efforts, Abouaish won Ivy League Rookie of the Year and earned a place on the College Squash Association All-American and All-Ivy first teams. Brownell was a First Team All-Ivy pick as well.
Rookies were not the only members of the Crimson to distinguish themselves. In recognition of their accomplishments this season, junior Madhav Dhingra, junior Bradley Smith, and Way received notable honors. Way earned Ivy League Coach of the Year, while Dhingra and Smith were granted First Team All-Ivy status for the second and third times in their three-year careers, respectively.
While graduating seniors did not garner as many accolades, the veteran cohort played an important role. Koh, Dylan Murray, and co-captain Devin McLaughlin collectively sported a 32-6 record this season while playing at the seventh, eighth, and ninth positions, respectively. McLaughlin even polished off a perfect 13-0 record in his final act.
The group’s consistent presence at the bottom of the ladder provided stability to the squad, which allowed those above them to play more freely and focus in on their own game. Their steadying presence on the court and in the locker room nearly allowed them to bookend their careers with national titles.
Looking to the future, a majority of the Crimson’s top nine players return to the squad next year. In fact, all of Harvard’s top six players return. However, other top competition is also retaining much of its talent, leaving the Crimson much work to do in the coming months.
“Trinity has a very strong program right now and edged us 5-4 in both matches,” Hughes said. “We keep six of our top nine players next year, and they also keep the majority of their top nine players. I'm looking forward to playing them again next year.”
With another year of experience under their belt, newly elected co-captains Dhingra and Rya, must continue to set the hardworking tone that Harvard maintained throughout the 2016-2017 season.
“That's something I want us to carry on for next year, as I can only hope our incoming freshman have as positive an experience as we did,” Brownell said. “We've always been a talented team, but I think this season showed that a great team dynamic is the real difference maker between top-notch teams that we compete against.”

For the Harvard men’s ice hockey team, the 2016-2017 season marked one of the most dominant senior class performances in the program’s history. The seven fourth-years, headlined by an all-senior second line and steady leadership from co-captains Alexander Kerfoot and Devin Tringale, collectively totaled 193 points during the year.
The Crimson, however, would have been far from a Frozen Four team had it not received contributions from some of its younger members. Junior goaltender Merrick Madsen, sophomore forward Ryan Donato, and freshman defenseman John Marino all impacted the season immensely, but it was rookie blueliner Adam Fox who had perhaps the most influence.
"The impact that he has had as a freshman here has been unbelievable," said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 to the Boston Herald in March. "Offensively, he is so dynamic, and his hockey IQ and puck skills are really amongst the best that there is in college hockey. He makes big plays in big games and makes the players around him that much better…. He's playing chess while everyone else is playing checkers.”

The star freshman filled an invaluable role for the Crimson this season, rounding out the back end’s top four while manning the point on the team’s first power play unit, whose .264 conversion percentage was fourth in the NCAA. Fox distinguished himself not only from other first-years but from the entire Division-I field, too.
The Jericho, N.Y., native finished the season atop all defensemen in points and assists, with 40 and 34, respectively. Fox also set the scoring pace with the man-advantage, tallying 22 assists and 24 points overall on the power play. Moreover, he ranked fourth in points among freshmen and was the only blue-liner among the NCAA’s top 22 point scoring rookies.
Fox was downright lethal all season, and the league took notice.
“I wish Fox had too many beers two nights ago so he couldn’t play,” said Princeton coach Ron Fogarty after his Tigers dropped a game to the Crimson in early January. “He’s a really good hockey player.”
And what the 5’10” point man lacks in size, he compensates for in speed and craftiness.
“The way he handles the puck and the way he passes the puck, he might as well be a forward,” said Ed Krayer ’89-90, scorer of the overtime goal that gave Harvard its only NCAA Championship title back in 1989. “He’s a great player and I love watching him play.”
Fox’s scoring total this season fell just six points shy of Harvard’s all-time record for a defenseman, set by Mark Fusco ’83 in his senior season, for which he won the Hobey Baker Memorial Award, given to the best player in college hockey. The Crimson’s most recent Hobey winner, Jimmy Vesey ’16, notched only 18 points in his first campaign.

Fox reached historic or near-historic levels on multiple other fronts this season. After he fell just four passes short of Harvard’s all-time record for single-season assists by a defenseman, his passing prowess still has him on pace to hold the school’s career record in the category. Compared to this year’s Hobey winner, Denver’s senior defenseman Will Butcher,  Fox finished with more assists and points despite playing in eight games less.
This type of play is what it will take for Fox and his fellow Crimson icemen to debunk the notion that Harvard, lacking the scholarships and overall recruiting leverage of some of the nation’s hockey powerhouses, is not an annual NCAA title threat.
“We’re definitely trying to break the mold and show that we can have success,” said Fox. “I think we’ve done a pretty good job of that this year.”
The Calgary Flames prospect played in all 35 games for which he was available this season—his sole absence from the Crimson lineup, for a late December matchup with RPI, is quite easily explained.
While Harvard battled at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center in Cambridge, Fox was in Toronto, Can., donning the red, white, and blue as a member of the U.S. World Junior Championship roster. Fox played in all seven games for the stars and stripes en route to the U.S.’s gold medal victory over Canada in a shootout.
“It’s one of the biggest stages for hockey, so I was just so happy that we won,” Fox said. “And being able to do that with guys you’re so close with is something really special and something I’ll keep with me.”
The rookie blue-liner, of course, had the full support of his team despite the one-game absence.
“We’re all pulling for him; it’s such a great tournament and a great stage,” said Donato about the World Junior Championships after a Fox-less Harvard’s win over RPI. “I think he deserves the opportunity. He’s earned it. He’s had a great start to the season here for us. We’re excited to watch him play…[and] we’ll certainly be excited to get him back.”
With countless moments of brilliance throughout the season, such as an impressive 11 multi-point performances, it’s no wonder that the awards came flooding in after Fox’s freshman campaign.
The defenseman received the major honors of First Team CCM/AHCA All-American, ECAC Hockey and Ivy League Rookie of the Year, and ECAC and Ivy first team selection. In addition, Fox was named to the tournament team for both the ECAC and NCAA East Regional playoffs. Within the walls of Harvard, Fox, along with fellow first-year Nathan Krusko, earned the honor of the George Percy Award as the premiere rookie for the Crimson.
These accolades are simply testament to the fact that Adam Fox, Harvard’s puck wizard on the blue line, put forth one of the most impressive rookie seasons of any athlete on campus this year.

Entering the 2016 season, Harvard men’s water polo had its sights firmly set on a long-held goal—to win the Northeast Water Polo Conference for the first time in program history.
The Crimson achieved that goal, but didn’t stop there. Coach Ted Minnis’ squad kept winning, in unexpected fashion, all the way to the Final Four of the NCAA tournament.
“I think the team was a much more cohesive unit,” junior co-captain Harry Tafur said. “We focused less on our individual stats and focused more on the team goals and winning and losing as a team. You could feel that from the spring when we were training off season last year, and it carried over into the summer and into the fall. Everyone was not only training and working for themselves but also putting an emphasis on the whole team side of things.”
The Crimson headed into the NWPC tournament with a winning mentality.
In regular season play, Harvard had split its matchups with both Brown and Princeton, perennial East Coast water polo powerhouses. Behind a hat trick from junior Colin Chiapello and two late goals from captain Joey Colton, the Crimson edged out the Tigers by one goal with a 14-13 finish in the semifinal match.
In the championship game against the Bears, Harvard jumped out to a 3-0 lead and never looked back. With a hat trick from junior Harry Tafur and some stifling defense, the Crimson came away with an 11-7 win. The victory gave Harvard the NWPC championship and also clinched one of the coveted seven spots in the NCAA tournament.
"Everything for us is about winning the conference championship, and then everything after that is kind of the icing on the cake," Minnis said. "Our first goal is to win that conference championship, but we also want to win as much as we can."
The journey to the Final Four ran through two high-pressure, overtime play-in games.
The Crimson earned its first ever NCAA championship win in program history against Bucknell in a 13-12 thriller. After trading leads throughout the course of the matchup, the Bison tied up the game 10-10 with only 19 seconds left on the clock.
Bucknell then headed into the second period of overtime with a 12-11 advantage, but a late goal from freshman Austin Sechrest off the assist from Colton put Harvard on the board to force a sudden-death overtime. With the defense tight, sophomore Anthony Ridgley found Tafur flying down the pool to win the game and end what was, without a doubt, the most exciting game of the season.
The Crimson improved its record to 26-6, the best in program history.
In the midst of reading period, the team traveled to Berkeley, Calif., to play University of California, Davis, for a chance at the Final Four. Eleven of the 16 players on Harvard’s roster are California products, so the playoff game was essentially a homecoming.
“Not only is most of our team from California, but [also] most of our alumni still live out there and have family out there. It was great to see current players’ families, old players, their families, families that support our program,” Tafur said. “They all came out to Berkeley and watched a ton of our games. It was awesome to see just how influential the Crimson water polo has been to so many people throughout time and how it has impacted their lives.”
Again, Harvard knew a win against UC Davis was within reach, having split two games against the Aggies in regular season play and falling by just a single goal the last time out.
A close round of regulation play ended with a late goal UC Davis that tied the score at 14-14, forcing yet another overtime game. In the first part of this extra period, senior Viktor Wrobel found the back of the net to give the Crimson the early 15-14 advantage. In the second period, with 55 seconds left, Sechrest scored to provide Harvard a two-goal cushion and secure the Crimson’s victory.
Ultimately, Harvard defeated the Aggies, 16-15, to earned a spot in the Final Four, rewriting history once again.
Although the season ended with a 19-4 loss to the University of Southern California, the Crimson had already reached new heights. Thanks to the historic run, Harvard has put its name at the top of East Coast water polo.
“It was just about enjoying it, enjoying the moment, and continuing to write the story that we were having for that season,” Minnis said. “I think once we kind of sat back and enjoyed it and the pressure was off for winning the [conference] championship, we just started playing really well and continued to play really well."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Growing up in suburban Los Angeles in the early 2000s naturally meant that I was a Lakers fan. Kobe’s 30-plus shot nights at Staples, Shaq’s rim-rattling dunks, Derek Fisher’s last second daggers, Pau Gasol’s midrange J’s—all these are forever stained into my memory.
Our family didn’t believe in cable television, or so I was told—Saturday mornings were meant for the Little League diamond down in the Arroyo, not for staring at a screen. But they believed in sports, so there were these weekly moments when the Lakers would be on the local analog KTLA-5 channel, and I could alternate between watching the game and adjusting the antenna with its makeshift tinfoil cover so that the screen wouldn’t be too grainy.
This happy compromise meant that my father could sit there for a 7:30 p.m. start time with me and catch snippets of the game as well, even if that meant dozing off during a fourth quarter 30-second timeout.
I forgave him then because he was a Celtics fan. There was no forgiveness in 2008 when Boston won, and no forgiveness given during 2010: redemption year. The devastation that came with the 2008 Game 4 comeback and 39-point drubbing of my purple and gold in the decisive Game 6 and the jubilation of sweet, sweet revenge two years later still stick with me now.
The original big three of KG, Ray Allen, and the Truth for the goons in green meant that there was no sleeping to be had in May and June. Suddenly, the gentle ribbing of a Mamba brick turned into playful arguments, which turned into fierce verbal competitions, and these games meant the world to me. We fought for the fan support of my four-year-old brother; I had bought him a youth XS Lakers shirt, to which my father parried and riposted with a Garnett shirt of his own. Cackling and laughing at the added attention, my brother would run around the room carrying the gold shirt in his left hand, shamrock green in his right as we would try to convince him to wear the “right” shirt and cheer for the “right” team.
The two of us—my father and I—sat on opposite ends of the couch to emphasize our rivaling fandom. I imitated Kobe’s tongue wagging while he did his best KG trash-talking. As the two future Hall of Famers jabbed at each other across the court, so would we across our living room.
In those moments, we couldn’t have been any closer. Kobe and KG could leave the court at the buzzer and not see each other until the next contest, but we shut off the TV and returned to being family. The games intertwined with our relationship, becoming a bedrock in our shared trust. That continues, Kobe and KG retirement notwithstanding.
Sports can tell stories, but once in awhile, sports are the story. The narrative that stretched through my life up to college was dictated by sports, with personal maxims that were rooted in the game, whatever that game was.
To never walk between the white lines of the baseball diamond—always run and give the game the respect it deserves. That championships are won when the worst players become the best worst players in the league. That your coaches’ criticism means that you’re worth fighting for. That the right attitude can be worth more than talent. That practice doesn’t make perfect—perfect practice makes perfect. To treat the bench as a test of responding to adversity.
Though I was never cut out to be a Division I athlete, The Crimson sports board gave me access to telling these stories of the game that evolve into the lessons of life. Fencing or golf, baseball or squash, any true sport has the power to reflect character and lives beyond the strip, court, or field. If journalism is the first draft of history, then my foray into sports journalism must have been the first draft for who I am to become.

Throughout the past season, Harvard basketball coach Tommy Amaker tended to describe his team’s success through a certain formula.
This formula was simple—“bench and balance.”
It was also true. In a conference dominated by teams with one or two stars, Amaker’s squad was deeper than most. On a given night, he would often play more than half his 20 player roster.
The special aspect about the Crimson’s bench, though, wasn’t necessarily its depth or balance. In fact, what stood out was often the efforts of a single player—freshman guard Bryce Aiken.
Playing at Yale in February, Harvard’s reserves combined for 34 points. However, 27 of those 34 points came courtesy of Aiken off the bench. Of the Crimson’s 26 games, the freshman started nine but still managed to end the season as Harvard’s leading scorer. If there were an award for Sixth Man of the Year in the Ivy League, Aiken would no doubt be on the shortlist.
He would have to settle for Ivy League Rookie of the Year and an All-Ivy first-team nod.
The numbers speak for themselves. The freshman averaged nearly 15 points a game to go with 2.8 assists and 2.2 rebounds. He was the first freshman to lead Harvard in scoring since 1988. Reflecting on that performance against Yale on the road, Amaker hardly seemed surprised.
“We recruited him to do exactly what he’s doing for our team—have an impact,” Amaker said. “He’s capable of that, and he’s capable of these kinds of nights.”

Aiken certainly had an impact, but it’s an impact that went beyond sheer scoring. On a team full of talent, Aiken, much like co-captain Siyani Chambers, was a player Amaker gave a green light to on offense.
At times, this green light could end in performances like the contest at UMass, when the freshman went 0-of-9 from the field for six points and four turnovers in 23 minutes.
At his best, though, Aiken seemed unstoppable.
He made this ability clear in the season opener. Playing against Stanford in Shanghai, he led all Harvard scorers with 21 points off the bench. In contrast to a team—and largely a conference—that thrives beyond the perimeter, Aiken showed early and often that he would drive into the paint. He finished that game 8-of-8 from the line.
While Aiken bounced from highs to low, he brought a brand of consistency that not many players on the Crimson could. In a tight game, Amaker could always count on the freshman to show up.
This tendency was on display against Houston, in what arguably ranked as Harvard’s toughest nonconference matchup.
With just over five minutes left on the clock and the Crimson down seven, the freshman missed a jumper from the elbow. He got his own rebound, kicked the ball out to classmate Justin Bassey, and then got the ball back for a three near the left corner.
Thirty seconds later, and after a stop on the other end, Chambers drove the ball inside and kicked it to Aiken in the same spot. Aiken drained the second three and Harvard was within one with just over four minute to play.
After the two teams traded baskets, Aiken held the ball at the top of the key with just over a minute left on the clock. He dribbled the ball between his legs and found a cutting Zena Edosomwan for a layup that put the Crimson up by one. That score would prove to be the go-ahead basket as Harvard won, 57-56.
Aiken finished the game with 21 points—13 alone in the second half on 3-of-4 shooting from deep—to go with three assists, three steals, and three rebounds.

The freshman’s production only continued.
In the Crimson’s next game, Aiken topped his previous performance, putting up 23 points on 7-of-11 shooting from the field and 6-of-9 from three-point range. All told, he would average 17 points per game in the month of December. And Harvard wouldn’t lose a single game.
“Bryce’s offensive ability is changing the game for us,” said Amaker after the game. “He’s done that now for the last two games where his shot-making ability just changes it, and that’s certainly something that we needed and will continue to need.”
The dominance didn’t stop once Ivy League play began, either.
Against Cornell, Aiken took over in clutch minutes once more. With just under a minute left on the clock and the Big Red up by a point, the freshman drove inside and kicked the ball out to Bassey in the corner. The wingman drained the three to put Harvard up by two.
After getting a stop on the other end, Aiken dribbled up the ball and let the shot clock wind down. With just over 10 seconds on the clock and two on the shot clock, the freshman drove inside and took a step back jumper from the elbow. The shot found nothing but twine and sealed the road win. He finished the game with 21 points on 5-of-8 shooting.
“Big-time play by him,” Bassey said. “He’s a savvy point guard, [and] he hit the shot at the end of the game. That’s why we have him and why we trust him with the ball.”
Aiken downed Cornell, but it was against Yale where the freshman always brought his best game.
It started with that away game against the Bulldogs in February. After a 12-point first half, he hushed a rowdy New Haven crowd with a three and the foul to put the Crimson on top, 55-53. Harvard led the rest of the way, as Aiken finished with 27 points, three rebounds, and two assists. It was Yale’s first home loss in over two years.
Then came the matchup against Bulldogs at home. In what went down as a runaway win for the Crimson, Aiken finished with 22 points on 5-of-8 shooting from beyond the arc to go with five assists and three steals.
His best outing, however, came in Harvard’s last game.
Playing for a spot in the championship game of the inaugural Ivy League tournament, Aiken topped his previous performances against Yale. After scoring eight points in the first frame on an afternoon when the Crimson couldn’t find the bottom of the net, the freshman nearly willed Harvard to a win on his own.
Over a period of four minutes midway through the second half, the freshman scored 12 of 15 points for the Crimson. The heroics came from Aiken and Aiken alone—only one of the freshman’s buckets came off an assist.
With 1:14 left on the clock, the Bulldogs’ held the lead at 71-66. With Yale forward Sam Downey switched onto him, Aiken dribbled left through a pick from classmate Seth Towns. He pulled up from deep and connected to put Harvard within two.
The Crimson ultimately fell, but Aiken finished with 20 points in that second half and a career-high 28 overall.
“He’s a creative shot-maker and playmaker, and we needed him to do exactly that,” Amaker said. “I thought he did a tremendous job of putting us in position to have an opportunity to pull it out. We wouldn’t have even been close if he wasn’t able to have some heroic shots and big plays that he made for our team.”

On the surface, it might seem that Aiken fills the void left behind by Chambers. After all, the freshman is the only other player in league history to win Ivy League Rookie of the Year honors and receive an All-Ivy first-team selection. The impact of Aiken, however, differs from that of the four-time All-Ivy guard.
Speaking on Chambers’ departure and Aiken’s growing role at the end of the season, Amaker was careful to assign the freshman the “quarterback” role that Chambers held for four years.
“[We’re] certainly not trying to take away from the true nature of his makeup, his DNA,” Amaker said. “We’re not trying to change him. We’re trying to add and grow and develop. But certainly the core of what we have, we’re very pleased with.”

“The biggest game of our careers.”
That was the prevalent mentality for the Harvard men’s water polo team as it prepared for an NCAA Elite Eight game against UC Davis.
At stake was more than the opportunity for the Crimson to represent the East Coast in a tournament filled with West Coast schools. A Harvard victory would also mark the program’s first-ever appearance in the Final Four.
Battling through a hard-fought 16-15 overtime victory, the Crimson completed its goal and set a new milestone for the rising program.
“We wanted to be that first group to turn this program around at Harvard,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “To be able to do that [and] get to the Final Four is pretty amazing. There are not that many opportunities at a school like Harvard to accomplish firsts. To be able to do that is a great feeling.”
The Aggies were no easy opponent. Having lost by one goal in the teams’ regular season matchup, Harvard knew that it was facing an aggressive opponent that had a knack for scoring early in the match and keeping games tight.
A close contest emerged again during the teams’ Elite Eight meeting, as UC Davis delivered three goals in the opening quarter of the game. However, the high-scoring Crimson got off to a hot start too, scoring four consecutive points in the first quarter.
Over the course of the game, four Harvard attackers completed hat-tricks: seniors Joey Colton and Noah Harrison, junior Colin Chiapello, and freshman Charlie Owens.
Still, the Aggies responded effectively to the Crimson’s offensive firepower with dynamic goal-scoring of their own. Harvard saw multi-goal leads disappear and could not hold onto  one-goal leads in the last minutes of the game.
Ultimately, the back-and-forth contest came down to a spurt of offense in overtime. Goals came from senior Viktor Wrobel and freshman Austin Sechrest. Although UC Davis narrowed the deficit by one goal late in the extra period, the Crimson maintained its advantage to close out the game.
The victory carried more than just the ecstasy of defeating a formidable opponent like UC Davis. From a long-term perspective, what matters more is the symbolic message sent to West Coast schools that Harvard should be taken seriously.
“Getting this far in the NCAA Tournament is definitely a step in the right direction.” junior co-captain Harry Tafur said. “I think in the long run, the goal is to be able to compete a national title and it takes step to get there. This will help us in recruiting and sets a higher standard for the team going into next year.”
In echoing these statements, Minnis also emphasized the new challenges that a nationally recognized team like the Crimson will face.
“It will be even harder to do what we did for next year,” Minnis said. “We are going to have a target on our back, something we have never had to deal with. We are going to have to continue to work hard and improve while staying unselfish. I am very excited about the future of this program.”
Reaching the team’s first Final Four appears to be just the starting building block to even higher goals. With the pieces in place to reach this level of competitiveness in future seasons, the men’s water polo program has the opportunity to secure more accomplishments.
Returning for Harvard is sophomore standout Anthony Ridgley, who totaled 230 saves in the season and nine against the Aggies. Tafur will again assume a significant leadership role as one of the senior team leaders, along with Chiapello, the team’s newly-chosen co-captain.
“We had a lot of contributors and were a very deep team this year,” Tafur said. “All around the team we did a fantastic job of stepping up and taking charge when needed. This really helped us in going deep into our bench at times during the season and is something we are hoping to replicate next year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Growing up in the state of Massachusetts has spoiled me as a sports fan.
My first strong sports memory came in the fourth grade when the Red Sox reversed the Curse of the Bambino to win Boston’s first World Series in 86 years. I remember the day of the parade when everyone in my elementary school gathered in the cafeteria to watch. I remember the thrill that my grandfather experienced when, for the first time in his life, he got to see his Red Sox hoisting the Commissioner’s Trophy.
From there, my love of sports grew. I became obsessed and decided that when I grew up, I would be a NESN reporter, and maybe one day grace the desk of SportsCenter. Realizing that I’m not the biggest fan of public speaking, I turned to writing. Fast-forward to the fall of 2013, and I found myself at The Crimson, covering everything from field hockey and water polo to track and swimming.
Three years and over 100 stories later, I’m in Shanghai, China, reporting on a men’s basketball game between Harvard and Stanford as part of the Pac-12 Globalization Initiative. My co-writer Stephen Gleason and I found ourselves on the other side of the globe rather than just the other side of the River to cover Tommy Amaker’s squad.
From the second we touched down in Shanghai, the trip was a whirlwind. Within hours of landing, we had to cover the Crimson as it faced Shanghai Jiao Tong University in an exhibition game. Getting to the game was an adventure that involved a non-English speaking taxi driver who came to a full stop in the off-ramp of a highway as he got lost on the way to the university. We finally arrived just minutes before tip-off, only to be greeted by UCLA great and broadcast character Bill Walton. All of this we did while still wearing the clothes that we had put on when departing Boston at 5 a.m. the previous day.
The rest of the trip was non-stop as we covered the team on cultural visits, a trip to Shanghai Disney, and the official season opener against the Cardinal.
I fell in love with sports because of my local roots. In a city with a rich sports tradition and only one team for each of the major sports, everyone could rally around the Red Sox, Bruins, Patriots, and Celtics. But travelling to China showed me the global influence of sport—that it not only brings locals together based on whom you root for but also connects people from all over the world for the love of the game. Sitting in the press row at Mercedes-Benz Arena, I saw that the fans who filled the seats weren’t necessarily rooting for Harvard or Stanford but were just there to watch good basketball. They roared at every dunk and cheered for every three, regardless of whether it was scored by the Crimson or Cardinal.
When I came back from the trip, my friends and family continually asked why we went all the way to China to write about basketball. But the trip wasn’t about just basketball. It reminded us how lucky we are to go to such a world-renowned place like Harvard. It showed that who wins and loses isn’t always that important. Sometimes it can be just as fun to watch the battle of two teams fighting to the end for pride and glory.
Don’t get me wrong, I’ll always maintain my immense hometown sports pride, no matter what city I end up in next. My non-New England friends have learned firsthand what happens when you try to challenge us locals on Deflategate (Roger Goodell’s failed attempt to dethrone the dynasty), whether Tom Brady is the GOAT (update: he is), or whether the Yankees are truly the Evil Empire (no matter how good or bad they perform in the standings, the Yankees are always rival No. 1).
But at the end of the day, I’ll root for a good game, one in which I can watch two equally matched foes face off until the waning seconds, with the final result coming down to a buzzer-beater or a 50-yard field goal attempt while fans hold their breath in anticipation.
It would be sweeter, though, if those good games end in duck boats rolling past Boston Common.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an age of specialization in sports, most track athletes work on excelling at a single event. Freshman Zoe Hughes is not the average track athlete—she focuses on seven.
Competing in the indoor pentathlon and the outdoor heptathlon, Hughes must juggle sprints, hurdles, jumps, and throws. And throughout the season, she has mastered them all quite well.
Hughes claimed her first collegiate gold at just the second meet of the indoor season, the Harvard Multi Meet, scoring 3,702 points. The following day, she competed in the Beantown Challenge and aided in a gold medal showing by the 4x440 yard relay team.
A week later, she etched her name into the Harvard record books twice on the same day. In the Pentathlon she earned 3,759 points, and she helped run a 3:43.06 in the 4x400 meter relay, both the fourth-best in program history in their respective categories
“Zoe is a really hilarious person, and she brings a lot of really positive energy to the team,” teammate sophomore Gabby Thomas said. “She is very different, and there is really never a dull moment with her around.”
It was at the Indoor Ivy League Heptagonal championships, though, that Hughes really made her name known. Competing for the team in the pentathlon, the Hornchurch, U.K., native won gold with 4,093 points, second-most in program history. The victory was especially significant for Harvard, as it represented the team’s first victory in the event since 2009.
Along her way to achieving the gold, the rookie hit a 6.07-meter mark in long jump. The leap would have beaten a Harvard record that had stood for nine years if the same mark were not eclipsed by classmate Simi Fajemisin on the very same day.
Fajemisin jumped 6.09 meters. Competing separately in the long jump event, Hughes placed fourth.
On the second day of Heps competition, Hughes earned her second gold, this time in the 4x400 meter relay. The Crimson quartet finished in 3:42.02.
Following her Heps performance in the pentathlon, Hughes advanced to the NCAA Indoor Championships, only the second person from Harvard to do so in the event. At the meet in College Station, Texas, the rookie was one of only three freshmen competing in the event. She finished 10th overall, with 4,089 points, the third-best total in school history behind one of her own performances. Following the meet, Hughes was named second-team Indoor All-American.
“She’s very driven and one of the most focused freshman,” Thomas said. “I admire her a lot for that. I think she’s going to be a pretty amazing athlete in the next few years, so I’m looking forward to seeing her develop.”
For the rookie, the transition into the outdoor season was seamless. Two weeks after competing at nationals, Hughes traveled to Florida where she clocked two top-ten program times. In the 100 meter hurdles, she clocked a 13.90 second debut time, Harvard’s fifth-fastest time in the event. Competing in the 4x400 meter relay, Hughes and teammates sophomore Gabby Thomas, senior Jade Miller, and freshman Karina Joiner claimed the tenth-fastest time in program history after running the mile in 3:42.12 seconds.
On April 15, Hughes etched her name into Ivy League history. Competing in the heptathlon at the Mt. SAC Relays, the freshman achieved 5444 points, the second-best in program history and the fourth-best ever in the Ancient Eight.
This performance fed into her Outdoor Ivy Heps competition. Coming off the victory, Hughes took first in the Heptathlon, with 5332 points, and fourth in the long jump after jumping 5.90 meters.
However, as the NCAA Regionals do not host a heptathlon competition and only the top 24 compete at Nationals, Hughes—who is currently ranked 27th—will likely not make the cut. The Hornchurch, U.K., native, though, has her sights set on a different meet.
“I do have European Junior Championships coming up so I’m looking to do another heptathlon before then to qualify,” Hughes said. “That is in Italy in July so that’s the main focus for the rest of my season.”
The meet will be her last of her inaugural college season.
“I plan on just keeping at it and continuing to work,” Hughes said. “Freshman year wasn’t a smooth year, but I think in terms of expectations it definitely exceeded them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Judging solely by the number of people willing to travel the world to visit an oversized set of stairs, Harvard is undoubtedly academia’s Disney World.
But for some of us, like myself—in the words of esteemed Ohio State alumnus Cardale Jones—“we ain’t come here to play school.”
Now of course, that’s by most accounts a lie. This week, I’ll leave the Square ultimately with what I came for: a plethora of free t-shirts, a couple super burritos from Felipe’s, and a degree.
Yet, while courses like “The Art of Looking” and “Introduction to Modern Irish” are sure bets to help me with my future endeavors, smart money is on much of what I’ve learned in the classroom to be forgotten (that is, with the exception of “Tóg go bog é,” a slick-sounding phrase that translates to “Take It Easy” and constitutes the remainder of my Irish fluency).
What won’t be forgotten, on the other hand, is everything else I wound up “playing” here.
Having grown up just outside of Boston, I’ve been surrounded by sports my entire life. In fact, the growth of a collegiate sports behemoth right in my own backyard was what led me to begin thinking about college in the first place.
When I was 11, I watched Jared Dudley carry Boston College to the the Sweet 16. When I was 12, I watched Matt Ryan lift the Eagles all the way to No. 2 in the country on the gridiron. And when I was 13, I watched Jerry York lead the BC icemen to a national championship.
The Eagles were my team. And subsequently, Boston College was my school. That’s why when Boston University won a hockey title in 2009, I was beside myself. And why “For Boston” echoed through my house years later when I pulled my first college acceptance out of an envelope from Chestnut Hill.
Nonetheless, this article is being published in The Crimson, not The Heights. And when I got to Harvard, I knew this wasn’t a sports school—a wild notion when you consider about 20 percent of the student body competes in intercollegiate athletics.
But college is what you make of it. I wanted to be at a sports school, so I made Harvard one.
During my freshman year, I managed to get an ear-to-ear smile out of Bobby Orr at the Coop, recreating the ex-Bruin defenseman’s iconic leap in front of the legend himself. Since then, star athletes like Richard Sherman, Andrew Luck, Landon Donovan, Larry Fitzgerald, Arian Foster, and Matt Hasselbeck have all passed through campus—all appetizers for the day I received a noogie inside Sever Hall from my childhood hero, Pedro Martinez.
More memories piled up on the athletic fields themselves, where I spent four years doing my best to pretend my days as an athlete were far from over. Opponents’ bones were broken and brawls were had, as I, alongside my roommates, fought valiantly to bring Dunster a Straus Cup. Alas, the mission came up short, but I’ll take my softball and soccer championships, along with my hatred for Winthrop and Dudley, to the grave.
Last but certainly not least, I’ve made countless memories as a member of The Crimson, having had the opportunity to fulfill a dream of being a sports journalist. Primarily covering the men’s hockey team, I’ve made it to 26 different rinks in 10 different states, I’ve watched my name show up on SportsCenter, and I’ve made some of my best friends along the way. Heck, I’ve even had my own personal Dan Shaughnessy moment in which a member of the hockey team considered a column of mine to be shit spewage—a surefire indication you’ve made it, if you ask me.
Now, I’ve done enough deep dives into The Crimson’s analytics to know no one reads parting shots unless you mention the name Katie Ledecky. But that’s quite alright, for this is simply my platform to reminisce and say so long.
That said, in the off chance a young undergraduate does stumble across this, know that Harvard and sports can in fact coexist. You just need to make it happen.
So what are you waiting for? Comp Crimson Sports or track down your heroes. Or please, at the very least, kick some Winthrop ass.

“Mental toughness wins championships.” That’s a controversial statement that some take to the grave and others fling aside.
But for Harvard women’s squash, the sentiment has grown past clique into a manner of life, manifesting itself in the team’s performance and guiding the top-ranked squad (15-0, 7-0 Ivy League) to a third-straight College Squash Association national championship.
This success stems from continuity. The first time that players assemble in the fall, they are one step ahead. The Crimson’s legacy of success—its latest triumph captured the honor of most collegiate titles (17)—attracts world-class players whose technical skill allows for more strategic-based play.
In 2016, a year after No. 8 world-ranked pro Amanda Sobhy graduated, two freshmen took over the program’s top seeds. Sabrina Sobhy, the younger sister of Amanda, and fellow U.S. National Team member Kayley Leonard led Harvard to a repeat title.
This past year, the Crimson looked across the pond to recruit top British nationals Gina Kennedy and Amelia Henley. Next season, the program will welcome Hannah Craig, an Irish national champion.
This blessing of talent allows Coach Mike Way to focus on pragmatic training that will help the team win as a cohesive unit, rather than practicing fundamentals. The team and its coaching staff has pushed aside conventional thinking regarding training, with an emphasis on working smarter, not harder.
“It is not about just drilling endlessly and repeating drills and then assuming, on the day of battle, under stress, under the spotlight, that those drills will unfold how you’ve seen them unfold in practice,” Way said. “Under stress, you cannot ignore the mental component.”
The coaching staff has instituted a regimented mental toughness program with a focus on maintaining an “optimum mental energy level,” allowing the athletes to play well despite stressful situations.
“With anyone under stress, whether it’s public speaking or a music recital, or especially maybe in sport competitions, there’s a certain amount of cause of stress built up and the mind starts to race,” Way said. “The thinking starts to be repetitive, and it can become emotional. And, in fact, for the most part it is involuntary thinking.”
The squash players train to maintain their “arousal”—a state dependent on psychological processes such as confidence and automaticity—at an optimum level that allows for highest athletic performance.
“The word ‘optimum’ will change from person to person,” Way said. “Not every athlete’s will be the same. But in my experience, in an individual sport, there are more athletes that have to come down to their optimum than to be higher.”
While skill can, in some instances, substitute for regular practice, there is no way for athletes to manage arousal levels without constant exposure to stress. In squash practices, Harvard players waged challenge matches that both pragmatically determine match seeding and force players to face adversity.
A mental training program focusing on visualization of the match and gratitude supplemented this stress-inducing training. Way calls this additional program “scripting.”
“You know, we are chasing a black ball around a white room. We are not solving world hunger,” Way said. “If you bring in gratitude—gratitude for what got them to Harvard, their family, et cetera—you lower the energy level.”
Although Coach Way has long emphasized the importance of the mental aspect—perhaps a large reason why women’s squash has won the national championship five of seven years during his tenure—the inclusion of scripting increased the effectiveness of the regimen.
Visualization allows players to internalize successful practices and adopt a feeling of gratitude that optimizes mental energy levels and enhances performance.
Not only have coaches and players acknowledged the success of this new programming, but also the results from the court back up its effectiveness. Harvard never dropped more than two matches against another team and completed ten sweeps.
Moreover, in several individual matches, players overcame adverse circumstances. Leonard rallied from five match points down in the national championship final against No. 2 Penn to spur the Crimson. In the national individual championship, Kennedy unexpectedly found herself against two-time national finalist and Penn sophomore Reeham Sedky, but the Harvard rookie calmly disarmed “The Hammer.”
These performances signal the power of Way’s mental training program. But the team’s excellence throughout the season also bears witness to the close-knit nature of the group.
“We are leaving with a team that is more cohesive as a unit, as best friends, but also as a team that has just absolutely excelled in every sense of the term this year,” co-captain Dileas MacGowan said. “I think that we are leaving with the strongest team that Harvard women’s squash has ever experienced.”

It’s rare to find an athlete who is versatile enough to play multiple positions on the field equally well. It’s also rare for an international student-athlete to arrive and immediately make a huge impact on team that’s having a historically successful season.
In freshman forward Bente van Vlijmen, you find both qualities.
As the Ivy League Rookie of the Year with eight goals and 16 points under belt, van Vlijmen wasted no time getting down to business when she flew across the pond to join Harvard. No Crimson player had won that individual honor since 2002. Van Vlijmen earned the award unanimously.
“Bente has been fantastic,” coach Tjerk van Herwaarden said. “One thing that I really like from Bente is that she is able to make the whole entire team play with more intensity and higher energy. She doesn’t shy back when she needs to step up when you need her most…. If you want to be successful as a team, you really need an athlete like that on your side.”
Time and time again, van Vlijmen delivered in key conference games. Her first college scores came in a 2-0 victory over rivals Yale a few weeks into the start of the season. It took van Vlijmen only 31 seconds to find the back of the Bulldogs’ net. She wove the ball through the Yale defense and finished with a backhand slice. Twenty-six minutes, she proceeded to do it all over again with a successful penalty corner play.
Other highlights of van Vlijmen’s short yet fruitful Harvard career include her lone goal in a 1-0 win over competitors Boston University and her first career hat trick against Dartmouth during the program’s final moments campaigning for the Ivy League Championship.
On the Crimson’s roster, only senior Marissa Balleza tallied more scores. And the rookie posted a Harvard-best shooting percentage of .195 for all players with more than one goal.
Alongside her personal achievements, van Vlijmen has participated in one of the most successful seasons in program history. The Crimson garnered historic wins over Penn and Princeton and most importantly, recaptured the Ivy League Championship for the first time since 2004.
“Personally, I tried to focus on positively stimulating others since we needed confidence to capitalize on our team’s talent,” van Vlijmen said. “I think that everyone did a great job supporting each other, and that is why the team started breaking record after record. Every individual player on the team has had a huge impact on this season, each in different ways.”
However, it is not only the front line where van Vlijmen has showed her athleticism. When a fellow teammate had to reduce playing time because of an injury, van Vlijmen made a smooth transition. She moved from center forward and center back, proving to be an invaluable player on both the offensive and defensive end.
“She’s just an incredible force,” senior forward Clare McClintock said. “Bene is probably the strongest field hockey player I’ve ever seen. Anytime we’ve needed a goal, you just throw her up the front line. I’ve never played anyone who’s that phenomenal.”
With one-third of the team graduating in the senior class, van Vlijmen and the new incoming freshmen have big shoes to fill. But she has consistently proved that youth and status as a freshman have no indicator on the power and impact an athlete can have on the field.
“[The seniors] will be missed incredibly, and it’s absolutely impossible to fill their shoes,” van Vlijmen said. “However, I’m convinced that Harvard Field Hockey is going to be very strong in the coming years. I think the fact that I’ve been chosen [for Rookie of the Year] shows the enormous steps we’ve taken as a team and the extent we’ve shocked others with our improvements and victories. I can’t wait to see what the future holds for us.”
