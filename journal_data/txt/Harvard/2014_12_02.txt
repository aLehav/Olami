After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
1. The Grand Budapest Hotel
“The Grand Budapest Hotel” is the movie to watch if you want your yearly allowance of twee in one whimsical go. Set against the backdrop of a 20th-century resort overtaken by a Naziesque occupying army, the film sees Wes Anderson reprise many of his old standbys: meticulously symmetrical shots, sans serif fonts, deadpan humor, and the shimmering creature known to us mere earthlings as Tilda Swinton. While not Anderson’s best work—his candy-colored treatment of fascism ultimately strikes this critic as inappropriate—the film is, in keeping with the rest of his œuvre, a dazzlingly beautiful, meticulously rendered work of art. —Erica X Eisen
2. Boyhood
If you were born in the ’90s, the opening minutes of “Boyhood,” appropriately tracked to Coldplay's Y2K anthem “Yellow,” might feel oddly reminiscent of the childhood home videos your parents insist that you watch with them when you're back for the holidays. Director Richard Linklater's novel approach to long-term filmmaking garnered him rave reviews from every corner of the field of film criticism, but the universal acclaim of “Boyhood” is rooted in something more than pure technical appreciation. For the critics who grew into the soul-searching, free-spirited artiste-hood of protagonist Mason, played by the philosophical and prematurely bearded Ellar Coltrane, “Boyhood” isn't just a film. It's a reflection—and a revelation. —Victoria Lin
3. Guardians of the Galaxy
If you thought Marvel was on the decline after the not terrible but stale "Thor" and "Captain America" sequels, let “Guardians of the Galaxy” serve as a beacon of hope that the studio is still taking chances. After all, what other summer blockbuster has cast Vin Diesel as a talking tree who can only say one hilarious sentence? What other film has invested in Chris Pratt as a bona fide live-action leading man? “Guardians of the Galaxy” succeeds thanks to a planet-sized pile of faux-”Star Wars” space operatics and plain old slapstick comedy, but beware: this writer has had Blue Suede’s 1974 version of “Hooked on a Feeling” stuck in his head since August (not necessarily a bad thing). —Tree A. Palmedo
4. Gone Girl
David Fincher glories in crafting detestable characters: on removing that key source of audience engagement in his films and drawing the viewer in anyhow. The various twists and turns of “Gone Girl” do nothing to engender sympathetic characters, even when they absolve someone of potential guilt. But despite how little the viewer may care for the protagonists’ happiness, “Gone Girl” is still the quintessential edge-of-your-seat, armrests-gripped thriller, the sort of film whose two and a half hours pass in a blur of needing to know just what will happen next. —Grace E. Huckins
5. The Lego Movie
As Hollywood capitalizes on classic childhood toys, rarely does it produce a meaningful work (remember “Battleship”?). At most, the attempts are enjoyable for their hilariously terrible production or sentimental value. But the evocation of nostalgia is not the only reason why “The Lego Movie” is a gem. The animation is colorful and vivid, and the voice actors masterfully encapsulate their roles: Chris Pratt gives hero Emmett suitable enthusiasm, and Will Arnett captures Batman down to the growl. And though the story is predictable, its themes add a heartfelt dimension to an already technically impressive work. The result is a smart, sassy product that will encourage other films to transcend cliché animated tropes. —Ha D.H. Le
6. Dear White People
After making its award-winning debut at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival, “Dear White People” has been extremely well received by audiences and critics alike, scoring an impressive 91 percent from critics on Rotten Tomatoes. This film chronicles the struggles faced both personally and collectively by the black student body at a fictional Ivy League college, addressing issues from the structural racism that affects the college admissions process to the challenges of interracial dating. Writer and director Justin Simien uses his medium to expertly mock and debunk black stereotypes, creating a dynamic and compelling cast of characters. —Abby L. Noyes
6. The Fault in Our Stars
On June 6, John Green’s teen cancer love story made the transition from the page to the screen. While some criticized the film for sentimentalizing Green’s unflinching portrait of dying high schoolers, praise for the screenplay and for Shailene Woodley’s performance was effusive. In addition to flurries of tissues on movie theater floors, the film precipitated $304 million in ticket sales, a New Yorker article dissecting the cult of John Green, a formidable TFIOS hashtag, and hours upon hours of radio play for Charli XCX’s “Boom Clap.” —Emma R. Adler
8. Interstellar
“Interstellar” is, quite literally, the year’s biggest movie. You can see it in IMAX theaters as well as normal-sized ones. The director is Christopher Nolan of “Inception,” “Memento,” and “The Dark Knight” fame, Hollywood’s own Hamlet with his bad dreams, ruminating male loners, and, in the case of “Interstellar,” truly infinite space. In the future, ex-NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) leaves a dying Earth to find new planets capable of sustaining human life. The script and directing are not always subtle, but superb acting (by a cast including Jessica Chastain and Anne Hathaway) meet with formidable special effects to more than compensate. —Victoria Zhuang
9. Snowpiercer
Listen, if you’re looking for a graphic novel-turned-South Korean popcorn flick with linear one-versus-a-thousand fight scenes and a hilariously inevitable twist ending, you should watch “Oldboy” (not Spike Lee’s steamer, the 2003 original). “Snowpiercer” is okay for second place, though. Chris Evans shows off all the versatility that landed him the role of Johnny Storm, Tilda Swinton is weirdly convincing as a live-action “Wallace and Gromit” villain, and the Marxism isn’t too stifling. Lingering question: why a movie, and not “BioShock 4”? —Will Holub-Moorman
9. X-Men: Days of Future Past
Boasting an incredible ensemble cast that combines characters from “X-Men: First Class” and the original “X-Men” trilogy, “Days of Future Past” is undeniably the best superhero film of the past several years. Wolverine’s mind is sent back to the 1970s to prevent an apocalyptic mutant genocide, and he must collaborate with the hotheaded younger versions of Professor X (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) while their older selves (Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen) protect his body in the present. Notably, “Days of Future Past” acts as an unexpected retcon to the critically panned “X-Men 3” and sets the stage for a highly anticipated sequel featuring the supervillain Apocalypse. —Alan R. Xie

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dear readers,
We’re happy to present the Arts Year in Review issue of 2014: continuing a practice started by last year’s Arts Chairs, we used the results of a campus-wide survey to rank the year’s best movies, music, books, theater productions, and more. Turn to page 3 to see our takes on the highest-ranked movies and albums; turn to page 8 to see the general breakdown.
The mission of the arts board has always been to train our writers, inform our community, and offer cultural commentary on the creative projects of our time: we’ve always felt thankful to have the opportunity to both report and critique. We’d like to think we succeeded in those goals this year, as a vast number of well-written, well-researched, and eloquent pieces have gone through us, and we’ve proudly watched our contributing writers and staff members become experienced and confident journalists. Our online content has become both more consistent and more sophisticated, and our print magazine remains both aesthetically appealing and easy to read. We’re particularly happy with some of our cover stories, especially those on the reopening of the Harvard Art Museums, Boston public art, and data visualization.
As our tenure as Arts Chairs comes to an end, we’d like to take the chance to thank all of our execs, writers, and compers for working hard all year; our designers and photographer for helping us present our content in the best way possible; and the Managing Editor and President for working with us to ensure the quality of our publication. We’d also like to congratulate Abby L. Noyes ’16 and Grace E. Huckins ’16, next year’s chairs. We’re sad that our terms are ending, but we know we’re leaving the arts board in good hands.
And of course, we’d like to thank you, the readers, for your ongoing interest in our features, reviews, columns, and more: we’re proud to have written, edited, and directed this publication for you. We hope we have, at the least, encouraged you to engage critically with the subject to which we return: art.
With gratitude and relief,
Natalie T. Chang and Erica X Eisen

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
1. "1989," Taylor Swift 
She’s no longer the girl next door—Taylor Swift’s glossy, Max Martin-produced “1989” finally departs from country for a mainstream pop aesthetic. Gone are the lengthier anthems “Speak Now” and “Fearless,” as Swift tightly packs hook after hook in an album of radio-friendly melodies. Although Swift’s individual style has trouble standing out—“New Romantics” sounds like Passion Pit, “Wildest Dreams” channels Lana Del Rey, and the tongue-in-cheek single “Blank Space” is every mid-2000s R&B song given the Lorde treatment—her songwriting prowess remains undeniable. Through combined strength of brand image and genuine talent, Swift demonstrates exactly why “1989” has managed to sell over a million physical copies in the age of streaming. —Alan R. Xie
2. "x," Ed Sheeran
In an age of synthesizers and overproduced, bass-heavy radio singles, English singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran brings back the acoustic ballad in his sophomore album “x.” Standout tracks like “I’m a Mess,” “Bloodstream,” and “Afire Love” showcase the unabashed sentimentality and idiosyncrasy of Sheeran’s songwriting, along with his ability to build a quiet acoustic track towards a grand climax with an innovative and skillful use of the loop pedal. Meanwhile, the album’s overt funk influences—noticeable in singles “Sing” and “Don’t”—demonstrate Sheeran’s musical range as he balances catchy hooks with fast and clever rhymes. —Alan R. Xie
3. “In The Lonely Hour,” Sam Smith
While critics panned the safe orchestration and cliché lyrics of Sam Smith’s debut “In The Lonely Hour,” Smith’s deft voice overshadows any deficiencies. The British singer displays a versatile register, effortlessly sculpting his voice to match each song’s theme. “Lay Me Down,” a track about yearning for a futile love, reflects this: while Smith begins in crooning speak-sing that muted piano chords sporadically echo, he soon bursts into roaring proclamations—a testament to his voice’s power as an instrument. And while Smith’s melancholic subject matter is an interesting study in and of itself, it is his vocal prowess that ultimately smooths out the album. —Ha D. H. Le
4. “Ultraviolence,” Lana del Rey
Lana del Rey is the incarnation of the Great American Pop Star, and hating her is tantamount to hating Jackie Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe, and Judy Garland all at the same time. Your feelings about her depend entirely on this. Her second album, “Ultraviolence,” presents a more coherent sound than that of her 2012 breakout, “Born to Die,” winning over many critics who received “Born to Die” coolly. This increased coherence and standout songs—including “Shades of Cool” and the almost sentimentally tender “Old Money”—make “Ultraviolence” one of the most compelling pop albums this year. Lana is still the pop girl to watch over the next few years. —Jude D. Russo
5. "This Is All Yours," alt-J
Bands that become wildly successful right away often struggle to live up to expectations with their later efforts; alt-J’s sophomore album, “This Is All Yours,” avoids that problem by building on the aesthetic of 2012’s “An Awesome Wave.” From the first Whac-A-Mole-reminiscent chords of the opening track (appropriately entitled “Intro”), it’s clear that the Leeds-based band does not intend to fix anything that ain’t broke. The album wanders through a progression of melancholy synths and echoing vocals; the end result comes out as something you might play to a sleepy person on mescaline. Standout tracks include “Nara,” “Garden of England,” and “Choice Kingdom.” —Lien E. Le
5. "Turn Blue," The Black Keys
The Black Keys, Grammy-winning purveyors of radio-friendly stadium rock, return with a record that lightens up on the crowd-pleasing and pushes the envelope more than the Akron, Ohio duo have done in years. Opener "Weight of Love" is a seven-minute exercise in ambience and bass guitar that feels like the Keys' most genuine effort so far at sonic originality, and closer “Gotta Get Away” leaves something for fans of classic Keys as the album’s sole unabashed foot-stomper. The unending deluge of blues guitar-over-synth can, at times, overwhelm, but the prospect of The Black Keys daring for once to explore their own boundaries redeems an album with just enough atmospheric, funk-infused experimentation to set it apart from the genre as a whole. —Victoria Lin
7. "G I R L," Pharrell Williams
While the ebullient and light "Happy" may be the foundational song on Pharrell Williams's comeback album "G I R L," the artist crafted the concept LP as a serious rebuff to those who criticized his musical treatment of women after his participation in Robin Thicke's controversial "Blurred Lines." The exhilarating pastiche of soul, funk, and R&B presents females as equal participants in love—Miley Cyrus's gruff background vocals save even "Come Get It Bae," the most sexually aggressive track on "G I R L," from the machismo of the Thicke-verse. In "Marilyn Monroe," Pharrell sings of a tender relationship that eschews ego and braggadocio. The song also has an extended Hans Zimmer-composed string intro, just one of many triumphant production and thematic risks from the resurgent star. —David J. Kurlander
8. "St. Vincent," St. Vincent
Let it be known that in 2014, Annie Clark officially became a rock goddess (she shared the stage with Nirvana twice, for crying out loud). Gone are the twee trappings and Sufjan Stevens influences of old; in their place are a wild mane of silver hair and a dense mix of glitched-out dance jams and roaring guitar solos. “St. Vincent” is Clark at her most eclectic—and also her most fun—and if the album paints her in a colder light than records past, Clark remains vulnerable enough behind the space-odyssey synths and robotic beats to remind you why you fell in love with St. Vincent in the first place. —Tree A. Palmedo
9. "LP1," FKA twigs
She had us at “I can fuck you better than her.” FKA twigs shook the walls and came on strong with first single “Two Weeks,” sweetly warning us that she “could rip it open.” And then that’s what she did with “LP1,” an iconoclastic debut album that takes a baseball bat to the lavish electronics of contemporary R&B and then has makeup sex in the rubble. Through its 10 tracks, she shatters expectations about what a female artist can sound like and sing about, and the awe-inspiring music videos and live performances that have followed suggest that she’s just getting started with us. —Matthew J. Watson
10. “Morning Phase,” Beck
Beck, loser-hero of the late ’90s and early ’00s, has gotten old, and his sound has gotten more mature too. Ethereal arrangements make for cogent, unaccustomedly cheerful content on his latest album, “Morning Phase.” Beck has billed this as the “companion piece” to “Sea Change,” emphasizing the album’s day-and-night contrast with the gloomy 2002 masterpiece. Beck’s usual acoustic bias is transformed into a lush, hypnotic orchestral landscape, with rhythmic tracks like “Morning,” “Blackbird Chain,” and “Waking Light.” —Jude D. Russo
10. "Salad Days," Mac DeMarco
“Salad Days” is an album of contradictions. Put together after a series of concerts (which DeMarco calls “raunchfests”), the tracks were recorded in the intimacy of his bedroom apartment. Despite its title, the album was born out of feelings of exhaustion and old age. And the ever-unfazed DeMarco, in all of his gap-toothed glory, appears more genuine than he’s ever been over the course of his two-moniker, three-album career. It’s a little disorienting to see one of indie rock’s most outlandish figures release an album that’s so simple in its yearning, so bare in its delivery. “Salad Days” features an astonishingly direct DeMarco, who transforms his trademark abandon into sincere vulnerability. —Brian B. Kim

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s Friday night of Harvard-Yale weekend. “Blank Space” is blaring, Rubinoff is flowing faster than torrential rain, and students are a drunken sea of blue and crimson. After a while, my Yalie high-school best friend and I decide to head back home, until his ex-hook-up-friends-with-benefits-maybe-boyfriend texts him to come over. We head over (against my advice), and my friend succumbs to his ex-whatever’s allures. Sitting alone in the common room, I chug away at my gin until a random Yalie walks in and disaster strikes.


The guy—let’s call him Matt—asks what my “major” is. This is apparently how Yalies start a conversation. Nice to meet you too, my name is Adela. I tell him that I’m an art history concentrator. I see him give me a once-over, and I know what he sees: my thick black frame glasses, eyelashes coated with black mascara, and lips smeared with red lipstick. He asks condescendingly, “So you like pretty things?”
Yes. I’m an art historian because I like to look at pretty, colorful things. In fact, my focus field, Modern Art, is just abstract bursts of color shining like a rainbow. So, Matt, here are the top five prettiest modern works. I’m sorry I left before giving you the list.
Marcel Duchamp’s “Fountain”
Ooh, look at how smooth and white the urinal’s porcelain is. It’s so sensuous, and I think the upright position of the urinal resembles a uterus. Come to think of it, I kind of want to pee in that thing, but I can’t because of the stupid guards hovering around me. I wonder if that Mutt guy ever peed in it.
Pablo Picasso’s “Les Demoiselles d’Avignon”
So naked. Many pinkness. Wow. I love naked brothel scenes; I can just imagine myself having sex with these figures—especially the croucher on the right corner. Though, I have to say, her face is kind of scary. I mean, what’s up with the mask? Whatever, sex overcomes everything, right?
Kazimir Malevich’s “Suprematist Composition: White on White”
It’s a white square…on a bigger white square? What does it even mean? It’s not even colorful! But I guess its facture is kind of cool—the texture of the paint really comes through. Is that “pure feeling” inside me? Who am I?
Piet Mondrian’s “Victory Boogie-Woogie”
Color, finally! I can feel the syncopating rhythm of blue, red, and yellow with some other boring colors! But why are there tapes coming off this work? That’s stupid—it’s almost as if Piet didn’t want to finish it. How pointless. Like Hegelian dialectics.
Andy Warhol’s “Marilyn Monroe”
Meow, what a sex icon. Look at that blond hair and blue eyeshadow. I can consume her via the countless images of her. Commodity fetishism has finally trickled down to art, thank goodness. I wonder if this will look good in my flat in the East Village.

As the outgoing Covers Executive, I consider myself something of an authority on covers of all shapes and sizes. Here is my definitive ranking of covers.
Bedding is confusing. There are, in fact, many different kinds of covers that go into a complete set of bedding. For example, blankets and top sheets can also be considered covers. But due to their superior pillowiness and softness, duvet covers are undoubtedly the best.
An alias is a name you adopt when you go undercover; sometimes, it is referred to as a cover. This kind of cover is important if you are a superhero or a teen idol and need to live a double life. It is also important if you witnessed something that you probably shouldn’t have witnessed.
Temps are people who can cover your job for you if you are having a baby or are otherwise incapacitated. They often don’t make very much money and are just doing it for the experience. The hardworking temp is an essential cog in the machinery of the average workplace, and for this we salute them.
Maybe she’s born with it? It’s much more likely that she is wearing cover-up. Cover-up is what people (usually women) wear to disguise blemishes on their faces. Not to be confused with foundation, which is like cover-up for your entire face!
This is something you wear to the beach to protect your modesty. It is often pastel in color and very flowy, making it the optimal thing to be wearing when walking on the sand while the wind is blowing. If you are desperate, a towel can function as a cover up.
These are really fun! This is when one artist decides to make a version of a song previously recorded by another artist. I especially like it when they only use a little bit of the song they’re covering, like in “Anaconda.” Those are sort of mini-covers–coverlets??
When someone is your understudy, they’re also called your cover. If, for some reason (an ailment, a physical injury, a bad case of the Wednesdays), you are unable to perform, they will take your place and do their best to fill your (character!) shoes. We owe a lot to these people.
These are thorough, interesting, and generally fun pieces written by Crimson Arts writers, and they are coming to a newsstand and an Internet near you. READ THEM ALWAYS. Especially when they are edited by incoming Covers Executive Adela H. Kim, which they will be next year. What luck!!

Your head spins with fragmented scenes from the film. Your ribs feel like caving in. Your heart feels like a paper crane. It is 9:30 p.m., it is raining, and you have no umbrella.

Film pitch: So there’s this guy. And he’s this cool, popular dude in a frat and on the school paper, so everybody likes him, you know? But he’s just so soft inside. I mean, just emotionally, he’s always one one-night stand away from breaking. But then he meets this guy, this guy named Jude, and they just connect, you know? It’s confusing at first for them both because they’re just so different. Jude’s this strong, tough—just really resilient in every way. Just the complete opposite of this frat bro. It’s a story about unexpected friendship, intangible lust, and a quadruple homicide. Starring Jonah Hill and Seth Rogen.
Most commonly felt emotion: Regret

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I'm turning 20 tomorrow, and I'm not chill with it. No longer being teenaged feels like a physiological acceptance of middle age, which may explain why I listened to Paul Simon's "Graceland" and sipped on stiff Manhattans every night over break in the newest installment of inevitable existential crises and alcohol abuse that have accompanied my last few birthdays.
Songs make middle age more tragically romantic (or romantically tragic) than films or books can. In movies you have to see the graying hair and undulating jowls and inexplicably moist eyes of age. In books you fill in all of the sensory details of mid-life angst, which leads to aggressively macabre renderings. With music, you're given the gravelly sound of squareness—it's subtle enough to stop direct confrontations with mortality but tangible enough to avoid your own sick vision. Before I’m off to rolling golf courses and 4 p.m. dinners of Boca, here are lyrics from the Crimson Arts Music Vault by middle-aged artists that explain what 20 (40) feels like.
"A man walks down the street
He says why am I soft in the middle now.”
("You Can Call Me Al" Paul Simon, from "Graceland," 1986)
Damn it, Paul Simon, for capturing in lyric exactly what I feel today. The creative lifeblood behind 1960s folk-rock duo Simon & Garfunkel lays down a brutally honest interior monologue about the creeping self-consciousness that accompanies middle age. Simon’s verse screams, "I'm here, I'm in my forties, and I want to be heard." Yesterday, as I stuffed a second gyro into my mouth and thought about how I may never work out again, I couldn't help but praise Simon for being a truth-teller.
“She said don't I know you
From the cinematographer's party
I said who am I 
To blow against the wind?"
("I Know What I Know" Paul Simon, from "Graceland," 1986)
The coupling of South African melodies with iconic songwriter Paul Simon's neurotic wit makes "I Know What I Know" the most arresting conception of middle age ever put to record. Who doesn't know the feelings of blasé flirtation between ostensibly "mature" artistes? Even if Simon's lack of credit towards the African musicians who helped with "Graceland" makes his usurpation of foreign melodies more of a Lester Burnhamian search for meaning than activism, the jarring juxtaposition is still a musical parallel to the confusion of middle-aged dating. Yesterday, when I decided on a second gyro over "meeting women" with my "friends," I couldn't help but empathize with Simon's shoulder-shrug.
"Fat Charlie, the Archangel, sloped into the room
He said, ‘I have no opinion about this
And I have no opinion about that.’"
("Crazy Love, Vol. II" Paul Simon, from "Graceland," 1986)
I have no opinion about this.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Have you ever wanted to sound like the pretentious critic from “All About Eve”? Have you ever wanted to alienate significant numbers of people? Are you the sort of person who flatters yourself into thinking that significant numbers of people read your writing? If you answered yes to any of these questions, this is the guide for you! Use it to annoy your enemies and also to annoy your friends!
STEP 1: LYRICAL INTRODUCTION
To write a proper JDR review, you have to start out on the right foot. The introduction sets the tone for the whole piece. To get in the proper spirit of the thing, spend an hour or two staring at a photograph of A. E. Housman. Once you have done this, start your introduction. There are three acceptable ways to frame the introduction:
If you are writing a “master-level” JDR review, your first sentence should start with a subordinate clause. Extra points for starting with a quote with a subordinate clause.
STEP 2: HAVE AN OPINION
You are an opinionated person, and conveying your opinion is at least notionally why you are writing this review. However, for it to be a proper JDR review, you must have the right sort of opinion.
Acceptable opinions:
There are no acceptable positive opinions, unless it actually made you cry, in which case you may not actually be able to write the review.
STEP 3: FEEL BAD
About all mean the things you just said. Your mother would be ashamed.
STEP 4: TRY TO SAY SOMETHING NICE
This is usually only feasible if the thing you’re having an opinion about failed or was terrible. If it was an offense to Art, you might be scraping the bottom.**
STEP 5: TALK ABOUT BLOCKING
If you are the sort of person who writes this sort of review, you probably obsess over blocking. You will talk about blocking even if you’re not writing a theater review. Just accept it.
STEP 6: WRITE A CONCLUSION
While your opinions go on forever, the review can’t. The conclusion should be hasty, stilted, and short. If you can jam in a quote from Cicero, pat yourself on the back and take a shot for Art.***
STEP 7: ENJOY
You’re now a terrible, terrible person that nobody likes. Good job!
*A FUN GAME FOR YOU TO PLAY: While reading a JDR review, take a shot every time you see an appeal to Art!
**You should be at two shots by now!
***Take two shots here because of how much self-referentiality annoys you.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This fall, in the midst of my coursework, social stresses, and PAFing duties, I suddenly realized the irony of my situation: I’m a Peer Advising Fellow who desperately needs advising himself. So far, my sophomore year is turning out to be much more difficult than the dreaded freshman year.
Why?
Sophomore fall is the semester when, whether you’re ready or not, you have to make significant academic, social, and emotional decisions that have profound implications for the rest of your time at Harvard. And with PAFs out of the picture, and sophomore advisors who don’t necessarily attend Harvard or share your interests in the first place, the going gets tough.
First, your concentration. Guidance on concentration choice is one of the more egregious failures of sophomore advising. If you didn’t find the “advising fortnight” particularly helpful during your freshman spring, then you are almost completely dependent on either upperclassman advice or guidance from a sophomore advisor who, again, may or may not share your academic interests or have the appropriate knowledge to help you.
Seeking out advice from the departments themselves is a remarkable challenge in and of itself. My experiences trying to track down non-resident tutors and concentration advisors involved endless redirection to different people who each swore that someone else was responsible for assisting me.
Sophomores confront a similar lack of support when it comes to House life. The ruling philosophy about how to transition sophomores into the twelve Houses goes something like this: If we throw sophomores into these House communities and treat them like juniors and seniors, then by the time they get to junior or senior year they’ll probably have it figured it out.
And entryways don’t help. They are, in my experience, mostly a joke. Study breaks and other entryway gatherings have, for me, been non-existent. I personally couldn’t tell you the name of anyone in my entryway besides my blockmates, and that is not a result of poor study break attendance. It is the nature of how Houses treat sophomores: Sink or swim.
There are also some crucial and transformative social and emotional challenges that arise sophomore fall. Chief among them is the infamous punch process. Even if you decide to forego joining one of Harvard’s final clubs, you will still experience their spillover effects. Every sophomore invariably knows someone punching. More likely, as was my case, you know many people participating in the process—including close friends.
This punch process, I think, is one of the most significant examples of the hard questions sophomores have to answer: How do we reconcile some of our selfish desires to join an elite, exclusive community with our feeling that final clubs do not promote a positive and inclusive social atmosphere on campus? What are the values that justify joining final clubs and do these values align with our own?
If you decide to abstain from the punch process, then how do you understand and accept the opposite decision from the people you thought had values similar to your own? On a less philosophical level, how do you deal with the fact that you may no longer see close friends who are punching all that much, since the process is such a time-sink?
And punch isn’t the only difficult social decision sophomores must make. With whom do you decide to remain close even after punch season? How do you see old friends when you are no longer next to them in the Yard? Which clubs do you stick with, and which do you ditch? The list goes on.
You’re asked in your sophomore fall to do a whole lot of deciding without a whole lot of support. The endless procession of sophomore fall decisions all seem to need resolution just when the proverbial rug of support has been pulled out from under us.
I’m not foolish or naive enough to believe that all of these problems would be solved if the college offered more support; some of these are struggles that we need to solve on our own. Will better advising make our punch decisions for us? Probably not.
I do think, however, that the lack of support offered to sophomores is symbolic of a more systemic issue at the college: a tendency to be distant, insensitive, and deeply unresponsive to the needs of students. The idea that Harvard students are smart and resourceful enough to get into Harvard, and so they must be smart enough to figure it out on their own, seems to pervade the college at many levels. Why does a prestigious college like ours lack the kind of support systems that most of our peer institutions take for granted? How is it that Harvard’s support vacuum has persisted for so many generations of students?
There is no easy solution to the pervasive feeling of anomie that accompanies sophomore fall. But the semester is an obvious illustration of the sorry state of support infrastructure here, and that’s something Harvard can and should strive to fix.

Phillips Brooks is a name well known to all Harvard students. Lesser known, however, is the fact that Phillips Brooks wrote my favorite Christmas carol, O Little Town of Bethlehem—a carol which turns out to be surprisingly profound.
Brooks spent Christmas Eve, 1865, in the town of Bethlehem itself. He was deeply moved by the old town, and the memory of that night remained with him. In a letter dated Feb. 19, 1866, Brooks wrote: “I remember especially on Christmas Eve, when I was standing in the old church at Bethlehem, close to the spot where Jesus was born, when the whole church was ringing hour after hour with the splendid hymns of praise to God, how again and again it seemed as if I could hear voices that I knew well, telling each other of the 'Wonderful Night' of the Saviour's birth, as I heard them a year before; and I assure you I was glad to shut my ears for a while and listen to the more familiar strains that came wandering to me halfway round the world.”
A few years later, he penned “O Little Town of Bethlehem.”
The subtlety of the carol is too seldom recognized. The greatest problem is that the fourth verse is usually omitted. This is a great pity, since it is the fourth verse that most uniquely reflects the character of Phillips Brooks himself, the Phillips Brooks whose great practical compassion we remember in the name of the Phillips Brooks House Association. Here is the missing verse:
Where children pure and happy    Pray to the blessed Child,Where misery cries out to Thee,    Son of the Mother mild;Where Charity stands watching    And Faith holds wide the door,The dark night wakes, the glory breaks,    And Christmas comes once more.
In a single verse, Brooks has brilliantly captured the unity of three often disparate strands of Christmas tradition: symbolism, story, and spirit.
We are all familiar with the glorious symbolism of Christmas: the nativity scenes, the star, the shepherds and angels, the mother, the child.
Perhaps we are also familiar with the story of Christmas, the complex historical narratives surrounding the man Jesus of Nazareth, beginning with his birth, ending with his death, detailing his historical life in the gritty non-airbrushed realities of first-century Palestine. This too is remembered in the Christmas season.
And finally, many of us feel the spirit of Christmas. Certainly there’s something of the comforting family hearth in it, but deeper than that, there’s a sense of joy, a desire for peace, a hope for a better world. Deeper, deeper, there is a resolute practicality in that spirit of giving, quite apart from the petty consumerist nonsense. One frequently hears encouraging stories around Christmastime of people serving complete strangers, out of the curious conviction that we are not complete strangers to one another, or that our estrangement is truly the superficial and passing thing. That conviction is caritas, the mighty, living, powerful, practical, infinite tide of servant-like love, selfless charity, unafraid to look the unclean things of the world in the eye and thus, in gentleness, begin to make them clean. Christmas contains a call to respond, a call to serve, a call to arms.
“O Little Town of Bethlehem” communicates the unity of the symbolism, spirit, and story of Christmas. Cynics might see only the symbolism of Christmas, without having grasped the story (which is rather more than just a conglomeration of kitschy images) nor the spirit (which has rather more substance to it than the commercials let on). Humanists might be less cynical of the Christmas spirit, perhaps genuinely celebrating and rejoicing in the values that Christmas represents, but may not see the relevance of the symbolism or the story behind it. If only we could truly unite the ancient and modern stories of Christmas!
Into the fray enters “O Little Town of Bethlehem,” simultaneously gentle and yet game-changing, just like the entrance of the Christ-child. As the third verse has it:
How silently, how silently,    The wondrous gift is given;So God imparts to human hearts    The blessings of His Heaven.No ear may hear His coming,    But in this world of sin,Where meek souls will receive Him still,    The dear Christ enters in.
Christmas is endlessly relevant to us because it is emblematic of the way God enters this world: gentle and yet game-changing, the transcendent God fully present in the unassuming vesture of the infant. As G.K. Chesterton puts it in The Everlasting Man, “It is no more inevitable to connect God with an infant than to connect gravitation with a kitten,” and in another place captures the paradox: “the hands that had made the sun and stars were too small to reach the huge heads of the cattle.” Caritas is always like that. Caritas turns the world upside down.
I close with Phillips Brooks's fifth and final verse.
O holy Child of Bethlehem,    Descend to us, we pray!Cast out our sin and enter in,    Be born in us to-day.We hear the Christmas angels,    The great glad tidings tell;O come to us, abide with us,    Our Lord Emmanuel!
(The G.K. Chesterton passages cited are from The Everlasting Man, Part II, Ch.1, “The God in the Cave.” See also Chesterton’s wonderful poem, “The House of Christmas.”)

This past week, Computer Science 50 instructor David J. Malan ’99 confirmed that Yale will offer a version of Harvard’s renowned introductory computer science class beginning in the fall of 2015. Students at Yale will have the opportunity to watch videos of lectures conducted at Harvard, while sections and office hours will be held in New Haven. Further integration will be achieved by holding joint Puzzle Days and hackathons, and current CS50 TF Jason C. Hirschhorn ’14-’15 will assume a full-time position at Yale to oversee the implementation of the course.
We are glad that Harvard students are afforded access to a class so compelling that it is being exported to another school. That one of Harvard’s peer institutions views CS50 and its cutting-edge pedagogical approach as a desirable alternative to an in-house introductory course should be taken as an affirmation of the University’s progress in undergraduate education. This joint project should serve as a rebuttal to suggestions that Harvard places too little emphasis on quality instruction at the college level. In fact, it is Yale students who may suffer when enrolled in an imported course whose primary teacher will not be present (even if Hirschhorn’s talents may make up for some the loss).
This decision also represents a victory for computer science at Harvard, and for the sciences on campus more generally. Harvard has historically lagged giants in the field such as MIT and Stanford, and to be sure, neither of those schools is importing CS50. But this year, CS50 logged record-breaking enrollment and surpassed N. Gregory Mankiw’s Economics 10 as the most popular course on campus. That, along with the collaboration with Yale, indicates that Harvard has begun to make strides in the field—and a recent gift by Steven A. Ballmer ’77 should propel computer science at the faculty level, too.
This new partnership with Yale also promises to further the mission of Harvard’s edX program to make courses more widely available to those outside the university. This particular project, however, demonstrates that Harvard is capable of offering remote instruction that is on par with courses taught in-person at other prestigious universities. Recently, we have been critical of the exceptional, unique treatment CS50 has received from the Administration in areas like dual enrollment and academic dishonesty. Hopefully, though, this latest move by CS50 will not prove an exception, and will instead reflect broader, ongoing progress. We applaud the strides that Harvard has made both to increase the competitiveness of its science programs and to offer high-quality online courses, and hope that the university’s reputation in these areas will only continue to improve.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 1, 2014, at 9:21 p.m.
Hundreds of Harvard affiliates and Cambridge residents marched on Mass. Ave. and blockaded streets at the heart of Harvard Square early Monday afternoon in protest of a grand jury’s recent decision not to indict a white police officer who shot and killed a black teenager in Ferguson, Mo., this summer.
Students from a number of graduate schools—including the Graduate School of Education, the Kennedy School of Government, and the Divinity School— first joined Law School students shortly after noon outside of Wasserstein Hall to rally together in protest and hear from student and faculty speakers, many of whom had visited Ferguson recently.
Speakers shared personal anecdotes and challenged Harvard students to keep the issue alive through protest. Law School student Victoria I. White-Mason, who recently returned from Ferguson, said that she saw “13-year-olds getting tear-gassed” in the protests.
“Though I saw all those things, I still have hope,” said White-Mason. “I choose hope.”
Between speakers, Law School student Stanford Fraser led protesters in shouting chants like “What do we want? Justice. When do we want it? Now.”
At 1:01 p.m, Law School student Rebecca N. Chapman, one of the protest’s organizers, led the gatherers in a “die-in,” in which protesters laid down silently for 4 and a half minutes. According to Chapman, the duration of the “die-in” was intended to represent the length of time the body of the late Ferguson resident Michael Brown lay in the street before it was taken to a morgue—4.5 hours.
After the “die-in,” protesters walked across the Law School campus to the Science Center Plaza, where they joined with undergraduates and hundreds of students and teachers from nearby Cambridge Rindge and Latin School to walk together onto Mass. Ave.
The mass of protesters blockaded the streets, halting traffic, ultimately coming to a stop by the T stop in the center of the Square.
No arrests were made on the scene and no injuries were reported, according to the Cambridge Police Department. Officers there appeared to permit the protest, marching alongside the protesters as they entered the streets and redirecting oncoming traffic on JFK St. and Mass. Ave. away from the center of the Square for the duration of the rally.
Similar walk-out and “die-in” style protests took place across the country Monday, including at other universities like Yale and Penn. Thousands of people around the country have protested peacefully and, at times, violently since last Monday, when a St. Louis County grand jury decided not to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson for shooting and killing 18-year-old Michael Brown in August.
Near the harvard Sqaure T stop Monday, protesters were joined by Vice Mayor of Cambridge Dennis A. Benzan, who along with  Cambridge Rindge and Latin senior Sydney Fisher addressed the crowd.
“I am only asking for you help in continuing the conversation of race in America...this is not the end,” said Fisher, who led hundreds of her classmates to Harvard Square. “We need to step forward and take responsibility for the future of America.”
Benzan then stood atop a step, quieting chants led by Cambridge Rindge and Latin students to speak to the protesters.
“We are all Americans. Whether you’re white, you’re black, you’re brown, Latino, Asian, Jewish, Christian, or Muslim,” Benzan said. “ You are gathered here today because you want a more perfect union—you want a more perfect America.”
Protesters then joined together in another “die-in,” in the street in front of the Harvard Coop. After several more minutes of chanting, the crowd at Mass. Ave. dissipated shortly before 2 p.m. Protesters from Cambridge Rindge and Latin marched back to their campus through Harvard Yard.
According to Chapman, “seven or eight” students at the Law School began coordinating the Harvard protest last week, invited students from other Harvard schools to join, and reached out to faculty and students to speak at the rally in front of Wasserstein Hall. She said that the group had planned to meet up with Rindge and Latin students after the Wasserstein rally.
“I’m hyped,” said GSE student Ola Abiose, who helped lead the GSE student-walk from Gutman Library to the protest Wasserstein Hall, during the march to Mass. Ave. “I like that we’re all here, showing solidarity.  The more we come out of our own hollow silos and collectively come together, the better.”

Two independent teams of researchers spanning the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, the Medical School, and the Harvard Stem Cell Institute have identified a precancerous state in blood that indicates a higher likelihood that an individual will develop blood cancers, according to their findings published in the New England Journal of Medicine last week.
Benjamin Ebert, an associate professor at the Medical School who led one of the research teams, said both groups studied DNA sequences in blood and focused on somatic mutations, mutations individuals acquire over time as opposed to those they inherit.
“In our study we found that individuals who have had detectable mutations in their blood have about a tenfold increased risk of developing blood cancer later in life,” Ebert said. “What we found is that these mutations in genes that lead to blood cancer are actually quite common. You can detect them in over 10 percent of people over the age of 70.”
While Ebert’s team specifically looked for mutations in genes that had already been linked to blood cancers, the other team, led by Medical School assistant professor Steven A. McCarroll, initially investigated whether somatic mutations contributed to the risk of developing schizophrenia, according to Ebert.
McCarroll said his team studied about 6,000 samples from psychiatric patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and about 6,000 samples from a control group.
“In the end, the mutations that we found were present in both psychiatric patients and controlled [ones],” McCarroll said. “They don’t contribute to schizophrenia, but they definitely contribute to cancer.”
According to Ebert, this research project developed more rapidly than his prior work due to his team’s ability to leverage enormous data sets that had already been developed at the Broad Institute. Ebert said that the Broad Institute had collected blood samples from about 17,000 individuals for the purpose of researching genes that potentially lead to diabetes or cardiovascular disease, which Ebert then reused for his project on blood cancers.
Ebert said that while there is no current intervention to delay or prevent an individual from getting blood cancers, he hopes researchers will be able to develop approaches that can decrease an individual’s likelihood of developing the disease.
“Since people get this when they’re generally older, it may be possible to delay the development of a blood cancer long enough so that it doesn’t develop during the lifetime of an individual,” Ebert said.

After a decade of turmoil and job losses, the mainstream media is rebounding and seizing upon new opportunities opened by the Internet and recent private investment, according to speakers at the annual Theodore H. White Lecture on Press and Politics.
This year’s joint lecturers, Mark E. Halperin ’87 and John Heilemann, spoke at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum on Monday night.
Halperin and Heilemann are the co-authors of "Game Change: Obama and the Clintons, Palin, McCain, and the Race of a Lifetime" and serve as managing editors of Bloomberg Politics.
Heilemann focused his talk on the importance of continued evolution within the media, with a special attention to the role of technology.
“We are now in a period of experimentation,” he said. “The period of destruction...is more in the rearview mirror.”
Heilemann cited Wired, a magazine that reports on the influence of technology on culture, politics, and economics, as an example for all media outlets struggling to adapt with the current pace of technological advancement.
Halperin turned his attention to the future of political campaigns. With an eye on the 2016 elections, he outlined steps that he thinks should be taken to foster a more effective and engaging political climate.
His suggestions to politicians included forgetting flip-flop avoidance, embracing controversial stances they support, and saying what they believe regardless of potential backlash.
“If major candidates take these suggestions on board, and the media gives them credit for it instead of criticism, we’ll have happier candidates, happier voters, and even some happier reporters,” Halperin said.
Before Heilemann and Halperin’s lecture, Alex S. Jones, director of the Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy, gave the David Nyhan Prize for Political Journalism to veteran political reporter David Rogers.
Jones highlighted the special connection that this Rogers had to the late David Nyhan. Not only did Rogers promote the same “relentless journalism” as Nyhan, Jones said, but Rogers also worked with Nyhan at The Boston Globe.
Jones added that while at The Globe, Nyhan and Rogers were known for having a similar disregard for authority that led them to ask the big questions and demand answers from those in power.
“[Roger’s] coverage of Congress has been rooted in a staggering work ethic and a belief that people need to know what happens behind closed doors, what is in legislation,” Jones said.
David Rogers has covered Congress for over 30 years, reporting for The Globe, The Wall Street Journal, and now Politico.

The Rapid Heme Panel, a new gene screening developed by a collaborative team from the Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, may prove a game-changer in cancer treatment, experts say.
The test scans for 95 genes frequently subject to mutations in blood cancers, including leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, and myeloproliferative disorders.
The test, already in use at Dana Farber and Brigham, uses a powerful DNA sequencing technology to assist physicians in a variety of ways. In a medical landscape  where pharmaceutical companies continue to develop drugs that target specific genes and genetic susceptibilities, the Rapid Heme Panel offers doctors a new means to navigate the maze of diagnoses and treatment protocols, according to a press release published in late October by Brigham.
According to a post from the Dana Farber Twitter account earlier in November, the test “provides unprecedented information to aid treatment decisions.”
David P. Steensma, an associate professor at the Medical School and a physician at Dana Farber, praised the development. According to Steensma, the Rapid Heme Panel can help facilitate diagnoses of ambiguous cases. The test can also help a physician plan a course of care management for a patient, as well as identify if a patient is eligible for an experimental treatment protocol that targets specific genes.
“Eventually the goal for leukemia and for all cancers is to match the gene mutation driving the tumor to a narrowly targeted therapy in each individual case, minimizing side effects and maximizing effectiveness,” Steensma wrote in an email to The Crimson.
Steensma added that the new test is faster, less expensive, and less burdensome than the traditional method.
Before the Rapid Heme Panel, blood tests required outside laboratory screening and multiple tests, and the results could take upwards of weeks to return. With the Rapid Heme Panel, results can be received within five business days.
According to Steensma, the Rapid Heme Panel has been used for a few hundred patients, and demand is growing.
Dana Farber and the Brigham are currently the only two sites to offer the test.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Stadium may serve as the home turf for Olympic field hockey if the summer games come to Boston in 2024, according to an Associated Press story published last week.
As the United States Olympic Committee is considering Boston along with three other cities for a potential bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics, Boston 2024 spokesperson Dave Wedge emphasized the role that Harvard and other local universities will have in the planning process if Boston is selected as the host. However, he could not confirm specific plans regarding the use of Harvard facilities in the Olympic Games.
“Boston 2024 is excited about working with all of our university partners, including Harvard, and is eager to continue the conversation should Boston move forward in the Olympic selection process,” Wedge said. “Harvard has some incredible, iconic venues and buildings, but no final decisions have been made with respect to any of the venues for the proposed 2024 Games in Boston.”
Harvard Athletics declined to comment for this story.
The Boston proposal is gaining national media attention for its focus on compactness and affordability based on its efforts to make use of existing infrastructure—including local universities like Harvard—as Olympic venues. The other cities on the USOC short list are Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C.
The Boston 2024 Executive Board Committee currently includes two Harvard affiliates. Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp serves on the College and University Engagement Committee, and Kennedy School lecturer Juliette N. Kayyem ’91 sits on the Innovation and Technology Committee.
Kayyem said that Boston’s plans to include local universities is part of what sets the city apart from its competitors.
“It is a bid that fully integrates all the different pieces that make Boston such an amazing city,” Kayyem said. “Our innovation, our technology, our colleges and universities, our medical health facilities, that is what makes this bid so positive for this city.”
“The subject matter expertise that’s held at Harvard is something that will be utilized throughout the process,” Kayyem added.
Although Boston has never hosted the Olympic Games, the Harvard Stadium has seen its share of Olympic activities over the past century.
For three consecutive Summer Olympics from 1920 and 1928, the Stadium hosted the U.S. Track and Field trials. Six decades later, the Stadium hosted the group stages of the 1984 Olympic soccer matches.
According to the Associated Press article, MIT may host fencing and archery during the games.
The USOC is expected to select their top choice for an American host city in January, and the International Olympic Committee will announce the winning bid in Sept. 2017 at the 130th IOC Session.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Leaders of the Global Health and AIDS Coalition shared stories about HIV/AIDS at their annual vigil on the Memorial Church steps on Monday night in honor of World AIDS Day, aiming to raise awareness about federal funding cuts for treatment.
India Perez-Urbano ’16, one of four speakers at the vigil and the current organizer of GHAC, stressed the importance of advocacy for funding for HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C.
“We want to reignite passion in the global fight against AIDS,” she said to a crowd of over 40 students.
Perez-Urbano noted the scope of the problems facing the AIDS response today.
“A recent study came out that showed that 70 percent of Americans living with HIV/AIDS are unaware of their status,” she said. “Also, the U.S. government has been slashing funding for contributions to AIDS treatment every year since 2010.”
Marguerite Basilico ’11, a current resident tutor in Adams House who headed the GHAC in 2010 and also spoke at the vigil, echoed Perez-Urbano’s sentiments.
In her speech, Basilico explained that, while working at a hospital in Malawi, she met an 21-year-old named George who was HIV-positive.
“George was not afraid. He was full of hope and optimism because there was treatment for him,” she said. “I got back to Harvard with that same sense of optimism, and it was slowly eroded. News came out of Geneva that the Global Fund [to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria] was being crushed for money.”
Monday marked the eighth time Basilico has attended the AIDS vigil on the steps of Memorial Church. As leader of GHAC in 2010, she gained national media attention for the organization by interrupting a live speech by President Obama with calls for increased federal AIDS funding.
“There was that moment after the speech [in 2010] where we said, we can do this, we can raise awareness,” Basilico said on Monday.
Brook K. Baker ’69, a professor at the Northeastern University School of Law and another speaker at the vigil, highlighted the history of AIDS activism at Harvard, which began with a protest outside of the Pfizer headquarters in Boston.
“At that point, Pfizer had an important drug that killed a meningitis strain that was a common killer of people with AIDS which it was selling for many dollars a pill in South Africa,” he said. “Its supporters organized a campaign trying to get Pfizer to sell its medicine for 25 cents a pill instead.”
The vigil ended with a vocal performance of “Lean On Me” by Bri S. Belser ’15 in front of a sea of lit candles on the church steps.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Few players can engineer a second-half comeback. Guys who can do so with an assist, a rebound, a lay-up, a steal, another assist, and another driving finish—contributing to nine straight points that tie the game—are even more rare. And then to fuel two more lead-taking runs after that, refusing to let your team lose?
Well that must just mean we are talking about Wesley Saunders.
Harvard basketball coach Tommy Amaker said before the season that Saunders, a senior guard/forward/whatever you want him to be, had the chance to be one of the Crimson’s best players of all time—maybe the best.
In games against Houston and Massachusetts last week, Saunders continued separating himself from hundreds of Harvard players that have come before him, scoring a combined 51 points in two wins to claim this week’s Athlete of the Week honor.
He started with 24 points against Houston Tuesday. Saunders led the team in scoring for the fourth straight game in that 84-63 victory—the first do so since Jeremy Lin ’10—but none of his points were as crucial as several of his buckets were a few days later.
Sure, Amaker called Saunders’ play “phenomenal” Tuesday, but that game will not be nearly as important come March. So let’s jump ahead to Saturday.
The Crimson played in what felt like enemy territory upon entering Lavietes Pavilion Saturday as UMass fans packed the stands. But Saunders made sure the Minutemen crowd left quietly.
The audience was anything but quiet as UMass jumped out to a game-high nine-point lead to start the second half.
Saunders then overheaded a crosscourt pass to sophomore Corbin Miller for a three. On the other end, he grabbed a defensive rebound and drove the length of the floor before dropping in a contested layup.
Then he came from nowhere to intercept a Trey Davis pass and feed junior Evan Cummins downcourt for a slam.
Saunders left the honor of totally eliminating the gap to himself, tying the game at 45 with a crossover and an up-and-under layup.
When he’s on, Saunders can appear downright arachnid.
Others struggle to protect the ball, guarding it with their arms and hoping to make it to the basket unthwarted. Saunders uses it as bait.
He sets up his defender with jab-steps, quarter-rotations and half-turns. His legs and arms all work in perfect synchronization until he’s got the defender right where he wants him, all spun around and outmatched. Usually the man trying to mark Saunders cannot see the ball-handlers plans until it’s too late. He’s caught in Saunders’ web—ensnared—and Saunders is laying the ball in, textbook leg and arm technique be damned.
He slips up sometimes—including a careless turnover at the top of the key Saturday—and his style does not make him the best partner for junior captain Siyani Chambers when it comes time to break a trap. But when his team needs a bucket, few in college basketball are as crafty or reliable as Saunders.
Still, the Minutemen proved game, struggling out of Saunder’s trap multiple times. The teams fought back and forth after Saunders tied the game at 45 before UMass’ Zach Coleman brought his supporters to their feet again with a dunk that put his team up three.
If you’ve been paying attention, you probably know what happened next. Saunders provided another lesson is space-creation and finishing, driving from right in front of Amaker to the basket, scoring two points despite drawing contact.
A play later, Chambers found Saunders for what looked like a lazy transition three-pointer to anyone that hasn’t watched the smooth senior cash them in for the better part of three years. This one went down too. Harvard was up two with just under seven minutes to play.
Massachusetts made one more push, tying the game with 1:14 left. Saunders earned and cashed in two free throws on the ensuing possession and then completed a three-point play, dribbling behind his back and hitting a six-footer while being pushed backwards.
“I just tried to…draw a foul or make a shot and luckily I did both,” he explained afterwards.
Saunders claimed a key defensive rebound with three seconds left to boot.
He finished with 27 points. With co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi limited by foul trouble and Chambers going scoreless in the first-half, Harvard needed just about all of them.
“Absolutely sensational,” Amaker said. “I thought he made critical baskets and critical plays for us to put us in position to win.”
Of course he was talking about Wesley Saunders.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks ago, I was sitting in the stands of the Bright-Landry Hockey Center, watching the Harvard men’s team host Yale. I was having a nice chat with Secretary of State John Kerry about the upcoming Iranian nuclear talks when a girl next to me asked her friend a question.
“Like, what is Harvard’s sport?”
Naturally, I felt inclined to jump in. If I had taken her question literally, I would have answered “squash” or “crew.” But I assumed from the way she asked the question she meant, “What is Harvard’s most nationally competitive revenue-generating sport?" Or, “What is Harvard’s hottest ticket?”
“Basketball,” I said. “Maybe football. So as I was saying, Jack….”
Two weeks later, I might have to amend my assessment. Right now, the Harvard men’s ice hockey team is the hottest ticket in Cambridge, and maybe the hottest team in all of men’s college hockey.
I don’t think I could have imagined writing that last sentence a month ago. Not after two historically bad campaigns in which losing and underperforming had seemed to become the status quo.
But after knocking off No. 1 Boston University and No. 4 UMass Lowell within a four day span on the road earlier this week, the No. 9/8 Crimson icemen look like proven winners. After entering the season off the national radar, Harvard received six first-place votes in the latest USCHO.com poll.
Through the first month of its 2014-2015 campaign, the team has rolled out a fast-paced, high-skill brand of hockey that has been fun to watch.
The Crimson’s first line ranks among the quickest and most potent combinations in the NCAA. Junior Jimmy Vesey, sophomore Alex Kerfoot, and junior co-captain Kyle Criscuolo have outskated every opponent they have faced this year while exhibiting a level of chemistry that Harvard has struggled to develop in recent seasons.
The talent doesn’t stop there.
On the second line, junior Brian Hart and sophomore Luke Esposito have also clicked and are on pace for career best numbers. Meanwhile, the third line, anchored by sophomore center Tyler Moy, has provided the Crimson with much-needed scoring depth.
At times, defenseman Patrick McNally has been the team’s best forward. The Canucks prospect has blitzed opposing defenses on multiple occasions with Bobby Orr-esque coast-to-coast strikes and leads all college defensemen with 1.30 points per game.
No discussion of the Crimson’s most valuable players would be complete without Steve Michalek. Through 10 starts, the junior goaltender has been a rock. His .947 save percentage is just a save or two off the national lead.
Beyond the talent, though, there’s something about this team that distinguishes it from recent seasons past. It’s an extra confidence, an extra swagger. The team’s upperclassmen are remembering what it feels like to win, and it feels good.
In overtime against BU, that swagger was on full display. With an early Vesey breakaway, it was clear right from the start of the extra frame that Harvard was not playing for the tie. Minutes later, Criscuolo netted the game winner after a dominating Crimson sequence in the Terrier zone.
This is a team that knows that it’s good, yet knows that it can improve. After each of Harvard’s last four wins, coach Ted Donato ’91 has pointed out significant stretches of play that his squad will have to address moving forward.
But that, perhaps, highlights the scariest thing about this team: its best hockey seems to be ahead of itself.
The offense is just starting to work in high-caliber junior forwards Greg Gozzo and Colin Blackwell off injured reserve. Reigning co-Ivy League Rookie of the Year Sean Malone is waiting in the wings.
The Crimson’s freshman skaters, meanwhile, are just getting acclimated to the college game. Rookie forwards Seb Lloyd and Jake Horton are poised to make big strides on the third line. Defenseman Wiley Sherman will continue to develop a skill set to complement his 6’7” frame.
Harvard hasn’t appeared in the national tournament since 2006 and hasn’t won a Beanpot since 1993. With a challenging conference schedule and a hungry BU team in the Crimson’s way, it’s far too early to tip this team as a favorite to break either of those streaks. The college hockey season is a volatile and capricious beast.
For now, though, fans can appreciate the team’s quick start. The squad’s recent play has evoked memories of a time when there was no doubt which sport was “Harvard’s sport.” Maybe by the end of the year, I’ll have a different answer for that girl’s question.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Six touchdowns. No interceptions. 358 yards passing.
It doesn’t take a mathematical genius to figure out that Houston Texans quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 had a pretty good game last Sunday. But in case Fitzpatrick—a former captain and standout for the Crimson—needs the confirmation of a numbers whiz, he can always turn to his younger son Brady.
At the end of the press conference following the Texans’ 45-21 win over the Tennessee Titans, Fitzpatrick introduced Brady, described by the New York Post as an “adorable human calculator.” Fitzpatrick the elder asked the crowd for two numbers between 90 and 99. When a reporter suggested 93 and 97, it took Brady only a few seconds of wide-eyed staring before he multiplied the numbers together to get 9,021.
The answer of over 9,000 might as well have described Fitzpatrick’s quarterback rating on the day. By tossing six touchdowns, Fitzpatrick not only set a franchise record, but he also recorded more passing scores than he had combined for over his previous nine games of action.
In the first week of November, a loss against the Eagles had led Houston to bench Fitzpatrick in favor of Ryan Mallett. But two games later, a chest injury ended Mallett’s season and landed Fitzpatrick back in the starter’s seat.
Against the Titans, Fitzpatrick showed no rust. He connected on 24 of 33 pass attempts, and his 10.85 yards per pass exceeded his season total by more than 2.5 yards. DeAndre Hopkins was the most frequent beneficiary of Fitzpatrick’s breakout, as the second-year wide receiver finished with 238 yards and two touchdowns on nine catches.
Fitzpatrick’s accomplishment loses a little luster given the fact that Tennessee boasts the league’s worst scoring defense. Last week, the Titans conceded 27 first-half points en route to a 43-24 drubbing by the Eagles. However, hope is on the horizon for Tennessee in the form of Eli Manning, who accounted for 70 passing yards and two lost fumbles in the second half of a loss to the Jaguars.
For many NFL players, a franchise-record performance might stand as a career highlight. But the picture is more complicated for Fitzpatrick, who participated in two undefeated seasons at Harvard. As a senior, Fitzpatrick won Ivy League Player of the Year after posting a 128.9 passer rating on the year. The season included a 21-point comeback against Brown to preserve perfection and, predictably, a 35-3 beat-down of Yale.

Sorry kiddo, but just because you don't have classes doesn't mean you're free. Maybe you have a lot more time, but there is also a lot more stuff to do. The key to reading period is mapping out time. Making a schedule isn't the sexiest use of time, but it sure beats writing a paper worth half of your grade in one night because you didn't account for the fact that an eloquent sentence is difficult to produce hungover.
