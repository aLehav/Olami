After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By now, the impact of the financial crisis on Harvard is old news.
With drastic budget cuts across its many schools and an endowment that dropped roughly 30 percent in the last fiscal year alone, the university, in tightening its belt, has also given careful consideration to the ways in which it can continue providing its essential programs and services in such a bleak economic environment. And one of Harvard’s better ideas in protecting both its financial health and efficiency has been to emphasize flexible funding and unrestricted donations in the development office.
In the wake of the news about the magnitude of the endowment’s decrease, university officials have been promoting an increase in flexible funds raised in order to ensure that major priorities like financial aid can still be met. In other words, rather than encouraging donors to give earmarked gifts for specific purposes, the university has wisely been trying to convince its benefactors to not restrict their donations and to allow their resources to be allocated for whatever purpose deemed most in need of funding.
As far as we can tell, those efforts seem to be working well: Although Harvard’s fundraising in general fell by eight percent in the last fiscal year, unrestricted gifts rose by 38 percent.
We are grateful that university fundraisers have made the decision to concentrate on soliciting unrestricted funds, as the financial comfort of the very recent past is unlikely to return anytime soon. Of course, earmarked gifts for specific programs or organizations with which donors were personally involved during their Harvard careers allow them the chance to “give back” to those institutions that afforded them a great experience—we do not dispute that claim.
But alumni and other philanthropists should understand that, in times like these, Harvard has a very real need for resources to fund what in better days might have seemed like basic components of the collegiate experience. As unglamorous or as impersonal as giving unrestricted funds may seem, we hope the Harvard donor network understands the gravity of the university’s current situation.
That said, we understand the hesitations that donors may have in giving money to Harvard for no clearly specified reason. Regardless of one’s opinion of the Harvard Management Corporation, the university no longer has a golden reputation when it comes to managing money effectively. The university should therefore strive for transparency with regard to both its budget and in how it will allocate these unrestricted funds—if not to reveal the details of how they will be spent, then at least to ensure donors that they will be spent wisely.

The Afghan theater is quickly becoming the main act in the Obama administration’s Middle East policy. As a result, the success of U.S. efforts in the region is inextricably tied to that of the Afghan government and its establishment as a legitimate authority. Unfortunately, the recent withdrawal of Abdullah Abdullah from the Afghan presidential race represents a poor decision on Abdullah’s part and a step back on Afghanistan’s road to recovery. Abdullah’s decision not to challenge incumbent Hamid Karzai in a runoff election can be explained as a principled protest of the widespread fraud present in the electoral proceedings, but it also means the controversial Karzai’s legitimacy as a ruler will not be popularly affirmed, but instead ordained by electoral officials suspected of corruption and fraud.
This peculiar turn of events has left Afghanistan with a leader who, after discounting illegitimate ballots, did not meet the 50 percent vote threshold required to be declared president of Afghanistan after the first round of voting. While there was no guarantee that fraud would not plague the runoff as well, Abdullah’s participation in a second round of voting would have enhanced the legitimacy of the election. A runoff, which would have been subject to intense public scrutiny, would have at least represented a new opportunity for a more open election and given the victor some level of legitimacy that is not currently present.
Without a viable opposition opponent like Abdullah, an election would have been pointless. So while Abdullah’s decision may have been a politically expedient tactic, especially considering his probable loss, it is neither a service to the Afghan people nor to the stability of its government.
While he will continue to govern his tumultuous nation, it is entirely unclear that Hamid Karzai is capable of presiding over a stable Afghanistan. As America determines its policy in the region moving forward, it should not be any more confident in Afghanistan’s leader than in its electoral process and should avoid depending on the country’s shaky government for support.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer once wrote, “To understand the workings of American politics, you have to understand this fundamental law: Conservatives think liberals are stupid. Liberals think conservatives are evil.” After my life in the South and my education here at Harvard, I think he has the first part backward.
The first inklings of this realization came to me during my pre-frosh weekend. “Where are you from?” asked a Harvard student, to which I replied, “Georgia.” Just plain, unexotic Georgia, one of the 50 states of the same country in which Harvard is a part. Then, for the first time in my life, my home state was confused for a former Communist satellite, and I had to clarify: No, I was referring to the Southern state. For the past four years, this clarification has inevitably been followed by statements such as “Why would your parents immigrate there?” and “Did you grow up on a farm?”
At first, my response to this insulting misrepresentation of my home was an indignant, “No, I did not grow up on a farm. I’m from the Atlanta area.” However, I’ve learned that often at Harvard, “Atlanta” generates as much recognition as “Timbuktu,” or perhaps even less—it’s a city that one vaguely remembers hearing about but doesn’t remember in what context. Although I accept jokes at the expense of my being from the uncivilized terrain of the South with a patient smile, I find it a bit frustrating that brilliant Harvard students can be so ignorant about the region. How is it that students who can spew out detailed histories of Shanghai or Cairo can look at me confusedly when I point out that the 1996 Olympics were in Georgia well within our lifetimes?
The answer, I believe, lies in our liberal hubris. I know, because I myself have been guilty of it. When I was accepted into Harvard, I rejoiced at the prospect of joining a liberal, intellectual community. There, I thought, everyone would be politically correct, sophisticated, and physically fit. I would easily be able to find non-pork options in restaurants. Boston, the birthplace of our revolution, would be even more vibrant than Atlanta. Basically, whatever I had in Atlanta I would find in Boston and Cambridge several degrees better (except as regards the weather).
Imagine my surprise when I found that Boston, although beautiful and sophisticated in a historical, stately way, was a far cry from my image of modern sophistication. I had fallen into the trap of viewing even my own home as an “other,” the land of Republicans—the land of George W. Bush, with his comical attachment to his ranch and his linguistic gaffes. Like others, I may have been influenced by the numerous studies and newspaper articles trying to convince me that once I left the red-state border, I would be met by nothing less than brilliance.
At Harvard, I have found myself having to explain that, actually, Atlanta and its surrounding areas are highly metropolitan. We even have schools. In fact, my high school offered every Advanced Placement class and was more diverse than Harvard. Atlanta is home to CNN, Coca-Cola, the world’s busiest airport, and the fifth-largest number of Fortune 500 companies, falling behind two shockingly Southern cities—Houston and Dallas. True, you can find serene, peaceful farms if you drive for a few hours outside of Atlanta, a similar experience to taking the train out from Paris or any other cosmopolitan city. I’ve been to a farm once, and that was because my enthusiastic parents wanted to show me what farm animals look like in real life. Yet despite Georgia’s decisive modernity, I am still the brunt of redneck jokes, all the more outlandish because I am not red, or even white, but just plain brown.
Perhaps a class on the South might help address Harvard students’ ignorance and help us in our quest to make General Education requirements more relevant; courses like “Southern Literature and Culture in the United States” seeking to illuminate this heart of darkness do exist, but they are rare. Alternatively, the Office of Career Services could encourage students to explore a broader range of job opportunities in economically vibrant areas of the South that remain relatively unexplored here. Or the dining halls could replace Nestea with real, brewed, Southern-style iced tea. There are myriad possibilities to alert Harvard students that civilization extends beyond the blue-state borders—but, until then, some of us will have to keep repeating that we’re more than just country bumpkins.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I recently visited the Harvard Book Store to catch a glimpse of its newly acquired Book Espresso Machine, the $100,000 apparatus that can print a fully bound, 300-page book in four minutes.
The machine’s unveiling had been the day before, but the shop maintained all the buzz and novelty of a miniature, latter-day Great Exposition. In the back of the shop, a crowd of about 15 onlookers pressed around an attendant performing a demonstration. A graduate student couple beamed at each other. Old men shook their heads and grinned.
The book machine is well worth a look: It actually comprises two machines. One resembles an industrial-sized copier, and the other reminds me of that baroque execution device from Kafka’s “In the Penal Colony.” A transparent casing surrounds the latter half, affording a view of the various gears, clamps, trays, and rollers in action.
The printing process is speedy and impressive. The copier rapidly spits out a thick stack of pages, which the machine then clamps, rotates, and binds with hot glue into a card-stock jacket. Two blades, regrettably obscured from view, thresh off the book’s edges until it is cut to size. Finally, the finished product is deposited, like a bottle of soda from a vending machine, into a compartment near the bottom. Apart from their unadorned covers, the books look and feel indistinguishable from those on the shelves.
To my surprise, only a bare few onlookers actually seemed interested in buying something made by the machine. The male graduate student ordered a Spanish-language book on aesthetic theory; I bought a Victorian novel. It felt warm in my hands—literally hot off the press. Most people, however, were content to “ooh” and “aah” and feel as if they had witnessed a bit of print history.
I’m undecided on whether this technology means very much for booksellers, but the tepidness I saw in the other patrons made me doubt that it does. Even if the digital inventory expands far beyond the stock of out-of-copyright titles that the machine currently prints, I have to wonder whose book ownership needs are so extensive and obscure that they cannot be met by Amazon.com or the local bookstore. One answer, of course, is academics and bookworms—real constituencies, to be sure, but ones whose pent-up demand, alas, seems unlikely to revolutionize the business.
For those academics and bookworms, however, what a coup this machine is! One can almost begin to imagine the fulfillment of that utopian dream held by book collectors since at least the 15th century: a comprehensive, universal library—a single place where nearly every surviving printed book in English can be accessed within minutes. Perhaps they will still cost, but they will be available, all of them, in print.
As soon as I envision this admittedly distant prospect, though, I can’t help but feel a measure of nostalgia, already, mixed with my exhilaration. Last summer, I spent a glorious week in Dublin at the National Library of Ireland, reading dusty volumes of 18th-century pamphlets for my thesis. In the world after Google Books has conquered all libraries and the Book Espresso Machine has delivered them all to bookstores around the country, will such trips even be necessary?
The Book Espresso Machine, Google Books, and the myriad other print digitization schemes now afoot carry the danger of turning research into something that can be conducted without ever leaving the compass of one’s local bookstore—or even one’s desk. Surely the heyday of the academic as an explorer, an adventurer, traveling to distant libraries in search of rare and exotic books, has already passed. But must technology wipe away all vestiges of that former side to the vocation?
Of course, no serious researcher can believe that these developments represent anything other than a boon for academic research. Digitized books save vast amounts of time. They assist those unable to pay for travel to faraway libraries. And their text-searchability makes possible scholarship that would have been unthinkable 20 years ago.
Yet I can’t help but feel reservations. The challenge of looking for an elusive book is one of the singular joys of scholarship for me, part of what rescues it from becoming a mere exercise in pedantry or reinterpretation. Even Harvard’s relatively sensible library system has supplied me with a few pleasurable scavenger hunts. Now a Google search and a glorified Xerox machine threaten to supersede that entire process.
Borges, in that haunting short story “The Library of Babel,” imagined the universal library as a dystopia, where “the shelves register every possible combination of the twenty-odd orthographical symbols,” where the availability of all possible books means the reliability of none, and where the librarians spend their days searching vainly for a master catalog which must, by logic, exist somewhere amid the annals of nonsense. I fear for the opposite: a world where finding the proper book is all too easy and simple.

Two weeks ago, 18 scientific organizations wrote the United States Congress to “state the consensus scientific view” on global warming.  The letter, signed by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Meteorological Society, and the American Statistical Association (among others), declared that “climate change is occurring, and...that the greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are the primary driver.” The letter took special care to point out that “contrary assertions are inconsistent with an objective assessment of the vast body of peer-reviewed science.” The next morning, the Pew  Research Center for the People & the Press revealed that the reminder was painfully necessary. In the past 20 months, the number of Americans who view global warming as a serious problem has decreased by nine percent. And, despite mounting scientific evidence to the contrary, the number of Americans who believe in global warming has reached a three-year low. More Americans are willing to spit in the face of scientifically supported, objective reasoning, counterintuitively tailoring their perception of facts to their beliefs.
The opposite approach should be instinctual. People are exposed to and absorb information. They make valid logical inferences based on that information. They form beliefs based on those inferences. They act according to those beliefs. When they are exposed to new and different information or analyses, they modify their beliefs and actions accordingly. Novelist Jonathan Safran Foer used this framework to describe his struggle with vegetarianism. As a child, the notion of eating meat as hurting animals had never occurred to him, so he happily consumed his grandmother’s chicken. Later, when his babysitter asked him a life-changing question—“You know that chicken is chicken, right?”—he had no choice but to modify his diet. Foer argued that, for years, he was simply innocent, “just...a child, ignorant of the world’s workings. Until I wasn’t. At which point I had to change my life.” The process isn’t clean. It involves constant and exhausting reevaluation and pride-swallowing. And there are slip-ups, to be sure, moments of weakness and temptation. But these are recognized as downsides in the complex formulation of and obedience to our ever-changing system of norms.
So, in a digital age, when more people have access to more information than ever before, why are so many beliefs consistently inconsistent with scientific reality? Many blame what Nicholas Negroponte of MIT describes as the “Daily Me,” the highly customized and personalized  manner in which people receive information on the web. This allows individuals to bypass information that might contradict their views, stagnating the process of self-reflection and revision. Cass R. Sunstein ’75, head of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, takes this theory a step further: not only has the information age prevented us from evolving, but in many respects we have also devolved. The Internet allows us to separate into self-reinforcing groups that sometimes spread falsities, which results in the polarization of our views, a process Sunstein refers to as cyberbalkanization.
Elizabeth Kolbert questions the matter-of-factness of Sunstein’s theory in her review of his latest book “On Rumors,” which she describes as “pointedly nonjudgmental.” “There’s a temptation,” she writes, “to confuse the medium with the message, to assume that, because the Internet is being used to produce a certain political effect, it was somehow destined to do so.” Kolbert is right to point out that, while the Internet has given people a more convenient means of reaffirming their opinions with heavily filtered information, the intentions of those individuals are fundamentally flawed. They are, as writer and critic Andrew Lang once quipped, the type who “use statistics as a drunken man uses lamp-posts—for support rather than illumination.”
The problem is age-old. In his autobiography, Benjamin Franklin described his own struggle with vegetarianism. After he resolved to give up meat, he found himself tempted by the smell of a frying cod. He swayed “between Principle & Inclination” but eventually resolved that since cod readily eat smaller fish, he was entitled to eat “animal food” as well. “So convenient a thing it is to be a reasonable Creature,” he declared, “it enables one to find or make a Reason for every thing one has a mind to do.” The very fact that most feel this need to rationalize their behavior implies a desire to come to logical conclusions about what is right or wrong, rather than abstracting these notions outside the realm of the arguable.
The key, then, is to approach the process genuinely, to acquire knowledge to illuminate our ideals rather than to support them. The lesson is particularly relevant for members of the Harvard community. What a shame to be deemed “educated,” having acquired eight semesters’ worth of facts and figures but not challenged or changed the principles based upon them. As we come to the unsavory realization that we will, one day, have to leave this stimulating environment behind, the need to engage in discussion that tests our existing beliefs, despite potential blows to our egos, becomes particularly pressing. It is, after all, the rational thing to do.

Boston mayor Thomas M. Menino, was reelected to serve an unprecedented fifth consecutive term last night, putting a new flourish on a political legacy that has already led some commentators to jokingly brand him “mayor for life.”
Defying predictions that this would be a close race, Menino defeated his opponent, former City Councilor Michael F. Flaherty, by a margin of 15 percent, according to unofficial election results provided by the City of Boston’s Web site.
With over 100,000 voters at the polls—the highest number in a mayoral election since 1993—Menino garnered 57 percent of the vote, or 63,123 ballots, to Flaherty’s 42 percent, or 46,768 ballots.
Former City Councilor  mayoral candidate Lawrence S. DiCara ’71, who said he continues to follow Boston politics closely, described the mayor’s relationship with Harvard as “cooperative.”
“They’ve been working together on Allston,” DiCara said. “That doesn’t mean that Harvard can buy up land and do nothing with it, though.”
He added that “the mayor had a good working relationship with [former University President Lawrence H.] Summers and I’ve heard that he has a good working relationship with [University President] Drew Faust.”
While DiCara emphasized that he would not make any value judgements regarding whether the mayor’s reelection was good or bad for the University, he did say that Menino’s experience with Harvard would allay the need for any learning curve.
“Nobody will have to go to school,” he said. “He knows what the issues are and he can call up the president and the president can call up him and that’s good.”
Menino, who ran on the slogan “moving Boston forward,” pledged to make the city safer and greener, uphold its diversity, ensure access to quality education for all, maintain fiscal stability, reduce homelessness, and invest in job creation.
In his victory speech, the 66-year-old former insurance salesman acknowledged the challenges that his ambitious platform will face in the coming four years.
“To bring our city together, to move it forward we are going to need all our strengths,” the Hyde Park resident said in his thick Boston accent. “So celebrate this evening and rest up tonight, because our work begins tomorrow.”
DiCara. who said he was pleased with the election’s results, added that he thought the mayor would be able to push through the complacency of union interests—initiating things like mandatory drug and alcohol testing for firefighters—while “look[ing] towards bold initiatives as his legacy.”
Menino, DiCara said, would be able to reform “some of the bureaucracy that has stymied this city since I was a freshman in Pennypacker.”
The former city councilor attributed Menino’s victory to his solid following among “people of color, liberals, and Italians.”
He described these groups as “the informal coalition who have elected most every mayor in the modern era.”
DiCara said that while Flaherty’s challenge of Menino was “quite bold,” his failure was due to the fact that he was “unable to peel way some of the pieces of that coalition.”
Despite his loss, Flaherty struck an optimistic note in his concession speech tonight. “What we’ve learned tonight is that change takes some time,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council renewed its push for a new grants program proposed last semester that would fund upperclassman social events­—and limited alcohol purchases—but its efforts have been stalled by the College administration.
The UC Student Initiatives Committee introduced a grants program proposal last month that included revisions and additional restrictions to April’s Social Grants Act to alleviate ensuing administrator concerns raised last semester.
The Student Initiated Programming Fund would allow upperclassmen ages 21 and above to apply for up to $200 of retroactive UC funding for student events—including parties—in common spaces in the Houses.
Under the proposal, party hosts must stay sober and only one third of the grant may be used for purchasing beer or wine—a figure that reflects the number of House residents of legal drinking age, according to committee chair Mallika Khandelwal ’11.
The UC will award grants to fund one student event in each of the four House neighborhoods every weekend that would be open to all students in the nearby Houses.
In spite of the restrictions added in response to the College’s earlier concerns, the proposal has been met with continued resistance. House Masters and other administrators have argued that the revisions are not enough to prevent underage drinking—the driving issue behind the demise of the UC’s party grant fund two years ago.
A TWO-YEAR HANGOVER?
The UC has historically struggled to find common ground with the administration on funding social events where alcohol is served.
In Oct. 2007, then-Interim Dean of the College David R. Pilbeam penned a sharply worded letter to the UC, ending the four-year-old party grant program, which had distributed $1750 per week to fund private student events. Pilbeam accused the UC of condoning parties that centered around alcohol and turning a blind eye to underage drinking.
“What prompted the [party grant] policy to change is that when we have public events, we have to be sure we’re doing our best to regulate events and make them safe,” Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson said last week.
“We can’t be a safe haven for service of alcohol to minors,” said Nelson, who at the time was associate dean of residential life.
Last year, members of the UC began developing a new program to meet the “need” left by the abrupt termination of the old party grants, according to UC President Andrea R. Flores ’10. “People really feel the absence of the party fund,” she said.The Social Grants Act was approved in April and included many of the same restrictions carried over to the current proposal in order to appease many of the administration’s concerns, former UC Finance Committee Chair Sundeep S. Iyer ’10 said.
The Social Grants Act authorized a pilot program to be launched during reading period last semester, but Iyer said the program was sidelined because the UC had its hands full with other projects.
Despite the added measures in the Social Grants Act—which were initially approved by Nelson and then-Associate Dean of the College Judith H. Kidd—the administration later backtracked after House Masters voiced concerns that the program was too similar to the old UC party grants system.
WORKING ON IT
Cognizant of the delicate nature of funding social events where alcohol is likely to be served, UC members said that the current SIP Fund proposal is fundamentally different from the 2007 party grants fund.
“I think the entire intent has changed. It is [about] student-initiated events, not necessarily parties,” Khandelwal said, likening the proposed program to the grants offered by the Freshman Dean’s Office for freshman-initiated events.
George X. Huang ’12, a representative from Winthrop House who was heavily involved in developing the current proposal, said the SIP fund’s focus is to support medium-sized social events, which are rarely seen at Harvard.
“It’s centered around providing a new type of socialization on campus that alcohol may or may not be necessary for,” he said.
The proposal also incorporates new measures to address some of the concerns of House Masters raised last spring, such as mandating that the host of the party remain sober throughout the event.
Khandelwal said that House Masters were primarily worried about providing effective supervision to prevent underage drinking and damage to House property.
Last Friday, members of the UC met with Nelson to discuss the current proposal.
According to Khandelwal, Nelson continued to raise concerns about adequate supervision and insisted on oversight of the event by either resident tutors or Beverage Authorization Teams—graduate students trained to prevent underage drinking. Khandelwal said that both options are unfeasible due to financial constraints and staffing challenges.
Although the meeting resulted in a postponement of final decisions, Nelson said that she is keeping an open mind about the SIP Fund.
“[The UC has] taken comments from me and others, and they’ve really tried to shape their proposal accordingly,” Nelson said. “This is a good example of collaborative exchange.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time since the seniors of the current Radcliffe Rugby Football Club walked onto the team, the tight-knit group of roughly 25 women might end the season on a triumphal cadence.
Once a team floundering at the bottom of their division, Radcliffe Rugby finished the fall regular season undefeated. Now in the playoffs, only two games stand between the recently reinvigorated team and a spot at nationals in the spring.
What is underlying this comeback is not only amped up recruitment and placement in a new division, but also a close community capable of overcoming both team tragedy and past defeat. Perhaps the best representation of this community—bound by a sport that is rough yet highly personal—is what team members call a unifying facet of the game: rugby songs.
“They’re basically really vulgar songs,” Amy J. Uber ’10-11 says. “I’m trying to think of a clean one.”
A SPORT UNLIKE ANY OTHER
There was a rainstorm the day before Radcliffe rugby’s first round play-off game early last week against Boston College. The intramural fields behind Harvard stadium were so sloppy that even in cleats, the players kept slipping through the muck. These are terrible conditions to play in, Uber—who broke her fibula in an early season game—comments from the sidelines, but it makes the game cinematic.
“It is a rough sport,” Uber says, “we like to show off our bruises.”Just as the sport’s songs remain largely unknown to the average American spectator, so too do the general rules of rugby.
“It seems like a really brute game but really it requires a lot of intelligence and strategy,” Margaret G. “Meg” McCarty ’12 says as she watches her team run through a drill during a Wednesday morning practice a few days after the BC game.
It’s raining, and the players—who aren’t wearing any protective gear except mouth guards—appear to converge on the large, egg-shaped ball and collapse into a heap.The play resumes, and the women continue to shout colorful jargon at each other. “During the game rugby has so much more communication than any other sport because it’s so complicated,” Captain Anna M. Ruman ’10 says. “You have to constantly, constantly be talking,” the team’s other captain, Rachelle M. Calixte ’10 chimes in. “I almost always lose my voice after a game.”
A “breakdown,” they explain, occurs when a player with the ball is tackled to the ground. A “ruck” occurs when players from both teams fight for the ball after a tackle. The ball can travel down the field, they explain, by being kicked or carried, but not thrown forward. If the ball goes out of bounds, it is returned to play in a “line-out.” During a line-out both teams form pods around a player and guide her into the air, helping her try to catch the ball. For a moment, this near lift resembles a cheerleading move.
“It’s sort of like a jump ball on steroids,” says Jennifer O. Middleton ’10, the club’s president.  After each game, the players explain, it’s time to party—with the other team.
I DON’T WANNA BE A HOUSEWIFE
“We bring a grill and we barbecue after the game,” says Uber, who is one of the team’s social chairs. “And we go back to someone’s dorm room and basically we drink and sing songs.”
It is a rugby tradition for opposing teams to socialize after the game, and rugby songs are a staple of any post-game get-together.
Most teams know the words to the choruses, and verses often incorporate players’ names and positions. “They generally all have to do with drinking or something like that,” Uber says, trying to pick one she could sing for The Crimson.
“I like ‘House Wife,’” Ruman says. “The lyrics are a little edgy,” Calixte adds, “but that’s a song everyone knows.”
“You sing about how you don’t want to be a housewife, you don’t want to scrub his floors, you don’t want to give him babies,” Ruman says, summarizing the song’s content.
“And then because that’s kind of heteronormative, we also have a song ‘I Don’t Wanna Be a Straight Girl.’”
Uber acknowledges the stereotype that a lot of female rugby players are lesbians. “Our team kind of makes a joke of it,” she says. “You have to accept that if you play rugby you play because you love the sport.”
Nicole K. Poteat ’11, who is the team’s alumnae relations officer and Uber’s roommate, says she wasn’t even aware of the stereotype when she joined the team. “It’s completely not an advertising point or a selling point for us,” Poteat said.
“The nice thing about it is that it does mean we have a very, very open community,” she says, contrasting her experience with other teams where locker room chatter revolved around guys. “Conversations are gender-neutral,” she says. Poteat points out that the majority of Radcliffe’s current team is straight, adding, “No matter what the make up of the team is sexuality-wise, it still maintains that very open community.”
A TEAM’S TRAGEDY
The team drew even closer last May after the sudden death of Kathlene S.G. Joo ’11.
After falling silent for a minute, Middleton explains, “The rugby team to a lot of us is a family and when you lose someone in your family you rally around them.”
Uber, who was one of Joo’s roommates, says the team was together shortly before Joo died. Uber had to tell the rest of the team the next day.
“Within a matter of days we managed to rent vans and get hotels and drive to Pittsburgh for her funeral,” she says.
“Instead of addressing it directly, it’s more that we’ve come together a lot,” says Poteat, who was also one of Joo’s roommates. Ruman and Calixte say it was a difficult period to be captains, but time and a summer away has helped a lot.
“I’m sure some people think of the fall season as being for Kathlene,” Ruman says.Uber says she agrees, “A lot of people do when they put on a Radcliffe jersey have her in mind.”
Though it is still too soon to drop her name into conversation, Uber says the team has found ways to commemorate Joo.
“We just celebrated her 21st birthday,” Uber said, “We wore her favorite type of clothing and drank her favorite type of beer.”
“I think it’s very evident when you join that this group of people is very strong,” Poteat added.
WE JUST PLAY FOR RECREATION
At Harvard, rugby is a club sport, but that doesn’t mean team members take it lightly. The team practices at least three times a week, sometimes with a fourth optional practice run by the captains, and most players also train on their own.
In Division I, the team constantly faced tough competition, and since the beginning of this year has played in Division II.
Because it is a club sport, the team is responsible for everything from arranging fields and transportation to drawing up starting line-ups to hiring coaches.
Head coach Bryan Hamlin hails from the rugby heartland, New Zealand. After he stopped playing himself, he said he wanted to “give back” to the sport. Assistant coach Shannon Wallace plays for the Beantown women’s club team in Boston. “This season we’ve done a really great job of bringing up our level of play,” Wallace says. “Usually when you come back from the off-season you have to reteach.”
But this year, she says, “We didn’t have to start from scratch.”
After practice last Wednesday, the team finally sang a rugby song for The Crimson.
Calixte says she likes their chosen song, “Fifteen Fit Señoritas,” because of its lyrics.
“We don’t play for admiration, we don’t play for victory, we just play for recreation,” the team sings.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An altercation outside of a Boston nightclub hosting a party for Harvard Business School students resulted in an arrest for assault and battery on a police officer last Friday, according to a city police report.
Boston Police said that staff from the  Tequila Rain club approached police at 11:24 pm after two people—one male and one female—attempted to gain reentry after being removed from the club. The male suspect grabbed a police officer by the neck as he was being escorted away from the club, according to the police report.
The report also said that the female suspect, claiming to be a citizen of Lebanon, accused police of racism and attempted to take photographs of the altercation, saying “This is going to get us a lot of money.”
Police declined to release the suspects’ names. A representative for the Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office said the names could not be obtained after courts closed.
The incident occurred during the “Priscilla Ball,” an annual event hosted by the HBS Australian and New Zealand Club, where male students typically dress in drag. About 680 HBS students attended the ball last Friday.Jon Schoeck, general manager of Tequila Rain, said that several students attending the party had already been asked to leave the club or had been denied entry because they were heavily intoxicated.
In an e-mail to MBA students, MBA Program Chair Joseph L. Badaracco, Jr. said that “disciplinary action may follow” for those students involved.Badaracco added that the incident last Friday was out of character for HBS students.
“We set the bar high for our life and work at HBS, and our students, staff, and faculty work hard to clear it,” Badaracco said. “Such incidents also reflect poorly on all of us and create negative ripple effects that last a good while.”
Badaracco’s e-mail also said the incident “resulted in injuries to students.” But Schoeck said he was aware of only one male student who badly cut his foot after removing his high heels.Schoeck described Friday’s crowd as one of the “top five” worst behaved he has experienced in his career as a bar manager. According to Schoeck, “only 40 or 50” of attendees were rowdy.
“For the most prestigious university in America, they should be embarrassed at the way they handled themselves,” he said.
Both the HBS Australian and New Zealand Club and an HBS spokesman declined to comment.

A recent Harvard Law School graduate has been accused of setting fire to a New York City chapel that houses the remains of unidentified victims of the 9/11 attacks, leading to public outrage from the victims’ families.
Brian A. Schroeder, who graduated from the Law School last spring, turned himself into the police Monday on arson charges after a fire broke out at the chapel the morning of October 31.
Schroeder—whom The New York Daily News branded as “New York’s newest Public Enemy #1”—was arrested on counts of third degree arson, first degree reckless endangerment, second degree criminal mischief, and third degree burglary, according to the New York Police Department.
Schroeder was reportedly drunk at the time of the incident, and Schroeder’s attorney has claimed to media outlets that his client may have been drugged during a night of partying over Halloween weekend.
The fire left victims’ remains unscathed but damaged mementos placed by victims’ families on wooden benches in the chapel. The remains of unidentified victims of the 9/11 attacks are stored in the chapel while they await DNA identification and transfer to their permanent resting place at the 9/11 memorial, which is currently under construction.
According to media reports, Schroeder’s mother claims that he does not remember anything from the incident. Other reports indicate that the act was done as part of a drunken dare.
Schroeder has now been fired from his position at Sidley Austin, a prestigious, multinational law firm with offices in World Trade Center North, where he was due to begin work this coming January. The firm lost one of their employees, a switchboard operator, in the 2001 attacks.Classmates of Schroeder at the Law School contacted by The Crimson either did not return repeated requests for comment or declined to comment.
But according to media reports the act surprised those who know Schroeder, who served as co-president of Lambda, the school’s LGBT student organization, during his time as a student.
“I know him as someone happy to help out first years or simply give a comforting hug in the library,” said Daniel Kelly, a Lambda board member. “I know him as someone who was deeply passionate about creating a welcoming and supportive atmosphere at the law school.”
Families of 9/11 victims expressed outrage towards Schroeder for what they deemed an insult to their deceased family members.
“Why are the good people gone and the losers still with us?” Sally Regenhard, whose son was a firefighter killed in the attacks, was quoted as saying in media reports.
“I don’t know what they teach these kids at Harvard,” retired FDNY Deputy Chief Jim Riches said. Riches’ son Jimmy, a firefighter, died on 9/11.

Syndicated political columnist Kathleen Parker does not consider herself a pundit, she told attendees yesterday at a brown-bag lunch discussion entitled “The Problem With Punditry.”
“I like to think of myself as a columnist,” said Parker, at the Harvard Kennedy School event. “A columnist is first and foremost a journalist.”
Citing her own experiences as a television analyst and columnist, Parker expressed reservations with what she called a “culture of punditry,” in which the purported experts being interviewed are forced to take one side or another “because there has to be a fight.”
In order to offer an opinion on television, “it really isn’t so necessary to know anything” about a particular subject, Parker said, citing several times when she was asked to appear on a show to discuss something she had no knowledge of. In many cases, Parker said, “empty punditry” and entertainment value tend to take the place of insightful opinion.
A columnist with the Washington Post Writers Group whose bi-weekly columns appear in newspapers and magazines around the country, Parker added that she did not see the punditry problem going away anytime soon, simply because appearing on television tends to be such an attractive opportunity.
“For every [one] who says no, there are 100 people who want to be on TV,” she said. “How many people really do have something to say?” she later asked, drawing laughter from the audience. Answering audience questions during the event about why the public continues to tolerate pundits, Parker said that people simply tend to look for affirmations of their beliefs in any speaker, making a nuanced critical response difficult. “People are awfully quick to absorb what they already think,” she said.

“Challenges to Faith at Harvard,”a panel discussion moderated by the Harvard Political Union last night, examined the social and intellectual pressures that influence undergraduates’s religious life.
The panelists and audience were in agreement that more religious discourse should occur on campus in order to incorporate the diversity of religious viewpoints.  Many of the panelists said that Harvard’s climate helped to ground their religious beliefs.
“At Harvard, I am forced to think about what I believe, and to explain why I believe X,Y, or Z,” said Aneesh V. Kulkarni ’10, a member of Dharma, Harvard’s Hindu organization.
Batool Z. Ali’10, a member of the Harvard Islamic Society, offered a similar sentiment. “The unashamed character of people who have faith at Harvard is really refreshing,” said Ali.
However, some panelists said that Harvard’s attitude towards religion is at times problematic.  “At Harvard, we are told to think critically about every aspect of our lives, except for faith and religion”, said Stephanie M. Cole ’11, a member of the Harvard-Radcliffe Christian Fellowship.
Daniel P. Robinson ‘10, a member of the Harvard Secular Society, echoed this idea.  “While political views can be challenged, religious views are sometimes considered off-limits, which is a problem,” said Robinson.
The panelists in turn said that pluralism is included in each religious tradition.
“You don’t have to agree to a certain political opinion in order to be a member of the Catholic Student Association,” said Katherine J. Calle ’10. “The expression two Jews, four opinions is a good one, I think,” said Jason W. Schnier ’11, a member of Hillel.
Shankar G. Ramaswamy ‘11, the discussion’s moderator, said the event’s co-sponsorship by a number of religious groups—including Hillel, the Harvard-Radcliffe Catholic Student Association, Dharma, the Harvard Islamic Society, the Harvard Secular Society, HRCF, and the Harvard College Interfaith Council—reflected Harvard’s diversity.
Students said they welcomed the exchange of religious ideas.
“Quite often this matter doesn’t arise in your day-to-day interactions with people. It’s still important for Harvard to allow students to talk to each other about religious issues,” said Christopher D. Wood ’12.
“These types of discussions should definitely happen more often,” said Rachel A. Levy ’11,
Jessie J. Jiang contributed to the reporting of this story.

The reported number of confirmed H1N1 “swine flu” cases nationwide is likely a considerable underestimation of the total sum of actual illnesses, according to a recent study conducted by researchers at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and Harvard School of Public Health.
The study, published in the CDC journal “Emerging Infectious Diseases,” estimated that the total number of swine flu cases in the United States between April and July 2009 ran up to 140 times higher than the number of cases confirmed by laboratory tests.
Researchers on the study concluded that the actual number of cases hovered anywhere from 1.8 million to 5.7 million cases: far more than the 43,677 lab-confirmed cases that were identified nationwide through July, according to the paper. “Not every case, by a long shot, got reported...Once the number of cases grew, issues of capacity made testing and reporting even more significant,” wrote Marc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health and a co-author of the study, in an e-mail.
“There are limited resources for testing and exponentially growing numbers of people to be tested,” Lipsitch wrote.
Though it is difficult to find accurate epidemiological numbers, more exact estimation will help to inform vaccine and treatment recommendation to improve predictions of future spread, Lipsitch wrote. The CDC reported on October 23 that the fast-moving “swine flu” pandemic had spread to 177 countries worldwide and that flu activity remains widespread in 46 U.S. states. The latest weekly report from the World Health Organization only accounts for 440,000 laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic H1N1 influenza through the end of October throughout the globe, admitting that the case count is likely to be significantly lower than the actual number of cases as “many countries have stopped counting individual cases.”
According to David S. Rosenthal ’59, director of Harvard University Health Services, UHS has seen between 40 and 60 cases a week of influenza-like illness.
Explaining possible reasons why swine flu cases could go unnoticed, Rosenthal said that many people are asymptomatic or may suffer less severe symptoms after gaining a level of passive immunity from being exposed to the disease in roommates or colleagues.
“The good news is that so far, [swine flu] is no worse than the seasonal flu... the population of undergraduates, students seem to be managing well.” Robert J. Blendon, professor of Health Policy and Political Analysis at the Harvard School of Public Health defended the importance of studying unreported flu cases in an interview this week, saying that they could be important in raising public awareness.
“These debates about how many cases there are, are very important...a very widespread disease will prompt people to take many precautions,” he said. “If they are less worried, they will take fewer precautionary steps that they might not have done.”l

Michelle M. Parilo ’10 and Nimi P. Katragadda ’10 will join the Senior Class Committee as secretary and treasurer respectively, the Harvard Alumni Association announced yesterday.
The two seniors were chosen from a pool of 10 candidates running for each position to plan Senior Week and help organize class events after graduation, according to Alexandra Monti, the Alumni Association’s senior coordinator.
Parilo, who is the president of the Seneca, an all-female social club, said that she looks forward to reaching out to the senior class as the 2010 Class Committee’s main contact.
“The seniors can expect to get a lot of emails from me,” said Parilo, who has already served as a representative on the Alumni Association’s undergraduate relations committee. “I want to make sure that every senior has an event they’re excited about senior week.”
The Californian native said that she hopes to use her new position to keep the senior class connected after graduation, as it is often difficult to stay in touch with the Harvard community “when it is no longer right outside your door.”
“I see it as my role as secretary to keep the 2010 family together in a tight-knit community next year when we’ll be spread throughout the world,” Parilo said.
Katragadda echoed Parilo’s interest in building and maintaining a sense of community.The former co-president of the Harvard Undergraduate Women in Business organization said that she hopes to maximize the benefits seniors get from the dues they pay.
“I want to bring in a lot of new and creative ideas that haven’t been pursued in the past,” Katragadda said, such as transitioning to an online alumni newsletter to save print and distribution costs.
The two newly elected class officers cited their appreciation for the Harvard community as their central motivation for running.
“I’ve gained so much from my time at Harvard and am so grateful for the experience,” Katragadda said, adding that she wanted to “give back” to the community.
Parilo added that she hopes her enthusiasm for Harvard will be “contagious.”

Turkish Nobel Laureate Orhan Pamuk delivered his sixth and final Norton lecture at Sanders Theatre yesterday, highlighting the importance of finding a novel’s “secret center.”
“When we first open a novel, we are looking for its secret center, its greater meaning,” Pamuk told an audience of over 700.
“Reading a novel is the act of investigating what the secret center of the novel is and enjoying the aesthetic pleasure of the details along the way.”
Pamuk concluded his Norton lecture series with a discussion on the “secret centers” of various literary works, ranging from “Moby Dick” to “Crime and Punishment.”
The Charles Eliot Norton Lectures have been a Harvard tradition since 1926 to spotlight “poetry in the broadest sense” and are now hosted by the Humanities Center.
As Pamuk took the podium, he playfully commented on the size of the audience.
“I spoke at Princeton many years ago to a crowd of barely 40. I’m happy to say that 22 years later, the crowd’s gotten a bit better,” Pamuk quipped.
Pamuk’s series this semester has attracted over 700 students, faculty, and Cambridge locals every lecture, the Humanities Center’s events coordinator Sarah M. Razor said. The novelist has sparked discussion among audience members about the experience of reading and writing novels.
“I believe the greatest height a novelist can attain is the ability to construct the form of the novel as an enigma,” Pamuk said. “Writing or reading a novel requires us to integrate all of our knowledge about the world.”
Audience members praised both the delivery and content of his lectures.“With his words, he got us to think deeply about the way that novels work,” Turkish studies professor Cemal Kafadar said. “And we can’t help but emerge from this experience with a greater appreciation of his works.”
Pamuk won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2006. The native of Istanbul is now a professor at Columbia University, where he teaches comparative literature and writing. His books have sold over seven million copies, and his statements on politics have generated much controversy, especially in Turkey.

Harvard Medical School kicked off a three-day symposium on breast cancer in the developing world yesterday afternoon.
The conference—also sponsored by the Harvard School of Public Health, the Harvard Global Equity Initiative, and several affiliate hospitals—engaged faculty, students, medical professionals, women’s health advocates, and health policy makers in discussions on finding ways to reduce breast cancer mortality rates and increase breast cancer awareness in poorer areas of the world.
“We believe that we have to get out the word that breast cancer is public health priority in the developing world,” said Felicia M. Knaul, an HMS Professor and Director of the Harvard Global Equity Initiative. “That’s a point that hasn’t come through in the literature and existing research.”
One of the goals of the symposium this week is to improve the education of women and medical personnel as well as the quality of treatment available to those diagnosed with breast cancer.
Lawrence N. Shulman, chief of general oncology at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, also stressed the importance of breast cancer awareness in the developing world. “Unless you have an educated public, women are never going to come for care because they’re not going to know what to look for,” he said.
During the conference, several other speakers referred to the rise of breast cancer in the developing world as the “unforeseen problem.” According to information packets distributed to symposium attendees, breast cancer is often viewed as a disease affecting only older women from wealthier, developed countries. “Breast cancer, left untreated, is a death sentence,” said Amy C. Sievers, a Dana Farber physician.
According to pamphlets distributed at the conference, the ratio of women who die from breast cancer to the total number of those diagnosed with it is below 0.23 in North America. This ratio is 0.354 in Latin America and the Caribbean and 0.7 in Africa.
Knaul said that to combat the inequality in cancer treatment between developed and developing nations, Harvard will launch the Task Force for Expanded Cancer Care and Control in the Developing World. The task force will draw its membership from HMS, HSPH, HGEI, and Dana Farber.
According to Knaul, the task force aims to reduce the cost of treatment drugs.
“We’re hoping to do what was done for AIDS for cancer,” she said.

A few minutes after midnight, the conversations of the 40 townspeople and 30 staff members in the Cambridge Senior Center quieted down.
After a four hour wait, the Cambridge Public School Committee election results were to be announced. The three candidates present, Patricia M. Nolan ’80, Alan R. Steinert, Jr. ’58. and Alice L. Turkel stood with the rest of the Cantabrigian present to hear the results.
The candidates were announced in order of decreasing vote count: Nancy Tauber, Richard N. Harding, Jr., Marc C. McGovern, Alfred B. Fantini, Nolan, Turkel, Joseph G. Grassi, Steinert, and Charles L. Stead, Sr.Of this list of nine, the first six are to seat the school committee for the next two years.
The turnout of 14,944 voters–an increase of nearly 1,500 votes from the last election—represents an anomaly to the recent trend of declining voter participation.
The results announced early this morning are considered “unofficial,” however, as the remaining 1017 ballots will be counted later today.
Although the final results have yet to be formally declared, it is unlikely that the election results will change, according to Ethridge King, one of the Cambridge election commissioners.
The voting scheme requires voters to initially rank their top six candidates in order to narrow the pool down to five. The candidate with the fewest number one rankings is eliminated and the ballots in favor of this candidate are redistributed to the voter’s second choice. The process is repeated until six candidates remain.  A final vote of 2135 is required in order to gain a seat in the school committee.
Stead was eliminated first, followed by Steinert and Grassi.
Current and former Cambridge School Committee members said they were surprised at Grassi’s elimination. “We always knew that one of us would lose—I just didn’t think Grassi would be one of them,” said Nolan.
John Hill, a senior member of the City of Cambridge, said she hoped the election results would create “transparency and power for the council.”
Like many others present in the room, she was optimistic towards the possibility for change in the dynamics of the school committee. “I’m hoping that we’ll have a radical result, perhaps some new members,” said Alan Dobson, another Cambridge resident.
A central issue in the election was the recent announcement of the Cambridge public school district’s failing test scores—despite spending $25,000 on each student.
“I don’t understand why our kids are not coming out with a competitive edge. It is definitely not the budget. It has to be the administration; it has to be the teachers; it has to be the committee,” said Saundra Granjin, a mother of five Cambridge Public School graduates. “They have to find a way to boost these kids’ confidence and get them more involved,” she added.
According to Robert Winters, creator of a website providing each candidate’s platform, “the school committee is not what’s going to turn it around. It’s the administration.”
With three women and two new members, the school committee’s dynamics will most likely be different from previous years, said Luc Schuster, a former member of the school committee.

In stark contrast to last year’s election, on-campus political clubs were generally inactive throughout Election Day yesterday, as the Harvard College Democrats were the only major political group to sponsor a phone campaign and a viewing party.
Last year, various Harvard organizations hosted events throughout Election Day, including the Democrats, the Harvard Republican Club, the Institute of Politics, and the Queer Students and Allies (then known as BGLTSA).
A number of undergraduate political leaders agreed that student interest was dampened this year due to the absence of major elections in all but a handful of states.
“People are generally sort of unaware that it’s Election Day,” said IOP President Mary K. B. Cox ’10. “It’s not even an off-year election, it’s an off-off year since there are only special elections and gubernatorial races.”
Harvard Republican Club President Colin J. Motley ’10 echoed that sentiment, saying, “I think the big difference between this year and last year is that people saw a lot of the races last year as having a direct impact on their lives.”
Harvard College Democrats President Eva Z. Lam ’10 said she agreed that student involvement was muted in this year’s elections, though she added that the Democrats chose to remain active over this election season in order to help maintain the momentum of their presidential victory last November.
“I never expected that people would get as worked up over Jon Corzine as they did over Barack Obama,” Lam said. “But I also think that it’s important for progressives to understand that you can’t just win one presidential election and have Obama wave a magic wand and make everything better.”
The Democrats sponsored their final phone bank yesterday evening in Adams House, with about fifteen volunteers rallying support in the gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia as well as the special congressional election in New York and the gay marriage referendum in Maine.
According to Evelyn R. Wenger ‘11, Campaigns Director for the Democrats, the volunteers focused most intensely on the Maine referendum, known as Proposition 1. The Democrats have been teaming up with the QSA to campaign against Prop 1 every Sunday for the past month. “Especially after Prop 8 passed last year and eliminated gay marriage in California, it’s definitely an important race,” Wenger said.
Following the phonebank, the Dems headed to Mather House to watch the election results come in lieu of their regular weekly meeting.

It may have been senior night for the Harvard field hockey team last night at Jordan Field, but it was the underclassmen who gave the Crimson an opportunity to win the game.
Down 4-2 to University of New Hampshire (12-6, 3-2 America East) in the second half, Harvard sophomores Carly Dickson and Allie Kimmel scored two goals in the match’s final 24 minutes to send the game into overtime.
Alas, the Harvard comeback would not be completed, as UNH scored a golden goal in just the 7th minute of overtime to give the Wildcats the 5-4 victory, dropping Harvard to 5-11 (2-4 Ivy) in the team’s final home game of the season.
“It’s a game I’ve sort of thought about since coming in as a freshman in preseason,” senior co-captain Elizabeth Goodman-Bacon said. “That was a great game to end on.”
Kimmel got the comeback started for the Crimson in the second half. After UNH goalie Katherine Nagengast strayed from her post to knock away a Harvard breakaway, Kimmel scooped up the ball and lobbed it over the goalie’s head to bring the Crimson within a single goal.
Dickson evened the score seven minutes later off a penalty corner. The sophomore received a pass from co-captain Kristin Bannon at the left side of the field. After tapping it to herself just feet in front of the circle, Dickson booted it past the Wildcats goalie for her second score of the game, knotting the score at four with less than 15 minutes remaining.
“They really put pressure on us,” UNH coach Robin Balducci said. “They really put us back on our heals.”
But tying the score would not put an end to Harvard’s worries. Before the end of regulation, the Crimson would be forced to withstand three penalty corners and a shot from UNH that forced Harvard goalie Cynthia Tassopoulos—who finished with eleven saves—to hit the turf to knock the ball away.
“Cynthia continues to hold the fort down back there,” Crimson coach Sue Caples said. “She’s learning how to command her circle.”
But Harvard’s strong defensive play at the end of regulation would not carry over into the extra period.
After a turnover at midfield, the Wildcats set up a breakaway. Meg Shea crossed the ball in front of the net for Whitney Frates, who tipped it past Tassopoulos for the game-winner in the seventh minute of overtime.
The Crimson might have been able to escape with a win, were it not for the team’s typically slow start. Harvard surrendered two goals in the game’s first six minutes, forcing the team to come from behind throughout the contest.
“As we continue to improve and grow as a team, we’ll settle into a game earlier and won’t be playing from behind the eight-ball in the first five minutes,” Caples said.
If going down 2-0 early were not bad enough, the Crimson’s leading scorer, junior Chloe Keating, left the game in the 13th minute with what appeared to be an injury to her right leg.
For a stagnant Harvard offense that had scored just four goals in its past three games, losing the junior forward and her .6 goals per contest appeared to be a bad sign.
But it was just when Keating went down that the Crimson offense stepped up. Instead of letting things spiral out of control—as happened in Harvard’s past three games—the Crimson got a spark from an unlikely source.
Freshman forward Nina Kucharczyk, a field hockey walk-on, notched her first goal of the season and her team’s first goal of the game in the 16th minute.
“I feel like I’m part of the team now,” said Kucharczyk, who was recruited to play lacrosse but joined an undermanned field hockey squad.
Almost as bizarre as Kucharczyk’s journey to the field hockey team was her first score. Just minutes before her goal, Kucharczyk heard a call from the Harvard sideline telling her to come out for a substitution.
As Kucharczyk ran over to the scorer’s table, a Crimson possession began to formulate and a coaching assistant yelled at Kucharczyk to remain on the field. Kucharczyk then sprinted toward the goal where Bannon had stolen the ball in front of the net. After Bannon’s shot was batted away by Nagengast, Kucharczyk collected the rebound and put away the score.
“I’m glad I didn’t come out when I saw supposed to,” Kucharczyk said with a smile.
Harvard would tie the score minutes later, this time in a more traditional manner. A string of crisp passes put the ball in the UNH semi-circle, where Harvard was able to earn its first penalty corner of the game.
Off the penalty corner, Sophomore Georgia McGillvray fed Dickson, who slapped it past the Wildcats goalie to even the score at two.
UNH would attempt to create separation from the Crimson again, scoring with less than two minutes left in the first half and then off a penalty corner just six minutes into the second frame.
But once again Harvard managed to claw its way back into the game, with the two goals from Dickson and Kimmel.
“I thought we did a great job of coming back and putting four goals in the net,” Tassopoulos said. “It’s just incredible after their scoring on us, especially so early.”
Unfortunately for the home team, it could not hold up in overtime. The defeat marks the Crimson’s fourth straight loss and seventh in the team’s last eight games. But after being outscored 23-4 in the squad’s previous three matches, last night’s overtime loss signaled an improvement.
“Coming off a couple tough games, I think we really picked it up,” Kimmel said. “Things were working out there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Kwaku Nyamekye has spent much of his Harvard soccer career as an unsung hero, helping to cement the Crimson back line during the last four years.
“For a defender to get recognition is a tough thing in soccer,” Harvard coach Jamie Clark said. “Shutouts are associated with goal keepers, and goals are associated with forwards. Defenders often don’t get the recognition they deserve.”
But this weekend, in a pivotal game against No. 21 Dartmouth (8-5-1, 3-2 Ivy), Nyamekye exploded into the spotlight, scoring an early goal for the No. 16 Crimson (11-3-1, 3-1-1) and making a goal-line save to protect the Harvard victory over the Big Green.
The goal came off of an assist from Adam Rousmaniere just 4:42 into play and could not have come at a better time or during a better game.
“The game against Dartmouth was huge,” Nyamekye said. “Getting a win was crucial for us in order to gain potential for an Ivy title.”
Besides providing the Crimson with an early-goal lead, the score also broke Nyamekye’s longest-scoring drought since his freshman year—one that dates back to Nov. 8, 2008 against Columbia.
“Scoring that goal definitely made me happy,” the senior said. “It was my first goal of the season and came during such an important game.”
His defensive save inside the penalty box in the waning minutes of the match evinced the skill Nyamekye has been developing since his freshman year.
“The goal-line save is a picture of Kwaku’s awareness and athleticism,” Clark said. “He was able to clear the ball off the line during a scramble and prevent a goal.”
Senior teammate and co-captain Brian Grimm was also not surprised by Nyamekye’s outstanding performance.
“Kwaku, in the last four years, has become one of the fiercest competitors in the conference,” Grimm said. “He had a great game defensively and had a big goal that got our offense started.”
The goal and save are examples of Nyamekye’s function on the Harvard squad as a dynamic, all-around player and his more recent responsibility as a team leader.
“We’ve had a young defensive line for the last seven games,” Clark said. “Kwaku has taken a real leadership role on his shoulders, providing strong defense when we need it...and being more vocal on the field.”
“Kwaku’s definitely the senior leader of our back line,” Grimm agreed. “He plays alongside a couple younger guys and really keeps them focused and prepared for every game.”
The senior’s leadership has been key in overcoming the setbacks Harvard has suffered this season—losses to the University of Connecticut, 4-0, on Oct. 14 and conference rival Princeton, 2-1, on Oct. 24.
“It’s tough to lose in Ivy competition,” Nyamekye said. “The loss against Princeton made our path to the Ivy title a little more difficult, but after each loss, we work a lot harder, so we don’t let a game slip like that again.”
The goal in mind now for Nyamekye and the Crimson team is the Ancient Eight championship, a prize that is at their fingertips following Brown’s loss to the University of Pennsylvania over the weekend.
“Luckily for us, Brown’s loss last weekend puts us back in the race for the Ivies,” Nyamekye said. “I feel like we’re back on track to capture the title.”
With only two games remaining in the regular season, back on track is exactly where Harvard needs to be.
“Honestly, we’re in control of our destiny here,” Clark said. “Unlike at the beginning of the year where there are so many games to focus on, now the finish line is in sight, and we only have to envision two wins.”
“We have plenty of motivation to be prepared for our next two games,” Grimm added, “because we know the magnitude and importance of each one.”
Despite some difficulty during the season, Nyamekye is optimistic about the final stretch.
“We definitely aren’t invincible,” the defender said. “But we have a lot to look forward to in the next few games.”
A title this year would carry special sentiment for Nyamekye and his senior teammates, who won the Ivies at the beginning of their careers.
“Kwaku and the seniors started their freshman year with an Ivy League title.” Clark said. “They would all like to bookend it with a win as seniors. This is their last chance...they want to go out as champions.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It used to be that a date with Cornell was a near-guaranteed win for the Harvard women’s hockey team. The Crimson had the Big Red’s number of late, winning 10 straight contests over the last three seasons—including sweeping Cornell out of the last two conference playoffs.
And when Harvard traveled to Ithaca last weekend, the cards seemed to be stacked in its favor. The Crimson was picked to finish second in the ECAC this year; the Big Red was expected to finish seventh. Plus Cornell’s biggest threat, forward Rebecca Johnston, is away from the team this season to train with the Canadian Olympic squad.
But this time, history didn’t repeat itself. Harvard took the ice at Lynah Rink and fell behind, 1-0. Every time the team fought back from a deficit, the Big Red would come back to seize control.
With three minutes to go in the game, Cornell senior Melanie Jue put the puck in the net and the last nail in the Crimson’s coffin. The Big Red skated off the ice with the 4-3 win—a victory that, combined with the team’s shutout of Dartmouth the night before, put Cornell in the national rankings for the first time in recent memory.
For the Big Red, the sweep of the powerhouse pair of Harvard and the Big Green was a historic event for a team that hasn’t finished with a winning record since the Clinton administration. For the Crimson, it was a sharp reminder that the ECAC is no longer its personal playground.
“I think the league’s going to be really strong,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said in a preseason interview. “It’s going to come from everywhere. Brown’s better than they were a year ago, Cornell’s continuing to get better, certainly…Clarkson’s off to a tremendous start.”
If anything, the opening weekend of ECAC play has proved Stone right. There are three conference teams in the national rankings right now, but only one—No. 7 St. Lawrence—was picked to finish in the top four in the league.
While Harvard, Dartmouth, and Princeton—predicted to finish second, third and fourth—are all receiving votes in the latest poll, it’s Clarkson that has provided the biggest surprise of the season so far.
After a disappointing season last year, the Golden Knights weren’t expected to do much better this winter. But Clarkson hosted then-No. 6 Boston College in the season’s opening weekend and came away with a win and a tie.
And from there, the victories just kept on coming. The Golden Knights took down three ranked teams—No. 4 New Hampshire, No. 8 Boston University, and St. Lawrence—in four days in late October, beating them all by at least three goals. Now 9-1-1, the Golden Knights moved up to No. 2 in the country on Monday.
For a conference that had been dominated by three teams for most of the decade—since the 2000-01 season, Harvard, Dartmouth and St. Lawrence have won every regular-season and tournament title but one—the increasing parity of the ECAC has been a long time coming.
The first hints of it rose up in early 2009. Princeton slipped past the Big Green in the regular-season standings, breaking up the Big Three for the first time since 2006. Then Rensselaer upset the Tigers in the first round of the playoffs, coming to Cambridge for its first championship weekend—and promptly upsetting the top-seeded Crimson for a place in the final game.
Harvard’s not the dominant team it has been for the last decade. For the first time since women’s hockey became an Olympic sport in 1998, no current Crimson player will be competing in the Games. Last year’s top three scorers are gone, and with only enough skaters to fill out three lines, Harvard’s going to have to rely heavily on defense and its seven rookies.
“Every team is different,” Stone said of this winter’s ECAC squads. “Some teams didn’t lose offensive punch, but they might be a little weaker defensively or in goal. I think the personality of each team is going to be unique. The key for us is going to be to stay healthy—with a small squad, to stay healthy, and to keep our game simple and get really good at what we do.”
It’s too early in the season to tell exactly what that Crimson personality is going to be. Defensive leadership, particularly from co-captains Cori Bassett and Kathryn Farni and senior netminder Christina Kessler, will likely guide the team. Junior Katharine Chute, the top returning scorer, has stepped up so far, with four points in the opening weekend, and she’ll need help from senior Anna McDonald and junior Kate Buesser to give the offense veteran production.
But as the Crimson searches for the style of play that will guide it to ECAC success, the squad will get quite the test in its first weekend at home. Clarkson and St. Lawrence are visiting Bright Hockey Center, and Harvard will have to figure things out fast to avoid falling in a 1-3 hole to start the season. But after being upset itself last week, the Crimson now has the chance to pull off the underdog win.
It might not be the easiest season for Harvard hockey, but the team has the experience and talent to skate with every team in the conference. And the increased competition in Eastern hockey can only improve the Crimson’s level of play.
Since the NCAA recognized women’s hockey as an official sport in 2001, a Midwestern team has won every national title. Now the top two teams in the country, and three of the top five, are programs from the East.
How Harvard stacks up against this competition remains to be seen. But though fans may long for the era when winning 20 games was nearly a guarantee, as a writer, I couldn’t be more excited to be along for what promises to be a fascinating ride.

Finding appropriate places to meet up for group studying can be notoriously difficult on campus. Libraries do not permit talking, Lamont Cafe and dhalls can be obnoxiously crowded and loud, and available classrooms are few and far between. However, the Harvard library system has come up with a potential answer to this problem: the Collaborative Learning Space in Lamont B-30, which opened today.
"It's an idea that the library had and was thinking about for quite a while, through surveying students and library users, we realized there was a need for a learning space,  a group study space that was different from the kind of space we were offering," says Harvard College Library Spokeswoman Beth Brainard.
Curious about this shiny new resource? Read on after the jump.
The CLS, a surprisingly large space, consists mostly of a few tables surrounded by chairs. However, these are no ordinary tables--each is made up of three petal-shaped mini tables on wheels that can be moved around into any desired configuration. Wheels are also a feature of most of the room's chairs. The room is further equipped with two projectors and screens, several wheel-y whiteboards, and a TV with DVD player (score!).
The CLS will sometimes be used as class space; however, when it is not booked (a calender is easily accessible outside the door or on the HCL website), it is open for student use. The door is open M-F from 8:30 AM to 9 PM, and after hours or on weekends, it can be accessed by anyone with a valid HUID.
HCL's official press release about the Collaborative Learning Space can be found here.

Hanging out with your professor or teaching fellow isn’t the average student's idea of fun. But that didn't stop the class of 2013 from making an evening of it.
The First-Year Faculty Dinner has been a tradition at Harvard for many years. The dinner is billed as an excellent opportunity to get to know your professor or TF or preceptor on a more personal level than a 200-person lecture allows. But last night, it appeared that neither the students nor their guests knew quite what to do with themselves when they arrived at the Queen’s Head Pub for the 5 p.m. reception.
Here’s how the typical pair's evening kicked off:
Student stands by herself, anxiously looking around to try to find her professor. She spots him.
Student: “Hi!!! Professor _______. How are you?”
Professor: “Hi. Sorry, remind me of your name again? (After response) Good to see you!”
They proceed to the doors of the pub. They both pause to silently debate whether they should open the door. After one of them does, both again ponder whether they should enter first. They enter, wait around for the line to the cheese and crackers to thin out...
More awkwardness, after the jump.
How did the attendees describe the anticipated dinner?
“Smiley,” one student said. “A lot of smiling, nodding, and listening to [my professor] talk.”
“Stimulating,” replied an academic adviser while waiting for her advisee to show up.
Of course, the night played out differently for everyone. A few athletes invited their crew coach. A handful of students said they had wanted to invite their professors but later found out they have already been asked by other students, so they were forced to go with a second choice. It kind of reminded FlyBy of high school prom, except, instead of that cute guy in math class...

Somehow, Halloween and Harvard grad students just don't seem to go together.
Earlier this week, after what his lawyer suggested was a night of Halloween revelry, a Harvard Law School student was arrested for allegedly setting fire to a chapel that contained, we kid you not, the remains of 9/11 victims. From today's Crimson:
Schroeder—whom The New York Daily News branded as “New York’s newest Public Enemy #1”—was arrested on counts of third degree arson, first degree reckless endangerment, second degree criminal mischief, and third degree burglary, according to the New York Police Department.
Schroeder was reportedly drunk at the time of the incident, and Schroeder’s attorney has claimed to media outlets that his client may have been drugged during a night of partying over Halloween weekend.
As if that weren't bad enough, the B School had its own run-in with the police,when a student party at the Boston night club Tequila Rain evidently got a little out of hand:
The male suspect grabbed a police officer by the neck as he was being escorted away from the club, according to the police report.
The report also said that the female suspect, claiming to be a citizen of Lebanon, accused police of racism and attempted to take photographs of the altercation, saying “This is going to get us a lot of money.”
Oh boy. Where's DAPA when you need them?

With Harvard unwilling to allow film crews on campus, the staff of the new Facebook movie "The Social Network" opted for Johns Hopkins University as the setting for the undergrad days of site creator and erstwhile Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg.
But now, the Baltimore Sun reports, some on the Baltimore campus are up in arms over the decision. Students created a Facebook group encouraging others to wear Hopkins paraphernalia in hopes that some of it might make it onto movie screens. From the Sun,
That'll show them!
But another student quoted in the Baltimore Sun article took a more cynical outlook.

They say you can't eat just one. Well, in Adams tonight, you'll be able to eat six—types of potato chips, that is.
Kelly A. Evans '10, the Food Literacy Project representative in Adams House, is hosting a potato chip buffet tonight featuring six different types of Cape Cod potato chips and a bunch of different kinds of dips, everything ranging from the typical French onion to one with clams. She said that she got the idea from a blockmate "who really likes chips," and that this features chips produced locally in Hyannis, Mass.
It starts tonight at 9 p.m. in Adams Dining Hall.
