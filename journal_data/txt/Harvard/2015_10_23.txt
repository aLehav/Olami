After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Grotesque sex, an apartment filled with suicidal screams, schoolchildren hanging one another. If one prefers to stay within the bounds of the everyday, do to Lincoln Michel’s collection of short stories what any sensible person would a blood-spitting, brain-eating monster: Turn away and run. “Upright Beasts” is not for the faint of heart; Michel’s language drips with the eeriness of cold-blooded murder; each story casts a fluorescent light upon the dissolution of human companionship, the disintegration of community, and decomposition of self. However, this effect is severely diminished by his dry storytelling. His stories, while each momentarily interesting as single pieces, are repetitive as a whole. They bleed into one another with each turn of the page, rendering the overall work blurred and amorphous.
One of the most problematic elements of the book is apparent at first glance: its bizarre thematic structure. An assemblage of individual apologues, “Upright Beasts” is already strange in that it lacks a physical, geographical, or otherwise tangible unifying quality. The book is broken into four parts—“Upright Beasts,” “North American Mammals,” “Familiar Creatures” and “Megafauna,” titles that seem indistinguishable in the context of the general theme of bestiality, and therefore needlessly cryptic. Each section in turn contains anywhere from three to eight short stories and each of these stories varies in length—some are as short as two pages while others are as long as 15. This structure is mirrored by Michel’s narrative layering. As the book progresses, certain key phrases and ideas—watchful eyes, abandoned homes, characters as deformed as the monsters’ bodies which they inhabit—recur to the point of impotence. While initially interesting by virtue of shock value, the text loses its sickly charm by the time it reaches “Things Left Outside,” a later story; a desensitizing effect sets in after one to0 many cheating spouses and murderous plans. The very nature of Michel’s repetition works against him as it dulls the sustainment of emotional impact.
This lack of distinction between pieces also manifests itself in Michel’s characterization—none of the crafted identities are particularly memorable, and each storyline glides past the preceding one like water sliding past itself. John Does and dictators alike speak in the same listless, unwavering tone as they [a) suspect their wives or b) murder their neighbors or c) fall victim to a bloodthirsty mob. Michel’s descriptions of characters seem deliberately unembellished, slicing to the meat of each situation, yet the monotonous violence of this technique renders character identities unmemorable among stories. Unlike a well-planned book, the collection reads as scattered, without the grounding roots of character development or inter-story relations.
None of this is to discount each story’s standalone intrigue. Thanks in large part to the author’s generous use of graveyard humor, serious situations are passed off as silly and difficult questions are raised in casual conversation, effectively dissolving boundaries between human entities and their human and non-human surroundings. This breaking—or rather breakdown—of physical, societal, and internal relations seems to be of primary importance in “Upright Beasts.” Physically, children act like adults in real-life games of hangman; socially, politicians literally buy favors with gold keys; emotionally, a person finds himself committing wicked acts in the name of love and artificial intelligence. Thus children play-act as adults, adults imitate children, neighbors become enemies, enemies stay neighbors; in this manner, Michel’s stories are loosely related by their unsettling, chaotic mutations of a technologized, mechanized world where, hypothetically, order should reign. Occasionally, Michel’s matter-of-fact storytelling style aids him in capturing a reader’s fleeting attention. Surprisingly insightful thoughts like “we’d been together for long enough it felt like nothing at all” spring from the mouths of the aforementioned two-dimensional, dull characters. Embedded in the larger context of obscure phrases, these short statements and certain individual stories demand a second glance.
Ultimately, “Upright Beasts” can be reduced to the conundrum within its first story, “Our Education.” In the piece, children who have overthrown school authorities eventually forget that their teachers, school bus rides, and homework ever existed in the first place. Elements of the past are erased in the name of progress. Similarly, in Michel’s worlds, while greater society, communities, and people themselves flirt with misguided notions of success and power, they forget to confront what he portrays as the more important questions: What is companionship? What constitutes a community? How do humans understand and fail to understand themselves? Instead of answering directly, Michel creatively presents his views—albeit in overly disconnected, redundant fashion with stories are better standalone than lumped together—through people, animals, and actions so distorted that they inevitably expose the insensibility of social constructs by their contrast with known reality. By the end of “Upright Beasts,” however, Michel’s writing stumbles over its own overarching questions of identity and relationship, never quite finding the balance to stand.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Performing in character in her music videos is no new practice for artist Lana Del Rey. Whether she’s portraying a broken performer turned biker babe in “Ride” or simultaneously channeling Marilyn Monroe and Jackie Kennedy in “National Anthem,” she never fails to bring the characters she embodies to life, imbuing each one with a touch of her own persona.
While Lana draws many of her characters from more contemporary inspirations, in her new video for “High By The Beach,” she throws it back to childhood, brilliantly re-imagining and subverting the traditional children’s story of “Goldilocks and the Three Bears.” We all know the tale: A beautiful, young girl wanders into an empty house in the forest. Upon entering, she finds three bowls of porridge—one too hot, one too cold, and one that is just right, which she consumes in its entirety. She then finds three chairs of varying sizes, breaking the chair she likes best. Finally, she finds three beds and falls asleep in her favorite one. Just then, the family of three bears that owns the house returns, discovering their home burglarized and their belongings tampered with. The story ends when they find Goldilocks still asleep in the bed. As they stand over her, watching her sleep and discussing her presence in their home, she awakes and, terrified, runs into the woods never to be seen again. While melding fables with the lyrics and stylings of self-described “gangsta Nancy Sinatra” is certainly a daunting task, genius and visionary Lana Del Rey achieves the marriage seamlessly.
0:21


From the video’s opening shots, Lana clues us in to the fact that the house she is alone in is indeed meant to symbolize the house of the three bears. Using a three-storied home as her setting, she subtly hints to the residents of the home that she occupies and the story’s other three characters: Papa Bear, Mama Bear, and Baby Bear.

0:46


She even introduces us to the bears, represented by a metaphorical helicopter that hovers outside her window, watching her move from floor to floor as the video progresses. A clear shout out to the voyeuristic character of the bears (who watch Goldilocks as she sleeps), the helicopter becomes Lana’s ever-watching antagonist.
1:13


Of course, using just the three-storied empty house and the symbolic bear family vis à vis the helicopter is not enough for expert storyteller Lana Del Rey. Fully embodying her character, she reenacts Goldilocks’ classic discovery of the beds. As she lies down on a mattress on the top floor of the house, rolling around and eventually rising in dissatisfaction, she perfectly reproduces the reaction Goldilocks must have had when the bed she found was just too soft. It’s an artistic feat that may very well have failed in the hands of a less experienced performer, but Lana’s portrayal is nothing short of stunning.
1:54


Lana quickly follows this by paying homage to the famous porridge scene. Descending to the house’s second floor, she discovers the morning coffee, now far too cold to be enjoyed. The coffee serves as a stand in for the mature woman’s porridge, and Lana, already old and wise to the effect of time and temperature on a mug of coffee, doesn’t even have to taste it to declare that the coffee is too cold. Unfortunately, as is so often the case in real life, there is no coffee available that is just right.
3:19


Perhaps it is this lack of acceptable coffee left behind by the bears that finally leads Lana to take on her enemy. With the helicopter overhead, she runs out over the rocky beach, retrieving a mysteriously placed guitar case from behind a jagged stone.
3:53


However, we quickly discover that this is no mere guitar case but instead one that holds a bazooka. Suddenly we see Lana in her element, taking a classic character and making it gritty and entirely her own. As she diverges from the classic literature, she creates a space for her unique interpretation of Goldilocks to rise, stomping out the previous ingenue.
4:02


This gangster Goldilocks is not playing around. Unlike her predecessor, she doesn’t run screaming into the forest, never to be seen again, when it’s time to confront the enemy. Instead, Lana’s Goldilocks fires her bazooka directly into the helicopter, metaphorically destroying the bears and laying claim to their home.
4:08


As the helicopter goes down, flaming bits of newspaper float through the air, representative of the pages of the children’s story Lana has simultaneously dismantled and recreated.
4:17


Bazooka held proudly, Lana has officially become the new Goldilocks, forever changing the narrative, shaping it in her own unique and violent form of feminine empowerment. Now she is free to do whatever she pleases. Hopefully, after being disappointed by the bed and the coffee, she’ll find the bears’ stash to be just right, leading to an afternoon of what she’s sought after all along—simply getting high by the beach.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My mom loves to tell the story about what she has labeled my “first protest.” I was a toddler, and I had just learned how to write my letters in the correct direction. I was a very serious kid. One night, my brother and my mom were playing on our kitchen floor and I was too tired for fun like that. My mother tells me that in a quiet rage, I snatched a sheet of paper that I had been using to practice my writing. I wrote “BED” on it, marching solemnly and silently around the room. I don’t doubt it. What a radical feminist origin story.
She laughed as she retold this story to me last summer. “I just remember you marching in, with this little stern face, interrupting our fun like you were the parent or something, Bri!” Maybe I understood that to voice my interests, I needed to interrupt those who were oblivious to them.
It was a summer of interruptions. #BlackLivesMatter activists interrupted Bernie Sanders during Netroots Nation and at a rally in Seattle. Undocumented activist Jennicet Gutiérrez interrupted President Obama during a White House LGBT reception. My peers interrupted me as I tried to explain why these acts of protest were not bad things.
The beauty of protests is that they are thoroughly contingent upon others’ reactions. #BlackLivesMatter activists were attacked for challenging Sanders on his proposed policies. Gutiérrez was booed by the other guests at the White House. Protests are actually really great for highlighting the ugliness of bystanders’ immediate reactions.
Yes, I said ugliness. My heart broke when Jennicet Gutiérrez dared to challenge the president. I was so hurt to see a transgender woman of color put her immigration status on the line to speak out against violence in detention centers, only to be met with rejection from her own community. I didn’t have the words to explain my anger at the Bernie Sanders supporters who completely invalidated the protests of #BlackLivesMatter groups at Netroots and in Seattle. I hated the fact that the white liberals who hopped on the hashtag bandwagon when it was trendy were now the white liberals who hated the movement for black lives.
People love to complain about hecklers, but they’re missing something major. For individuals like Jennicet Gutiérrez and #BlackLivesMatter organizers—people without access to the power that leaders like President Obama and Senator Sanders have been given—there are no other nonviolent ways to get your voice heard. These are the voices facing life-threatening situations every day in this country, but they’re also the voices that are easiest to ignore—the voices that will never get elected to any office, let alone the presidency. America can claim to be the land of the free and the brave, but democracy has its limits. An undocumented transgender Latina is not going to get elected anytime soon.
It’s undeniable that these kinds of interruptions make us uncomfortable. But why? I understand that respect matters, but I also want to acknowledge that we condition children with conflicting messages. Speak up when something’s wrong! Respect those with more power (read: more whiteness, more wealth, more richness, more political authority)! Aren’t we the experts of our own experience? If so, why are we being legislated without the inclusion of our own perspectives in the political conversation?
To their credit, Senator Sanders and President Obama were responsive to these protests, enacting policy changes that addressed protesters’ concerns. That does not excuse their treatment of the protesters, or the reaction of the bystanders in these crowds. I have so many questions for the individuals who were upset or angered by the disruptions in their exclusive, precious time with a president and a presidential candidate. Innocent transgender people and people of color are getting murdered at ridiculous rates. Undocumented immigrants hard at work chasing the elusive American dream are getting deported or placed in dangerous detention centers. But a gala or a speaking event are sacred spaces of respectability. Okay.
People love to frame figures like President Obama and Senator Sanders as ‘revolutionaries.’ But when I think of ‘revolution,’ I think of voices that were silenced by others within the movement. Sylvia Rivera, a transgender woman active in multiple social movements of the 1970s, took the stage at a Gay Liberation rally in 1973. “I’ve been trying to get up here all day, for your gay brothers and your gay sisters in jail!” she exclaims in a video recording. I hear the booing and the jeers in the background, listening to someone from the crowd shout “Shut up!” as Rivera tries to speak. I wonder if this would happen today. Or did it already happen? Marriage equality doesn’t do much for an incarcerated or undocumented queer or transgender person. A white dude who did some civil rights work in the 1960s doesn’t mean anything to the black lives on the line today. Instead of pretending like the problems are solved, maybe people in power should listen to those without it.
I guess what I’m trying to drive home is the idea that in the U.S., not everyone gets a voice like Obama’s. Instead of forcing our tokenized black people and transgender people to silently take a seat at the table, why not encourage them to speak up? Why not get the perspectives of the populations for whom you’re trying to create policy? We can’t expect them to “lean in” (whatever that means) if we don’t even acknowledge the challenging conditions of so many of their daily lives. We can’t continue to demonize meaningful protest moments as heckling if we want to advance progressive politics. Every movement needs a revolutionary—but maybe that revolutionary isn’t a politician. Maybe that’s okay.

This past Sunday, when temperatures descended below 40 and the “real-feel” was colder than freezing, I refused to wear my winter coat. In protest of Cambridge’s weather system, which fails to segue from fall to winter with any finesse, I sported a leather jacket and acted as if the cold front wasn’t an affront to my happiness.
I accessorized with an iced tea.
I felt rebellious.
I am not ready for winter. Whereas the colorful leaves and crispy breeze of fall rejuvenate and reenergize me, biting cold and disorienting snows tend to have the opposite effect. 

I knew what I had to do: If I was happier in the autumn than in winter, I needed to dress like it was still autumn. Unsurprisingly, given what we know about clothing and  embodied cognition, it actually did cause a positive shift in my mood!
I will state the obvious: I didn’t shock anyone by eschewing wool with reckless abandon. I certainly didn’t compromise my safety. And most importantly, I was fighting nature, and thus, the most drastic change that I could hope to provoke was my own mood shift. But if I could do that with a piece of outerwear, I wondered what sartorial choices others could make that have much greater ramifications? Can productive, concrete rebellions be fought by means of fashion?
Enter Jennicet Guttiérez, a transgender activist who hosted a meeting on Monday to raise awareness about the mistreatment of detained BGLTQ immigrants in the United States. Originally from Mexico, Gutiérrez left her country to escape its trans-phobic culture.
Initially born male, Jennicet explained how she felt strongly as a child that she should be female. Immediately, I began to think about the fashion-related implications of this. In Mexico, where it’s largely considered unacceptable to question or change one’s gender, Jennicet’s journey towards self-discovery happened behind closed doors. Specifically, at her friend’s house, where Jennicet was encouraged to try on women’s clothes. In these moments when she donned a dress and heels, Jennicet felt most at home in her then-male body.
But Jennicet’s family forbade her from cross-dressing. This lack of support was coupled with the alarming stream of news about murders of transgender people in her country. For Jennicet, then a male who wanted to wear women’s clothes, the choice to dress as she pleased would have been a concrete rejection of the trans-phobic ideology that permeated her culture. It would be an act of bravery as well as a jeopardizing choice. It would be the most eloquent wordless statement she could make.
Being cis-gendered, I can’t genuinely make the same statements as Jennicet. But if she can use her clothing to say, “I’m happiest as a woman, even though I was born a man,” is there a way that I can dress to support her? To say, “I’m happy if she’s happy. I promote non-conformity.”
Part of the solution is speaking in proper context. Currently, those with access to the most eloquent, expansive, and recognized forum for fashion innovation are the haute couturiers and emerging designers that showcase their work at global fashion weeks. The high fashion runway has come to be a place where viewers prefer to see impractical creativity over measured functionality, which gives rise to a parade of utterly innovative outfits featuring “roller-skate flatform” shoes or human backpacks.
In turn, this unadulterated experimentation that’s expected on the runway trickles down into the designs that we wear daily. Recently, an overwhelming move towards androgyny both in design and model recruitment on the haute-couture runway reflects a major shift in the tectonics of gender-specific fashion design. Skirts for men, initially seen on the runway, have infiltrated the streets thanks to Kanye West and Jared Leto among others. Simply by wearing this silhouette that has previously been denied to them, men claim their right to self-expression dissociated from the outdated binary understanding of gender.
Rei Kawakubo of fashion label Comme des Garçons—French for “Like Some Boys”—produces provoking, avant-garde, and extremely innovative agendered work. But her approach to promoting gender equality is less literal than the endeavor to appropriate classically feminine garments to men. Instead, she designs for the woman “who is not swayed by what her husband thinks.”
Kawakubo once said, “I never intended to start a revolution. I only came to Paris with the intention of showing what I thought was strong and beautiful. It just so happened that my notion was different from everybody else’s.”  Indeed, Kawakubo has completely revolutionized fashion design. She pays special attention to the ways in which the fashion industry often unfairly uses clothes to “package” women in tight, revealing, hyper-sexualized getups. In response, her designs sometimes mimic voluminous bundles of fabric and often can be fastened onto the body in many different ways, providing women with an alternative type of self-packaging.
As crazy and un-wearable as all of that sounds, Comme des Garçons has an obsessive consumer following. I often spy jackets with this telltale Kawakubo whimsy on the streets of New York City, and I always enjoy watching the head-turns and intrigued attention that they elicit.
Though my leather jacket cannot change nature, a Kawakubo garment can change how we think about gender norms. And when the fashion industry boldly tackles social issues like this through thoughtful design, it supports the brave rebellions like Jennicet’s, those that represent the beginnings of a necessary shift in our values.

The last few months have witnessed a number of conflicting developments in gun control legislation. This month, California signed a bill that bans concealed weapons on school and college campuses; this comes in sharp contrast to the Texas legislature’s decision in June to legalize the carrying of concealed guns at public and private universities. The recent mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon has heightened the tensions surrounding the debate over gun control, especially regarding the presence of guns on college campuses. The decisions by the California and Texas governments demonstrate the two conflicting modes of thought: Some argue that the solution to gun-related violence is more guns, whereas others champion more stringent gun control measures.
That such a debate exists about the right to carry guns on campuses is appalling: Schools and universities are clearly and undoubtedly better off without guns. Schools are places of intellectual and social development where civic duties and vocational skills are imparted through discourse and dialogue. Guns heighten distrust and tension among students and faculty—such a fearful atmosphere is not conducive to learning and intellectual growth. Following the Texas decision to permit concealed carry in campus, one professor commented that he would resign his post because he would not feel safe in his classroom. It is a disgrace that we have been reduced to this debate. The fact that we even have to confront such a question is indicative of the magnitude of the gun problem in this country.
Guns cannot be exonerated from guilt in tragic incidents like the one that just took place in Oregon. Though it is true that people commit these crimes, it is the ubiquity of guns that encourages and provokes these incidents; to solely blame individuals is complacent and misguided. As President Obama mentioned in his impassioned speech following the Oregon shooting, the US is not the only country with mental health issues and gaming culture, but it is the sole nation where mass-shootings have become routine and commonplace
It is sad that we in this nation must have this discussion about guns repeatedly, with no resolution while innocent lives continue to be taken with frightening regularity. Despite the many gun-related tragedies, there has been little done to limit the availability of guns; the fear of some gun supporters that any gun control law will strip them of their civic liberties and freedom is delusional. Their paranoia points to nothing less than an idolization of guns—one that is unhealthy on a personal level and harmful on a national scale. It is disheartening that these prejudices and irrational fears have prevented a healthy discourse on gun control. In even having a debate over the presence of guns in schools, we have completely missed the forest for the trees: The answer should be obvious.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Thursday, the Harvard Israel Initiative at Harvard Hillel took a position that pierced the delicate fabric of diverse and hopefully welcoming communities at Harvard. By inviting a commanding an officer from Operation Protective Edge, Israel’s offensive on Gaza last summer, to speak, Hillel and HII estranged the community of Harvard Palestinians, friends, and family on this campus. Beyond the realm of freedom of speech and diverse discourse, this event brought an individual who was behind the line of fire that targeted members of our community, creating an environment that is unwelcoming, exclusive, and even threatening.
This will not be the first article you see about the back-and-forth of pro-Palestinian or pro-Israeli events and what they mean for our campus, but I ask this campus to consider the dimension of this particular event that should cause us to question the limits of “free discourse” on this campus while we simultaneously seek to create a safe space for our incredibly and beautifully diverse communities at Harvard.
In the summer of 2014, the Israeli military launched “Operation Protective Edge,” an offensive that ended the lives of around 2,200 people: Over 500 were children, and nearly 300 were women. Meanwhile, many Harvard students with family and friends in Gaza and the West Bank were horrified to hear the news each day, but frantic to get ahold of the most recent stories. While Gaza has been under siege for eight years and stories of the humanitarian crisis are not unfamiliar, this offensive was particularly violent.
I was a student at Harvard Summer School in Jerusalem that summer; I felt suffocated by an environment that could not face the number of deaths—and the larger number of broken families—without a political framework that merited them less weight and humanity. The politics warranted less pull on people’s consciousnesses for the deaths just 20 miles away, but when once or twice we went to bomb shelters because a siren alerted that a rocket was in the vicinity (deflected soon by an Iron Dome over our heads), the politics on this side of the geopolitical line gave us more right to be scared, express emotions, and not have our reality of danger be conditioned and exceptionalized—and not have our humanity be curtailed by politics.
No, discourse is not fair when it comes to Israel-Palestine. What else is new? They say the first victim of war is the truth. But on our campus, beyond losing truth, we cannot also lose a climate that is safe for all of its members. We cannot bring the unfair power dynamics of that conflict to this campus and call it “fair discourse.” We must represent our views to each other through speakers and scholars who are not complicit in the destruction of our peers or peers’ families and friends.
At the end of the day, the position of Hillel was to maintain that they were providing a voice that members of their community are interested in hearing. Hillel and many of its members are invested in Israel, and hearing from an Israeli soldier is a perspective they find important and necessary. However, for us Palestinians and those in solidarity, this event is not a matter of discourse on campus and hearing different perspectives—there is ample opportunity for that. Instead, Palestinians on this campus had to contend with facing someone who had a gun pointed at friends and family in another context. That is not equal footing; that is a discourse of oppressive and intimidating power dynamics. It is an expression of privilege that people at Hillel in support of this event can speak to the commander and ask questions, seeing themselves in an academic discourse or dissociated from the conditions and context of what this commanding officer represents and is. Palestinians and friends on campus cannot be expected to partake in that conversation while knowing that the person they are speaking to is actively engaged in a military operation that occupies their land and oppresses and kills their people. We should not be asked to face a soldier who, regardless of engagement in dialogue and affiliation with a member of the Harvard community, would nonetheless administer violent action against us as Palestinians.
The Palestine Solidarity Committee, of which I am a part, felt compelled to express dissent to this event because it is our role on campus to represent the voices of Palestinian students and rights of Palestinians in one of the world’s most well-known and divisive conflicts. However, we wanted to be respectful of Hillel and its importance to many students in the Harvard community and to be clear that any dissent that we expressed was explicitly against the particular event being held rather than against Hillel itself. To this end, we reached out to Dean Khurana and got in touch with Dean Lassonde, as well as with the Harvard University Police Department, to make sure that what we were planning was as respectful and unobtrusive as possible. With Dean Lassonde’s and HUPD’s approval, we decided to hold a die-in outside of Hillel and compose letters for the general Harvard community and for Hillel’s leadership to express our sincere intentions. Now, we ask the campus community to question the place of events such as these in a campus that must include and account for all of us.
The die-in represented and remembered those who died in last summer’s offensive in which Gedalia Gillis was a commanding officer. Our members and supporters laid down on the sidewalk outside of Hillel, leaving room for people to enter and exit Hillel as well as pass by, while one of us read out the names of those who died in Gaza. Others of us distributed the letters to passersby and Hillel community members explaining our position and the purpose of our event. Hillel leaders and members may contend that Gillis was the sibling of one of their members, that we may have been able to attend the event and engage in a discussion with Gillis, but to do so would have been to take part in a discourse that normalizes our vulnerability and disadvantage with the mask of “dialogue.” We believe that by respectfully expressing a dissenting perspective outside of Hillel, our die-in created a dialogue that could take place, and in fact did take place, on a more even playing field. Multiple students supportive and unsupportive of the event stopped to partake in a discussion with us, which we gratefully engaged in.
Afterwards, I stood to speak with Rabbi Jonah, as I have on a number of other occasions, including when planning Muslim-Jewish dialogue last year with my friend and the President of Hillel, Elena Hoffenberg. Rabbi Jonah has expressed that he and many others at Hillel maintain that the event played a necessary role for them and that we could have engaged with questions to the speaker. I do not expect events such as these to alter deeply entrenched perspectives on the conflict. However, I ask the campus community to answer if it would be fair to ask me and other Palestinians and allies on campus to engage in polite questioning of a military commander who led an offensive against our family and friends last summer, killing over 1,400 civilians. At that point, in honoring this soldier’s place on our campus, we would have already forgotten the broken homes and families in Gaza and outside of it. No. At least outside of Israel, Palestinians will have a place to speak free from the power dynamics that consider us less human in a political game that has displaced us and our humanity from the start. At least at Harvard we will ask for our humanity to be respected, and not eclipse recent violence or long-remembered stories of displacement that is the Palestinian narrative and reality.

U.S. Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus highlighted his efforts to reduce the incidence of sexual assault in the military to students, government officials, and veterans gathered to hear him speak at Harvard Law School on Thursday.
“We have to fix it, or the fabric that holds together our military will fray,” Mabus said. “I think we’re doing a lot of good things. But we’re not there yet.”
During his tenure,  Mabus has worked to promote gender equality in the Navy. He expanded paid maternity leave from six weeks to 18 weeks, made the decision to allow women to serve on submarines, and is currently working to make male and female uniforms the same.
“A more diverse force is a stronger force,” Mabus said. “The more different kinds of viewpoints you have, the better the force.”
His speech, held as part of a lecture series organized by the Disabled American Veterans group, also touched on issues with services for veterans.
Forty percent of wounded soldiers during World War II died, according to Mabus, compared to just 11 percent today. “What that means is that people are surviving much larger and more awful injuries,” he said. “They’re going to need more rehab, more assistance, more help.”
He pointed to the growth of employment opportunities for veterans in the Navy, which has hired 70,000 veterans for non-combat roles since 2011. Under his direction, the Navy has also implemented transition programs to help veterans adjust to civilian life.
As Secretary of Navy, Mabus has also expanded the Career Intermission program, which allows Navy sailors to take time off from service, and reduced the Navy’s costs. The Navy saved $2 billion last year on its $17.8 billion contract for 10 new attack submarines.
“We’re getting 10 submarines but we’re paying for nine,” Mabus said. “It’s like getting one of those cards: Buy nine subs, get one free.”
Dean of the Law School Martha L. Minow praised Mabus and the Disabled American Veterans group for their efforts in helping veterans across the country and for their participation in events like Thursday’s.
“Their commitment to raising awareness about the needs of veterans inspires us all,” Minow said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although some Harvard students from local areas are aware of the main issues in the upcoming Cambridge City Council election, most are not intimately acquainted with the candidates and their positions. Instead, they are more concerned with the Harvard-related issues they consider more relevant to their daily lives, they said.
“I’d say very few kids from Cambridge have any idea what's going on. I knew like two kids from my high school that followed local government,” said Benjamin F. S. Altshuler ’19, who is from Cambridge.
“As a student, I don’t really care [about the City Council],” said Conor R. Paterson ’16, who grew up in Cambridge and added that few of the issues decided by the City Council affect Harvard students. “The only reason I think about [the election] is because I live here.”
Cambridge residents in general are unsure of the relevance of the City Council elections, according to Paterson. They are scheduled for Nov. 3.
“The whole City Manager thing makes you wonder what the City Council really does,” Paterson said. “The real boss is the City Manager.” Cambridge citizens elect the nine members to the Council who then appoint the City Manager. The last City Manager served for 32 years.
Candidates have been campaigning heavily in recent months, and Harvard students from Cambridge have been inundated by campaign materials. “I've gotten mailings; mostly they go to recycling,” Altshuler said.
Still, some Harvard Cantabrigians said they have considered important campaign issues.
“Locally I would say traffic and congestion is a big issue,” Amy R. Zhao ’19 said.
Paterson emphasized other concerns. “The thing mostly on people’s radar is zoning,” he said. “With the tech business in Kendall Square, there’s a lot of building and development going on for the people who work there.”
But Harvard, he said, remains at the center of students’ lives. “Students live on Harvard property, go to school on Harvard property,” Paterson said.
According to Zhao, when students look beyond the gates of Harvard, they focus on issues of a national or global scale.
“We are either concerned with Harvard or concerned with bigger things—like presidential elections,” she said. “I guess kids aren’t that interested in local things.”
For his part, Altshuler will not be joining other Cantabrigians at the polls come November.
“I'm much more directly affected by the issues at Harvard,” he said. “Here, your voice is more easily heard.”
Those registered to vote in Cambridge can go to the polls for the City Council election on Nov. 3. This year, 23 candidates will vie for nine spots on the Council.

In an hour long question and answer session at Harvard Law School on Thursday, United States Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy discussed a breadth of topics ranging from his time on the Court, concepts of dignity and freedom, and his own time as a student at the Law School.
Kennedy also reflected on the role of the judge and Constitution in American life, at one point brandishing a copy of the document he had in his jacket pocket.
Kennedy has been a justice on the Supreme Court since 1988. Over the summer, he wrote the majority opinion in the Obergefell v. Hodges, extending the right to same-sex marriage in every state, an outcome that several Law School professors predicted earlier in the year. Often considered to be the deciding or “swing” vote on the nine-member judicial body, Kennedy joked about the term on Thursday, saying he didn’t like its sense of “spatial gyration.”
“The cases swing, I don’t. Thank you for not including that,” Kennedy said to laughs. Kennedy is also the longest actively serving faculty member at the McGeorge of School of Law at the University of the Pacific.
Dean of the Law School Martha L. Minow, who moderated the discussion, eventually opened up the event to questions from members of the packed crowd in Milstein Hall; Kennedy answered questions on campaign finance laws and recommended reading material, including Franz Kafka’s “The Trial.”
When Minow asked him what he had learned as a Law School student, Kennedy again turned to humor to describe his studious days as a student.
“I remember a lot of the cases I had in Law School better than cases I’ve worked with,” Kennedy said to laughs.
Later in the discussion, Kennedy turned to more specific legal and judicial questions. He called solitary confinement “an ongoing injustice of great proportions” after recounting an experience he had alone in a cell while training for the army. He also said, “What happens with money in politics is not good,” in response to a question from the crowd, though he defended the free speech principles incorporated in the majority opinion he wrote in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, a landmark campaign finance law that eased or erased many political fundraising limitations and regulations.
Kennedy also described his process when he writes decisions.
“You write an opinion differently if it’s railroad reorganization or human rights; there’s a different audience,” he said.

The Schlesinger Library offered students the opportunity to learn about zines and gain experience in the feminist tradition of zine-making in an event on Thursday evening.
The special collections library, located in Radcliffe Yard, is dedicated to the history of women in America and holds over 400 zines, which are are non-commercial booklet magazines produced by individuals or small groups of writers.
Zine styles range from artistic, hand-written, and sloppy to sharp and graphically designed, some with text cut-and-pasted from magazines. The content of a zine varies based on the personal preference of the maker, but a majority focus on political discussions and contemporary feminist struggles.
At the event on Thursday, students had the opportunity to assemble their own personal zines during an open workshop, using a collection of feminist magazines and newspapers from the library.
Samantha A. Acker ’19, who works at the library and attended the workshop, said that she was excited to learn about and make zines.
“I had never heard of a zine before I came down here. I think they’re really cool,” she said.
Zines became popular in the 1970s with the advent of inexpensive photocopying technology, which made the zine production process easier, according to event organizers Amanda E. Strauss, Honor M. Moody, and Sarah M. Hutcheon. They became an outlet for individuals to create short personal “scrapbooks” dedicated to their favorite musicians for dissemination among friends and beyond. Content evolved from music to feminism in the early 1990s following the “Riot grrrl” feminist punk movement, as authors and artists felt that they wanted their personal stories and perspectives to be circulated in a non-commercial format.
Now, the organizers said, virtually every zine is either anti-copyright or is published as a creative commons document.
Hutcheon, a research librarian at the Schlesinger, said the motivation for this event was to connect undergraduates to the resources of the library.
“We have so many great formats that the library collects; we want you to know we exist,” she said.

UPDATED: October 27, 2015, at 10:41 p.m.
Doug Bradley and Craig Werner, co-authors of the forthcoming book We Gotta Get Out of the Place: Soundtrack of the Vietnam War, discussed the role of music in understanding the narratives of Vietnam War veterans on Thursday.
The event, titled “Myth, Memory, and the Music of the Vietnam War,” was co-sponsored by the Mahindra Humanities Center and the Committee on Ethnicity, Migration, and Rights.
“The 60s have become a myth more than a memory,” Werner said. “We are not making the claim to telling the truth in the simplest sense about Vietnam. This is a book about stories, and the music opened up stories about Vietnam.”
Werner proceeded to describe the 10-year process of interviewing hundreds of veterans and compiling their stories. The stories built around the songs that each veteran recalled most vividly from his or her service.
“If there’s anything that sets the Baby Boomers apart, it is music,” Bradley said, in reference to the inspiration behind the book. “It was the glue that held us together as a generation, so we knew there was power in music as a narrative.”
During the event, the audience, which was dominated by members of the Baby Boomer generation, sang along to hits by artists such as Bruce Springsteen and Aretha Franklin. Bradley and Werner interspersed recordings of music with discussion of the complex ways in which music impacted soldiers.
“The experience of the war depends on the three W’s,” Bradley said. “When you were there, where you were, and what you did.”
Werner added that while many veterans mentioned the same songs, each song had a different meaning for each person.
“The same song wasn’t really the same song, not even for the same person,” Werner said. “What the song meant often changed as the person’s experience changed.”
The discussion ended with a question and answer session, during which veterans in the audience shared their own experiences with the music and the war. Several audience members made direct personal connections with the music clips that Bradley and Werner shared.
Tessa L. Desmond, administrative director of the Committee on Ethnicity, Migration, and Rights, said she hopes that students learned about the war’s continued historical value.
“This presentation brings to the forefront the significance of the war to those who are two generations removed, who may not have it on their radar,” she said.

CORRECTIONS: October 27, 2015

Entrepreneur Stig Leschly shared anecdotes about his experiences with failure, rejection, and a determined tubist at the kickoff for the President’s and Dean’s Challenge this Thursday at the i-Lab.
In its fifth year, the Challenge “presents Harvard students with the opportunity to develop their ideas and transition them into viable, scalable ventures with the support of the University and its resources,” according to its website.
Teams have until Feb. 6 to submit their project proposals. In the coming months, the i-Lab will be offering opportunities for students to meet one another and collaborate on idea development before the proposal is due.
Leschly, who serves as CEO of MATCH Education, was largely unsuccessful in his entrepreneurial ventures during his tenure as a student at Harvard, he said, losing the Business School’s business plan competition. He spent much of his talk stressing the ubiquity of failure. 
“There’s a 90 percent chance that you will fail unceremoniously,” Leschly said. “I was summarily rejected by the very people I ended up working with,” he said. But soon later, he established Exhange.com, a startup he later sold to Amazon, before returning to Harvard to teach at the Business School.
Leschly said that in the classes he taught, he often concluded the semester with an anecdote about an acquaintance, a tubist, who studied the instrument, its virtuosos, and its market before launching an entrepreneurial venture in the tuba industry. Leschly used the story to emphasize that the goal of entrepreneurship is to “marry personal interests with the reality of going to work.”
“Don’t be an entrepreneur for the money,” he said. “I have read much literature about how little money does for your happiness.”
Leschly told students about the importance of taking advantage of the vast resources that Harvard, and specifically the i-Lab, has to offer.

Harvard administrators rolled out the College’s first-ever honor code this fall with the broad goal of spurring a “culture change” and involving students more in campus discussions about integrity, academic and otherwise.
The honor code is brand new, implemented this semester after years of planning and a massive cheating scandal. Along with asking students to sign a statement affirming their awareness of the policy, it created a student-faculty Honor Council to hear and decide cheating cases, involving undergraduates in the disciplinary process for the first time in Harvard’s history. The College’s Administrative Board still handles disciplinary cases outside the classroom. 
Administrators, in the midst of overseeing the honor code’s implementation, say they have no current plans to involve students in the College’s broader disciplinary process; Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said he has not given the possibility of student involvement in deciding non-academic disciplinary cases “any thought.”
Still, administrators acknowledge that a question that logically follows the honor code’s introduction is whether Harvard will move to expand students’ role in disciplinary procedures later on.
“I can well imagine that it’s a topic that will come up, because this year is a new departure, and who’s to say it isn’t time to consider more,” said Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67, who sits on the Ad Board. While he has not heard his colleagues discuss such a change, Dingman said, he “wouldn’t be surprised” if others were talking about it.
The concept of including students on college disciplinary bodies beyond cases of academic integrity is not new, according to Laura Bennett, the president of the Association for Student Conduct Administration. With rigorous school-specific training, students can learn to analyze policies and heed confidentiality in a way sometimes better than their faculty counterparts, Bennett said.
“Sometimes the student panelists are some of the better panelists because they understand student culture,” Bennett said.
Michael C. Ranen, the freshman resident dean for Ivy Yard who sits on the Honor Council, said the committee that created the honor code had discussed whether the policy should cover all aspects of student life, before ultimately deciding to limit its scope to academic integrity.
Nevertheless, while any change to the College’s disciplinary processes is up to the Faculty of the Arts and Sciences, Ranen noted that an expansion of the honor code would have precedent.
“It was prudent to begin with an academic honor code,” Ranen said. “Many schools have the honor code cover all aspects of student life. Harvard initially chose to focus only on academics, but it would not be unreasonable down the line for the Faculty to extend the honor code.”
Although many schools have exhibited a trend toward professionalizing disciplinary bodies, institutions with honor codes are generally more amenable to including students in disciplinary proceedings, according to Peter F. Lake ’81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who specializes in higher education law.
Lake said the College, with its first honor code coming more than 350 years after its founding, may struggle to institutionalize more student disciplinary bodies, but that an honor council could change the disciplinary landscape.
“It is hard to draw the line once you have students involved in one area of operation,” Lake said.
Jonathan G. Jeffrey ’16, an undergraduate member of the Honor Council who helped draft the honor code, declined to comment specifically on the possibility of students hearing other disciplinary cases in the future. Speaking generally, though, he said “every office should consider ways in which they can include students more, including the Administrative Board.”
Honor Council Secretary Brett Flehinger, a former interim Ad Board secretary, declined to comment on the possibility of future student involvement in non-academic disciplinary cases, writing in an email that Council members are focused on promoting a “vibrant culture of academic integrity.”
The Honor Council has started hearing its first cases.

A faculty-student committee will soon convene to review how Harvard implements its sexual assault policies, analyze data on investigations, and possibly recommend policy changes.
Although the committee has yet to meet, its finalized membership will include professors from schools across Harvard and some students, who will represent the College, graduate schools, and professional schools, respectively, according to Donald H. Pfister, the former interim dean of the College and chair of the committee. 
The committee is forming as constituents on campus continue to debate Harvard’s handling of sexual assault, even a year after it overhauled its approach to the issue by creating a new policy and a central office to investigate and adjudicate complaints.
Undergraduates, for their part, have criticized administrators for what they say was a lack of student involvement in the policy’s formation. Professors at Harvard Law School, meanwhile, have publicly lambasted the University’s approach to the issue, alleging that the policies are biased against the accused. The Law School even adopted its own alternative process for hearing student complaints, rather than follow the University's.
Beyond conversations about Harvard’s policies, this semester has been characterized by heightened attention to the prevalence of sexual assault on campus and the environment at the College. Late last month, Harvard released the results of its sexual conduct climate survey, which found that 31 percent of senior women at the College surveyed had experienced some kind of sexual misconduct during their time there—a figure administrators deemed “deeply troubling.” It also demonstrated a widespread lack of student knowledge of and trust in Harvard’s Title IX procedures.
Administrators continue to host town hall meetings in response to the survey’s release. 
The policy review committee, Pfister said, will specifically focus on evaluating the implementation of the University’s new policy and procedures, which administrators released in July 2014.
“The idea is that there’s so far... been limited implementation of policies and so forth, and it’s a good time to look and see how those are working,” Pfister said.
Other University committee have previously focused on Title IX policy at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—which includes the College—and sexual assault prevention.
Pfister said his committee will review various data on the issue. In an interview earlier this month, University Title IX Officer Mia Karvonides said the policy review committee will receive “much more specific data” from the Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution, the University’s central office that investigates most sexual harassment cases.
According to Karvonides, the office has heard between 25 and 30 cases since it opened last fall. Committee members will likely examine the office’s actual caseload, albeit in a way that maintains confidentiality, meaning it may be less detailed, Karvonides said.
Pfister, a systematic botany professor who led Harvard College in 2013-2014 to praise from students, described the committee’s agenda as “broad” at this point, but said members will convene “pretty soon.” He said members have not yet settled on how frequently they will meet, but that they will want to gather at least twice a semester.
As the group moves to convene, administrators at ODR are still offering more policy information. Last week, administrators released a supplementary document in an attempt to clarify the existing policies. Among other points, the document further detailed protections for freedom of speech in the classroom and specified that ODR designates case appeals to a group of faculty members and senior administrators.
Some Law School professors praised the document, while some undergraduates called it “totally inaccessible.”

When Harvard Law School publicly launches its capital campaign on Friday, kicking off an effort that aims to raise several hundred million dollars, it will continue a years-long attempt to rebrand itself.
Instead of evoking the halcyon days of the donors’ student experiences as a way to entice them to open their wallets, according to Steven Oliveira, dean of development and alumni relations, the Law School will share another message: The school is very different now. 
For Oliveira, the fundraising drive is a chance to show alumni that the perceived hyper-competitive and intense environment immortalized in the Oscar-winning film “The Paper Chase” has since developed into a more open, “collegial” student experience.
“This is an institution that for most of its history was not a student-centric institution,” Oliveira said, later referencing “The Paper Chase.” Over the course of the last decade and between changes like a curriculum overhaul and the construction of a student center, going to Harvard Law School has become a much more student-friendly experience, Oliveira said.
“Part of it is showing people who are in the middle of their careers, who are in a position to support the school generously, to show them how it’s changed and that you get them back here,” Oliveira said.
Morgan Chu, a former president of Harvard’s Board of Overseers and a Law School campaign co-chair, said the efforts to rejuvenate perceptions of the Law School experience are a welcome response to a real phenomenon.
There "were many students who believed that the environment was competitive in a negative aspect,” said Chu, who graduated from the Law School in 1976.
To change these perceptions and show the alumni just how different the school now is, Friday’s campaign launch will emphasize the ways in which the school has changed since the donors were students.
One major fundraising initiative is endowing clinical professorships, which focus on more personalized and hands-on experiences for students, according to Oliveira. This type of legal education differs from what was in place in decades past, when large classes of students engaged in the Socratic method with a single professor—the setting for the famous classrooms scenes in “The Paper Chase.”
But introducing a new pedagogical method to donors, Oliveira said, can be challenging.
“When you think about the people that are best equipped to make substantial philanthropic gifts to the school, they didn’t have this kind of in-depth clinical experience,” Oliveira said. “It’s not a concept they’re familiar with. So we have to spend a lot of time educating them about it.”
The launch will also showcase the work of professors in new disciplines of law that may not have even existed when some of the donors were students. At a 90-minute panel discussion titled “HLS Thinks Big,” Law School Dean Martha L. Minow will moderate a panel of experts from fields like bioethics and internet law. I. Glenn Cohen, one of the professors who will speak on Friday, wrote in an email that he will discuss bioethics and health law.
“As part of the campaign I do whatever I can to connect with alumni interested in these areas (health law, bioethics, food and drug law, biotechnology) and explain why this is such an exciting time for our students and our law school to be involved in these issues,” Cohen wrote.
The messaging campaign at the Law School’s event is another aspect of a generally unusual campaign. Because of the proximity of its most recent fundraising effort and a fear of over-soliciting donors, the Law School’s current campaign has a smaller goal and an unconventional outreach strategy.

Urban artist and activist Caledonia Curry—better known by her artist name "Swoon”—opened the Loeb Fellowship 45th anniversary and alumni weekend by discussing the role of art in activism and her personal shift toward art that serves a practical purpose.
“I had this really gnawing feeling where we just moved mountains, where we just raised insane amounts of money [for artistic installations],” Swoon said before a packed Piper Auditorium audience at the Graduate School of Design on Thursday evening. “I just thought, ‘God, what about if we put this to a different use.'”
Swoon then turned her attentions to projects in collaborative architecture with local communities, starting with the construction of “Superadobe” community centers following the 2010 Haitian earthquake, and later the design of ceramic tiles for a church in the decaying city of Braddock, Pa.
Instead of allowing the dilapidated structure to be bulldozed, she deconstructed more run-down sections of the church, reusing the bricks to create a new artistic space for the Braddock community.
Swoon views such projects as an integral part of resistance against passive acceptance of major global crises, such as global warming and modern imperialism.
“There are forms of resistance which take the form of not settling for the brokenness of the way things are,” she said. “Of not seeing that brokenness as inevitable. This sort of resistance begins with naming it.”
Swoon outlined her own tale of artistic resistance, recalling the various ways with which she dealt with the brokenness that she saw in her world.
Her artistic career began with classical training in visual art and printmaking at the Pratt Institute; during that time, however, she turned to the world of street art. “I felt like I wanted to be a part of my world in a different way,” she said. “And with cities I just saw this new language, and it felt to me that in some ways cities were the highest art form.”
The audience, comprised largely of Loeb Fellowship alumni, Graduate School of Design alumni, and other architects and artists, took note.

UPDATED: October 26, 2015, at 4:38 a.m.
Before a room filled with representatives from universities around the world, University President Drew G. Faust kicked off a conference about the future of research in higher education, highlighting the need to accommodate the current university landscape to the technological developments of the 21st century.
In the panel Thursday night, Faust spoke with Richard C. Levin, a former Yale president and current head of online education company Coursera, and David J. Skorton, a former Cornell president and recently-appointed secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. The three university leaders shared their perspectives on a range of issues, from constructing new campuses abroad to online education.
“The result here is all of you today, to help us think and to help all of you think about the new kinds of challenges that we encounter as we try to imagine physical campuses in a digital age,” Faust said in her opening remarks.
The officials from Harvard and elsewhere convened at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study for a two-day program of events and conversations. The group enjoyed salmon, steak, and panna cotta between remarks from Faust and a panel discussion.
Levin, who led Yale for 20 years, recounted the decisions he made to grow a number of the school’s programs, specifically in the sciences and abroad. He cited several challenges of innovating in the design and construction process, saying universities need to think about projecting 30 to 50 years ahead and that that effort requires a central authority.
“At Yale, we had a decision maker,” Levin said. “I mean, I listened to everybody, but I signed it, and somebody has to do that.”
Multiple times, Levin questioned the utility of faculty committees, arguing they can be ineffective because they are subjected to the opinions of faculty members who may not think in the long-term. Instead, he said he tended to ask each committee member their individual opinions, rather than accept the vote of the group, strongly preferring “single unitary leadership” from the president.
“A great pitfall in universities is we delegate too much to committees,” Levin said.
As trends in education continue to move towards science, technology, engineering, and math, Skorton reminded the audience of elite educators that arts and humanities studies should not be forgotten. Citing Faust as a model humanities advocate, Skorton claimed that arts and humanities education is important for helping students develop analytical and critical thinking skills.
“Far better to create in students the capacities to confront the circumstances of life and with a combination of realism and resilience, and with habits of mind and skills of analysis that transcend the present,” Skorton said. “We should listen to Drew Faust.”
After the former presidents made opening presentations, they discussed their experiences with Faust and opened the floor to questions. From the audience, Michael D. Smith, dean of Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences, asked about the benefits of having satellite campuses around the world—institutions that both Yale and Cornell have established, but that Harvard has chosen not to construct.
Both Levin and Skorton cited coordination and logistical challenges of having campuses across time zones and bodies of water. Skorton added that while he was in charge of Cornell, which operates satellite campuses in Doha and New York City in addition to its central location in Ithaca, N.Y., he “found it if not impossible, very hard, to have a senior vision that would work at all of these different four campuses.”
The speakers also discussed questions surrounding online education and the reality that some students may be able to go on to professional or master’s degrees without an on-campus undergraduate experience. Faust, though, noted the irony of the conference—a place where ideas are “live, not streamed.”
The evening’s proceedings drew a large crowd and were also recorded on video.
“I’m struck at how often that I find myself at gatherings where the question of whether online learning is going to take over the world is posed, when people have come from all over the place in order to be here face-to-face,” Faust said.

CORRECTION: October 26, 2015
An earlier version of this article misattributed a quotation from David Skorton to Richard Levin. In fact, Skorton “found it if not impossible, very hard, to have a senior vision” while overseeing Cornell's campuses.

Saturday will mark the biggest game of the season for the Harvard women’s soccer team, as the Crimson (7-6-1, 4-0-0 Ivy) takes on Princeton (11-3-0, 4-0-0) at Jordan Field, with sole possession of first place in the Ivy League standings at stake.
Harvard and the Tigers enter the contest as the only remaining unbeaten sides in the Ancient Eight and tied for first in the conference. The team that emerges victorious on Saturday will surpass the other for an outright hold on the top spot in the league with just two conference games left to play.
Despite a slow start to the season, the Crimson has rebounded and enters the matchup riding a five-game winning streak. Harvard struggled at the start of a campaign which featured games against three nationally ranked programs, including then-no. 1 Virginia, taking home a mere two wins from its first nine contests. Since Ivy League play began a month ago, Harvard has found its footing and has taken full points from six of its last eight matches.
Junior forward Midge Purce has been the catalyst in the Crimson’s resurgence this season. The striker has tallied six goals on 32 shots in Harvard’s last five games, including a hat trick against Yale. Purce has also earned Ivy League Player of the Week honors two times in a row for her efforts this season.
“Midge has hit her top form,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “I am proud of how she has handled herself this year.”
The Crimson will look to carry its momentum into a match that has historically been decisive in deciding the conference champion. Either Harvard or the Tigers has captured the Ancient Eight title in six of the last seven seasons.
Last season, the Crimson narrowly prevailed over Princeton in a hard-fought 5-4 win en route to the team’s second Ivy League championship in as many years. The match was a seesaw affair, with Harvard taking the lead twice, only to see the Tigers pull even each time. This year’s contest figures to be lower-scoring due to the Crimson’s consistent defensive play, as Harvard has yet to allow a goal in Ivy League play.
“I think we have a very strong team mentality of defending all over the field,” junior goalkeeper Lizzie Durack said. “I think that’s something that we have shown strength in throughout the season, and I think it will be key in stifling Princeton.”
The Crimson will have to be flawless on defense, as Princeton enters the contest as the most dangerous offensive team in the Ivy League. The Tigers currently lead the Ancient Eight in shots, goals, and assists, and boasts the sixth-highest-scoring offense in the country.
The Princeton attack has been spearheaded this year by junior forward Tyler Lussi. The striker leads the conference in nearly every offensive category, with a league-high 11 goals to her name. Her scoring heroics have earned her Player of the Week honors three times this season.
Tigers sophomore midfielder Vanessa Gregoire is the Ancient Eight leader in assists - the only offensive statistic not dominated by Lussi. The second-year has set up seven goals in 2015 in addition to the four times she has found the back of the net herself.
“The back line has been exceptional this year, not only in their airtight defense but also by playing huge roles in the attack,” senior forward Emily Mosbacher said. “We’ll look to them to keep up a tough defense, as they have over the past five games.”
Indeed, the Harvard back line has done its job consistently this season. The team has conceded just a single goal so far in the month of October. Durack has only needed to stop eight shots on goal in Ivy League play began. The junior is currently second in the conference in clean sheets, with six on the season. On Saturday, Durack and the rest of the Crimson will face its toughest challenge yet.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Greetings, dear reader. Last we met, the 2014 Harvard football team was days away from its climactic showdown with Yale for all the marbles, an undefeated season hanging in the balance.
Much has transpired since. The Crimson sent the Elis home in defeat and captured an Ivy League championship. The team attained perfection for only the third time in the last century. And akin to Globo Gym dominating the competition of the American Dodgeball Association of America, Harvard has blazed its way to an unblemished record through the first five games of 2015.
Let’s think of this current season as a sequel to the 2014 campaign. I need not explain how movie sequels are often predictable. You often know exactly what you’re going to get when you walk into a theater to see the addendum to a moneymaking first rendition.
Take 22 Jump Street. Could that film have adhered any more closely to the plot of its predecessor? Or how about any of the Transformers sequels (somehow, there are three after the original). Did anyone actually enjoy (or even watch) those unsurprising remakes?
2014 was that chart-topping first hit for Harvard. How can you improve on an undefeated season and an Ivy League championship? Well, you can’t. But you can equal it by pulling off the same feat once more.
The Crimson is intent on making the 2015 season one of those straightforward, predictable sequels to the first moneymaker. It has certainly done a solid job thus far. Harvard’s first five wins have been decided by just over an average of 36 points per game, and the team’s starters haven’t once needed to play a contest from start to finish. That’s a pretty boring sequel if there ever was one.
But some sequels contain a twist. It’s always more fun when things play out in unpredictable fashion, right? Indeed, these are the very best kinds of remakes—the ones that keep you guessing.
For instance, moviegoers may have thought they were getting more of the same action-packed, original Star Wars when they ventured to see The Empire Strikes Back in 1980. But I recall there being a pretty significant plot twist toward the end that threw everyone for a loop.
By now, you probably have a rough understanding of the filmography I indulge in. But that’s not what I’m trying to convey here. Through five games this year, Harvard football is in the same position as it was in 2014—with five wins. So far, the sequel to that championship run has adhered to a predictable script of dominance. But things often change quickly in the Ancient Eight (irony intended).
Will Harvard march to a repeat championship without suspense or drama? Or will the 2015 season contain some type of plot twist, as the great sequels often do? The Crimson suits up against a pair of opponents at home over the next two weeks—Princeton and Dartmouth—that are of a decidedly different caliber than the weaker competition the team has faced so far this year. If there’s ever a time for a classic sequel twist, it’s now.
You may think you know what will transpire, but you don’t. Another Ivy League stretch run begins on Saturday. Welcome back.
BROWN AT CORNELL
Nice. It’s been a while since I last made these predictions, so I appreciate the opportunity to get warmed up with a game that will likely bear no consequences for the rest of the Ivy League. The Crimson football beat braved the trek to Ithaca two weekends ago to see Harvard coast to a 40-3 victory over the Big Red. The most enjoyable part of the trip for me was undoubtedly the stop at Collegetown Bagels on campus where, in case you’re wondering, they serve a mean smoked salmon sandwich. Beyond that, there’s not much to see in Ithaca. Likewise with this game.
Prediction: Brown 34, Cornell 14
COLUMBIA AT DARTMOUTH
Prior to the start of this season, Dartmouth introduced into its football practices a new MVP. Stay calm, Dalyn Williams. The Most Valuable Player award still belongs to you. I am here referring to a Mobile Virtual Player, a 5’11”, 200-pound robotic dummy for human players to tackle during practice. Not only are the robots indestructible, but they apparently can run a 4.8-second 40-yard-dash. Great idea, Dartmouth. Let’s build something big, strong, and fast that can’t be subdued by human force. Speaking of my movie theme, anyone remember iRobot? I’m not the only one raising an eyebrow at this, right? (Well, Stephen Colbert successfully tackled one robot, so maybe it’s not all that tough.)
Oddly enough, Dartmouth itself has morphed into a machine over the course of the 2015 campaign, rolling over each of its five opponents thus far. Lowly Columbia merely represents a tune-up for the Big Green before the high stakes showdown with Harvard next Saturday in Cambridge.
Prediction: Dartmouth 42, Columbia 7
YALE AT PENN
This will likely be the most competitive conference game of the weekend. The one-loss Elis, who may still be reeling from the departure of running back Tyler Varga ’15, are at risk of falling out of contention in the Ivy League title race. Penn, meanwhile, has scored 40-plus points in consecutive weeks for the first time since 2007. Look for the Bulldogs to come together in this must-win situation and pull out a gutsy W in Philadelphia.
Prediction: Yale 28, Penn 24
PRINCETON AT HARVARD
I remember where I was when I learned Princeton scored 29 unanswered fourth quarter points to shock Harvard in 2012. I remember where I was the next year (in the press box; that one’s easy) when the Tigers outlasted the Crimson in triple-overtime. Harvard finally had its revenge last year, though, dominating Princeton by 42 points in New Jersey. For once, our game stories weren’t frantically revised at the last minute. It won’t be as much of a Harvard rout this year, but the contest will likely be out of reach by the middle of the fourth quarter.
Prediction: Harvard 38, Princeton 17

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twenty-two starters took the field for the Harvard football team on October 26th, 2013. Three overtime periods later, Princeton handed the Crimson its first defeat of the season.
It’s nearly two years to the day later, and that game remains most recent loss that Harvard has suffered. On Saturday, the Tigers (4-1, 1-1 Ivy) will get another chance in Harvard Stadium to tarnish a perfect record in a matchup with the Crimson (5-0, 2-0), which has looked nearly unstoppable through the first half of the 2015 slate.
Of the 22 that stepped onto the gridiron to begin the game for Harvard in 2013, only five of those starters remain to avenge the loss. For those five and the rest of the senior class, Saturday won’t just be about wiping away memories of the triple overtime contest, but also about getting retribution for the 2012 defeat the Crimson suffered to the Tigers after a 24-point fourth quarter lead melted away.
“As a freshman, I was watching [the 2012 game] here on campus and it just broke our hearts to see that victory go away, and the following year, in triple overtime, it’s just two heartbreakers back-to-back against Princeton,” captain Matt Koran said. “Last year we were able to really get revenge that we were seeking, and this year I think the big thing is to even the score.”
Harvard will enter the game with the confidence that comes with amassing 221 points in five games, the most prolific offensive output in 123 years. But in order to send off its seniors with a 2-2 career record against the Tigers, the Crimson will need to maintain its scoring deluge against the stiffest competition it has faced all season.
“We haven’t faced a team that has as many good athletes as Princeton in all phases,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “There’ll be a little bit of a ‘whoa’ factor by their skill on both sides of the ball.”
Princeton boasts both the third best scoring offense and defense of the league behind undefeated Harvard and Dartmouth but showed its fallibility in last week at Brown, when a number of costly turnovers and a last-minute Bears touchdown handed the Tigers their first loss of the season.
After Brown scored a touchdown on the opening kickoff return, Princeton trailed for the remainder of the game, allowing Brown to put up 477 yards of offense en route to a 38-31 victory.
The Tigers’ defensive front seven will have its hands full again against perhaps the best offensive line in the Ancient Eight. The veteran group has allowed just two sacks all season and has paved the way for senior running back Paul Stanton to lead the league in averaging 99.6 yards per game, an even more impressive statistic considering Stanton has yet to play a full 60 minutes given the lopsided contests.
Harvard has posted an impressive average deficit margin of 36.2 points through five games and has not looked back since its 2013 defeat. The Crimson is currently riding a 19-game win streak, second in Division I football only to Ohio State with 20.
The success thus far this season has been largely due to a stifling defense, which has held opponents to an average of 8.0 points. Led by a veteran secondary, Harvard’s defense has allowed just one field goal over the span of three games and will face its first high-octane offense of the year in Princeton’s traditionally up-tempo, no-huddle squad.
The Tigers utilize a running back by committee that has produced nearly 200 rushing yards per game, trailing only Harvard in rushing offense. But against an unyielding defensive line that has kept opponents to an average of 72.6 yards on the ground, Princeton may have to turn to the air in inexperienced quarterback Chad Kanoff, who fills big shoes following the graduation of the duo threat of play-callers Quinn Epperly and Connor Michelsen.
“The previous two quarterbacks, they were really great,” Koran said. “I don’t think they’ve missed too many steps with Chad….. He’s got a great arm and seems like he can run the offense.”
Ranked the 14th-best dual-threat high school quarterback nationally by ESPN.com, Kanoff looked poised in his first four games, throwing just one pick. But last week at Brown, Kanoff threw two interceptions, including one lobbed under pressure with just over a minute remaining that set up the Bears’ go-ahead touchdown.

Freshman Parents weekend is here. This upcoming weekend will see the Yard flooded with hundreds of parents from across the globe donning Crimson attire. While we could go through all the events happening this weekend and tell you which ones sound interesting, we will instead focus on the most important aspect of Parents Weekend: how to ensure that your parents will see you as having blossomed into a fully responsible college adult who most certainly has a grip on every aspect of life.
Prep your dorm room
The first step in getting ready for Parents Weekend is to prepare your dorm room. While most parents are likely attune to the realities of college life, some still remain willfully and blissfully ignorant. For freshman whose parents fit this latter category, we suggest doing an extensive sweep of your dorm room to get rid of any incriminating material.
First and foremost, hide the alcohol. Your parents’ confidence in your competency will not be reinforced by the sight of illicit substances strewn across the floor. Transfer your alcohol to nondescript water bottles, or just invite your friends over to your room and finish all the alcohol before your parents arrive. Don’t clean your room too well however– that unidentifiable lingering odor will be your best tool in getting your parents out of your dorm room quickly before they have had any time to look around.
Friday and Saturday Nights- Do's and Dont's
Your parents, in their desire to spend time with you, will most likely wish to extend family bonding time into the evening hours. It is important to carefully navigate this stretch from 9 p.m. to midnight, lest your parents be exposed to the horrors of weekends in a college town. First, freshmen should avoid taking their parents to Felipe’s after 9. Although those burritos may be tempting, the intoxicated students streaming up to the rooftop bar isn’t a sight that you want your parents to witness. Tasty Burger should also be avoided after 10 p.m. at all costs.
Instead, start the night off by taking your parents to Annenberg once so that they’ll feel bad enough to buy you meals at actual restaurants for the rest of the weekend. Finally, stay off Mount Auburn Street after 10. The sight of people stumbling down the Mount Auburn will provoke a conversation that you really don’t want to have: “Oh, you don’t go to these parties when we’re not around, right?
Remember, freshmen: this weekend is all about pretending your room is in fact this clean all the time and lamenting about how much you miss homemade food (read: please stock up my fridge with Whole Foods and also take me out to every meal so I have leftovers for the rest of this week).
