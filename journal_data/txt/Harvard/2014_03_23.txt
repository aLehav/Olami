After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Hundreds of energetic Crimson fans from the Harvard and Cambridge community gathered in dorms, in restaurants, and around laptops in the Yard and across the Square on Saturday night to watch Harvard’s men basketball team face Michigan State in the third-round NCAA Tournament game.
 
Although the Crimson ended its bid at the tournament after losing 73-80 to the Spartans in Spokane, Wash., fans said they were proud of the team’s performance in its final matchup this season and supported the team even through the game’s final minutes.
 
Harvard Athletics invited students to watch the game at the Cambridge Queen’s Head pub, John Harvard’s Brewery & Ale House, and the Student Organization Center at Hilles. Fans also watched at other Square restaurants.
 
“The energy was palpable,” Anne Carroll Ingersoll ’12 said of the atmosphere in John Harvard’s Brewery, where she watched the matchup with fellow alumnus Kristen E. Arn ’12. “I haven’t felt like this since actually attending a game [at Harvard].”
 
According to Ashley Tart, the general manager of John Harvard’s, the brewery hosted the largest watch party in Cambridge. To her, the night was “non-comparable,” as more than 100 fans donning Crimson shirts and foam fingers crowded every corner of the restaurant, including the entryway, to cheer on the team.
 
In fact, the servers were often so busy delivering food and drinks to their patrons that they did not always know the status of the game.
 
“To be honest, I [couldn't] watch the game,” said Katie David, a server at the brewery who noted that the crowd got much louder and rowdier as the game progressed into the second half. “Not a lot of places have an open space like this with a lot of TVs. Most just have a bar and three or four TVs.”
 
Events like the watch party at John Harvard’s drew alumni of the College back to the Square in support of their alma mater.
 
Jason C. Flood ’11 said Saturday’s matchup was a great game and that the Crimson’s second-half comeback made the atmosphere in the brewery exciting.
 
“I’m really proud of them,” Flood said. “They played smart and put up a great fight.”
 
And while the game brought together Harvard alumni, newcomers to the Crimson’s basketball prowess said they were excited to continue to root for the team in the future.
 
Matthew Wu ’17, who made pasta with some of his friends in the basement of the Holworthy dorm and watched the game on a laptop, said he thought watching the team perform on national television was a “great experience.”
 
“It was good to hope for something,” Wu said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 24, 2014, at 2:28 a.m.
Canvas, a web interface currently piloted by dozens of Harvard courses, will replace iSites as the University’s platform for course websites by the 2016-17 academic year.
The system, launched in 2011 by a company called Instructure and used by more than 600 educational institutions nationwide, is part of a new Harvard University Information Technology initiative called Teaching and Learning Technologies, which hopes to utilize several open-source technologies like Canvas in order to promote educational innovation.
According Kristin Sullivan, the program director for Teaching and Learning Technologies, Canvas will allow Harvard faculty to customize features on their course websites, like calendars and gradebooks.
“We have been able to contribute to the platform,” Sullivan wrote in an email, noting that Harvard has piloted Canvas since the fall semester and recently decided it will universalize the system. “We are participating in their open-source community and have built custom tools supported by the platform."
Some faculty members said that Canvas’ flexibility, even in its less-functional pilot stage, will enable them and their teaching fellows to grade assignments and manage their courses more efficiently.
iSites, the platform that most Harvard courses currently use, has been at the University for more than ten years. Brown University has transitioned to Canvas from their previous system.
“The problem with iSites is that it is a fairly rigid, costly way of developing a platform,” history professor Daniel L. Smail said. “We are excited about the possibilities for Canvas, but it will be much better once it can develop the full functionality we are looking for.”
 
Smail, whose course “Culture and Belief 51: Making the Middle Ages” currently uses Canvas, also said he thinks students seem most excited about Canvas’ gradebook, which allows Smail and his teaching fellows to simultaneously view and grade student-submitted assignments. The students can then view their assignments’ scores, along with their other grades.
“Everything is integrated right into the architecture of the system,” Smail said.
Students, however, said they are skeptical of the platform’s functionality.
“I think while it might look nicer, it’s really hard to use because it’s hard to find things,” said Rachel E. Halperin ’16, who uses Canvas for Life Sciences 1b. “It’s not as intuitive. Some things are listed on the side or hidden behind each other.” 
Julius G. Bright Ross ’17, a student in Smail’s Culture and Belief class, agreed that sometimes the platform can be confusing to navigate. 
“It’s a fairly good website as far as I can tell,” he said. “I think teachers can go way too out of control with it though. They create way too many mini sites and pages.”
Even still, many students expressed hope in Canvas’ innovative goals, so long as administrators continue developing the platform’s tools and functions.
 
“It seems to me that [Canvas] is pretty new, and its implementation is in the infantine stages,” said Ansel B. Duff ’15, whose course Physical Sciences 11 is piloting Canvas. “In order for it to be University-wide, it really needs to be fleshed out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eleven Harvard fencers made the trip to Columbus, Ohio to compete in the NCAA Championships this past week, facing off against the best collegiate fencers in the nation. After over two-dozen bouts in the sabre event, freshman Adrienne Jarocki brought home an individual title over teammate Aliya Itzkowitz, leading the Crimson to a fifth-place finish as a squad.
 
“Team-wise, I thought we had a little better shot at getting a bit higher,” Harvard coach Peter Brand said. “We were very close…. But never in the history of Harvard fencing have we had a 1-2 finish in an individual event…so in that respect, it was a great four days for us."
 
WOMEN'S FENCING
The final bout of the women’s sabre event was an all-Crimson affair Friday afternoon, with top-seeded Itzkowitz on the strip against Jarocki. The situation presented an odd challenge for Harvard fencers and affiliates on hand.
“There’s no coaching then, no real cheering because we’re from the same school,” Jarocki said. “Coach [Brand] can’t really coach, and no one is going to cheer for someone from the same school.”
Needing only one touch to win in the first-to-15 touch final, Jarocki patiently retreated as her Crimson counterpart advanced down the strip, beating her blade in the process. As the sophomore began her overhead attack, the freshman saw her chance and attacked in preparation to secure the bout.
“It was kind of a perfect situation, to be honest,” Jarocki said. “There’s no one else I would have rather fenced in the finals because either way, the team would be taking home gold and silver, and if I had lost, it would have been to someone that I love and respect.”
Though Jarocki beat Itzkowitz for the championship, the latter had eked out a 5-4 victory when the two had met in pool play.
“I was really pleased overall,” Itzkowitz said. “I struggled to be consistent [last year] and that’s the key in this tournament if you want to make the top four…. This year I managed to find that zone and enjoy myself, not thinking too much about my record.”
Further demonstrating the Ivy League’s strength in the weapon, Princeton’s Gracie Stone tied for third after falling to Jarocki, 15-10, in the semifinals.
On the women’s foil side, it was a Kiefer that won the title this year, but not Harvard’s Alexandra Kiefer; her Notre Dame sophomore sister, Lee, took first with a 13-10 victory over fellow Fighting Irish teammate Madison Zeiss.
For the Crimson Kiefer, her 16-7 record was good enough for sixth in the 24-person pool, but her plus-26 indicator was three touches short to squeeze her into the final four and a shot at her second NCAA women’s foil individual title. The senior finished her NCAA championships career with a gold, two sixth-place finishes, and an eleventh place finish.
“Kiefer has been an extremely consistent fencer for us,” Itzkowitz said. “She put in a great performance for [the team] in her final year.”
Harvard sophomore Isabel DiTella just missed a spot in the épeé final four in her first season with the Crimson, coming in sixth in the event. The well-balanced pool saw 15 of the 24 competitors come away with nine to 13 wins out of 23. Junior Emma Vaggo finished ninth with a plus-13 indicator. In the two’s pool play bout, the sophomore came away with the full-time 1-0 victory.
MEN'S FENCING
 
Faced with stiff competition all around, the six Crimson men finished in the middle of the pack of their respective events, earning enough points to keep Harvard in the top-five and 34 points behind first place Penn State.
Harvard’s best group showing came in the foil event, with junior Brian Kaneshige and sophomore Michael Woo coming in eighth and ninth, respectively. Both completed the two-day event with a 13-10 record and positive indicators in a stacked pool that included multiple Olympians.
Captain Michael Raynis took home sixth in épeé in his final NCAA championship, recording a 13-10 bout record and a plus-15 indictor. He was an extra win and a few touches away from the final four in the pool.
In his first NCAA championship, freshman épeéist Alexander Eldeib won 10 bouts, good enough for 17th.
Senior Eric Arzoian had the Crimson’s final top-10 finish of the day, earning 11 wins and a plus-3 indicator in the sabre pool.
“Eric gave it [his] all…. [H]e really fought all the way and had a very good day overall,” Brand said.
Struggling to cope with an injury suffered on day two, junior Alexander Ryjik took home 20th with eight bout wins to round out the tournament.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
SPOKANE, Wash.—While winning tonight’s matchup would have advanced the Harvard men’s basketball team to the Sweet Sixteen, the final result of the Crimson’s contest against Michigan State was, instead, bittersweet.
 
For twenty-five minutes, the game seemed over, a done deal that was all-but-sealed. The Spartans (28-8, 12-6 Big Ten) went up by as many as 16 points in the second half, scoring with seeming ease over Harvard’s defenders in the paint and from deep.
 
But with 15:37 left in the game and Harvard’s chances to advance quickly slipping away, a smaller lineup took the floor for the Crimson (27-5, 13-1 Ivy), and co-captain Brandyn Curry’s back-to-back three pointers sparked a 19-3 Harvard run that culminated in an emphatic dunk by junior wing Wesley Saunders.
 
After Saunders found Curry in the corner for three and sophomore point guard Siyani Chambers dimed Curry on his next trey, junior forward Steve Moundou-Missi knocked down a free throw and a dunk to bring the Crimson within single digits for the first time since the opening minutes.
 
Spartan sophomore guard Gary Harris and Moundou-Missi then traded baskets, the former scoring on a lay-in and the latter on a right baseline jumper, setting up a crowd-waking, rim-shaking dunk to bring the Crimson within eight.
 
Following Moundou-Missi’s short corner jumper, Spartan senior guard Keith Appling brought the ball up, and dished it to 6’10” classmate Adreian Payne inside. Moundou-Missi stuck with the bigger man, and forced the travel.
 
Thirty seconds later, after two Saunders free throws, Harvard went into a press. Curry pressured Harris, and forced him to throw an errant pass to Payne. The pass was deflected by Saunders, and Moundou-Missi ran down the loose ball: he grabbed it, put it on the floor, and stuffed it home over Spartan sophomore Denzel Valentine.
 
Four-point game, 12-point swing, and a shift in momentum so large that a previously near-silent Crimson fan section began chanting “I believe.”
 
“[A]t halftime I told the guys that we just need to fight,” Curry said. “[W]e just rallied together…. [We wanted to] put game-type pressure on them…. We wanted to really challenge them.”
 
The crowd only got louder. A Payne missed three on the other end led to a Moundou-Missi transition tip-in 13 seconds later, and a charge on Harris gave the rock to the underdogs once more.
 
After a sequence of passes in which every Harvard player on the floor touched the ball, Moundou-Missi misfired on a layup attempt, and Michigan State sophomore forward Matt Costello cleaned up the glass. The Spartan’s attempt to get rid of the ball was intercepted by Saunders, who went straight to the paint and completed the two-handed flush.
 
Fifty-five all. Michigan State’s surefire bid to the Sweet Sixteen was suddenly a little more tenuous.
 
Two minutes later, a trademark corner three from Crimson co-captain Laurent Rivard gave the squad its first lead of the night, 62-60.
 
However, the Spartans responded with treys of their own. Harris and Denzel both drilled shots from beyond the arc, and a multitude of Michigan State players knocked down free throws in the waning moments to clinch the victory, 80-73, for the favorites.
 
Harvard coach Tommy Amaker attributed much of Harvard’s 22-6 run to the smaller lineup that took the floor, a combination of players that enabled the squad to play a four-out offense. Only junior forward Steve Moundou-Missi set up camp down low, while the four other Crimson players spaced out around the three-point arc.
 
“I thought that group in particular really gave us the effort that we needed,” Amaker said. “We spaced the floor a lot better being smaller…. [W]e wanted to stay with that group.  That group was the group that obviously got us back into it and made the run, and we were hoping that that group [was] going to be able to bring it home for us.”
 
Early on, this third-round matchup seemed like it would end in a blowout. The Spartans was playing faster, stronger, and bigger in the opening minutes, and Harvard was to keep up with the pace.
 
Eight of the nine Spartan players that took the floor in the first period scored, while junior guard Branden Dawson led the fourth-seeded squad with 20 points in the first half. Harvard was kept in the game thanks to Saunders’ efficiency. Saunders broke the 1000-point mark of his collegiate career in the opening half, and ended the game with a team-high 22 points, going 10-of-10 from the charity stripe.
 
Much of Michigan’s offense came off of fast breaks, and its fast-paced attack started early and came often.
 
Off of Moundou-Missi’s missed shot less than a minute into the game, Dawson grabbed the board and started down the court. The junior found a streaking Valentine, whose runner at the second hashmark was good—2-0, Spartans.
 
On the following Harvard possession, senior forward Kyle Casey threw an errant pass, which was intercepted by Harris. The Spartan streaked a pass to Dawson, who elevated for an easy dunk.
 
“I felt like, [in] the first half, that just wasn’t us out there,” Curry said. “We felt like so far in that game, we hadn’t really challenged them. It was kind of easy for them with all the shots and layups they were getting.”
 
 
Michigan State slammed down four dunks, rolled in four layups, and tallied one tip-shot in the first twenty minutes, an indication of its dominance in the paint. While the Spartan outscored the Crimson in the key, 24-14, in the first half, Harvard limited its opponents to only 10 points in the key in the final period.
 
“[At halftime] we talked about how we were better than [our first half performance],” Amaker added. “As good as they are, we were still better than what we played in the first 20 minutes. And it was important for us to remember who we were and who we have been all year.”
 
As has been true all season, it was a balanced effort for the Spartans on Saturday night. Dawson led the way in scoring with 26, but Harris wasn’t far behind with 18. After a monster performance from Payne in the second round of the NCAA Tournament against Delaware—the senior tallied 41 points, going a perfect 17-of-17 from the line—he managed only 12 points against the Harvard defense, shooting at a 40 percent clip from the floor.
 
Along with Saunders’ 22 points, the Crimson had three other players hit double figures—Curry, Moundou-Missi, and Chambers scored 12, 11, and 10, respectively. Each were on the floor during the Harvard run that turned a blow-out into a nailbiter.
 
“We just came out and fought our hardest, and that’s really all you can ask for sometimes, no matter what the scoreboard says,” Saunders said. “I think that we showed some people that we have the heart of a champion out here.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SPOKANE, Wash.—Cinderella may have been invited to the Dance, but she’s going home early.
After winning its first game in the NCAA Tournament for the second straight year, the Harvard men’s basketball team (27-5, 13-1 Ivy) will once again bow out of the Dance before the Sweet Sixteen. After trailing by as many as 16 against Michigan State (28-8, 12-6 Big Ten), the Crimson’s late second half charge was not enough in an 80-73 loss to the team that the President picked to win the national championship.
In defeat, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker was both quick to praise the Spartans and proud of his team.
“They’re explosive, talented, we knew that,” Amaker said. “But I think we’re a ball club that people recognize [is] a darn good basketball team.”
OUT AND RUNNING
But before the five minutes that Harvard will never forget came 25 it would rather never remember. The Crimson was outscored by 12 in the game’s opening frame, as the Spartans turned the match into a track meet. Leaking out one player after every Harvard shot or turnover, Spartan guards Keith Appling and Gary Harris routinely beat their Crimson counterparts down the court.
However, while Harvard junior wing Wesley Saunders and sophomore point guard Siyani Chambers recovered well, the big men did not. Spartan forward Branden Dawson beat the Crimson frontcourt down the court time and time again, scoring 20 points in the first half on a dazzling array of layups and dunks. Michigan State shot 16-of-19 inside the arc early, dropping down hammer after hammer to bring the capacity crowd to its feet.
“We certainly were knocked back at the beginning…that really put us in the hole, where they got so many transition baskets,” Amaker said.
THE LONE RANGER
At halftime, Amaker adjusted. After putting in his starters to begin the second half, the coach quickly yanked senior forward Kyle Casey after two fouls and two misses in the period’s first three minutes. Casey would not leave the bench for the rest of the half as the Crimson went small, spreading four shooters (co-captains Brandyn Curry and Laurent Rivard, Saunders, and Chambers) around a lone big man.
“It’s been a weapon for us throughout the year,” Rivard said. “It creates a disadvantage for us on the defensive end but also creates a disadvantage for them on the defensive end.”
The small lineups flummoxed the bigger Spartans, who struggled to get forwards Dawson and Adreian Payne (10 combined second half points) going. After turning the ball over once in the first half, the Spartans had 10 turnovers in the second period and recorded zero fast break points.
And as the game slowed to Harvard’s pace, the threes began to fall.
The first, a wing trey from Curry, cut a game-high 16-point Spartan lead to 13. The co-captain’s follow 34 seconds later cut it to 11. The third, a Rivard wing triple that capped a 26-8 run, put Harvard in front for the only time of the evening.
“I thought they responded incredibly well, as you saw, and certainly battled,” Amaker said.
Although the threes bookended the run, the substance of it came from the Crimson’s single post presence. Junior forward Steve Moundou-Missi lived above the rim in the second half, with two dunks and a tip-in during one three-minute stretch that cut the deficit from 10 to two.
More importantly, after Payne and Dawson had dunks a minute apart early in the half, Moundou-Missi closed off the rim. From the 17-minute mark of the second half onward, a Spartan team that had 24 points in the paint in the opening period had just two layups the rest of the game.
“After the first half, we felt like we didn’t play great, and the second half was all about our effort and fight,” Moundou-Missi said. “We weren’t going to go out like that.”
SAYING GOODBYE
But after David threw a punch, Goliath responded with a haymaker.
Harvard didn’t have the lead for more than 19 seconds before Spartan junior Travis Trice drained a three to give his team the lead. After a pair of Payne free throws, Izzo’s squad pushed the ball on a Saunders miss and found an open Harris on the wing. His three pushed the lead to eight and Harvard never got closer than four the rest of the way.
“We want[ed] to really challenge them,” Curry said. “And they responded like great teams do.”
For the Crimson’s seniors, there was little solace in “almost.” For Dee Giger and Tom Hamel—onlookers the entire Tournament—there was little to be done; for Curry and Rivard, each of whom missed a free throw in the game’s final five minutes, there was little to be forgotten.
“We never wanted to give up,” Rivard said.
The class exited with as much acclaim as any in Crimson history. Rivard, who matched his single-season record for three-pointers in the loss, has made more triples than anyone in the Harvard record books. Casey and Curry returned from a yearlong absence to lead the Crimson to a program-record 27 wins, exchanging individual numbers for W’s.
When push came to shove against a prohibitive national title favorite, the seniors provided the resolve that characterized their careers. Curry and Rivard—who combined for 19 points, 14 in the second half—had five of the team’s six threes without a single turnover.
When Curry, Giger and Casey arrived at Harvard, the team ended its first season in the CTI. Four years and 98 wins later, it was five minutes from the Sweet Sixteen.
“It’s no surprise to see us come this far,” Curry said. “What Coach Amaker has created here, it’s just a wonderful thing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s lacrosse team continued its perfect start to Ivy League play and defeated Dartmouth, 16-7, on Saturday afternoon at Harvard Stadium.
After the Big Green (1-4, 0-1 Ivy) dug the Crimson an early 2-0 hole in the first quarter, Harvard (5-3, 2-0) embarked on a 7-1 run over the next 15 minutes.
“I thought we responded really well at the end of the first quarter,” Crimson coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “We came out hot, put in two quick goals, and wound up outscoring them, 7-1, in the second quarter.”
In a game filled with scoring streaks, the Crimson’s defense held strong on the man down to blank the Dartmouth attack on all five of the visitor’s power play opportunities. On the other end, Harvard went 4-of-6 on the extra man opportunities to pull away from the team that finished last in the Ivy League last season.
Harvard’s offense showed its strength and depth with 10 different players scoring for the Crimson. Sophomore attackman Will Walker paced the home team with a career-high five goals on six shots to reach 18 scores on the season. Classmate Sean Mahon chipped in two.
The physical play of senior midfielder Brian O’Toole helped spark the Crimson offense in the second quarter. After a goal from Walker 25 seconds into the period cut the Big Green’s lead in half, O’Toole landed a hit on Dartmouth junior defenseman Robert Osgood to gain possession of the ball, and found sophomore attackman Devin Dwyer on a cross-field pass to tie the game.
Moments later, on the next Harvard attack, O’Toole shook off a hit before launching a bullet from 15 yards out to give the Crimson the lead.
The second stanza also saw Harvard take advantage of a prolonged man-up situation. A pair of one-minute penalties on Dartmouth sophomore midfielder Cam Lee for unsportsmanlike conduct and an illegal body check would facilitate two more Crimson goals.
“Our transition midfield played their hearts out,” Wojcik said. “Our long stick [midfielders] Breit and Brian Fischer [as well as] our short sticks, such as [senior] Pat Fiorvanti and O’Toole, don’t get the credit [on the stat sheet] that they deserve…. Those guys are really unsung heroes for our team.”
Harvard started slow in the second half, as Dartmouth closed the gap to 7-4 before the Crimson added three goals near the end of the contest to extend its lead to six.
While the Big Green netted another two goals in the span of 40 seconds in the final stanza, a 6-1 run by Harvard over the last 13 minutes of play clinched the victory in a game that saw the Crimson struggle to obtain consistency.
“Late in the [half] we slowed our play,” Walker said. “We [have to] finish every quarter and really start playing a complete game.”
While the Harvard offense clicked on Saturday, the team’s defense also stepped up despite the absence of co-captain and defenseman Joe Petrucci, who was out for the second straight game with a concussion. Harvard held Dartmouth to just seven goals despite the Big Green outshooting the Crimson, 36-35. Junior goalkeeper Jake Gambitsky had 10 saves for the home team.
While the scoreboard indicated an easy victory for Harvard, the stat sheet told a different story.
The Crimson struggled on the ground game, losing the ground ball battle, 30-28, against a physical Big Green squad. Dartmouth also finished the match with a 14-12 advantage in face-offs.
Harvard also struggled with turnovers throughout the match, giving the ball up a season-high 19 times.
“We’re definitely not happy only eight games in[to the season],” co-captain midfielder Peter Schwartz said. “Every game you try to reach that point where you can play a complete 60 minutes…. We can [also] improve on decision making. In transition, when they were [putting pressure on us], we were a little flat footed and they took advantage of it.”
Though the win might not have been the prettiest of triumphs for the Crimson, Wojick was pleased with the final result.
“Overall, what we saw was a good conditioning level,” Wojick said. “Athleticism [was seen] across the board, and we executed and hit our shots. To win by nine goals in the Ivy League is very difficult, so ultimately I’m happy with the score [even if not] completely happy with how we got there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sophomore Todd Preston’s run to the quarterfinals was the highlight of Harvard’s appearance in the NCAA Championships. Represented by Preston and junior James Fox, the Crimson wrestling team managed to tally two points on the weekend, finishing tied for 58th place finish out of the 72 teams in competition at the tournament in the Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City. Penn State won the championships with a combined 109.5 points, edging out Minnesota by five and a half points.
“It wasn’t the result that we wanted, not getting an All-American,” Fox said. “But this is the national tournament. The level of wrestling out here is the best in the country. It’s absolutely insane.”
Preston entered as the 10th seed in the 141-pound weight class in the tournament. In the quarterfinals, the sophomore found himself pitted against the No. 2 seed Logan Stieber, the two-time 133-pound NCAA champion from last season hailing from Ohio State. With 1:29 remaining in the match, Stieber was able to maneuver adeptly and pin the sophomore, ending the match in favor of the Buckeyes and sending Preston to the consolation bracket.
“I fell short of my goals by one match,” Preston said. “But I proved a lot to myself. I proved that I’m up there with the best kids in the country.”
Preston still had a chance to advance through wrestlebacks after his loss to Stieber.  In the first round, Preston was pitted against the No. 13 seed Stephen Dutton of Michigan. The Wolverine emerged victorious after a 2-1 decision in his favor, ending Preston’s hopes of standing upon the podium at the end of tournament.
“I was just one point away from achieving my life-long goal of being an All-American,” Preston said. “But sometimes that’s a good thing—to fall short of your goals—just to fuel the fire to come back stronger next year.”
Although Preston failed in his upset attempt against Stieber, the sophomore fared better in the round of 16 against No. 7 seed Zach Horan of Central Michigan, to whom he had lost to in the past. Preston handily defeated the redshirt sophomore, 6-2, landing him in a match against Stieber.
“I knew what his offense was going to be and I planned accordingly,” Preston said. “I controlled the match, controlled the pace, and came out on top.”
Preston opened the weekend with a much tighter match.  After giving up a takedown early in the match, the sophomore was able to get by Daniel Neff of Lock Haven in overtime, edging the redshirt sophomore in tiebreakers, 7-4, to avoid a first-round exit.
“Being able to come out for NCAAs was just a great opportunity,” Preston said. “There is no professional wrestling. This is as big as it gets. It’s a lot of fun. [There’s] a lot of fans and it gets loud in there.”
Harvard junior James Fox , wrestling at 197 pounds, was Harvard’s other wrestler that made the trip to Oklahoma City.
The third-year standout started the first match in control against No. 8 Phillip Wellington of Ohio, pancaking his opponent to the mat to grab an early lead. Despite entering the final period with the lead, he gave up a reversal with Wellington starting the period on bottom, conceding the lead that he was unable to recover, and falling 6-5.
This marks the second year that Wellington was able to knock off Fox in the first round of the competition. Both wrestlers were unranked in last year’s tournament.
“This is definitely a tournament where sometimes it’s just the luck of the draw,” Fox said. “You can get a good road and have a good tournament and … be right there on the podium or sometimes you meet some a couple people when it’s not your day and you lose some close matches.”
Fox again got off to a fast start in his consolation match against No. 9 Christian Boley of Maryland. But the junior got caught on his back, conceding five points to the Terrapin as he fell to Boley, 9-3.
“It’s tough when you give up five points against guys at this level,” Fox said. “It’s really hard to battle back from.”
Harvard’s 58th place finish is a drop off from last year’s 41st place finish. The team managed to garner four points with three wrestlers last season.
This marks the fourth straight year that the Nittany Lions have taken home the NCAA Championships title. Penn State and Minnesota led the field with seven All-American finishes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sophomore Danielle Lee is used to setting and breaking records.
When the Crimson swimmer helped her team win an Ivy League Championship a month ago, she broke the conference record for her 400-medley relay performance with a time of 52.77 seconds, and set a new record for Harvard too.
This past weekend Lee proved her times weren’t a fluke. The only Harvard woman to compete at the NCAA Division I Swimming and Diving Championships, Lee swam personal bests in the 100 and 200 backstroke events, in addition to the 100 butterfly.
“It was an honor to represent Harvard,” said Lee, who was one of five Ivy League competitors at the meet. “Being able to just qualify for NCAAs is a great accomplishment and being able to represent Harvard was a bonus.”
Lee and her coach Stephanie Wriede Morawski ’92 were impressed and honored to have participated in the national meet that featured the best swimmers in the country and many of the fastest in the world.
“It’s a big scene,” Morawski said. “There are people walking around with the Olympic tattoos all over them. Every Olympian is practically here; so are the NCAA Champions. The best of the best are here. And so is Danielle Lee, and this is her first chance.”
Lee opened with the butterfly on Friday, finishing the first day of competition with the 100 backstroke. Though she did not place high enough to medal, her best times are ahead, according to Morawski.
“Danielle learned a lot and will know what to expect from the meet and the environment next year,” Morawski said. “Also, swimming a personal best in the morning bodes well for the future.”
While NCAA competitors typically race once per day, Lee chose to compete in the 100 butterfly in addition to her specialty backstroke events. The sophomore swam in the 100 and 200 backstroke events at three dual meets this year, winning the race each time.
“I’m very happy in hindsight that she did it because it got out some of the prerace jitters,” Morawski said. “Her kicks weren’t pulling her out ahead like they did in the Ivy League. I think it opened her eyes that you can say all you want, but this is a different scene and until you get in there and compete against those people it’s hard to really put yourself in that position.”
But after finishing her 100 butterfly, Lee was ready to go. With back-to-back events, the sophomore had little time to rest in between, yet returned for the 100 backstroke to place 32nd with a time of 53.39. On Saturday, Lee placed 30th in the 200 backstroke with a time of 1:55.70.
“I was incredibly impressed by her poise,” Morawski said of Lee’s second swim on Friday. “She shook off the first race, loosened up, and came back for the second one. Swimming is very mental. You need your brain to say ‘keep going, keep moving; do not stop no matter how much you hurt, just go faster.’ And that’s hard to make your body do, and she did it.”
Lee was just one member of a young team full of promising freshmen and sophomores this season, all prepared to continue the Crimson legacy in the future.
“If nothing else, it’s a great experience just being at this meet,” Morawski said. “We’re happy to be here and she’ll come back next year and know what to do.”
“Coming into NCAAs and seeing all the fast people definitely keeps me motivated and shows me that I still have work left to do,” Lee said. “I can still better my time and improve, and hopefully place higher next year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Facing its third Ivy League opponent of the season, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team was able to solidify a winning conference record in a match up against Yale.
The Crimson (4-3, 2-1 Ivy) were triumphant against the Bulldogs (5-2, 1-2) Saturday in New Haven, taking home its second win against an Ancient Eight opponent this season with the 11-8 victory. The win also brought Harvard above .500.
Once again, the Crimson’s offense was propelled by freshman goal scoring with attackers Marisa Romeo and Megan Hennessey leading the pack. Romeo had a career-high five goals in the game. The freshman leads Harvard with 22 tallies on the season and 26 points through the first seven games. During the contest Romeo also scored all three of the team’s free position shots. Hennessey put up two goals in the victory, her fourth multi-goal game this season. She added five draw controls, a season high.
The sophomore class was also well represented, with attacker Audrey Todd netting two and Alexis Nicolia adding a score of her own.
Although the Crimson was down, 2-0, to the Bulldogs early in the game, consecutive goals by Romeo and Hennessey brought them back even. Goals were traded twice before Harvard gained a 5-3 edge and went on to take 6-5 advantage into halftime.
The game remained a close competition after the half, although Harvard gained its largest lead of the game on a free position shot from Romeo with 23:45 left in the game for a 9-6 advantage. Yale battled back with two consecutive goals, but that would be all the offense the Bulldogs could muster in that half, as they were shut out for the final 11 minutes of play.
Defensively for the Crimson, sophomore goalie Kelly Weis continued to have success in the net. Weis was able to save eight of Yale’s 16 shots that made it through Harvard’s defensive line.
Harvard had the advantage in ground balls and free position shots, while also pressuring the Bulldogs to turn the ball over ten times throughout the contest. The Crimson converted more free position shots, going 3-for-6 while Yale went 2-for-7 from behind the line.
The Bulldogs did have a slight edge in draw controls, handling 11 while the Crimson was able to control ten.

We have only one glorious week of vacation in the spring, but our friends (and frenemies) at Harvard are taking full advantage of this free time with a range of destinations and activities. Here are the ten types of Harvard spring breaks.
1. Sun
It is snowing in March—people have had enough. Many want to get away from the depressing dirt-gray snow and brown, muddy grass we all walk through in the Yard (read: seasonal affective disorder). You can find these hordes of students in Mexico, Florida, and the Bahamas.
 
2. Snow
 
Some crazies are willing to sacrifice more cold and snow for an adrenaline rush (read: us). They want an action-packed ski adventure and lots of hot chocolate. You can find these goggle-tanned skiers in Vermont, Colorado, and Canada. 
 
3. Harvard-Sponsored Programs around the World
 All of a sudden, your Facebook feed is flooded with pictures of classmates in South Korea, Madrid, and Hong Kong. How did they all get there, and why are they wearing suits? Harvard organizations like Harvard Model Congress and the Harvard College in Asia Program fund student spring break trips for those who are motivated enough to get their act together and apply in the fall.
 
4. Athletics
 
Though athletes do not get a spring break, per se, many Harvard varsity sports go on team training and bonding trips. As if these teammates didn’t spend enough time together during a regular week, they now don’t have to separate for a few hours of class. For some teams, this means a trip to Texas, for others, another trip across the river.
 
5. Trip with Grandparents and Family
 
These students may be in Florida, but they are certainly not raging in Miami; rather, they’re getting a little R&R with their extended families. Boca Raton, Palm Beach, and Naples are all hot spots for the elderly, so when their grandchildren have a free week, it’s only fair they make the trip. Look out for toes-in-the-sand photos.
 
6. MIA
 
Unclear. Haven’t been responding to texts, Snapchats, or Instagram direct messages (is this still a thing?). 
 
7. Studying
 This spring break (aka early reading period) is the perfect time for some to snuggle up and finally get to the footnotes of the optional reading they have been dying to look up on JSTOR. Highlights of this week will include optional problem sets, practice problems and copious notes.
 
8. Exploring Boston
 For those who don’t want to travel too far from their nest (read: messy dorm room), exploring the area outside Harvard Square is a perfect way to spend the week. Not only does spring break coincide with Boston Restaurant Week, but being in Cambridge for St. Patrick’s Day is bound to be a treat.
9. Netflix
 
Can be done anytime, anywhere. Netflix put it best when the company tweeted: “Look outside at the beauty in nature!!! Ok now go back to Netflix. Outside is scary.” The must-watch list: “House of Cards,” “Orange Is the New Black,” “Mitt,” “The Square” and “Scandal.”
 
10. The Crimson
 
Some people never leave The Crimson. Why would spring break be any different? (@weinstock, @crimsonsports, @jobo).

What are the chances that Harvard men’s basketball can win again and beat no. 4-seed Michigan State at 8:40 p.m. tonight?
John L. Ezekowitz '13 has a number: 38 percent, approximately.
So, Crimson fans who had never heard of Spokane before this week, there's hope of Harvard advancing past the NCAA Tournament’s Round of 32 into the Sweet Sixteen.
Ezekowitz, whose predictions have been published in the Wall Street Journal three years running, wrote in an e-mailed statement that the model's outputs are based on "factors like offensive and defensive efficiency, strength of the schedule, consistency, NCAA tournament experience (NCAA games played in the prior season times returning minutes), and the number of NCAA tournament teams the team has beaten this season." Translation: You would have wanted him as your partner for your Stat 104 final project while he was an undergrad.
Ezekowitz added, "Michigan State is a tough matchup for Harvard. They are experienced, talented, and well-coached. Harvard will have to limit transition opportunities and play strong defense against Adreian Payne and Branden Dawson inside."
For anyone whose dreams of a perfect bracket are still going strong after this year’s upsets, Professor Carl N. Morris's statistical take will ground your hopes.
"Winning requires guessing at 63 games and getting them all right," Morris, the Harvard Sports Analysis Collective faculty advisor, wrote in an e-mailed statement. Do the math and the odds of a perfect bracket are about one in 100 billion.
Morris's final advice on the billion dollar perfect bracket challenge: It's "not worth taking the time to enter."
