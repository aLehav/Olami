After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four or five years ago, Will Ferrell had a spontaneous idea. He thought it might be funny to make a film in Spanish. He has realized this daydream in his new movie “Casa de mi Padre,” in which he stars as a dim-witted Mexican ranchero and stars alongside a cast of predominantly Spanish-speaking actors.
“I felt like you hadn’t seen that,” he said in an interview with The Crimson, “You hadn’t seen an American comedian really commit to a foreign-language movie.” Though “Casa” may share a loose plot formula with Ferrell’s past films, the concept presented a host of new challenges and opportunities to the experienced comedian.
Prior to starting work on “Casa,” Ferrell didn’t speak Spanish. “I didn’t want the joke of this movie to be that I spoke Spanish badly,” he said. So he had to focus a great deal on pronunciation and memorization. Even more difficult, Ferrell had to speak in Spanish while also being funny. To better express the humor of the film—and perhaps also because screenwriter Andrew Steele is American—the script was written first in English and then translated. “Once you know what you’re saying, you can put the right emphasis in the right places,” Ferrell said.
One of the film’s main sources of thematic inspiration also influenced Ferrell’s acting style. “Casa” replicates the ambiance of over-the-top, melodramatic telenovelas, commonly known as Spanish soap operas—which Ferrell claims to watch “every weekday from 11 in the morning till 4 in the afternoon.”
“I knew that the more dramatic I could be [and] the more serious I could be, that would probably be funnier,” he said. Ferrell has historically incorporated improvisation into his work, but the language barrier made spontaneity less of a possibility. “It drastically reduced moments for verbal improvisation, so I had to rely on little physical moments and reactions,” he said.
Part of Ferrell’s original idea for the movie was that he would be the only non-Mexican—or self-described “gringo”—in the cast, so in “Casa” he worked with Spanish language stars Diego Luna, Gael Garcia Bernal, and Genesis Rodrigues, who he said helped him assimilate into his character’s culture. They also gave him a more nuanced sense of Mexican humor.
“Some of the quote-unquote ‘Mexican’ comedy I’ve seen is really over the top, and yet from talking to Diego, [Mexican writers] really appreciate subtle humor,” Ferrell said. “Obviously there are going to be cultural things that you can never compare, in terms of different countries’ style of humor.” Nonetheless, he has found that certain themes and physical humor translate well.
“Casa” fits with Ferrell’s past work in that it is unexpected and somewhat experimental. “I always try to keep people guessing and mix things up a bit,” he said. Ferrell compares the film’s absurdist quality particularly to that of his 2004 hit “Anchorman.”
“[Casa] has a similar feel in a way where we sort of threw all the rules out of the window,” he said. Ferrell thinks the new film will be a pleasant surprise for his fans. Despite America’s cultural tendency of not coming out to the theaters to see foreign films with subtitles, Ferrell sees the subtitles as a something that will draw the audience in. “You really have to pay attention because it’s subtitled, so you are forced to lock into the story,” he said.
However, Ferrell is humble about his aspirations for his newest creation. “It would be hysterical to me if this movie became a little cult hit and we could make a sequel or could make like a series of them. That would be really fun,” Ferrell said. If that doesn’t work out, though, he is considering some other projects.
“There are a billion Chinese. Maybe I’ve got to do something in Chinese—that’s the next market to conquer,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A woman with steel hair risks her life, defies gravity, and hangs precariously by her precious hair—and scares the life out of her young daughter each and every time she does it. Aglaja Veteranyi’s posthumously translated semi-autobiographical novel, “Why the Child is Cooking in the Polenta,” is narrated by this unnamed child. The story follows her and her circus-performing parents as they leave Romania and travel through Europe and Africa, and slowly sheds the few bits of structure their fantastical lives had along the way. Translated by Vincent Kling, Veteranyi’s prose brings to life the unlikely perspective of this young girl, an observant yet deeply disturbed child.
Like a circus gone mad, the protagonist’s life slowly spirals out of control. Her father is a drunk who sleeps with her barely pubescent sister; her mother is often overbearingly protective but also shares in her husband’s drunken revelry, which leads her to prostitute the narrator as a child sex performer. The main character is left with few constants in her life except for her mother’s apt collection of chipped porcelain plates—beautiful yet broken—and a mythical story her sister tells her of a child who is cooked alive in polenta.
Veteranyi manages to gather together the shards of this child’s shattered life into a compelling story that describes both tragic and commonplace moments with an unrestrained, creative voice that only a child could possess. With her stream-of-consciousness writing style and poetically sparse prose, Veteranyi successfully pits the playful nature of youth against the morose reality of adult life; she provides a world of commentary through a seemingly quick glimpse of a child’s life.
She writes with deceptively simple prose, a style that her protagonist could easily speak aloud. The writing is fragmented and slightly scattered, just as a child’s thoughts are. “The car trip lasted several years,” she thinks in a realistic exaggeration. Later, she imagines her father’s native language as sounding like “bacon with peppers and sour cream.” This creative perspective, coupled with Veteranyi’s visual style—frequent line and page breaks, and sentences and phrases entirely in capitals—enhances the reality of her prose. The flow is choppy, the words broken up like real-world thoughts at different times. This loose structure and natural impression are two of the author’s greatest strengths: rather than being confusing or awkward, the protagonist’s words seem to emerge naturally even as she jumps around from subject to subject. The story reads like a narration of her life and various thoughts—everything from detailing how her mother slaughters chickens in hotel bathtubs to listing the things she likes to eat.
This straightforward chronicle gains its power from the young girl’s unique declarations about the confusing world she struggles to comprehend. “PEOPLE ARE GOOD BECAUSE THEY’RE AFRAID OF THE DEVIL,” she says at one point. It’s this tone of honesty, as if the child is sharing the things she learns without a filter, that creates a compelling world. Veteranyi’s dry humor contains the same appeal. “I’m very lucky; at least we’re rich enough that I don’t have to eat Boxi,” says the protagonist of her pet. “Anybody with a dog in Romania either lets it starve or makes soup out of it so they won’t starve themselves.”
Veteranyi’s finesse as a writer best emerges not in moments of realization or humor, but rather in those where she harnesses the unique innocent creativity of children. “MY AUNT IS LIKE MY MOTHER’S SHADOW,” she writes in the voice of the protagonist. “But she looks different in every picture, as if she were part of the landscape.” The novel is full of beautiful sentences like these, and most impressive is that she weaves them in while maintaining the protagonist’s voice.
As fragments of the protagonist’s life begin to come together, she grows up and  changes. She loses her mother’s wavering protection and her innocence. As her worldview becomes more dark and adult, her invented childhood myth—about why the child is cooking in the polenta—also changes. In the original iterations of the story when the sisters were young, the child climbs into the pot accidentally or hides in the cornmeal. Yet this story eventually comes to represent more than just a family tale. Later, as the protagonist experiences great hardship, her mindset projects itself onto the once-comforting myth: cooking becomes a punishment because the child tortures orphans and sucks the flesh off of their bones. This understated portrayal of emotional changes is an incredibly effective way to convey the emotional and physical upheaval of this young girl’s life.
The terrific tragedy of the protagonist’s life underlies every one of these themes. Within one page, her mother attempts suicide and beats her sister, who makes sure that a man impregnates her so she can escape the clutches of her incestuous father. As things get worse, her life loses structure. People become interchangeable. Her sister becomes her mother, her doll becomes her sister, and her family moves yet again. She is thrown from the itinerant lifestyle of the circus, to a boarding school, back to the circus, to a traveling sex show, to her aunt, back to school, and so forth. Yet Veteranyi is not content with shock-and-awe tragedy. She instead aims for reality.
Throughout the novel, Veteranyi describes the myriad things the circus performers collect: the children’s dolls, the mother’s porcelain plates, and the family’s memories. Yet the girl’s aunt and uncle, at the novel’s end, have accumulated a pile of possessions after settling down: carpets upon carpets, bed sheets, dead people’s clothes, an Elvis poster, and more things the protagonist has never dreamed of until the moment she sees them all. In this moment, Veteranyi gives us a snapshot of what we accumulate in our lifetimes, but throughout the novel she also reminds us that, like material possessions; we accumulate a range of influential experiences—and in this one young girl’s life, those are mostly tragedies. As the circus performers collect possessions optimistically for the day they settle in a huge house, so too can we collect the few moments of joy in the protagonist’s life, hoping she will realize that she can abandon her tragic life and settle down with these few grains of happiness. Yet Veteranyi writes on, determined to portray real emotions at the cost of her characters’ happiness, reminding us again and again of the unbearable sadness of the world.

Violent drug cartels along the United States-Mexico border might provoke images of armed, ski-masked gangsters. In “Casa de mi Padre,” the exposition of these forces come into contact with an unlikely figure: a simpleminded ranchero named Armando Alvarez (Will Ferrell). While the film could have easily been nothing more than another goofy Will Ferrell movie, it distinguishes itself through its diverse and comically gifted cast and cutting social commentary.
“Casa de mi Padre,” a comedy entirely in Spanish, is set on the Alvarez family ranch in Mexico. Armando’s newly affluent brother Raul (Diego Luna) returns from the city to aid their father, who is struggling to maintain the ranch’s finances. Following Raul’s return, however, several violent incidents—perpetrated by the drug lord Onza (Gael García Bernal)—begin to suggest that his earnings might be ill-gotten.
Though a comedy about such a grave issue can often turn insensitive and crude, “Casa de mi Padre” maintains a light, playful sense of humor that bypasses these potential pitfalls—in an exemplary scene a character is shot yet attempts to take swig after swig from his glass of scotch while falling to the ground in slow motion. The tone of the film mimics the laughable melodrama of a telenovela, with forbidden love affairs and dramatically lit close-ups of characters’ faces, but avoids any uncomfortable level of cultural parody. Added to the melodrama is the quality of the exorbitantly extravagant scenic shots, which are fresh and occasionally lovely. The sumptuous soundtrack also reinforces the overblown tone.
Much of the humor comes from this endearingly exaggerated tone, typically embodied by Ferrell’s trademark faux gravitas. Armando, a man-child whose stupidity embarrasses his family, is not a novel character for Ferrell. In fact, the character is so similar to Ferrell’s roles in movies such as “Anchorman” and “Step Brothers” that the film comes dangerously close to being merely a recreation of these characters in Spanish.
The film comes nearest to repetition of these films in scenes where Armando jokes with his equally dim-witted friends, Esteban (Efren Ramirez) and Manuel (Adrian Martinez). Ramirez and Martinez lack the honed comic timing that helps Ferrell pull off some of the less inspired jokes. Dialogues between Armando and his lover Esmeralda (Mariann Gavelo) also feel a bit tired, largely because Gavelo’s performance is not as charmingly foolish.
Ultimately, however, “Casa de mi Padre” avoids merely echoing Ferrell’s similar films because he is pushed out of English and away from perennial co-stars such as Steve Carrell and John C. Reilley. Instead, the co-stars of “Casa”—Luna and Bernal—perform with fresh comedic styles. Luna wonderfully mocks a “cool,” Antonio-Banderas-style Mexican gunslinger. Bernal’s darker and subtler performance pokes fun at a slick villain one might see in “Desperado” or “Once Upon a Time in Mexico,” at one point ridiculously holding two lit cigarettes in his mouth at once.
Some of the flatter jokes are those that seem to be funny only by extension and repetition, such as Armando cracking a bad joke and laughing idiotically for an uncomfortably long time with Esteban and Manuel. Some gags rely on purposeful failures in the set and other low-budget gimmicks that are more successful at their subtlest—using the same footage of passing a truck each time Armando and his buddies drive—and less so at their most obvious, such as a tediously long scroll of text explaining that footage of an “awesome” fight scene was lost during production.
Despite these cheap thrills, the message of “Casa” is cogent, exemplified by a fantastic dialogue that takes place between Armando and Raul wherein they discuss how Americans fear Mexican drug violence yet refuse to forgo the drugs that cause it. Armando mocks the politicians who condemn drug cartels while ignoring their heroin-addicted housewives. The root of the conflict rests with Americans. Perhaps the most poignant moment is when, in the middle of a bloody gunfight, a DEA Agent (Nick Offerman) exclaims, in English, “All this so daddy’s little girl can score a dime bag.” Despite the occasionally drawn-out or repetitive gags, “Casa de mi Padre” has some powerful moments, mostly when it ventures into such social commentary.

With a title that already hints at an inspirational story, the recent Academy Award winner for Best Documentary “Undefeated” sounds like a typically uplifting, tearjerking underdog film. However, “Undefeated” transcends this archetype with its portrayal of the 2009 football season of Manassas High School, during which the players aim to win the first playoff game in their school’s 110-year history. Although it also documents the remarkable statistical victory of a football team, “Undefeated” proves to be more than just a football documentary; it also depicts the transformation of underprivileged teens into star athletes as well as mature men of character.
“Undefeated” traffics in the classic tale of the little sports team that could, and the film makes it easy to root for the Manassas Tigers. Before its resurrection, the team would sell their home games to the highest bidder to serve as an easy defeat for other schools. But in the spring of 2004, Bill Courtney, a former high school football player and coach, volunteers to turn Manassas around. Coach Courtney trains the 17-member team by focusing more on building integrity in the young men than on winning games. In doing so, he turns them into the most brilliant team Manassas has ever had.
Set in inner-city Memphis, the film depicts the actual neighborhoods and homes from which these young men came. The movie chronicles income disparity in the United States through screenshots that capture ramshackled houses, iron-fenced parks, and unkempt streets. The camera lingers on both still and moving shots of these backgrounds, forcing the viewer to take in the full context of the film. In this way, directors Dan Lindsay and T.J. Martin add breadth to the documentation of the struggles of the inner-city teens by fully portraying the poverty of their circumstance.
Not only is the cinematography key to establishing the setting of “Undefeated,” but it also weaves into the documentary’s storyline. The way the camera focuses on the faces of team members, schoolteachers, and coaches during dialogue adds intensity to their words. The camera work emphasizes the significance of the conversations in which the coaches and schoolteachers reiterate to the young men the importance of academics. As the camera focuses on a player’s face, he fearfully asks, “Where we goin’ go after high school football?” For the Manassas players, football makes attending college possible through potential scholarships, so the players fear that if they don’t perform well enough, they will not be able to improve their economic situation. When the camera captures the player’s expression, the stark reality these young men face is evident.
To contrast the strife of the future, the camera style then changes during the football games to emphasize the spirit and breathless nature of the game. During each game, the camera swoops across the crowd, reflecting the whirling excitement both the spectators and players feel. With the games set at nighttime and the camera furiously caputing the scoreboard, the cinematography expresses the dark, hurried reality of the players’ future is on the literal and metaphorical line.
Through the Bildungsroman of the young men of the Manassas football team, the film overfills with pain and redemption. Refreshingly, football is only an auxiliary concept in this movie. As Coach Courtney states, the sport is merely a way to “reach your hearts through something you love.” At its core, “Undefeated” challenges assumptions about the potential of underprivileged teens just as Coach Courtney challenges his players to see that life, like football, is about heart and character.
“Character is not about how you handle your successes but how you handle your failures,” Courtney says. With such an in-depth portrayal of the characters and their story, “Undefeated” need not worry as it is a clear winner.

What the Harvard Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s staging of “Talk Radio” lacks in space, it makes up for in startling intensity. When the audience first take their  seats to watch  playwright Eric Bogosian’s play in the Loeb Ex, it’s as if they have wandered backstage. The seating area, which is enclosed by dark walls, fits only a few dozen audience members. This  intimate relationship between audience and cast is required for a full appreciation of the searing, in-your-face nature of this production.  The grating, unhinged voices of late night radio callers slam around in the small space, finding their match in the violent energy of their host, Barry Champlain (Phil M. Gillen ’13).  The talented and electric cast of “Talk Radio” is well complimented by the play’s inspired technical elements—especially sound and set design—and together they bolster an engaging and moving portrait of an impossible man.
“Talk Radio” follows one night of the late-hour radio program, “Night Talk with Barry Champlain,” in which Champlain mercilessly eviscerates an aural parade of psychos, sad sacks, and anti-Semites who call in with their problems. Champlain’s three-person team, Stu Noonan (Peter K. Bestoso ’14), Linda MacArthur (Vanessa B. Koo ’12), and Dan Woodruff (Matthew J. Bialo ’15), alternates between indulging Champlain’s vicious tempers, and confessing its own histories with Champlain to the audience. As the night progresses, Champlain’s show boils over into a shouting contest between his own invisible demons, and the audience sees Champlain as he truly is.
Champlain has all of the answers to the world’s most desperate and inane questions, which makes him a faceless deity for morally disenfranchised and paranoid late-night-radio listeners. Director Caleb J. Thompson ’14, a Crimson arts staff writer, and set designer Madie A. Hays ’13 have created an atmosphere that plays up Champlain’s animalistic passions and depressions by presenting him as a kind of caged beast.  Champlain is physically compressed within the small stage, and confined even more by his looming metal desk and radio equipment. Within this claustrophobic space, Gillen does a truly impressive job revealing Champlain’s bitterly disjointed moods. At times, he bellows and storms around the studio, electrifying the air with a seemingly limitless surge of caustic disgust aimed at his friends, his listeners, and himself. However, Thompson anchors him at his desk for his most terrifying and dangerous speeches. It is in these still moments that Gillen shines most brightly: his voice alone boils with rage and fear while his body stays frozen and tense behind his desk.
Champlain is at once a trembling fraud and a manic egoist, and as he vacillates between the two, those closest to him must either walk away from him for good or commit to the brutal ride. Noonan, Champlain’s longtime friend, and MacArthur, his occasional lover, are both strong foils for Gillen’s Champlain. Bestoso walks with a perpetual slouch and plays with his hair as he describes Champlain in his monologues.  Koo takes a more guarded approach, leaning back against a desk and curling her arms around herself, mirroring Champlain’s embraces as she describes them to the audience.
The show moves forward with unrelenting speed, thanks to the constant flow of late-night callers, hilariously and at times chillingly voiced by Nathan O. Hilgartner ’14, Lily R. Glimcher ’14, Rob A. Knoll ’13, and Taylor K. Phillips ’14.  One caller, a bright-eyed, drugged-up kid named Kent (Jacob A. Brandt ’14) calls in several times, spinning lies about his fictional girlfriend’s drug overdose to get Champlain’s attention. When Kent actually comes to the station to meet his idol, Brandt steals the show.  He is constantly in motion, rocking back in his folding chair, flapping his hands in Champlain’s face, and speaking a mile a minute while somehow maintaining his drugged-up slur. The pair play off each hilariously: after one of Brandt’s lengthy, disconnected discourses on America, Gillen tries to level him with his standard tone of jaded relish. “Kent, you’re an idiot,” he says,  practically levitating. Brandt answers with obvious delight: “Man, you’re the best!”
However, not even the effervescent presence of Brandt can lighten the mood of the play, which ultimately aims to pull the audience deep into the mind of the troubled, and troubling, Barry Champlain. “Talk Radio” is complicated work carried beautifully by an incredible cast and crew.  Thompson brings a lively, electrifying show to the audience, making us wonder long after the conclusion at the fact that a man like Champlain can exist, even in art.

“Actually, if you look closely, our ghosts are fluttering everywhere, dispersed and dispersing,” writes Dan Chaon in “Stay Awake,” an impressive and unsettling new collection of short stories. “We fall as leaves upon a human finger, curled in the grass at the edge of a house and never found, we settle as dust upon a key in a basement door that leads nowhere.” From these peculiar combinations—ordinary events made shadowy and sinister—grim and dark explorations of the world ensue. In this book, an atmospheric ode to all things disturbing, Chaon flits between the gruesome and the depressing and lingers just long enough on each story to fully realize its creepy environment. No area of existence, from the mundane to the near supernatural, is safe from the pervasive onslaught of his troubling imagination. Teenagers strain against small-town lives, and a recovering addict tries to escape his past; elsewhere, a two-headed child is born, and a man realizes he may be dead. Across a wide variety of situations, however, one thing remains constant: Chaon’s mastery and manipulation of the mood of the story. This ability—to bring out the disquieting aspects in even the most commonplace of circumstances—elevates his writing to haunting heights.
In these mesmerizing and stark snapshots of various lives, Chaon conjures up dark atmospheres partially through his unique perspective on seemingly normal sights. A deadbeat young man, Brandon, contemplates mortality and growing up after his parents’ suicide in “Patrick Lane, Flabbergasted.” Yet even in the story of this ordinary character—he lives in his childhood home, works in the local supermarket, and is a self-described Internet addict—Chaon invokes unsettling tension through unconventional metaphors. Brandon sees “a kind of millipede of metal and wheels” in a chain of stacked grocery carts and “a dead spaceman” in a jumbled pile of hair dryers in an abandoned beauty salon. Bizarre descriptions like this turn an otherwise banal plot into one steeped with foreboding; the story resembles nothing less than a prelude to a ghost story. Yet, in failing to descend into a tale of the supernatural, Chaon actually casts a far more ominous net. These disturbing images in a normal setting are frightening due to their unexpected occurrence.
In other stories, however, Chaon’s creative plot elements, not his language, bring forth the collection’s signature and pervasive darkness. In the titular story “Stay Awake,” a two-headed baby is born after a long, difficult conception process. Her parents must face the ethical repercussions of removing the extra head from the “host” body. Spine-chilling imagery abounds—the attached head lies awake at night, unblinking, stealing the life from its host—and at the story’s end, the father wonders if his baby will grow up with the ghost of the removed head forever haunting her. “Hello, a voice would say. I’m still here. I’m still with you,” Chaon writes in the disembodied voice of the amputated head. “Rosalie…I’m still awake.”
When Chaon is not exploring the grotesque and uncanny, however, he turns to toxic family situations—a subject that, surprisingly, lends itself well to this morbid story collection. Parents abandon children, a couple copes with the death of their newborn, adopted children try to reconnect with their fragmented pasts, and a widower spirals into despair as he grieves. Though these stories are all tinged with vague supernatural trepidation, their most affecting aspects—especially when taken as a whole—are the tenuous and oft-destructive relationships between humans. Chaon manages to imbue stories of abandonment and loneliness with the same level of compelling darkness as his more fantastical stories. The haunted solitude of the human mind becomes just as disturbingly fascinating as the world of spirits.
Fear, Chaon suggests, can take many forms. In “Thinking of You in Your Time of Sorrow,” the narrator is secretly relieved when his newborn son dies, for he is a teenage father unable and unwilling to care for a child and wants to experience a wider world beyond his small hometown. Yet he cannot stop dwelling what his life would have been like with a child: “If Caleb had lived, would Meg have hated him as much as your mom hates you?” Chaon writes as the young narrator questions his existence. “Would you have become an old drunk, like your dad? Does everything perpetuate itself?” Fear, here, is more than wind whistling through an abandoned house; it becomes the realistic and painful fear of being trapped in one life and desperately wanting to escape.
Across the impressive variety of stories contained in “Stay Awake,” Chaon hints at, more than completely exposes, the eeriness hidden in situations both commonplace and absurd. He inextricably links disparate stories through a complicated web of theme and atmosphere. Some characters are uncannily similar, situations recur with slight variations, and sometimes, the very nature of life and death is obscured. “The dream disappeared,” Chaon writes, “and yet a little scrap of it hung above him, like a little ragged strip of cloth caught on a barbed-wire fence.” It may be difficult to pinpoint exactly where these stories veer from reality to dreams, yet they ensure you, too, will stay awake.

Glengarry Glen Ross
March 23-31, 7:30 p.m.,
March 24, 31 2:30 p.m., 7:30 p.m.
Loeb Ex
Directed by Benjamin A. Silva ’14
Produced by Civry P. Melvin ’14
In the world of real estate, you have to be smooth if you want to make an impact,  and David Mamet’s Pulitzer Prize-winning play about the industry, “Glengarry Glen Ross,” will smooth-talk its way into the Loeb Ex from March 22 to 31. When the production first appeared on Broadway in 1984, critics praised how the simple but striking dialogue conveyed the frustrations and anxieties of four Chicago real estate salesmen, and HRDC director Benjamin A. Silva ’14 is set on keeping the good praise coming.
“In general, my philosophy on a great work of theater is that, if it is enough to stand the test of time, you should really be faithful to the author,” Silva says. “I was drawn to the source material so much that I want to honor it as much as possible.” What he keeps is the stinging, idiomatic language that made the complicated relationships between coworkers at real estate firm  “Mitch and Murray” so engrossing for audiences when the show first premiered.
The show in part revolves around young upstart Ricky Roma (Adam J. Conner ’14) and his washed-up mentor “Shelly” Levene (Daniel W. Erickson ’14.) “While [Roma] comes off as very friendly sometimes…he’s really just trying to further his own personal goals, almost like a modern-day, mammoth form of Iago from ‘Othello.’ This guy’s a dangerous character, and I wanted to see what I could do with him,” says Conner. Roma embodies the ideal of smooth-talking deceit and is the rising star in the office. Meanwhile, the burnt-out Levene represents the obsolescence of the firm’s older generation. “Getting that sense of maturity and having an entire life behind you that has eaten you apart while still trying to keep the same amount of energy going…it’s just something that I didn’t think I would have the capacity to channel,” says Erickson. “It’s just different than anything I’ve ever done.”
Silva, however, is not afraid of adding a personal touch. He includes two musical interludes, absent from the original production, that aim to capture what he feels is at the heart of the production. “[The office] just gets completely torn in this fantasy sequence, which shows a little bit more of the office life these guys have and the frustration that it builds,” says Silva.
With its combination of old and new material, “Glengarry Glen Ross” aims to recreate the show’s original impact. The question is, can it close?

Like so many other popular phrases of politically incorrect origin, the word ‘gyp,’ meaning to cheat or swindle, originated from a suspicion of Gypsy, or Romani, populations. For centuries, governments who disdained their unorthodox ways forced the traditionally nomadic group to assimilate. Yet, just as public opinion has historically lead to a distrust of Gypsies, a recent crop of works about the lives of modern Gypsies—from the Katona József Theatre’s production of “Gypsies” at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. last week, to the autobiography “Gypsy Boy” by Mikey Walsh, to the reality TV program “My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding”—all portray Gypsies as a population equally likely to distrust “gorjios,” or outsider non-Gypsies.
In Scottish writer Stef Penney’s latest novel “The Invisible Ones,” Leon Wood, a Gypsy, wants to investigate his daughter Rose’s disappearance but will only place his trust in a fellow Gypsy. Enter Ray Lovell, a half-Romani private investigator who assimilated years ago into “gorjio” society. He soon sets off to figure out exactly how and why Rose disappeared. Seven years before the story picks up, Rose got married to the dark and handsome Ivo Janko in an arranged marriage. Their first son, Christo, inherited the family disease—presumably hemophilia—and shortly thereafter Rose vanished. In order to solve this mystery, Ray must investigate not only the facts of her disappearance but also her entire family. The novel maintains a unique focus on the sinister and enchanting life of a Romani family struggling to maintain its traditional way of life in the face of an encroaching world, yet unfortunately, it inches away from this compelling premise towards an overly prolonged resolution.
Penney alternates perspectives between Ray and James “JJ” Janko, Rose’s inquisitive 14-year-old nephew. The novel, set in England in the 1980s, opens with Ray lying in a hospital bed, paralyzed and unable to remember the events that led to his crippling accident. The story gets off to a slow start after this clichéd opening scene, and the narrative tends to drag as Penney sets up the two closely related mysteries of Rose’s disappearance and Ray’s hospitalization. She floats in and out of the private lives of Ray and JJ, but does not pick up the pace until the last third of the novel. Though the diversions give a sensitive glimpse into this family’s life, the main mysteries are solved abruptly in clever yet far-fetched gestures, which ultimately depletes their gratification. Penney proves, however, remarkably adept at sincerely capturing the Romani way of life. JJ’s great-uncle and Rose’s father-in-law, Tene Janko, poetically describes his mindset one night to Ray: “Can you imagine Tene Janko in a house? Little brick box in a row of brick boxes? It would be putting me in my coffin. It would be my death… ‘Assimilation,’ they call it. Annihilation, more like.” Statements like this perfectly encapsulate the romanticized image of the Gypsy mentality, yet Penney manages to pull them off with noteworthy truth and relatability.
The most heartfelt aspect of the novel occurs in the life of JJ, who not only struggles to fit in at school but also must search for his absent father and care for his sick family members. He recounts with embarrassment the one time he ever brought a girl from school back to his trailer: She was shocked by the lack of privacy and even more shocked by the single outdoor bathroom. “We’re like trains on tracks that run more or less parallel but will never meet,” he says, commenting on their apparent similarities yet fundamental differences. “I can’t go on her tracks, and she can’t go on mine.” Penney’s talent as a writer is apparent in the integrity of JJ’s voice; his lively and rebellious young perspective is eminently more compelling than Ray’s depressing life.
While fascinating, instants like these take up far too much space for the sparsely scattered hints and red herrings they contain, especially in a novel that is so clearly posited as a mystery story. There are moments when Penney’s writing itself seems to be stalling the plot. For example, as Ray stands on a swampy former campsite known as Black Patch—potentially the site of Rose’s disappearance—he thinks, “Whatever happened to Rose, I have to find out. Whatever hidden current took her, it must be under the surface still. ‘Are you Rose?’ I say softly but out loud. If you are here, tell me. Give me a sign.” Moments like this fail to add substantive mystery to Penney’s story. The hackneyed image of a detective speaking aloud to the missing person hardly seems necessary. It is already apparent that Ray is desperately seeking answers at this juncture, and this aside is distracting and clunky.
But perhaps it is narrow-minded to dismiss Penney’s slow pacing as a flaw; it might have been a calculated move on her part to distinguish this novel from other detective fiction. A case that involves gypsies is unlike any other. The usual reservoirs of information—national and civic records, the testimonies of neighbors and acquaintances—simply do not exist in the investigation of a population constantly under the radar and on the move. If Penney set out to mimic her main characters’ frustration in order to distinguish this novel from others in its genre, she has indeed succeeded.
Intriguing though this idea is, for the novel to ultimately succeed, the overdrawn frustrations and tensions would have to resolve themselves with a conclusion so memorable as to make the wait worthwhile. While the ending is an admittedly interesting twist, it appears as a mere flourish at the end of an exhausting investigation and its taxing diversions. There is a lot that is worthwhile in this novel; with better pacing it would be engaging and enjoyable, and with half the length, it could have triumphed.

“Matthew, am I really alive? Don’t laugh at me—I have never known,” says Victoria, a survivor of the Armenian genocide, to her great grandson in the bizarre dreamscape that serves as the end of “Deported / a dream play.” Written by Joyce Van Dyke and running until April 1 at The Modern Theatre at Suffolk University and directed by Judy Braha, the play follows Victoria (Bobby Steinbach) as she encounters the ghosts of her past and confronts the unknown—or rather, the purposefully forgotten. Though it tackles a subject overflowing with emotional power, “Deported” at times suffers from acting that is unable to do the theme justice. Occasionally, however, the actors, directing, and technical elements come together in both comic splashes and tender emotional portrayals that bring to life unimaginable tragedies and underscore the importance, in Victoria’s mind, of remembering the past.
The action in “Deported” centers around the memories that follow Victoria until she finally decides to explore her own past before her life draws to a close. Victoria recounts the traumas of her late compatriot Varter (Jeanine Kane) to Shoshana, (Liz Hayes) a student compiling an archive of the genocide in a society chocked full of genocide deniers. In the process, Victoria faces her own memories for the first time. Her culture, the horrors of war, and a family that she has blocked from her memory for years resurface in her mind, and she is confronted with the challenge of forgiving. It is a touching reminder of how the past haunts the present, however “Deported” unfolds into a confusing and tedious  staging of a dream that the actors attempt to buoy but cannot save.
Even in moments in which the script is well written, however, the actors occasionally falter. In the beginning of the play, many of the lead actors have trouble getting on their feet, leaving the play lethargic in some of its potentially brightest moments. Varter’s ghost  visits Victoria for the first time, and the two argue about the past. “You can sit there making lace until doomsday. You still wont exist,” says Steinbach sharply. The scene should be wrought with emotional tension—the woman Victoria once worked so hard to save has returned, begging to be saved again, begging to be remembered. Victoria struggles in script, yet Steinbach does not mimic this emotional complexity. Steinbach’s actions are sure, while her words seem uncertain. Gone is the confusion that plagues the character, present is only the decision to expel her past.
While Ken Baltin, who plays Victoria’s husband among other things, also suffers from this single mindedness at the outset, the supporting actors (most notably Marya Lowry), lighting design (John Malinowski), and scene design (Jon Savage) are strong from the start. The stage’s metallic background reflects a cold blue light in harsh moments and glows gold with warm lighting in scenes where Victoria is happily performing as an actress in her new life. Malinowski and Savage complement one another creatively throughout the play, enhancing the best of its moments.
Equally creative is director Judy Braha’s decision to clear the stage not with black-clad stagehands but rather with dancers draped in white robes who twirl around in full sight between and even during scenes. Like the ghosts rearranging Victoria’s life, the dancers rearrange the furniture on set. While this decision adds to the play’s fluidity and drama, elsewhere the direction is less apt. Most notable is the play’s ending dream sequence; though already written to be unfortunately long, the scene’s flaws are exacerbated by a lack of emotional and physical movement.
“Deported” has moments of true strength, such as those in which the actors execute the well-written portions of the play with precision. The most consistent of these are the moments of humor, in which all of the actors regularly deliver their lines well, waiting just long enough for the punch line and capturing the old-world humor of some of their jokes for a new-world audience.
The actors do moments of tragedy well, too. Lowry, who plays a variety of supporting roles, is consistently able to infuse her characters with the tension or torment appropriate to each specific scene. When she plays a Turkish politician’s wife and denier of the genocide whose daughter has been murdered, she wrings her hands and swings her body as she speaks. “What did my daughter do?” she asks. She turns to the audience, eyes full of a mother’s grief. “It’s all lies,” she exclaims, claiming sympathy that is unexpected for one of the story’s villains. Baltin and Steinbach succeed as well, especially in the middle of the play, as they share the worst of the tragedies that befall them and their friends and family.
“What am I doing? I told you not to come back. I have my own life!” Victoria exclaims in an attempt to push away the ghosts of her past as they enter her life in the beginning of the play. “Deported” enters modern lives with the story of a genocide and the importance of remembering, and—though shaky and flat at times—refuses to be pushed away.

Just earlier this year, The Shins seemed to be a thing of the past. The fervent endorsement of the band by Natalie Portman’s character in the independent movie “Garden State, ” which couldn’t help but heighten its popularity, will hit its tenth anniversary next year. “Wincing the Night Away” was released in 2007 amid well-deserved hype, and the band seemed poised to enter the upper echelons of rock greatness. However, each subsequent year passed by without another release. When frontman James Mercer took time to collaborate with Danger Mouse in forming the successful electronic duo Broken Bells, a new Shins album seemed unlikely. But the band has released the anticipated “Port of Morrow,” an album that is equally unassuming and detail-ridden. After a five-year drought, “Port of Morrow” is, as Mercer puts it in “September,” “a curse undone.”
“Port of Morrow” demands attention right from the album’s opening notes—robotic bleeps interspersed with pulsing keyboards and soaring synths. “The Rifle’s Spiral,” the first song, is a high-energy set of philosophical ramblings appropriate for a large concert hall. Where early 2000s Shins blended cheery harmonizing with silly lyrics about dodos and onions that exposed a childish sensibility, the new Shins have returned with a chip on its collective shoulder. Despite its chipper tempo and heavy tambourine use, the track is rife with gloomy, existential musings: “You’re not invisible now / you just don’t exist” and “You were always to be a dagger floating straight to their heart.” If anything, “The Rifle’s Spiral” is proof that a tambourine and a sense of despondency can coexist well.
The Shins continue to wed apocalyptic lyrics with laid-back instrumentation throughout, but the band loses some energy in the middle of the album. Eighth track “For a Fool,” which contains unexpectedly melodramatic lines like, “If I still fight, it’s just that I’m afraid I’ll slide under that spell again,” is a lazy track that plods along with lethargic guitars and subdued vocals. Similarly sluggish guitar and drum work a pervade a good deal of the tracks from the middle of the album, and The Shins lose the captivating energy that drove earlier hits like “Phantom Limb” and “Australia” from “Wincing the Night Away.”
Thankfully, the band regains its jolly irreverence on upbeat tracks like “No Way Down” and “Simple Song.” “No Way Down” is a toe-tapping pop gem; with its catchy hooks and pared down melodies, the song’s tongue-in-cheek lyrics are also a welcome return to The Shins’ brand of happy sarcasm. And the band hits its high point on the album’s first single, “Simple Song.” Despite its misleading title, the track is replete with soaring harmonies and layered instrumentals that support Mercer’s powerful vocals. “Simple Song” is part poetic chronicle, part advice column; youthful reminiscences like “When I was just nine years old, I swear that I dreamt / Your face on a football field and a kiss that I kept / Under my vest” go arm in arm with displays of sympathy along the lines of “I know that things can get rough when you go it alone.”
“Port of Morrow’s” eponymous closer is representative of the album’s depth and curious dichotomies. The song combines warm, building harmonies with surprisingly emo lyrics: “How many times did you try to stop the bleeding with a knife?” The Shins have returned with a bittersweet complexity in their sound that mixes strains of harshness and sophistication into the band’s expected brand of cheeriness. “Is it all so very simple?” Mercer croons on “40 Mark Strasse.” The many complexities of “Port of Morrow” answer Mercer’s own question with a resounding “no.”

Dan Auerbach, one half of the blues-rock duo The Black Keys, steadies his guitar and launches the Keys into the 2003 song “Thickfreakness.” Auerbach’s riff dominates the track. He cuts off or draws out notes to accentuate the song’s ugly swagger, and he applies touches of vibrato to inject a fierce volatility. He shifts gears—he slips from the lurching riff into a spiky high-low pattern, then hits the chorus with three heavy chords. Auerbach knows his way around an electric guitar, and stellar musicianship like this powered the Keys’ Mar. 7 show at TD Garden. Auerbach, Keys drummer Patrick Carney, and opener Arctic Monkeys delivered highly skillful performances that were weakened slightly by a mild lack of spontaneity and verve.
Arctic Monkeys’ set relied heavily on the band’s older material, and the British rockers nailed these complex songs with precision and vigor. Drummer Matt Helders opened the set with the thunderous tom-and-snare workout on “Brianstorm.” The others pounded out jagged bass and guitar lines, then chased antic, interlocking riffs through “This House Is A Circus” and “Still Take You Home.” The band shared the stage well—one instrument after the next would emerge dominant and then drop back into the band’s layered sound. The set displayed the intricacy in Arctic Monkeys’ older material, and these songs brought out the band’s striking musicianship.
The quartet played its renditions faithfully, but with endearing enthusiasm and personal flair. This energy came primarily from frontman Alex Turner, who head banged jokingly, jumped from amps, fell to his knees for guitar solos, and teased the “people in the back” throughout. In fine vocal form, Turner sang crisply and forcefully—his eerie insistence charged the otherwise unimpressive “R U Mine?” However, much of  Arctic Monkeys’ new material, including songs “Suck It and See” and “Don’t Sit Down ‘Cause I’ve Moved Your Chair,” suffered from repetitive chord progressions only slightly remedied by Turner’s half-engaged vocals. These few tracks felt weak in a performance marked by expert instrumentalism and displays of Turner’s oversized personality.
In its decade-long career, The BlackKeys has moved from raw blues to more richly produced, instrumentally varied rock. The duo’s set spanned that musical history and showed off both members’ skill. The band kicked off with newer material, and Carney took the lead on songs like “Howlin’ for You” and “Run Right Back.” His beats offered little variation from the record cuts, but deft snare work captured the songs’ moody swing—he drove “Howlin’” with a whip-crack downbeat, and his lighter touch on “Dead and Gone” kept the snare pulse bouncy instead of bombastic. Auerbach’s sharp riffs rebounded against Carney’s rhythms, and backing musicians contributed bass and keyboard to denser songs without eclipsing the duo.
Six songs in, the backing band left the pair alone on stage, and Auerbach’s guitar drove renditions of older Keys songs. Instrumental breaks in “Thickfreakness” found him spilling out descending riffs and grinding chord progressions. On “Your Touch,” he inserted a high, skittering solo before crashing back into the hook. He and Carney matched each other’s moves with a seasoned fluidity—Auerbach would smoothly switch up his guitar line after Carney pounded out a fill, or Carney would delay a snare beat to strike on the last note of a riff.
But despite the band’s technical proficiency and sheer energy, Auerbach’s performance initially lacked in raw emotion. Though his ragged voice packed an impressive range, it rarely shuddered or howled in the set’s earlier songs. He and Carney broke into no extended jams on these performances; in a short a freeform segment of “Girl Is On My Mind,” he meandered through brief, quiet guitar doodles.
Then came “Ten Cent Pistol,” a four-minute tale of murderous revenge against a cheating lover. At the final verse, a single spotlight struck Auerbach, who stared intensely into space. He whined the last lines with pained desperation—“‘Cause a jealous heart / did retaliate”—and the Keys jammed the song to a soft finish, Auerbach jerkily muttering the final line. The song’s intensity was carried through the rest of the Keys’ set. Auerbach’s voice trembled on the line “I wanted love / I needed love” as the band charged through “Tighten Up.” He bawled and stuttered his lines on closer “Lonely Boy,” and the song’s faster, sloppier instrumentation matched his tone perfectly. These exhilarating final renditions highlighted the emotional thrust that earlier songs lacked.
The three-song encore brought everything together. Auerbach turned the gritty stomp of “Everlasting Light” into a ballad, complete with delicate falsetto and a disco ball over the stage. Then the pair barreled through the weighty “She’s Long Gone” and jammed on “I Got Mine,” Auerbach strutting through his riffs and Carney chugging out a machine-gun snare line. The Black Keys may have begun their careers as two boys from Ohio, but especially in these final songs, they showed their continuing maturation as rock musicians.

“We have a lovely show planned for you tonight,” said MUTEMATH frontman Paul Meany awkwardly into the microphone at the House of Blues on March 7. Meany and the rest of the band appeared to be nervous early on, and their first few songs sounded stiff. However, the band started to communicate with the audience and each other, and the energy level escalated throughout until the raucous encore, “Typical.” By the end of the night, MUTEMATH had ignited an initially listless crowd and asserted its expertise in fusing blues into earth-tone alternative rock.
MUTEMATH arrived on stage impeccably polite and well dressed. Set up in a horizontal line, they mostly just stared ahead into the audience for the first few songs. The rendition of the band’s latest single, “Blood Pressure,” was a very tight if perfunctory version of the recording. The band rushed through several more songs from the album with little direction, and the crowd became a little restless, openingly having conversations with each other over the music.
Towards the end of the first hour, however, the band members made a more conscious effort to use the space and interact with each other. Bassist Roy Mitchell-Cárdenas dropped his instrument to bang furiously on a bass drum. Later, all four members of the band clustered around the drum set, whacking away at its various pieces. Meany got up on his organ several times to do handstands and flips, and guitarist Todd Gummerman, not to be outdone, climbed up as well and leaped triumphantly on a drum break.
The musical fervor and chemistry of MUTEMATH guaranteed that the band’s theatrics weren’t empty showmanship. On “All Or Nothing,” Meany’s falsetto soared over a U2-esque groove with ringing guitar notes and a pounding bass. And at the end, “Typical” looked and sounded exactly how an encore is supposed to. The song began with a huge guitar riff and turned into a huge sing-along; at just the right places, confetti shot into the air. Afterwards, the band members came to the very front of the stage to shake the hands of clamoring audience members. The band’s stiffness had given way to a warm intimacy. MUTEMATH may have used many typical gimmicks to ignite the crowd, but the show ended up being undeniably energetic and refreshing.

Many listeners first heard the Blind Boys of Alabama sing on “Way Down in the Hole,” the jaunty theme song of TV series “The Wire.” But for this storied gospel group, the theme song is just a footnote in a long and accomplished career. The Blind Boys of Alabama have won five Grammys, performed for three different U.S. presidents, collaborated with the likes of acclaimed singer-songwriters Ben Harper and Solomon Blake, and earned entry into the Gospel Hall of Fame.  Through over 70 years of song, the multigenerational group has never strayed from its gospel roots. According to lead singer Jimmy Carter, the group has one aim: “We just want to make you feel the spirit of the living Lord.” The Blind Boys of Alabama will perform at the Berklee Performance Center on March 23rd at 8 pm.
The group formed at the Alabama Institute for the Negro Blind in the small town of Talladega, Alabama, and consisted of five singers and an acoustic guitar.  The band was actively involved in the civil rights movement in the ’60s, performing at benefits for Martin Luther King, Jr., and gained a wider audience in the ’80s for involvement in the play “The Gospel at Colonus.”
Today, the Blind Boys of Alabama are a full gospel band of vocalists and instrumentalists, many of whom are blind. They group is currently on tour for their latest album release, “Take the High Road.” It is famous for its more modern collaborations because, unlike the members of other traditional gospel groups, Jimmy Carter and other group members believe that the essence of gospel is found in the message of the songs, not the style. They have recorded collaborations in genres ranging from reggae to rock to country. However, they still consider themselves to be true to the gospel spirit. “We are a traditional Gospel group,” Carter said. “Nothing but.”
Carter has taken the reigns from original lead singer and founding member Clarence Fountain and has been spreading the gospel message with the Blind Boys of Alabama since he was a teenager. Carter lived in Boston for much of his life and looks forward to returning for the group’s upcoming concert.

The Hiphop Archive looks less like a research space and more like a well-kept living room. The walls are lined with numerous display cases, one for VHS tapes, one for books, and one for action figures. Sleeves of old vinyl hip-hop records run along the baseboards.
A big couch and a couple of chairs face a large flat-screen television. A few of the archive’s student research assistants lounge around, writing papers on their laptops or listening to hip-hop. Above the television, on a shelf, sits a collection of iconic hip-hop paraphernalia: a turntable, multicolored cans of spray paint, a boom box. A fully functional DJ station resides in one corner.
The space is, in short, hip. It feels perfectly suited for the work its researchers are doing: It is not so buttoned up as to be stifling, nor is it relaxed enough to imply that what goes on here is anything less than serious scholarship.
It may seem incongruous to devote an academic research center to a popular art form such as hip-hop, but the location of the Hiphop Archive itself is even more so: Harvard University. The Hiphop Archive ultimately raises question about the art form itself. What lies beneath the surface of this popular entertainment to merit such focus? Why does the Hiphop Archive belong within the ivy-covered walls of Harvard?
FEMINIST FEMCEES
A slideshow on the wall of Ticknor Lounge scrolls through pictures of female hip-hop artists. Some are posed modestly, like Queen Latifah, and others provocatively, like Nicki Minaj.
This display is the background for a discussion entitled “Feminism and Hip-hop,” hosted by the Association of Black Harvard Women, Latinas Unidas de Harvard College, and the Harvard College Women’s Center. The event is a part of Women’s Week 2012 and exemplifies the type of scrutiny that hip-hop receives at Harvard. The genre is typically examined through the lens of another theory; this afternoon, it is feminism.
Marcyliena Morgan, a professor of African and African American studies who directs the Hiphop Archive, moderates the discussion. Morgan begins the event by listing of female archetypes in hip-hop: the intelligent but frigid woman, the “sister with attitude”, the lesbian femcee. A central question underlies the discussion: How can love of hip-hop be rationalized with its rampant misogyny?
This question meets an uncomfortable pause. Morgan eases up, instead asking the students to consider what the ideal hip-hop feminist role model would be. Then the discussion takes off. The students rattle off their conceptions of this role model; she is independent, introspective; she has agency, self-respect, and confidence.
One student points out that this hypothetical woman is defined by her relationship to men. And then the discussion tackles men’s role in women’s objectification in hip-hop. The students question whether this approach—men leading efforts against misogyny—is inherently problematic or even entirely effective.
The lively discussion needs little moderation from Morgan. The students’ engagement with the topic may be due to the bare skin popping up on the wall of the lounge, but perhaps the cause for clamor is the potential for analysis and debate over rap music.
BEAT AND PULSE
Feminism is just one of many lenses used to examine hip-hop. The fields run the gamut in the social sciences and humanities, and the intersections can yield unexpected food for thought. Allyson M. Mcginty ’13, a student researcher at the Archive, is working on a junior project on homophobia and gender performance in hip-hop. Mcginty’s subject of study is probably more titillating than most: Nicki Minaj.
“I’m looking at whether Nicki Minaj’s hyper-sexuality through her body and her appearance promotes rigid gender types, and then whether that enforces ideas of homophobia within hip-hop,” Mcginty says. She is also examining Minaj’s gay male alter ego, Roman Zolanski, and whether her performance of a man plays into her hyper-sexuality or complicates it.
The overlap between hip-hop and social inquiry can also be found in Harvard’s classrooms. Laurence A. Ralph, an assistant professor of African and African American studies and anthropology, has designed an entire course with hip-hop in mind—African American Studies 102: “The Hip-hop Generation and Post-Civil Rights Black Politics.” Its curriculum does not focus solely on hip-hop, but the art form is deployed as a tool to examine how the younger generation responds to the expectations of the older generation.
Though it is categorized as popular entertainment, hip-hop’s popularity makes it an effective medium for approaching such pressing issues as intergenerational conflict, homophobia, and politics. These modes of inquiry assume that hip-hop takes the pulse of the society it entertains. Afterall, if hip-hop’s widespread success reflects its ability to resonate with audiences, then there is truth to this notion.
“RINGTONE RAPPER”
 
Deconstruct a novel in class, and it might lose its meaning. Analyze a piece of music and it might lose its power.
It is a common refrain when it comes to studying art—by academicizing it, one risks diminishing its impact. Hip-hop is no exception.
“I think part of the challenge that I’ve found that [hip-hop scholars] have in talking about hip-hop is critiquing something they love,” Mcginty says. “They don’t want to tear down hip-hop and make it seem like something negative, but they still have to address the negatives within the genre.”
Most researchers involved in hip-hop scholarship listened to hip-hop long before they began to look at it from an academic perspective. Luckily, they say academic treatment does not necessitate a waning of their love for the form.
“I say, hey, Soulja Boy is my favorite ringtone rapper,” says Joycelyn A. Wilson, one of the fellows at the Hiphop Archive. “I’m not trying to learn anything from it, but I do like to hear it when my phone rings. You know, sometimes I don’t wanna be preached to. Sometimes I just wanna go to the party.”
For Ralph’s students—who often consider themselves part of a hip-hop generation—treating hip-hop as an academic subject is eye-opening. “When we talk about hip-hop, everybody’s implicated in it,” Ralph says. “They’ve all consumed hip-hop. They’ve all listened to it. They’ve all loved hip-hop. So when they’re reading these things, they have to grapple with how they listen to hip-hop, why they’re excited about hip-hop. So it’s a different kind of relationship, I think.”
For these researchers and students alike, hip-hop was a passion before it was a specimen. Though intense study risks alienation to music, it also adds unexpected and valuable dimensions to the art form and may even foster greater appreciation.
LOUDER THAN WORDS
The motives behind hip-hop study extend beyond the listening habits of the scholars. The intersections of hip-hop and other fields, including history, can yield critical insights, both personal and political.
Jaqueline Santos, a fellow at the Hiphop Archive, fiddles nervously with the items on her desk as she talks; she has been in the United States only since January, born and raised in Brazil.
She speaks with a careful cadence as she gives an overview of her research. “I study the cultural exchange between black youth in São Paulo and New York, between the late 1970s and the late 1980s,” Santos says. “And the circulation of images and symbols between hip-hoppers in São Paulo and New York was important for a consolidated black movement in Brazil.”
According to Santos, the 20th century black community in Brazil struggled under the weight of discrimination. This Afro-Brazilian community was also a big consumer of African-American styles of music. They could not understand exactly what African-Americans were saying due to the language barrier, but because of the civil rights imagery on the covers of vinyl records, they understood what these musicians were talking about.
As Santos delves into her work, the tremor in her voice begins to fade, the delay between her words shortens, and a passionate glint appears in her eyes. She tells me how hip-hop is one of the biggest venues for youth activism around the world. Santos flips through her dissertation, showing me pictures of hip-hop figures in São Paulo engaging with various political figures and institutions; in one picture, former Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva poses with several teenagers wearing hip hop attire.
Her passion is why she is here at the Hiphop Archive, researching the importance of a movement she loves. “I research—I don’t sing anymore,” Santos says. “But hip-hop gave other things for our lives. You don’t need to be an MC, a DJ, a graffitier, a b-boy. We can be lawyers, we can be anthropologists, we can be doctors. Hip-hop gave us the instruments to construct new perspectives for our lives.”
Santos’ connection to her work illustrates the possibilities of hip-hop. It can give voice to an entire class, an entire generation, not just in its birthplace in the United States but all over the world. It is overwhelmingly a tool of empowerment through expression. And studying hip-hop, bringing it into an academic setting, gives it the legitimacy it thus deserves.
NO ECHO CHAMBER
But all this research into hip-hop would not mean much if it were just noise in an echo chamber. Hip-hop research has practical applications.
Wilson, the other Hiphop Archive Fellow, focuses on the intersection of schooling and the millenium hip-hop generation. “Schooling” consists of all that is taught in a classroom, as opposed to education, which encompasses every learning environment—the family, the church, the classroom, and the street. Wilson emphasizes the importance and prevalence of the concept of “schooling” in hip-hop.
“Hip-hop is obsessed with school,” Wilson says. “Obsessed metaphorically, obsessed in how it categorizes generations—so now you’ve got old schools and new schools of hip-hop.”
When she first began her research, she sought to explore what hip-hop lyrics said about the benefits of formal schooling. Her results were less than glowing. “We still have to find out how to make their formal schooling a little more relevant to what [minority youth’s] issues are,” says Wilson.
Wilson believes that hip-hop can reach young people of ethnic minorities in a uniquely powerful way, so she is developing a program of leadership education—she calls it “hip-hop leadership pedagogy”—that uses hip-hop and its artists to teach kids how to be leaders. In one lesson, for instance, she discussed with KiD CuDi what it means to be a black man in America in front of a young audience at Morehouse College, Martin Luther King Jr.’s alma mater. She filmed the exchange and calls it her “KiD CuDi lesson.”
Her approach has not been met with universal enthusiasm. “Some of the misconceptions that people settle on when you’re thinking about hip-hop in any kind of environment in formal schooling is [that] all hip-hop talks about is violence and misogyny,” Wilson says. “That’s one of the challenges that I’ve had to deal with in bringing hip-hop into this...very intellectual space.”
But Wilson insists on hip-hop’s value and potency. “Hip-hop is an intellectual exercise,” she says. “These are stories. These are people’s narratives. Even the most violent song—you can take that and turn it into a teachable moment.”
THE SOURCE
Hip-hop is a mouthpiece for minorities and the oppressed, but hip-hop’s most surprising aspect is that it is a self-aware, self-critical system—much like academia itself—which is capable of critique within its own borders.
Morgan, the director of the Archive, explains this capacity for introspection. Hip-hop has five fundamental elements. “We have DJing, turntableism; the b-boy/b-girl dance aspect; the graffiti and the art that comes out of hip-hop; and then the emcee, the lyricism, the writing, and all of the lyrics,” she says. And then there’s the fifth element—knowledge. “There was this expression when hip-hop first started out—‘keeping it real,’” Morgan says. “It really was a quest for continuing to understand and critically analyze the world that they were experiencing at every conceivable level.”
The critique is one of the most important aspects of hip-hop. “If you have skills—if you come to the table with knowledge—it’s like,  ‘Let’s do it!’” Morgan says. “And if you don’t have knowledge, it’s like, ‘Why don’t you come back?’”
The very notion  of “every conceivable level” means that there’s a highest level of knowledge to be sought through hip-hop. Harvard, she explains, operates at that highest level and has the resources to give hip-hop its proper academic treatment. “Harvard has this commitment, and when you come in here,” she says, gesturing out the window of her office into the main room of the archive, “You see that this is a serious commitment.”
Harvard and hip-hop actually have a long history together, according to Morgan. The Source, one of the world’s most widely read hip-hop magazines, was started by two undergraduates at Harvard in 1988. It just seems incongruous; the images of hip-hop and the images of Harvard are so far removed from each other.
She hands me an old vinyl album. Along the side, B.M.O.C. is written in gold letters—“Big Men on Campus.” The two men on the cover look much like stereotypical Harvard men: blue-eyed, blond-haired, sharp features. But they are both sporting straight-brimmed baseball caps, and one has a bat slung over his shoulders. At first it seemed funny: They were trying too hard. They were caricatures. This was a novelty item.
But then everything Morgan had been saying about hip-hop’s unflinching inclusivity, its accessibility and the value it places on critique and experimentation—it all made sense. The pursuit of knowledge unified the seemingly incongruous hip-hop and Harvard.
“Lots of people say the Hiphop Archive doesn’t belong here,” she says. “If not at Harvard, then where?”

Two years ago, the name Esperanza Spalding meant little outside of niche jazz-radio shows and music conservatories. However, ears perked up following her Grammy win last year for Best New Artist. Immediately afterward, her album “Chamber Music Society” shot up to number 34 on the Billboard 200. Given her recent rise in popularity, now would seem as good a time as ever for Spalding to try to attract a broader audience. Her latest album, “Radio Music Society,” will be an introduction to Spalding’s career for many, but unfortunately it marks a low point in her overall work. In its diverse instrumentation, varying messages, and smorgasbord of different genres, “Radio Music Society” tries to appeal to a large influx of listeners hot on the tail of the next big thing. Although the album displays Spalding’s strong musicianship and composition, it lacks cohesiveness and emotional depth, and this Jill of all stylistic trades masters none.
Diverse instrumentation plays a crucial role in ”Radio Music Society,” if only to help distinguish between her takes on the many genres on the album. This is by far the largest departure from her established string-centric sound, and Spalding shows her impressive arranging prowess as she wields a wide array of sounds towards her mission of turning jazz once more into popular radio music. Spalding’s walking-bass lines are switched at times for a funky electric or rock grooves, as in the opening track, “Radio Song.” In various places on the album, her light, bouncing voice swoons sultrily in jazz club ballads. “Black Gold” buttresses all-female background vocals with a full choir, and synthesized riffs make regular appearances to add a little funk to the standard horn-and-brass jazz outfit. On “Let Her,” Spalding possesses a vocal delivery reminiscent of old-school hip-hop storytelling: “You just walked in to the quiet after the storm/ It’s chillingly silent/ And you sense that something’s wrong.”
Spalding branches out not only musically but also in subject matter, but in this case with mixed results. While Spalding powerfully addresses national themes of the African-American experience in “Land of the Free” and “Black Gold,” sappy love ballads like “Cinnamon Tree” and “Let Her” feel shallow and forced. The album is too grandiose in attempting to appeal to so many different sentiments. Spalding spends too little time with each lyrical concept, and as a result, the album seems to lack true heartfelt emotion.
The final two tracks capture in a nutshell the album’s inability to easily flow through each style and genre. While “City of Roses,” with its soft, slow tempo, seems to be the perfect album ending, “Smile Like That” follows in the complete opposite style. It is a mid-tempo, meandering jam session in which only the guitarist really seems to get his full worth. Eventually, the lively, heavy rock-guitar solo and fat synth pads fade out and a ponderous silence remains, and with it comes a feeling of waiting rather than completion.
”Radio Music Society” displays Spalding’s spirit as a trailblazer and multi-talented musician, but due to a lack of profound emotion, the album mostly threatens to underrepresent her talent. ”Radio Music Society” may make jazz more accessible—even with the inclusion of solos—but at what cost? Perhaps this is merely a good career move or a transition step to the greater wealth Spalding can show in the future. Spalding is at her strongest when she hones in on one style and develops her emotional themes fully, as seen on her eponymous second album.
The hipsters have a point: there’s something to be said about the dangers of casting one’s net too wide and going “mainstream.” “Radio Music Society” is the tapas bar experience of Spalding’s oeuvre: she provides small, exquisite tastes of a large selection of genres without providing a satisfying full meal. Although “Radio” will surely appeal to many, especially those with soul and jazz backgrounds, it may not be strong enough to cause the wide public to stick around to hear her next explorations.

There was nothing outlandish or extravagant on the set when Ladysmith Black Mambazo came to Sanders Theatre on Saturday. The stage was not adorned with showy lights or a full supporting dance crew. As the eight man a capella group started singing, it was apparent that their collective voice was the only instrument needed to light up the stage.
Founded in the early 1960s by current front man Joseph Shabalala, Ladysmith Black Mambazo combines traditional the South African vocal style of “isicathamiya”—a genre developed by black mine workers singing as they worked brutal conditions—with Christian gospel music. Since its early days the group has developed into a cultural icon. It collaborated with Paul Simon on his album “Graceland” in 1986 and won its first Grammy­ for the album “Shaka Zulu” ­­in 1988. The members were even hailed by Nelson Mandela as “cultural ambassadors” of South Africa after the end of apartheid. They have gone on to recieve worldwide acclaim, winning 2 more Grammys and performing at prestigious events including the Nobel Peace Prize Ceremony. While their concert at Sanders Theatre meandered at the beginning and was repetitive at times, the group’s infectious gusto and enthusiasm turned the show into a raucous and entertaining delight.
The concert featured material from Ladysmith Black Mambazo’s latest album “Songs from a Zulu Farm,” which depicts the lives of South African farmers through the group’s distinctive blend of South African musical styles. Audience members glimpsed the myriad aspects of farm life in South Africa from songs based on traditional folk tales. One such song is “Wemfana.” The monotonous repetition of the music reflected the weariness of a donkey, but the underlying upbeat rhythm also encapsulated the mood of farmers angrily chastising the naughty beast that is known to bite the bottoms of old men. Though most of the numbers were sung in Zulu, the music transcended language to speak to the audience through the group’s powerful vocals and beautiful harmonies. The singers performed “Wemfana” in a tounge-in-cheek manner and accompanied by dances imitating donkeys conveyed the mischievous nature of the animal. The group also adventurously took on the traditional English nursery rhyme “Old MacDonald” and gave it a unique Ladysmith Black Mambazo flavor through a combination of quintessential Zulu beats and traditional gospel rhythms.
The success of the group’s performance lay not just in the singing, but in the way the music seemed to be an integral part of the performers so that even their coordinated dance moves took on the appearance of instinctive movements to the rhythm instead of rigidly rehearsed steps. Each performer also brought his unique style to the dances. Some kicked their legs high above their heads in a way that mimicked the animals they were singing about, such as the narcissistic bird who serves as the central character in “Uthekwane.” The obvious rapport among the group members allowed the audience to feel comfortably at home while watching this clearly tight-knit family. (Shabalala’s four sons are current group members.) The energy of their songs allowed the audience to feel the lyrics and the music pulsing through their blood.
Ladysmith Black Mambazo aims to spread South African culture through its music. This refreshing a capella group  charms with its uplifting music and is a delight to watch.

“Ivory Tower” is back, and as usual, almost nothing has gone unchanged. The student-produced TV show recently released the first episode of season nine, which proved a promising start. The show is not new to reinvention—it overhauls its plot and characters with each passing season—and the changes have always raised the show’s standards of quality. Though it may be too soon to tell, season nine is already showing definite signs of comic maturity.
Started in 1993 under the Harvard-Radcliffe Television network (now Harvard Undergraduate TV), “Ivory Tower” is known for being the longest-running college soap opera, and it originally ran for five years before its budget and audience patience waned. The popular show about Harvard life was once featured in NBC’s “Real Life.” In 2003, it was revamped and relaunched as a web series in response to the new popularity of YouTube. It is to the show’s credit that it has repeatedly updated its style to meet the changing demands of its viewers—now well over the 1,000 mark. In fact, one could say that its common theme is loyalty to change—both in student taste and generation of Harvard students. With each season’s cast of fresh faces, old actors return as writers, directors, or producers to make room for new storylines. In season six, the show tracked the lives of Harvard freshmen experiencing their first awkward college moments. The next year, it transitioned from a reality TV format to teen drama reminiscent of “The O.C.” Season eight, a suspense serial, embroiled students in a scandal involving illegal drugs and a Wall Street executive.
In keeping with the show’s timely parallels to popular series, season nine bears welcome similarities to “The Office” in its small-budget aesthetic and deadpan humor. The whole drama is centered on the Tower Café, a fictitious coffee shop in the quad that makes smart use of the SOCH building. The café is student-managed by a colorful group of misfits who are naturally comedic, both individually and together. Bryan, the academic delinquent, shows up at the café with a droll demeanor to serve 150 hours of probation. At first, his too-cool-for-school attitude is piqued by Adam, the overly smiley manager, and his motley crew of nincompoops: Josh, the bumbling idiot; Alice the cynical smart aleck; Brenna, the ditzy beauty; and Ruth, the quirky British “sandwichista.” But after a turbulent first day at work—including a foiled team meeting, a coupon day gone wrong, and a near amputation—Bryan comes to like his clownish coworkers. It is easy to see why: the character dynamics are exaggerative yet believable thanks to the excellent comedic timing put into the exchanges.
The show has maximized its ratings by minimizing its scale. The enclosed, single setting of the first episode forces attention onto the dialogue and the character development, which have both gained in subtle irony and professional delivery this season. Although the characters are familiar types, the humor is hardly stale or corny despite the sometimes predictable plot line. The actors this year seem more comfortable and fluent with the script than in seasons past, though this is their first time acting on the show.
The best explanation for the starting success of this new season is its embrace of the emerging style of “mockumentary” sitcom. Neither straight-up reality TV nor serial drama, it is a hybrid genre that has been gaining traction for years. Moreover, thanks to its cheap production potential and its middlebrow humor, the mockumentary seems better suited for student replication than the show’s past inspirations.
Admittedly, season nine might seem fresher and funnier simply because shows like “The Office” have trained viewers to appreciate dry sarcasm. But if so, “Ivory Tower” chose well to capitalize on this trend. Its versatile re-branding and recasting have paid off through shrewd intuition. Of course, by its decade anniversary next year, “Ivory Tower” will likely receive yet another facelift, swiftly rendering the success of this season passé.

It’s a full house in Boston’s Symphony Hall. In a balcony seat sits a red mage from the Final Fantasy video game series, decked out with scarlet robes, a feathered hat, and long, flowing white hair. A husband and wife, wearing formal attire for their visit to this renowned concert hall, sit unperturbed in front of the mage. Much of the audience is casually dressed, but other costumed characters dot the concert hall, some receiving compliments on their elaborate garb.
At 8 p.m., the more than 100 musicians of the New England-based Video Game Orchestra walk onstage and are met with an eruption of applause. VGO has played music from classic games as well as more recent ones, and on March 10 the group performed the music of “Distant Worlds: Music From Final Fantasy,” a travelling multimedia production that features works of acclaimed Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu. In “Distant Worlds” shows, different orchestras and choirs play pieces from the Final Fantasy series as stills and video from the games are projected on huge screens in the venue. 
Shota Nakama, the creator and director of VGO, and his ensemble have played in front of large crowds before. Since 2008, when the Berklee College of Music graduate founded VGO, he and his musicians have played at events such as Anime Boston and the PAX video gaming conventions. Video game music has evolved from eight-bit tunes to what Nakama considers works of serious musicianship, and he and VGO seek greater recognition for the video game music genre. 
VGO distinguishes itself from many other orchestras not only with its focus on video game music, but also with its five-person rock band. VGO’s rock band, choir, and chamber orchestra create what Nakama calls a signature “rockestral” style. 
At a rehearsal the evening before the Distant Worlds concert, Nakama recalls how he has loved symphonic rock ever since he was a child. As a teenager learning to play the guitar, he admired rock bands such as Deep Purple, Helloween, and Gamma Ray. He sees the rock infusions in VGO’s pieces as an unconventional twist on classical music. “It’s kind of in my blood at this point, and I always like to do something that people don’t do,” he says.
In their rehearsal space on Boylston Street, VGO runs through the concert’s program. The rehearsal’s tone is professional, but the atmosphere is casual. One violinist wears his Boston Red Sox hat for the duration of the entire rehearsal. During a break, musicians text on their phones or laugh with friends, some of whom have played together with VGO since 2008.
When Nakama is looking for new musicians to bring to VGO, musicianship and professionalism are among his top criteria, he says. Of course, he adds, a passion for video games is always a plus, and so his musicians tend to be younger. “They have a passion, and they’re musically amazing, too,” he says. “They understand what game music is about.” Nakama, who grew up playing video games, sees pieces written for games as accompaniments to the games’ action, but also as compelling compositions in their own right. “Video game music is as good as film scores or like any other classical symphonic pieces,” he says.
VGO’s experience in the last three-and-a-half years made it an ideal candidate orchestra to play the “Distant Worlds” show. Since 2007, “Distant Worlds” and its Grammy-winning conductor, Arnie Roth, have toured across four different continents and played with some of the world’s most celebrated orchestras, including the San Francisco Symphony, the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra, and the Sydney Symphony.
Recognizing that he has worked with some of the best orchestras in the world, Roth nevertheless notices that not all of these orchestras manage to adequately rehearse the “Distant Worlds” music prior to his arrival. When asked about VGO, however, Roth jumps at the opportunity to share his positive impressions of the group.
“I could tell by my first rehearsal [that] everyone here cares and took the time to rehearse the passage work,” Roth says. “I’ve had one rehearsal with them now, and I was very surprised and glad at the proficiency of the orchestra. They’re really quite good.”
Roth and VGO began the concert with Final Fantasy’s “Prelude” on harp and proceeded through a sampling of pieces from the game series. Just before the concert’s intermission, Roth took a moment to remind the audience that 2012 marks Final Fantasy’s 25th anniversary. As musicians play concert productions like “Distant Worlds” and “The Legend of Zelda: Symphony of the Goddesses,” which began its North American tour in January, VGO members believe the video game music genre could soon enjoy more popularity.
“It’s very possible that this could be something that gets bigger very quickly, especially because the market for video games is expanding so much,” Matthew Y. Ebisuzaki, a VGO trumpeter, says. “You could also think of this as like a new type of Pops concert.”

The shelves at the Office for the Arts Ceramics Program’s studio hold many works in progress—ceramics of all shapes, sizes, and purposes, some beautifully smooth and finished, plenty waiting to be glazed and fired. But last week, the studio was nearing completion on its most significant recent project, one that does not fit on a shelf: a new kiln.
It is Monday, March 12, and for the last three days I have participated in a kiln-building master class organized by the Ceramics Program. Led by two professional kiln builders and potters from Minnesota, the sage and cheery Donovan K. Palmquist and his genial assistant Judah J. Birkeland, we’ve learned the process of kiln construction and laid layer after layer of bricks. Palmquist particularly enjoys building kilns in a workshop context. “I like to see people learning, getting enthusiastic, and getting involved,” he says.
The other workshop participants, all ceramics afficionados, come from all over the world and from a variety of backgrounds. Shamai “Sam” Gibsh came all the way from Tel Aviv, Israel; Darcie Flanigan used to work in ceramic archeology; and Klaudia M. Levin was once a dental technician. “[The class] was an interesting exposure to a whole different craft that changed the way I think about my own craft,” ceramics artist Alex T. Brizicky says. Brizicky received this year’s Mima Weissmann scholarship, which pays for young artists to spend a year studying with the Ceramics Program. “There’s this whole part of the ceramics world that I never thought about,” she says of kiln construction.
This kiln, called a soda kiln because of the sodium carbonate solution sprayed into the kiln during firing to create a unique texture on the clay, is approaching completion when I arrive on Monday. Birkeland puts the final touches on the kiln walls while Flanigan sponges excess adhesive mud off the bricks in the chimney. Today we will build the arched roof of the kiln, but the kiln is not quite ready. I go outside with Flanigan and Brizicky to spray-paint fuel pipes to keep them from corroding. Though we must wear gas masks to protect ourselves from the fumes, it is a lovely day to be outside. 
After we finish the pipes, the class gathers for lunch. Palmquist describes the ceramics community as “a pretty gregarious, fun group of people—like a big family.” I feel that camaraderie at today’s lunch. We have gone out to eat the past two days, but today we stay in for an impromptu potluck with some women who work in the studio. Though I have nothing to contribute, everyone shares the salad, hummus, pumpkin bread, pizza, pad thai, peanuts, and cookies with friendly insistence. 
After lunch, we watch a slideshow of Palmquist’s past kilns and pottery pieces and of pottery works that he finds inspirational. In more than a decade, Palmquist has built upward of 350 kilns with his company, and he has worked with Birkeland for the past four years. They both say they love their jobs. “I like travelling around the country and seeing different art programs, meeting different people and seeing their different approaches to clay,” Birkeland says. They have produced a strikingly diverse array of kilns, which look like works of art in themselves—some big, some small; some clean and modern, others rustic with different colored bricks.
Finally, the time has come to build the arch—the roof of the kiln and a major component of its structure. With an audience of others from the studio who wish to see the climactic moment, we head into the kiln room. Palmquist sets up a wooden structure we built two days before to support the arch during its construction. He jokes that we’d forgotten to account for the curvature of the earth when building it. Then we take turns placing the bricks on. I am too short to reach very well, so I strain to drop the bricks into place and cannot reach the back rows at all. We make what is called a braided arch, with the bricks’ placement staggered. No cement is needed; the structure will stay together due to tension and gravity alone. Ceramics Program instructor Crystal Ribich puts in the keystone to complete the arch. Palmquist removes the wooden support, and the crowd erupts in applause. The day’s work is almost done, though Birkeland has already set about cutting metal framing for the chimney and welding it in place. 
The kiln is completed the next day—Tuesday, March 13—and used for the first time on Friday. “I’ve been involved in four or five of these master classes, and this is probably my favorite group so far,” Birkeland says. And Ribich says that due to the quality of the materials and the construction, the kiln may serve the studio for the next fifteen years. Building it was a rare experience, and if it endures as Ribich hopes, the opportunity will be as unique for the next kiln builders.

Harvard is one of the world’s most well-known colleges, an honor that was not particularly earned from any historical Crimson athletic prowess. Mentions of our campus conjure up images of austere brick buildings and students preparing for an exam (or perhaps a Goldman interview). Even the sports at which Harvard has traditionally succeeded relate more to a culture of rigor and tradition (e.g.,crew) than a display of inherent otherworldly talent. This year, however, Harvard expanded the ambit of its excellence with its qualification for the NCAA Men’s Division I Basketball Championship. By now, everyone knows the story:This Harvard team earned a March Madness bid for the first time in 66 years. Unfortunately, it could not prolong this moment in the sun, as Vanderbilt, the fifth-seed, knocked out the team in the first round.
A disappointing loss against—as every sportscaster, Tweeter, and their respective mothers was quick to point out—the “Harvard of the South” stung but does not detract from the magnitude of this season’s achievement. Defeating the SEC champions was always a tough task, despite Harvard students’ best attempts to convince themselves Vandy was overrated. The success of the Harvard basketball team was not upsetting the Commodores, but rather earning the support of a genuine fan base. For the first time in years, the Harvard community could coalesce around Crimson hoops. Such a turn of events would have been unthinkable just five years ago, and we are excited about the very positive direction that Harvard athletics are heading.
A knock against attending Harvard (and the Ivy League in general) as opposed to a comparable academic institution such as Stanford or Georgetown has always been the lack of social atmosphere surrounding sports. This perception may be on the wane. Harvard’s end-of-year games against Penn and Princeton sold out almost instantly, and even those who do not cross the Charles River within the initial hours of ticket sales are able to tune in on television. In fact, the meager space designated as a student section in the Lavietes Pavilion has become inadequate for hosting the Crimson’s new array of interested fans.As Harvard continues its ascent in the world of basketball relevance, additional student sections will be necessary.
While students may not transform into Duke-style “Lavietes Loonies” anytime soon, the rising community aspect of the sport here on campuscannot be ignored. A sense of pride existed among Harvard affiliates in a way not previously seen. The only other event in which the entire student body rallies behind the Crimson is “The Game,” which is more about partying than admiring Harvard’s pigskin dominance over hapless Yalies. Prospective Harvard basketball players can now be pointed toward demonstrated assurances against an allegedly anti-sports culture on campus, a fact that will help future recruiting.This year’s historic run can be more than partly attributed to head coach Tommy Amaker’s laudable recruiting ability. Amaker has done an incredible job coaching since taking the position in 2007. Having turned down an offer to coach the Miami Hurricanes last year, he looks set to continue to make his mark as Harvard’s basketball team continues its rise. And next year, we’ll be back.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During my first semester of college, I introduced myself as a “freshman.” But after a few months, the words “fresh” and “man” began to sound strange as they came out of my mouth. Then I realized that I am not a “fresh man” (a word that dates back to the 16th century). Instead, I am a woman who is new to Harvard and college life: a freshwoman.
Sometimes people laugh at me when I say that I am a freshwoman. Other times, I hear people adopting it in their own introductions. In either case, this word—seemingly so simple—makes people think twice about sexism in our language. In light of recent debates over women’s rights and in honor of Women’s Week, I think we could all benefit from a hard a look at the subtle pervasiveness of masculine language in our discourse that even most feminists subconsciously perpetuate.
Gendered language has long perpetuated sexism. One example is the difference between Miss, Mrs., and Mr. A woman’s status in life was originally determined by whether she was single or married—her title revealed all. The non-normative term “Ms.” first came on the scene in 1901, but it wasn’t until 1969 that is became widely used. The New York Times didn’t accept the usage of “Ms.” until 1986. Now it is a common and respectful title for all women. This two-letter word stopped defining women based on their relationship status and helped equalize the role of women in society.
Yet there are many examples of how similarly sexist language endures. A recent article from Scientific American notes “the general public just can't make up its mind about the existence of man-made climate change.” One glaringly offensive word sticks out: “man-made.” In the 21st century, after millions of women have fought to create equality for women in America, the commonly used term “man-made” blatantly does not include the female half of the species. How can modern rhetoric be filled with such sexist wording? Are editorial sensibilities simply lazy and indifferent to anachronistic language? Why are women not outraged at the continued use of language that fails to affirm their inclusion in society?
Here is another example: for the first semester of my freshwoman year at Harvard, the most read story on The Crimson was “15 Hottest Freshmen: All Summer Long.” The article featured 15 freshmen and freshwomen who were considered “hot.” Yes, both men and women were featured. But the idea that people of either gender are defined by their appearance undermines the respect for the individual that is at the very core of feminism. Judging people based on how they look is superficial and insulting, yet online viewers chose to click on this article and made it one of the most popular on the website. Despite our progressive modern age, people have an underlying tendency to revert to traditional views of women as objects to look at. Our language unfortunately supports this trend.
Feminists have won many battles: Women in America have more rights and opportunities today than they did even thirty years ago. But the strains of sexism that persist today are very subtle. Hidden in “most read” lists and the very words we use to describe ourselves, the masculine worldview still maintains a dominant presence. It seems that most people are either unaware of this or have let their moral outrage wither. One thing, however, is clear: The evolution of human rights from free speech to feminism has no room for complacency.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Prince William and Kate Middleton took their wedding vows in Westminster Abbeyon April 29, 2011, the entire world tuned in. It seems like just about everyoneis obsessed with the lingering elements of aristocracy in the United Kingdom, with news about the Royal Family generating buzz in tabloids across the globe. But most people overlook the remaining power the British aristocracy wield through the House of Lords, the upper chamber in the British government. This unelected body of roughly 800 Lords, ranging from hereditary peers to Anglican Bishops, has undue power in Westminster and often stagnates the work of the elected House of Commons. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg's suggestion to reform the House of Lords has merit and is a key policy for the Liberal Democrat Party. However, Clegg’s moves could destabilise the governing coalition and diminish the power of the House of Commons in the long term.
Ever since his impressive performance in the Prime Ministerial debates caught the eye of the British public, Nick Clegg and his Liberal Democrat Party have suffered from high expectations. Clegg has had a difficult time pushing for major Lib-Dem policies since he took up the mantle of leading the minority partner of the governing coalition. He and many Lib-Dem members of parliament were criticized by young voters, who comprise a large part of their base, for abstaining on the vote to increase student tuition fees. Voters also chose to reject electoral reform, a major priority of the party. Polls have showed that popularity of the party has dropped to 10 percent from a pre-election 20 percent. Clegg himself has received most of the blame for the failure of the LibDems to deliver on its key goals. The most telling evidence is a recent poll thatshowed Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron is currently more popular among Lib Dems than Nick Clegg is. It seems that the Lib Dem’s electoral chances have been ruined.
But an opportunity has arisen to salvage theparty’s reputation. Clegg is pushing for "Lords Reform," a plan that would reduce the house from 800 to 300 lords, 240 of which would be directly elected for single 15-year terms. Althoughthe previous Labour government abolished the vast majority of hereditary peers, the house remains an antiquated body from the Magna Carta era. The House of Lords cannot prevent bills from passing into law, but it has repeatedly delayed the government's popular welfare reform bill. Its ability to limit the work of the House of Commons contradicts Britain’s principles of liberal democracy and representative elections.
Clegg's move will undoubtedly be met by enough opposition to tear the ruling coalition apart. Although Labour officially supports an elected House of Lords, there is a significant number of old-party Conservatives as well as Labour and Lib-Dem MPs who adamantly oppose Lords reform. The Lords themselves have united against Clegg’s proposals, with a vast majority of Lords declaring the proposal unconstitutional. David Cameron will have to choose between reigning in his deputy and endangering his relationships with MPs and the Lords, either of which may weaken the coalition. Although there are many calling for Clegg to drop his proposals for the sake of maintaining the strength of the coalition, there is a chance that Cameron will make concessions on Lords reform in case the Conservatives fail to win a majority in the next election.
Clegg's proposal poses a problem that transcends political bickering. Although the Lords have severely delayed bills from the Commons in the past, ultimately the Commons wields the power to rule the country. The House of Lords acts as more of a review body, not unlike the Supreme Court of the United States. Electing Lords could give the House of Lords a degree of legitimacy which could compete with the Commons. One of the parliamentary system's greatest strengths is its ability to rule through coalitions to break deadlocks. Clegg's reform could create a serious contender to the power of the Commons, which may lead to a government of perpetual gridlocká la the United States.
Polls show that the public of the United Kingdom is ambivalent towards reforming the House of Lords. Therefore it is politicians, not the public, who will have to bear the burden of campaigning for Lords reform. It is probable that Clegg's proposal may be passed given that it has the support of most Labour and Lib-Dem MPs and younger Conservative MPs. The immediate dangers posed by his reforms do not outweigh the benefits of long-term reform for the UK. This is a country that deserves a political systemthat lives up to the principles of liberal democracy that it purports to endorse. Who knows, this may also be the perfect opportunity for the Lib Dems to use a major constitutional achievement to recoup its losses in time for the next election.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While Harvard has longprided itself on promoting academic excellence of the highest caliber, the rampant globalization of recent decades has expanded its aimsto include a focus on creating global citizens capable of engaging with people, cultures, and ideas from all over the world. Harvard uses many effective means to achieve this end, such asoffering robust foreign language courses, introducing new General Education requirements, and promoting well-established study abroad programs. In addition to these official efforts, there is alsothe oft-touted approach of filling our campus with international students from across the globe.
As an “international” student myself, however, I have often observed that the vast majority of us jumped into the melting pot long before we reached Harvard—in many ways, we got here because of it. Harvard’s justifiably selective admissions standards as an American college create cultural and economic criteria that contribute to a far greater degree of cultural homogenization than what simple demographics suggest. As such, I often question whether the international student body at Harvard contributes to the creation of global citizens truly capable of cultural and linguistic flexibility and adaptation to different contexts, or ratherto the creation of global elite citizens capable only of interacting with people who, albeitwith diverse passports, have already adapted to an “international” English-mediated culture.
There seem to betwo major factors that directly contribute tocultural homogeneity among Harvard’s international students. Namely, prospective students must have adequate preparation for the type of independent, inquiry-based learning that is encouraged in our classrooms, and they need to speak and write English at a high academic level. The first requirement presents a challenge to those students from places where education systems do not encourage this type of learning. The best way for students from these countries to apply successfully, then,is to attend some sort of international or boarding school, or otherwise enroll in more liberal academic programs that offer curricula divergent from local educational philosophies.
The second requirement is a challenge to all students from nations where English is not a native or even a common language, especiallyin countries where the native language is wholly unrelated to English (as is the case in much of Asia). This means that prospective students from these backgrounds are, in practice,forcedto take costly tutoring classes, attend Western international schools or boarding schools, or otherwise having some relation to Anglophone countries in order to learn English well in the first place. Because of this apparent yet unstated prerequisite of obtaining the type ofeducation that often costs much more money than a public, local education, the students who eventually find themselves qualified to be admitted to selective American universities inevitably come from disproportionately wealthy backgrounds.If one did some simple research on the statistics of international students admitted every year from a place like Hong Kong, where I attended an international high school, one could easily see that an overwhelming majority of successful applicants share similar privileged educational opportunities which are not at all representative of the common experience in the city.
Of course, it should be no surprise that international students are wealthier than the average in their home countries—after all, this istrue of American students at Harvard, as well. Beyond statistics, the importantpoint here is that bright students who have the financial means to overcome the two challenges stated above typically become more familiar with and inclined toward English-mediated, often American-centric culture, at times becoming somewhat removed from the cultures, languages,and ways of thinking of their own countries. As such, it is no surprise that very few international students at Harvard experience significant culture shock or find any particular difficulty in building meaningful relationships with their American or international classmates. Cultural homogenization does occur at Harvard, but much of it occurs even before one’s application is submitted.
It is hard to criticize this considering that when significant cultural and linguistic homogenization does not take place prior to arrival on campus, self-segregation is bound to occur and would severely restrict inter-student exchange, degrading the overall intellectual experience for all students involved. Acknowledging this, however, I think if we truly wish to become enlightened, adaptable, and considerate global citizens, we have to be the ones to put ourselves in situations where we have to adapt to engage in fruitful interactions with people from genuinely foreign cultural and economic backgrounds. This could be as simple as spending a semester abroad, or it could be as committed as searching for socially responsible career opportunities abroad where an expatriate lifestyle is out of the question—using Hong Kong as an example again, this could mean opting for employmentother than the investment bank,which would inevitably trap a Harvard graduate in an upper-class, culturally homogenized bubble—a tinysliver of what the city really represents. Either way, I think that developing ourselves as global citizens is much more than collecting passport stampsand making friends with international roommates—it is about not taking for granted that unfamiliar things and people will always adapt to us.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson was named the new vice president and dean of the College at Colgate University in Hamilton, N.Y. on Monday.
During her six-and-a-half years at Harvard, Nelson has led initiatives to revise the College’s alcohol policy and renew the residential House system as the head of the Office of Student Life since its creation in 2009.
Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds announced Nelson’s departure in an email to College staff on Monday, adding that a search for Nelson’s permanent replacement will commence “in the near future.”
After Nelson leaves Harvard for her new position at the end of June, current Associate Dean of Student Life Joshua G. McIntosh will serve as interim dean of student life.
McIntosh has named continuing many of Nelson’s major initiatives as priorities for his tenure as interim dean of students. These include planning for House renewal, developing the new BGLTQ program, and publicizing public service opportunities to the student body, McIntosh wrote in an email. He declined to comment on any intentions to apply for the permanent position.
In the Colgate press release, Nelson cited both professional and personal reasons for accepting the new position.
“Given Colgate’s proven reputation as an exceptional liberal arts college, with an enriching and complementary student life program, I am eager to embrace this new professional opportunity,” Nelson said.
Nelson added that her move to Colgate will “allow our family to return to the beautiful Upstate New York region, where my husband, our four children, and I have roots.” Nelson’s hometown of Oxford, N.Y. is about a 30-mile drive from Colgate.
At Harvard, top College administrators sang praises of their departing colleague.
“It has been a pleasure to work with Suzy,” Assistant Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich wrote in an email. “Colgate has made a great choice, and the students there will really benefit from her leadership. We’ll certainly miss her.”
McIntosh echoed Friedrich’s sentiments, writing that Nelson “has been an extraordinary mentor and friend. I am going to miss her tenacity, resilience, collaborative leadership style, and wonderful sense of humor.”
Nelson was chosen for the position from a pool of four finalists narrowed down by a search committee of thirteen Colgate administrators, affiliates, and  students who began their search last August, The Colgate Maroon-News reported in February.
Nelson came to Harvard as associate dean of residential life in 2005. She was appointed dean of student life in 2007.
Nelson’s work at Colgate will focus on many of the same themes of residential life, inclusion, and service that she emphasized at Harvard.
“Suzy will play a vital role in fostering a rich set of living experiences, promoting discussions across differences, developing service opportunities, and helping to ensure that Colgate students live vibrant and healthy lives,” Colgate University President Jeffrey Herbst said in a press release.
Nelson, who earned her Ph.D. in higher education administration at Syracuse University and her undergraduate degree at the State University of New York at Potsdam, has previously worked as an administrator at Syracuse, Cornell University, and Siena College—all in New York—as well as Bowling Green State University in Ohio.
Prior to that, she taught English in two New York school districts, according to the Colgate press release.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council passed a policy order at Monday’s meeting that would extend the city manager’s contract until June 30, 2013, to provide a transition period for the selection and preparation of a new city manager, a task the city has not taken on in over 30 years.
Current City Manager Robert W. Healy has served in the role since 1981, but, as he approaches his 70th birthday, has informed the Council that he plans to retire. Healy’s current contract expires in September.
“The reality is, there’s been no city manager hired in the city for 31 years, so no one on this council ever hired a city manager,” Healy said. “31 years I’ve led the city, and a 15-month period of planning for a transition was an important one.”
Cambridge uses a Plan E form of government, in which the City Council hires a city manager who is responsible for running the city.
But the extension of the contract was somewhat contentious among councillors, as Councillors Kenneth E. Reeves ’72, Craig A. Kelley, and Minka Y. vanBeuzekom voted against the policy order.
Kelley, who has never supported Healy in the position of city manager, disputed the claim that a 15-month transition was necessary.
“We transition a [U.S.] president in two and a half months,” Kelley said during the meeting. “That we need 15 months for the manager of Cambridge just seems unreasonable to me.”
Apart from concerns over the length of the transition period, Reeves said that he did not approve of some of Healy’s recent decisions. In particular, Reeves objected to Healy’s handling of a discrimination suit brought against the city.
“We just wasted millions of dollars pursuing a legal matter that we should have been out of no sooner than we got in,” Reeves said. “I think in this last term there have been some real missteps that have cost the citizens.”
Despite vocal opposition, the decision to extend the contract passed 6-3.
“The manager’s done a great job for a long time for the city, and this seemed like a good way to put a transition in motion,” Mayor Henrietta J. Davis, who supported the contract extension, said. “It also honors the work that he’s done for the city—we end up with a very strong local economy, and we’re going to give him a lot of the credit for that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 21, 2012, at 4:16 a.m.
The Cataracs and Das Racist will perform at the spring College-wide concert Yardfest on April 15, according to Cataracs General Manager Joshua Andriano and Das Racist representative Clayton Blaha.
The Cataracs, a two-man hip-hop group, are best known for their song “Top of the World.” They were featured in Dev’s “Bass Down Low” and last year’s Yardfest headliner Far East Movement’s “Like a G6.”
Das Racist, a Brooklyn based hip-hop group, emerged on the music scene in 2008 with the song “Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.” The group is know for its 2011 single “Michael Jackson.”
The College Events Board, which organizes Yardfest every year along with the Harvard College Concert Commission, is also hosting a “Battle for Yardfest” event to choose a student group to open for the celebrity performers. The winner will be chosen after the groups perform at the Student Organization Center at Hilles on March 30.
CEB Co-Chair Emily S. Rutter ’13, who is also a Crimson sports editor, said that the organization would formally announce the performers in the coming weeks after picking the student performers. It remains unclear whether this year’s Yardfest will feature a third celebrity musical group as it has done in the past two years.
Last year, Yardfest overlapped with the College’s Visitas program—the visiting weekend for high school students who have been offered admission to the College—contributing to a record high turnout at the concert. This year, Visitas will be the weekend following Yardfest.
Yardfest 2011 featured performances from The White Panda and Sam Adams alongside Far East Movement. The year prior, singer and rapper Kid Cudi performed alongside indie-folk artist Patrick Park and rapper Wale.
Spring musical festivals are highly-anticipated events for many students at Ivy League universities. The electronic artist Tiësto will headline the University of Pennsylvania’s Spring Fling this spring, with Passion Pit as the opening act. Yale’s Spring Fling will feature rapper T-Pain alongside rapper BIG RyAT.

Following a week of preparation in Maryland over spring break, the Harvard sailing teams produced mixed results amidst strong opposition and adverse weather conditions in last weekend’s regattas.
TRUXTUN UMSTED
With very little wind to aid them, the No. 12 coed team struggled to a 15th-place finish at the Truxtun Umsted Intersectional, a two-day regatta hosted annually by the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md.
Among the most competitive collegiate sailing contests of the year, 17 of the 20 teams competing in the regatta were ranked in the top 25 nationally. The event includes two divisions of singlehanded boats in addition to the usual two divisions of doublehanded boats, creating a unique test for the teams.
“This was probably the most challenging fleet we’re going to face until qualifiers later this spring,” sophomore crew Sarah Pierson said.
Senior Brendan Kopp and Pierson paced the Crimson, placing 10th in the A division with 62 points. But Harvard did not fare as well in the singlehanded C and D divisions, in which sophomore Luke O’Connor and junior Jason Michas placed 15th and 17th, respectively.
Despite pleasant temperatures in the high 60s, the unfavorable wind conditions caused numerous stops and starts in the action on both Saturday and Sunday. Races were cancelled for all of Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning as teams waited for the wind to pick up and allow competition to resume. In total, each division completed only six races over the course of the weekend.
“If we had had more races and a full regatta, we would have done much better than we did,” Pierson said. “The way sailing works is you have some great races and some bad races, and we ended up not finishing as well as we would have liked.”
Yale won the truncated event handily with a score of 127, giving the Bulldogs a 28-point victory over second-place Tufts.
Despite the disappointing finish, Pierson felt good about the team’s prospects heading into future regattas.
“We can pray for better weather,” Pierson said. “The mechanics are there; our boat handling is great. I think we’re poised to do very well. A lot of [upcoming regattas] are on our home territory, the Charles. We just need to do a little work coming off the starting line and handling other boats, especially in the first critical seconds of the race.”
ST. MARY’S WOMEN’S
The women’s sailing team submitted a strong performance on Saturday, taking fourth place at the St. Mary’s Women’s Intersectional in St. Mary’s, Md. The Crimson registered 122 points, trailing second-place Yale by only five, and boasted the day’s second-best individual A boat, as senior skipper Emily Lambert and senior crew Alexandra Jumper led the Harvard A boat to 50 points.
Tricky winds delayed the start of the event and kept teams off balance for most of the day, but conditions were otherwise favorable, with temperatures cresting over 70 degrees. As with the coed event, the unpredictable winds caused the teams to conduct a limited number of races.
“There were definitely very challenging conditions,” Jumper said. “Very light, very shifty breeze, coming from a wide variety of directions. It was about staying on our toes, being aware of what’s going on, and trying to make the best of it.”
The B boat, skippered by sophomore Morgan Russom and crewed by classmate Isabel Ruane, finished with 72 points, good for sixth in the B division.
Lambert and Jumper’s performance steadied the inexperienced Crimson women’s team, of which they are two of only three upperclassmen. Heading into their final spring season, the pair hopes to establish a legacy for their younger teammates, like Russom and Ruane, to follow.
“It’s exciting to see [the younger sailors] grow and improve,” Jumper said. “We try to set an example and work as hard as we can in practice to impart whatever experience we have.”
The Crimson, unranked entering the event, finished ahead of nine nationally-ranked teams, including No. 2 College of Charleston, No. 3 Rhode Island, and No. 5 Dartmouth. Georgetown, tied with Rhode Island for third in the country, dominated the event with 71 points, 46 ahead of Yale.
“It was a hard weekend for any of the teams, even teams with a lot of practice,” Jumper said. “Regardless of skill level, it was an unpredictable breeze. You just have to anticipate what’s going to happen and take advantage of the breeze on the course that was there.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: March 21
An earlier version of this article said that Brendan Kopp is the captain of the coed sailing team. He is in fact no longer the captain.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Let me start off by saying that flights from Boston to Albuquerque are not cheap, which forced me (and the Crimson Sports board, with which I tagged along) to travel to Denver, where we rented an SUV to make the picturesque drive to Albuquerque, N.M. Thank you, NCAA committee, for that one, really.
Despite the remote location, I made the trip because I figured that, as a senior, it would be my last—and first—chance to go to the NCAA tournament as a student and root for my school.
Before earning its tournament berth this year, Harvard (26-5, 12-2 Ivy) had not made it to the Big Dance since 1946, when the NCAA tournament invited only eight teams. Not only was this moment historic, but it was also a testament to how far the basketball program has come under Crimson coach Tommy Amaker.
By now we all know what happened against Vanderbilt (25-11, 10-6 SEC), and how Harvard got ousted from the tournament. With Wisconsin knocking the Commodores out in the next round, the matchup between Vanderbilt and the Crimson didn’t turn out to mean much in the grand scheme of things.
Despite the loss, it was a big step in the team’s development, but I’m going to be honest: this would be a much angrier column had it not been for the final half of the second period. With Harvard down by 10 at the break, I kept telling my friends and myself that our team could still make a comeback; that it wasn’t over. But the second half started badly and after a couple of years of strong performances in the NCAA tournament from the Ancient Eight, this was pretty disappointing. Then sophomore Laurent Rivard caught fire.
The Canadian had the hot hand in the second half to keep Harvard alive, finishing the game six of seven from beyond the arc. He made me believe that it was still possible to overcome what had once been an 18-point deficit. And the Crimson came close to accomplishing the feat; it was a two-possession game late, before a few unfortunate bounces put the game out of reach.
We put up a fight—one that had my heart beating intensely as the clock wound down—but I just wish that the team had played at that level all game. This was most certainly a matchup we could have won with fewer silly turnovers and sloppy play.
But it’s easy to criticize in hindsight, and that’s not my intention. I’m just recounting the mixed emotions I felt while watching the game in person, and despite all the “what ifs,” I felt proud to be sporting my Harvard apparel at the end of it all.
What also made me proud was being in the class 2012 with the seniors on the team. You guys impacted the program in a big way and accomplished things that 66 years worth of players tried to do. Congratulations on your success, and thank you for everything.
Despite the loss, the experience validated breaking the bank for the trip. UNM’s “The Pit” hosted fans from all over the country, creating an exciting environment that never quieted down, no matter who was on the court. It was like a home game for all teams involved. There were also a lot of Albuquerque residents, many crowding around the flat screens stationed around the arena to follow what was going on with their beloved Lobos. When UNM finally edged out Long Beach State during the Harvard game, the crowd erupted into huge cheers for the hometown team. I genuinely celebrated for Los Lobos—Albuquerque had been really kind to us, so it felt right.
After the game, I went with my friend’s family to the Harvard reception at a nearby hotel, where Amaker and his team arrived to a standing ovation from the room full of alumni. Athletic Director Bob Scalise honored Amaker in the center of the room, and Amaker did the same for the seniors on the team and proceeded to thank the band and cheerleaders for their efforts. Donald B. Swegan—a member of that 1946 team—was given witty customized T-shirts as gifts, and former players from the 1950’s received some as well. It was an emotional ceremony and very well deserved.
That gathering marked the end of Harvard’s run in the NCAA tournament. Bittersweet, yes, but a big step forward for a much maligned program. As Amaker implied during the small ceremony, we’ll hopefully be dancing again next year, and if the NCAA is a little kinder to Harvard and places it somewhere near home, I’ll definitely be there jumping up and down too. After this experience, I would encourage everyone to do the same.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sitting in an 8-6 fourth quarter hole in its Ivy League opener against Brown on Saturday night, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team looked at risk of dropping its fourth straight game and putting its preseason aspirations in jeopardy.
That is, until a familiar face took control.
Senior attackman Jeff Cohen reeled off three consecutive goals to give the Crimson its first lead of the game with just under eight minutes to play. After Brown forced sudden-death overtime with a late game-tying goal, Cohen responded with his fifth and most thrilling goal of the game, then proceeded to Tebow—an internet phenomenom ignited by pious NFL quarterback Tim Tebow who routinely drops to one knee and bows his head at the end of every game—as his teammates rushed the field.
“That goal was definitely [the result of] six guys playing together and our entire offense playing well,” Cohen said. “It was a great feed from Kevin and then I did the easiest part,”
The senior netted a goal late in the first quarter but was shut out until the fourth, when his three goals in five minutes swung the game’s momentum. Co-captain Kevin Vaughan fed Cohen in front of the net and he finished from close range to pull Harvard within one.Then, minutes later, he attacked the right side of the crease, spun away from a defender and shot as he fell to tie the game at eight. The go-ahead goal came on a contested mid-range shot which sailed under the stick of Brown’s goalkeeper.
In overtime, Cohen received a pass from Vaughan on the right side of the net with just enough daylight to get a shot off. He didn’t disappoint, as the ball sailed into the back of the net to seal the win for Harvard.
It was the second consecutive five-goal performance for Cohen, who also led the Crimson in an 11-8 loss to No. 10/11 Duke last week. Harvard was doomed by a seven-goal third quarter from Duke in the game. Cohen netted two early goals to help the Crimson go into halftime level, but his three fourth quarter scores weren’t enough to mount a late comeback.
Cohen’s 23 goals this season tie him as the nation’s second leading scorer with Michael Antinozzi of Binghamton at 3.88 goals per game; only Colgate’s Peter Baum has been more prolific with 4.13 goals per contest.
“I think this year he’s really focused in on doing everything he can to help the team succeed,” Harvard head coach Chris Wocjik ’96 said. “He’s been very accurate shooting and very effective with his overall game”
Cohen, who currently has 117 career goals, is Harvard’s fourth all-time leading scorer, an unsurprising fact considering he has led the Crimson in scoring in each of his first three seasons and will likely do the same this year. At his current pace, he will post one of the top five scoring seasons in Harvard history, potentially improving on the 9th-place rank of his sophomore season and the 12th-place rank of his junior year.
“His entire career he’s been an outstanding goal-scorer,” Wocjik said.
Not only has Cohen been a consistent scorer from year to year, he’s only been held under three goals once through six games this season, an 11-4 thumping of Vermont in the season opener. Since then he has tallied two hat-tricks and three five-goal performances, as opposing defenses have struggled to slow him down despite his status as an offensive focal point for the Crimson.
“I think our offense has put him in good positions, freeing him up for good looks,” Wocjik said. “We want to play to our strengths, and on our offense, in terms of finishing, he’s the guy we look to.”

Sorry folks, Spring Break is over. Luckily, the Arts Board is here to help. Successful execution of an all-nighter requires mastery of the myriad emotional states that stress and exhaustion produce—grief, anger, narcissism, joy, transcendence. After careful research, Arts has found that the best tools for dealing with stress are copious volumes of coffee and music from the German classical repertoire. Enjoy.

You're on a roll, and you feel invincible—amplify the heroic mood with what might be the most self-aggrandizing piece of music ever written. Throw humility to the wind and enjoy the power trip.
Hour 4: 1 - 2 a.m.
Beethoven, Sonata No. 26 in E-Flat, Op. 81a "Les Adieux," 3.
Suddenly, you remember you're exhausted. Down a coffee and force yourself to surge ahead—go with a Beethoven finale for ecstatic oomph.
Hour 5: 2 - 3 a.m.
Brahms, "Ein Deutsches Requiem" – 1. "Selig sind, die da Leid tragen"
You've come to a place of quasi-religious tranquility—so tired yet lucidly awake. Your suffering has transcended the body, but your saving grace is the promise of sleep in just four hours. The heavenly Brahms chorus confirms that the joy of eternal rest is within reach.
Hours 6 & 7: 3 – 5 a.m.
Schoenberg, String Quartet No. 2 - 4.
Tranquility has long given way to existential despair, but with the sleep deprivation you're also feeling so loopy that you're not sure if it is your mind or Arnold Schoenberg that has placed a seemingly random soprano into the midst of an atonal string quartet. As you cope with hallucinations, the sun starts to peek through the windows of the library, reminding you that tomorrow is actually a real thing.
Hour 8:  5 - 6 a.m.
Wagner, Siegfried Act 3 Scene 3 – "Heil dir, Sonne"
The sun is up, it's tomorrow, and you're finally done. There is a kind of perverse joy that comes with what you've just accomplished, and as you pack up, you might as well revel in the glory of your acheivement as Birgit Nilsson's Brünnhilde hails the sun and radiant day with all her Teutonic might. Now, it's time to go sleep forever.

Stop by Lamont Library Café before 10 p.m. tonight for a free cup of coffee or tea courtesy of Harvard College Faith and Action's "campus kindness team." Karl E. Krahbiel '15, one of the organizers of the giveaway, described the free drinks as a "quasi-random act of kindness." Just look for a friendly person handing out paper cups, which can be used as vouchers for café beverages.
