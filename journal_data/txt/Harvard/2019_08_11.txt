After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
DOHA, QATAR — The porters exchange bemused grins and wish me a pleasant evening stroll. The first time, I worried it was my outfit: a skin-tight t-shirt and skimpy polyester shorts that are definitely too short to be culturally appropriate. After dodging threads of pungent shisha and sidestepping six lanes of traffic, I stretch my calves on the shore of the Persian Gulf.
I schedule my runs for just after sunset, when the temperature has fallen at least below 100 degrees Fahrenheit — maybe down to 95 on a particularly cool day. It’s so hot that even most locals flee the Middle East to escape the summer sun. So my zealous rejection of air-conditioned gyms and state-of-the-art fitness equipment tends to raise some eyebrows.
Jumping over a few bushes (and nearly stepping on some stray cats), I arrive at the Corniche. This seven-kilometer promenade bustles with life after dark: pick-up matches of ping pong, toddlers on tricycles, and young men peddling salty snacks. Couples sit to chat on concrete steps, and a few kids take a dip in the turquoise seawater. Many smoke, a few cast lines for harmour or lukhma, and most sip cups of steaming karak — the ubiquitous local chai masala analog, spiced heavily with cardamom. I still don’t understand the custom of drinking hot beverages, but these folks are the world experts in surviving extreme heat; I trust their judgment.
There’s sort of a cooling effect, paradoxically, that comes with picking up speed. The rush of marine air is like a whirling fan, the force of which varies directly with the firing of my quads. I lean into the last 100 meters and pause to sip cold water with the towering maroon-and-white figure who welcomes me with a torch. Orry the Oryx, mascot for the 2006 Asian Games, directs a pensive gaze toward the desert from his pedestal on the Corniche.
Qatar didn’t send a contingent to the first Asian Games in 1951. In fact, Doha was then the size of my rural Wisconsin hometown, aching from the demise of the pearling industry. But almost overnight, the House of Al Thani traded docks of dhows and divers for a booming port of oil tankers and petroleum roughnecks. Up from the Arabian sand sprouted a futuristic metropolis, complete with architectural masterpieces designed by the likes of Jean Nouvel and I.M. Pei. Qatari citizens — who compose about an eighth of the population here — are now the richest people in the world, and their consumption is as conspicuous as I’ve ever seen.
It’s nearly asphyxiating; a blast of humid air rolls over the bubbling, gurgling, emulous waves. I down the dregs of my bottle, toss it in the recycling bin, and turn toward the motley skyline for a sweaty trot back to my hotel.
What keeps me coming back to the Corniche every night is — unlike at the palatial malls, carved out of Italian marble, or the lavish eateries where we take our business lunches — a coming-together of all who call Doha their home. I run past locals draped in their white thobes and black abayas; tourists en route to Europe, Africa, and East Asia; expats lured by the promise of lucrative contracts; and hard hat-clad construction workers who toil around the clock to erect skyscrapers and World Cup stadiums. Within a society marked by stark inequality, all converge for karak and conversation at the edge of the Gulf.
“The rich and the poor meet together: the Lord is the maker of them all.”
A familiar yellow sign — an invitation for milk tea — illuminates the impeccably manicured park and signals my arrival home. Tomorrow night I’ll remember to carry a few extra riyals for a hot cup, sprinkled with saffron threads, from Karak Spicy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: August 11, 2019 at 10:43 p.m.
A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit Thursday that was brought against the Harvard Law Review in October alleging the legal journal violates federal anti-discrimination laws in its member and article selection policies.
The suit — which was filed by the Texas-based anti-affirmative action group Faculty, Alumni, and Students Opposed to Racial Preferences — also implicated the University, Harvard Law School, and the United States Department of Education.
The Law Review staff selection process accepts 48 second and third-year law students each year in a three-pronged process. Twenty of the 48 students are chosen based solely on their performance in a writing competition, 10 are selected based jointly on the writing competition and HLS grades, and 18 are selected through “a holistic but anonymous review that takes into account all available information,” according to its website.
This “holistic” review includes information applicants may share regarding “their racial or ethnic identity, physical disability status, gender identity, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status.”
The FASORP suit argued that this part of the selection process violates federal laws Title VI — which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, and national origin — and Title IX, which prohibits gender-based discrimination.
The University and Law School filed a joint motion to dismiss the suit in December. The Law Review filed a separate motion to dismiss.
Both motions noted that the Law Review is independent from the University, and thus does not receive federal funding. Both motions also argued that FASORP had no standing to bring the suit because the group failed to identify a member of the organization who had been affected by the Law Review’s policies.
FASORP amended its suit in January to include a new plaintiff — fellow Texas-based organization Coalition for Meritocracy at Universities — and to claim that the plaintiffs have standing to sue because their membership includes current Law School students and affiliated faculty. The amended suit also introduced new complaints that the Law School illegally uses affirmative action policies in its faculty hiring process.
Despite the plaintiffs’ elaboration on their standing to sue, the court Thursday granted the defendants’ motions to dismiss.
Federal judge Leo T. Sorokin wrote in the court order that the plaintiffs’s assertions of standing, which did not include the names of any of its allegedly “affected” members, “falls woefully short” of the demanded level of specificity.
“Their failure to supply even the slightest description of any member who might satisfy the prerequisites for Article III standing — including concrete and particularized, actual or imminent injury redressable by a favorable decision in this case — requires dismissal of the Amended Complaint in its entirety,” Sorokin wrote.
Sorokin also wrote that the court found it “prudent” to elaborate on the suit’s “deficiencies,” and added that the plaintiffs failed to prove that the Law Review receives federal funding, offer any facts regarding the Law Review’s article selection process, or demonstrate that the editor selection process functions as an “unlawful quota.”
“Although the plaintiffs describe in detail HLRA’s membership-selection process, the facts they recount do not support an inference that the process violates federal law,” Sorokin wrote on the final point.
Sorokin added that the plaintiffs failed to substantiate its charges against the Law School for its allegedly discriminatory hiring practices.
“The Amended Complaint likewise contains no facts — let alone sufficient facts — to illuminate the conclusory assertion that HLS (“along with nearly every law school in the United States”) discriminates on the basis of gender and race when hiring faculty,” he wrote.
Sorokin also dismissed the claim against DeVos.
Lauren N. Beck, president of the Law Review, declined to comment, writing that the court’s opinion speaks for itself. The Law School did not respond to comment, and the Department of Education also did not respond to a request for comment.
The plaintiffs have 30 days to file a second amended suit, according to the court order.
