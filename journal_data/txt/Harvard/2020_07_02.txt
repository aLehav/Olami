After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard filed a motion Wednesday to dismiss a lawsuit brought by Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign over the University’s alleged investments in companies tied to the prison industry.
Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign first filed suit against the University in Massachusetts state court on Feb. 20. The suit alleges the defendants — Harvard University and University President Lawrence S. Bacow; the Harvard Corporation and its Senior Fellow William F. Lee; and the Harvard Management Company — violated Massachusetts state law on two counts.
The plaintiffs allege in their complaint that Harvard is in “violation of fiduciary duty and breach of the Harvard Charter,” by failing to “manage the endowment in ‘good faith and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise in a similar situation.’” The complaint states that “by continuing to profit off the caging of people” Harvard has violated its “legal duty.”
It also alleges Harvard has conducted “untrue and misleading advertising” in regard to the school addressing its ties to slavery.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on the motion.
The University’s motion to dismiss states that the plaintiffs in the lawsuit have “failed to allege any wrongful conduct.”
“Even if Plaintiffs had standing—which they do not—their Complaint must be dismissed for the independent reason that they have failed to allege that Harvard engaged in unlawful conduct by making investments in prisons or companies that provide goods and services to prisons; and indeed Harvard’s investments are entirely lawful,” the motion reads.
The motion to dismiss also states that the plaintiffs’ “false advertising claims” should be dismissed. The authors of the motion argue that the plaintiffs in the lawsuit failed to demonstrate that the University made any “false or misleading” statements of fact.
The lawsuit’s definition of false advertising is based on a state law, M.G.L. c. 266, § 91, which prohibits “untrue or misleading advertisements.” The motion to dismiss asserts that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that Harvard’s information constituted “advertising” under the statute, and that the plaintiffs constituted a “aggrieved party.”
Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign published a press release Wednesday opposing the University's motion.
“In the midst of uprisings for Black Lives across the country and throughout the world, Harvard continues to defend its racist profiteering through its investments in the prison-industrial complex,” the press release reads. “These investments uphold and expand an industry that targets and cages Black people.”
Xitlalli Alvarez Almendariz, a plaintiff in the lawsuit and a doctoral student in Anthropology, linked the lawsuit to the ongoing movements for racial justice and prison abolition. Alvarez Almendariz criticized Harvard’s response to several recent high-profile police killings.
“It seems like the response is just more words and fluffy language and less concrete actions around the things that could actually constitute real transformation of the institution and address anti-Black racism, and also address how systemically Harvard is complicit in anti-Black racism, such as its investments in the prison industrial complex, such as its denial of tenure of Black faculty and other faculty who are making real critiques at the systemic level,” Alvarez Almendariz said.
Amanda T. Chan, a plaintiff in the lawsuit and a recent graduate of Harvard Law School, referenced Bacow’s characterization of the murder of George Floyd as “senseless” in arguing for divestment from the prison industry.
“If the killing of George Floyd was senseless, then what are the investments in these weapons that are used to kill Black people?” Chan said. “Some might say that by extension, they’re senseless as well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School professors are split on the validity of University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s legal arguments in his Monday announcement that the University would abandon its social group sanctions in response to a recent Supreme Court decision on sex discrimination.
The College introduced the sanctions in 2016, effectively barring members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from receiving postgraduate fellowships and holding athletics captaincies or leadership positions in extracurricular groups.
In an email to Harvard affiliates, Bacow explained that the June 15 Supreme Court decision in Bostock vs. Clayton County — which determined that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination against BGLTQ employees — would make the sanctions unlikely to survive judicial scrutiny.
Law School professor Noah R. Feldman ’92 described the University’s decision to drop the sanctions in light of the Supreme Court ruling as a “reasonable position.”
“I am open to the argument that structural logic of the Bostock ruling, with its formalism in the treatment of what counts as discrimination because of sex, is certainly very likely to be considered relevant by the judge deciding the Harvard case,” Feldman said.
In his email announcement, Bacow explained that the judge overseeing a pending lawsuit over the sanctions, district court judge Nathaniel M. Gorton, heavily referenced an appellate decision affirmed by the Bostock ruling when he rejected Harvard’s request to dismiss the sanctions suit. This fact, Bacow argued, would make Gorton unlikely to side with Harvard if the lawsuit progressed.
Other experts, however, were more skeptical of Harvard’s legal logic. Law School professor Benjamin M. Eidelson wrote in an email that he believes the Bostock ruling does not directly undermine the University’s social sanctions.
“The argument that was apparently decisive here strikes me as quite weak. If the policy were based on whether you’re in a club with just people of the same sex, then sure, maybe that’s like a policy based on whether you’re in a relationship with someone of the same sex,” Eidelson wrote.
“But as I understand it, the policy is actually based on whether you’re in a club that itself discriminates on the basis of sex—or at least, the policy could easily be reformulated that way. And that anti-discrimination policy doesn’t turn on any facts about how any student's sex compares to the sex of anybody else, so it doesn’t fall within the logic of the Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock,” he wrote.
Law School professor Jeannie Suk Gersen also wrote in an email that she believes the sanctions were not “analogous” to the subject of the Bostock case.
“I don’t see how Harvard’s policy on single-sex organizations, whatever its merits, is analogous to treating a man who marries a man worse than a woman who marries a man,” Gersen wrote. “In my view, that analogy is an incorrect application of Bostock.”
Though Gersen wrote that she does not believe the Supreme Court’s decision “would vindicate” Harvard’s analysis of the Bostock decision, she also wrote that she understands Harvard’s desire to stop litigating the sanctions.
“I think President Bacow made the right decision,” Gersen said of the decision to drop the sanctions. “I do not think it was compelled by Bostock, but it arguably could be seen through the light of Bostock.”
“I think Harvard has to make choices about which lawsuits it feels like defending and which issues are important enough to really fight for, and I think Harvard has made the decision that that one is not as important as some other things it is currently defending in the courts, such as the Harvard admissions case,” she said.
