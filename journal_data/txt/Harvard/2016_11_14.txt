After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s hard not to be overwhelmed with gratitude when you first step onto Harvard’s campus. We have access to an unimaginable wealth of resources at this school. Naturally, this sense of gratitude can act as a form of positivity. Recently, positive psychologists have raved about gratitude and its relation to happiness. Studies on depression in undergraduate students suggest that gratitude can help raise self-esteem levels and therefore even decrease suicidal ideation.
But I have a problem with gratitude—namely how it can act as a form of complacency. Though all of us are lucky to be at this school, living in a constant state of crippling indebtedness to this institution can also get in the way of progress. Furthermore, over-enforcing gratitude can invalidate voices of criticism, many of which belong to marginalized students who face very real and relevant issues at this school.
This sense of undying gratitude can come from many sources, including internal ones. The Harvard Bureau of Study Council’s “I’m a First-Gen: Am I the Only One Who?” document notes that many first-gen students feel guilty for simply being here at Harvard and surrounded by all its myriad resources, especially in light of those who are not as lucky back home. If first-gen students like me feel guilty for simply being surrounded by so many resources, how guilty must we feel for wanting more?
More often, however, marginalized students at elite institutions have to deal with others who tell them to be grateful. They portray these “ungrateful” students as asking for too much. When I attended prep school, one of my teachers failed to submit my recommendations for the Gates Millennium Scholars Program, which provides full scholarships and a support network to low-income college students. I asked an adult member of the school community to call the Gates Foundation (which sponsors the scholarship program) to look for a solution, explaining the difficulty of my transition to prep school as a full-financial aid, first-gen student without such a program. While he celebrated my hard work and the challenges I had overcome, he subtly let me know my place in that school: He told me that life was hard and that I should simply be grateful for the opportunities that had been handed to me in life.
This outside over-enforcement of gratitude further perpetuates the sense that the voices of underrepresented students don’t matter. When students of color at Bowdoin became increasingly vocal after the Michael Brown shooting, one of the students, Caroline Martinez, wrote in a column in the Bowdoin Orient that they were told to “just be grateful that we’re here and suck it up.” Martinez continued, “I am grateful for Bowdoin’s efforts to try to even the playing field…. But I also feel that my sense of gratitude has kept me and many students quiet for a while, and now that we’re speaking out, there seems to be a type of backlash. Students of color who want their elite institutions to change have been painted as privileged, whiny kids. There is an attitude of, ‘Shut up and be grateful.’”
I don’t want to demonize gratitude. Instead, we should be wary of confusing gratitude with complacency. Every day, I walk into Annenberg and see the portrait of Richard Theodore Greener, the first African-American to graduate from Harvard. I often walk by Radcliffe Yard—where female students studied for so long—and I get to enjoy events held by the First Generation Student Union, surrounded by so many peers whose backgrounds wouldn’t have been represented at this university 50 years ago. Every day, I celebrate progress, and I am grateful for it.
But every day, I also grapple with the fact that this institution has been investigated twice by the federal government for its compliance with Title IX in recent years, has yet to expand its freshmen gender-neutral housing, and proposed a contract that would have increased healthcare costs for dining hall workers.
More than the gratitude I feel for this institution, I am grateful for those before me who have spoken up against the status quo and worked tirelessly to make this school and society at large a better place for all of us to live. I am grateful for those who continue to speak up despite the backlash that they face. We should all take time to celebrate how far we have come in improving our society, but we should not shy away from thinking about the ways we can continue to improve. It’s not ingratitude to expect better from the society you live in—it’s progress.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last year at Harvard has certainly been eventful. In light of the ongoing discourse on final clubs and sexual assault and amid work being done to increase the inclusivity of social spaces, a strong leadership of the student body is more paramount than ever. After speaking with each of the four tickets, we believe that three of the four are prepared to lead the Undergraduate Council.
Students would be hard pressed to go wrong by choosing Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 and Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 or Scott Ely ’18 and Evan M. Bonsall ’19. Both tickets have extensive experience with the Council and would provide strong leadership. The ticket of Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18 and Alex Popovski ’19, however, stands above the rest.
Not only do they offer actionable responses to the salient issues facing the community today, but their ticket is also best prepared to lead the student body through Harvard’s current climate of apprehension.
We believe that Gonzalez and Popovski have managed to formulate realistic plans that can immediately benefit the student body. Both of them have extensive experience with the UC and are familiar with its inherent limitations. Accordingly, their ticket neither makes lofty promises nor establishes quixotic goals, but, instead, offers reasonable plans like expediting party-registration, extending dining hall access to Counseling and Mental Health Services clinicians, and creating a textbook exchange system for students. All of these ideas area realistic and have a good chance of being implemented.
This ticket is best poised to support students during a time of uncertainty in many facets of the Harvard experience. While Gonzalez has actively sought to make education at Harvard more inclusive, Popovski has played an active role in planning social events and making health more accessible. With the College’s decision to sanction unrecognized single-gender social organizations, questions of inclusivity and social spaces remain highly salient. With their combined experience Gonzalez and Popovski are prepared to support students in this historic dialogue. Similarly, we commend this ticket for bringing attention to undocumented students and calling for greater administrative support of them.
We also laud all of the candidates for making mental health on campus a priority in their campaigns. In the wake of the presidential election and the challenges of inclusivity and tolerance facing the country, ensuring that Harvard’s mental health services work for all students will be more important than ever. It will be crucial to offer additional support to mental health counseling groups as well as student affinity groups, both of which play a vital role in making the college a more welcoming place. Such promises are made and re-made with each UC presidential campaign. We hope this year is the one in which transformative change finally occurs.
Despite our preference for Gonzalez and Popovski, it bears repeating that three of this year’s tickets clearly have the knowledge and experience necessary to lead the UC. Whichever pair wins, we urge the future President and Vice-President to work with their opponents to ensure that the Council implements a truly inclusive vision for the College.
We must also acknowledge that the influence of the UC continually ebbs and flows, with greater relevance some years than others. We hope the victors come to terms with this history of failed initiatives and accordingly temper their ambitions while doubling down on their most executable recommendations. In light of this qualification, we reaffirm that the Gonzalez-Popovski ticket has the best prospects of providing students with this much-needed leadership.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the preeminent institution of its kind, Harvard University has remained committed to diversity—as stated in its mission—and to its aim “to remove restraints on students’ full participation” in the Harvard community. The result of last week’s presidential election announcement makes this mission more pressing than ever, especially for the undocumented student community which has been particularly under threat throughout this election cycle.
Harvard’s mission demands that the administration move beyond releasing a statement and implement concrete actions that protect all Harvard students—especially those members of our community who have been targets of discrimination during a hate-filled and anxiety-inducing election.
Thus, we ask: what does the election of Donald J. Trump mean to the undocumented students currently enrolled at Harvard? Trump’s first change to immigration policy will in all likelihood affect these students, many—if not all—of whom currently benefit from President Obama’s executive order: Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. This order currently safeguards students from deportation, grants them work authorization, and enables them to obtain driver's licenses. Hence, DACA has opened doors for employment, greater participation in America’s democracy, and a unique sense of belonging. Not only is Trump an imminent threat to DACA, but he has also threatened to block and overturn other progressive immigration policies. President-elect Donald J. Trump now possesses the power to materialize his words with the support of our Congress, making the repeal of vital immigration policies not only possible, but frighteningly plausible.
For many years, Harvard has admitted undocumented students: students who were brought to the U.S. as children and who have been designated as unlawful. In addition to experiencing obstacles by virtue of their intersectional identities, undocumented students face additional challenges given their legal status. Not only are undocumented students ineligible to work, but they are also ineligible for federal aid, most private assistance, and work-study programs. Undocumented students are forced to navigate a complex legal framework on their own. Thus, Harvard’s lack of a centralized support system further complicates the experiences of undocumented students, ultimately dropping the University’s responsibility to support students onto Harvard College Act on a Dream, a student-run organization.
In admitting students from at-risk and marginalized communities, Harvard has the obligation to provide these members of our community with an equitable and just education which requires the creation of spaces and the allocation of resources that would support them and allow them to excel at Harvard University and beyond. Harvard prides itself on its diversity and inclusion. Let’s then support our diverse population in this hour of increased fear and need.
We do not write in search of symbolic support. Harvard has a duty, now more than ever, to support the undocumented students at the College and in graduate programs through institutional support that has woefully been missing for years.
Given that the current Dean of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion announced her departure at the beginning of the semester, the University must immediately hire a new administrator and equip them with the necessary funding and infrastructure (i.e., full time staff) to implement necessary changes to ensure the safety, mental health, and intellectual development of all students regardless of identity, race, socioeconomic background, sexual orientation, gender identity, and immigration status.
Even with the position filled, the umbrella of issues that fall under this Dean’s purview is so large that undocumented students are left without support. To prevent this, the University must immediately hire a full-time Assistant Dean under the Dean of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion to specifically support the undocumented/DACA-mented undergraduates and graduate students.
Resources for undocumented students are currently decentralized and often difficult to find. To fix this, the University must institute an Office for Undocumented Student Support to serve as a resource center for undocumented students and students of mixed-legal status families, actively defending students from the aforementioned threats given the imminent, divisive political climate. It must also expand existing funds and establish a distinct budget for undocumented students and students in mixed-status families to cover fees associated with immigration-related legal proceedings.
In addition, Harvard must hire at least one mental health professional who has cultural competency in working with politically marginalized communities, trauma-related issues of familial separation, and the chronic threat of deportation. The University should also proclaim Harvard Memorial Church as part of the network of sanctuary churches that provide a refuge for students facing deportation proceedings.
The danger undocumented students face now is due to gaps in education pertaining to how this nation was founded. It is paramount that the University significantly increase the percentage of tenured faculty of color, specifically those teaching courses related to Ethnicity, Migration, and Rights and Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. Courses added should engage with the undocumented experience in a way that does not place the burden of instruction on undocumented students.
We do not need your words of comfort, your pity, or your sympathy. We need action that demonstrates this University’s dedication to supporting all of its students, regardless of their immigration status. Undocumented students live among us, contribute to our community, and participate in intellectual life at Harvard and beyond. Harvard is responsible for their safety and intellectual freedom, which cannot be guaranteed without ensuring their safety from threats of violence, family separation and deportation. We need action now.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past week sucked. The shocking reality of President-elect Trump is hitting slowly and painfully. I would be lying if I said it didn’t cross my mind that my degree in Government is trash and that public service is dead. That it doesn’t matter if you outright lie or have no real policy plans—the American people will elect you anyway. It’s been difficult to walk around Harvard and feel like someone actually did die, like we collectively suffered a terrible loss.
But in lieu of wallowing in our grief, I want to try to make sense of things by talking about something that always comforts me: Southern-style barbecue.
Where I grew up in eastern North Carolina, barbecue is a staple. And I’m not talking about just the vinegar-based shredded pork; I also mean the process of getting the whole community together for a potluck-style cookout. Especially during election season, candidates for public office rely on a big barbecue to feed hundreds of people coming out to their events. Herbert O’Keefe, the editor of the Raleigh Times during the 1950s, once remarked, “No man has ever been elected governor of North Carolina without eating more barbecue than was good for him.” Voters know that watching how a candidate treats their barbecue can tell them a great deal about that candidate’s values.
For a region still grappling with lingering prejudices, the South boasts food that is uniquely accessible, classless, ubiquitous, and immensely delicious, to say the least. No matter who you are, where you grew up, what color your skin is, how you worship, or how much money you make, you too eat and appreciate the comfort of Southern cooking.
In the wake of the election, I’m struggling with a profound sense of disconnect. I feel the pain of my friends of color, people who feel like their elementary school bullies just got elected Leader of the Free World. I feel their fear that this may galvanize people who act out of hate. I feel the distress of those who may not be safe or welcome in this country because of their religious identity. I feel my own pain that no matter how hard a woman works, she’s still not good enough. I’m in pain knowing we awarded the presidency to a man caught on camera bragging about sexual assault.
But I know that I have family and friends who voted for Trump. I know that I have no idea what it’s like to be financially insecure or worry about supporting a family. I don’t know what it’s like to have my job exported out of the country and lack the training or opportunities to earn a stable income. Fortunate enough to attend a college like Harvard, I do not know what it’s like to feel ignored or dismissed by elite special interests.
When I think about how to reconcile the disconnect between what I feel and what I know, I think about what it means to have a barbecue. Barbecue, the food and the event, doesn’t belong to any one person or group. It’s great because it’s for everyone. And you can only have a barbecue by bringing people together, outdoors or at a table; the conversation is just as crucial as the food.
Since the election, many people have mentioned the necessity of “understanding the Trump voter” and engaging in meaningful dialogue. And I recognize the reality of how hard those conversations are going to be. I know there’s distress and fear for many people in this country, regardless of whom you supported (or didn’t support) for president. I know I myself need time to grapple with the election before I can have those discussions.
But the sadness I feel about the outcome of this election is not greater than the sadness I feel about the prospect of a country divided, unable to speak to one another because of our political beliefs. The late Justice Scalia’s creed is more important now than ever: “Some very good people have some very bad ideas.” There are 60 million people in this country who supported Trump, and I refuse to write those people off entirely as racists or sexists or xenophobes.
The solution to our political problems might just be politics—albeit of a different definition. Instead of the horserace style, Clinton v. Trump, outsider v. establishment politics, we may need to rethink how we politick among ourselves. We may need a nation-wide barbecue, the opportunity discuss our experiences and be open about our fears. We need to know the “other,” and think about how to solve our nation’s biggest challenges. And it starts with you, with me. It starts with honesty and commitment to respect, and tough conversations with your family and neighbors at Thanksgiving.
So roll up your sleeves and pull up a chair: We’re having a barbecue. And if your religion prevents you from eating pork, don’t worry; I brought candied yams and collared greens, too.

To the Editor:
I am a doctoral student at the Graduate School of Education. I sincerely thank the student organizers of HGSU for their conscientious activism, which is extremely important to our community. However I oppose unionization, because in the big picture it will harm our university and the goals we’re all trying to achieve. My interests are not different from the University’s. I came here to learn in a dynamic and innovative environment, and to contribute to positive change—not to earn elevated wages as a TF.  I believe the idea that we would somehow benefit from a union is naive. What the administration and students both need is the flexibility and freedom to choose how to allocate our time and resources to best achieve our goals. A labor relations model would achieve just the opposite. It would introduce rigidity, distort incentives, and obstruct positive change.   A “union” would in fact be nothing of the sort, as it would pit students and administration against each other. Moreover, it would pit us students against ourselves, as our diverse preferences and viewpoints would be steamrolled into a single, monopolistic position by “majority” vote (a haunting prospect after last week’s presidential election). We will lose the freedom to make our own choices as free agents.
I also do not see why we need monopolistic collective bargaining in the first place. We are not a vulnerable group, and Harvard is not an exploitative employer. We already have better, more flexible structures available for communicating our needs as a group.  Even if we classify ourselves as “workers”, the most important thing for workers is to be embedded in an environment in which we can grow. Our relationship with the University is already structured this way. If we form a union, we will change a relationship of mutual support and growth into one of rigid rules and adversarial negotiation. This would be harmful for everyone involved (except the United Auto Workers).  Please consider voting “no” when voting tomorrow and Thursday.
Andrew S. Conning is a doctoral student at the Graduate School of Education.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Election and campaign finance lawyer Jerry H. Goldfeder encouraged Americans to remain resilient in light of the presidential election results at a Law School event on Friday.
Invited by the Harvard Law School Democrats, Goldfeder gave a talk entitled “After 2016, Do Our Election Laws Still Work?”, one of many discussions about election laws in which he has participated on campuses across the country. Friday’s presentation was particularly timely, following the unexpected victory of Donald Trump in the presidential election.
Goldfeder, who served on the National Finance Committee of Hillary Clinton's campaign, began the presentation by highlighting the messages conveyed in Clinton’s concession speech.
“Her remarks, like the President’s remarks, were extremely critical,” Goldfeder said. “She also talked about the importance of our responsibility as citizens, as voters, to make sure that we guard the rights, the hard-earned rights, that we won over the years.”
Addressing the fact that Clinton won the popular vote but not the Electoral College, Goldfeder continued by discussing contemporary election laws in the context of the recent election.
“Modern America is burdened by the fact that decisions were made in Philadelphia in 1787 and we are still living with them,” Goldfeder said. “And the most important one this week is, ‘you won the election but you didn’t win the election.’”
Goldfeder addressed what he called drawbacks of the current electoral system, explaining that 48 states—not including Maine and Nebraska—and Washington D.C. use a plurality system to elect presidential candidates, and referenda to change the status quo rarely pass.
“Whoever wins a plurality not a majority... in the state gets the whole thing, gets all the electors,” Goldfeder said. “There have been proposals to change the way we award our electors.”
He referenced a 2004 referendum in Colorado to introduce a proportional system for appropriating votes as an example of efforts to update the Electoral College. That referendum, however, ultimately did not pass.
Despite failed efforts like the one in Colorado, Goldfeder argued for the continued importance of evaluating the electoral system, especially given the political climate following the election.
The Democrats “lost the election because of our Constitutional prescriptions,” Goldfeder said. “So maybe... the legal and political direction we go in is attempting to change the way the system has functioned for all these many years—this anachronistic, bizarre system—either through the national popular vote or through amending the Constitution.”
Megan P. Ma, a Canadian citizen and visiting law student from the Paris political studies school Sciences Po, expressed her thoughts on the election and election laws following the event.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Donald Trump’s victory and the prospect of a fiercely anti-immigrant administration in the White House has mobilized more than 4,000 people to sign a petition calling upon Harvard’s administration to protect the University’s undocumented students.
Demanding that Harvard hire new staff and implement several other “concrete actions,” student organizers are planning to deliver the petition to administrators on Monday afternoon against the backdrop of a rally on the steps of Widener Library.
Trump’s unexpected win over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton—fueled in part by nationalist appeal and the promise to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico—sent shockwaves through Harvard’s campus, provoking a particularly strong reaction from students of color who fear they will be disproportionately targeted by his policies. Many of the roughly 40 undocumented students at the College expressed fear of deportation under a Trump administration.
The petition calls for immediate action, citing Harvard’s commitment to diversity and Trump’s threats to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which confers legal presence, a Social Security number, and a work permit to many of Harvard’s undocumented students.
Of the petition’s seven demands, the first is the immediate hiring of a new Assistant Dean of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion to replace Emelyn A. dela Peña, who left Harvard last month. Other requests include the creation of an office to support undocumented students.
“We do not need words of comfort, your pity, or your sympathy,” the petition reads. “We need action that demonstrates this University’s dedication to concretely support all of its students, regardless of their immigration status.”
Several students in Spanish 126: “Performing Latinidad,” taught by assistant professor Lorgia H. Garcia Peña, authored the petition and are organizing Monday’s protest. The class, which focuses on Latino identity in film, art, and literature, incorporates performance art into its curriculum.
This will not be the first demonstration to come from the class. Last week, just prior to Election Day Nov. 8, students in the class carried a casket around the Yard, set up fake “polling stations,” and bashed a piñata emblazoned with Trump’s slogan “Make America Great Again.” The performances were designed by students in collaboration with Dominican performance artist Josefina Báez. Spanish 126 student and protest organizer Anastacia Valdespino ’18 said Monday’s protest will likely be more direct and “political in nature.”
“There have been so many big rallies across the country at universities, with people protesting Trump’s win, and it’s been kind of disappointing that our campus hasn’t had one of those,” Valdespino said. “We are doing this specific demonstration [for undocumented students] because it’s more tangible, and not just a symbolic response.”
Mario George ’18 said the students in Spanish 126 were particularly moved to demonstrate because of “the number of students who would be affected by the election results.”
“We divided into different roles, like writing the petition and planning the programming for the demonstration,” George said. “The protest is meant to rally people around in solidarity with undocumented students, who feel a sense of fear given the election results, who have a sense of complete uncertainty about what their futures will look like.”
Enrique Ramirez ’17, an undocumented student and board member of student immigration advocacy group Act on a Dream, said he hopes Monday’s protest is “educational.”
“The first aim is to make sure that people are aware that there are undocumented students at Harvard,” Ramirez said. “I think seeing Harvard students and hearing about their experiences will be really powerful.
Daishi M. Tanaka ’19, an undocumented student and advocacy chair for Act on a Dream, said he is “optimistic” about administrators’ support for undocumented students after meeting with Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair and Director of Diversity and Inclusion Programs Loc Truong.
“There is public support that will be demonstrated, and the protest will be necessary,” Tanaka said. “Hopefully, as the undocumented students channel their voices and their opinions about what solution works best, they can communicate with administrators to form solutions.”
Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair wrote in an email, “The Office of Student Life is committed to supporting undocumented students, many of whom have expressed fear and anxiety over what might happen with the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).”
The petition has collected the endorsement of three academic programs: Romance Languages and Literatures, the Committee on Degrees in Ethnicity and Migration Rights, and Women and Gender Studies. Several members of the Committee on Degrees in History and Literature signed the petition, although the committee did not endorse it collectively.
Sergio Delgado, a professor in Romance Languages and Literatures, circulated the petition among students and colleagues and urged them to sign it. Delgado, himself an immigrant, said he thought it was important to “hold the institution accountable.”
“So far, this hasn’t been an issue that resonates with as much urgency as it should, and I think that’s changing,” Delgado said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three of the four tickets seeking to lead next year’s Undergraduate Council said in a debate Friday night they are opposed to the College’s announced sanctions against unrecognized single-gender social organizations.
When asked to comment on the issue by Crimson debate moderators, only one pair of candidates—that of presidential hopeful Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18 and running mate Alex Popovski ’19—indicated support for the policy, “conditionally.” They said they are in favor of gender equity—one of the College’s main motivators for the sanctions—but believe that the formulation of the policy was “handled poorly,” Gonzalez said. 
Announced in May, the policy bars members of all unrecognized single-gender social organizations, such as final clubs and Greek organizations, from holding leadership positions in recognized student groups, becoming varsity athletic captains, and receiving Harvard endorsements for prestigious fellowships. The announcement of the sanctions, which will go into effect for members of the Class of 2021 and beyond, was met with widespread condemnation from graduate leaders of male and female final clubs, national Greek organizations, and many undergraduate women—though some students, coaches of athletic teams, professors, and members of the Harvard Corporation expressed support.
Echoing others who have criticized the policy, UC presidential hopeful Scott Ely ’18 said Friday, “We believe that there is a fundamental disconnect between the stated goals of the University—namely reducing the incidents of sexual assault, and inclusivity—and the policy that they’re actually trying to implement.”
Another presidential candidate, Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18, who is a member of the all-female Bee Club, said, “It’s a one-size-fits-all policy—a policy that is not nuanced, and gets rid of women’s spaces on campus.”
Moderated by members of The Crimson staff, the “Crimson Crossfire” debate was held Friday night in Sever Hall. Candidates responded to questions about their policies and views on hot-button issues such as mental health on campus and the U.S. Presidential election.
The candidates include: Sachee and running mate Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18; Ely and Evan M. Bonsall ’19; Grant S. Solomon ’18 and running mate Alexander T. Moore ’18; and Gonzalez and Popovski.
All candidates found common ground when they responded affirmatively to a question asking whether they would support undocumented students at Harvard in light of the election of Donald Trump to the nation’s highest office last Tuesday.
Since then, students across campus have organized in support of undocumented peers out of concern for how the President-Elect’s immigration policies could affect their ability to continue their education at Harvard: A petition, circulated on social media and House lists over the past few days, called on administrators to support Harvard’s undocumented immigrants by hiring a new Dean of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion, creating an office to support undocumented students, and establishing a new budget to aid undocumented students in immigration-related legal proceedings.
All UC candidates said they had signed, or planned to sign, the petition.
Despite sharing similar stances on several controversial issues, the candidates sought to distinguish themselves based on their past experiences on the UC and argued that their tickets would be best equipped to represent the full diversity of the undergraduate body.
“Experience is not a guarantor of wisdom or insight,” said Bonsall, one of two sophomores running for vice president. “It’s the work done—not time on the Council, but what you achieved on the Council.”
No ticket with a sophomore candidate has won the election in nine years.
Still, not all of the tickets have previously served on the UC. Presidential candidate and tennis player Solomon and running mate, sprinter Moore, are running as an outsider ticket. Last year, a pair of varsity wrestlers, Nick E. Gajdzik ’16-’17 and Jeffrey M. Ott ’16-’17, ran on a similar platform of supporting student athletes on campus.
“Running in our first or second year, we consider almost foolish, not knowing the community and the people and unique perspectives they have,” Solomon said. “Now that we know—not everyone—but more folks on this campus and the groups that they belong to and the values they hold, now is the time to take the plunge, give it a shot and create real change.”
Moore, who is also a member of the all-male Fox Club, added, “We bring an outsider’s perspective and we recognize that… But 99 percent of Harvard is not on the UC. They’re just normal students, and we want to have conversations with them and get everyone involved with what we’re doing in the UC.”
Gonzalez likewise emphasized what he said is his ticket’s ability to represent the needs of all Harvard students, including women and minority groups. “We’re two straight, cisgender men,” Gonzalez said, referring to himself and his running mate. “But that means we just have to work twice, three times as hard to hear inclusive perspectives.”
Vice-presidential candidate Khansarinia said his ticket would be the best one for including more women’s perspectives in the Council, referencing his running mate Sachee, the only woman candidate in this year’s election.
“That’s why I partnered with—not just one of the strongest female leaders on the Council—one of the strongest leaders on campus,” he said. “The work she’s already done in almost doubling the amount of female leaders on this Council not only shows that she is a great leader but that she wants to empower other female leaders on this campus.”
Voting for the UC presidency and vice presidency will open online Nov. 14 and close Nov. 17.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After months of anticipation, eager Sweetgreen fans flocked to the chain’s new Harvard Square location last week to attend “soft opening” events in preparation for the salad chain’s official opening Tuesday.
The Square’s latest culinary addition is located at 39 JFK St., a building owned by Hong Kong billionaire and prominent Harvard donor Gerald Chan. In anticipation of the opening, Sweetgreen has held numerous casual events aimed at drumming up buzz.
Plans for Cambridge’s first Sweetgreen location were announced last March. According to Sweetgreen spokesperson Amy Clark, the eatery was originally scheduled to open this past summer.
“Opening a location in Harvard Square really aligned with the foundation of how we started and why we do what we do,” said Sweetgreen area manager Jason Hopkins. “People are excited to be here and we are excited to be a part of it.”
The chain’s pre-opening events—which featured free salads for customers who registered to attend online—garnered local interest.
Sweetgreen will host its last pre-opening event on Monday which the company calls a “neighborhood day,” an occasion for giving out free salad to Cantabrigians.
“On Monday we are going to have a neighborhood day to invite the neighborhood to come in and have lunch on us,” Hopkins said. “This is really our introduction to Harvard Square.”
Sweetgreen is an east coast-based salad chain founded in 2007 by three Georgetown graduates. Since then, the chain has expanded, with locations in California, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere. Sweetgreen’s Harvard Square opening marks the chain's 10th Boston-area store and first Cambridge location.
Hopkins said all the proceeds from the store’s official opening on Tuesday will be donated to the Food Project, a non-profit organization that educates teenagers on sustainable agriculture by employing them on farms located in Lincoln, Roxbury, and the North Shore of Massachusetts.
“It is an incredible organization and really aligns with who we are,” Hopkins said.  “We are truly going to give back everything that we can on Tuesday.”
Riya N. Patel ’18 attended one of the pre-opening events and said the eatery exuded “good vibes” and was “excited” for another healthy option for meals in the Square.
“The staff was super energetic and friendly, and I loved the atmosphere of the place,” Patel said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SHANGHAI—At an alumni event here Friday meant to showcase Harvard’s men’s basketball team, Vice Provost for International Affairs Mark C. Elliott condemned a sexually explicit “scouting report” produced by a member of the 2012 men’s soccer team.
“We expect the very highest standards of our student athletes,” Elliott said. “We almost always realize those expectations. But there are times when we fall short, and as many of you will have read in recent weeks, we have had some disappointing news from the men’s soccer team as well as from the men’s cross country team.”
Men’s basketball traveled to Shanghai last week to play against Stanford in the annual Pac-12 China Game and a Chinese team in an exhibition game.
At the event Friday, about 100 alumni, former Harvard basketball players, professors, and University deans gathered in the Harvard Center Shanghai. Elliott updated alumni about University business, including the cancellation of the men’s soccer season after Harvard’s Office of the General Counsel found the team continued to produce vulgar documents rating women on their perceived sexual appeal and physical appearance through 2016. The University’s legal counsel reviewed the team after The Crimson first reported on the 2012 “scouting report” last month.
Last week, The Crimson also reported that past men’s cross country teams produced yearly spreadsheets matching members of the women’s team with members of the men’s team ahead of an annual dance. Some of these spreadsheets were “sexually explicit,” according to team captain Brandon E. Price ’17.
Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise was originally slated to travel with the team, but cancelled his trip “in part” because Harvard found the soccer team continued to produce the documents.
Elliott applauded University President Drew G. Faust for asking the Office of the General Counsel to review the men’s soccer team, whose actions he called “scandalous.”
“The message was sent, sent very clearly, not at Harvard. This kind of thing doesn’t happen at Harvard. Can’t be allowed to happen. Can’t go unpunished,” he said.
“We stand as one Harvard, committed to ensuring that sexist and misogynistic conduct on campus doesn’t happen, that it has no place at Harvard,” Elliott continued. “Not on the playing field, not in the classroom, not in the laboratory, not in our offices, nowhere. And with a woman leading the University as president, really how could it be otherwise?”
Pusey Minister in Memorial Church Jonathan L. Walton also spoke at the alumni event, discussing the importance of intercollegiate athletics at Harvard and how the interaction between the men’s and women’s programs should act as a model for university athletics to develop strong morals and combat sexism and racism.
“Harvard basketball models for us why diversity is so important,” Walton said. “I’ve witnessed kids across racial, regional, ethnic, national, and gender lines learning from one another, supporting one another, inspiring one another, to dig deeper, to stretch further, to reach higher. This is what men’s and women’s athletics can provide, particularly when the teams work together across gender lines.”
During a question and answer portion of the night, alumni also asked how the University was responding to the election of President-Elect Donald Trump.
Elliott said that while much about Trump’s future administration is still to be determined, he indicated the University has begun to consider the implications of his victory. Elliott, in his role as vice provost for international affairs, said he was concerned for undocumented immigrants at Harvard.
“I think that we are mindful of the fact that by admitting these students to the University, we have committed to a kind of contract with them, a moral contract certainly, and it’s certainly my hope, and I think that it would be shared by most of us, that this is a commitment we need to hold to,” Elliott said. “How to do that is a more complicated question for sure and it’s one that we’re giving very serious thought to.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Student groups receiving funding from the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations’ Student Advisory Committee will be eligible for more funding if their board members undergo sexual assault prevention training as a result of an agreement between the Harvard Foundation and the Undergraduate Council.
Under the new policy—jointly sponsored by the UC, the Harvard Foundation, and the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response—student organizations whose entire boards undergo OSAPR-run sexual assault prevention training are eligible to receive 20 percent in additional funding from the Harvard Foundation beginning next semester.
If half of a student organization’s board attends training, the group will be eligible for a 10 percent funding increase.
“Our role... will be to help create some of this institutional change to combat sexual assault on campus,” Harvard Foundation Student Advisory Committee co-chair Dylan de Waart ’19 said. “You can’t have an ‘Open Harvard’ without a safe Harvard.”
De Waart co-authored the policy along with UC Finance Committee Chair William A. Greenlaw ’17, Pforzheimer House UC representative Neel Mehta ’18, and Student Advisory Committee co-chair Yousra Neberai ’18.
The policy supplements an initiative from the Council’s Finance Committee passed last semester that mandates sexual assault training for officers of the 20 percent of student groups that receive the most UC grants each semester. More than 70 students have received training through the policy.
Greenlaw said the new partnership with the Harvard Foundation would help expand training to groups that the UC may not ordinarily reach.
“While the UC very much does its best to cater to all students on campus, there are some places where we don't have the most influence,” Greenlaw said. “I think this is a step one to an even wider goal.”
The UC also passed a statement at their Sunday meeting affirming support for students of all identities in light of Donald Trump’s victory in last Tuesday’s presidential election. Though most representatives voiced support for the statement, seven UC members voted against the statement, including Council Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17 and Mather House representative Nicholas D. Boucher ’19.
“Even though the intention isn't to make political assumptions, I think that it does,” Boucher said.
In a Crimson survey of undergraduates conducted last month, 87 percent of respondents said they would vote for Hillary Clinton as President of the United States. Only six percent, meanwhile, said they would vote for Trump.
During the meeting, UC members also unanimously endorsed an open letter calling on Harvard University Health Services to eliminate student fees for accessing health records, give students the ability to view and download health records online, and allow students to use third-party applications to access health information.
Representatives from SwellBox—an online healthcare record service that students could be able to use under this measure—presented at the meeting on the issue. Former SwellBox intern Jefferson E. Seidl ’16 said the proposals would improve access to healthcare resources for student athletes especially.
“Harvard students, because of the archaic structure that UHS uses, are not given full ownership of their health records,” Siedl said.

A loosely organized effort opposed to student unionization has escalated its activities in the leadup to this week’s vote on whether students from across Harvard’s graduate schools and the College will form a collective bargaining unit.
Graduate students against establishing a union circulated an email to fellow students Thursday with their main points against unionization, and have created a Facebook page to share their views.
This week’s coming vote is the culmination of several years of work to organize a graduate student union. A federal ruling in August cleared the path for students to bargain collectively.
The anti-unionization email, sent by Graduate School of Arts and Sciences student Momchil Tomov, was signed by 18 graduate students and listed the arguments against voting in favor of the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers union effort. The majority of the signatories are students in the sciences and engineering.
“We are a group of graduate students who believe that while the possible benefits of unionization have been widely advertised, the potential disruptions and disadvantages have been downplayed or ignored,” the email reads.
“We are not against unions: we are against this union,” the email continues. “We work with Harvard, not against it. Our needs are not best met by a labor-bargaining model.”
Among the students’ arguments is that the cost of dues will not be offset by potential stipend increases that result from collective bargaining. Other points argue that “a union will be disruptive to your academic experience” and that a “one-size-fits-all” contract will not be effective.
Pushing back, HGSU-UAW organizer and Ph.D. student Rudi Batzell wrote in an email to The Crimson, “The only thing we have promised is that we will have more power to negotiate improvements to pay, benefits and rights. Empirically, we have pointed out that collective bargaining have made things better.”
The students against the HGSU-UAW also argued that a conflict of interest arises because organizers are paid by the UAW—they claimed organizers are paid up to $500 a week.
Batzell wrote that he does not believe it is a conflict of interest. He added that part-time staff are “paid a flat rate”—of $500 per week for 20+ hours of work, according to the union effort’s website.
“No one is getting paid to change their position or opinions,” Batzell wrote. “Those willing to make sacrifices and commit their time are being fairly compensated.”
In addition to sending the email, opponents to the unionization effort have publicized their view on a Facebook page. Ph.D. student Jae Hyeon Lee created the “Against HGSU-UAW” page earlier this month. It has now garnered close to 330 likes. Lee said he created the page as a “forum” for those who may feel uncomfortable voicing their opinions, and “so people can hear the other side of the story as well.”
Lee has long been a vocal opponent of the Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers, but now other graduate students are also speaking up against unionization.
Union supporters have expressed skepticism at the motives of the students involved in the “Against HGSU-UAW” group—Batzell wrote that they employ similar tactics as the administration, and one student asked directly on the Facebook page if the group is in any way affiliated with the University.
Students involved with the group have stated their actions are independent of the administration.
Ph.D. student Elizabeth P. West, one of the signatories, said such allegations of administrative collusion are “disappointing.”
“There are many students that are pro-union who seem inclined to believe that it is not possible to oppose unionization without somehow having an ulterior motive, other than the best interests of Harvard’s community,” she said. “That’s been a little bit disappointing. I don’t find it intimidating, but I wish we could all argue in good faith.”
University spokesperson Ann Hall confirmed the administration’s lack of involvement, writing, “While GSAS is aware of the Against HGSU-UAW Facebook page and the email the group recently sent, we were not involved in the creation or dissemination of either.”
Students on both sides said they have been taken aback by the tense rhetoric.
Union organizer and Ph.D. student Avery A. Davis wrote in an email, “I have to say I am quite astounded at the level of vitriol on this page toward hundreds of graduate students at Harvard who have spent the last two years working to establish a voice through collective bargaining, which we believe will make our lives better and will make Harvard more inclusive and accessible in the process.”
Since sending the email articulating viewpoints against unionization, Tomov received several explicit emails from fellow students; one called him a “fascist,” and another wrote “I'm sure the President-elect is grateful for your work on this.”
Someone also signed Tomov’s email up for President-elect Donald Trump’s campaign mailing list, he wrote. He was also notified of four unidentified attempts to log into his Facebook account.
However, Tomov wrote that the inflammatory emails were in the minority. Some have thanked him for the information and expressed a desire to get involved, while others expressed a desire to not be contacted again, or respectfully rebutted the main points of the email.
Students eligible to vote will take part in secret ballot voting for or against forming a union between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. Nov. 16 and 17, with a two hour break at 2:30 p.m. Voting at the Business School will only take place Nov. 17 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
HAMDEN, Conn. — Early in the second period of Saturday night’s ECAC championship game rematch, the Harvard men’s hockey team did something it hadn’t done in over a season—take a lead against Quinnipiac.
Certainly not by chance, either—at the time, the No. 10/10 Crimson had twice as many shots as the No. 7/8 Bobcats, the same team that had scored six times on a whopping 54 tries on goal the night before.
But within 12 minutes, the lead vanished. And it vanished for good.
Despite continuing to control play for much of the night, Harvard let a statement win slip right through its fingers on Saturday, surrendering three unanswered goals to the defending ECAC champions in what amounted to a 4-2 Quinnipiac victory at High Point Solutions Arena. The Crimson (4-1-1, 2-1-1 ECAC) shot itself in the foot with nine penalties, shaky goaltending, and one too many special teams lapses.
“There’s ultimately a lot of factors that lead to winning games, and regardless of all the other stuff, special teams and goaltending are still at the top of the list,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “Those are two areas we need to be better at, and we’ll leave it at that.”
The Bobcats (7-3-1, 3-1-0) tied the game with 7:22 left in the second period, when top-line forward Craig Martin’s wrister from atop the right faceoff circle ate up junior goaltender Merrick Madsen, soaring right past his glove.
Three minutes later, Quinnipiac had a chance to pull ahead on the power play; yet, with the visitors possessing the puck with 20 seconds left on the man-up, the Crimson appeared poised to complete the kill. However, sophomore defenseman Viktor Dombrovskiy fanned on his attempted clear, enabling Bobcat forward Luke Shiplo to fire the go-ahead goal from the slot just seconds later.
Quinnipiac’s 3-2 edge would stand the rest of the way—that is, until a diving empty-netter from senior forward Tommy Schutt doubled the lead in the game’s final minute. The Bobcats still have not lost a regular-season ECAC contest in their own building since December 2014.
“It’s frustrating; I thought we played well,” Donato said. “Obviously we carried the play for most of the night. We made a couple mistakes; they end up in the back of our net.”
Quinnipiac opened the scoring a little over a minute into the first period. After senior Sean Malone was whistled for a hold just 19 seconds after puck drop, freshman defenseman Brogan Rafferty’s blast from the point beat a screened Madsen glove-side. The power-play goal was the first of two for the Bobcats—interestingly, three Quinnipiac defensemen were on the ice for the first conversion, while four forwards helped produce the second one.
Moments later, things nearly went from bad to worse for Harvard, as junior Landon Smith and Shiplo embarked on an effective 2-on-0 reminiscent of a typical Bobcat chance from the Crimson’s infamous first-period meltdown at Madison Square Garden in January.
Yet, Harvard survived the defensive lapse and settled in rather quickly. Dombrovskiy equalized with his second goal of the weekend at 8:26 in the period, ripping a trailing pass from senior Tyler Moy past junior goaltender Chris Truehl from the slot.
Then atoning for his costly play in the opening minute of period one, Malone made amends in the opening minute of period two. The second-line center slipped his own rebound past Truehl 24 seconds into the middle frame to put the Crimson up, 2-1.
But ultimately, the mistakes that followed proved too costly for the icemen from Cambridge. After the game, Donato said he felt Quinnipiac made big saves, while his side did not. Furthermore, when asked about the nine penalties the Crimson racked up, his response concluded with, “It’s hard to score from the penalty box.”
Another thing Donato felt his side could have done much better was execute on the power play. While Harvard took nine penalties, so did the hosts. But while each team received five power plays, the Bobcats converted two of them, and the Crimson came up empty on all five.
Harvard’s last power-play opportunity arose with 2:44 remaining. In pursuit of the equalizer, the Crimson skated 6-on-4 for the final 36 seconds of the man advantage, but Truehl (30 saves) would not be beaten again. Twenty seconds following the penalty’s expiration, Schutt buried his empty-netter to wrap things up.
“Harvard’s a great team—that’s a top 10 team,” Quinnipiac coach Rand Pecknold said. “But good teams find ways to win.”
GAME NOTES
— After the game, Donato indicated that he was upset early on because he thought there were "some targeted head shots out there." One of them led Donato to become visibly animated midway through the second period, as Bobcat captain Connor Clifton laid a high hit on Harvard co-captain Alexander Kerfoot—a play that led to penalties against both sides (Kerfoot for retaliation).
"I don’t really see much a place for it in the game and didn’t think it was handled all that well," Donato said, speaking generally about the perceived head shots. "That’s something that we’ll address with the people we need to address it with."
— Freshman Frederic Gregoire and sophomore Michael Floodstrand made their season debuts on the fourth line.
"We wanted to see what we have," Donato said. "It’s still early here, and those guys have performed very well in practice. I think we’re still in the learning and evaluation stage."
— Harvard won the shots on goal count, 32-21, on the night. In total, the Crimson had 65 shot attempts to Quinnipiac's 39.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s basketball team (0-1) was on the road this weekend for its first game of the season, taking on the Minnesota Golden Gophers (1-0).
The Crimson suffered its first loss of the season, 87-103, extending its losing streak from last season to four straight games. It showed early and often that Harvard will have to go through growing pains before it hopes to challenge quality opponents.
“Not good enough to win, unfortunately,” head coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “[I’m] disappointed because I think it was a winnable game.”
The Crimson started three underclassmen with three more coming off the bench. However, one should be hesitant to say that the loss was due to young players, considering many of the sophomores on this year’s squad either started or played quality minutes in last year’s season.
“You expect when you play and start the players that play here who are so young, you expect some transition and some of those mistakes. In that sense, it’s a great start,” Delaney-Smith said. “[However], if we didn’t have the ability or the depth that would be one thing, but that’s not the case.”
The two biggest problems for Harvard were turnovers and fouls. Harvard turned the ball over 22 times compared to Minnesota’s nine turnovers, as well as sending the Golden Gophers to the line for 27 free throw attempts while the Crimson only had three during the contest. Getting away from fundamental basketball contributed to Harvard not taking care of the ball, and underperforming on the defensive end of the court.
“I think we made little mistakes like not checking our passes, and little to no ball fakes,” captain Destiny Nunley said. “Defensively sending a team to the line a lot during the course of a game really messes up the flow. It stops the game, it stops the run, and once we figure that out we can control the pace of the game.”
Minnesota’s Carlie Wagner controlled the pace as she lead her team to victory with 27 points. Wagner also collected two offensive rebounds, and grabbed two steals starting at the point guard position.
“She was a very good player. A couple times she hit a three with a hand in her face,” Nunley said about the Minnesota native.
Despite the Crimson’s shortcomings, there were signs that this squad has the potential to be dangerous later in the season. Harvard hit sixteen three-pointers in Saturday’s match-up, the fourth time in program history and first time since 1998.
The strong shooting from beyond the arc came as no surprise to the players or the coaching staff.
“It’s by design. We think we have incredible inside game. Destiny is a very athletic player who can be effective inside, Jeannie is freshman who proved tonight how good she can be inside,” Delaney-Smith said. “We think we can be very powerful and athletic inside, and we want to put a bunch of three-point shooters around them.”
Sophomore guard Madeline Raster lead the team in three-pointers, making six three-pointers during the contest. The South Bend native would be crucial in keeping Harvard in the game, playing with poise and confidence.
“She just kept on shooting. She hit two really early and after that she struggled a little bit behind the 3-point line,” Nunley said. “Her maturity definitely showed in this game because last year she would have stopped shooting. I think her confidence was vibrant in this game.”
Another young player that unsurprisingly played with maturity was freshman forward Jeannie Boehm. The McDonald’s All-American showed that she is ready for the collegiate basketball stage.
Boehm scored 15 points, blocked three shots, and grabbed four boards for the Crimson despite the experienced front court of Minnesota.
“I thought it was a breakout game for her,” Delaney Smith said. “I think it’s going to go a long way for her taking a giant step forward.”
Despite late runs by Harvard in the fourth quarter it was unable to close the huge gap that Wagner and the rest of the Golden Gophers created going into the last minutes of the game. Saturday’s contest proved to be a little much for the still maturing team, but showed glimpses of what the Crimson is capable of this season.
“This was a winnable game. We made some errors, especially at the start of the second half,”  Delaney Smith said. “There was some decision making that was bad, and we went down from five to six to down by fifteen, in a matter of seconds. We have to fix that decision making. I think there’s a lot to learn, and I’m optimistic that we can fix it.”
Harvard will have a chance to prove if it found the solution this coming Tuesday as the team faces off against the Maine Black Bears at home, a team they have lost to their past two contests.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In windy and near freezing conditions, the Harvard-Radcliffe rowing team successfully capped off its fall season at the annual Foot of the Charles.  Unlike the much more celebrated Head of the Charles Regatta, this race features a longer portion of the Charles River—six kilometers running from the MIT boathouse to the Head of the Charles finish line—and is specifically for collegiate teams.
The Foot of the Charles is also unique in that both lightweight and heavyweight crews compete in the same categories, allowing the different boats to scrimmage each other while stacking up against some of their fiercest opponents.
Both divisions of the Black and White placed in top-10 positions in the premier Varsity Eight event, finishing their respective fall seasons on a fairly high note.
Radcliffe Varsity Lightweights
The lightweight varsity eight finished in eighth place, with a time of 21:34, falling short of its third place performance last year.  While this result was not ideal, the only lightweight team that Radcliffe fell to was BU. Coming off a major victory over the Terriers at the Head of the Charles, the Black and White considered its result disappointing but not entirely indicative of its ability.
“The beauty is that if it’s windy for one boat, it’s windy for all of the boats. The game becomes who can let the weather affect them the least,” sophomore Julia Davis said. “I think that we managed the conditions pretty well and put up the best possible fight.”
The second varsity eight boat placed 20th in the same event, finishing behind only Dartmouth’s heavyweight fourth varsity eight boat.
In the Open Four event, Radcliffe’s lightweight varsity eight placed fourth with a time of 17:46, falling to Northeastern, MIT and BC heavyweight boats.  However, the crew bested the MIT lightweight boat by 7.6 seconds.
While the close to their season was not phenomenal, the lightweight boats enthusiastically look forward to the spring—the squad’s championship-racing season.
“In head races, you can’t necessarily tell what the other boats are doing around you,” Davis said.  “In the spring, the trick is to keep rowing like the other team is always making a move.”
Radcliffe Varsity Heavyweights
Despite the harsh weather, the Radcliffe varsity eight prevailed, placing first. Contending in a field of 21 boats that represented Dartmouth, Northeastern, Boston University, and MIT, the Black and White improved upon its 6th place finish at last year’s Foot of the Charles.
“The team has worked hard this fall, and this race is a great opportunity to finish off the fall season, like another go at racing the Head of the Charles but a bit longer”, said sophomore Rafaela Stalph, who sat three seat in the varsity eight. “We managed to overtake Dartmouth fairly early on, within the first 1500 [Meters], and kept pushing away from there.”
With a time of 20:29, the eight developed a massive lead over runner-up boat Northeastern, pulling away to a whopping 19-second margin over the local rival.  Similarly, the second varsity eight earned a respectable ninth-place finish in the same event with a time of 21:35.
In the Novice Eight event, Radcliffe fielded only one boat in this slightly smaller category, ultimately earning an eighth place finish. The Novice event featured an abridged version of the course, making it more of a sprint than an endurance race.  The Huskies were the victors, putting up a time of 13:39, roughly a minute and a half over the Black and White.
“I think we learned that we need to maintain connection [in the stroke] off the front and drive through the legs, allowing the boat to surge forward, even when you are tired in the second half of the race,” said Stalph. “Over the winter, we'll keep working on our base fitness and building strength up until our Florida training trip.  Building that base is important to be able to sustain speed during the dual races in the spring.”

A little under nine months ago, the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team missed out on an Ancient Eight title, falling to Princeton by just 21.5 points at the Ivy League Championship. This year, the Crimson’s biggest goal is to erase the memory of that loss by recapturing top marks in the conference.
Harvard (2-0, 2-0 Ivy) took a decisive first step towards that objective on Friday with a pair of wins over league rivals Dartmouth (0-2, 0-2) and Cornell (1-1, 1-1) in Hanover, N.H. The Crimson knocked off both opponents by a score of 198-96, breaking six pool records along the way.
“The team really stepped up and made a statement to the rest of the Ivy League,” senior Aly Abdel Khalik said. “After losing Ivies last year by such a narrow margin, we came into this season with a lot of motivation. Some of the times posted today were the fastest I have seen in dual meets in my time at Harvard so far, so that is definitely a good sign for the rest of the season.”
Harvard secured the win in dominant fashion, taking top marks in 13 of 16 events and placing at least two athletes on the podium in all but four events. The victory was highlighted by three consecutive races, the 100 freestyle, 200 backstroke, and 200 breaststroke, in which the Crimson swept the top three spots.
In the 200 back, junior Koya Osada touched the wall first with a commanding lead, almost five seconds in front of senior Jack Manchester and co-captain Mitchell Foster, who finished the race in a dead heat to tie for second.
Harvard would not have to wait long for its next podium sweep. In the next event, two Crimson swimmers broke a four-year-old pool record and a third came close, taking the top three places along the way.
Freshman Daniel Chang led the way with a time of 1:59.97, while co-captain Eric Ronda finished close behind in 2:00.53. Junior Shane McNamara rounded out the podium in third. Both Chang and Ronda’s results topped the former pool-best mark of 2:01.17.
Earlier, freshman Dean Farris broke another pool record and added to the run of strong results by Crimson first-years, capturing a win in the 100 free. Juniors Ed Kim and Steven Tan ended up second and third, respectively, to complete Harvard’s final podium sweep of the day.
The Crimson freshmen would continue to impress throughout the meet. First-year Zach Snyder picked up two wins on his Harvard debut, capturing top marks in the 200 and 500 freestyle events. Farris chipped in a second solo victory in the 100 butterfly, and broke yet another pool record in an exhibition heat in the final event of the day, the 400 free relay. Kim, Tan, and senior Max Yakubovich formed the other three legs of the relay team, which was the first group to break the three-minute mark in the event at Karl Michael Pool.
“I think it is safe to say the whole team is super excited to have [the freshmen] on board,” Foster said. “They have brought an electricity to this team that is extremely unique. Their contributions in the pool and on the boards were exactly what this team needed today.”
The Crimson’s upperclassmen contributed to team’s success as well, spearheaded by three wins from Osada. In addition to his victory in the 200 back, the Chapel Hill, N.C. native picked up first-place finishes in the 100 back and the 200 medley relay. Tan, McNamara, and senior Paul O’Hara made up the rest of the winning medley lineup.
Senior Sava Turcanu also collected a win, touching the wall half a second ahead of Cornell junior Vincent Declerq in the 200 butterfly.
Harvard’s divers had a significant and equally dominant part to play in securing the result, as they established momentum early for the Crimson. In the opening event of the meet, the three-meter dive, juniors Bobby Ross and David Pfeifer finished first and second, while freshman Austin Fields ended up fourth in his first competition for Harvard.
Later in the day, the finishing positions would be flipped but the result would be the same in the one-meter event, as Pfeifer took top marks, Fields picked up second place, and Ross came in fourth.
With the first victory of the season under its belt, the Crimson is already looking ahead.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, the Harvard women’s volleyball team played its sixth and final conference weekend doubleheader.
This weekend also happened to be its first sweep of the competition.
Taking on both Yale on Friday and Brown on Saturday in the Malkin Athletic Center, the Crimson  (8-14, 7-7 Ivy League) emerged victorious. In two five set matches and scores of 3-2, Harvard ended the season with a fourth place finish among Ancient Eight.
HARVARD 3, BROWN 2
Brown (5-19, 3-11) came into the matchup seventh in the Ancient Eight rankings, ahead of only Dartmouth. Despite the Bears’ strong performance at the net—racking up 13 blocks to Harvard’s eight—the team would falter as the Crimson cruised through the final set.
Harvard started off the night with a key 25-21 victory, capitalizing on the Bears’ nine errors throughout the set. It was McCarthy who finished the set with a service ace. While the second set fell to the Brown, the Crimson kept close, pulling to within two before a 6-1 run granted the Bears the 25-18 victory.
While the third set was tied at 17 apiece at one point, the final portion of the game was marred by Brown errors: one to give Harvard the lead—a gap the Bears never closed—and a service error to close the game in favor of the Crimson.
The fourth set went Brown’s way after a 20-20 tie was followed by four straight Bear points and a 25-23 Brown win.
“Brown is a slower system [than Yale] so it took us a while to get adjusted,” Harvard coach Jennifer Weiss said. “I was really proud of the way we could do that both matches.“
In the final set of the match, Harvard maintained a lead throughout through an offensive dominance that tallied a team total of ten kills and only one error. The final point was brought home with a kill by co-captain setter Corie Bain in the final game of her career.
Bain recorded her 32nd career triple double and eighth of the season with 14 kills, 23 assists and 14 digs. Bain ended her career as the Harvard record holder for triple doubles, double doubles, and single season aces. She ranks second for career aces and sixth for career assists. Overall, the setter has earned 14 Ivy League awards.
“Corie is one of the best players that we’ve had,” Weiss said. “She just plays hard and makes us play hard with her, those around her get better. She’ll be greatly missed. She’s definitely left her legacy and has been a wonderful one.”
For the rest of the team, Kebe matched her season high of 15 kills, Burbank recorded 18 kills of her own, supplemented by five digs. Freshman setter Erin McCarthy had 33 assists and 12 digs while Uhr had 19 digs of her own in addition to seven assists.
“I think that our success in this last weekend of Ivy play really represents our ability to get knocked down and come back stronger,” sophomore setter Brooke Istvan said. “We are a young team and have made leaps and bounds from the beginning of the season which looks promising for next year.”
HARVARD 3, YALE 2
Coming into the matchup with two consecutive 3-0 sweeps against Princeton and Penn, the Bulldogs (18-5, 11-3 Ivy) were on a tear for the Ivy League title. This momentum, and aspirations for the title, was put to rest by the Crimson.
“I think all of us agree that our game Friday against Yale was the most fun all season,” Istvan said. “Our team has been forced to face challenge after even more difficult challenge this season. But every time we got knocked down we got back up working and fighting even harder.”
The first set was taken by Harvard in an easy 25-13 victory. The two started off evenly matched and tied at 7-7. A key kill by junior outside hitter Paige Kebe catalyzed a run for the Crimson in which they scored eight of the next nine points. Yale failed to make up the difference. Harvard led the Bulldogs with 14 kills in the set and only two errors while the Yale dealt with seven.
Harvard faltered the next set at 15-15, allowing a 5-0 Yale run. The Crimson brought the score to within reason after three point run left Yale with a one-point lead at 23-22. Two attack errors later, Yale took the set 22-25.
The third set also fell to the Bulldogs 23-25 as Harvard allowed an early 10-2 lead. Again the Crimson would work to pull the score to within one, this time at 23-24, but would ultimately drop the set.
In a set featuring 18 kills and four errors on the part of the Harvard, as opposed to Yale’s 14 and six, respectively, the Crimson tallied a 26-24 win.
The team capped a come-from-behind victory with a comeback in the final set. Trailing 10-7, Harvard went on a 6-1 run, effectively building a two-point lead. This would prove too much for the Bulldogs to overcome as Harvard took the set and match with the 15-13 win.
On the night, freshman outside hitter Grace Roberts Burbank led the team and recorded her career high 26 kills, accompanied by seven digs. In blocks, freshman middle blocker Maclaine Fields and sophomore middle blocker Christina Cornelius tallied six blocks a piece while sophomore outside hitter Anna Uhr posted 22 digs.
“I think we prepared well during the week, coming into this weekend,” Weiss said. “We knew what had to do against each team it was just a matter of keeping to the game plan and executing what we wanted to do defensively.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard wrestling debuted its 2016-2017 squad this Sunday, kicking off individual competition season with the Jonathan Calhoust Bearcat Open. Four Crimson athletes wrestled into the semifinal round, with junior Josef Johnson making an appearance in the final.
“That was our first time out this year,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said. “So I take this as almost a practice, something we’re going to get better from. I’m happy with some, I’m disappointed with others. But, it’s early and this is what we’ve got to do to go back and get better.”
For three of the Crimson’s top performers, the season opener was also their career opener. The freshman trio of Kyle Bierdumpfel, Hunter Ladnier, and A.J. Jaffe all finished the day with a top-ten finish.
“We haven’t had a group of freshmen like this in a long time,” Weiss said. “They all had a great tournament this weekend.”
Bierdumpfel, Ladnier, and Jaffe each recorded decisive victories over their opponents at the Open. At 165, Bierdumpfel fought his way back through consolation rounds to finish the day in sixth place. Meanwhile, Ladnier and Jaffe, at 149 and 141, each picked up five wins, claiming the fifth place spot in their weight classes.
“Hunter, Alex and Kyle were absolutely relentless,” said junior co-captain Josef Johnson. “From the day these freshmen arrived on campus, they have worked so hard for the program, and I really think that was reflected in most of their matches today.”
Senior Nick Gajdzik also put up a strong performance for the Crimson. The heavyweight notched two dramatic victories, outmaneuvering his first opponent to earn a major decision and winning by fall in his second contest. Gajdzik kept this momentum in his final match, pinning his opponent to clinch fifth place.
“I think that compared to last year, Nick opened up a lot more and was more willing to be aggressive on the mat,” Johnson said. “He was constantly looking to score.”
Johnson was the Crimson’s top finisher of the day, wrestling in the championship match in the 174 weight class. The junior recorded two takedowns and a pin en route to the final, and ultimately was outmaneuvered in his final bout of the day against Penn State’s Mark Hall.
“I thought it was really good for him to get in the finals,” Weiss said. “He wrestled a junior world champion, this guy is one of the top in the country in his class. It was a close match, down to two periods, and it got a little out of hand in the third. But I think that’s going to help him understand what he needs to do going forward.”
While the team was plagued by injuries last year in the lightweight divisions, this year set a different tone for the position. Sophomore Matthew Rodriguez and Ryan Friedman each notched wins for the Crimson, although they did not place in the top ten.
“For both of them, it was their first college tournament,” Weiss said. “They’re fighting, and they’re doing well. I’m very pleased with both of them.”

In its season opener, Harvard women’s swimming and diving crushed rivals Dartmouth and Cornell, beating the former 203-89 and the latter 198-94. The domination was apparent on the board, in the individual events, and in the relays, with the Crimson taking gold in the first nine swim events.
Divers junior Jing Leung and sophomore Mikaela Thompson led Harvard in both the thre- and one-meter competitions. Leung took first in the three-meter, with Thompson trailing by 0.35 points; both were ahead of the next competitor by a staggering 41 points. In the one-meter, the sophomore took gold, and Leung claimed third.
The Crimson continued to show strength in the pool as well, with first-place finishes from veterans and rookies alike. Junior Reagan Kology held down the distance squad, coming in third in the 1000 freestyle behind senior Willa Wang, who took first. In addition, Kology touched the wall in 5:01.46—good for gold in the 500 free, edging out Dartmouth’s AnnClaire MacArt by less than a second.
The junior class dominated in the shorter events as well, with Geordie Enoch taking first in the 100 breast. Classmate Kristina Li also had an impressive showing, earning the gold in both the 100 and 200 back. Li also participated in the relay team that took first in the 200 IM, just ahead of two other Harvard quads to take the sweep.
Harvard’s freshmen held their own as well, with golds from Jerrica Li in the 100 free and Miki Dahlke in the 100 fly. Fellow freshman Mei Lynn Colby took second in the same event, touching the wall in 57.15.
Other noteworthy performances included sophomore Brittany Usinger, who earned a first-place finish in the 200 fly. Her time of 2:03.48 beat Cornell freshman Jordan Silbert by nearly four seconds. Usinger also swam the second leg of the 200 IM relay, participating in the silver-medaling team.
After a successful season opener, the team looks forward to upcoming invitationals at Texas and Georgia.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend the Harvard men’s crew team competed in its final regatta of the season on its home course here at the Charles River. After a varied performance across the board at the Head of the Charles, the Foot of the Charles Regatta gave the team one last chance to get race experience on the water before the start of winter training and the spring season.
“We love a chance to get behind the handle and race,” sophomore Benjamin Cohen said.
Competing against other Boston-area schools on Sunday, the Crimson had a strong showing in the varsity four race. Harvard’s heavyweight first boat claimed second place with a time of 13:04, beating out Brown’s first boat by just two seconds. Harvard fell to first place Northeastern by six seconds.
Harvard’s fourth boat came in fourth place with a time of 13:09.9, surpassing the Crimson’s fifth boat, which came in fifth with 13:13.4.
There wasn’t a separate race for the lightweight team, so both teams competed together this weekend. The lightweight first boat came in 12th with a time of 13:31.5, less than a second faster than the BU boat that took 13th. Of the 12 Crimson boats that competed, eight boats placed in the top 20.
In the varsity eight race, the Crimson’s freshman boat finished third overall and first for Harvard with a time of 12:38.5. The freshman boat fell to Brown by just 0.4 seconds, and Northeastern again took first place.
Harvard’s heavyweight second boat took eighth place with 13:12.9, while the lightweight second boat and first boat claimed ninth and 10th place, respectively.
Harvard also entered two boats in the novice race, coming in second and third place of the three boats racing, while Boston College claimed first place.
“As a team we didn’t have our best performance, but we have a really deep squad,” Cohen said. “We’re excited as a group to gear up to face Yale and the rest of the league this spring.”
The team will have over four months of training until its first race of the spring season in April.

This year, the Crimson’s biggest goal is to erase the memory of that loss by recapturing top marks in the conference.
Harvard (2-0, 2-0 Ivy) took a decisive first step towards that objective on Friday with a pair of wins over league rivals Dartmouth (0-2, 0-2) and Cornell (1-1, 1-1) in Hanover, N.H. The Crimson knocked off both opponents by a score of 198-96, breaking six pool records along the way.

Harvard secured the win in dominant fashion, taking top marks in 13 of 16 events and placing at least two athletes on the podium in all but four events. The victory was highlighted by three consecutive races, the 100 freestyle, 200 backstroke, and 200 breaststroke, in which the Crimson swept the top three spots.

Harvard would not have to wait long for its next podium sweep. In the next event, two Crimson swimmers broke a four-year-old pool record and a third came close, taking the top three places along the way.
Freshman Daniel Chang led the way with a time of 1:59.97, while co-captain Eric Ronda finished close behind in 2:00.53. Junior Shane McNamara rounded out the podium in third. Both Chang and Ronda’s results topped the former pool-best mark of 2:01.17.
Earlier, freshman Dean Farris broke another pool record and added to the run of strong results by Crimson first-years, capturing a win in the 100 free. Juniors Ed Kim and Steven Tan ended up second and third, respectively, to complete Harvard’s final podium sweep of the day.
The Crimson freshmen would continue to impress throughout the meet. First-year Zach Snyder picked up two wins on his Harvard debut, capturing top marks in the 200 and 500 freestyle events. Farris chipped in a second solo victory in the 100 butterfly and broke yet another pool record in an exhibition heat in the final event of the day, the 400 free relay. Kim, Tan, and senior Max Yakubovich formed the other three legs of the relay team, which was the first group to break the three-minute mark in the event at Karl Michael Pool.

“This result sets us up well for the rest of the season,” Khalik said. “At this point in the season it is easy to get overconfident, so we just need to make sure that we avoid complacency and continue challenging ourselves day in and day out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its penultimate weekend of racing in the 2016 fall season, the Harvard sailing team was unable to continue its recent streak of successes. The group faltered in its quest to claim glory in its two regional championships.
The women’s and co-ed squads earned similarly middling results, finishing ninth and 13th, respectively. All weekend the teams fought through testy-yet-varied racing conditions.
“We didn't have the strongest season this fall, but I think we did a good job taking advantage of the opportunities we had,” sophomore skipper Nicholas Karnovsky said. “We have a young team and definitely made some major strides by the end of the season, as everyone stepped up their game. I think we have a strong future in store.”
WOMEN’S ATLANTIC COAST CHAMPIONSHIP
Racing in Charleston, S.C. to compete for the regional championship trophy in Z420s, the Crimson failed to capitalize on some of its early successes. Contending against eighteen other schools in the region, Harvard finished in the top half of the event with its ninth-place, 318-point result.
“We're very proud of how far we've come this season as a women's team,” junior skipper Taylor Ladd said. “We have learned a lot and put up some really great results. This weekend was no exception, and we're feeling proud of our performance but also excited for next season to show we can do even better.”
Harvard fared better in the shiftier conditions that were present in the early races. But the team could not continue its solid showing as the breeze steadied to a brisk 10 to 18 knots and as the Charleston current performed its daily shift.
Sophomore skipper Taylor Gavula and senior crew Emma Wheeler started off strong in the B-Division, as they led the division at the regatta’s midpoint after three first-place finishes in individual events. But the duo’s luck ran out on the second day of racing, as the pair continued to slide down the leaderboard on Sunday after posting comparatively meager results. Gavula and Wheeler finished the weekend in eighth place in the division after tallying 158 total points.
In the A-Division, Harvard was unable to replicate its fourth-place finish in the Victorian Coffee Urn regatta that helped propel the squad to the championship just two weeks ago. This time the program’s 160 points were only good enough for an eighth-place divisional result.
In the first six races of the weekend, the veteran duo of Ladd and junior crew Kristin Anderson finished mostly with middling results. A second-place finish in their second race helped the pairing to seventh place overall after the first six races had been completed. Freshman Lucy Wilmot replaced Ladd as the boat’s skipper for the four remaining Saturday races after Ladd could not continue due to illness. Ladd returned on Sunday, and the boat performed increasingly well as the day wore on.
Coast Guard, Boston College, and the University of Rhode Island all made the podium with their respective 179-, 216-, and 239-point performances.
ATLANTIC COAST CHAMPIONSHIP
As the co-ed racing was hosted by MIT on the Charles River Basin, this Crimson contingent was not required to travel as far for its event. But the limited travel provided no advantage for the co-ed team over the women’s squad, as the former placed 13th after a 361-point performance.
Wind conditions posed a challenge for all of the competitors, as the five- to 12-knot breeze continually progressed westward throughout the racing. However, Harvard fared better as the regatta wore on, displaying its ability to adjust to a changing environment.
“The conditions on the river were particularly challenging this weekend, and the competition was incredibly strong,” Karnovsky said. “While we weren't able to come away with the result we were looking for, we now have a very clear picture of what we need to get better at this spring.”
Junior co-captain and skipper Nick Sertl and sophomore crew Christine Gosioco led the way for the Crimson in the event after tallying 161 points over their 18 races, which was good enough for ninth place in the A-Division.  The pairing closed out the regatta strongly after struggling in the earlier races of the weekend, finishing in the top half of seven on its final ten races.
In the B-Division, Karnovsky, sophomore skipper Jackson Wagner, sophomore crew Alejandra Resendiz, and senior crew Julia Lord combined to produce a 12th-place finish. While Harvard’s 200-point performances was similar to that of 13th-place George Washington University, the Crimson came out on top as a result of a head-to-head tiebreaker.
Host MIT claimed victory in the eighteen-school field with 245 points. Tufts and the College of Charleston were not far behind after tallying 256 and 267 points, respectively.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Playing a pair of ranked opponents for the second weekend in a row, the Harvard women’s ice hockey team returned to Bright-Landry to take on No. 10/RV Princeton (4-3-1, 2-3-1 ECAC) and No. 8/8 Quinnipiac (9-4-1, 4-2-0)
Despite taking the lead against both teams early on, the Crimson (1-4-0, 1-4-0) was unable to hold onto its leads, falling by a 2-1 margin to both opponents to extend the team’s losing streak to four games.
QUINNIPIAC 2, HARVARD 1
With the Bobcats offense firing on all cylinders, a checking penalty by sophomore defender Kaitlin Tse along the boards gave Quinnipiac a power play opportunity just over five minutes into the final stanza.
Thirty seconds later, senior Emma Woods sent the puck across the face of goal to junior Taylar Cianfarano, who was parked right next to the far post. Harvard netminder Brianna Laing, who dived in an attempt to nab the puck, was unable to keep her balance as Cianfarano fired into the net to give the Bobcats a 2-1 lead. The scoreline proved to be final as Quinnipiac kept Harvard off the scoreboard for the remainder of the period.
“It was a hard-fought game and we ended up playing alot of defense.” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “We came out of the gates pretty strong and had some good momentum and then we ended up having to play quite a bit of defense and that’s tough. [Quinnipiac] is a very seasoned team and they’re tough.”
After two scoreless periods to start the game that saw the Bobcats outshoot the Crimson by a 23-8 margin, it was Harvard that took an early lead through freshman forward Val Turgeon. Streaking down the left hand side on the counterattack, the rookie fired a shot glove side into the net for her second goal of the season.
The Bobcats, whose offense had been largely sloppy up to that point, sparked to live and immediately began to pepper Laing with shots. Quinnipiac finally broke through just two minutes after Turgeon’s shot as freshman Kati Tabin’s rifle from the point made its way top-shelf.
The goal set up Cianfarano to be the hero for the Bobcats, while the Crimson were left to lament their second lost lead in the span of less than 24 hours.
The loss wrapped up a span of four consecutive games against four ranked opponents. While the Crimson was unable to claim any points during that stretch, the team insists early exposure to difficult opponents can only help the team.
“We learned so much and about our teammates the past four games.” Daniels said. “Obviously it hurts walking away without the Ws but we’re excited for the opportunity to meet these teams down the road.”
PRINCETON 2, HARVARD 1 (OT)
Just over a minute into the extra stanza, Princeton freshman Julia Edgar’s shot from the point found the back of the net to give the Tigers an overtime victory over Harvard. The defender’s shot rebounded off a Crimson stick, leaving senior netminder Molly Tissenbaum stranded as the puck looped over her and into the net.
While the team struggled against a powerful Princeton attack that outshout Harvard, 50-21, it exhibited a marked improvement from its earlier performances.
“I think we’re a better team than we were two weeks ago,” Stone said. “We’ve just got to keep our heads up and not get discouraged cause it’s a long hockey season.”
Co-captain Sydney Daniels opened up the scoring after a 0-0 first period as the senior took control of the puck just outside the crease following a shot by junior forward Lexie Laing before firing past Tiger netminder Alysia Dasilva for her fourth goal of the season.
Despite falling behind, Princeton continued to test Tissenbaum, who would end up registering a career-high 50 saves in goal. Along with Tissenbaum’s heroics, the Tigers were no doubt left frustrated with their power play as the team ended up failing to convert eight penalty opportunities.
Princeton finally evened up the game with just over eight minutes left as senior Morgan Sly collected the puck along the boards before sending a pass into the slot for classmate Cassidy Tucker. The senior fired it home to get the Tigers on the scoresheet and force the extra period.
“I think that after we score we get a little too excited and forget about our gameplan.” Laing said. “We just have to stick to our gameplan all game and after we score, after we let in a goal, nothing has to change.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Making history again this season, the Harvard women’s cross country team is headed to the NCAA National Championships for the first time since 2012.
After securing their first Heps title since 1985, the Crimson carried the momentum from their historic Ivy Championship victory to finish second at the NCAA Northeast Regional Championships, its highest ever finish.
Competing in a deep field of the 40 top teams from across the Northeast, Harvard placed each of its five runners in the top 26 of the race. Leading the pack was junior standout Courtney Smith, finishing second overall with a time of 20:13.90 at the rigorous Van Cortlandt Park in New York City.
“I’m really proud of this team for not wanting things to be easy or getting discouraged when it’s hard but for working hard and enjoying the every day regardless of results so that we can be so happy when we achieve great things,” Smith said.
Following Smith, freshman Judy Pendergast finished in sixth place overall with a time of 20:38.00 and was the fastest freshman at the race, continuing a stellar season for the rookie.
Though eventual winner Providence College was able to slot its number two through five runners—the scoring contingent in cross country—before the Crimson’s third runner, Harvard was able to get all of its top-ive within he top-26.
Freshman Erin Dietz was 17th with a time of 20:57, followed by junior Elianna Shwayder in 20th with a mark of 21:08.30 and classmate Lisa Tertsch, who clocked in with a time of 21:14, in 26th
Throughout the season, the closeness of Harvard’s top runners have helped them push and pace each other. This weekend was no different, as the team was able to put together a spread of just over a minute between the first and fifth finishers. Only Providece posted a better spread.
“When Erin starts to make some good moves and I am sure to cover those moves. I have to be aware that they are happening and that it is crucial for me to run with her,” Shwayder said. “She helps put us in great positioning.”
Strong performances from all five Crimson women, helped the team secure second place overall as a team, again out running all of its Ivy rivals.
Harvard and Providence, who are currently ranked 3rd in the country by the U.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association poll, will automatically represent the east coast at the NCAA National Championships as the top two regional women’s teams.
On the men’s side, sophomore Kieran Tuntivate was the sole representative for the Crimson. Tuntivate ran a historic race for Harvard, finishing 23rd with a time of 31:16.40, the best finish by a Harvard sophomore since 2008.
For finishing in the top-25 at the NCAA Northeast Regional Championships, Smith, Pendergast, Dietz, Shwayder, and Tuntivate will all receive USTFCCCA All-Region honors.
“I think the reason qualifying for nationals feels so rewarding for this team is the patience. It’s the product of many weeks, months and evens years of commitment, doing things right, caring about each other and enjoying the process” Smith said. “ I think the harder it is to achieve something, the more you have to put in to achieve it, but the happier you are when you do.”
Currently ranked 18th according to the USTFCCCA, on November 19th, the Harvard women’s team will head Terre Haute, Indiana to compete on the LaVern Gibson Championship Cross Country Course at the NCAA National Championship.

Friday, in front of a almost packed lecture hall, the four tickets running for president and vice-president of the Undergraduate Council exchanged questions and the occasional jabs over the course of an hour at the Crimson's annual Crossfire debate.. While the debate lacked the fire and brimstone that many had hoped for, it nonetheless provided some lessons that our own feckless politicians should take note of.
First and foremost, our politicians could learn that the way to solve the partisan divide is to all have the exact same views on every single issue. Sure enough, whether the question concerned final clubs, the HUDS strike, or ridiculously rising textbook costs, the UC candidates all gave more or less the same response. We had an uncanny flashback to Marco Rubio’s machine-meltdown in the last debate before the New Hampshire primary (wow, that seems like ages ago.) If politicians in Washington wanted to solve bitter partisan divide, they could follow suit, giving the same answers and just convincing as many of their friends as possible to vote for them.
And you know what? Politicians should realize that it’s okay to be a little weird. In years past, the UC presidential has generally included one joke ticket, often consisting of athletes. Last year, one of these tickets began an impromptu game of “beer-pong” during the crossfire debates, providing much needed comedic relief. Given this trend, major props must be given to Grant S. Solomon '18 and Alexander T. Moore '18. Although many expected little out of them when they came in wearing t-shirts with “Harambe” emblazoned across the front, they fared well amongst their better-dressed peers. Perhaps if we had more lawmakers in Washington who weren’t afraid to get weird (yes, we’re explicitly asking our government’s leaders to wear Harambe shirts), Congress might actually get something done once in awhile.
Best of luck to all the candidates and remember to vote!
