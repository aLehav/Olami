Putting on a play is never an easy feat. The weeks leading up to the performance often involve hours of rehearsals, careful decisions about lighting, sound, and costumes, not to mention coping with stage fright. Just imagine embarking on this formidable process, but in a language that you’re still learning, and where your final performance is graded! And yet the students of one German course at Harvard are attempting just that. German 65’s production of “(R)evolution,” a German-language play by Yael Ronen and Dimitrij Schaad, is set to premiere with performances on May 2 and 3 at 7:30 pm in Sackler Room 113.
A major part of German 65: German Drama and Theater’s appeal is its instructor. In this course, Professor Lisa Parkes combines the roles of dedicated director and conscientious German instructor, offering a guiding hand during the rehearsal process, correcting students’ pronunciation, and even stepping in as an actor when necessary. Indeed, many students cite her reputation as one of the primary reasons for enrolling in German 65. “Last semester I took a class with Professor Parkes and I thought she was great at explaining German and making sure we understood everything,” Paula Leyes ’24 said.
All third-year German language courses have a unique theme, and Professor Parkes hoped to use this one to instill admiration for German literature through close study. For Parkes, however, reading German plays was not enough — she wanted students to delve deeper into the content in a way that engaged all aspects of language learning.
“Reading and discussing dramatic texts only take you so far; performing pushes you to read between the lines, engaging linguistic, interpersonal, creative, and interpretive skills,” Parkes said. Engagement is a crucial part of the course, and it was actually students who chose the play they wanted to perform from an array of dramas studied at the beginning of the semester. Ultimately, they settled on “(R)evolution,” a play inspired by the novel “21 Lessons for the 21st Century” by Yuval Noah Harari.
The rest of the production process has been just as collaborative. “Dr. Parkes wants us to be super involved. She’s always looking for our input. We’ve talked about ‘How do we want to do lighting?’ ‘How do we want to get the audience more involved?’ ‘How do we want to approach the presentation of these characters?’” Roderick P. Emley ’24 said.
Parkes’ students have widely different backgrounds in theater. While this production represents just another acting credit in a long list of experiences for some of the class’s performers, many students have never set foot on a stage before, making this theatrical experience all the more special. “Perhaps most remarkable is that some students began learning German here at Harvard just two years ago, and all are novice actors performing for the first time in German,” Parkes said.
For Rosanna K. Kataja ’24, the shared novelty of performing in German is an especially valuable part of the class. “Everybody is on the same level, everybody wants to learn, and nobody is a native speaker or anything. That’s what I like the most. Everyone is on the same level, supporting each other,” she said. This strong sense of camaraderie is clear: While a handful of students rehearse their scenes onstage with Parkes, the rest of the class sits in the adjacent room to run lines, discuss their characters, and occasionally crack a joke or two — all in German, of course.
Given the time-consuming nature of the class, it’s fortunate that the play itself is engaging. Set 20 years in the future, “(R)evolution” depicts a world that has become completely dependent on technology, and where genetic engineering to create “ideal human beings” is not just a theoretical concern, but a real decision facing all prospective parents. But despite the weighty topics, students describe the play as highly entertaining. “It’s sort of the best of both worlds. Funny but at the same time makes you think. To be honest, I think it’s very funny. So be ready to laugh and be ready to enjoy,” Leyes said.
What about those potential audience members who are not fluent in German? “Even if somebody came here and didn’t even speak German that much, they would still get something from it,” Kataja said. Even without knowing German, viewers will still leave the production impressed.

LyLena D. Estabine ’24 fell in love with musical theater at age five, when she was cast in a production of “Fiddler on the Roof.” But it was not until Estabine listened to recordings of the “Hamilton” soundtrack in middle school and thought, “If somebody else could read a book and then write a musical about it then why couldn’t I?” that she was inspired to become a dramatist herself.
Now, Estabine, a published author with experience writing both plays and music, hopes to open the door to performing arts to as many other students as possible while sharing her love of theater and her dedication to her faith.
To that end, she founded a new theater group earlier this year: “The New Songs Theatricals,” whose first production “Painted” will run April 21-23 in the Adams Pool Theater. The musical tells the story of Leonardo DaVinci, a figure that has served as a source of inspiration for Estabine. She hopes DaVinci’s story can be a springboard for discussing social issues.
“What [‘Painted’] is going to do is attempt to start conversations and break down paradigms about the ways in which we discuss Christianity and sexuality, particulary with reference to the LGBTQ community,” she said.
To someone who knows Estabine, this comes as no surprise; she imbues almost every piece she works on with deeper meaning. Her show “Once When the War Was Won,” which she wrote in high school, tells the story of a fictional civil war and the class struggles embedded in the conflict. The virtual show she put on last year, “Dreamland Diner,” was a modern day retelling of the Biblical story of Jacob and Laban that takes place in a 1980s Kansas City diner. And in her more recent work “Milk Made,” an original operetta written in the style of Gilbert and Sullivan, and performed by Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players, she explores a variety of the most pressing issues of today.
“We were able to comment on class struggles once again and specifically what happens when Marxism aligns with environmental justice issues,” she said.
Estabine credits her faith as the source of inspiration for “Dreamland Diner” and “Painted.” “God gave me the words needed to kind of completely revamp the show even up to when we started rehearsals,” she said. The show itself grapples with questions of faith and looks at what it means to be fully and completely loved and known by God. “How does God move in our lives in ways that we might not always see or expect?” she asked. Estabine created New Songs Theatricals in order to provide a “community and space” for artists to discuss and explore the intersections of Christianity and the performing arts, a mission that she plans on continuing with support from other student creators.
Going forward, Estabine plans on being highly involved with theater and productions on campus, and she encourages anyone interested in the performing arts to do the same. She recommends organizations like Harvard Black C.A.S.T. and Harvard College ¡TEATRO!, along with New Songs Theatricals, as great places for aspiring artists on campus to get started.
Estabine is drawn to theater because of its impact. “Art has the power to touch people’s lives in ways that other forms of communication cannot,” she said. In the future, Estabine plans to continue creating community and creating change through the performing arts. For her, it’s ultimately all about connecting with people.
“If you sit down and have a conversation with someone about a difficult topic, oftentimes walls go up,” she said. “But when you sit in a theater or when you read a poem or you listen to a song, walls come down. And I think in our world today especially, we need less walls.”

At only 37 years-old, Jermaine Cole, known professionally as J. Cole, has already accomplished a career's worth: He won a Grammy, headlined 11 nation-wide tours, topped the charts since his very debut with the critical-acclaimed mixtape “The Come Up,” and founded his own label, Dreamville Records. The founder and main headliner of Dreamville Festival, the rapper took the Shine stage on Sunday Apr 3. At various points throughout the hour-long concert, the Fayetteville-native rapper visibly teared up — in apparent awe at the impact he and his festival have made. Not only did his performance prove that he had succeeded in putting North Carolina on the map, it was also a testimony that his town, his Dreamville crew, and his loyal fans will rep ‘Cole world’ until the end.
Cole commented on his rise to fame at various points in his set. “I probably handed out my CDs to some of y’all,” he said, reflecting on his humble beginnings. After performing the song “Too Deep for the Intro” from one of his early mixtapes, 2010’s “Friday Night Lights,” he mentioned that there was a point where he had to contemplate how big he wanted to become, how far-reaching he wanted his music to be.
Now, as one of the most influential rappers of his generation, Cole gets a front-row seat to witness the far-reach of his impact. Dreamville is his record label, his family, his baby. To see 50,000 people flock from all over the nation — all over the world — to support his lifelong vision was a tear-jerking moment indeed. In fact, a fan that could be heard screaming they had traveled 3,000 miles just to see him, which Cole acknowledged with a smirk and retorted: “Were you counting?”
Like a plot line in reverse, the chronology of his set narrated Cole’s complete musical journey for his fans. Cole began his show with “95 south,” “Amari,” and “100 mill” from his latest album, “The Offseason.” These songs mirror the symbolism behind that album: the ambition finally paying off after years of training and honing in his craft. The work doesn’t stop here, but the birds-eye view shows Cole in his element. Then, “A Tale of 2 Citiez” transitioned the narrative to 2014’S “Forest Hills Drive,” which in a sense was the very peak of his career. When Cole’s hustle in producing his best music was gaining nowhere near as much critical recognition as it deserved, and Cole had to be his own biggest supporter. That confidence in his pen game is prevalent in another song from the same album, “Fire Squad,” where Cole criticizes the Grammys for snubbing artists like Kendrick Lamar and Kanye West. In fact, before performing “a lot,” Cole shouted out his “Offseason Tour” co-headliner 21 Savage for helping him win his only Grammy. This point will be reiterated throughout his career: Cole remains the biggest advocate for elevating fellow rappers as royalty — while at the same time proving himself as the king among them.
Going back further in time, “Too Deep for the Intro” from “Friday Night Lights” told the story of a rapper that came from nothing, but believed in himself at a time when no one else did. Cole made sure to pay his dues to his manager Ibrahim “IB” Hamad for grounding him and reminding him to continue to perform earlier songs like these, no matter how many more successful albums he releases after the fact.
Perhaps the fact that he got to bring his chosen family along for the ride informed the emotion of the set. In performing “Shea Butter Baby,” Cole brought out Ari Lennox to the stage, commending her for acing her set earlier that day and sharing with the crowd that Ari Lennox’s first apartment was in Cary, where the festival took place. Bas came out to the mellow beat of “100 Mill.” The rest of the Dreamville gang joined the stage for “Under the Sun” and “Down Bad,” from “Dreamville: Revenge of the Dreamers III” — sans JID who “couldn’t make it,” according to Cole. There were moments when J. Cole stepped back to watch them perform like a proud father admiring his children. Other times saw Cole jumping along to hype them up during their solos. Needless to say, he received all of that energy and love back during his own verses.
Although Cole certainly reveled in the sentimentality of the moment, it didn’t take away from his talent as a seasoned performer. He bantered with the crowd, splitting them into two sections for “Jacky” for the loudest chant of the lyrics “You see the drop-top, bitch, stop playin’ with me.” “I’ve never taken an L before,” he said after betting on the right section to win, teasing the audience into a competitive frenzy. Cole’s audience interaction was not only a sign of his charisma, but also gave insight into his candid — and only a little self-confident — personality. “I got range,” he commented before diving into his verse on Jeremih’s RNB single “Planez.”
Indeed, a discography like Cole’s not only requires range but the perseverance of an iron will. If there was ever a point in his career when he had to contemplate his claim to fame, that time has long passed. After delivering a performance like Dreamville’s, Cole has once again proven that he’s constantly growing and improving — and that there’s no end in sight to what his music can accomplish.

Tracy Deonn has made some of her best decisions while terrified. In a phone interview with The Harvard Crimson, the Coretta Scott King-John Steptoe Award-winning author cites her mother’s parenting style as the guiding light behind some of her boldest — and most successful — choices. Before Deonn’s young adult fantasy novel “Legendborn” debuted on the New York Times Best Sellers list, Deonn’s mother taught her two lasting lessons. First, the ways of the fangirl. “X-Men,” “The Neverending Story,” the original “Doctor Who,” and the Star Wars series of novels and films all instilled a love of the “what if” in Deonn that outlived her childhood and prepared her for playing with form in fiction. Second, Deonn’s mother taught her to overcome fear.
In college, English felt like a natural major for Deonn as a reader and self-described second-generation fangirl. One performance class during her time at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, however, showed her another more daunting yet attractive path. “It was terrifying, but I loved it,” she said. Deonn made the switch to a Communications degree swiftly and without the input of her family. “I think my mother’s parenting style was to make me very, very independent. Even independent of her,” said Deonn.
When Deonn’s mother learned that her daughter had switched majors, she offered encouragement. Years later, however, when Deonn broke the news that she had decided not to go through with the PhD program she had been accepted to at UNC, her mother was more hesitant. “I remember my mother was kind of quiet when I told her, and she rarely wanted to affect my decisions in that way. She did trust me after a while, but she said, ‘I just worry that you're doing that because you're scared of what it means to do a challenging PhD program.’ And I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, that's the opposite. I'm terrified. I have no idea what I'm going to do. I'm really not quite sure what I'm going to be doing, and that is a far more scary thing.’ And I remember she was so relieved.”
For Deonn, going through with the PhD program would have been another five years of her life planned out in front of her. Something in that routine didn’t feel right, and she braved the unknown as her mother had taught her. Instead, the author spent the summer after graduation doing a lot of yoga and exploring San Francisco with a friend. In the fall, she returned to the Chapel Hill campus, where she had secured a job with the professional theater company, PlayMakers Repertory Company, and picked up a teaching job in the Communications Department that she had loved as an undergraduate.
Around this time her mother got sick, and Deonn returned home to help. One year later, her mother passed away. It wasn’t until 10 years later that Deon picked up prose again. “Within a couple weeks of my mom passing away — I didn't write it down at the time — but I remember thinking like, when people you love die, we want to tell a story to ourselves,” she said. “We want to hear a story about why this happened, what happened.”
Deonn knew she would never get answers in real life, but her mind still contemplated the “what ifs.”
“I imagined, what if there was an answer out there? What if there was an explanation for why bad things happen, and what kind of quest would that be? And who would be the person that I imagined would go on such a thing?” she said. “And so I thought of, like, an angry grieving girl, and that was the beginning of Bree.”
Bree Matthews, the central character of “Legendborn,” is a high schooler who sets out to infiltrate an Arthurian society at UNC Chapel Hill when she discovers that her mother’s death may not have been an accident. She shares a name and home state with Brittany “Bree” Newsome Bass, who tore down the Confederate flag of the South Carolina State Capitol after the shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston in 2015. Deonn, another North Carolina native, is surprised no one has mentioned this, though her character is not named after the activist.
Writing about Bree’s identity as the descendant of enslaved people entering a society based on legends and traceable family lines proved difficult for Deonn, especially in the face of a publishing industry that publishes so few young adult fantasy novels about Black women written by Black women. She says part of the reason why BIPOC authors struggle in mining their own authenticity for representative stories is because the industry remains a largely white space, meaning their books end up standing as the sole representative for an entire community. “I think as a writer I need to be able to — I want to be able to — rep my community well, but it isn't possible to represent that whole population,” she said. “All you can do is represent yourself and your own experiences. But that pressure is there and it's hard to juggle.”
Still, she has found readers who thank her for her portrayal of Bree’s journey to understand her past and the ways in which she is changed by her grief. She found this helpful as she wrote the sequel to “Legendborn,” “Bloodmarked,” which is set for publication on Nov. 8, 2022.
“Luckily, I’ve got readers who are amazing and go out of their way to say, like, ‘Of course I want this for this character, or that for Sel, or that for Bree, but I love what you do. And I can’t wait to see what you do with the story,’” Deonn said. “I have a bit of support from my readership to own my gut and just write it how Tracy wants to write it and they’ll go along with me.”
To students and aspiring writers who ask Deonn how she knew she was going to be a writer, she says, “Well, I was a writer when I started writing and then when I decided I enjoyed writing and then when I decided I would write again. That's all you need.”

“The More You Know,” an original musical created by Chloe E.W. Levine ’22 and​​ Ian Chan ’23 that ran from March 31 to April 2 in the Loeb Ex, was written for a Harvard audience. Based on Levine’s own experience of attending a competitive New York City high school and participating in quiz bowl, “The More You Know” is a story of self-worth and discovery that may ring true for some Harvard students.
“We are all complicit by being here in a system that devalues our humanity and teaches us that ‘all you are is what you’ve done’. That your accomplishments and resume are what gives you value,” Levine said. “That is not true, in fact, and it's something that I believed for much of my life and that I still struggle with now.”
The musical follows a group of four students from Grayson High School’s Quiz Bowl Team A as they prepare for college admissions and the national quiz bowl championships. Like many college students might remember, these characters are stressed over finding an extracurricular that makes them stand out to the college admissions committee. After losing a competition, they are approached by The Literal Devil (Cailin A. Beirne ’24) and given the offer of encyclopedic knowledge in exchange for doing “the devil’s will in the world.” What follows is a story about the price of tying one’s self-worth to accomplishments and the willingness to do anything to win.
For Beirne, the play was an exciting opportunity to shape her original character. “You can’t just go back to a reference and say: I'm just gonna play it like this person. It's fun because even up until today we’re still making new character choices and trying things out,” she said. Her omniscient character ended up having a “little soft spot” that she played into.
But putting an original musical together takes more than acting and characterization. Director Sam F. Dvorak ’23 played a large part in getting the musical from book to reality. He got involved with the production in the spring of 2021, immediately struck by how intensely relatable he found Levine’s songs like “Dear Admissions Committee.” “[These characters of stressed out high school juniors worried about letting themselves down and letting the people they care about down … At one point we were also all stressed out high school juniors worried about getting into a good school. It felt like a show that could have a unique impact here,” he said.
Although Dvorak has previously directed virtual shows during the pandemic, this was his first time doing so on a physical stage. Like for Beirne, the fact that he was directing an original show proved both a challenge and opportunity. “There’s a really big sense of pressure that I was putting on myself to do right by this excellent show that has been created by people I admire, and to do a great piece of art justice,” he said. At the same time, the experience was also liberating. “You’re not constrained to any prior convention that has to happen. It’s a labor of love.”
To see her passion project not just come to life, but sell out the Loeb Experimental Theater in only 26 minutes was a surreal moment for Levine, and the end of a long and challenging journey. Due to the pandemic, Levine and Chang, who were in different countries, had to rely on texts and voice memos to shape the show during the two years it took to produce. They say it was well worth it.
“There are so many moments I’ve been moved and struck by the care that everybody is giving this story. So many people are excited about telling this story and that means the world to me,” Levine said. “Sometimes I have to do a double take and be like, ‘This thing that started from one sentence in a Google Doc for a final project is now living in this space and is going to have an impact on people.’ That’s a huge responsibility but it’s also something that I’m really really proud of.”
There’s no denying that the passion and care put into “The More You Know” made it unique. But for Dvorak, what makes it so special is its relevance. “I see myself in a lot of these characters, I see my friends in a lot of these characters and I think watching this show can make you a better person,” Dvorak said. “You can walk out of the theater and think about how you live and work in a new way and approach it in a better and healthier way. As our characters come to that cathartic conclusion at the end of the show I hope the audience can as well.”

Warm, chic, and welcoming in its newly-renovated space, Bosso Ramen Tavern is a Harvard Square newcomer. Walking in with the first group of excited restaurant-goers, the tables steadily fill as each party is seated to a chorus of “Welcome to Bosso!” from staff members and the jovial ambiance of a healthy, bustling, organic restaurant grows. The menu boasts a creative and exciting set of dishes, all worth sampling. Edamame Shiromiso Hummus — a successful work of chips, spices, and creativity provides a delicious appetizer. Washed down with a glass of rose, just one choice from an impressive suite of sake and wine options, the first pass is a delightful introduction to Bosso Ramen Taverns simple elegance.
On to the sushi: Plate by plate, Harvard Square veterans are guaranteed to find a new take (and taste) on sushi unlike anything else in the Square. Spicy salmon arrives nestled in a sheet of nori, under a bed of rice and spicy mayo; a garnish of radish and cilantro tops off another top-quality cut of fish. The vegetarian options surprisingly do not disappoint: the vegetarian roll is a flavorful mix of noodles and rice, accompanied by a crunchy outer shell.
Bosso Ramen Tavern does not shy away from the performance and spectacle of dining. Guests await their meal while watching chefs steadily build mouth-watering bowls of ramen and sushi, while a blowtorch is set off here and there and the waiters and waitresses bustle throughout the cozy but energetic space.
Perhaps the secret star of the show and closing act that will call for another visit to Bosso Ramen Tavern is the dessert:] culinary intelligence shines here, highlighting the masterful execution of a simple but ambitious menu. Black sesame ice cream with sweet potato ended an already impressive meal with equal flair and ambition.
Bosso Ramen Tavern has cleverly filled its own niche in Harvard Square, providing a culinary experience and atmosphere that compliments the larger restaurant ecosystem. The Square has recently seen a boom in ramen establishments: Menya Jiro, One Ramen & Sushi, and Hokkaido Ramen Santouka all offer visitors mid-range, fast-casual ramen and sushi experiences. Perhaps this dense population of ramen shops is an attempt to profit off the stereotypical college-students-living-off-ramen trope. Instant ramen has a reputation for being cheap and easy, and these college neighborhood ramen shops emphasize higher quality ingredients while preserving comfort and ease. Bosso Ramen Tavern, while perhaps benefiting from the university association, thoroughly rejects the dorm-food trope. The atmosphere is posh, with an unapologetic air of sophistication and caters towards a crowd much older than the average Harvard student. The prices are well out of the range of a student looking at Tasty Burger or El Jefe’s, ensuring a much yuppier crowd.
Bosso Ramen Tavern is catered towards creating an immersive experience as much as it is about serving food. The servers all share a bit of the restaurant's history and cultural roots, and the story of each ingredient is served along with its tasting notes. This positions Bosso Ramen Tavern as an immersive and intimate experience that goes beyond the menu (and artisan volumed servings) to offer portage to a culturally-charged experience. The food itself, though high quality and rich in flavor, is portioned in modest sizes compared to many of the late-night oriented Harvard square favorites (like El Jefe's gargantuan burritos…). Bosso Ramen Tavern’s plating — like its experience — is artistry, a well-curated fabric of greetings, staff, lighting, stories, and smells. The long lines queuing up across from the Smith Campus Center are here to stay for the foreseeable future, and Bosso Ramen Tavern will assuredly cement its reputation amongst diners in Harvard Square.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a long break, “Bridgerton” is finally back, this time following the romantic exploits of a different Bridgerton sibling.
The show has made strides to respond to the criticism leveled at Season One, particularly focusing on giving Eloise more agency. Last season, Eloise made many diatribes against life for women in Regency-era England; while that is not at all unreasonable in itself, she had no clear ambitions or opinions about what she wanted from life beyond the prescribed path for women of her class. This season has adjusted by having her read feminist literature and briefly learn about the existence of social activism. Unfortunately, this plotline falls by the wayside as the season gains momentum.

“Bridgerton” also introduces a new family this season: the Sharmas. Though they are a white family with a different name in the novel this season is based on, “The Viscount Who Loved Me,” the show reimagines their backstories so that the Sharma women are of Indian descent in a way that feels completely natural and compelling. While the world of “Bridgerton” still sorely lacks East Asian representation and mostly avoids engaging critically with race despite its color-blind casting, it does succeed in creating an inclusive escapist fantasy.
Unfortunately, the development of minor characters continues to be unfocused and sporadic. For example, Simon’s ex-boxer friend Will (Martins Imhangbe) decides to begin his own gentleman’s club for unclear reasons, and Queen Charlotte (Golda Rosheuvel) is given little chance for meaningful character development. This issue even persists with the titular family: the show’s handling of Colin Bridgerton’s (Luke Newton) insecurity and Benedict Bridgerton’s (Luke Thompson) burgeoning art career feels vague and shallow. Unfortunately, these filler subplots fail to reach satisfying conclusions, and are only sporadically present from episode to episode.
Overall, the show struggles to balance genre and structure: Is it an anthology of self-contained love stories, or a romantic period drama centering on one family? “Bridgerton” doesn’t know. Julia Quinn’s “Bridgerton” book series is the former, but in order to provide plot for a whole season (and make the supporting actors want to come to work) the show inputs random background plot threads without fully fleshing them out. This formula works well for a series of standalone novels that happen to be set in the same world, but is less suited to an ensemble television series. The show might be more coherent if it featured multiple relationships per season instead of having a revolving door of protagonists that renders other characters irrelevant. For example, the return of last season’s protagonist Daphne (Phoebe Dynevor) is characterized by cameos where she shows off her baby and comments on her brother’s love story, showing how her developed character has been reduced to a background prop outside of her season.
While many plot and character elements are a tad shallow, the set design and costuming nonetheless help ensure this world looks vibrant and believable. However, the show’s internal sense of social rules is inconsistent at best: all of the characters’ actions are supposedly ruled by their sense of social obligation, but the actual societal rules are unclear. “Bridgerton” tells us that if a man and woman are seen alone together, it is so scandalous they must immediately marry, but this is only adhered to once in Season One — in every other instance, everyone acts like it doesn’t matter. These inconsistencies make the stakes feel incredibly contrived.
This season’s protagonists, Anthony Bridgerton (Jonathan Bailey) and Kate Sharma (Simone Ashley), have fantastic chemistry from beginning to end, but their mutual poor decisions make their story difficult to watch at times, as they lie to everyone they love and cause an intense scandal in the name of “love.” The biggest victim of this is Kate’s kindhearted sister Edwina (Charithra Chandran) as she is manipulated by everyone around her, nominally for her own sake. Unfortunately, the individual traumas that drive Kate and Anthony’s selfish behaviors are never explored beyond a surface level. However, there are some great moments — the fan-favorite Pall Mall scene from the books is wonderfully adapted, and their relationship is certainly believable, thanks in large part to their actors.
This season also departs from the show’s original formula — a romantic drama with the yearning of a Regency-era romance and the smut of modern erotica — by toning down the sex. This choice works well for the most part, but a last-minute attempt at compromise results in some very unnecessary nudity. Similarly, the show’s heart — its titular family — struggles to be what the show claims that it is. The actors of the “Bridgerton” clan have pretty good chemistry when they are allowed in a room together and Season Two offered some more fun and meaningful one-on-one moments. Unfortunately, they are just that: moments. Hopefully, future seasons can dig more into the complicated sibling dynamics at play to create a fuller picture of the main family.
Ultimately, “Bridgerton” struggles with its identity as a series, which leads to some narrative and structural incoherence. However, as a fun and romantic historical drama, it should continue to please.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since Batman first appeared in Detective Comics (DC) in May of 1939, the comic book favorite has starred in more feature films than any other DC superhero. The most recent adaptation, Matt Reeves’ “The Batman” features a more emotional and cinematic take on the classic character. Not quite new to crime fighting but with much left to learn, Robert Pattinson’s Batman is a Batman-becoming. Like the Batmans that came before him, he displays an unparalleled ability to brood and is well on his way to achieving ridiculously outrageous levels of competence both in combat and detective work. Beyond these traits, however, what makes a good Batman? The answer, I think, lies more on who he is surrounded by than it does on any single iteration.
A good Batman should lack at least a little self-awareness. Mr. Wayne should be dramatic — the man names his gadgets variants of the word “bat” — and paranoid so as to be prepared for any outlandish scheme Gotham City’s criminals throw his way. Admittedly, this gloomy attitude can become tiring if it’s the character’s defining trait. Therefore, to make a good Batman he must be juxtaposed with other, less extreme but equally beloved characters in part so they can call him out. While this can be accomplished with a good relationship between Batman and Alfred Pennyworth, his butler and surrogate father, or Batman and frenemy Commissioner James Gordon, the greater the crowd, the richer the history and storyline.
The beauty of Batman is that he doesn’t work alone, and the irony of Batman is that he insists he does. He is a six-foot-something man dressed like a bat who insists he is darkness-incarnate and a loner. Yet, at every turn, he is trailed by at least one brightly dressed sidekick, superhero, or even on occasion, supervillain. The truth of the matter is that Bruce Wayne could never become Batman alone, and the involvement of other characters provides an opportunity to humorously call out Batman’s melodrama that oftentimes borders on ridiculous. However, these contrasts can also act as serious moments of character growth, as Batman’s interactions with Dick Grayson, the first Robin, often do in the comics and animated shows.
Another reason Batman works best in a group dynamic is because this setting offers a chance to show off his greatest skill — his leadership ability. Batman can be surrounded by superpowered heroes, aliens, magicians, and deities, and these larger-than-life characters will inevitably turn to him to light the way.
This isn’t to say that Batman is unbreakable, and in fact, he shouldn’t be. Where Superman and Wonder Woman — DC’s other most visible heroes — are virtually indestructible, Batman visibly bruises, and his body is perennially falling apart. Still, he gets up and fights with impressive and infuriating stubbornness. His superpowered colleagues turn to him as much as, and arguably more than, he turns to them. His actions become all the more admirable because he is so painfully human — the long nights patrolling the streets of Gotham and the blows he takes from villains twice his size all have a very relatable, very human cost that is highlighted in the best cinematic and television portrayals.
Though Batman’s ever-growing list of sidekicks can hardly be called sidekicks anymore (as many have taken on leadership roles in their own superhero teams), their honorable place in the DC franchise and its fandom is as much a testament to what makes Batman so iconic as it is to their own abilities. Though Batman’s relationships with these characters are not always the smoothest, any portrayal of Batman that does not feature these bonds leaves a monumental part of his journey as a hero untouched.
In the comics, this dynamic between Batman and his adopted family is often eagerly explored, whether it be in insular installations featuring primarily Gotham City or in narratives that span universes as in the “Infinite Crisis” miniseries. Recently, “DC vs. Vampires” — a self-contained maxiseries asking what would happen if the Justice League had to fight off vampires instead of their typical villains — has featured the Batfamily. Batman’s mentees and partners act as major turning points in the show with effects on the entire superhero community.
Though much less dramatic, the webcomic collaboration between “DC and Webtoon, Batman: Wayne Family Adventures,” has been popular with fans for its focus on the family dynamics of Batman and his associated heroes. Labeled a “slice of life” comic, it features small moments in the Wayne family’s lives creating vignettes around intimate and mundane moments like arguments over the last cookie after a night of patrol. While it has been criticized by some for containing too much fan service, the comic has 31.7 million views and nearly one million subscribers, leagues ahead of the average sales of recent Batman title series, which range from 83,000 to 118,000. From these numbers, it seems future takes on Batman’s character would be well served by an attention to the web of heroes that surround the seemingly independent character.
Highlighting the bonds Batman has made over the years provides only an opportunity to underscore his unique capacity for mentorship and leadership. Batman has undoubtedly shaped the DC universe and showing the extent of his care through these relationships is foundational to any worthwhile portrayal of his character.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the realm of contemporary horror movies and psychological horror thrillers, few topics are as dramatized (and exploited) as mental health crises. Countless popular films from “Black Swan” to “Hereditary” to “Shutter Island” have depicted psychological breakdowns in hallucinatory detail, often mining the surreal realities of certain conditions for jump scares and reinforcing stigmas and misconceptions around mental illness in the process. These films generally end on a bleak note, making a grim conclusion essentially a hallmark of the genre; their protagonists are left in the grips of their illness, and treatment is posed as a futile fantasy better suited for a different type of movie. Addison Heiman’s debut feature “Hypochondriac” flips this script, presenting a nuanced, engrossing story that is a welcome departure from the troubling tropes that have defined psychological thrillers until now. Skillfully directed, “Hypochondriac” is a knockout of an independent film that transcends its contained scope, delivering a beautiful queer love story and a moving portrayal of family trauma within its comedy-horror-thriller format.
Zach Villa is charismatic and heartbreaking as Will, a talented ceramicist in Los Angeles whose life is disrupted by the reappearance of his schizophrenic mother (Marlena Forte), who was institutionalized after she tried to kill him when he was 12. Heimann illustrates this experience and its immortalization in Will’s memory in the opening scenes, which depict the violent moment in symmetrical shots saturated with color; as the camera pulls away from the scene and the shot shrinks in the frame, dissolving into a backdrop of black, Heimann seems to bring the viewer into a diorama of Will’s past.
When we meet him again, 20 years later, the film has a dramatically different tone: Will dances around a pottery studio to the exalting notes of Jessie J’s “Domino,” radiating warmth and energy, and then pauses to coach his coworker Sasha (Yumarie Morales) through a panic attack by convincing her to freestyle rap in an endearing moment of camaraderie and kindness. In these moments, as in the rest of the film, Will comes across as a complex and naturalistic character, with a vivacious presence and empathetic instincts that make him easy to root for. He’s brilliantly drawn and acted, and he immediately appears like a familiar friend onscreen.
As the film progresses, Heimann masterfully depicts Will’s growing panic as he experiences a variety of disorienting physical and psychological symptoms, beginning with tension and pain in his hands that disrupt his pottery practice. Tense, kinetic shots of him kneading clay and forming pots on the wheel illustrate the disrupted meditative physicality of his art, drawing audiences into his fixation with diagnosing and addressing the problem. As Will struggles to find doctors who will take his concerns seriously, Heimann hilariously and poignantly critiques the one-size-fits-all platitudes that medical practitioners are all too ready to offer patients with unclear conditions, as multiple people diagnose him with “stress.” His frustrating conversations with the jarringly upbeat, bro-ey “NP Chaz” (Michael Cassidy) and perfunctory Dr. Rosenstein (Adam Busch) embody the kind of hilarious, targeted poignancy and creative body horror themes that characterize the film, making it at once entertaining and salient.
As Will’s physical and mental health deteriorates and he becomes more and more concerned that he’s experiencing a schizophrenic episode, the movie morphs into a horror film that effectively brings audiences into his mental state. He starts seeing a figure in a wolf suit (reminiscent of “Donnie Darko”’s Frank, which Heimann says he was paying homage to) beckoning to him, following his movements, and urging him to do increasingly terrifying things. While Heimann harnesses the tension and momentum of a psychological thriller to construct a viscerally affecting portrait of a breakdown, he resists the leering otherization and hysteria that often characterize film portrayals of mental illness. Even his portrayal of the wolf moves beyond showing him as an adversarial supernatural force; Will realizes that he must find a way to coexist with the wolf, like his mental illness itself. In one affecting scene, he sits beside the wolf and they watch home videos from his childhood, in which he dressed up in the same wolf costume.
As Heimann told film blog Rue Morgue, he wrote the film based on his own mental health struggles during the pandemic and his experiences with his mother, who has bipolar disorder. The script, distinguished by three-dimensional characters and realistic, sharp dialogue, combines the touching naturalism of a biographical film with the heightened atmosphere and threat of a horror film to captivating effect, speaking to Heimann’s skills as a talented filmmaker worth following in coming years.
It also delivers a moving and beautiful love story through its portrayal of Will’s relationship with his boyfriend Luke (Devon Graye), who struggles to understand Will’s growing concerns about his health and to support him when he realizes he may have schizophrenia. Graye gives an exemplary, emotive performance, and the authenticity of their on screen connection emerges in well-written moments of joy and discord, from the sweet moment when Will drags Luke up to dance with him in their vacation cabin to a fraught argument they have in Luke’s kitchen. Heimann cuts away from the latter scene quickly, midway through their confrontation. It’s one of many tactful editing choices that keep the movie sharp and mesmerizing, illustrating Will’s struggles without exploiting them for melodrama.
Though the film slows down a bit in the second act and sometimes feels slightly too long, its conclusion is well worth waiting for. The film follows Will past the height of his breakdown and hospitalization, a point at which many horror movies with similar subjects would have ended. He is shown meeting a sympathetic therapist at a hospital who coaches him on the ways he can get help and move forward in his life. In the film’s final moments, viewers glimpse early moments of his recovery, and the film is suffused with hope for the future ahead of him (and Luke.) It’s a refreshingly uplifting and open-ended finale, acknowledging what so many horror films refuse to — that its protagonist can lead a happy and fulfilling life, and has not lost his capacity to love or be loved. “Hypochondriac” is an important film for the horror genre, implicitly questioning how it treats mental illness and discards characters facing serious conditions. It’s also, however, an important film for the current moment, offering a gorgeously complex narrative of queer love and self-realization that transcends genre or audience.

Historically, adapting “Macbeth” into film has meant rich, detailed period pieces, from Orson Welles’ sweeping epic, to Akira Kurosawa’s visceral “Throne of Blood,” to Justin Kurzel’s luscious Palme d’Or contender. That’s what makes “The Tragedy of Macbeth” feel remarkably fresh: Writer-director Joel Coen paints his latest film in unapologetic, ethereal strokes of black-and-white expressionism.
It’s interesting that Coen, known for interrogating and subverting old Hollywood genres, has chosen a Shakespeare adaptation as his latest film. Coen’s diverse work consists of biting, reflexive, and distinctly American satires, from Bush-era crime films like “Burn after Reading,” to existential comedies like “Barton Fink,” to masochistic rom-coms like “Intolerable Cruelty.”
Suffice to say, “The Tragedy of Macbeth” is tonally different from Coen’s previous films — seething and haunting, rather than his usual mix of playful and cynical. That’s because story-wise, “Macbeth” retreads familiar territory: The titular Scottish general (Denzel Washington, in a towering, dynamic performance) encounters three witches (all played by Kathryn Hunter), who prophesize that he would be King. Adamant and power-hungry, Macbeth and his wife (Frances McDormand) scheme to kill King Duncan. Once crowned, however, Macbeth’s tyranny sparks a civil war — and eventually, his downfall.
Coen adapts plot and dialogue extremely faithfully — characters even speak in Shakespearean English. But these artistic choices don’t make “Macbeth” any less subversive: On a formal level, it’s just as twisted and genre-bending as Coen’s previous work. For one, the film isn’t shot in ancient castles and expansive landscapes, like the many adaptations before it. It’s shot entirely in sound stages to remove any semblance of reality.
“The Tragedy of Macbeth” is not a film about “Macbeth” so much as it is a film about the theatrical production of “Macbeth.” Coen deconstructs the unique performativity, lighting, and staging of theater productions — pulling from the medium-specificity of stage to imprint a vibrant, visceral, and eerily artificial texture into his film. Speaking in an interview at the New York Film Festival with festival curator and Harvard Professor Dennis Lim, Coen said “I think this proceeded from [Frances McDormand] asking me to [direct “Macbeth”] on stage. I didn’t want to abandon the notion of the play. It was taking a play, and making a movie of it, which was interesting to me. Not turning a play into a movie.”
To create the impression of artificiality, “The Tragedy of Macbeth” relies heavily on visuals, with detailed compositions by 6-time Academy Award nominee Bruno Delbonnel. In his early work with director Jean-Pierre Jeunet on “Amélie” and “A Very Long Engagement,” Delbonnel coated his film stock in a decadent layer of warm amber and nostalgic pastel green. His early characters popped off the screen with a zest that matched their passion for life. But Delbonnel used a more muted palette when he collaborated with the Coen brothers in “Inside Llewyn Davis” — while still using a surrealist license to capture the wistful alienation of artist ego.
Now, Delbonnel’s work in “Macbeth” takes surrealism a step further. Shot in black and white, “The Tragedy of Macbeth” is steeped in German expressionism — mirroring character interiority through complex shapes and long shadows, and leveraging visual tension on screen to create mood and atmosphere. Delbonnel uses extremely dramatic, harsh, single-point lighting to draw haunting shadows that reflect characters’ deepest fears and feverish insecurities. These techniques are accentuated by gorgeous modern architecture and production design, which hangs over the film like a subconscious, unsettling, anachronistic cloud.
“The Tragedy of Macbeth” was also filmed in black-and-white, and in a 4:3 Academy aspect ratio, to add multiple layers of reflexivity. In an interview at NYFF, Joel Coen explained the choices, saying that the idea of shooting “Macbeth” in black and white and in 4:3 was “there from the beginning… black and white is a way of instantly abstracting an image in a way that everyone understands. You’re abstracting it by taking the color away, but it’s not like people read it as being ‘abstract’ in quotation marks.” So, just as the film deals with the artificiality of theater, it draws the audience’s attention to artificiality within the film as well.
Overall, this sheen of artificiality enhances the most intense emotional moments in “Macbeth” to high-pitched sensory success. This hallucinatory atmosphere stretches from the mystical compositions when the witches appear, to the disturbing monologue in Lady Macbeth’s sleepwalking scene, to the isolation at the end of the film, when Macbeth’s battle is lost, and he saunters — delusional — through the empty hallways of his once great castle.
Though “The Tragedy of Macbeth'' is a very different film from the rest of Coen’s filmography, complete with archaic English and a 400-year-old story, it still manages to feel incredibly modern. It’s a unique twist on one of Shakespeare’s classics — an adaptation that draws on, and self-awarely engages in, cross-medium artificiality.

What separates those who dream and those who do — those who merely make a resolution and those who actually achieve their goal? While a large majority deem IQ scores and innate talent as primary predictors of success, one Harvard alumna uncovered the common factor that truly unites the accomplished: grit.
Angela Duckworth '92 describes grit as a “passion and perseverance for long term goals.” After graduating from Harvard College, Duckworth went on to become the Rosa Lee and Egbert Chang Professor of Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania and publish her 2016 New York Times best-selling book “Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance.” In the midst of a culture that prizes the innately talented, Duckworth persistently questioned how these people achieve so much. In an interview with The Harvard Crimson, the author revealed how to develop grit and perseverance and also how to create a focused goal worth the hard work.
Duckworth’s best-selling writing initially explains the ease of assuming natural talent, as it’s more convenient to avoid comparing oneself to a person with seemingly inhuman capabilities. Her empirical research, however, reveals that the highly accomplished do not possess superhuman skills, but rather an incredible work ethic and a goal-oriented mindset.
Her book focuses on interviews with countless paragons of grit — from West Point cadets to national spelling bee champions — to understand how perseverance and passion directly correlate to success. When studying West Point cadets, for example, Duckworth measured these high-achievers with standard metrics of intelligence quotients and physical fitness tests. Among the cadets who eventually graduated from the university, Duckworth found that the common factor among them was not intelligence levels or natural athletic abilities, but rather incredible levels of work ethic. She thus determined that grit is a better predictor of success than traditional measures.
Sprinkled with personal anecdotes and a relatable voice, Duckworth’s book makes for an authentic, memorable read. After reading the book and learning about the essential link between work ethic and goal achievement, readers are likely to wonder how they, too, can create a focused goal. It seems that in order for a person to practice grit — an active commitment to working towards a higher goal or purpose — one must first clearly define their goal.
When asked about goal creation, Duckworth reframed this seemingly monumental practice of finding a higher life purpose or calling with an effortlessly simple metaphor: “The paramecium is a single-celled organism, one of the most primitive on earth… And when it hits an obstacle, it backs up, it changes its angle, and tries again.”
Instead of limiting oneself to a life passion immediately, Duckworth reminds readers to take a step back and think of themselves as a paramecium, moving towards natural interests with genuine curiosity. Using the metaphor of moving away from the cold, Duckworth also explained that changing one’s plans for the future is “growth, not a lack of grit.”
After graduating from Harvard with a Bachelor of Arts in Advanced Neurobiology, Duckworth adjusted her original plan to attend medical school. Instead, she opted to earn a Ph.D. in Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania and now takes a more unstructured approach to goal setting. “An ultimate goal, a top-level goal, is like a north star. It is super useful and I’m not backing down from recognizing the usefulness of having a purpose,” she said.
Duckworth went on to explain how people feel this intense pressure to define a singular passion or “north star” when in reality, they should explore their many interests and values. Duckworth suggests that everyone ask themselves: “What are your values and where does your attention go spontaneously?”
“I love words. I’m really interested in human nature. One of my values is kindness and another value is excellence,” said Duckworth. “I found something that’s at the intersection of those two interests and those two values.”
At the end of the interview, Duckworth offered some essential advice for remaining hopeful and goal-oriented in the face of adversity. Much of this advice was rooted in her reflection on the Covid-19 pandemic.
“My recommendation isn’t just, ‘Hey, be gritty!’ — I’m convinced that pep talks don’t do very much for anyone,” she said. “But I do think that every time we experience emotions… that hopelessness that every one of us, including myself has felt, the first thing to do is to notice. To notice when you’re feeling exhausted, burnt out, or without hope. The next thing is to ask yourself in a curious, almost third-person way as if you were talking to a close friend, ‘I wonder why that is? What’s going on in life that makes me feel this way?’”
While other self-help books may offer the typical “fake it till you make it” advice, Duckworth prescribes a deep, personal reflection when facing failure or external challenges. Even in the face of external challenges, Duckworth explains that following this approach allows for “agentic hope” — the belief that “I can do this if I try.”
In a world congested with 10-year plans, Duckworth reminds readers that finding a purpose and calling is a beautifully messy and often long process that takes immense amounts of patience and trial and error. After reading “Grit,” readers will walk away with a profound sense of agency over their life and ability to achieve. With that power comes great responsibility — the responsibility to treat failure with compassion and find positivity in redirection.
While her book remains undeniably inspiring, the real inspiration is Duckworth’s personal success from following a set of her interests and passions to craft and achieve her goals. Duckworth brings a lightness and a level of creativity to goal setting, ultimately inspiring more dreamers to do.

Warning: This review contains spoilers for the first episode of “Moon Knight” on Disney+.
Every morning, Steven Grant (Oscar Isaac) wakes up before work, greets his goldfish with some lighthearted remarks, and heads out into the lively bustle of London, where he is a gift shop employee at an Egyptian museum. Amid Steven’s morning routine, however, it becomes startlingly clear that he sleeps with his ankle chained to a pole in his apartment and that he must undo an unusually large amount of locks on his door before he can go anywhere. There is evidently more than meets the eye when it comes to his role as the main character of Marvel Studios’ “Moon Knight.” The new show had its first episode premiere on March 30, and will have episodes premiering weekly.
The unsettling aura surrounding Steven can perhaps be attributed to the fact that he isn’t really Steven at all. In the Marvel Comics, the character of Moon Knight has multiple personalities. His “core” personality belongs to an American mercenary named Marc Spector, while Steven Grant is an alternate personality that he later develops. Nevertheless, we begin the first episode of the television series in the company of Steven, who is characterized on the surface as an eccentric man living in London — he’s a little rough around the edges and maybe knows a bit too much about Egyptian gods. But if there was any stability to this life, it comes apart rather quickly.
The episode spends most of its runtime tracking Steven’s ghastly bewilderment with his very malleable reality, creating a commensurate amount of confusion for the viewer as it continues. Its willingness to lean into ambiguity, though, is its best decision; the episode does a masterful job of ensuring that neither Steven nor the viewer knows what’s real in its many hallucinatory sequences, and Oscar Isaac delivers a convincing combination of surprise, craze, and fright in Steven’s expressions.
One of the episode’s great strengths is the way that it establishes the fluidity between Steven’s reality and his dreams. During what initially appears to be a dream sequence, Steven finds himself in the Alps and comes upon a crowd gathered around a character named Arthur (Ethan Hawke). Arthur also happens to be the lone character featured in the first scene of the episode, and his apparent importance is further established by the agency he exercises in Steven’s dream. Arthur and several others begin to pursue Steven for an Ancient Egyptian artifact he possesses, and Arthur’s role, seemingly grounded in reality, begins to beg the question of whether this is really a dream at all.
The episode’s camerawork often exhibits a laser focus on Steven’s facial expressions, helping to illuminate his ever-growing hesitancy. As such, there is a certain visual technique prevalent during the aforementioned sequence that creates a sudden haunting effect each time it is used. Whenever Steven is about to be apprehended by those chasing him, the camera zooms in on his panicked face and shutters as he seems to lose consciousness. When he regains consciousness, it zooms back out, as an astonished Steven realizes that he has resolved the situation with extreme violence. It is implied that these instances involve Marc taking over the body, and this notion is supported by the fact that a booming voice speaks to Steven throughout the sequence and calls him by the name Marc. The duality between these personalities craftily complicates Steven’s already-difficult task of deciphering what’s a dream and what isn’t.
The episode makes clever use of mirrors as another way of driving home the severity of Steven’s condition. During one scene that takes place in Steven’s apartment, he begins to hear a voice that he traces to his bathroom mirror. Though he doesn’t find anything at first, his bewilderment is soon met with seeming disgust from the man who looks back at him; his reflection is portrayed as its own person, implied to be Marc, who displays his own expressions, free of Steven. The dissonance established by this dynamic, as well as the continued uncertainty surrounding Steven’s hallucinations, communicates just how big a rift exists between these two personalities.
At the end of the episode, Steven finds himself being pursued by a towering creature in the museum where he works, and he is eventually trapped in a bathroom. As Marc peers at Steven through the bathroom mirror, the difference between them becomes apparent; Steven shakes violently and his pale visage exudes a sense of horror, whereas Marc’s gaze is one of eternal resolve. “You’re not gonna die,” Marc assures Steven, “let me save us.”
The sequence that ensues is perhaps the most perplexing of the episode, but given the precedent, it feels like the only natural conclusion. Steven allows himself to be consumed by Marc’s will, and the result is the decidedly brutal arrival of Marc and Steven’s superhero alter ego: Moon Knight. Presumably summoned by some supernatural force, Moon Knight powerfully pummels the creature that was chasing Steven, likely staining his own pristine white suit with a fresh coat of blood. Alas, it appears that life for Steven and Marc will become more confusing yet.

This review contains slight spoilers for the first episode of Season Three of “Atlanta.”
It’s been four years since the 22-time Emmy-nominated show “Atlanta” last premiered an episode. On March 24, the show came roaring back with a brazen audience fake-out.
When we last left off, rapper Paper Boi (Brian Tyree Henry) was just about to depart on a European tour with his manager Earn (Donald Glover). This latest episode, however, doesn’t pick up from here at all. Instead, the Season Three premiere hones in on the story of a young Black boy living with a new foster family, a plot which reveals itself to become increasingly sinister.
With that setup, naturally, this episode sees “Atlanta” lean more into its horror side, which we partially saw in Season Two’s “Teddy Perkins” episode. Now, unsettling visuals and macabre themes permeate the entire plot. On top of that, with the lens of horror, this episode also takes “Atlanta” headfirst into critiques of race relations and discrimination, criticisms that in previous seasons have been much more subtle.
Take, for example, the first sequence of the episode. An eerie aerial shot opens the scene, looking directly down on a lake and a boat occupied by two fishermen — one Black, one white. The men pass time giving their takes on critical race theory, where the white man explains that whiteness is entirely a social construct. He then tells the history of the creation of the lake they’re on, which, as it turns out, was once the site of a self-governing Black town, before it was forcibly swept away by the damming of a river. This grisly, haunting tone, punctuated by on-the-nose social commentary, sets the stage for the events that soon unfold, as well as the general mood for the rest of the episode.
Following this opening, the episode transitions to focus on the aforementioned boy, Loquareeous. It’s here that the show flexes its muscles for biting social commentary. After a guidance counselor witnesses him being disciplined by his mother, Loquareeous is taken away by Child Protective Services — representing a very real and widespread problem in America. His new foster parents are a white, hippie, lesbian couple who brew their own kombucha and pickle their own vegetables. They have three other foster children under their care, all of whom are also Black. The couple, to their credit, seems to be kind, nurturing, and cognizant of social issues, criticizing the non-indigenous Rihanna for using the term “spirit animal.”
But cracks soon start to appear in this woke façade. The parents declare that Loquareeous’s name is too hard to pronounce, so they re-christen him “Larry.” Their fried chicken recipe consists of microwaved drumsticks dipped in flour, because the food that Loquareeous typically eats has “too much salt and oil.” When Loquareeous tries to hum a rap song, his foster parents tell him to stop, to sing something “silly.” Here, the episode presents a sharp critique of the soft racism and microaggressions expressed by white “woke” liberals.
But, as the episode progresses, it becomes increasingly clear that the relationship between the foster parents and children is something far more problematic, wherein the four Black children work on a farm owned by two white women, are fed meager amounts, and are resigned to sleep in the “storage closet.” And this treatment only continues to devolve. Even “woke” white liberalism, it seems, is exploitative and parasitic of Black life.
The greatest horror of this episode, however, is that all of these events really did happen. Throughout American history, there have been numerous cases of majority-Black cities flooded, drowned, or otherwise built over by white governments, just as the fisherman earlier described in the episode. And, tragically, the plotline following Loquareeous and his foster family is based on a true story as well. Ultimately, this episode demonstrates a great strength of “Atlanta,” which is its ability to smartly weave together horrifying true events that illustrate the problems and fears underlying American society.
“Atlanta” has, historically, been surrealist, dramatic, magical, and sometimes even absurd, but at its core it has been a comedy. The Season Three premiere definitely continues to follow this, and delivers comic moments that sting with satire. For example, when Loquareeous holds a sign that offers “Free Hugs,” a white man ignorantly asks if “Hugs” is his dad.
This new episode, however, marks a considerable shift in tone and delivery. Instead of advancing a surreal, comedic environment that hints at ideas of social critique, this episode uses horror to much more overtly thrust ideas of race onto the audience. And it does so without any of its main characters. The original premise of the show, a Princeton dropout and his cousin trying to navigate the Atlanta rap scene, feels unrecognizable at this point.
This directional shift appears to be very much intentional. Showrunner Donald Glover seemingly expected audience backlash to the new season, tweeting, “please @ me this year if u talk shit on me.” And the official description of this episode hilariously reads, “Wow it's been a minute. I mean, I like this episode about the troubled kid but we waited 50 years for this?”
Whether fans like it or not, it’s clear this premiere episode has set the entire season’s tone to come.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Like so many others, Harvard College senior Julia Riew downloaded TikTok during lockdown, only to delete the viral app weeks after.
Back then, it was impossible for her to know how the app would change her life. Riew, who is pursuing a joint concentration in Theater, Dance, and Media and Music, had been working for some time on her senior thesis during lockdown. Six months into her project, she shifted gears, determined to tell a Korean story.
The librettist made the choice to switch because of a number of factors — including her dream of writing for Disney, as well as her grandmother’s moving in with her family during the pandemic. “In speaking with her, practicing with her, I realized how out of touch with my culture I was, and that I really wanted to write a Korean story this time,” she said.
Riew ultimately settled on the classic folktale of Shim Cheong, a young woman who travels to the watery lair of an underwater king in hopes of helping her father regain his sight.
On Jan. 7, in what then seemed like an ordinary Friday night for Riew, she re-downloaded TikTok and posted a fragment of her project.
By the next day, she had gained 10,000 followers.
“To be honest, I didn’t eat or sleep for two weeks after that, I was so high on the adrenaline of: What’s going on? What’s going to happen next? Are my dreams coming true?” she says with a laugh, phoning in from her Lowell House dorm.
Riew currently boasts over 89,500 followers on TikTok. Her videos, which provide glimpses into her creative process, total over 1.3 million likes. Titled “Shimcheong: A Folktale,” Riew’s thesis has since gone on to be performed in Feb. and March at The Loeb Experimental Theater and Farkas Hall Studio, respectively.
Time spent with her grandmother during the pandemic galvanized Riew to reappraise her cultural heritage. Yet her feelings of being culturally adrift are not new. (Riew adds as an aside that she wasn’t aware of Chuseok, the traditional Korean holiday heralding the mid-autumn harvest festival, until she came to college.) A Saint Louis native, she went to school with very few individuals of Asian descent. After her senior year of high school, Riew resolved to travel to South Korea in hopes of engaging more deeply with its culture.
Her heady vision of connecting seamlessly with Korea and “[being] just like everyone else,” however, never quite materialized the way she had hoped. The summer after her senior year of high school, she studied at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, an experience she calls “amazing.” Yet while she was there, Riew continually encountered reminders that she was perceived as Americanized and fundamentally unlike the other Koreans around her.
“I do remember being very surprised at how much of an outsider I felt I was. And I noticed even that when I would go to stores or when I would interact with people outside of college, people would speak to me immediately in English,” Riew said. “I asked one of my friends, I said, ‘How do they know that I’m American?’ And she said, ‘Oh, they can just tell by the way you look, by the way you dress, and — kind of everything about you.’ It really caused me to question my identity.”
Though Riew draws from the tale of Shim Cheong, she is not bound by it. In fact, she prefers to call her project “inspired” by the folktale, rather than its adaptation. When crafting her project, Riew was attentive to rendering a more dimensional female protagonist in Shim Cheong — someone who was defined not by her beauty and piety, but rather by her fortitude and conviction. “I wanted to create a protagonist that was courageous, and that took action on her own — that was basically an acting protagonist,” she said. “One of the main things that changed was, Shim Cheong’s journey is all driven by her love for her family and for her father, but it’s really a story of self-actualization at the same time.”
The gender dynamics are not the only things she wanted to reappraise through her thesis project. In reshaping the tale of Shim Cheong, the librettist also wants to “re-examine the way disability exists in the world.” She said conversations with a friend of hers, who is both blind and a composer, helped her understand how problematic this narrative is. “The moral of the story at the end — the resolution — is that the father regains his sight,” she said. “He said that his community often takes offense to these stories where the moral of the story is that the disabled person becomes ‘un-disabled.’”
Riew’s rise to acclaim has been dizzying. Parts of her artistic journey, however, were marked by the moments of doubt, frustration, and questioning — ones she pushed through to breathe life into the artistic vision that is now “Shimcheong.” Asked what advice she might have for folks embarking on a creative journey, Riew pauses for a few seconds before piecing together a response.
“Sometimes what makes you different is your greatest strength,” she said. “Nurturing that and giving that time to grow will open up opportunities, and will lead you to the people who won’t look down on you for studying what you want to study and doing what you want to do. When you find that home, and when you find that passion, I think it will point you in the direction that you need to go.”

Shot on the set of a film about the Salem witch trials, his genre-bending “Lux Aeterna” provides striking insights into the dynamics of filmmaking. Told through informal conversations between French actress Béatrice Dalle and British-French actress Charlotte Gainsbourg about their previous projects and heated arguments between Dalle and the producer, Yannick Bono, about the movie’s direction, “Lux Aeterna” is a brutal yet insightful dive into the power dynamics of creating a film, accented by Noé’s split-screen cinematography and occasional dissolution of the fourth wall.
Dalle and Gainsbourg’s opening discussion of their film careers gives viewers a glimpse of what’s to come, foregrounding an engaging narrative for the remainder of the film. In retelling her experiences with high-strung producers and tyrannical directors, Dalle is very candid about her thoughts on film crews she’s previously been a part of, showcasing the challenges actors face when attempting to realize an external creative vision. When complemented by the quote “Most filmmakers today are like the living dead, and their films are too,” briefly appearing on the screen, Dalle and Gainsbourg’s conversation makes Noé’s goal with “Lux Aeterna” abundantly clear. Conveying the difficulty of realizing a concept while maintaining your passion, Noé’s quote highlights the futility and disillusionment that some creatives may feel while making films.
As the crew begins shooting, chaos ensues with shots of actresses rushed through preparation and costuming. Among these frantic scenes, the creation of a scheme to get Dalle fired from set soon ensues, opposing Dalle’s ambition with that of the male director. Though Dalle’s film is a recreation of the Salem witch trials, she appears to be the one being hunted. Snarky remarks of “I can’t work with her” and “If you follow her long enough, we’ll find something to get her fired,” build the tension between Dalle and other members of the crew.
Despite its tense moments, humor isn’t absent from Noé’s film. Karl — a token “aspiring film director from Los Angeles” who pesters actresses to join his project while later saying they would remember the day they said no to him when he’s rich and successful — adds a lighthearted distraction from the growing strain between Dalle and her staff.
Noé’s signature split-screen cinematography immerses the audience in the production of the film, showing both actresses preparing for scenes and Dalle’s harsh directions for the lighting and sound teams. Steadily darkening lighting and separation between green and red in each frame set the stage for an intense culmination.
Shots of Dalle’s agonizing screaming while actresses are tied to stakes behind a red, green, and blue strobing background are the pinnacle of “Lux Aeterna.” Commands for the lights and sound teans to “Fix this!” overtake the actresses’ pleas for freedom, and angry responses from the producer engulf viewers in a devastating sensory experience. A result of the disconnect between Dalle, her crew, and the creative vision she is fighting to achieve, the strobing lights are Dalle’s last straw. While “Lux Aeterna” means eternal light, this is Dalle’s darkest moment. As the actresses are painfully consumed by the strobing, almost white, lights behind them, Dalle and Gainsbourg are at their worst. By the end, they are struggling to free themselves from their respective enclosures. Gainsbourg is literally tied up while Dalle is figuratively trapped by the producers and staff who despise working with her.
An astounding presentation of a film set, Noé ventures into the visual and auditory extremes to convey his perspective on film-making. Embodying the difficulty that executing an idea can entail, “Lux Aeterna” illustrates the divide between fantasy and reality in the creation of art. Through Noé’s unique simultaneous framing of opposing forces, “Lux Aeterna” presents a grave view of film creation. Communicating the brutality of film production to viewers, Noé’s film is an experience viewers won’t soon forget.

“This one will fight.” Although describing the birth of the central character Sunja (played by Yu-na Jeon as a child, Minha Kim as a teenager, and Youn Yu-jung as an elderly woman), this line encapsulates the spirit of “Pachinko”’s premiere. Released on Apple TV+ on March 25, “Pachinko,” directed by Kogonada and Justin Chon, adapts Min Jin Lee’s bestselling novel of the same name. The series recounts the determination, desires, and dreams of four generations of a Korean immigrant family as they struggle to prosper in Japanese-occupied Korea, Japan, and the United States. Viewers watch Solomon Baek (Jin Ha) in 1989 as he attempts to rise through the ranks of a New York finance firm while also viewing the story of his grandmother, Sunja, in her youth.
“Pachinko” is wonderfully atmospheric, particularly when depicting 1910s Korea. Shots filled with dusty hanboks of the Koreans and pristine uniforms of the Japanese are fully committed to their time period. Emphasizing the importance of the connection between people and land, the premiere is filled with sweeping landscape shots of dense forests, inky oceans, and golden fields of grain. The densely-packed and slightly eerie fish market and gloomy boarding house are equally fascinating environments.
The use of sound and language is also compelling. Opening its episodes with the message, “Pachinko is presented in its two original languages, Korean and Japanese,” the show is particularly nuanced when watched with subtitles. Any on-screen text cycles between English, then Japanese, and finally Korean, an order reversing the journey of the family. Korean and Japanese are subtitled in yellow and cyan, respectively. The two colors are more than cues for listeners to distinguish between the two languages, acting as a visual distinction between Korean and Japanese to allow viewers to better understand the mindset of each character. While in present-day Osaka, the elderly Sunja speaks exclusively in Korean to Solomon, who often intersperses his Korean with Japanese vocabulary. In his subtitles, cyan words often stand out in stark contrast amongst the rest of the sentence in yellow. When greeting his father for the first time in many years, Solomon refers to his father in Korean, then immediately proceeds to converse exclusively in Japanese.
The understated and quiet acting is a good match for the frenetic, almost-melodramatic plot. Youn Yu-jung, whose wide repertoire includes “Minari” and “The Bacchus Lady,” spins the aged Sunja with a weathered, tired disposition, her face often reflecting the weight of her past. On the other hand, Yu-na Jeon casts the child Sunja as observant and precocious, and her curiosity infects her every scene.
The use of sound editing in “Pachinko” is perhaps most interesting due to its connection to time. In the opening of the first episode, Sunja’s mother, Yangjin (Jeong In-ji) begs a shaman to help her successfully carry a pregnancy after losing her first three sons. While the shaman stokes a fire, dances, and beats a drum to a progressively louder and quicker tempo, we watch as the past scenes get spliced with Solomon in the present arguing with his white bosses over a promotion: clearly, this family has endured. The drum beat, diegetic in the past and non-diegetic in the present, seems to almost dilate time. Time similarly flows from present to the past. When Solomon hears an announcement of Emperor Hirohito’s death over the radio, the scene smoothly transitions to the boarding house and a man coughing up blood while the radio still plays. Sunja’s father and Hirohito, two tall figures in the past and present, seem to pass away at the same time.
But it is the title sequence that is most noteworthy. Grainy shots of Japanese occupation and the colonization of Korea tinted red, blue, and yellow become increasingly interspersed with shots of the titular family-owned pachinko parlor. The four generations of the family, each garbed in their period-appropriate dress, dance, laugh, and celebrate to the Grass Roots’ “Let’s Live For Today.” Almost-shockingly bright and colorful, especially in contrast to the dusty, earthy tones used in shots in both past and present, the sheer happiness and joy of the family is palpable and commands the viewer’s attention. Although visually contrasting with the actual scenes, the title sequence still resonates thematically, with characters of the past interacting with the faces of the present. It is perhaps a necessary part of the series. While the show tends towards the somber and the characters’ consistent suffering suggests definitely embody’s the show's opening words that “the People endured,” this loud and frenzied sequence undeniably brims with the hope, triumph, and declaration of the family’s spirit that ultimately drives them forward.

With strong visuals and audio, “Pachinko”’s premiere is an enticing look into the sprawling history of Sunja’s family and the lasting desire within them to endure and obtain joy.

On March 30, the Annual Henri Zerner Lecture returned to the Harvard Art Museums for the first time since 2019. Internationally renowned German artist Christiane Baumgartner presented her monumental woodcuts, highlighting the value of slowing down and taking her time in the contexts of both her process of creating artwork by hand and her path to finding her personal artistic style.
The highly-anticipated event, sponsored by Harvard’s Department of History of Art and Architecture and the Harvard Art Museums, was rescheduled several times due to the Covid-19 pandemic and became the first public gathering to take place in Menschel Hall since quarantine began. Between the long wait and the impressive artist, attendees were thrilled to be there — the excitement was palpable.
“I’m a big fan of the museum, I come here often for research purposes, and in particular tonight, I’m here for this lecture because I admire the artist,” said Tiziana Rozzo, an MFA student at Lesley University.
Baumgartner, beginning her lecture by sharing some of her early works from the 1990s, emphasized that it took her a long time to figure out what exactly she wanted to create as an artist. She showcased several of her works — including a few that she does not like — because she considers them important to understanding her journey.
Much of the lecture focused on the practice of woodcutting, a form of fine art printmaking. Her technique is marked by attention to detail and small, deliberate cuts evident in the photos and videos she displayed. She does not use a laser cutter; all of her woodcuts are done by hand, contributing to the slow pace of the process. The final works possess the precision of a digital image but the aesthetic touch of a painting.
“I have a whole new appreciation for the knowledge and skill required for such a meticulous process to yield these big, impactful images,” said Harvard Professor Carrie Lambert-Beatty of the Department of History of Art and Architecture and the Department of Art, Film, and Visual Studies.
For a period of time, video became Baumgartner’s primary medium, which informed her appreciation for woodcut. Baumgartner emphasized the stark differences between the two, describing video as the quickest production technique and woodcut as the slowest. When she returned to a focus on woodcut, she used video stills as inspiration and the subjects of her work. Shifting away from more generalized techniques, Baumgartner found her signature style in 2001 with a piece titled “Lisbon I-IV,” four woodcuts crafted to depict the image of a video still.
Baumgartner’s style has continued to develop over time. For example, she only began to experiment with the use of color in the late 2010s after 25 years of woodcutting. In 2019, she began to experiment with the use of wood that was not carved.
“Sometimes what looks so easy in the end takes the most time,” said Baumgartner.
She concluded the lecture by showing photos of “Wish You Were Here” (2020), the last body of work she created before the pandemic. It depicts an island in Germany, but Baumgartner shared that it actually represents her dreamland — a “remembered landscape.” It demonstrated the evolution of her work over time, and every stage of her career was of great interest to the audience.
“When she first showed us her technique of carving, it was so shocking, and then by the end of the lecture, it felt like I had gone through the whole process with her,” said Molly German, who studied Painting at Boston University and currently works in the department of History. “It was a very exciting experience.”

You don’t even need a visual reference, they’re so easy to picture: Leonardo DiCaprio as Gatsby, toasting an adoring crowd as fireworks go off behind his head, Donald Glover walking into a burning room with pizza, a white lady trying to do some math. They’re some of the most universally recognized images on the internet. Since the beginning of the internet, the GIF has been one of the most pervasive forms of digital communication and the subject of much debate. From text messages to Twitter replies to large depositories like Giphy, the GIF is inescapable for anyone with an Internet connection.
Last week, Stephen Wilhite, tech developer and creator of the GIF, passed away only a few days after his 74th birthday. Infamous for pronouncing his creation with a soft g, Wilhite leaves behind a legacy of the digital image that far outreaches the (incorrect!) pronunciation of his famous invention.
Like many things on the Internet, the GIF was born out of a quest for efficiency. While at CompuServe, the world’s leading online service provider at the time, Wilhite and his team were tasked with finding a file format that packed as much information as possible into the fewest bytes. Stringing together a slew of computer science experiments and knowledge, Wilhite presented the GIF to the CompuServe execs. And thus: the GIF was born on June 15, 1987.
Though the GIF was initially used as a still image transmission tool, the file format was quickly adapted to convey short looping animations. The first ever GIF was beautifully simple: a gray airplane moving through a sky of blue and white flickering pixels. Since then, the GIF has spread throughout the Internet, with some of the first memes circulating on the Internet taking the form of GIFs. The Dancing Baby, depicting a small baby dancing to “Hooked On a Feeling,” was circulated through email chains in a bizarre pre-social media version of a meme in the mid-90s. Beyond humor, GIFs have become a form of art. From Singapore’s Noise GIF Fest to amateur Tumblr GIFs, many artists have turned to the GIF as a new form of digital art to elevate still paintings and photographs.
The widespread permeation of Wilhite’s invention is proof that digital images have power. GIFs have played a large role in recapping U.S. presidential debates, distilling lofty and complex debates into a series of digestible digital clips. GIFs of former president Donald Trump were widely circulated during the 2016 election, both highlighting his exaggerated body language and parodying his ludicrous expressions. It was 2016 — the U.S. presidential election was reckoning with a fully grown up version of the Internet. During those contentious times, the GIF was a way of capturing the bundle of complicated feelings associated with modernity into a few seconds.
But why, out of all the file formats, did the GIF attain widespread popularity? Wilhite’s invention is unique for occupying that space between simple and nuanced. It captures a little less information than a video, but more than an image. Even more so, in an era of text message and Tweet, the GIF became its own form of digital body language. GIFs are “an innovative way for speakers to convey a sense of gesture on the internet,” linguist Chi Luu says in a 2015 article. In other words, nothing can describe the unique mix of disappointment, aggravation, and frustration of a face-palm than the famous Captain Picard GIF.
But the exaggerated gesturing of the GIF has not come without its drawbacks. GIFs have been critiqued for their role in the perpetuation of digital blackface. GIFs like those of Oprah waving her arms, Tiffany Pollard rubbing her temple, or Shaq shimmying, are modern examples of minstrelsy, making a caricature out of a Black person’s actions for white entertainment. As Lauren Michele Jackson wrote for Teen Vogue, “white and nonblack users seem to especially prefer GIFs with black people when it comes to emitting their most exaggerated emotions.” What made GIFs unique and convenient allowed them to be misused and adapted into reductive stereotypes.

The GIF used to be everywhere. You couldn’t open Twitter or Tumblr without seeing one. Yet, with improvements in technology making it easy to embed short videos into Instagram and Twitter, and the rise of TikTok, one can’t help but wonder — does the GIF have the same power that it used to? There are faster, more efficient file formats, and GIFs are increasingly becoming associated with older Internet users. But despite their decline in popularity, GIFs have a steady fan base. The r/gifs reddit has 21.4 million followers, and continues to post daily. GIF usage went up by 33% in the first month of the pandemic alone. In the 35 years since Stephen Wilhite invented the GIF, they have transformed into a cultural force — at once art installation, satire piece, political cartoon, and conversational reply. And this much is true: The powerful cultural legacy of the GIF will continue to honor its creator.

Student performers, academics, and industry professionals gathered in the Knafel Center late Thursday, March 31, for “To Laugh Is Your Only Job,” a standup comedy show followed by a panel discussion. The event was held as part of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study’s two-day Gender and Comedy conference.
Opening with remarks from Professor Shigehisa Kuriyama, the Reischauer Institute Professor of Cultural History at Harvard, the standup portion of the night was hosted by Charlotte J. Daniels ‘23 and Claire J. Orrange ‘23 and featured a series of standup comics from the Harvard College Stand-Up Comic Society and the Harvard Undergraduate Feminist Comedy Collective.
Nothing was exempt from joke material, including the venue’s pronunciation (apparently the ‘K’ in ‘Knafel’ is not silent), the comics’ various gender and identity crises, and Go-Gurt.
“This was just as good as anything I’ve seen in New York as of late,” said audience member Rox V. Samer of the show. “I was really impressed with these young Harvard folks.”
Kuriyama returned to moderate the night’s panel discussion, which included student comics Isabel M. Levin ‘23 and Claire K. Yoo ‘23 as well as entertainment industry insider Lynn Harris and University of North Carolina professor Michelle Robinson. The panel fielded questions from the event’s online and in-person audiences using an anonymous form. The discussion focused on appropriate expressions of identity and trauma in comedy, the history of women, trans, and non-binary comics, and comedy’s place on college campuses.
“I was especially excited to hear from one trans standup and to hear many shoutouts to trans and non-binary comics,” said Samer. “I think a similar event ten years ago would have been 99% about women. This was a much more comprehensive and complex understanding of gender and comedy.”
“I joked earlier today that going on a panel after doing standup is like being in a post-game ESPN interview right after doing a basketball game,” said Yoo. “I’ve never been able to reflect on my comedy right after doing it… it was a really great exercise.”
Levin discussed the process of refining her standup set from earlier in the night in which she spoke about the Holocaust and her experiences as a Jewish person in an effort to strike a better balance between making the audience laugh and talking about incredibly difficult topics. Harris and Robinson cited many of their favorite female comics, such as Cameron Esposito, in addition to providing important context about the history of American comedy and its current state of affairs for non-male-identifying performers.
After speaking candidly for almost an hour, the panel came to a close. The room had an upbeat atmosphere as students celebrated the occasion with audience members, many of whom were involved in the comedy scene themselves or spent part of their careers studying it.
“This event represents an institutional shift in the focus that gender and comedy is getting on campus and how that might disseminate outwards to the greater comedy scene,” said Orrange. She credits the shift to the recent creations of the Undergraduate Feminist Comedy Collective, the undergraduate publication Peanut Kid Magazine, and the push to diversify on-campus standup.
The exercise of understanding earlier societal ideas about what constitutes comedy and who gets to be called funny and then actively broadening that understanding will hopefully continue outside of Harvard’s campus. All undergraduates are welcome to join the Stand-Up Comic Society and related organizations and bring to the table any experience or topic that they want to try to make funny. While it’s clear that more work must be done in the industry, this event and its broader conference were surely a memorable milestone along the journey toward progress.

For the 30th anniversary of the “Kirby” franchise’s debut in 1992, series developer HAL Laboratory released “Kirby and the Forgotten Land”: the first fully 3D mainline entry in the series. Kirby could hardly ask for a better birthday present. “Forgotten Land” effortlessly transitions Kirby into the third dimension and pushes the scope of the series’ traditional ideas, all while maintaining its core identity of accessibility and variety.
The game opens with Kirby taking a relaxing flight over his home planet, Planet Popstar, when a vortex suddenly appears in the sky, sucking in Kirby and inhabitants of Popstar known as the Waddle Dees. When Kirby wakes up, he finds himself in a post-apocalyptic world, lying on an unfamiliar beach surrounded only by birdsong, and here “Forgotten Land” differentiates itself from the games before it; the player gains control, and without ceremony or any attention drawn to it, Kirby is running around a 3D space.
Like previous mainline entries in the “Kirby” series, “Forgotten Land” is a platformer, where Kirby must run, jump, and fly through linear stages while inhaling enemies to copy their abilities for use in combat and puzzle solving. HAL Laboratory translates these core mechanics so expertly and naturally into a 3D space that players may forget that they’re moving along the z-axis at all. Kirby controls fluidly, and the simple act of running and jumping is satisfying.
While 2D franchises undergoing their first jump into 3D are prone to buggy, generic, and generally subpar results, “Forgotten Land” avoids these pitfalls. In fact, the only indication that HAL Laboratory hasn’t already been producing 3D “Kirby” platformers for years is that the game features a below-average number of Copy Abilities for Kirby to acquire, and those which are available tend to have limited movesets.
This lacking selection of Copy Abilities, however, is made up for by the inclusion of Evolution Abilities, a new mechanic in which Kirby can use blueprints he finds in stages to upgrade his Copy Abilities into stronger versions with special properties. For example, he can evolve his Fire ability into Dragon Fire, increasing the range of his fire breath and allowing him to glide through midair like a dragon.
Evolution Abilities introduce variety into the Copy Ability gameplay, allowing players to choose not only which Copy Ability they want to use but also which evolution of that ability would be best suited for the task. “Forgotten Land” also debuts two entirely new Copy Abilities: Ranger, which lets Kirby wield a blaster gun, and Drill, which takes full advantage of 3D space by allowing Kirby to burrow underground.
The other main mechanic introduced in “Forgotten Land,” and the signature innovation of the game, is Mouthful Mode. When an object is too large to fully inhale, Kirby can instead wrap his elastic body around it, granting him new capabilities. For instance, Car Mouth mode allows Kirby to zoom around as a very pink car, and Vending Mouth mode sees Kirby use the form of a vending machine to assault enemies with a projectile barrage of canned drinks. Mouthful Mode brings Kirby’s trademark inhale and copying abilities into a hilarious direction, and because Kirby can switch into and out of Mouthful Mode quickly, it synergizes and flows perfectly with the traditional “Kirby” gameplay, adding another layer of variety to combat and puzzle solving.
These new mechanics aid Kirby as he battles the Beast Pack, an organization of wild animals which he encounters in the new world. The Beast Pack is kidnapping the Waddle Dees who were sucked into the vortex, and along with his new friend, Elfilin, Kirby sets out on an adventure to rescue them and discover what the beasts are trying to accomplish. Meanwhile, the abandoned city streets, empty amusement parks, and overgrown malls that Kirby ventures through lead the player to wonder what happened to civilization in this world.
As usual for Kirby, the plot of “Forgotten Land” largely remains in the background so as to not overtake other elements of the game however, players will still find a mid-game tone shift characteristic of the series’ identity, along with a high-stakes, dramatic climax and some of the most fascinating “Kirby” lore to date.
On this adventure to save his friends, the stages Kirby explores are filled with a constant stream of new ideas that each receive proper fleshing-out, while mission objectives and collectibles — including captured Waddle Dees, figurines, and blueprints — provide opportunities for exploration and replayability. The player can also try the many Treasure Road short challenge stages that each push a specific Copy Ability or Mouthful Mode to its limit.
Further content gradually becomes available in the Waddle Dee Town hub as well as after beating the game. Throughout the entire playtime, difficulty select options and two-player co-op keep the game accessible for everyone and perfect for relaxing fun, while the late game and postgame will challenge even experienced players.
The stunning art and music direction only further enhance the gameplay. “Forgotten Land” runs at a stable 30 FPS, and although faraway models being rendered at a lower frame rate may occasionally be distracting, the stellar artstyle easily outweighs the slight technical limitations, creating expressive characters and cinematic, painterly vistas.
The catchy, diverse music also highlights the environments and complements the action on screen. Departing from tradition, the soundtrack features very few remixes from previous “Kirby” entries, emphasizing the alien setting while maintaining cohesion with 30 years of “Kirby” musical history through frequent use of iconic “Kirby” leitmotifs and quoted phrases. “Forgotten Land,” overall, is stuffed with a mouthful of charm, joy, and attention to detail; the love that HAL Laboratory put into the game speaks for itself.
Much as Kirby finds himself in a new world, the “Kirby” series finds itself in a realm of new possibilities with “Forgotten Land.” However, it would be a mistake to assume that the game is a vortex-jump apart from the series before it. “Forgotten Land” is a “Kirby” title through and through, with its level design, mechanics, and philosophy of accessibility and variety skillfully adapted and expanded from the 2D titles, such that people who enjoy 2D Kirby will enjoy 3D Kirby, and vice versa.
Undoubtedly, Kirby could hardly ask for a better birthday present. “Forgotten Land” delivers an unforgettable experience that will delight “Kirby” veterans with its innovations and cause a new generation of players to fall in love with the pink puffball and his franchise — and there’s no higher order for an entry in a long-running series to reach.

Some things matter so much that their absence, even if for the better, is hard to put into words. Harry Styles’ latest single “As It Was,” released on April 1, confronts this difficulty from both up close and at a distance, making the British pop star’s nostalgia feel universal as well as personal.
In an early-pandemic interview with Rolling Stone, Styles said that isolation — the very subject of “As It Was” — enabled him to adopt “almost like a bird’s-eye view of the world.” The track embraces this newfound perspective right away, starting not with Styles’ own voice but rather with a clip of his goddaughter’s. “Come on, Harry, we want to say goodnight to you,” she insists, as if trying to coax him out of hiding.
When Styles finally answers, his mellow tone takes some edge off the metallic brightness of the ‘80s synths underneath. Still, the polyrhythm formed by the vocals against a snappy backbeat generates tension that rises to match the first verse’s lyrical contradictions. Styles claims he has “nothin’ to say,” but he also admits that “Gravity’s holdin’ me back / I want you to hold out the palm of your hand.”
In the chorus, high-pitched warbles and a buzzing pedal point fill the space between Styles’ repetitions of the lines, “In this world, it’s just us / You know it’s not the same as it was.” As Styles specifies a certain world over and over, his past recedes into another.
The synth hook from the opening reappears before the second verse, which introduces one more point of view when an apparent ex asks two devastating questions on the phone: “Why are you sitting at home on the floor? / What kind of pills are you on?”
After another chorus, the bridge begins with a line about “light-speed internet,” and Styles speak-sings his way to the outro just as quickly. “I don’t want to talk about the way that it was,” he says. In the end, he’s already told us that “it’s not the same” now — and what more do we need to know?
Instead of picking apart specifics, Styles hones in on the shock of change itself. He announced “As It Was” as the lead single off his upcoming album “Harry’s House,” and the honesty of his longing for bygone days will surely hit close to home for many.

Sally Thames is a YouTuber who makes videos discussing books and the various lenses through which they can be read. She produces a range of content, including videos which show her reading books inspired by specific time periods or the literary tastes of fictional characters. Uniting music and pop culture with her passion for reading, Sally Thames brings a unique perspective to the community of “BookTube,” or YouTubers who create book-related content.
Thames has been part of the BookTube community since 2011 as a viewer, sourcing most of her book recommendations from the videos she watched. Though Thames attempted to start a channel previously during her time in college, educational commitments prevented her online career from taking off. When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, Thames’ job and time in school came to an abrupt end, giving her time to work on a personal project: her new YouTube channel.
“I just decided to start the channel and have a place to talk about the books I was reading; I was mainly doing it for me and my family,” Thames said in an interview with The Harvard Crimson.
As a viewer, Sally Thames admired the ability of other creators to read books through a specific lens and made sure that she was able to bring a unique perspective to the community through her videos. Citing Jack Edwards and Uncarley’s videos as inspiration, Thames hopes to bring context by reading and discussing books centered around various time periods, music albums, and fictional characters.
“I think it’s a really interesting way to read and I like being able to see how people extrapolate on the characters and shows that they love,” said Thames.
Conversation and connection are some of Thames’ favorite things about her channel and the greater BookTube community. She wishes that YouTube allowed for more than just subscriber comments to foster those interactions.
Within the growing reading community across social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok, Sally Thames feels most at home on YouTube. She loves reading Instagram reviews of books and looking at the titles on others’ shelves, but for Thames, YouTube provides the space, length, and format to discuss books imperfectly. On YouTube, there’s no pressure to create an eloquent masterpiece of a caption that summarizes all of her thoughts on a book.
The influence of social media, specifically TikTok, is definitely felt by Thames, from constantly hearing about what her friends are reading to finding “as seen on TikTok” sections in bookstores. Popular books on TikTok don’t always align with Thames’ taste, however, and she doesn’t understand how anyone can fall in love with a book after watching such a short video.
“I’m always convinced to go buy a book when I hear somebody gushing about it, in a way that hasn’t been the standard on BookTok,”said Thames.
While Thames is a big fan of Bookstagram and BookTok as an observer and consumer of content, she feels most comfortable communicating her own thoughts to an audience on YouTube.
Balancing her personal passions with the preferences of her viewers has always been a point of consideration for Thames since she does make money from her channel. She finds that her videos do best when she is excited about what she’s making and prioritizes enjoying the development of her content, trusting that her audience will love it just as much as she does.
“I try to only do videos I really want to do because reading starts to feel like a chore and if someone doesn’t like that, they can go watch someone else,” she said.
As a former overworked college student who has fallen in love again with reading, Thames has watched anxiously as pressure builds among the reading community to read a certain number of books each year or share statistics about one’s reading habits.
“There’s such a pressure that comes along with BookTube and BookTok especially when people talk about their reading statistics. It feels like it's a competition, and to me that’s a completely backwards way to look at reading,” said the YouTuber.
Thames advises people who want to read more but are struggling to do so to change their mindset about reading. Viewing reading as a form of self-care as opposed to just another thing to check off a list can make it feel more enjoyable and less like a hassle.
In her time as a member of BookTube, Thames has witnessed disparities in the levels of success between white creators and creators of color. While in recent years, she’s seen many creators of color like WithCindy, ellias, and fictionalfates grow in views, the most popular creators are still predominantly white. As an avid reader of classics, Thames also scrutinizes the authors that she reads for her videos and does her best to balance specific “To Be Read” lists (such as Reading like Jess from Gilmore Girls) with her desire to read diversely.
As a white creator, Thames explained that while she can’t speak on the experiences of creators of color within BookTube, she can be intentional about the voices she’s reading.
Looking ahead to the future of her channel, Thames hopes to expand to Patreon and Discord to facilitate more interactions within her community of viewers and establish an additional way to make an income from her content.
“I’m starting a Patreon and hopefully even with just a little extra financial boost I’ll be able to make more videos with the same quality,” Thames shared.
A long-time member of BookTube who recently started her own fast-growing channel, Sally Thames brings a unique perspective that reimagines how her viewers interpret contemporary and classical fiction. Thames’ content has quickly become a staple within the reading community on YouTube. As her vision evolves and changes, Thames will be sure to carry her passion for reading and connecting with others into her future endeavors, on YouTube and beyond.

Following the publication of three widely successful novels, Ottessa Moshfegh takes a different turn in her latest, “Lapvona.” Set in the titular medieval village of Lapvona, the novel depicts the bleak unfolding of a year’s worth of events and complex relationships between the residents. Along the way, several lies are uncovered, and the narrative explores the role of religion and corruption in the feudal society. Overall, “Lapvona” deftly weaves together a multifaceted view of a group of citizens and the political and moral issues they face, although the individual characters and overall plot arc ultimately fall a little flat.
The novel’s greatest strength lies in Moshfegh’s ability to spin several individual storylines that collide with each other in complex ways. As new characters are introduced throughout the story, the narration shifts towards their point of view, allowing the reader to understand their backstory and how they fit into the societal dynamic. Moshfegh manages these shifts quite well: They are appropriately spaced out, making it easy to keep track of the multitude of characters, and the novel frequently returns to the perspective of its two protagonists, a lamb herder Jude and his son Marek, which prevents the story from being unfocused.
With a large arsenal of characters and shifting perspectives, “Lapvona” is able to cover multiple seemingly independent character trajectories. Throughout the story, different subsets of the characters collide and interact with each other in various settings, and it all pays off at the climax, when a majority of the characters all encounter one another over the course of one night. The buildup of the characters’ interactions makes the climax quite satisfying — after pages spent apart, everything seems to finally come together.
However, one short side of “Lapvona” is its lack of compelling characters. The story’s frequent shifts between characters makes it difficult to feel any attachment to any specific person, and the novel does not try to make any character particularly likable either. The characters all seem to embody one trait to the extreme and stand in as archetypes. Not one undergoes any deep reflection or change — several shallowly try to do so, but each still remains in the confines of their original self.
Furthermore, the events leading up to the climax and the events following drag on a bit. The exposition in the beginning is a little too long, and in the second half, there are stretches of time where not much happens at all. The plot seems directionless at times, and along with the lack of character development, this makes the story arc fall short. In the end, it feels as if nothing useful has been learned or accomplished; even those who do learn something are unable to use their knowledge in any meaningful way.
On the other hand, “Lapvona” does a great job in its depiction of corruption and deception. It is revealed early on that the village priest Father Barnabas and the ruler Villiam are in cahoots to exploit the villagers out of greed. Their deception drives the main actions of the story, creates a bleak divide between lack and excess, and contains clear parallels to greed and corruption in the real world. Beyond this, there are several other instances of duplicity. Moshfegh cleverly illustrates these moments of deceit by giving the reader a sense of what it is like to be lied to by first placing the reader in the perspective of the one being misled and then later revealing to the reader the untruthfulness of what was said earlier.
The concept of religion is another major theme of “Lapvona.” The village’s power figures use religion to deceive the villagers, with the poor even justifying their suffering with their religious beliefs. Moshfegh also touches on growth and change in spirituality, with some of her characters undergoing drastic changes in their beliefs as their lives are turned upside down. The characters in “Lapvona” all hold different relationships towards religion, and Moshfegh’s exploration of different characters’s perspectives enables a multifaceted view of religion to be developed. For example, the narrative goes into a great deal of detail on how the servants and villagers, particularly Marek and Jude, grapple with religion. However, the story could go further in exploring how those in power, such as Villiam and Father Barnabas, square their beliefs with their actions.
Plot and character shortcomings notwithstanding, “Lapvona” is very well-written. Moshfegh uses many short, direct sentences to build up longer, descriptive, action driven sequences, giving the writing a lyrical quality and an elegant sense of rhythm. The novel touches on the supernatural by including vague descriptions of magic and witchcraft and pushes the boundaries of what is comfortable. It contains many morally abhorrent moments that are extremely hard to read, but Moshfegh manages to pull it off with her tactful style. “Lapvona” creates a deeply compelling world with relatable issues, which makes it well worth the read.

After the 2021 release of her debut novel “The Wolf and the Woodsman,” Ava Reid has returned with the gothic fantasy-horror standalone “Juniper & Thorn.” Set in the world of “The Wolf and the Woodsman,” “Juniper & Thorn” is a fairytale, but not in the way that Disney has led one to expect. Instead, Reid’s novel expertly crafts a world of monsters and monstrous men to explore the consequences of patriarchy and trauma.
The novel is a loose retelling of “The Juniper Tree,” one of the Brothers’ Grimm most gruesome fairytales, in which an evil stepmother tricks her husband into unknowingly eating his own son for dinner. While the plot of “Juniper & Thorn” bears little resemblance to the original fairytale, it retains the grisly heart of the story. “Juniper & Thorn” is wickedly gory and revels in its more nightmarish aspects. What else could you expect from a novel whose source material is a story about cannibalism?
The novel follows Marlinchen and her two sisters, who live sequestered away from the rapidly industrializing city of Oblya. Locked in their home by their authoritarian wizard father, the three sisters are forced to use their magical abilities for money to feed themselves and their father, who has been cursed with perpetual hunger. When the sisters sneak into the city one night, Marlinchen meets Sevas, a ballet dancer with whom she quickly falls in love. But a murderous monster roaming through the city makes the outside world dangerous, and Marlinchen has to find a way to stop the killings before it’s too late.
The immersive setting of “Juniper & Thorn” is a standout. By setting the novel in Oblya, an Eastern European-inspired city where magic is being pushed out by science and technology, Reid creates a compelling universe populated with witches, wizards, and mythological creatures. The setting of “Juniper & Thorn” makes its horror sequences even more striking, as readers’ vision of a fairytale world is punctured by scenes of violence and death.
Another strength lies in the novel’s main character. Marlinchen is a convincing protagonist, although she’s not necessarily a standard heroine. For most of the novel, Marlinchen is not an active character. While her passivity might be frustrating to the reader, Reid does well in making her lack of resistance understandable and sympathetic in the context of the repressive world in which she lives. Marlinchen is portrayed as a victim of Oblya’s patriarchal society, and her perspective is an intriguing one from which to experience the story. “I would smile blithely if someone tried to saw off my leg,” Marlinchen narrates. “But no one had ever told me that I was allowed to scream.”
Perhaps most importantly, “Juniper & Thorn” offers a nuanced criticism of how patriarchal structures enable violence against women. Throughout the novel, Marlinchen is constantly seen by her father, her clients, and even herself as an object to be used by the men around her. Because of this, her self-objectification permeates the novel’s narrative style. This makes for a somewhat unsettling read, as the reader’s understanding of Marlinchen — as a young person unjustly robbed of her agency — conflicts with the unforgiving way that she views herself. For the most part, Reid handles this well and navigates this uncomfortable perspective with the necessary compassion and skill.
One minor issue with the novel is that while Marlinchen is the most compelling character, the side characters sometimes fall flat in comparison. In particular, Marlinchen’s two sisters are rather one-dimensional. Sevas also lacks some complexity, and Marlinchen’s romance with him isn’t entirely convincing. This, however, is only one small weak spot in the otherwise complex world that Reid has created.
“Juniper & Thorn” is a fairytale with teeth. Reid expertly strips back the skin of the world she has created to reveal its blood and guts, both literally and figuratively. Ultimately, “Juniper & Thorn” is well worth the read for anyone looking for a vividly written and darkly horrific fantasy story.

The sound of laughter almost never fills me with cold, debilitating anger. But the screeches of overconfident amusement bellowing from my peers as we processed Will Smith confronting Chris Rock’s insensitive joke at the Academy Awards did just that. Instead of yelling, I shook my head, desperately trying to dispel what my voice longed to say: Please stop and have some empathy.
I am sorry for writing this piece. I cannot imagine millions of people mischaracterizing and dehumanizing my name — my life — all without my knowledge or permission. For contributing to this toxic culture, I am guilty. But to me this is ultimately about more than Will Smith and Chris Rock. It’s about how people of color are expected to stay dignified, regardless of the personal slights hurled their way; the moment they decide to express the anger that is rightfully theirs, they are vilified, disregarded, and laughed at. And I am so sick of it.
This sickness stems from my youth, when I promised myself I would break unjust rules and incite social change. My naive heart broke when my dad followed my declarations with what I now recognize as wise advice. Pick your battles. Yelling at the racist man at the diner who slams a door in your face won’t make a difference. But it can ruin your reputation, and somewhere down the line, you’re going to need it for something that can make a difference.
It’s why schools all too often teach us about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. but not Malcolm X. In the vital fight for justice, only ideas reframed as palatable are revered in the mainstream.
I can’t and won’t speak for all people of color. I speak only from my experiences as a mixed, brown girl, who took her dad’s words to heart. Since that day, my reputation has been my primary concern, keeping me from breaking even the smallest of norms.
When I listened to Smith’s carefully chosen words, I saw a man who was tired. Tired of constantly having to smile and laugh. Someone who has painted himself as a respectable artist, starring in innocent comedies like “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” or “Men in Black.” And who has dedicated himself for over two decades to using his untainted reputation to share the stories of inspiring Black men like Muhammad Ali, Chris Gardner, and most recently, Richard Williams, in a performance that earned him his first Academy Award.
But the Academy Awards have historically not been receptive of Black artists, regardless of their talent. For Smith, this was a battle he saw worth fighting. In 2016, Will and Jada-Pinkett Smith both boycotted the Academy Awards in protest of the lack of diversity in the acting nominees.
We witnessed powerful stories in film this year. Those of us who watched with an open heart and active ear could not have missed the limited but significant presence of Black artists. As I did my best to drown out the uproar pouring out from my peers as they scrambled to rewatch the clip, I took in Questlove’s acceptance speech for his documentary “Summer of Soul” and gratefully teared up at his words of its cultural importance. While the wails of laughter increased when Smith finally got his moment on stage, my respect for him only soared.
I saw a Black man who had to fight — possibly by not fighting — in order to get to where he is today. A man who believes so much in his work. A man who values his family. A man who expressed in his speech how disturbing it is to be in the public eye. He does not deserve an audience that will only remember him for picking a battle they deemed inappropriate, refusing to acknowledge the depth of his career and life.
People of color are exhausted for so many reasons. And if Oscars-night showed me anything, it’s that we have reason to be. We could live our entire lives with the best of intentions, gain the respect of the entire world, and finally win the award we deserve — not to mention an award symbolizing the impact of the story we truly longed to tell. And in an instant, we may become a laughing stock simply because of a choice to express a perfectly natural human response: anger. We’re not allowed to say we’ve had enough. We’re not permitted a breaking point.
I still believe in the words my father told me, and have abandoned all hope of changing the world. I have no harsh feelings towards those I shared Oscars night with. They struck me as perfectly well-intentioned, kind people whom I would never even think to call bigoted, and I am honored to know a few of them. But I hope, if nothing else, that those who chose to laugh at Smith in his most vulnerable moment will recognize that they were unintentionally laughing at every person of color who ever dared to be human.

“You are the hero of your own story.”
It’s a quote that I loved and would requote often enough that my best friend thought I was the one who came up with it. Though Joseph Campbell said it first, my main character charisma characterizes the way I live my life because as I’ve alluded to in a past op-ed, it’s a trait that I believe I owe to my ADHD. 
It’s a trait that I pride myself on, and one that allowed me to become fast friends with Seo “Ryu” Ryu, Ewha Womans University ’23, through a virtual conference. As our hour-plus-long call deep-diving into ADHD was winding down, I asked her if there were traits or aspects of her ADHD that she appreciated. She was glad I had asked, because if I didn’t, “We would only be talking bad about ADHD,” which, as she says, “is so not true.”
Neurodiversity Celebration Week was merely a few weeks ago, and April is Autism Acceptance Month with April 2nd marking World Autism Awareness Day. It’s within this context that I want to take the time and space in my column to shed light on positive aspects, traits, and experiences with neurodivergence.
As an important disclaimer, this piece is not meant to romanticize neurodivergence nor speak for the multitudes of identities and experiences that neurodivergence, or even more broadly, that neurodiversity encompasses. Rather, I want to provide more holistic insights into neurodivergent experiences, especially because my column has largely focused on challenges and obstacles neurodivergent individuals face.
Even within my own experiences, as someone with an ADHD and anxiety comorbidity, while I see my ADHD as a core part of who I am, I most definitely would not say the same for my anxiety, though I understand them both as contributing to my neurodivergence.
“I love your analogy, like you said, we're the main characters in the TV show,” Ryu tells me. To quote her, we both “always have something to talk about” and hear from our friends regularly that our lives are so dramatic, to which Ryu and I respond, “I know!” I love to joke with my friends that I handle mundane problems in “creative” ways because truly every moment in my life feels so important, that it’s practically cinematic — plenty of material for a sitcom and a stand-up special to boot.
After joking about how she once read ADHD described as “being high all of the time,” Ryu describes what she appreciates about ADHD, “We can find beauty in everything.” People with ADHD, she says, “see some – I don’t know,  leaf, and then we just appreciate it so much.” She adds: “The emotion we feel is a lot more exaggerated than how other people feel, and the ADHD people tend to have a very strong creative side.” For Ryu, this creativity is channeled into a variety of areas, including her passion for art.
“It's like a coin. [ADHDers] appreciate everything, and they feel the beauty around them too much. And that really helps them with the creative side.” But “whenever the negative emotions come by, they’re blaming themselves or maybe [experiencing] depression. It also hits really strong. But it's so fun!” Ryu summarizes. The rollercoaster that is ADHD has brought us to countless interests, which as I know for me, are related to my hyperfixations, and, we’ve both found ways to hack traits like ADHD hyperfocus towards our own successes.
The constant quest for the next interest, the next challenge is a trait that Arash Oboodi ’22 and current GSAS Ph.D. student can relate to. “When I feel like I've accomplished something, my mind immediately wants to try something else because, like I said, I'm hyper-competitive and I'm always looking for a challenge. And when I'm not being challenged, I'm just incredibly bored.”
Oboodi, who has Asperger Syndrome and ADHD is extraordinarily talented in a variety of areas including math, pattern recognition, and poker. From a young age, he has been obsessed with math and patterns, which has helped hone his world-class poker skills. To scratch the surface of his poker accomplishments, he’s had a few instances where he was the number one online poker player in the world and has won the Full Tilt Online Poker Series, the Inaugural Event for just under $200,000 when he was 21, launching him to the top at the time.
Oboodi’s journey with poker is simply a legendary one. He began playing the game at 16 years old, illegally for money back when ID verification wasn’t around yet.
“When poker became mainstream, my brother started playing as a senior in high school and I, like every other little sibling, tried to emulate everything he did. So I picked up the game as well. And coincidentally and conveniently enough, the game was just all about quick math, pattern recognition, some intuition — and also it gave me an opportunity to have fun and compete.” Moreover, he describes the game as incredibly convenient for him because, at the time, he had panic disorder with agoraphobia, which limited his ability to go outside. Thus, poker gave him “an opportunity to make money without having to get a traditional job at a time where [he] didn't know whether [his] condition would improve.”
“Once you get used to the game, honestly the math becomes second nature,” he tells me. “It's all about picking up patterns at that point, like what would Person X do in this situation? What would person Y do in this situation?” Accordingly, he believes that “many intangibles” of poker “correlate with the core symptoms of Asperger's especially,” and would “definitely attribute some of [his] success in poker to the symptoms affiliated with Asperger's.”
As you may have picked up from my column, Harvard is, in a sense, as Oboodi explains, “a haven for neurodivergence. I say that despite the fact that a lot of the students here are probably undiagnosed and are neurodivergent in their own right, whether they just don't care to know or whether they're just unfamiliar with it.”
It’s all the more reason why your understanding and empathy towards everyone is crucial towards fostering both acceptance of neurodiversity and an even better Harvard community.
After all, we’re all entitled to being the heroes of our own stories. Maybe, in both big and small ways, we can be each other’s heroes too.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
So, you’ve been Quadded — and remain unimpressed, despite their cute ‘pfishbowls,’ or perhaps because you realized it’s not actually quite as close as Mather House. Luckily, you can simply transfer houses and pray that the river gods look favorably upon you this time — just kidding. The interhouse transfer process is notoriously opaque and temperamental, with the College providing very little specific or quantified information on the number, direction, or cause of transfers. Not to mention, by applying for a transfer, students jeopardize at least a year’s worth of social connections and relationships.
Given these difficulties, why do our peers continue apply for transfers — and in even larger numbers than before?
The truth, in our view, is that where you live matters. Houses and their immediate surroundings do not simply exist for aesthetic reasons (no, not even Eliot). They overwhelmingly shape our experiences and relationships during our last three years at Harvard — which is why we insist that every student deserves to find a home in their House.
On the surface, traditions like Housing Day are meant to foster a sense of community and House pride. Waking up at the crack of dawn to paint our faces, putting on ridiculous House mascot costumes that we’re honestly not sure have ever been washed, and marching into the Yard with homemade posters as tourists in Harvard Square stare on — all to boost House spirit and morale.
What rarely makes the front page, though, are the genuine fears and occasional loud sobs that erupt in first-year dorms when freshmen are placed into a House that they can’t envision as their home. These students are essentially left out of something special after receiving news that could dictate a significant portion of their undergraduate experience.
For many students who live in the Quad, their Housing Days were plagued with discussions of dreaded stereotypes, their introduction to their house tainted by stress — even if they themselves, like many Quadlings, would eventually grow to love the commuter’s life. Indeed, while the University keeps a tight grip on official transfer statistics, anecdotal accounts suggest that more Quadlings seeming willing to subject themselves to the emotional turmoil of this opaque process each year. Quad housing, for whatever reason, is not seen as equal by significant fraction of our peers.
To be clear, we know well that all 12 Houses are capable of being loved. For many, if not most, Quadded students, their House does become a deeply-cherished home, one they will defend to any and all detractors. But that’s not a reason to ignore the clear need for a morale boost suggested by the growing transfer numbers. They make it imperative that Harvard direct resources towards making material improvements to the Quad that can help Quadlings learn to love their Houses.
These investments should seek to improve all of the various aspects of House life that contribute to a student’s sense of House pride. That might entail expediting renovations through the House renewal program in Quad houses, giving greater funding for social events through House Committees, improving service from the Quad shuttle system, and even building on the small, thoughtful gestures like dining-hall ice cream sundae bars that make Houses feel special.
So long as different houses are deemed unequal, the option of transferring remains an important outlet for student dissatisfactions that must therefore be open, accessible, transparent, and fair. At the very least, Housing Administrators should be more transparent about the number of openings in each House, so that students can rank their options accordingly and thereby maximize their odds of a successful transfer.
Most importantly, we believe that the interhouse transfer process should not remain “impartial” — that all transfer requests are not created equal and should not be treated as such. For some, an interhouse transfer is a matter of safety — an incredibly high-stakes decision brought on by Title IX issues, accessibility concerns, or interpersonal issues like discriminatory or bigoted behavior. For others, it is about avoiding the inconvenience of waking up extra early to commute to a 9 a.m. lecture, a genuine but assuredly less severe issue.
In recognition of this hierarchy of complaints, the College should create an option on the standard transfer application for students to list compelling issues with greater detail and subsequently prioritize them in making decisions on who will be allowed to transfer. This adjustment seems to us particularly important in light of Harvard’s own recognition that many barriers and deterrents discourage students from bringing forward formal complaints against the conduct of other students. Given these issues, it is urgent and necessary for the College to at least protect these students by prioritizing their transfer applications while working to improve the status quo of silence and inaction. After all, how can interhouse transfer effectively resolve student dissatisfaction with their Houses when it has not even begun to address concerns of student safety and well-being?
Ultimately, we maintain that all Houses, Quad or river, can be lovely homes. We also know that sometimes, things just don’t work out. That’s okay — but only as long as the College fulfills its obligations to support unsatisfied students through housing improvements and a better transfer system.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After months of impasse, Harvard security guards voted last week to ratify a contract offer from Securitas, which employs around 300 contracted security workers who are stationed across the school.
Union members voted 122-101 to accept Securitas’ latest offer, ending a prolonged labor dispute that at points pitted workers against the leadership of their own union, 32BJ Service Employees International Union. Guards voted down a previous contract offer earlier this year.
The contract — which will run through November 2025 — introduces pay raises for all guards, with higher increases for more senior-level guards. Under the new deal, guards will be able to carry over unused personal days from the previous year. It will also make Juneteenth a paid holiday and establish a Labor Management Committee to address work-related issues.
Around 74 percent of union members turned out to vote in the election.
The results came despite opposition from some members of the union’s eight-person bargaining committee, which is elected to represent general members in negotiations. Some on the committee called on workers to vote “no,” hoping to get a better offer.
Bargaining committee member Arun K. Malik denounced the contract offer as a tactic designed to pit union members against one another by stratifying wages within a tiered framework. He said the proposal to pay higher-level guards more money encouraged them to vote in favor of the deal, without regard for some of their colleagues.
“It’s unfortunate that Securitas put forth a union-busting proposal that will guarantee that the union will be divided for the next four years,” Malik said Monday.
Securitas did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday night.
Union members who voted “yes” on the new contract said they saw the offer from Securitas as a significant improvement from the previous one, which was rejected in January.
Union member Aldilcon C. Andrade said that he was “very happy” about the new deal.
“Last time I did vote no, but when they gave the new proposal, I voted yes immediately because the raise is really significant,” he said.
“I just had a newborn baby, so this contract is really great because my child also gets free health care,” he added.
Kumar S. Dangi, a member of 32BJ’s bargaining committee, said “lingering” without a contract any longer would “jeopardize our members.”
“You should not be that greedy,” he added. “You have to get it done.”
Roxana Rivera, the executive vice president of 32BJ SEIU, said that the contract offer represents “the best that we could achieve in this bargaining cycle.”
“We do believe it’s a strong agreement for our members. It protects their health care, it gives them well-deserved wage increases, and there’s even some new benefits in this agreement,” she said.
Malik said guards may still demonstrate around Commencement, when massive crowds are expected to flood Cambridge for two ceremonies that will honor Harvard’s Class of 2022 and the Classes of 2021 and 2020, respectively.
“I believe the bargaining committee is still not happy,” he said. “But of course, we’re going to have to wait another four years before we can reopen several issues.”

As war continues to rage in Ukraine, Harvard affiliates praised the selection of Moldovan President Maia Sandu to deliver the Harvard Kennedy School’s graduation address in May.
Moldova, a poor and small Eastern European country bordering Ukraine, has taken in over 100,000 refugees since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine in February, despite having a population of less than 3 million. Sandu, who rode a pro-European Union and pro-democracy platform to win the presidential election in 2020, has led Moldovan efforts to provide humanitarian aid to those affected by the war.
Mariana Budjeryn, a Ukrainian research associate at the Kennedy School’s Belfer Center, pointed to U.S. President Joe Biden's promise to accept 100,000 refugees, calling it "incommensurable" for the United States and Moldova — a country one hundred times smaller — to welcome the same number of people.
“It’s an important story to tell the American people,” Ilinca Mazureac ’23, a Moldovan student. “That a country like Moldova, who's arguably one of the poorest countries in Europe, can take in so many refugees, and can find a place for them to live.”
“If Moldova can do that, it should be a lot easier for the U.S. to do that,” Mazureac added.
Ilya S. Timtchenko, a U.S. citizen of Ukrainian background and chair of the Ukrainian Caucus at HKS, said Sandu’s speech will hold “symbolic significance,” due to the leader’s long-standing solidarity with Ukraine.
HKS spokesperson James F. Smith wrote in a statement that the Kennedy School invited Sandu before the invasion of Ukraine.
“Clearly, her leadership since then makes it all the more appropriate for Kennedy School students to hear from her,” Smith wrote.
Mihaela Esanu ’23, a Moldovan student, said that both Ukraine and Moldova have struggled with “Russian aggression” since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
“One of the reasons why there was so much solidarity among Moldovans [was] because we related to Ukrainians,” Esanu said. “It was on a lot of Moldovan people’s minds that ‘Oh, it could have been us, and that it might still be us.’”
“That is not to say that Moldovans are going through what Ukrainians are now,” Esanu added. “But I think our similarities are anchored in a somewhat shared past.”
Budjeryn said she hopes Sandu’s graduation speech will remind HKS graduates of their own democratic values.
“As a Ukrainian, I hope these public policy leaders will be reinvigorated with some healthy dose of idealism about their own values,” Budjeryn said. “Or the values that their own country upholds, or claims to uphold.”
“We have somehow lost sight of the fact that these values are not something that belongs to the West exclusively,” Budjeryn added. “There’s something universal about wanting to have agency and to live with a voice in a political society.”
Budjeryn said the solidarity Eastern European countries are showing with Ukraine reminded her of the Kennedy School’s motto: “Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.”
“Maybe it’s not just so nationally focused,” she said. “Maybe it’s, ‘What you can do — not just for the country — but what you can do for the world to make it better.’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At Tuesday’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences meeting, Harvard faculty are set to vote on two controversial proposals — one that would allow students to pursue double concentrations and another that would replace shopping week with previous-term registration.
In September, the Office of Undergraduate Education created a subcommittee to prepare a proposal for introducing double concentrations. In December, an FAS committee recommended that Harvard College swap out shopping week for previous-term registration, in which students would register for courses one semester in advance. Last month’s FAS meeting was the first time the full faculty discussed these issues.
Many faculty have expressed their support for the adoption of double concentrations. Currently, students may only pursue joint concentrations that culminate in an interdisciplinary thesis.
Art, Film, and Visual Studies professor and Director of Undergraduate Studies Matthew Saunders ’97 said he believes double concentrations would better allow students to explore diverse academic interests.
“So many people are interested in engaging with the sort of courses that we do across film and visual arts, and it’s often hard to figure out how to make it fit,” he said. “There’s a burden on the joint concentration to do a joint thesis.”
Computer Science professor and Director of Undergraduate Studies Boaz Barak wrote in an emailed statement that though undergraduates have produced meaningful theses in the department, students should not be required to complete a joint thesis if they are not intellectually interested in combining the two fields.
“I expect that most students that wish to combine C.S. with another field would continue to prefer a joint concentration to a double one,” he wrote. “However, I believe a student should only do a thesis if they are driven to it intellectually, and not to satisfy some administrative requirement.”
Kathy A. Richman, director of undergraduate studies and lecturer in Romance Languages and Literatures, wrote in an emailed statement that the “only disadvantage” she sees in double concentrations is that they would increase the total required credits for students.
Fulfilling the requirements for two complete concentrations in addition to General Education courses and distribution requirements would leave a student with less room in their schedule to explore other fields, she wrote.
When it comes to the fate of shopping week, faculty opinions are split.
During the pandemic, the College established a pre-term registration model with an add-drop period at the start of the semester. Under the new proposal, students would be required to select their courses during the previous semester.
Richman wrote that she believes the add-drop period is a suitable substitute for shopping week.
“In effect, I don’t believe that Harvard undergrads are really ‘losing’ shopping week,” she wrote. “The add-drop period at the beginning of term serves the same purpose of being able to explore a reasonable number of courses. It would be helpful if the new system allowed students to pre-register for 5 courses.”
Barak wrote that he sees advantages in both pre-registration and shopping week, but that the school must get “the details right.” Faculty should prepare course materials in time for students to make informed decisions, students should still be able to switch courses without petitions during the first week, and students should have a say in the proposal’s implementation, he wrote.
In a letter sent to The Crimson and signed by 36 faculty and alumni, Harvard Kennedy School fellow Richard Yarrow and Ph.D. candidate in Government Max Kuhelj Bugarič ’19 voiced concerns about an early course registration system.
“The liberal arts model’s interweaving of disciplines and ideas functions best when students are encouraged to explore interesting topics freely and make connections between different fields on their own,” the letter states. “We believe that too many of that model’s benefits will be lost under the new system.”
The statement claims that shopping period provides students with the opportunity to explore unknown fields with unfamiliar professors and allows them to decide their courses after seeing their instructors “in action” rather than the “rumors and imperfect ratings of the Q.”

Acknowledging that Harvard had to adapt during the pandemic, the letter calls the move away from shopping week “bizarre,” arguing that course shopping is “likely the single most Zoom-appropriate of all of Harvard’s traditions.”
The letter urges the College to re-adopt shopping period.
“We hope that Harvard College will quickly return to and maintain a highly flexible, open, intellectually dynamic course enrollment system, a key and underappreciated foundation that made Harvard’s liberal arts model thrive,” it states.
One of the signatories of the statement, Physics professor and Director of Undergraduate Studies Howard M. Georgi ’68, penned his own letter opposing pre-registration, arguing that shopping week is a “unique and valuable part of Harvard College.”
“We don’t have cookie-cutter students and we don’t teach cookie-cutter courses,” he wrote. “It is important for students to get a sense of how the professor teaches and the feel of the class, staff and students, and that simply cannot be done the semester before.”
Though Georgi said shopping week “adds to the chaos of the first few weeks,” he wrote that Harvard should try out other solutions before taking the “drastic step” of requiring pre-registration.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment.
At Tuesday’s meeting, the faculty will vote on the broad principles of early registration. If the proposal is adopted, an implementation committee will then decide the specifics, according to Computer Science professor Edward W. “Eddie” Kohler.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard affiliates signed a letter released in March demanding that British and American universities stop accepting funding from fossil fuel corporations for climate change and energy research.
Fossil Free Research — a campaign started by Cambridge Climate Justice, Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard, and climate change experts — penned the letter, which argues climate research funded by the fossil fuel industry “creates a conflict of interest that compromises researchers’ academic freedom.”
Among the nearly 500 academics who signed the letter, 91 were Harvard affiliates.
Ilana A. Cohen ’23, an FFDH organizer who also helped with disseminating the letter, explained that the goal of the campaign was to argue for the university’s responsibility, as “true climate leaders,” to ban funding from the fossil fuel industry.
“It really powerfully argues the case that universities — in order to be true climate leaders — simply have to ban fossil fuel money for climate change, environmental, and energy policy research,” Cohen said.
Several academics agreed on the need for a ban. Peter C. Frumhoff, an associate with the Harvard University Center for the Environment and signatory of the letter, accused fossil fuel companies of spreading disinformation while "promoting their continued exploration of venues of oil and gas."
"I don't have any doubt that researchers today and universities today that are currently accepting fossil fuel money to support their climate-energy research have the best of intentions in their work," Frumhoff said. "The problem is that getting support from the fossil fuel industry entirely undermines the goal of supporting a clean energy transition."
Harvard Art Museums’ Curator Carmen Àrnold-Biucchi, who also signed the letter, wrote in an email that the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, a top exporter of oil, increased her support for fossil fuel divestment.
"Not only is it devastating for the earth and the climate, but with the present war in Ukraine, we see that fossil fuel finances Putin’s war," she wrote.
Similarly, Harvard Graduate School of Education professor Emmerich Davies drew parallels between sports and the fossil fuel industry.
“The men’s soccer World Cup in Qatar is a very clear example of the use of sports to whitewash problems with the staging of the tournament and human rights abuses in the country,” he said. “I don’t think we as academics should give the fossil fuel companies the opportunity to do something similar by greenwashing their reputation by funding research on climate change.”
Harvard Medical School assistant professor, climate activist, and signatory James M. “Jim” Recht said he thinks the fossil fuel industry has offered funding to researchers to assuage any misgivings about the industry. He said he has seen first-hand how the money has “distorted” the perspectives of colleagues.
“If you give someone or some entity enough money, it makes it very difficult for that entity or that individual to continue to behave in a morally right way,” he said. “They know this, and they capitalize that because they have virtually unlimited amounts of money and power.”
Recht said fossil fuel divestment will help individuals realize the funds are “morally repugnant.” He stressed that the sooner universities “wash their hands” of fossil fuel industry money, the sooner they will be able to build “democratic, equitable energy infrastructures."
Harvard, in a policy reversal, announced last September that it would let its remaining investments in the fossil fuel industry expire, though the University did not provide a timeline for the liquidation.
Cohen said the Fossil Free Research campaign has sent Harvard’s administration the letter and hopes that Harvard will take action.
“I’m really optimistic that this letter will further the momentum around getting the administration to actually be accountable on the issue of fossil fuel money and conflicts of interest because we have yet to see any accountability there,” Cohen said.
Recht added that he believes Harvard has been behind in facing the political and economic challenges of the climate crisis.
“Harvard’s role so far has been to exemplify frailty and the moral weakness of large, influential institutions,” Recht said.
“Harvard has said to people like me for the past 10 years, ‘we are not interested in tampering with the status quo.’ And I hope that changes,” he added.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment.

Eight published articles — including two full studies and six abstracts — co-authored by a former Harvard Medical School professor, Jorge G. Arroyo, have been retracted in recent months by the medical journals that published them.
Three different journals retracted Arroyo’s research, which was conducted over three years at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, an HMS teaching hospital.
The retractions came due to noncompliance with an institutional review board. Under federal guidelines, IRBs have the power to approve, modify, or reject study protocols using a group review process.
Last month, two journals — Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science and Translational Vision Science & Technology — retracted a total of six abstracts and one full article on which Arroyo was listed as a co-author. Both journals cited “a serious issue related to lack of Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval for the research procedures.”
A third journal — Clinical & Experimental Ophthalmology — retracted an additional full study in February. In its retraction notice, the journal’s editorial board wrote that the “retraction has been agreed following confirmation by the corresponding author that the study procedures deviated from the human research ethics approval received for the research.”
Arroyo, who formerly served as an associate professor of Ophthalmology at HMS, did not respond to requests for comment on Monday. He told the Boston Globe, “It’s a complicated issue, and all I can say is people make mistakes.”
He wrote in a later statement to the Globe that the studies were retracted “as part of my cooperation with the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center during their review of this matter.”
Arroyo currently works as an eye surgeon at Boston Vision, a Massachusetts-based eye care practice. He has authored and published more than 60 peer-reviewed papers, according to his biography on Boston Vision’s website. He is board certified by the American Academy of Ophthalmology and serves on the finance committee of the New England Ophthalmological Society.
Boston Vision did not respond to requests for comment.
One of the studies Arroyo co-authored measured retinal blood flow from 20 control subjects and 32 clinically diagnosed patients. Another collected data from 18 patients with “dry age-related macular degeneration,” an ocular disorder.
Another study — one of the six published by Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science — performed Optical Coherence Technology scans of 46 patients recruited from the BIDMC Eye Clinic. According to the study’s abstract, scans were taken before and after subjects were administered oxygen for 3 hours.
Arroyo left his position at BIDMC in 2021, according to his LinkedIn page.
BIDMC declined to comment on the specific retractions.
“We are fully committed to upholding the highest research standards and to rigorously maintaining the integrity of our research,” a spokesperson for the hospital, Terri Janos, wrote in a statement. “Any concerns brought to our attention are thoroughly reviewed in accordance with institutional policies and applicable regulations.”

The men’s lacrosse team (7-1, 2-0) remains a member of the top 10 of Division 1 after clinching the no. 10 ranking for the second week in a row after a 7-6 victory over Colgate. This matchup marks the sixth straight win for the Crimson.
The contest was low-scoring and competitive from the initial whistle. Colgate drew first blood with a quick goal, to which Harvard responded with a series of six straight goals.
The game was not a showing of the team’s usual cohesive play as it was somewhat sloppy on both ends. The team had a combined twenty turnovers and was 0-2 in man-up play. However, the squad had a successful day on clearing, going 22-24 and was able to scoop up 31 ground balls.
The face off was an improved showing from previous games, with senior fogos Steven Cuccurullo and Kyle Massimilian going 7-12 and 2-2 respectively. The wings played an integral role in securing possession, with sophomore LSM Greg Campisi, first year LSM Martin Nelson, junior middie Chase Yager, and first-year middie Andrew O’Berry all scooping up ground balls that resulted in possession time for the offense.
“It’s focus, taking more live reps in practice We switched from doing drills on our own to more head to head, which definitely contributed to our success,” Massimilian said. “[We need to win more] clean, and if we don’t win it clean outright, then move to a counter immediately. Our wings do an amazing job of getting wins for us. Picking up ground balls ourselves and then generating offense off of that. Looking to push transition when we win the face off.”
On the attacking end, the trio of senior Austin Madronic, junior Hayden Cheek and first-year Sam King facilitated the sets. Cheek tallied two goals and two ground balls, and King notched one goal and three groundbals.
The ride, which included the hustle of middies like junior Nick Loring, first-year Owen Gaffney who had three points (1G, 2A) and four ground balls, first-year Andrew Perry and junior Isaiah Dawson slowed down Colgate’s clear and resulted in caused turnovers that awarded Harvard’s offense with more possession time.
“We were being patient on offense. We were getting good looks. We were sharing the ball well, ” Gaffney noted.
The first three quarters showcased a dominant Crimson attack, but the fourth quarter showed a lapse in concentration that saw Colgate score four straight goals to tighten Harvard’s lead to one. Senior goalie Kyle Mullin came in clutch at the buzzer when he made a save on the doorstep.
“We kept giving them loose balls. We weren’t getting ground balls a lot, so we were giving them a lot of chances that were kind of unorganized, so we couldn’t get set up” Campisi said. “And we weren’t helping the slide. We were kind of sliding and leaving the guy wide open every time, which we were doing well on in the first half.”
There is a lot that the team needs to work on to improve for difficult future contests against league competitors Cornell, UPenn, Princeton and Yale. Gaffney gave insight into how the team will look to perform more cohesively offensively, while Campisi had notes for his fellow defensemen.
“[We need to] keep working on spacing. A lot of the times when we turned it over, missed catches, stuff like that, we were too condensed. We need to space out more cause we find success in space and we are not utilizing all of it. We played a good game, but every game we are going to have to learn to do something better,” Gaffney stated.
Campisi hopes to continue this trend of gradual improvement on the defensive end with increased communication.
“We need to look to communicate better. We started off really well on the same page, so we just have to keep it up for the whole game. We guarded well and our slide decisions themselves were good, we helped a lot at the right times.”
The Crimson will travel to Ithaca, NY to battle against Cornell for a 3pm game that will be available to stream on ESPN+.

This past weekend, Harvard women’s water polo competed in an exciting double header against a pair of conference opponents on Saturday, with a narrow two-point loss to No. 7 Michigan and an equally hard-fought two-point victory over No. 19 Princeton.
“[Michigan and Princeton] were definitely our two most anticipated games of the season,” junior goalie Zoe Banks said. “They’re the two teams we’ve been chasing for the longest, so it was really exciting to play two really close games against them.”
The No. 22 Crimson (17-5, 5-2 CWPA) began the day with a 12-10 defeat against the Wolverines (18-8, 6-0 CWPA), which is currently undefeated in conference play. Harvard came out of the gates slowly, conceding two goals in the first two minutes.
“We started off a little slow,” Banks said. “Next time, we know what to expect and we know we have to come out with ten times the amount of energy that we did in the first quarter of that game.”
Despite the difficult start and eventual defeat, both the players and head coach Ted Minnis saw the game as a success. Both emphasized the importance of learning from setbacks while still focusing on the positives and keeping a good attitude.
“Personally, my favorite moment from the whole day was against Michigan,” said senior center defender Inde Halligan. “It was a six-on-five, so we had a power play going, and my teammate [first-year attacker Erin Kim] threw me the most perfect pass that has ever been thrown in water polo, which ended up setting up a really nice shot for me.”
After the Michigan game, the team shifted its focus to its Ivy League rival, Princeton. For double headers, being able to reset mentally and prepare for the second opponent is critical to maintain a high level of play. However, it can be a daunting task.
“I definitely was nervous to have two games in the same day, there’s always the chance of having your mind on the second game and not playing the first game right,” Halligan said. “It’s hard to deal with them separately.”
On Saturday, the Crimson succeeded in moving past the Michigan loss in order to focus all its efforts on the Tigers.
“We are moving on to the next game, [the first] game is finished. There’s nothing to be done about it and there’s no point in thinking too hard about any negatives you might feel,” Banks said. “Stick with the positive energy … take the positive things from the first game and bring them into the next one.”
That positive energy from the Michigan game carried over to Harvard’s showdown with Princeton (17-6, 6-1 CWPA), where the Crimson put away a 10-8 win.
“To play and beat Princeton for the first time with 0-4 [against them] as a program, and do it in their senior game – it was pretty great,” Minnis said.
As it did against the Wolverines, Harvard allowed the Tigers to score the game’s first two goals, but after changing the lines and doing some substituting, the team was able to tie up the game at 2-2. The first quarter ended with a frustrating two-goal run by Princeton, but Harvard picked up significant momentum in the second quarter, as it headed into halftime with a 7-4 edge.
“Our second quarter against Princeton was really great,” Banks said. “It was a 5-0 quarter, so that was really exciting, especially since at the end of the first quarter we were down 4-2.”
Though the Princeton game was undoubtedly a success for the Crimson, the team will continue making adjustments before the second round of conference play. The double round robin format means that Harvard plays each conference opponent twice, giving both teams a chance to strategize and hone their play before the second matchup.
“Especially against Michigan, I did not like our five-on-six defense,” Minnis said. “We gave up a lot of goals to both Princeton and Michigan in that phase of the game … When we’re playing down a woman, that’s when teams are scoring on us.”
Minnis declined to comment on specific strategic changes he’ll be making, but noted that the team is always adjusting and will be spending the coming weeks watching film of its games and preparing to face off against Michigan and Princeton again this coming weekend.
The Princeton win left the Crimson with plenty to build off of. It hopes to carry its momentum over to the four conference games this weekend. After its rematch with Princeton on Saturday at 11 a.m., Harvard will face Bucknell (Saturday, 3 p.m.) and Saint Francis (Sunday, 9 a.m.) before attempting to exact revenge on the Wolverines on Sunday at 12 p.m.

Although Disney’s love letter to Colombia, “Encanto,” was released in November 2021, the movie has been taking over social media for months, and you would be of a rare species if you haven’t heard the alluring earworm that is “We Don’t Talk About Bruno.” Here, we’ve assigned an “Encanto” character to each of the Houses, so welcome to the family Madrigal (and the Harvard houses)!
