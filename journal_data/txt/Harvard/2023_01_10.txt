After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amid rising Covid-19 cases in the Boston area, Harvard University Health Services retired its contact tracing team and Crimson Clear application last month, drawing mixed reactions from students.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention designated Cambridge Thursday as being in the “High Covid-19 Community Level” following a rise in Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations. The Boston area has also seen a surge in Covid-19 positivity rates and viral levels in wastewater in the last month.
In an email sent to Harvard affiliates last Thursday, HUHS Executive Director Giang T. Nguyen recommended that affiliates receive the latest booster, mask indoors and on public transportation, wash their hands well, and test immediately after or before arriving on campus. Nguyen also advised those traveling from China, Hong Kong, or Macau to prepare for testing, as required by the CDC.
Before Dec. 22, 2022, students reported Covid-19 symptoms and positive tests through the Crimson Clear application and received instructions on health precautions and isolation procedures from the program.
Harvard’s Crimson Clear program and contact tracing teams are the latest measures to be retired from HUHS, punctuating a year in which Harvard steadily wound down its Covid-19 restrictions.
In January 2022, Harvard ended isolation housing for students who tested positive for Covid-19, and required students to inform close contacts themselves rather than through HUHS's contact tracing team. In May, Harvard stopped requiring regular Covid-19 testing from affiliates and in September, Harvard stopped offering free PCR tests to affiliates.
Harvard still requires that on-campus students receive the latest Covid-19 booster shot.
An HUHS spokesperson wrote in an email that the HUHS website includes guidance for those who test positive for Covid-19. HUHS continues to follow state and local Covid-19 data and is prepared to update Harvard’s guidelines if needed, the spokesperson added.
Still, some students are concerned that with the rollback of Harvard’s Covid-19 precautions, the University is not well-prepared to mitigate the spread of the virus in the spring semester.
“Given the rise in Covid cases, Harvard should not be eliminating its albeit already limited resources,” Melissa Shang ’25 said.
Shang, who has a form of muscular dystrophy, is at increased risk for Covid-19 and said Crimson Clear helped her obtain a Paxlovid prescription after she reported a positive test.
“I think that Harvard is operating under the assumption that given that the new variants are more mild, mass infection is fine, and that it’s just going to be like a cold or like a flu for most students,” Shang said. “However, there are many high-risk students and others who are like me, and Harvard should be ensuring that we have options to keep ourselves safe too.”
Matthew Chang ’23 said Crimson Clear and the contact tracing team provided “peace of mind” that there were protocols in place to prevent people from getting sick and to guide those who do. He added that a more relaxed mindset around Covid-19 would undermine attempts to prevent the spread of the virus.
“I feel like people are already in the mindset of, ‘Covid is not even a real thing anymore,’” Chang said.
Not all students think the retirement of the programs leaves Harvard underprepared. Fred W. Larsen ’24 described the programs’ retirement as “very good,” adding that Covid-19 is “a thing much like the flu that will be going around forever.”
Larsen also lauded the social benefits of reduced Covid-19 precautions.
“Large amounts of in-person socialization is really paramount to the Harvard experience,” Larsen said. “I’m glad that the University has acknowledged that it’s not worth sacrificing in-person social experiences to try to control your exposure to a virus with minimal risks to your health.”
Sebastian R. Feune ’25 said while Harvard has been “able to adapt relatively well” to the Covid-19 pandemic, the contract tracing and self-reporting programs lowered stress by providing guidance to students.
“Knowing Harvard students and how hard they push themselves, it can be daunting to have to deal with potential Covid-19 concerns,” Feune said. “There are people who may feel like this is added stress, and that they have to handle it themselves.”

Demonstrators hold up a hand-painted sign depicting Faisal and posters demanding justice on the lawn in front of City Hall. Over 200 people attended the Monday afternoon protest in response to the Wednesday night fatal shooting of UMass Boston student Sayed Faisal by a Cambridge Police officer.
The event was organized by the Bangladesh Association of New England ahead of Monday's City Council meeting. Pervin A. Chowdhury, the association's president, is pictured here holding the “Speak Up Stand Up” sign. BANE also held an initial rally at City Hall on Thursday afternoon, charging that Faisal’s death was an act of police brutality.
Fatema Ahmad, Executive Director of the Muslim Justice League, called for sustained protest commitment from attendees and bashed the elected officials who she said attempted to reassure her. “We are not here for your bullshit,” she yelled. “We are not here for your promises and your lies.”
General Secretary of the Bangladesh Association of New England Tanvir Murad’s voice broke as he shared the story of “one of our brightest kids” whose family immigrated from Bangladesh in pursuit of the American Dream. “Please stay with the family. Stay with us,” he said.
Pratna Khem, an Asian American Studies instructor at UMass Boston who taught Faisal in one of his final classes, shared some of Faisal’s writing. “Activism is protesting to make a change in society. This kind of change is necessary to make,” Khem read aloud as audience members applauded. “As long as there's a problem in society, there will always be activism.”
Faisal’s closest friend, Amtiaz Uddin, shared fond memories of days spent playing cricket, riding bikes, and going to the gym together, adding that Faisal “would never forget to bring a peanut butter sandwich” for him. “Someone can never hate him,” Uddin said, moments before breaking down in tears. “No one can feel uncomfortable around him.”
Among those in attendance Monday were elderly and children. Speakers called attention to the fact that Faisal was an only child throughout the rally and emphasized that young people of color are subject to heightened, and oftentimes deadly, surveillance measures.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge residents expressed outrage at the fatal shooting of a college student by Cambridge police at Monday’s City Council meeting, an hour after a large protest outside the City Hall.
More than two hours of Cambridge’s City Council meeting Monday revolved around a discussion of last week’s fatal shooting of 20-year-old Sayed Faisal, a Cambridge local and student at the University of Massachusetts Boston. After attendees took turns airing impassioned grievances, city officials, including Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui, offered their condolences.
The shooting of Faisal, a Bangladeshi American, has spiked concerns of racism, Islamophobia, and police brutality throughout Cambridge.
“We’ve heard that Cambridge is special and that our progressive approach to policing sets us apart — that the kind of racist, senseless killings that we read about in places like Ferguson, Minneapolis, and Cleveland could never happen here,” said Cambridge City Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan. “Yet here we are somehow trying to process the reality that a Cambridge Police officer shot and killed a young man from our community while he was experiencing a crisis.”
Siddiqui discussed her personal connection to the death as a South Asian immigrant during the meeting.
“I’ve struggled to find the words to address everyone amidst this tragedy,” Siddiqui said. “As your mayor, as a South Asian immigrant deeply connected to the large Bengali community here in Cambridge, I offer my deepest condolences to the family and friends of Sayed Arif Faisal.”
“I’ve been with the Bengali community during your most joyous moments — graduations, birthday parties, and celebrations at Danehy Park,” she added. “Tonight, I share your distress, your confusion, your pain.”
Faisal’s death marks the first fatal officer-involved shooting by the Cambridge Police Department in more than 20 years, according to CPD spokesperson Jeremy C. Warnick.
Pervin A. Chowdhury, president of the Bangladesh Association of New England, which hosted Monday’s protest and a demonstration last week in response to Faisal’s killing, spoke out on behalf of Faisal’s family.
“Police are supposed to help us, save us – not to kill us,” she said. “So what are you guys gonna do about it?”
Several residents called on the city to reform its policing system, pointing out the disparity in spending on the city’s police department versus its non-police Community Safety Department, which responds to mental health crises and other non-violent emergencies. Cambridge’s fiscal year 2023 budget allocates $2.9 million to the Community Safety Department and $73.5 million to the police.
“Talk is cheap and budgets are where we see actual priorities,” Cambridge resident Itamar Turner-Trauring said.
Louise E. Parker said during the meeting that Cambridge needs an alternative to policing that uses “crisis de-escalation skills, not guns.”
“We need answers as to why multiple police could not handle a single slightly-built young man without killing him,” Parker said. “Because clearly, bringing a gun to what is not even a knife fight — it was a young man harming himself — is not the answer.”
In an emailed statement to The Crimson, Warnick wrote that a current independent investigation by the District Attorney’s office and an inquest process will conclude in the publishing of “a series of public records and documents containing extensive details related to Wednesday’s shooting, including the names of all the responding officers.”
Cambridge Police Commissioner Christine A. Elow shared at Monday’s meeting that this independent judicial inquest into the shooting was underway and promised attendees “a full and transparent investigation.”
“Policing is all about the sanctity of human life,” Elow said. “When a life is lost it is a tragedy on so many levels.”
The city is hosting a “community meeting” on Thursday for residents to meet with District Attorney Marian T. Ryan, Cambridge City Manager Yi-An Huang ’05, and Elow. Siddiqui has also convened a special session of the City Council next Wednesday to discuss CPD protocols.
“This has easily been the most difficult week in my five years on the Council,” Zondervan said. “It’s a dark moment in Cambridge history that we will never forget.”

An outpouring of grief and anger over the fatal police shooting of college student Sayed Faisal swept the steps of Cambridge City Hall Monday as demonstrators demanded answers and reform from officials.
Sayed Faisal, a 20-year-old Cambridge resident and computer engineering student at the University of Massachusetts Boston, was fatally shot Wednesday by a Cambridge Police officer after the department alleged he approached officers wielding a knife. According to a Cambridge Police Department statement on Jan. 4, a 911 caller reported that Faisal appeared to be harming himself, prompting the police pursuit that ended his life.
More than 200 people rallied outside Cambridge City Hall ahead of a contentious City Council meeting defined by questions surrounding Faisal’s death. The Bangladesh Association of New England organized the protest, the second one in a week after Faisal’s death. Several other local advocacy groups supported Monday’s demonstration.
Speakers — which included Faisal’s friends and teachers — yelled chants and reflected on his life, some bursting into tears. Demonstrators waved signs reading “Faisal Needed Help Not Bullets,” “Justice for Faisal,” and “Stop Police Brutality."
Despite calls from residents and local students to identify the officer who opened fire on Faisal, CPD has not released a name. CPD spokesperson Jeremy C. Warnick said Monday that the officer, who was placed on administrative leave after seven years with the department, has never received a complaint.
Faisal’s case has gained international attention. In Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, hundreds of protestors formed a human chain Monday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ahead of the visit of a U.S. national to demand justice for the Bangladeshi American student.
The act spurred the U.S. Embassy in Dhaka to extend its condolences to Faisal’s family. In a Monday statement, U.S. Embassy spokesperson Jeff Ridenour wrote that the Embassy “support[s] calls by the local community and government for a thorough and transparent investigation by the District Attorney’s Office.”
Tahamina Gani, a Cambridge resident for 41 years who lived close to Faisal and often saw him playing sports in the streets, said she attended the City Hall protest to seek answers about his death.
“Why did he die? They only need to shoot his leg,” she said, echoing calls from the rally’s speakers against the use of lethal force by police.
Gani added that Cambridge’s Bangladeshi population is now “sad and crying.”
Fatuma Mohamed, youth advocacy officer for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, read a statement provided by Faisal’s parents, Sayed Mujibullah and Mosammat Shaheda. Faisal — whom they called Prince — was never violent toward others, had no record with law enforcement, and “always made sure that those around him felt appreciated,” they said.
Pervin A. Chowdhury, the president of BANE, begged parents to check on the mental wellbeing of their children and called on protestors to persist in what could be a lengthy battle.
“Please all of you, bear with us,” she said. “It’s not going to end soon.”
Barbara J. Dougan, a legal counsel for Faisal’s family, detailed four aspects of the legal process ahead to deliver “the justice that we’re seeking for Prince,” including an ongoing investigation by the Middlesex District Attorney, an inquest that will be held by the courts, a possible lawsuit from Faisal’s family, and broader systemic changes to policing.
Dougan noted it was possible the inquest may not take place until 2024, eliciting a wave of booing from the crowd.
Suhail P. Purkar, who spoke at the rally on behalf of the Party for Socialism and Liberation, said in an interview with the Crimson that the news of Faisal’s death was “very surreal.”
“I was with the family just a few days ago, and the grief is something that’s very difficult to put into words,” he said. “It’s so overwhelming.”
But Purkar said that Monday’s turnout gave him hope and was an “amazing sight.”
“To see Black, brown, white, Latino, you know, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh — this is exactly the sort of multinational unity that we need to make sure that we get justice for Faisal,” he said.
A string of protests hosted by BANE is set to follow, with the group organizing demonstrations on Jan. 11 in Cambridgeport, Jan. 14 in Harvard Square, and Jan. 21 at the Middlesex County District Attorney’s Office.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Medical School received a $50 million donation from the Cummings Foundation in support of the legacy of the late Paul E. Farmer, the school announced Tuesday.
The gift will establish the Paul Farmer Collaborative between HMS and the University of Global Health Equity in Rwanda. Paid over 10 years, the fund is meant to encourage exploration of social medicine at both institutions with a particular focus on the “development of sustainable and equitable health systems,” according to a press release from HMS.
Specifically, the Paul Farmer Collaborative is meant to support research, clinical training, and the exchange of students and faculty between the two institutions. It will also fund the creation of an annual international conference and workshop on health care equity and endow the Cummings Foundation Professorship of Global Health Equity at HMS.
Tuesday’s donation marks the biggest donation to HMS since 2018, when the school received a record-breaking $200 million from the Blavatnik Family Foundation.
Farmer — a renowned Harvard medical anthropologist, physician, and co-founder of global health nonprofit Partners in Health — died on Feb. 21 at the age of 62. Remembered for his tireless passion for teaching and deep humanity, Farmer battled health care inequality with a particular care for others. His efforts helped establish the University of Global Health Equity in Rwanda.
“During his all-too-brief time here with us, Paul was the vital physical link between Harvard and UGHE,” Joyce Cummings, co-founder of the Cummings Foundation, said in the release. “In Paul’s absence, it is critical that we act to ensure that this bond and his work endure.”
The Cummings Foundation donation marks one of the “most significant relationships” HMS has established in Africa, according to the release.
“This gift will allow us to continue Paul’s transformative work and honor his vision to reshape health care delivery for marginalized populations and to connect HMS with the University of Global Health Equity,” HMS Dean George Q. Daley said in the release.
“This gift is a powerful reminder that as a global community, we are only as strong as the most vulnerable among us, which Paul understood better than anyone,” he added.
In addition to the $50 million, the Cummings Foundation also gifted $2 million to UGHE for a new residential facility for visiting faculty.
Jim Yong Kim, newly-appointed chancellor of UGHE and co-founder of Partners in Health, expressed his gratitude for the “transformative” gift.
“UGHE is training a new generation of leaders who will bring together the best evidence and a strong commitment to equity to improve health systems in East Africa and beyond,” he said in the release. “Cummings Foundation’s visionary gift will greatly facilitate the exchange of knowledge between students and faculty in Boston and Butaro.”
The Cummings Foundation gift also honors University President Lawrence S. Bacow, who announced his plans to step down in June and will be succeeded by dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay.
“Harvard is so grateful for Cummings Foundation’s support to carry on Paul Farmer’s important work,” Bacow said in the release. “Through their thoughtful and generous philanthropy, Bill and Joyce have improved the lives of countless people throughout the world. This gift will build on their important work.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To kick off the second half of the season, the Harvard women’s ice hockey team (4-9-2, 3-6-2 ECAC) traveled across the river to MLB’s oldest active ballpark — Fenway Park — to face No. 4/3 Quinnipiac (19-3-0, 9-1-0) at Frozen Fenway 2023. When the teams last met in mid-October, the Bobcats cruised to a 5-2 win. The Crimson entered this matchup not having seen live action since its Dec. 3 win over St. Lawrence; meanwhile, the Bobcats were fresh off of a victory versus No. 2/2 Wisconsin on New Year’s Day. After a back-and-forth first period, Quinnipiac’s goal in the second period would prove to be the game-winner as the Bobcats defeated the Crimson 3-1.
While the NHL Winter Classic — played on the same ice four days earlier between the Boston Bruins and Pittsburgh Penguins — featured temperatures in the 50s, Frozen Fenway 2023 had no problems living up to its name. At puck drop on January 6th, temperatures were in the low 30s and sleeting. However, as the game entered the second intermission, the sleet turned to heavy snow, keeping the ice crew busy throughout the third period.
For the coaches, the weather affected strategy. “After the first period, we were trying to make some adjustments to play a lot more simple, make a lot less passes,” said Quinnipiac head coach Cassandra Turner.
But for those on the ice, the weather only added to the magic of the moment. “I wouldn’t want to play any other way,” junior forward Shannon Hollands said.
The inability to capitalize on momentum plagued Harvard throughout the contest. In the opening minutes of the first period, both teams generated good chances, but neither one converted those opportunities into a goal. The Crimson had a good opportunity to notch the first goal as it went on the power play following a tripping call against Bobcats defender Zoe Boyd three minutes into the first — but it was Quinnipiac who struck first. Forward Olivia Mobley gave the Bobcats an early 1-0 advantage with a shorthanded score following a Harvard turnover in the neutral zone.
In the second period, the Crimson was unable to capitalize on the play of sophomore goalie Alex Pellicci. Despite an immense 18-save effort from Pellicci in the second frame, Harvard found itself facing a two-goal deficit at the end of the second. Quinnipiac extended its lead with five minutes remaining in the second thanks to a goal from forward Nina Steigauf. Steigauf redirected a high shot into the back of the net with a strike that was inches away from being a high stick. “We gave her a whole lot of action, and [we] would have liked to play a little bit better in front of her,” said Harvard head coach Katey Stone.
The Crimson started the third period scorching hot with an early goal. The goal by Hollands cut the deficit to two and energized the Harvard squad. The nifty goal came off a long pass from sophomore forward Paige Lester. For Hollands, the finish was simple: “I just saw an open side far, shot, and there it was.” The goal comes in a season where Hollands has increased her offensive output, averaging 2.0 shots a game this season, up from 1.4 a year ago. “That’s definitely one of my goals going into this season,” said Hollands about getting more points on the board. [I’m] just trying to focus on getting any pucks to the net.”
However, the Crimson could not sustain any momentum, as the Bobcats answered back with a score by Madison Chantler 48 seconds later. The goal was Chantler’s ninth of the season and salted the game away.
On the offensive side of the puck, Harvard generated many quality chances but failed to convert them into tallies on the scoreboard. With two minutes left in the first period, Anne Bloomer almost tied the game with a shorthanded goal. After being set up with a perfect bounce pass off the boards, Bloomer had a breakaway opportunity, but the goal was not to be as Quinnipiac senior goalie Logan Angers made the save. Currently, Angers holds the 5th-best goals-against-average in NCAA Division I Women’s Ice Hockey at 1.364 and the 7th-best goalie-winning percentage at 0.786.
Through the first 20 minutes, the Harvard offense stood tall as it matched the shot total of Quinnipiac, which currently has the sixth-best scoring offense in the nation. The Crimson launched 37 shots on net in the contest, the third most it has all season.
Regardless of the outcome, neither team minimized what it meant to play at Fenway. “Definitely number one, that’s for sure,” said Hollands about where scoring at Fenway ranks in her career accomplishments. “This has got to be the top; I don’t even think it’s really close,” Angers said.
Harvard will look to rebound in its matchup against ECAC and Ivy League foe Princeton (8-6-1, 4-5-0) on Jan. 7. The midseason tilt will be critical as the two teams seek to move up from the middle of the ECAC table. The matchup will also be the first between the two teams since the Tigers upset the first-seeded Crimson in the first round of last year’s ECAC playoffs.
