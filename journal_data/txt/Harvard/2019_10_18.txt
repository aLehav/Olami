After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Let’s play a game: Scroll through new releases on Netflix and take a shot every time Noah Centineo appears in a teen rom-com as the “nice jock.”
As the man currently holding the coveted title of the Internet’s boyfriend, Centineo — with credits ranging from the tall, dark stranger that Camila Cabello dances with in her music video for “Havana” to the adorkable Peter Kavinsky from last summer’s hit film, “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before” — has likely appeared on your social media feed at least a few times. It’s not hard to see the appeal: Centineo’s face has launched a thousand heart emojis; his public persona is oddly reminiscent of a golden retriever; his #relatable tweets have sent legions of tweens swooning with their poetic eloquence (a personal favorite: “3 words. / Heated Toilet Seats”).
Recently, Centineo has been hard at work, racking up six film credits between 2017 and September 2019. In that short span of time, Centineo has been typecast so often as the teen heartthrob who falls for the oh-so-quirky outcast that he’s become his own genre of film. Let’s take a look at his list of films and determine exactly which ones are hot and which are Noah-t.
6. No, God! No, God Please No-ah!: “SPF-18”
Director Alex Israel really must’ve blown the entire budget on paying Keanu Reeves to come in for a two-second cameo, because besides Reeves’ appearance, there’s not a single draw to this film. “SPF-18” is visually amateurish and uninspired with its overuse of montages and reliance on a limited number of generic sets. Content-wise, it’s not much better, cooking up a stale plot stuffed to the brim with every teen movie trope. The premise of “SPF-18” revolves around Penny Cooper (Carson Meyer), your average girl-next-door living in L.A. who must choose between dating Johnny Sanders Jr. (Noah Centineo), the complicated, dreamboat surfer with a tragic backstory, and Ash Baker (Jackson White), the mysterious country singer who just rolled into town.
“SPF-18” is much like cotton candy: It lacks substance, is sickly sweet, and the young ‘uns love it. The tired old love-triangle-predicament is meant to make up the entirety of both the plot and Penny’s personality as she wanders around beaches and mansions with her gang of friends — hopping from one unrelated activity to another as if working through a vacation bucket list. Only about 30 percent of “SPF-18” is even about setting up a story, and the rest is intended to be emotional climax after climax with plenty of yelling, crying, and philosophical talks by the ocean. However, the point of a climax is that it’s the satisfying payoff of built-up tension — when there’s never any tension to begin with, the film simply turns into self-important, dramatic drivel.
5. Noah Can’tActineo: “Swiped”
Dagnabbit, all this new-fangled technology has corrupted the youth! What happened to talking face-to-face and no sex before marriage and sexist gender roles in relationships? The film “Swiped” exudes this energy, so if you’re not into that, spare yourself the headache and swipe left.
On a more serious note, “Swiped” truly is a badly-executed social satire on both online dating and the increased popularity of hook-up culture often associated with it, and it desperately rallies for a return to the golden days of ol’ fashioned, Nicholas Sparks-esque romance. Noah Centineo plays Lance Black, a womanizer who enlists the help of his geeky college roommate, James Singer (Kendall Ryan Sanders) to create a casual hook-up app called Jungle. As more and more people hop on the trend of digitally finding their next bed partner, James-the-resident-computer-genius realizes that it’s up to him to deactivate Jungle as well as all other dating apps on the market to make men rediscover their appreciation for meaningful romantic connections.
“Swiped” brands itself as a comedy film, but much of the intended humor falls flat because although the characters, events, and even the very premise of the plot all obviously rely on campy stereotypes, the script takes itself too seriously, creating an uncomfortable dissonance. At its heart, “Swiped” is really a patronizing parable of the sins of technology that distills relationships into sexist stereotypes in which all men are hormonal heathens with no regard for emotional intimacy and all women are portrayed as clingy creatures in desperate need of long-term romance.
4. Just Saw Noah, I Need a Corona: “Sierra Burgess is a Loser”
Repeat after me: The existence of personal insecurities does not automatically redeem a character and excuse their wrongs against other people. “Sierra Burgess is a Loser” really loses sight of that basic principle as it progresses, following Sierra Burgess (Shannon Purser), a shy band geek who catfishes Jamey, the handsome football hero from another high school.
“Sierra Burgess is a Loser” quickly spirals into disturbing territory when Sierra befriends Veronica (Kristine Froseth), a beautiful, popular cheerleader, and enlists her help to continue catfishing Jamey at an even more extreme level — for example, Veronica and Jamey would go on dates while Sierra follows close behind, sending cues to Veronica about what to say or do. The film’s framing of scenes like the one where Jamey thinks he’s about to kiss Veronica but Sierra swaps in while his eyes are closed is utterly absurd — from the close shot of their faces together to the grand, orchestral music that crescendos when their lips touch, it all romanticizes an act of sexual assault. What makes it worse is that even when Sierra is exposed as a catfish by the end of the film, Jamey inexplicably forgives her and they get their happily ever after.
The dubious morals promoted by “Sierra Burgess is a Loser” bars it from a higher ranking in this list. It really is a shame, because with just a few tweaks to the plot and especially the ending, this film could’ve brilliantly subverted teen tropes by revealing the shy protagonist as the true mean girl rather than the pretty popular chick that everyone suspects. Or, the director could have just put the “Psycho” backtrack over a couple scenes and marketed the film as horror.
3. Noah Causes Me Woe-ah: “Turkles”
You, a rationally-minded human being, might ask, “What is a turkle? Is it possibly the offspring of the mating between a turkey and a turtle, just as a liger is the young produced by a lion and a tiger?” No, dear reader, “turkle” is simply a dialectal pronunciation of “turtle,” according to Wiktionary — if only the scriptwriters for this film had your creativity! Before you turn away in disappointment, take heart from this bit of comedy gold: “Turkles” is about a ragtag group of kids attending an environmental protection program called Camp Loggerhead, where they learn fun facts about sea turtles’ natural habitats, food preferences, and mating habits by day and hunt down turtle-egg poachers by night. It’s worth noting that Noah Centineo was only about 15 when he starred as one of the meddling kids in this movie, and it sure says a lot that “Turkles” still ranks as one of the top films in his portfolio of work.
Do the camerawork and transitions between scenes in “Turkles” make it look like a YouTube skit? Yup. Does half the dialogue seem to have been copy-pasted from the encyclopedia entry under “sea turtle”? Definitely. Pitted against almost any other selection of films, “Turkles” would not garner much praise, but since we’re operating within the context of Noah Centineo films, a kiddie adventure movie with a clear eco-activist agenda is a refreshing break from sappy rom-com after rom-com.
2. Noah Think I’ll Pass: “The Perfect Date”
In “The Perfect Date,” Noah Centineo plays Brooks Rattigan, a high schooler who dreams of attending Yale. In an effort to earn money for college tuition, Brooks enlists the help of his geeky friend, Murph (Odiseas Georgiadis) to create an app where people can hire Brooks as a fake-date for any given event. Brooks ends up posing as a prom date for Celia Lieberman (Laura Marano), who’s just so unique and unlike other girls that no guy from her school could handle asking her out. Plot twist: Brooks ends up actually falling for Celia and gives up on the business of being an escort. No one saw that coming.
Look at the plot summary of “Swiped.” Now look back at the plot summary of “The Perfect Date.” If you pick up a magnifying glass, you may be able to discern some minute differences between these two movies, which were released on Netflix less than one year apart. So why does “The Perfect Date” rank above “Swiped” if they’re essentially the same film? For one thing, the production budget was marginally higher. For another, Brooks seemed to actually have aspirations for success outside of getting with his love interest, but even that’s debatable by the end of the film since he abandons his dreams of Yale and instead writes a love letter styled after a college application, inquiring to be accepted to “the University of Celia Lieberman.” Yeah, Brooks, go get that education! Oh, wait…
1. Noah-t That Bad: “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before”
To absolutely no one’s surprise, the single movie on Centineo’s résumé that you wouldn’t have to pay someone to watch is the one where another actor (ahem, Lana Condor) carries the movie. “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before” follows Lara Jean Covey (Condor), a high school wallflower who winds up fake-dating Peter Kavinsky (Centineo) in order to avoid an awkward confrontation with Josh Sanderson (Israel Broussard), her childhood friend, her older sister’s recently-ex-boyfriend, and a recipient of one of Lara Jean’s secret love letters that got leaked. She promises that she won’t actually fall in love with Peter, but you know better than to trust a line like that in a rom-com.
Despite the overused fake-dating premise, “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before” sets itself apart from the rest of the films on this list because rather than lazily relying on tropes to carry the story, it cleverly plays with dramatic irony to make the audience curious to see just how the classic romance tropes play out even if they know the inevitable ending. Moreover, the side characters actually have an effect on the plot, so their interactions with Lara Jean and Peter reveal new facets of the protagonists’ identities other than their infatuation with each other. All in all, “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before” is a sweet, lighthearted film that’s worth a few hours of your weekend. If you’re hoping to keep your positive opinion of Noah Centineo as an actor, you’re advised to watch just this one film and leave it at that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From the vibrant and colorful fruit stands in the streets of Palestinian cities to the friendly store owners at every corner, I am always ecstatic to be in Palestine. Being home means being surrounded by loved ones and being in a place that continues to give me above and beyond what I could ever repay it. I consider it a blessing and an honor to call Palestine home. I strongly urge anyone who can to visit the region. But you should you go about doing that?
The opportunities and options to visit Palestine and Israel are numerous, many of which are organized trips that are fully funded by different parties. Currently, Harvard Hillel’s registration for one of these fully-subsidized trips, Birthright, is in full swing and the campus is flooded with students sharing registration information.
I am here to tell you one thing: Visit the region, just not on Birthright.
Birthright is a ten day trip to Israel for Jewish young adults ages 18 to 32. Their mission statement is “to ensure the vibrant future of the Jewish people by strengthening Jewish identity, Jewish communities, and connection with Israel.” But the reasons I am encouraging you to not partake in this trip outweigh the one justification, represented in the mission statement, for going on a Birthright trip.
First, Birthright trips do not expose their groups to the harsh reality that Palestinians living just minutes away from some of the trip’s destination experience. The lack of resources, blatant discrimination, and danger that Palestinians experience is difficult to grasp even with a well-rounded approach, but absolutely impossible to comprehend through a trip like Birthright, which chooses to completely disregard and intentionally overlook this reality.
This trip never exposes participants to Palestinian cities, villages, and refugee camps. Attempts to enter Palestinian controlled areas are carefully planned and executed in a way that avoids confronting the reality people are living. The region, which is exposed to Israeli oppression and occupation is carefully, and dare I say strategically, left out of the trip agenda, contributing to a one-sided and biased perception of the status quo. This reality was experienced firsthand by a Birthright participant, Risa Negal, who decided to venture off her meticulously planned trip and wrote about her experience afterwards.
A target audience for Birthright are individuals who have never visited or lived in Israel before. Participants receive full funding for the trip, including excursions on the itinerary. Whereas on the other hand, Palestinian refugees living all around the world, yearning to visit, are not allowed to step foot in their birthplace or visit family living in the region. So how is this dynamic fair?
On another note, Birthright’s largest donor and prime cheerleader is the right-wing casino magnate and mega-donor Sheldon Adelson, who happens to be one of President Donald Trump’s closest advisers and one of his largest donors.
When receiving something of value for free, one should be extra cognizant, be it a new smartphone or a free trip to Israel. Who is ultimately paying for your freebie matters, and has the potential to come back and haunt you and your career, not to mention blinding you from reality. Case in point is the Jeffrey E. Epstein fiasco that recently reached both Harvard and MIT, both of which Epstein donated to.
The trip and its agenda is as problematic as the planning and people behind it. People and powers who fund Birthright are detached from the reality of the situation, and are moving the pawns of that region’s chess game from far away without truly experiencing the reality on the ground.
The ramifications of Birthright can be overlooked by those who support the trip, but they are truly detrimental to citizens of the region. Consequences extend far beyond the ten days the participants spend in Israel, especially when the eligible audience is taken into account. This program definitely feeds a vision of creating a large Jewish, predominantly American Jewish, youth diaspora that has a very strong loyalty to the State of Israel, even though they are usually raised in a different country with a totally different set of values. In the past, some individuals returned to Israel after a Birthright trip to serve in the Israeli Defense Forces, often directly affecting the same Palestinian population they were never exposed to during the trip.
I am in no position, and cannot force anyone, to not go on a Birthright trip; it is ultimately a personal choice. I am merely trying to offer an opinion from the other side of the checkpoint and the separation wall that Birthright trip participants do not get the opportunity to witness or hear. I am asking you to pay my side of the wall, the wall that I think should not exist, a visit, and then make your judgement about the region and everyone living in it.
With that said, I still completely stand by my recommendation that every single willing and able person should visit Palestine and Israel, and there are several other opportunities for that. Some of the Jewish focused trips that visit both Israel and Palestine and have a diverse line-up of speakers from different backgrounds and views include Encounter, Extend, If NotNow, Green Olive Tours, J Street and others. Choose a trip that exposes you to a range of voices and reach your own conclusions, do not let anyone else do that for you. That is something you owe yourself, and your community, as an active citizen in this world.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In America the people who are deemed “other” are being controlled by the white men in power. Native Americans are fighting to keep their land out of the hands of those who are stealing it away for their own personal gain. The government has little sense of legitimate order to it.
Am I referring to America in 1492 or 2019? Honestly, it is hard for even me to say.
Of course, we’ve come so far in the past few centuries. We have electricity! We have the Internet! We have smartphones smaller than our hands that have more power and access to knowledge than anything in human history! We have nuclear weapons! We’ve come so much further than anything people could have imagined when they first arrived in America.
However, not all people have basic rights, even in America — the self-purported bastion of the Western world. One would think that in the over 500 years since Columbus “sailed the ocean blue,” we would have made more progress in terms of equality for all people. One would hope that women and men would be treated equally. One would hope that Native Americans would no longer be demanding basic rights from the government. One would hope a lot of things that are simply not true.
In some ways, it is alarming how many parallels do still exist between 21st century America and 15th century America. In 1492, European colonizers came to this country and claimed it for their own. They decided to abuse Native American people and take their land away without a legitimate claim. Then they silenced them so that they would have no ability to actually protest any of these changes.
And today? Only two years ago, U.S. President Donald Trump authorized the Keystone XL Pipeline regardless of the effects it would have on Native American water supplies or the fact that it would be built near “culturally sensitive sites in North Dakota.” Native Americans still have poverty rates of 26 percent and a median income that is only 69 percent of the national average.
Naturally, the United States government recognizes the second Monday in October as Columbus Day. It recognizes it as such in order to ensure that we never forget the “amazing” accomplishments of Christopher Columbus. The man who enslaved over one thousand people on Hispaniola — not even taking into account the hundreds of thousands who were enslaved in the next few decades by his followers. The man who slaughtered people in order to stem rebellions by those who simply wanted their own land and autonomy restored. The man who introduced so many new diseases to these populations that his arrival was essentially equivalent to waging biological warfare. The man who has been given credit for discovering the New World — a land where an estimated 60 million people were already settled.
But of course we should want to celebrate Columbus Day instead of Indigenous Peoples’ Day. If there are going to be only ten official federal holidays, it makes sense that one would be for Christopher Columbus. He basically is just as important and revered as Martin Luther King, Jr. and George Washington — the only other two people who get a federal holiday for themselves. Veterans may get a day as a collective group, but of course the service they’ve made to this country as a whole is equivalent to Christopher Columbus’.
Why don’t we hand out days to some other people? Why not give Andrew Jackson a celebration because, even if his actions did lead to the Trail of Tears, he also championed the rights of the common man? Or Richard Nixon, who founded the Environmental Protection Agency, even if he was also the only president to ever resign?
Maybe as we reflect on this most recent Columbus Day, we should think about the fact that according to true American values, no one is ever owed anything. Instead, one must earn their spot — or at least that’s what we proclaim to others when asserting our superiority. And while this principle may have proved not to be true in recent situations, it is still a core principle of this country.
So why don’t we hold Columbus Day to these same standards?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Director of Athletics Robert L. Scalise prepares to step down, a new group of athletic leaders is making itself known across Harvard’s playing fields and campus. A group of seniors founded Women of Harvard Athletics — a club aimed at combating what its founders characterize as “underrepresentation” of women in Harvard athletic programs. Citing inequalities in game attendance, cultural attitudes, and institutional and financial support, the new organization hopes to support women athletes through the challenges of underrepresentation with a variety of measures, including workshops, panels, and wellness classes.
We applaud Women of Harvard Athletics’ creation, and are heartened by the rapid growth of the organization, which already boasts over 100 members. Given the horrifying recent national and Harvard related scandals which have disproportionately affected women’s athletics programs, we believe student advocacy on these issues is incredibly important both in its own right and toward spurring the athletics administration to devote more attention to them. As the University and its affiliates more broadly works to overcome the legacy of gender inequality in athletics, the athletic administration should move decisively to address their concerns.
A timely administration response is also crucial, as it will lighten the load on students leading the way. As athletes and students with extensive time commitments in both, these women already face enough work without also having to devote their time to achieving fair representation in athletics, which should go without question to begin with.
Therefore, while we applaud students for leading WHA and working to effect change through it, we worry about the extent to which the extra work they put into these advocacy efforts detracts from their capacity for self-care and the other responsibilities of their lives. The administration should take into account this labor and step up to share the load of these efforts in enacting changes.
Failure to do so on the part of the administration suggests a lack of respect for the difficulty of shouldering the added responsibility of advocating for fairness that should be the bedrock of any competent administration. We hope that going forward the athletic administration, as well as students, will increase efforts to publicize, support, and create events surrounding women’s events as they do for many men’s events.
It is important to note that while this organization seeks to address the difficulties associated with the particular experience of one group at Harvard, namely female athletes, some of those difficulties are not unique to them. WHA no doubt fills a serious gap, but we also hope the group considers how some of their concerns may overlap with those of other groups on campus. The broader problems of body image and increased vulnerability to sexual and gender-based violence affect female-identifying people across Harvard. In recognition of that, we hope WHA considers fostering inter-group dialogue and collaboration across different campus groups to advance common goals for a more equitable community.
As Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay noted in her email announcing his retirement, Scalise’s administration worked to expand opportunities for female athletes during his tenure, most recently through the addition of the women’s rugby team. But this work is only the beginning, and we are glad to see WHA pushing the boundaries of what it means to be a female athlete on our campus and how our community can support these women in their competition and care of self.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Oct. 19, 2019 at 3:30 p.m. 
Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise will retire in June 2020, after more than 50 years at Harvard serving in a variety of roles including coach and Business School associate dean.
In an email to the Athletics department Thursday, Scalise thanked the people he has worked with over his tenure and wrote that he is “proud” to have served as director for 18 years.
“Harvard is many things to many different people, but in my mind, the purpose of Harvard has always been to create knowledge and to educate leaders to serve the world,” he wrote. “I am very proud to have supported this work by leading an Athletics department whose mission is to Educate through Athletics and to Build Community and Pride in Harvard.”
He also noted that he will continue to serve as an adviser to Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay on athletics throughout the 2020-2021 academic year.
Scalise was a former Ivy league varsity athlete himself, receiving All-American honors for playing lacrosse at Brown University. He first came to Harvard in 1974 as coach of the men’s lacrosse team. In 1977, he started the women’s varsity soccer program and coached both men’s lacrosse and women’s soccer until 1986 and 1987, respectively.
After earning a masters degree from the Harvard Business School in 1989, Scalise later became the associate dean for administration and senior executive office at HBS, where he oversaw the school’s $200 million budget from 1996 until his appointment as Athletics Director in 2001. He will end his tenure June 30.
Former University president Lawrence H. Summers and former Dean of the Faculty Jeremy R. Knowles appointed Scalise with the goal of broadening the range of students who participate in the College’s athletic program in mind.
Scalise’s resume as Athletics Director includes 22 national titles, 144 Ivy League titles, and 14 victories over longtime rival Yale in the 17 editions of “The Game” during his tenure. He received the National Football Foundation’s Toner Award for excellence in athletic administration and dedication to college athletics in 2018.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay wrote in an email to FAS affiliates that Scalise’s impact has been wide-ranging over his tenure.
“Whether you are a varsity athlete, a participant in an intramural club sport, or someone like me who just takes a break from work to let off steam on the treadmill, Bob’s thoughtful leadership has touched your life and helped to shape your Harvard experience,” she wrote.
She stressed that Scalise’s years as director were about more than just winning championships,
“He has been a leading voice in national discussions of the student athlete experience,” she wrote. “On campus, he has led Department-wide discussions of culture, enhanced training opportunities for students and staff, and successfully advocated for expanded mental health support for athletes.”
Head Varsity Squash Coach Mike Way said Scalise’s voice has been “powerful and invaluable” within the Athletics department. When Scalise called an athletics staff-wide meeting to share his retirement announcement personally, he received a “standing ovation,” according to Way.
Brant Berktresser, the associate director of athletics for student-athlete health and performance, wrote in an email that Scalise has been a particularly strong supporter for the sports medicine department.
“[Scalise] has supported our research partnerships with medical school colleagues which is enhancing the clinical care of our student-athletes and others in areas of sports cardiology and concussion,” Berktresser wrote.
Kathy Delaney-Smith, head coach for the Harvard’s women’s basketball team, said that she hopes the new Athletics Director has the same “hands-on” approach as Scalise. “I clearly remember Bob coming in [in 2001] and saying, ‘What changes do we need?’ ‘What can you say to me that will help me, help you?’”
She added that Scalise’s experience with Ivy League athletics and Harvard specifically will be missed.
“As an [Athletics Director], he had a phenomenal amount of Ivy League knowledge and in particular, Harvard knowledge and Harvard experience,” she said. “Harvard is a very complicated place, and he knew this place inside and out – both sides of the river."
Scalise’s retirement comes at a tenuous time for the department. Former Harvard fencing coach Peter Brand was dismissed in July for violating Harvard’s conflict of interest policy. Gay also recently announced that outside consulting firm Mercer would conduct a review of the Harvard’s Athletics program in the coming year.
Scalise’s retirement also coincides with the retirement of former Senior Associate Athletic Director Patricia Henry, who stepped down in June, concluding her 40-year tenure.
Scalise wrote that he hopes to spend more time with his wife and children following his retirement.
Harvard will conduct a national search to identify Scalise’s successor, and he will serve until a new director is appointed, according to Gay.
Student Athlete Advisory Council co-president Madison Earle ’20 said she hopes Scalise’s successor will advocate for student-athletes both academically and athletically.
“I want to see someone who is involved in all aspects of campus: not only with the student athletes but also across the river, just making sure that we’re being heard not only sporting-wise but also academically,” Earle said.
“I think Bob has excelled in that area,” she added.
Correction: Oct. 17, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that former Senior Associate Athletic Director Patricia Henry will be retiring June 2020. In fact, she retired this past June.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 50 Harvard affiliates gathered in the Science Center Thursday evening at a town hall to discuss the results of a campus-wide sexual misconduct climate survey that found incidences of sexual misconduct have remained largely unchanged over the past four years.
Several University administrators including University President Lawrence S. Bacow spoke at the event and fielded questions from student attendees. Bacow reiterated comments he made in an email accompanying the survey results Tuesday. At the time, he wrote they were “profoundly disturbing.”
“I'm profoundly saddened and disturbed that we find ourselves after five years in essentially the same position that we were before,” Bacow said. “Each individual who calls this university home should be made to feel as if they are welcome, they are free from harassment, and that this is a place where they can be their best selves.”
After Bacow concluded his remarks, he ceded the podium to Business School professor Kathleen L. McGinn, who co-chaired the steering committee that planned and analyzed the survey alongside Deputy Provost Margaret “Peggy” E. Newell. McGinn spent roughly an hour going through the survey results, at one point calling them “mind-numbing.”
The Association of American Universities administered the survey — the largest of its kind — in April. Nationwide, 180,000 students at 33 universities answered questions about harassment, stalking, and their experiences with sexual misconduct on campus. Harvard’s response rate was roughly 36 percent of the University, or 8,300 students.
The 2019 iteration of the survey came four years after its 2015 debut, when Harvard found that 31 percent of its senior undergraduate women had experienced nonconsensual sexual contact during their time at Harvard. Since then, the University Title IX Office has undergone significant changes. The Office split in two in 2017, and it implemented mandatory trainings for students, faculty, and staff in subsequent years.
The 2019 survey, however, found that Harvard’s rate of students experiencing nonconsensual sexual contact remained stagnant. While students reported feeling more knowledgeable about Title IX policies and definitions, 32 percent of undergraduate women said they had experienced unwelcome sexual contact while at Harvard. Less than half of students said they are “extremely” or “very” confident that campus officials would conduct a fair investigation based on a complaint of sexual misconduct.
McGinn highlighted other trends in the data toward the end of her presentation, noting that the majority of people who had reportedly committed sexual misconduct were themselves students. She also pointed to data showing that the majority of both survey-takers who reported misconduct and the alleged perpetrators drank alcohol before the incident in question, and that on-campus housing was the most common location for such incidents when they involved undergraduates.
During a question and answer session at the end of the evening, Newell spoke to the strategies and goals the University has moving forward — including the importance of including men in conversations about sexual assault.
“All of our committees are open. What we usually can’t do is force them to come. But we are absolutely happy to have men involved in that conversation, and we do our best to reach people of all genders,” Newell said.
Several students also asked McGinn and Newell how they would use the survey results to directly decrease sexual assault rates. McGinn responded by turning their questions back — she asked audience members for advice, input, or stories they think would help the steering committee.
“You can't create cultural change by having committees,” she said. “You have to start with community-wide conversation. That's what we're starting tonight. And I can see all of you struggling in the same way that we struggle, with what can we do to move forward?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
OTTO Pizza reopened in Harvard Square this past Friday after a hood-vent fire over the summer forced the restaurant to close temporarily.
The fire, which caused no injuries, had forced OTTO to shutter its Square location for four months to repair the resulting damage. In celebration of its reopening, OTTO will be randomly offering 1,000 “free slice” cards to patrons in Harvard Square.
Since the reopening, OTTO Pizza has not seen any major changes in foot traffic, according to shift manager Skyla Zo.
“We have had a lot of new customers come in and mostly our ritualistic customers, which has been wonderful for us and for them,” Zo said. “Everyone seems to be very excited that we have opened back up.”
The Harvard Square Business Association worked to highlight OTTO’s reopening when it planned its Oktoberfest event this past weekend, according to HSBA Executive Director Denise A. Jillson.
“I made it really, you know, a real conscious decision during setting up the map for Oktoberfest, not to put anybody in front of OTTO Pizza,” Jillson said.
Jillson added that when businesses have issues with their property or their machinery and are forced to close, the HBSA “takes its cue from the business” when evaluating how best to assist the store.
Along with the updated space, OTTO patrons can also look forward to new Italian specialties on the menu.
“We’ve added some new pies, we’ve added some new salads, and now we even offer tiramisu,” Zo said.
Though OTTO is resuming its operations, the Square continues to see considerable commercial turnover. In the past four months, other Square hallmarks including Out of Town News, Flat Patties, and Black Ink have all announced that they will close by the end of the year.
OTTO Pizza supervisor Steve Smith said he is excited to return to work after the temporary closure.
“I like being back at work honestly. I know it sounds weird to say that,” Smith said. “But I enjoy the people that I work with. It’s nice being back here.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard and its graduate student union tentatively agreed on two new contract provisions Thursday in the first bargaining session since union members began voting on whether to authorize a strike over a lack of progress in negotiations.
The two sides came to a consensus on a provision regarding international student rights, as well as one on workspaces and materials. Meanwhile, the union will keep polls open for its strike authorization vote at least into next week, according to bargaining committee member Rachel J. Sandalow-Ash ’15.
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers bargaining committee member Ege Yumusak ’16 wrote in an email that the new international students agreement will “set standards” for graduate student union contracts at other universities.
“The tentative agreement we reached today will do much to advance immigrant and international student workers’ rights on campus,” Yumusak wrote. “We are committed to continuing to fight for immigrant justice.”
International student workers will be allowed five days off to work through visa issues under the tentative agreement, according to Yumusak. It also guarantees that immigration attorneys will visit campus each semester, and that student workers denied entry to the United States due to visa issues will have job security.
University spokesperson Jonathan Swain wrote that Harvard is pleased with the developments in negotiations.
"We welcome the progress today with the two additional tentative agreements,” Swain wrote in an emailed statement. “The University continues to approach these negotiations and the discussion on the issues at the bargaining table in good faith.”
Under the tentative workspace and materials agreement, the University will provide student workers with necessary supplies and desk space “at no cost,” Sandalow-Ash wrote.
The agreement on desk space marks a “substantial improvement” because some student workers currently lack permanent desks, Sandalow-Ash added.
Swain added that the international students agreement came out of the work of a subcommittee, which met outside of full bargaining sessions and included representatives from the Harvard International Office, the University’s negotiating team, and HGSU-UAW.
Student workers across the University began voting Tuesday on whether to authorize a strike. Tuesday marked the one year anniversary of the beginning of negotiations. HGSU announced the vote Oct. 8, citing stalls on certain contractual issues — including compensation, healthcare, and harassment and discrimination protections.
If two-thirds of voting members approve the authorization, the HGSU bargaining committee would be authorized to call a strike when it sees fit.
Polling stations have been open in at least 21 locations across the University’s Cambridge and Longwood campuses since Tuesday.
Sandalow-Ash wrote that despite Thursday’s agreements, “major outstanding issues” remain unaddressed by the University. She said that the strike authorization vote will continue into next week. It was previously unclear whether voting would conclude on Friday — the final day listed on the union’s initial voting schedule.
“This past week, the energy of the strike vote has been amazing,” Sandalow-Ash wrote. “It is clear that student workers across campus are deeply frustrated by the administration’s refusal to agree to fair pay, comprehensive and affordable healthcare, or protections against discrimination and harassment.”
“Student workers are ready to take action,” she added.
Thursday’s developments mark the ninth and tenth provisions agreed upon since negotiations began, and the first since Sept. 9, when the two sides came together on a provision regarding student travel reimbursements.
Also on Thursday, the National Labor Relations Board extended the comment period for its proposed rule changes on who can be classified as a student employee, according to a press release. The proposed changes would essentially reverse a 2016 decision that opened the door for students at private universities and colleges — including Harvard — to unionize.
The original 60-day comment period was set to end on Nov. 22, but the submission window will now remain open through Dec. 16, the release said. Replies to the initial comments can be submitted until Dec. 30.
HGSU has been encouraging its members to submit comments to the proposed rule change.
The next bargaining session will be held on Oct. 30, according to bargaining committee member Lee Kennedy-Shaffer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Kennedy School has seen little or no change across various demographics in its student, faculty, and staff population, according to the school’s annual diversity report released Thursday.
The school saw only a marginal uptick in the racial diversity of its student body compared with last year. Fifty-eight percent of students this year identify as white, while 60 percent did last year. The school continues to have no students of Native American, Alaskan Native, Native Pacific Islander, or Native Hawaiian background. The tenured faculty composition remains identical to last year — professors at the Kennedy School are 79 percent white and 78 percent male.
Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf ’85, who emailed the report to school affiliates, said in an interview Thursday that there was a need for improvement in representation.
“Improving the Kennedy School. . .is a responsibility that I have as dean, a responsibility that all the members of our leadership team share in, and a responsibility that everyone at the school shares in some ways,” he said.
When the Kennedy School released its first diversity report in 2018 — per the advice of its Task Force on Diversity and Inclusion — many affiliates voiced concerns about the lack of diversity it revealed within the school and called for administrators to improve the representation of minority students and female faculty.
In response to the continued gender imbalance within the school’s faculty, Elmendorf said the school matches the industries from which it draws scholars.
“That reflects in part the gender composition of the fields from which we do most of our hiring,” he said. “The most common disciplinary backgrounds [among] the faculty at the Kennedy School are Economics and Political Science.”
“But, we think we can do better over time,” he added.
He said the school has introduced new hiring processes to account for gender bias among its feeder fields.
Bryan Cortes, a member of the school’s Journal of Hispanic Policy and the Latinx Caucus, wrote in an email that his organization plans to push administrators to improve the “abysmal” representation of minorities among its students and faculty.
“The School still has a long way to create a student body and faculty that is representative of the society we live in,” he wrote.
Professor Khalil G. Muhammad, who teaches on history, race, and public policy, said there is a need for a larger transformaton of the culture of diversity at the Kennedy School.
“[The report] is far from a sufficient reflection of the need for a massive shift in the culture and climate of the Kennedy School,” Muhammad said.
Muhammad is currently the only tenured black faculty member at the Kennedy School after professor William J. Wilson ’96 retired earlier this year. He said the difficulties the school appears to face with minority recruitment and retention within its student body are mirrored at the faculty level.
Muhammad said the school must look beyond numbers when seeking to improve diversity and consider all aspects of its “larger systemic issues.”
“Even if the numbers were to improve marginally, that would not necessarily reflect the significance of the culture, climate, and pedagogical changes that need to occur at the school,” Muhammad said.
Latinx Caucus co-chairs Karla B. Magana Figueroa and Thomas A. Franco wrote in an email that a lack of financial aid at the school also exacerbates its issues with racial diversity.
“While we are working to increase the number of admitted underrepresented minorities, we are also analyzing how lack of financial aid is contributing to the issue,” they wrote.
Elmendorf said the school has need-blind admissions, but struggles to meet students' financial needs.
“We do not meet the need of our admitted students in the way the College does,” he said. “And that is a challenge. It was a priority of my predecessor and is a priority of mine to increase financial aid at the Kennedy School, so more people can come here who don't have the means.”
According to Elmendorf, the Kennedy School has undertaken several new initiatives to improve minority recruitment at the school and to incorporate diversity into faculty hiring practices.
In an effort to attract more minority applicants, the school recently appointed an administrative fellow and a new assistant dean of enrollment services who are working to develop new recruitment strategies. The Kennedy School has also partnered with the Congressional Black Caucus and Congressional Latinx Caucus in the United States House of Representatives to encourage students of color to apply.
“We are actively working to cast a wider net,” Elmendorf said.

For the Harvard crew teams and fans around the world, the most wonderful time of year is approaching: the highly-anticipated Head of the Charles Regatta. It takes place every year in Cambridge in mid-October, and all four Crimson teams, women’s and men’s lightweight and heavyweight, will be racing.
Not only is the Head of the Charles the largest two-day regatta in the world, but it is also the first regatta of the Harvard crew season, requiring ample physical and mental preparation from the Crimson.
The teams hit the ground running with intense training both on and off the river.
“We’ve really been concentrating on a higher-level focus in our training. We’ve also been running the stadium twice a week,” said senior men’s lightweight rower Aidan Crawford.
Similarly, lightweight women’s crew is working to build a strong base, and they did an erg test on the first day of practice to dive right into intense training.
“People really did well with summer training and staying fit on their own… That set us up well to start hard training early on,” said women’s lightweight captain Molly Lesser.
In addition to erging and rowing on the river, the teams have been running and lifting frequently.
In terms of mental preparation, Harvard is using its experience with the Head of the Charles and other big regattas to its advantage.
“People are generally pretty mentally prepared for the effort… we have a lot of experience, even in the freshman class, of racing at really high-caliber events,” said first-year John Mark Ozaeta, a men’s heavyweight participant who is already attending the Head of the Charles for the third time.
Another important part of the Crimson’s mental preparation has been its cultivation of team chemistry, which aims to make races smoother and more successful. While the teams are confident in their experience, there’s understandably still some nervousness among the rowers.
“There’s definitely more pressure because the Head of the Charles’s the highlight of the fall racing season,” Crawford said.
Crawford offsets this pressure by preparing for the regatta in a more light-hearted manner, including getting frozen yogurt with his boatmates and sending them famous speeches from movies to motivate them.
With the race taking place in its backyard, Harvard is looking forward to the advantage of racing at home on the Charles, where the Crimson rowers are comfortable and well-versed in the river’s terrain. All four teams have been practicing long pieces on the course. Being at home also means that Harvard will garner support from fellow students.
“It’s nice to have a bunch of people show out when we race down the river on our home course,” said Ozaeta.
This is not the Crimson’s only race on the Charles of the season, but it will presumably be the one with the largest crowd of student spectators, which adds an extra level of excitement for the rowers.
For the teams, the Head of the Charles regatta means more than racing; it means that they get to see their families and friends from high school rowing, making this weekend a busy one for them. Early in the season, the coaches informed their rowers about the itinerary for the weekend so that they would be able to plan time both to see their loved ones and to get off their feet for a few hours to rest. The night before the regatta, the four Harvard crew teams will have a banquet, and they will have team meals scattered throughout the regatta for some bonding and downtime.
“It’s so fun. But you have to realistically be like, ‘I’m also racing, the goal of this weekend is to race and to do well,’” said Lesser when describing the importance of balancing social time and recovery time during the regatta.
The Crimson has a good track record at the Head of the Charles; last year, women’s heavyweight finished in 12th place overall, men’s heavyweight finished in fifth, and men’s lightweight placed sixth. The women’s lightweight fours won, while the eights came in fifth and ninth. This year, Harvard is once again expected to be competitive.
“I’m racing in the second eight, and we’re starting just in front of Yale, so that’s a big motivator. We’ll see them our entire way down the course,” said Ozaeta.
Bolstered by its preparation and motivation, the Crimson rowing will look to capture the same success they have had in past years.

At the Head of the Charles, twenty different trophies are up for grabs. This weekend, everyone from high school racers to veteran scullers will vie for one of the regatta’s prestigious pieces of hardware. Each one showcases a different person, city, or sponsor that helped shape the Head of the Charles into the premier two-day rowing spectacle that it is today.
The first Head of the Charles took place on October 16, 1965. In the race’s pilot rendition, nearly 300 rowers competed in singles, fours, and eights. The event steadily grew throughout the years, garnering great success and notoriety. In 1997, the regatta extended to span two days. Currently, in its 55th year, over 11,000 athletes are set to compete in 66 different races.
The Head of the Charles is co-hosted by the cities of Boston and Cambridge each year, so each co-host city is honored with a trophy in its name. The City of Boston Trophy is bestowed upon the women’s lightweight eights champions while the City of Cambridge Trophy goes to the women’s lightweight fours champion.
The club, school, college, or university with overall “rowing supremacy” earns the coveted Regatta Point Trophy. “Rowing supremacy” is calculated based on each fours and eights entry. For each entry P, the number of points gained towards the Regatta Point Trophy equals 100 divided by 1+100(E/F-1), where E is the Entry’s time and F is the fastest time in the event in which the entry competed. Each institution’s P scores are totaled, and the group with the highest score wins the elusive prize.
This trophy also honors of D’Arcy G. MacMahon, one of the regatta’s three cofounders. MacMahon attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he captained the lightweight varsity crew team. MacMahon eventually became a member of the Cambridge Boat Club, an organization over which he later presided from 1974-1976.
George Ernest Arlett, a former Harvard sculling instructor, also has a trophy presented in his memory: The G Ernest Arlett Trophy, which goes to the Men’s Lightweight Singles champion.
Arlett, a member of the Northeastern University Athletics Hall of Fame and former Olympic sculling coach at the 1976 games, played a key role in advising the founders of the Head of the Charles. Arlett grew up in England and, after moving to Boston, introduced MacMahon and his fellow co-founders, Howard McIntyre and Jack Vincent, to the concept of a head race. These time trial competitions, usually three miles in length, were common in England at the time despite being a novel concept in the United States. Thanks to Arlett’s advice, the designers of the Head of the Charles modelled it as a head race, so Arlett is often considered “the father of the Head of the Charles.”
Two more important trophies go to the men’s and women’s championship eights victors. The team winning the men’s championship eights receives the Boston Globe Challenge Trophy, and the publisher and editorial staff of the Boston Globe present the trophy themselves. The Boston Globe inaugurally sponsors and supports the Head of the Charles Regatta. Likewise, the team conquering the women’s championship eights receives the Governor’s Trophy. By presenting this trophy, the Office of the Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts honors the international acclaim the Head of the Charles Regatta brings to Massachusetts each fall.
The collegiate women’s championship eights team boasting the most competitive time wins the Gail Pierson Trophy. On Oct. 26, 1969, Pierson Cromwell became the first woman to race at the Head of the Charles Regatta. Gail Pierson Cromwell swam and sailed at the University of Michigan before arriving at Harvard as an Assistant Professor in 1968. After the university refused to admit her into their pool, Pierson Cromwell began rowing with the Cambridge Boat Club. She took an immediate liking to the sport, becoming a pioneer for women rowers nationwide. After her success at the Head of the Charles, Pierson Cromwell continued rowing and eventually competed for the women’s world championships team in 1975. The Head of the Charles continues to pay homage to her legacy each year with a trophy in her honor.
The winner of the men’s championship doubles earns a trophy in memory of Pierson Cromwell’s late husband, Seymour “Sy” Cromwell. Cromwell became a world-renowned sculling champion, winning bronze in the 1961 European Rowing Championships, gold in the 1963 Pan American Games, and silver in Double Sculls in the 1964 Olympic Games. Today, his memory lives on at the Head of the Charles through the Sy Cromwell Trophy.
The 55th Head of the Charles kicks off Saturday, Oct. 19th, at 7:45am. Tune in to this weekend of nonstop racing to see who will claim this year’s trophies.

There was not a sudden moment when Harvard heavyweight rower Clark Dean realized he could be something special — not a single race to point to, nor a random late-night realization. His potential was always growing, and this became incrementally clearer every time his efforts were tested.
By now, his prowess on the water is evident. The collegiate rower has postponed his sophomore year to train in Oakland, Calif., as part of the selection process for the United States 2020 Olympic team. However, the journey that led to him to Harvard and beyond began much earlier.
Dean grew up in Sarasota, Florida and attended The Pine View School which offered no school sports. Following the lead of some of his friends, Dean gave rowing a try in sixth grade with the Sarasota Crew team that was closeby. It wasn’t until high school that he decided to focus on rowing and give up his other interests in swimming and lacrosse.

“It got to that point where I couldn’t progress in a way that was ideal in any of the sports I was playing, if I didn’t pick one,” Dean said. “I think the things that hooked me about rowing, then, are still things I appreciate now. It’s a team sport so you get all the benefits that come with that while also getting to see how much you improve individually.”
In high school, Dean’s training took nearly 30 hours a week. His school schedule was changed to accomodate a two-hour training session in the morning and a three-hour session each afternoon. His school day typically began later than that of his peers, when he was often coming in at 9 or 10 am. By senior year, he was taking three of his classes online to compensate for his rigorous rowing schedule.
It wasn’t long before Dean reached a competitive level and was recruited to top-tier schools. In both 2017 and 2018, Dean was the junior world champion in the men’s single. This led to his selection as the US Rowing Junior National Athlete of the Year for two consecutive years. While high school athletes who have dominated on the world stage sometimes consider giving up their amateur status — which is necessary to compete collegiately — rowing is generally not a lucrative industry after graduation.
“There’s no money in the sport, and I was always planning on going to college,” Dean said. “The cool thing about rowing is that usually the most competitive programs are also the top academic schools, so it’s a great opportunity.”
The NCAA allows five official recruiting visits to high school seniors who aspire to row in college. While Dean took all five, he never saw himself rowing for any school other than Harvard.
“There’s really no other school that performs at the same standard academically and athletically that Harvard does,” Dean said. “It was pretty much my top choice all along, and after my visit I knew for sure.”
Last fall, Dean contributed immediately for the Crimson. The Sarasota native played an integral role in the top three competitions for Harvard, helping the team to a second place finish at Eastern Sprints and a third place finish at the national championship. The Crimson, with the aid of Dean, narrowly missed out on a sweep of the top three boats in the Harvard-Yale competition after the second and third Crimson boats came out ahead while Dean’s top boat lost by only four seconds.
“Every year the team seems to get better,” Dean said. “Winning those three races is definitely the goal. A few years ago we placed fifth at nationals, then fourth, and now third. To see the team grow its legacy and be a part of that is exciting.”
On a team as prolific as Harvard, rowers stepping away from the sport is not that common. Naturally, the only thing that could draw Dean away was an opportunity even more profound: the upcoming 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. Dean chose to postpone his next three years at Harvard in order to vie for a spot to represent the U.S. rowing team at the Olympics. Dean’s best shot will be in a bigger boat where there are more spots: the four or the eight. Contrary to making the team in a single, for which an official Olympic trial race is held, selections for the bigger boats is done by a coach after a rigorous process that has already begun in Oakland, California.
The selection process started this past summer with the U.S. competing at an Olympic qualifier event in Austria to be able to bring a team in each boat category. The U.S. was able to earn spots at the Olympics in all boats, and Dean contributed to the success of the four, and being a part of that team may slightly help his bid to making the Olympic team.
“Of course it’s still open to anyone in the selection process and nothing is going to be handed to anyone because of past achievements,” Dean said. “But it was obviously helpful to have been a part of success like that on such a crucial stage.”
Dean is currently living in an apartment with two other rowers trying out for the team. After spending the morning on the water, they each focus on improving their technical aspects and individual fitness. Realistically, decisions for the Olympic team will not be finalized until late spring. Until then, Dean will continue to spend each day fighting to stay in the mix, which has already dwindled down to sixteen.
“Last year when I was competing for Harvard all I thought about the whole year was how can I help our team be successful at Eastern Sprints, nationals, and Harvard-Yale,” Dean said. “It’s pretty different here because each day I have to find a way to be successful. It can be stressful.”
Although parts of the selection process are somewhat unfamiliar for Dean, this weekend he will find himself in an atmosphere he knows well. The group of Olympic contenders are in Cambridge this weekend, splitting into two eight boats for the Head of the Charles.
“I don’t know which eight I’ll be in or who else will be in my boat yet,” Dean said. “But I know I’m going to be there which is exciting.”
No matter the outcome of Dean’s Olympic quest, he will resume rowing for the Crimson next fall as a sophomore.
“Being a rower at Harvard while also getting to shoot for the Olympics is definitely an opportunity I’m grateful for,” Dean said. “Everyone has been so supportive. Chasing my goal meant stepping away temporarily but I’m definitely always proud to say I row at Harvard.”

For the Harvard and Radcliffe crew teams, the biggest test of this year’s fall season will be the first test of the season — and it will take place in front of several thousand spectators on the Crimson’s home river.
The Head of the Charles, the world’s largest two-day rowing event, will be held this weekend for the 55th time. Thousands are expected to attend as some of the top rowers from around the country flock to the Charles River for a regatta that is defined as much by its pomp as it is its show of athletic prowess.
For Harvard, which will race all four of its crew teams, the weekend is a chance to start the fall season on a high note.
“I think it is a tone-setting regatta, and I think we’re set up well to have a really strong performance this weekend,” said junior Brigid Kennedy, who races for the Radcliffe lightweight team. “We’ve all been working really hard and we have a wonderful group of freshmen this year that just came in. I think we have a lot of power and we’re ready to see how it stacks up against everyone else.”
Harvard’s Head of the Charles performance last year was highlighted by a first-place finish by the Radcliffe lightweight fours boat. This fall, they are hoping to pick up where they left off.
“Coming off of last year, we’re very excited to see how this year goes,” Kennedy said. “I think we’ve made a lot of strides as a team this fall and I think everyone’s really excited to see how we stack up against the other lightweight crews.”
Kennedy, who is racing in her sixth Head of the Charles, was in the winning lightweight fours boat last year. She describes the victory as “truly a magical experience.”
“It was one of the most fun races I have ever competed in,” she said. “A number of us in the boat cried a little bit. To win the Head of the Charles is one of the most rewarding achievements in this sport and we were just so proud.”
The men’s heavyweight team finished fifth overall in the championship eights race last fall. According to junior Ethan Seder, the Harvard-Yale rivalry is a fixation for the men’s heavyweights at the Head of the Charles.
“It’s a good season if we beat Yale, and it’s a bad season if we lose to Yale,” Seder said. “We’re always excited about the opportunity to go up against them and show who’s the faster team.”
Harvard finished three spots behind the second-place Bulldogs last fall.
“Last year was pretty interesting racing conditions,” Seder said. “It was very windy and pretty difficult to get down the course. … We were pretty even with [Yale] for most of the race, except for one portion where they managed to take a significant margin out of us. This year we’re looking to press closer and hopefully to beat Yale.”
The men’s lightweight team is hoping to bounce back after finishing sixth in the both the eights and fours races last fall. Junior Drake Deuel says that the men’s lightweight team has “worked harder than ever this semester in training leading up to Head of the Charles.”
“We’ve done a lot of things differently this year,” Deuel said. “Our head coach, Billy Boyce, took note of some things that we maybe didn’t do as well last year and I think we’ve been training a lot more. We’ve done an extra probably three sessions on the water a week compared to what we did last year. So we’ve changed things up a lot. We’ve changed the selection process for our top boat so that hopefully we can have a better result that we did last year. We’re pretty confident that we can.”
Deuel says that a strong performance in the Head of the Charles would be crucial in kicking off what the Crimson hope will be a bounce-back season.
“Rowing is almost entirely mental,” Deuel said. “It’s physical in what you do on the water, but the results come from mentality and team culture. ... I think that for us, our first race coming back this year, we really want to put down a good performance so that we can look back on that over the long winter leading into our spring season and be confident in what we’re doing and know that it’s going to work.”
For the Radcliffe heavyweight team, the Head of the Charles is a chance to get out on the water and race hard, but “it’s not necessarily indicative of what’s going to happen in the spring,” according to 34-year head coach Liz O’Leary.
“Training has been terrific,” O’Leary, a former Olympian, said. “Our racing season is in the spring, so we look long-range to that as our target. The Head of the Charles is a really fun fall festival and a really great weekend of racing for everybody. It really is just that; it doesn’t necessarily indicate how anyone — us or anyone else — will be in the spring. For the fall, it’s a great opportunity to get out and do what we love to do, which is race.”
The Radcliffe heavyweight team finished 12th in the championship eights and 11th in the championship fours in last year’s Head of the Charles.
The crowd that turns out to watch the regatta is by far the biggest that college crew teams encounter. Rowers say that the spectators serve as extra motivation, not added pressure.
“We love the fans,” Seder said. “It’s great to feel support, especially in rowing — a sport that doesn’t necessarily have the most school support and community support. It’s great to have everyone come around us. Sometimes it can be stressful because when you know people are watching you it always puts stress on your performance. But at the end of the day it will fuel you to go faster and the excitement you hear on the banks — people cheering for you — just drives everyone to work harder and push faster.”
Kennedy says that the Radcliffe lightweight team concurs.
“We all adore the Head of the Charles,” Kennedy said. “In the Head of the Charles, for almost the entirety of the race, you can hear people shouting and yelling, which is so much fun. It’s a huge honor to be able to race on our home river — somewhere that we know as well as we do. We know every turn on this river, so that’s always very fun.”
Asked if the extra attention can add pressure, Kennedy was quick to swat down the notion that the spectators create a mental burden.
“I don’t personally think of it that way,” she said. “I think it’s fun to have the energy to work off of. This is usually a quiet sport, so to have all of these people here is just a very exciting time for us. I think it can be a little overwhelming at first, but this will be my sixth Head of the Charles, so at this point, I’m fairly used to the crowds here. The chaos is a fun chaos, it’s not an overwhelming chaos.”

Led by senior captains Molly Lesser and Maria Boyle, Harvard women’s lightweight crew will look to open the season strong at the Head of the Charles Regatta this weekend. In advance of the regatta, Lesser and Boyle have worked hard to facilitate efficient practices and effective communication across the squad’s members.
“[Lesser] and I work together to communicate between our teammates and the coaches,” Boyle said. “[We] make sure that everyone knows what's going on.”
In the most collaborative of team sports, communication could not be more important.
“We organize team circles talks, which is when the entire team gets together outside of the boathouse and we discuss things like the race weekends, and everything that’s gonna be happening,” Lesser explained. “We will check in [our coaches] after practice, and these last few days, it's like, ‘okay, anything else you want us to do’? And they keep saying, ‘just bring the energy and get everyone excited.’”
If these instructions from the coaches are any metric by which to measure job performance, their teammates seem to think that their captains are passing with flying colors. As the coaches push the captains, the captains transfer that motivation onto the players.
“I think [Lesser and Boyle] have been great liaison to our coaches to make sure that we're pushing our training as hard as we can without pushing to injury,” junior Brigid Kennedy explained. “It's a fine line between training at the top level and retraining, so I think they've been excellent in terms of keeping communication open.”
In her fourth and final year of the squad, Boyle feels as though she has taken on more responsibility as a captain and as one of the older members of the team, even as the entire team does the same.
“I think that naturally as you get older on the team, you want to take on more ownership over results and ownership of how the team is doing,” Boyle said. “But that's not to say that freshmen or sophomores don't feel that way either.”
As part of this added responsibility, Boyle and Lesser also strive to foster a sense of community among the team members both on and off the water. Their efforts have proven helpful, especially for the team’s first-years.
“[Over the summer] they both reached out to all the freshmen and they talked to us on the phone and answered any questions,” first-year Alexa Jacques said. “[It] was really great going in and already kind of knowing somebody, and then also having an idea of what the team would be like.”
These efforts have not been lost on the fresh recruits.
“In general, I just think they're really great leaders,” Jacques added. “They're super approachable, they're super helpful, and especially to all the underclassmen and the first years, they've been really welcoming and making sure that we feel like we're part of the team.”
 With the pressures of the daunting challenge of starting a college career, both on the team and in the classroom, the open environment made its mark on the incoming first-years.
“I think [Boyle and Lesser] have been very, very good at integrating our first-years this year.” Kennedy added. “It's been a super welcoming environment [and] they've made sure everyone feels included.”
Also key to Lesser and Boyle’s leadership is the mutual respect the two share for each other as co-captains, teammates, and friends.
“[Boyle] is very trustworthy — she'll get stuff done and we've, we communicate a lot and about very different things, but we don't always see eye to eye and everything.” Lesser said. “But I always feel like I can really like voice my opinion and talk things out.”
This admiration is clearly a two-way street. Even if Lesser refrains from saying so herself, Boyle is quick to point out her partner’s laurels.
“I think that [Lesser] is a really amazing mentor to people on the team. And I think that she leads by example and therefore people are really attracted to her quiet confidence.” Boyle said. “She's not someone to be boastful or anything like that. But I think people seek her out because they know that she is such a strong rower and such a great teammate and therefore seek her advice.”
Boyle and Lesser see a bright outlook for this year’s squad, lauding the team’s work ethic and new talented first-years as reasons to be excited for the year ahead.
“We have a lot of really past freshmen that came in,” said Boyle of the team’s new additions. “So it's a pretty exciting time for us and they're really contributing to our top end speed, which is super great.”
All of this preparation will hopefully pay off on the Charles.
“We're looking to showcase our speed and go up against some of the fastest teams in the country on our home court.” Boyle said. “It should be a good race.”

Many dream to one day wear the home country’s flag on our backs during an international sports competition, but only a small minority of us ever get the opportunity. An even smaller minority ever get to walk away from these competitions victorious.
But for junior Hope Cessford, a member of Radcliffe Heavyweight Crew from Durham, England, this dream became a reality this past summer at the U-23 World Rowing Championships in Florida.
“I knew we had speed, but I didn’t know we were quite that fast,” said Cessford in regards to her boat this past July. “We definitely weren’t the favorites.”
Cessford competed for Team Great Britain’s Women’s Four, rowing in three races. The four rowers came second to Team USA in the first heat but later advanced to the final after a second race. And then came the moment.
“I don’t think I’ve ever felt more ill than when I was sitting at the start of the World Championship Final,” said Cessford jokingly.
Even under an immense amount of pressure, the Harvard junior led her team to a gold medal in the 2,000-meter race, finishing with a time 06:34.22. This international success did not happen overnight; the gold medal is the product of years of dedication and hard work. Hope began rowing in the summer of 2013, a year removed from the London 2012 Olympics.
“U.K. schools had this big push to get more kids in sports, especially after [the London 2012 Olympics], so we had people come into our school to talk with us,” said Cessford. “We did things like netball, basketball, and rowing.”
Cessford excelled at most of the sports she tried, but she was naturally drawn to rowing. When she started at the Durham Amateur Rowing Club in her hometown, she was immediately welcomed by an incredibly supportive network of coaches that worked closely with her to channel her natural talents in the sport to success on the water. After a few years of rowing in England, she joined the junior national team and competed in multiple countries, including the Netherlands, specifically Rotterdam, in 2016.
Her initial success back home led her to Radcliffe Crew at Harvard, and since being in Cambridge, it has been quite the change.
“It’s definitely different here, but I love it. At home, I predominantly trained on my own in a single,” said Cessford. “At Harvard, I have such a great group of girls around me. I love training as part of a team, it’s just so fun to come in every day and have that group.”
Having such a close-knit community at a place like Harvard has been crucial for Cessford. It has helped her become more confident as an athlete and as a person. She’s developed trust in herself, which has enabled her to accomplish such lofty goals as winning a world championship.
And while the competition from other teams, both at the international and the collegiate level, has encouraged much of this personal growth, it has been her time with teammates that’s helped her the most.
“I love challenging myself and my teammates to be the best athletes we can possibly be. I think my teammates are the strongest competition that I could possibly have,” said Cessford. “I’ve loved being in an environment where we challenge each other, but also support each other.”
Cessford also noted that since her accomplishments this past summer, the dynamic between her and her teammates has not changed. It is this mutual respect and trust in one another that has helped Hope, and her other teammates, blossom at Harvard.
While rowing for Harvard does not allow her to have too much extra time for other out-of-class endeavors, the Crimson rower has found another family in Cambridge with her concentration department, Human Evolutionary Biology. She went into college with the expectation of studying Earth Sciences, but after coming across this department, she found her new passion.
“I love how it combines all of my interests; I can still do a lot of science, and I can still do lots of writing, and some anthropology,” said the junior. “There are so many amazing faculty members in the department, I can’t even explain how great they are. I’m in a class about social behavior and game theory at the moment which is really cool, and I also took a class last year about human nature which completely changed the way I think about life.”
It has not been the easiest transition moving from northern England to Cambridge, but after adjusting to the constant flow of academic work and a heavy training load, Harvard has begun to feel more like a second home for Hope. However, it has been finding a home in these two communities, the women’s heavyweight crew team and in the Human Evolutionary Biology department, that has made the transition and decision to come to Harvard completely worth it.
Looking forward to this weekend at the Head of The Charles Regatta, Cessford says the team has multiple goals.
“The big thing that we as a team focus on for racing is having fun. I think that’s what makes Radcliffe such a special thing to be a part of,” said Cessford. “Obviously, we want to do really well, but I think at the forefront of this weekend is taking the whole atmosphere in, and challenging ourselves to be the best we can be.”
Having the opportunity to not only compete, but also to train on such a historic river like the Charles has been an incredible experience for Cessford. She stated that while it can sometimes be easy to forget to appreciate where she is, her friends from England often remind her of how fortunate she is to be in place so rich with stories from the past.
For the rest of the year, Cessford has sights set on the NCAA Championships for the Crimson team, which the team competed in last year. Individually, she hopes to compete at the 2020 U-23 World Championships in Slovenia. For an already accomplished student-athlete like herself, these goals seem well within reach.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When calculating Ivy League standings, non-conference games are given no weight. From the vantage point of an Ancient Eight title, then, Harvard’s football game at Holy Cross this weekend means nothing.
If precedent is any indication, the Crimson (3-1, 2-0 Ivy) might be thankful come Saturday. The Crusaders have been an unforeseen difficult opponent on the schedule. Last season, Harvard’s win came in the form of a game-winning field goal from senior Jake McIntyre as time expired. The time before, in 2016, the Crimson lost by 10.
While Saturday’s game is the 71st meeting between the two teams, and the Crimson leads the series 43-25-2, Holy Cross (3-3, 1-0 Patriot) has won four of the last five home games against Harvard. Meanwhile, the Crimson’s loss to San Diego is the only other time this season the team played outside of Harvard Stadium.
“They are better team than they were a year ago,” coach Tim Murphy said. “They’re playing at home. They’re playing at homecoming. It will be a big crowd. It will be a very emotional, intense Holy Cross football team we play. We’re going to have to play better than we did a week ago to get a victory.”
The Crimson arrives in Worcester, Mass., propelled by the momentum of a three-game win streak. After dropping its first contest to San Diego by eight points, the team has not faltered again, downing Brown, Howard, and Cornell. The wins came by margins of 35, 45, and 13, respectively.
“We handled business at home,” said junior defensive back Isaiah Wingfield “We lost on the road the first game of the season. Now it’s our chance to be road warriors.”
Harvard’s offensive explosion has propelled it to the top of the division in scoring offense, averaging 40.5 points per game. The team also leads the division in first downs per game and red-zone offense.
The stat leaders for the Crimson offensive front are juniors quarterback Jake Smith and running back Devin Darrington. Smith is averaging a 238.5 yards per game with 11 touchdowns through the team’s four games. When dished the ball, Darrington averages 92.8 yards per game having barreled his way to five touchdowns on the ground.
When Smith drops to pass, he’s been favoring senior Cody Chrest, senior Jack Cook, and junior B.J. Watson. The trio has 44 grabs for eight touchdowns and 626 yards.
When other teams’ quarterbacks have taken their three-step drop, they’ve been largely unsuccessful at converting. Harvard leads the nation and division in team sacks. Sophomore Truman Jones is third in the nation and first in the Ivy League in tackles for a loss. He also leads the league in sacks.
This dominance will face a test in Holy Cross quarterback Connor Degenhardt. The one opponent in common the two teams have is Brown, and the six foot six inch junior put up 315 yards and four touchdowns in the Crusaders’ 47-31 routing of their Ivy League opponent last week. That’s five more points than the Crimson managed in it’s own contest against the Bears two weeks ago.
“They’re going to pass that ball, they throw the rock,” Wingfield said “I’m just excited to compete, make some plays, and just come back with the win.”
Given Degenhardt’s and his success throughout the season, it’s no wonder that the team hardly runs. The team’s leading rusher is Domenic Cozier, a senior that averages just 48.4 yards per game. Even Degenhardt has more rushing touchdowns than his leading running back, with two.
On Saturday, Cozier will likely run for even less. Harvard leads the nation and league in rushing defense. In addition, to defense, the Crimson has been stellar on special teams through four games. The team leads the nation in blocked punts.
When Degenhardt throws, he’s not particular about where he passes so long as the man that grabs the toss is wearing purple. Four Holy Cross receivers have over ten catches on the season — Tenio Ayeni (25), Spencer Gilliam (22), Derek Mountain (18), and Ayir Asante (11).
On Harvard’s side, each win is important as Murphy marches closer to becoming the winningest coach in Ivy League history. Right now, the Crimson coach is three wins away from passing Carm Cozza of Yale.
“We had no idea honestly, that’s great,” Wingfield said. “That’s exciting that we’re going to get that for him, hopefully in the next two weeks. Coach Murphy isn’t the type to brag about something like that so this is the first I’m hearing of it, but we’re going to go get that for him.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Upon walking into Annenberg, the first thing a freshman sees is a sign that reads, “Please park your SCOOTER at the back of the dining hall between the two statues. Thank you!” A look to the right and one sees an army of scooters parked against the back wall. It does not take long to figure out that the scooters mostly belong to athletes.
Although this is a new phenomenon on Harvard’s campus and the sign in Annenberg was just added this school year, the athletes claim they are useful for a variety of reasons. First-year men’s basketball player Idan Tretout says he mostly uses his for convenience, and that it will especially come in handy when it starts to get cold outside.
“Instead of a 15 minute walk, it’s going to be a four minute scooter ride,” Tretout said.
Tretout’s scooter is electric, so he expends minimal energy when he crosses the river to go to the gym. While only a couple of basketball players owned scooters when Tretout bought his in mid-September, now four players do.
While scooters are gradually becoming more popular on the men’s basketball team, men’s varsity heavy-weight crew is a different story. On a team where bikes are the common mode of transportation, first-year Tom Horncastle received his share of banter when he came to practice with a scooter. His teammates originally made fun of him and lightly threatened to slash his tires, and Horncastle does not really blame them.
“It’s almost as if it’s a kid’s toy used by big athletes, and so it’s kind of ironic in that sense,” Horncastle said. “Now they’ve kind of accepted it.”
Even so, Horncastle sticks with his scooter because he has valid reasons for owning one over a bike. He began the year with a knee injury, and a sophomore gave him a scooter for free to alleviate his knee pain and help him get across the river. Also, since bikes are more expensive than non-electric scooters, he figured a free scooter was an excellent deal.
Another member of the team even bought a scooter himself. Despite this, Horncastle recognizes that bikes are both faster and more durable in the snow, and he thinks that they’re probably a better long-term investment.
Scooters are evidently growing in demand, but some believe that they have more cons than pros. First-year men’s soccer player Galen Lewis uses a bike and argues that they’re the better purchase.
“You can’t lock up a scooter,” Lewis said. “There’s bike racks literally everywhere outside of any building on campus, so I just lock up my bike.”
Athletes with scooters have to carry the scooters into their classes. Lewis also says that scooters are not as helpful as they appear because they do not truly make crossing the river that much easier; they are only slightly faster than walking, while bikes save much more time and completely take the pressure off an athlete’s feet.
“If you’re playing a sport, scootering can actually make you pretty sore after a while,” Lewis said.
Lewis says the men’s soccer team is a mixed bag when it comes to transportation. He guesses that approximately a third of the team uses scooters, a third uses bikes, and the remaining third either uses skateboards or walks.
First-year Sarah Burn of varsity sailing purchased a non-electric scooter to alleviate her morning commute to team lift at 7:20 a.m. and attests to the fact that it’s a worthy purchase. However, she didn’t get the idea from her teammates, but from other freshman athletes. In fact, no upperclassmen on the team own scooters at all, but many of the freshmen do.
“In previous years, scooters weren’t popular with athletes,” Burns said. “First-year athletes are changing that, and maybe some upperclassmen will be joining that trend.”
Perhaps she’s right and every dining hall will soon have scooters parked against the wall, but for now, it’s Annenberg’s burden.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard went into Columbus Day Weekend with new-found optimism: the squad was coming off a 3-0 win against Brown (9-6, 1-4 Ivy)  that snapped an eight game losing streak and garnered the team its first league win of the season. Despite the team’s success in Rhode Island, this past weekend the Crimson (3-11, 1-4) only managed to win one set in two games in New York, falling to Columbia on Friday and Cornell on Saturday. As such, the team ended its stretch on the road with a 1-4 record in Ivy League play.
HARVARD 0, COLUMBIA 3
Both Harvard and Columbia (10-5, 3-2) went into Friday’s game hoping to ride the momentum from each of their previous games — first wins for both teams in Ivy League play this season — into another victory. In that effort, only Columbia was successful.
On offense, the Crimson looked like a different squad than the team that had swept Brown days prior. It performed a lack-luster kill percentage of .099, significantly lower than its impressive .343 kill percentage against Brown.
While the squad limited its errors to 12 against Brown, Harvard conceded a whopping 21 errors against Columbia.
Columbia just bested the Crimson in the first set, eking out a 25-23 win. After the first set, Columbia significantly cleaned up its play in the next two sets, limiting its errors and improving the precession of its kills. Harvard lost the second set by five points and the third by 10.
The Crimson finally managed to bring its kill percentage above .100 by the third set, albeit much too late to salvage a single game. Sophomore Jaimie Rao led Harvard’s attack with 10 kills, her third match with a double-digit mark in the category. Freshman Katie Vorhies also contributed on offense, putting up five kills. In the back court, junior lebaro Sandra Zeng had 10 digs.
HARVARD 1, CORNELL 3
The Crimson concluded its road trip with a loss on Saturday in Ithaca, where the team faced a dominant Cornell (12-2, 5-0). Going into the game, the Big Red was undefeated in Ivy League play and looking to extend its winning streak to double digits.
Coming off of an unsuccessful offensive performance the day before, Harvard was uncharacteristically passive on offense in the first set. The squad attempted only 28 attacks, its least in any set of the weekend, resulting in only seven kills. Meanwhile, Cornell’s kill percentage of .500 propelled the Big Red to a 25-17 victory in the first set.
The Crimson offense appeared ressorected in the second set. The team fired a total of 35 attempts at net to improve its kill percentage to .286, its best yet of the weekend. The Crimson’s aggressiveness enabled the squad to get within two points of Cornell at the close of the second set.
Harvard finally outperformed Cornell in the third set to force the game into a fourth. Zeng dazzled her opponents at the service line, serving up two consecutive aces early on in the third set to finish the night with a total of four. Zeng was also dominant in the back court, leading Cornell with 12 digs.
In this pivotal third set, Harvard prevailed by recording three more kills than Cornell and conceding one fewer error.
Errors, however, would ultimately lead to the Crimson’s downfall in both of its matchups in New York. In the final set of the weekend, Harvard conceded seven errors in a 25-20 loss. Cornell won four of its five final points due to Crimson errors committed.
Despite the loss, the Crimson’s attackers contributed aggressive performances at the net. Vorhies led Harvard’s offense, recording a career-high 14 kills. Junior Mindie Mabry complemented her teammate’s performance with 12 kills, recording double digits in the category in her fifth match this season. Co-captain junior Evelyn Gray supported her teammates’ performances with nine kills.
The Crimson will have two more opportunities to muscle its way up the league standings this upcoming weekend, when they host Princeton (8-6, 4-1) on Friday at 7 p.m. and Penn (8-6, 1-4) on Saturday at 5 p.m.

We’ve all heard of RBF, but on the walk to class you’ve no doubt passed ROTGF (Resting On The Grind Face), RSF (Resting Scooter Face), and RWWISF (Resting Wait, Where is Sever? Face). Harvard is a small school, but sometimes all the faces that pass blur together. That’s why we’ve compiled some of the most common resting faces on campus.
Resting Networking Face
Their smile looks like a pose for a LinkedIn headshot. They look put together, ready for anything, and also like somebody who is about to drop some hot financial advice. They still shake your hand even though you’ve been roommates for two years, and their wall decor is a picture from their summer internship — signed by their boss, of course. Networking never sleeps, and you’re pretty sure that even when this person is resting they’re actually just practicing for their upcoming consulting interview.
Resting Can You Help Me With My Pset? Face
This “friend” only wants you for your brain and/or knowledge gleaned from actually going to office hours. Most commonly found in Cabot Library after 10 p.m. or at the start of your massive lecture class, they’ll hop from victim to victim until somebody helps them debug their code. They look harmless, smiley even, but don’t be fooled: They’re desperate and will do anything to complete this pset.
Resting Social Face
They’re ready at any moment to flash a smile and ask you what you’re up to this weekend. And even though you’re not likely to see them any time before noon, they’re always down for a 2 a.m. run to Felipes or to actually go out to the Quad with you. You’ve never seen them study with less than five people, and they’re the number one most likely to sleep through their 9 a.m. class.
Resting Thesising Face
Also known as Resting Senioritis Face, these students have been around the block. You think your paper is long? They have to write 50 pages more than you. Though not unkind, they’re likely to have a dead look in their eyes. But come springtime you’ll see them on Widener steps, and their RTF will be replaced with a RIOHF (Resting I’m Out of Here Face).
RF
They’re just resting. Literally taking a nap. It doesn't matter whether it’s a 5-person section or 500-person lecture — they’re curled up in their seat with chin in hand. Hopefully they don’t snore, but even if they do, we’d all kind of like to be them.
Turns out we’ve all probably seen a RNF at a job fair or a RSF in the Mather JCR. Maybe take a peek in the mirror and see what kind of resting face you have. But regardless of what type of RF you are, at least you’re not alone.
