After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A few weeks ago, more than one thousand students, faculty, staff, and community allies stood out in support of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, the largest labor union on campus. HUCTW represents library staff, receptionists, and research assistants—workers on whom students depend daily for full and consistent access to University resources. These employees have been engaged in an ongoing negotiations process drawn out since April, and have been working without a contract since July 1.
The strong demonstration of support the union received at its Sept. 27 stand-outs should motivate HUCTW to stay strong in its commitment to the workers it represents, and to actively reach out to the broader Harvard community for support during continued negotiations with the University. Without the work of thousands of HUCTW members, the University would effectively shut down; these employees keep Harvard functioning on a daily basis and are a valuable resource worth investing in by the University.
The Crimson Staff urged Harvard to grant meaningful wage raises as part of a new deal with HUCTW, and to expedite the broader process of contract negotiation. According to data from the Harvard Management Company, the University’s endowment has held steady in the gains it has made in the past two years, far above levels seen during the recession. Workers should benefit from Harvard’s increased economic stability in the form of wage increases, of the kind HUCTW members voted to forgo during their last round of contract negotiations in 2010 due to claims of financial uncertainty from the University. Accompanying Harvard’s return to more solid financial footing should not just be a restoration of annual wage increases above the rate of inflation, but also a University commitment to insulating workers’ jobs from economic fluctuation.
After the financial crisis in 2008, Harvard laid off hundreds of clerical workers in an attempt to cut costs. Just last spring, the Harvard Library suggested that its staff would be significantly smaller; 65 workers took an early retirement package offered by the University and left their jobs, while six more were eventually laid off. Moving forward, the immediate response to a change in University finances or to an uncertain economic situation should not simply be to hold workers’ feet to the fire with the threat of mass layoffs. Harvard should signal its commitment to the livelihoods of its employees by strengthening efforts to invest in and develop its human capital just as carefully as it does its financial resources. In conversations about fair jobs, wage increases and job security go hand in hand; not only should the University agree to wage increases appropriate to its improved financial health, but should also include a no-layoffs clause in the eventual negotiated contract.
While the conversation about wage increases is directly relevant to current HUCTW goals (and has dominated the public focus of both the Crimson editorial page and the University itself), the issues at play in the ongoing contract negotiations are much broader.
Harvard’s public statement on the negotiations focused exclusively on wage increases while not acknowledging other issues at stake with the new contract which directly impact the daily lives of the 4,600 HUCTW members and their families, as well as retirees. This larger picture of current negotiations includes three major tenets as put forth by the union, which all ought to be included as subjects of public discussion and awareness. It is important to remember that both healthcare coverage and membership in HUCTW’s bargaining unit—in addition to wage increases—are major issues at stake in current negotiations, and are of interest not only to current HUCTW members but also to union retirees and current non-unionized Harvard employees.
After a six-month standstill, it is clear that putting negotiations with the University back on track will require continued action from HUCTW. Coordinating mass public stand-outs is a strong start in terms of campus organizing, but union membership must continue to be mobilized in order to ensure a successful contract is brought back. While employees have been working for three months since the expiration of their previous contract earlier this summer, this is not an unfamiliar situation. In 1992, negotiations between Harvard and the union stretched on for six months after the previous contract expired. To ensure the quick and timely realization of its goals, HUCTW must continue to engage the Harvard community and be willing to expand its action repertoire beyond standing out to more dynamic initiatives.
Last November, Harvard custodial staff, represented by SEIU 615, negotiated a successful contract just as their previous one was about to expire. The janitors, along with students and community allies, staged rallies around campus and voted to authorize a strike if an amenable deal was not reached after a month-long standstill; just hours before the strike would have gone into effect, a new contract was negotiated with the University. That union took home a successful contract, complete with an increase in wages.
Levels of attendance and enthusiasm at HUCTW’s stand-out demonstrations indicate that it has the human resources available to press for a fair contract addressing the priorities of its members. One hopes the University will take notice and respond with offers that grant employees on campus appropriate wages, job security, and benefits commensurate with the value they contribute to campus every day.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As far as local economic stimulus goes, $60 million is not bad. That lofty figure is the combined sum that U.S. Senate candidates Elizabeth Warren and Scott Brown have raised this for their campaigns this election cycle. Temporary boons to ad companies and political consultants aside, it is hard to see how this excessive spending benefits anybody in the long run. The Brown-Warren race demonstrates the absurdity of our current campaign-finance system. At this point, all the airtime is bought up, the radio-waves are saturated, and there’s hardly a voter in the Commonwealth who couldn’t recite each candidate’s pitch by heart. Our current system of private campaign finance is a wild misallocation of resources that simply raises prices for consultants and ad production companies without any perceptible benefits for voters. We advocate widespread public finance reform, putting an end to this inefficient system.
Needless to say, $60 million is far in excess of the socially optimal campaign cost for a single senate campaign in a state with only 4.2 million registered voters. That breaks down to almost $15 in campaign spending per registered voter—a candidate could probably purchase votes directly for less. What’s more, it’s far in excess of the average cost of a senate seat. From 1986 to 2010, average campaign expenditure on a senate seat hovered between $5 and $10 million—well below the roughly $30 million per candidate this cycle.
At its current level, it’s not even clear that this much fund raising is benefiting the candidates. As political consultant Tom Domke notes, “There’s only so much TV or radio time they can buy.” Indeed, private campaign finance has all the trappings of an arms race: Each party ups its arsenal of campaign funds for fear of being outspent without a clear advantage to either party. The result is that an inordinate amount of money is funneled into an activity whose only intrinsic value is, at best, making voters aware of candidates’ platforms. In practice, insofar as this goal is fulfilled at all, it can happen well below $60 million dollars.
Even if we choose not to approach the question of whether it is right for candidates with deep-pocketed donors to have an advantage in getting their message out, it’s hard to see how the current system benefits either party. Going into a race, it’s often hard to predict who will have the final cash advantage. Although Republicans are known for garnering donations (sometimes indirectly) of jaw-dropping proportions, Democrats have certainly held their own. In 2008, then-Senator Obama enjoyed the cash advantage, and he may well out-raise his opponent again. If neither party is the clear winner in the private fundraising rat-race, it’s hard to see why either would be against widespread public finance reform.
Of course, the great elephant in the room on this topic is Supreme Court precedent. Current case law holds that money is equivalent to speech, a fact which makes campaign finance reform nearly impossible. While we support public finance, it would need to come part-and-parcel with a constitutional amendment reversing that line of precedent.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I say that I am “pre-law” in both senses of the word. I envision myself in law school eventually, and I often envision myself in a society before laws were introduced. In short, it’s tough to be a libertarian fascinated with lawmaking. Of the many issues I wrangle with, eminent domain is the concept I’d most like to consider today.
Eminent domain is a legal term for the public takeover of private property for a certain municipal function in exchange for adequate compensation to the owner.  It is tough for a libertarian to recognize the necessity of eminent domain. How lucky it is, then, for this libertarian to attend a university (the only university to my knowledge) exempt from eminent domain.
If you were unaware that Harvard is legally exempt from eminent domain, you are not alone. Few know about Harvard’s special status in the Massachusetts Constitution, and fewer remember the times when Harvard has invoked it.
The Massachusetts Constitution declares that “the President and Fellows of Harvard College…shall have, hold, use, exercise and enjoy, all the powers, authorities, rights, liberties, privileges, immunities and franchises, which they now have…forever.” To sum up, Harvard has the same privileges now that it had in 1780.
What exactly are those “powers… liberties… privileges, [and] immunities”? Among other things, Harvard, like other universities, is exempt from property taxes owing to its status as a non-profit corporation under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. However, only Harvard is ostensibly exempt from eminent domain.
This is as far as the facts go, and only lore is left.  Here, however, is how the story goes. When, in 1974, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority sought to extend the Red Line beyond Harvard Square, the state began plans to dig underneath Harvard Yard. They got so far as to build a platform approximately underneath Wigglesworth Hall. In fact, you may see the ghost station when you ride the T, on the right side of the train as it slows down and nears the platform at Harvard station. However, Harvard would not tolerate the thought of a tunnel below its sacred grounds, disturbing the scholarly peace and quiet of the Yard. Allegedly, Harvard hired a team of lawyers who took the MBTA to court. According to lore, they presented before the judge a glass encased letter granting Harvard exemption from eminent domain signed by General George Washington.
As for the veracity of the story, I have not found substantive proof other than repeated versions of the story told in forums. However, it is true that Harvard inexplicably convinced the MBTA to build around the Yard despite an astronomical increase in the cost of construction.
Mentions of the Red Line extension in the Crimson are cryptic. The earliest report states that two of the three proposals for the extension called for digging under Harvard Yard.  Few mentions are made again until 1978, four years later, when construction begins, conveniently, around the Yard.
This is not the first time Harvard invoked its special status. In 1970, just eight years prior, committee hearings were held when several state politicians proposed taking over Harvard Stadium via eminent domain and converting it into a stadium for the Patriots. The Patriots were only in their second year in the NFL, and the proposal was packed with populist appeal. Politicians could simultaneously denounce Harvard as a bastion of elite pretensions and appeal to the Patriotism­ of Americans and football fans alike.
But Harvard President Nathan M. Pusey ’28 flatly denied the Patriots use of the stadium. University officials interviewed quietly conceded they would be “knocked: we'll just have to sit there and take it." However, owing to “certain provisions of the state c­onstitution [that] exempt Harvard from eminent domain proceedings,” the bill was eventually blocked.
It is at this point that I feel I should stop researching this topic, lest the men in black suits and Harvard bow ties come knocking at my door. Additionally, both my word limit and my midterms are fast approaching. Suffice it to say that Harvard is, like me, pre-law. Harvard is “pre-law” in the sense that Harvard predates the invention of our current legal system by about a century and a half. All in all, the University does occasionally act as a law unto itself.

Soon after Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi finished her stirring speech about the challenges of democratization in Burma at the Harvard Institute of Politics, she spoke about her decision to fight for Burma’s freedom despite seemingly insurmountable obstacles. “You’re more likely to lose confidence in yourself when you concentrate on yourself,” she said. “I think you have to focus on others. If you want to keep up your strength when you are working toward something, you have to learn not to think of yourself as the center of the world… you are just one working towards a goal with others.” Out of her one-hour public address, this idea was the one that resonated with me the most: Think about the big picture. Think about others. I am not at the center of the world.
As I listened to these words, I did start thinking about others. I thought about my parents and their immigration to this country from Burma, in hopes of giving me a better education and a better life, free from corruption, power outages, and rationed gasoline. They had to make so many personal and financial sacrifices to send me to piano and tennis lessons, drive me to my meetings, and position me for a bright future. I thought about the community members, teachers, and friends who encouragingly told me that I could and would make a great doctor one day. I thought about the elderly patients I saw while I was shadowing in a hospital, turned away because they could not afford their medical treatment. As I collected my thoughts and internalized Daw Suu’s advice, I realized that I should be and am empowered by the people around me. I hope one day to make them proud, to make them happy, and, as a doctor, to make them healthier.
At Harvard, through all the stress of papers, problem sets, and parties, it is easy to lose sight of our goals, and our vision for ourselves and the world we live in. While drinking coffee at 4 a.m. and tiredly re-doing our homework, it is also easy to begin doubting ourselves, to get bitter and impatient at the slow progress of our success. But Daw Suu’s speech made me reconsider what it actually means to be successful. One might argue that due to her house arrest, Daw Suu was not as “successful” as she could have been, in that she was unable to make sweeping legislative changes in Burma. Although her presence and tireless efforts to reach out to her supporters gave hope to Burmese citizens, without the ability to actively campaign, the scope of impact she could have had was constrained.
However, because of her dedication, conviction, and commitment to doing the “right thing,” her messages regarding democratization, human rights, and freedom earned her adoration and respect from the international and Burmese community. Daw Suu did succeed. She succeeded in mobilizing individuals all around the country and world to join her cause of transforming Burma into a freer, fairer nation. Most importantly, Daw Suu’s commitment arose from her genuine love for her country and the sincere hope to help bring about positive change.
At the end of the day, it is not the number of accolades one collects or the amount of recognition one garners that exclusively defines success. No, true accomplishment lies in one’s character, actions, and intentions. Listening to Daw Suu’s address was inspiring, invigorating and a much needed gentle reminder of the incredible power of passion and sincerity—for these can truly lead to concrete, actionable, and productive results. Her determined demeanor, peaceful platform, and self-discipline to continue fighting even in the bleakest of times made me evaluate my reactions to setbacks, and think about how I can improve myself.
We Harvard students are going to be an integral part of the future and I know, judging by the wonderful fellow students I have encountered over the past couple of years, that we will continue making a significant impact wherever we go. As global citizens and leaders of tomorrow, we bear great responsibility to give back to our communities, our nation, and possibly even our world. In this role, we may face many challenges that lead us to question the purpose of our work, and our desire to carry it through. During these times, following in Daw Suu’s footsteps, I hope that we can remember who we are, what we represent, and who we want to be. I hope we persevere by considering the greater community, and our role in the big picture. I hope that even when the challenges seem too great and the barriers to success too high, that we never lose faith in ourselves and lose sight of what inspired us in the first place.
When I tell people that I was born in Burma, I often hear, “I’m so sorry. I heard that was a war-torn country.” I am not sorry. As a Burmese-American student, I am proud to be Burmese and proud to see my home country taking steps towards democracy. Even more, I am proud to see such a strong, intelligent woman lead our country step-by-step to help its citizens obtain the freedoms they deserve. I am encouraged and inspired by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and will remember the important lesson she imparted on me. Think about the big picture. Think about others. We are not at the center of the world.

James Casebere, an accomplished post-modern photographer, laid out his philosophy of photography, which focuses around using empty space to evoke an emotional response from viewers, during his talk on Thursday night.
“I suppose you could say that, more often than not, emptiness is my subject,” Casebere, a visiting lecturer, said at the Carpenter Center. “I very consciously try to put the viewer in the image and imagine them in relation to the space that is in the image,” he later added.
Casebere often photographs model landscapes and scenes—intricately detailed yet sparse structures that he constructs to replicate particular kinds of buildings. Casebere then subjects these models to varying degrees of dramatic lighting and coloring.
His work has been displayed at a number of prominent museums, including the Whitney, The Guggenheim, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.
In his talk, Casebere presented a slideshow full of his most powerful photos and discussed their meanings. Many pieces were inspired by his childhood memories. These include “Bacillus Pestis,” based on his experience of watching Saturday morning cartoons, and “Warm Bed, Hot Coals,” grounded in childhood concerns about coal fires on Minnesotan streets during winter.
Another part of Casebere’s work was inspired by prisons in America, and their general sense of isolation. During this period, Casebere constructed many haunting pieces, including “Eastern State Penitentiary,” “Panopticon Prison,” “Sing Sing,” “Asylum,” “Two Bunk Cell,” and “Toilets,” among others.
This series was a favorite among audience members. “I thought the prison pictures were very powerful by letting you as the viewer experience the loneliness and the confinement of these spaces,” said Bill Deveney, a Cambridge resident.
The American suburb has also served as a focal point for Casebere’s work. “This series is partly about evoking the memories and history of the place, but much more about the present than the past,” he said.
These images were also quite striking to audience members, including Professor David Rodowick, chair of the VES Department. “I was surprised at what a powerful emotional response these images generated,” he said. “They lack human beings, yet they draw you in. The isolation implies that you as the viewer are meant to fill in the space. He carefully controls perspective to make you feel part of the image itself.”

Gerald Chow, the jewelry magnate who is currently suing an educational consultant for misusing the $2 million he paid him to help get his sons into Ivy League Schools, called upon the tutoring services of the same firm for his own coursework at the Harvard Kennedy School in 2007 and 2008.
Chow has brought a suit against educational consultant Mark J. Zimny of IvyAdmit Consulting Associates, LLC, a former Harvard lecturer and visiting assistant professor, who Chow alleges owes him over $2 million. Chow and his wife, Lily, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts in April 2010 claiming that Zimny took the money from them while purporting to help their sons gain spots at premier U.S. colleges.
Chow earned a Master in Public Administration at HKS through a one-year program between 2007 and 2008.
Court documents submitted by the Chows’ attorney, Kevin W. Clancy, include invoices sent to the Chows by Zimny’s educational consulting company IvyAdmit. The invoices indicate that Jane E.T. Cassie, who received a masters from the Graduate School of Education in 2010 and was affiliated with IvyAdmit, tutored Chow extensively while at HKS.
The invoices detail the many hours Cassie spent with Chow reviewing readings, conducting research, and editing papers for his courses at HKS. Receipts also show that she purchased course material for him at the Coop and made copies for him at Staples on JFK St.
David J. Gorman, Cassie’s attorney, said that she was deposed by Zimny’s attorney last spring.
“In her deposition she says she spent hours with Mr. Chow going over books with him,” he said. “She said sometimes he completely missed the point. He was struggling with some of the material and she helped him.”
Gorman said that the assistance Cassie provided Chow was entirely appropriate and in fact supported by HKS, where over a third of all current students are international.
“There are a lot of foreign students that have these tutors,” he said. “I know it’s very commonplace.”

While most people think of only financial disaster when hearing the names Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Harvard students heard the other side of the story at a speech at the Institute of Politics on Thursday night.
Former CEO of Freddie Mac Charles E. Haldeman outlined both the mistakes and the accomplishments of these government sponsored enterprises—called GSEs—during his lecture.
“I hope people have a better understanding of the contributions that Fannie and Freddie have made to the society and some of the unfortunate mistakes that were made,” Haldeman said after the speech.
Haldeman said that the subject of Freddie Mac often gets heated—wearing their workplace T-shirts to the grocery store, his employees have even been accosted—and it is uncommon to hear a fair perspective.
“If I succeed, it may be the first time that there has been a balanced presentation on the GSEs,” he said during his speech.Haldeman, who headed Freddie Mac from 2009 through 2012, addressed the widespread accusation that his company and Fannie Mae were behind the 2008 recession.
“I don’t think they were the cause of the financial crisis, but I do think that they did contribute to underwriting standards because that’s where the competition was going,” he said.
He discussed three options for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae’s future—a wholly government-run set-up, private companies, or a combination of the two. He said he favored private ownership, with the caveat that the government would still provide guarantees on securities for companies that paid insurance premiums.
But he expressed frustration that Congress had not acted to put any plan in place yet.
“I think the most important thing is to go somewhere soon,” he said. “During the election year, it is remarkable how little the candidates have discussed this, given how important of an issue it is,”
Applied math concentrator Sumit Malik ’13 said, “He gave a great overview while also supplying specific facts and was very focused on future policy.”
John S. Reidy ’61, a member of the advisory board for the Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy, said that Haldeman provided a valuable perspective. “I thought it was very revealing, but we were left with the same uncertainty of what is next.”

About 65 Harvard employees, students, and community members protested in front of the Holyoke Center early Thursday evening in support of Johany Pilar, a science center mailroom worker who says she was sexually harassed.
For about an hour, protesters listened to several speakers, chanted, and marched in circles. The rally was sponsored by student groups such as Black Harvard Women, Harvard College International Women’s Rights Collective, Harvard Socialists at GSAS, and Harvard Student Labor Action Movement.
“I think that the large number of students who showed up was a testament to the fact that people are angry enough,” Student Labor Action Movement member Kirin Gupta ’16 said. “The protest showed the outrage that Harvard has brought upon itself.”
Pilar, who was present at the protest but did not speak, publicly shared her story for the first time at a Rape Culture Panel hosted by the IWRC last week.
At the panel, Pilar said that a co-worker grabbed her face on two separate occasions last spring and said he wanted to kiss her. Pilar felt uncomfortable and immediately reported the incident to the management, who she said prevented her from attending therapy sessions and threatened her with disciplinary action or termination.
Flyers distributed at the event said that Pilar has filed a complaint with the Massachussetts Commission Against Discrimination.
University spokesperson Kevin Galvin declined to comment on the specific case but said in an emailed statement to the Crimson that the University takes such allegation seriously. The University, he wrote, maintains a “policy of non-retaliation to encourage employees to come forward with complaints so that allegations can be investigated.”
Pilar told The Crimson that the rally demonstrates to others who have been harassed the supportive community surrounding this issue.
“I don’t want to shut my mouth,” Pilar said.
Geoffrey P. Carens, a library assistant and Pilar’s representative in the Harvard Union of Clerical Technical Workers, led many of the protest’s chants and introduced its speakers. He said that the purpose of the event was to raise public awareness about Pilar’s situation and sexual harassment in general.
Protesters said that they want Harvard to respond directly to Pilar’s case and change their policies in handling workers’ grievances.
“We want Harvard to issue a formal apology to Johany and make sure that she never has to work with that man again,” Amanda Haziz-Ginsberg, a recent Divinity School graduate and member of Harvard Socialists at GSAS, said. “Enough is enough. We will not put up with this.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Dan Aykroyd of The Blues Brothers and Isaac Tigrett, co-founder of Hard Rock Cafe, were looking for a location to open a music venue in the early 1990s, Harvard Square was an obvious first choice.
“[Aykroyd] wanted to open it up in a place that celebrated all kinds of music,” said House of Blues Vice President of Marketing David Fortin, who worked at the Harvard Square location from 1994 to 2001. “He was very passionate about the community of Harvard Square, a place where all walks of life are coming together.”
After all, the Square had a good track record. A few decades earlier, Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Pete Seeger, and Joni Mitchell all got their start performing at Club Passim off of Church Street.
But after House of Blues left its 180-person space in the Square, opening spin-offs nationwide and eventually a 2,425-person capacity venue in Boston, it seemed the beat had moved on, leaving Harvard Square behind.
Today, the Square at last looks poised to re-invigorate its legacy of up-and-coming live music. Two new music venues opening within the year—the Sinclair, a 525-person-capacity concert hall and restaurant, and a yet-to-be-named American bistro with nightly live music—hope to bring spunk and soul back to historic Harvard Square.
TUNING UP
Set to open later this month, the Sinclair is backed by The Bowery Presents, a New York-based promotion company, and Boston chef Michael Schlow. The Bowery Presents has been operating out of Boston since 2010 and is already involved in the Cambridge music scene, promoting shows at The Middle East and TT the Bear’s Place, both in Central Square.
The Sinclair is still under construction at 52 Church St., a space built in 1982 that once housed Atrium Cafe and later Brew Moon. The first show in the new restaurant-concert hall is scheduled for Tuesday, Oct. 30.
“To find a space that ended up being the perfect layout for a venue and restaurant right in the heart of the Square was amazing,” wrote Josh Bhatti, head of The Bowery Presents: Boston.
The Sinclair already has 30 shows on its line-up until December, some of which have already sold out. Acts include Andrew Jackson Jihad, K’Naan, Converge, and David Wax Museum.
“We’ve worked really hard to curate an opening line-up that is diverse and caters to a lot of different musical interests,” Bhatti wrote in an email.
The other music venue will be a second location for Boston restaurant owner Jack Bardy, who currently operates The Beehive in Boston’s South End. Both of Bardy’s venues are full-service restaurants with live music every night, focused on jazz and blues.
“It’s a natural extension to Harvard Square. It has an incredible history with music and a captive audience,” Bardy said.
Bardy said he plans for the restaurant to open at 11a Brattle Street in the spring and is still thinking of a name. The intimate semi-underground restaurant will have a capacity of more than 100.
Bruce Ferrara, music director of The Beehive and of the new Harvard Square location, said he hopes to see the spot helping a vibrant music culture return to the area.
“It’s a place that people want to see what is going on,” Ferrara said. “It used to be exciting and interesting and inspiring. It really hasn’t been that way for 20 years.”
Trinity Property Management, a major Harvard Square property owner, leases both spaces of the new music venues.
“The idea of a live music venue is something that we think will really add to the character of Harvard Square,” said John P. DiGiovanni, president of Trinity Property Management.
DiGiovanni said that his company has spoken with officials at Harvard, but the University did not contribute to discussion about the new use of the spaces.
“We spoke with some folks over there just so they’re aware,” DiGiovanni said.
Yet Bhatti said he envisions eventual collaboration between the Sinclair and Harvard—perhaps hosting University events in the concert hall.
REACHING FOR THE HIGH NOTE
Alongside the new music offerings entering the neighborhood, existing venues in the Square are making improvements.
In the former home of the original House of Blues, Tommy Doyle’s, an Irish pub with a 165-person capacity, features bands several nights each week. Josh Caress, talent buyer, said that most of the bands who play at Tommy Doyle’s find out about the space because their friends’ bands played there or because it used to be the House of Blues.
But recently, the pub launched a website solely dedicated to the venue’s live music, hoping to attract more nationally recognized artists. Now, when looking for a small Boston-area venue to play, booking agents and artists will come across Tommy Doyle’s more easily.
An even older Harvard Square music standby, Club Passim, is also looking at revitalizing. Though the legendary folk music club has been at the same location at 47 Palmer St. since 1963, the operators discussed looking for a new address last May.
New firecodes had shrunk the venue’s capacity from 125 to 101 people. “We had to ask, can you survive with a 101-person venue, and is that the best model?” said Dan Hogan, executive director.
But the club’s long history felt compelling enough to convince its managers to keep it in Harvard Square.
Instead of moving, Club Passim will undergo renovations that may start as early as this summer, Hogan said. The space occupied by the Club is currently owned by Harvard, and Hogan hopes to partner with the University for the renovation.
Keeping the small setting, he said, provides the perfect intimate environment for appreciating great folk artists.
“You can hear a lot of great people up close and personal,” Hogan said.
HARVARD SQUARE HARMONIZING
While Boston often hosts national touring acts, Matt Smith, managing director at Club Passim, describes the current scene in Cambridge and Somerville as more indie.
“That river is a big divide,” Smith said.
Perhaps the most eclectic venue in the Square is the Democracy Center, a nonprofit organization that makes space available for activists and bands. Concerts there are alcohol-free and pay-as-you-can.
“If you can’t pay anything then you can still come in, but if you can give something, it’s appreciated. The Democracy Center exists to provide a space for nonprofits,” said Sarah Cadorette, the organization’s co-coordinator.
The Democracy Center, at 45 Mount Auburn St., has a 150-person capacity, with four rooms for shows. For the most part, its shows are punk and hard-core metal and rock. Many of the punk shows are hosted in a room with closed doors to facilitate moshing.
As the Harvard Square music scene grows, most proprietors say they are not worried about the increasingly crowded landscape. The main competition for Harvard Square’s music venues comes from Boston and from Central Square establishments like The Middle East, which hosts nightly entertainment in 200- and 550-person rooms.
Hogan in particular said that Club Passim has no reason to fear competition from its new neighbor, The Sinclair on Church Street, not only because concerts at Club Passim tend to start earlier in the evening than other shows but also because of the cooperative environment he sees among local music venues.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A prevention trial performed on male physicians revealed that taking a daily multivitamin modestly reduced the occurrence of cancer in men, according to a study by Harvard Medical School researchers published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
This study is the first long-term, randomized clinical trial to suggest the benefits of taking regular doses of multivitamins, according to HMS professor Howard D. Sesso, who is the study’s co-principal investigator.  Similar studies in the past have involved high doses of single vitamins or other combinations that aren’t available to consumers, added the lead author, HMS professor J. Michael Gaziano.
In the study, 14,641 male physicians over the age of 50 were given either multivitamins or placebos through the mail over the course of 11 years.
“We [tested only physicians] because they reported their health information well and it was easy for us to consent them, because they understood what we were trying to do…and the importance of sticking with it,” said Gaziano, who works in Brigham and Women’s Hospital’s Division of Aging.
According to Sesso, whenever a participant reported a change in their health—like the occurrence of cancer—their medical records were requested and examined by a committee of physicians that either confirmed or unconfirmed the initial self-report.
The group that took the multivitamins experienced 8 percent fewer cases of cancer compared to the placebo group, according to Gaziano.
“It was very well administered, and the controls were well randomized,” said David S. Chapin ’60, a participant in the study and an HMS professor. “The number of people and the length of time makes it so the results are believable.”
While the study only involved healthy males over the age of 50, Sesso believes the benefits might extend to other groups as well.
“We seem to think that the mechanism of effect of a multivitamin is blind to who’s taking it,” he said. “If it’s the combo of all the vitamins and minerals together that interact together to potentially reduce cancer risk, it might not matter whether you’re a man woman or otherwise.”
Sesso said that at least one third of all U.S. adults take multvitamins.
Because of this fact, Chapin said that any findings about multivitamins are significant.
“Vitamins are a multi-billion dollar industry in our country and people may be throwing away their money if there’s no benefit,” he said.
While he said he believes the reduction in cancer rates in the study is fairly small, Chapin said that he will continue to take vitamins.
“I’m not running out to buy them today, but the next time I’m in Costco, I’ll probably buy some vitamins,” said Chapin.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Prospective entrepreneurs gathered at the Harvard Innovation Lab Wednesday evening to kick off the second annual President’s Challenge, a competition meant to foster a culture of socially-minded innovation on campus.
This year’s Presidential Challenge will focus on five “issue areas”: learning, energy and the environment, health, disaster preparation and relief, and the arts. The winning team and up to three runners-up will share a prize of $100,000 to make their project proposals come true.
The President’s Challenge was created last academic year as “an investment in a new form of education,” David A. Edwards, a professor of biomedical engineering and the keynote speaker at the kickoff event, said in an interview.
“It is incomplete to frame a Harvard education around a definition of our understanding in opinions that is anything other than contemporary,” he said.
Edwards said that the President’s Challenge is an attempt on the University’s part to ready students for the fast-paced, ever-changing technology sector.
“The rapidity of change is so great.”
Edwards said.
The President’s Challenge, he said,  is meant to “help [students] learn in a way that is fundamentally relevant to how we learn today.”
Last year the Challenge’s five issue categories were clean air, clean water, education, global health, and personal health. This year’s focus is intended to make the Challenge more pertinent to undergraduate students.
“This is both an educational and socially-focused initiative,” I-Lab Director Gordon S. Jones said at the event.
Edwards said he hopes this year’s Challenge will exhibit “a diversification of the kinds of students that are pursuing the Challenge; not just grads but undergrads.”
“Students should view this as an incredible learning opportunity,” he said.
Proposals for social entrepreneurship projects in any of these five areas must be submitted by Feb. 3rd.
Last year’s winner Vaxess Technologies uses silk proteins to develop vaccines that do not need to be refrigerated. Their project will increase access to vaccines around the world while simultaneously supporting rural silkworm farmers in Cambodia.
The group of graduate and undergraduate students gathered at the I-Lab hopes to follow in Vaxess’s footsteps.
Zachary L. Wong ’16 called the event “very inspiring.” He said in the future he hopes to approach social entrepreneurship thorough social media and web design.
Edwards ended his speech telling students that this event is just a starting point.
“The way you all are going to make the world a better place is by not stopping here,” he said. “You need to exploit this incredible moment.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Oct. 19
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the winner of the President’s Challenge will receive $70,000 and three runners-up will each receive $10,000. In fact, one winner and up to three runners-up will share a $100,000 prize, but the division of the money has not yet been determined.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Today’s youth don’t talk. They text.
So when they want to report bullying, they might not turn to a traditional hotline with an operator on the other end of the phone. They need a place to text their written cries for help.
That was the argument that the leaders of youth activism organization ‘Do Something’ presented  at the Harvard Graduate School of Education yesterday, where they explained how a text message hotline and other social media-based programs for teenagers could combat bullying.
“Text messaging is how young people communicate with each other. Social change needs to be built that way also,” said Nancy Lublin, the CEO of the nonprofit organization, which encourages teenagers to volunteer for social causes.
The group runs many campaigns, from helping teens photograph shelter animals to up their chances of adoption, to asking them to provide their friends’ phone numbers so that they will get texts reminding them to register to vote, to running bone marrow testing drives. When it comes to the issue of bullying, both in person and via the internet, Lublin said, they go to teens themselves to find out how they can help.
“The youth knows about what’s going on in the bullying world more than adults,” Lublin said.
Lublin and fellow speaker Jeff Bladt, data scientist at Do Something, emphasized the usefulness of data collected from social networking sites and text messaging for garnering information about ongoing bullying.
“Most of the social work is done after the fact, but if you see the data out there, you can see patterns and you might be able to do preventative work,” Bladt said.
To try to stop bullying before crises occur, Do Something recently created a Facebook app that asks high school students to fill out an eight-question survey evaluating the prevalence of bullying in their schools.
Lublin complained, however, that even though Facebook can be a tool for tracking problems, it is also a common forum for bullying itself.
For example, even though homophobic comments on Facebook are public, social norms deter students from speaking up against this form of abuse, Lublin said. “The kind of bullying you see on Facebook is culturally acceptable,” she said.
Kerry Salvo, who attended the talk, said that as the senior projects manager at City Year, she also works to use social media to confront challenges in the education sector. “As an organization, we’ve gotten really good with social media,” she said about City Year, which puts volunteers to work in struggling schools. “We have a big Twitter campaign going on right now. I think it’s really interesting to share with the people the power of social media,” Salvo said.
The Do Something leaders agreed that social networking can eventually help charities accomplish their missions, even if their goals may not be immediately realized.
“Here’s our product: teenagers. Our enemy is apathy, and so we look at optimizing opportunities for teens to take action,” Lublin said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This is Part III in a series on the presidential election's impact on the issues that Harvard lobbies on. Read Part I on student financial aid and Part II on research funding.
As the presidential race enters the final, crucial weeks before Election Day, Mitt Romney and Barack Obama have sparred over immigration reform—an issue that Harvard has spent thousands championing in Washington.
For Harvard, the issue of undocumented immigration hit close to home in 2010 when Eric Balderas ’13 was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in San Antonio.
Classmates formed a Facebook group rallying behind Balderas, who illegally immigrated from Mexico to the United States when he was four.
“Eric is a model stellar student and citizen at Harvard University,” the page, titled “Keep Eric Home,” stated. “His deportation will deprive all of us of a potential citizen whose courage, commitment, and sincere desire to help others through science can only make our country a better place.”
Upper-level administrators and leaders on Capitol Hill also spoke out in support of Balderas, who was ultimately permitted to remain in the country.
Though the Balderas incident is now years in the past, immigration reform remains an important issue for many on campus. Harvard has historically accepted more undocumented students than other leading universities—approximately five to eight every year—according to Nicolas E. Jofre ’13, a student activist and former president of Harvard’s Act on a Dream, an undergraduate group that advocates for immigration reform.
Who wins on November 6 could affect not only the fate of thousands of immigrants across the country, but also the status of undocumented students currently studying at Harvard.
Both Obama and Romney have advocated for immigration reform. Both, however, offer significantly different philosophies and visions for the next four years.
A DREAM, AND DEPORTATIONS, DEFERRED
Since his campaign days in 2008, Obama has endorsed immigration reform that would create a road to citizenship for certain undocumented individuals.
“We need immigration reform that will secure our borders, and punish employers who exploit immigrant labor; reform that finally brings the 12 million people who are here illegally out of the shadows by requiring them to take steps to become legal citizens,” Obama said.
In the early years of his tenure, Obama strongly supported the DREAM Act—the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act, formally, which offered a six-year-long path toward U.S. citizenship for some immigrants.
The act found sympathy at higher education institutions across the nation. University President Drew G. Faust, along with several other university presidents, vigorously lobbied Capitol Hill for the passage of the DREAM Act, writing letters and making public statements in favor of the legislation.  Students, including Balderas, also voiced their support, some taking part in a rally at St. Paul’s Cathedral in Boston.
Despite these efforts, the DREAM Act was killed in the Senate in late 2010. Had it been passed into law, the legislation would have granted citizenship to about 40 undocumented students currently studying at Harvard, according to Anahi D. Mendoza Pacheco ’15, current co-chair of Act on a Dream.
The Obama administration, however, did take a step toward realizing its vision for immigration reform with an executive order last June that defers deportation and grants two-year work permits to undocumented students, veterans, and
young people brought to the United States at an early age.
“It’s not a permanent fix. This is a temporary, stopgap measure that lets us focus our resources wisely while giving a degree of relief and hope to talented, riven, patriotic young people,” Obama said. The policy has alleviated fears of deportation for undocumented students at Harvard, Mendoza said. Thousands of young undocumented immigrants from around the country have already submitted applications. However, Jacqueline Bhabha, Law School lecturer and University advisor on Human Rights Education, said she believes that Obama’s deferred action plan may have been less than sincere, a pandering ploy aimed at Hispanic voters who now compose a growing portion of the electorate.
Throughout his term in office, Obama has supported policy which make distinctions between undocumented immigrants with and without a criminal record. Obama backed DREAM Act legislation and ordered ICE not to deport some immigrants—both measures applicable to undocumented individuals without criminal records.
Obama has also asked enforcement officials to target undocumented workers convicted of crimes instead of conducting indiscriminate raids that separate families and punish children brought to the U.S. through no fault of their own.
Despite advocates’ high hopes for immigration reform when Obama first took office, the president has failed to enact substantial reforms, Bhabha said.
“The first four years of Obama’s term have been extremely disappointing,” she said, noting that deportations of undocumented immigrants have increased in number during the Obama administration.
THE ROMNEY PLAN
The policy shifts of the last four year may be reversed if Romney, who takes a harder stance on illegal immigration, wins the race for the Oval Office.
Though Romney does not believe most undocumented immigrants should become citizens, he has endorsed, at times, granting permanent residence to some.
“There are four million people who are waiting in line to get here legally,” he said during the second presidential debate. Individuals who illegaly immigrated as children “should have a pathway to become a permanent resident of the United States and military service, for instance, is one way they would have that kind of pathway to become a permanent resident,” Romney added.
At that same debate, Romney also said that he would instate an employment verification or “E-Verify” system, which would deny immigrants driver’s licenses and would oppose amnesty for immigrants already living in the United States.
Though Romney has not laid out a concrete plan, Romney said he wants to pursue comprehensive immigration reform at a campaign stop in Florida last summer.
Romney’s comments on illegal immigration did raise some eyebrows during a Republican primary debate in January 2012. On that night, Romney angered some Latino voters with his comments on self-deportation, calling it the best way to cope with the millions living illegally in the United States.
“The answer is self-deportation, which is people decide they can do better by going home because they can’t find work here because they don’t have legal documentation to allow them to work here,” Romney said. “We’re not going to round them up.”
Romney has also said that, if elected, he would veto any legislation modeled after the DREAM Act, standing behind Senate Republicans who succeeded in blocking the passage of the legislation two years ago. He has promised to honor any applications for deferred action made between June and November, when Romney says he will discontinue the program if elected.
“The people who have received the special visa that the president has put in place... should expect that the visa would continue to be valid,” Romney said told The Hill in early October.
The stagnant economic climate, however, has discouraged politicians from putting their political muscle behind pushing immigration reform. The presidential candidates themselves have focused on the lackluster economy and tepid job growth while on the campaign trail.
With a weak economy weighing on the minds of Americans, the future of immigration reform is, therefore, “very difficult to predict,” Bhabha said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two leaders of the Chilean Students Movement proposed economic, political, and social reforms to rectify pervasive inequity in the Chilean education system in a talk at the Harvard Graduate School of Education on Thursday afternoon.
“[The Movement sees] that it’s not right, and they want to change it,” said Maria Paz, a member of the GSE’s Latin America Education Forum.
Camila Vallejo and Noam Titelman, presidents of their respective university’s federations of the Movement, joined the GSE’s Felipe Barrera-Osorio, Assistant Professor of Education and Economics, to discuss educational reforms the Movement has demanded.
On this same trip to the U.S., Vallejo and Titelman accepted the Letelier-Moffitt Human Rights Award on behalf of the Movement, a prize bestowed by the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, D.C.  The group is the youngest to ever receive this honor.
Titelman said one goal of the Movement is for quality education to be seen as a social, universal right accessible to all.  With this in mind, the Movement aims to expose the poor design of the Chilean education system, put into place during the nation’s prior military dictatorship, and change the capitalistic structure of Chilean higher education.
Paz said that for seven months last year, the Movement engaged in street protests to express outrage against the Chilean educational system.
The event’s moderator, GSE student Ana C. Hidalgo, said that Chile has the world’s most expensive education system.  The average tuition at a Chilean university is approximately $3,400, while the average salary is only around $8,000.
According to Titelman, the Movement laments that the government does not sufficiently fund the public university system. He said that government policies force the poor into private universities where tuition can be unreasonable.  In addition, a single test, designed so that the richest students will perform the best, is the only factor in Chilean college admissions.
“We have the most segregated system in the world,” he said.
Titelman labeled these for-profit universities “fast food universities” because, like burgers, they are advertised to seem appealing, but are of lower quality than publicized.
Through the event’s translator, Vallejo said that the government needed to impose taxes on the large, wealthy transnational companies operating in Chile and “stop bowing down” to the private sector.
“School isn’t just for acquiring knowledge, but for sitting next to someone radically different from yourself,” Titelman added.
Dominican GSE student Maria E. Baez, who attended the talk, was in Chile during last winter’s protests.
“Even as a foreigner, it felt that Chile was very divided on a socioeconomic level,” she said.
Amelia R. Knudson ’13 studied in Chile last winter in the midst of the protests, and conducted research for her Social Studies thesis on the protests. Knudson attended a number of Movement protests, both authorized and unauthorized.
“It’s really kind of a fun atmosphere,” said Knudson of the marches which included chants, costumes, and dancing.
But it wasn’t all fun and games, she added.
“People bought and brought lemons and salt to protect against the tear gas,” said Knudson.

Harvard University filed an official draft of its Institutional Master Plan for Allston development on Thursday.
The plan outlines nine major proposals for Harvard’s properties across the Charles River, all of which the University expects to complete within 10 years. These proposals include a renovation of Harvard Stadium and the construction of a new basketball stadium, remodeling and construction of several Harvard Business School buildings, and the construction of a hotel and conference center near the current Charlesview site.
In addition, it designates a parcel of land in North Allston as a “mixed-use” parcel to be used for future University and community development.
 
Harvard Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp said that the development will benefit both the University and Allston residents. “[The development] will provide critical physical improvements serving key academic needs while establishing Barry’s Corner as a nexus of University and community interaction that will be transformative for Harvard and the Allston community,” she said in the Harvard Gazette.

University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 said that the Allston development will serve as a creative space for science. “Allston presents the University with the opportunity to develop a unique innovation hub. It will be focused on both teaching and research in translational life science and engineering,” he said in the Gazette.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When senior Courtney Diekema came to Harvard in the fall of 2009, she was focused on three things: classes, a military career, and soccer. Diekema—now one of Radcliffe’s top heavyweight rowers—never thought she would call the Charles River home.
But as a rookie goalie on the women’s soccer team, Diekema suffered from bilateral tibial sesamoiditis, a foot injury, which made running and jumping difficult.
“I was in a walking boot a lot,” Diekema recalls. “I would play for a month and be in a boot for a month. Over the summer, my doctors told me that soccer wasn’t sustainable and that I should think about stopping.”
But for Diekema, quitting soccer felt like giving up.
“[The decision] was pretty challenging,” she admits. “I had given up swimming [in high school] to pursue soccer, and giving up soccer just seemed like just another sport that I didn’t pursue all the way.”
Although the decision did not come easily, Diekema ultimately chose to walk away from the sport.
For Radcliffe heavyweight coach Liz O’Leary, Diekema’s tough choice was a stroke of good fortune for her team.
The summer before Diekema’s sophomore year, she decided to give rowing a shot.
“My mother had always wanted me to row because she heard it was good if you were tall.... In high school she tried to send me to rowing camp, but I only wanted to play soccer,” Diekema says. “Over the summer I still really wanted to do a sport, so I emailed the coaches and told them I am a 6’1” recruited soccer player and that I was interested in joining the crew team.”
Harvard soccer coach Ray Leone also reached out to O’Leary.
“Ray Leone came up to me one day and said he had a great soccer player who couldn’t play soccer anymore,” O’Leary recalls. “He knew [she was] a great candidate for Harvard when he recruited her, and we were the beneficiaries of it.”
Teaching someone how to row is not easy, but O’Leary says that, Diekema’s athleticism and willingness to work smoothed the transition.
“It wasn’t something that came to her naturally, but she worked so hard,” O’Leary says. “Miles make champions in our sport, and she has been putting in a lot of miles.”
And indeed, a champion Diekema became. In just her second season of rowing she helped lead the first varsity eight to an upset Ivy League Championship last spring, and she was named an All-American in recognition of her efforts.
“If you had asked me at the beginning of the season if I ever thought I would be an All-American, even All-Ivy, I would have said, ‘No way,’” Diekema says.
Though she is fairly new to the sport, there is no end in sight for this rower’s burgeoning career. Diekema has been pursued by the US national program and is considering the Air Force’s World Class Athlete Program, which would allow her to begin working for the military while training for the 2016 Olympics.
Being one of the fastest people on the Radcliffe team makes Diekema a natural role model, and O’Leary says her presence on the team is strong but quiet.
“[Diekema] is a leader through and through,” O’Leary says. “She works hard all the time and sets the standard. She knows how to draw out the skills of others just by being encouraging and positive, but she doesn’t have to say a lot.”
Off the water, Diekema also leads by example. As Wing Commander for the Air Force ROTC at MIT (which she has been involved in since freshman year), she worked over the summer to create and organize the training plan for the cadets this semester, and she currently acts as a direct liaison between the officers and the other cadets.
A government concentrator with a job lined up in Air Force Intelligence upon graduation, Diekema considered attending both Air Force and Navy.
“I applied to military academies and Harvard,” Diekema says. “I chose Harvard because I can be a normal college student, and for a designated amount of time each week, I get to be in uniform and have the military aspect. It’s the best of both worlds.”
Having the best of both worlds does not always leave a lot of time for relaxation. This semester is the biggest balancing act of Diekema’s college career, as she devotes about 30 hours to crew—including individual workouts—and between 10 and 16 hours to ROTC. And then there is school.
So what does a varsity athlete and soon-to-be Air Force Officer do in her spare time?
“Great question,” she laughs. “Sleep is the number one priority.  Any time there is downtime, it’s nap time.”
Diekema has maintained a lot of the social ties she formed with the soccer team, which she says made leaving the team easier.  Her blocking group includes three current and former members of the women’s soccer team, and her roommates remember her as a fierce competitor and supportive teammate, even as a freshman.
“She is super competitive,” says blockmate AJ Millet, a goalkeeper on the soccer team who played with Diekema freshman year. “We were both goalkeepers competing for the same spot. I was worried there might be tension, but she was really funny, and we just clicked right away.”
Diekema describes herself as “very chill,” but even during the offseason, she can’t keep still. She does triathlons to cross train and loves the outdoors.
Her blockmates have gotten to know a different side of her in the rare moments when she has time to hang out.
“She is honestly a little bit of a geek outside of sports,” Millet says. “She loves ‘Harry Potter’ and ‘Lord of the Rings,’ and we watch a lot of stupid movies. She’s just kind of goofy and fun.”
But as soon as she gets on the water, her focus returns. This attitude, as well as her athleticism, have helped her learn a new sport from scratch and rocket to the national level in just three years.
“Courtney and her senior teammates are a class with tremendous character and personality,” O’Leary says. “I’m excited for them and proud of what they’re doing, and Courtney is very much the heart and soul of that.”
As much as Diekema has given to the Radcliffe team, she said she has gotten back even more. Being a Radcliffe rower has shaped her college career in ways that she never expected, and she emphasizes the team rather than her individual accomplishments.
“I just want to say that I love my team,” she says. “It’s the best mix of girls you could ever meet. I’ve been so lucky to have them as a resource and support system.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“It’s not quite as easy as it looks,” Christine Hughes laughs, reflecting on the past three years in which she has watched the Head of the Charles Regatta from the shore. “They’re actually working pretty hard in there.”
This year, the senior walk-on is ready to make her Head of the Charles debut as a member of the Radcliffe lightweight second varsity eight. She adds to an experienced collection of seniors who hope to help the Black and White lightweights make history this year.
The Harvard women’s swimming team recruited Hughes after the Clemson, S.C., native swam the 100-meter breaststroke at the 2008 U.S. Olympic Trials while in high school. But through two seasons of varsity swimming, Hughes struggled to drop time.
By her junior year, she was ready to find another sport, and she climbed into a shell for the first time. After exploring the possibility of rowing for the Radcliffe heavyweights in the fall of 2011, Hughes became a permanent member of the lightweight team in the spring.
Hughes’ individual strength translated smoothly into success on the water for the Black and White. She surprised crewmates and coaches when she posted the team’s fastest time in her first six-kilometer erg test last season.
“Being so new to the sport, I didn’t have any expectations,” Hughes says of her first months on the team. “There were no limits.”
Also in his second year, Radcliffe lightweight coach Michiel Bartman looks forward to seeing what Hughes is capable of this season.
“I know she’s very eager to learn,” Bartman says, noting Hughes’ focus on perfecting her rowing technique. “It shows me that she definitely wants to make the 1V this year, and we’ll see how well that goes.”
While this weekend will be a first for Hughes, Black and White seniors Emma Lukasiewicz and Elizabeth Hamilton bring a combined eight years of Head of the Charles experience to the table. The Mather roommates sit in the fifth and sixth “power” seats of the first varsity boat, and their veteran leadership may be key as Radcliffe looks to deliver its first-ever Head of the Charles win in the lightweight eights.
“They want to get everything out of their senior year,” Bartman says of Lukasiewicz and Hamilton. “They’ve made a commitment to step up the training for themselves, and hopefully that encourages the other girls.”
As a high school rower, Lukasiewicz found early success, winning four consecutive lightweight eight Canadian secondary school national championships for Toronto’s Havergal College.  She is also the only Radcliffe Class of 2013 lightweight to be expected to row four years on the first varsity eight. She served as co-captain last year as a junior.
“[Lukasiewicz] is a talented rower,” Bartman says. “I don’t know what time frame, but if she really wants to make that effort, it wouldn’t surprise me if I saw her name appearing on the [Canadian] National Team roster.”
Hamilton, meanwhile, grew up in the shadow of the Charles in Newton, Mass., and comes from a rowing family. In high school, she competed twice in the Head of the Charles in the youth division for Brighton’s Community Rowing, Inc., alongside her twin sister, Stephanie, who will coxswain Colgate’s club fours entry this weekend. As a rower, Stephanie battled a tendon injury during her junior year, of high school and Hamilton learned to row on the opposite side of the boat in an attempt to lessen the asymmetrical strain on her sister’s arms.
“That was a pretty cool thing for us,” Hamilton said. “If she was having a lot of pain in her arm, we could always just flip seats so I could relieve her.”
After graduation, Hamilton may follow in her father’s footsteps by racing on the British collegiate circuit, which has no four-year eligibility limitations. Lukasiewicz is also considering extending her career overseas. Neither thinks that this weekend will be their last Head of the Charles race.
“I really love this sport.... I don’t really picture myself ever giving it up,” Lukasiewicz said. “[Hamilton] and I have talked about trying to row together in the future, which would be really fun.”
The Black and White also find senior leadership in co-captains Erika McCormick and Veronique Irwin, who rowed with Lukasiewicz on the first varsity eight during their freshman fall. Battling injuries, the two have recently seen reduced roles on the water but have found other ways to inspire crewmates. Despite suffering a season-ending concussion that prevented her from training with the team last spring, McCormick was a constant presence at the Weld Boathouse throughout the season, helping Bartman with practices and regattas.
“I think that type of commitment is what the girls want to see,” Bartman says of McCormick.
Meanwhile, injuries have prevented Irwin from competing in the last two editions of the Head of the Charles. But this fall, she will be back on the water.
“It means a lot to me to be able to race this year,” Irwin says. “I’ll probably be a little emotional when the race is over.”
Irwin and McCormick will row for the Black and White’s second varsity eight this Sunday.
Radcliffe seeks to improve on the bronze medals it earned at the 2011 Head of the Charles and at the Intercollegiate Rowing Association National Championships in June. The six-kilometer race on Sunday with defending national champion Stanford and defending Head of the Charles champion Wisconsin will not only provide an early benchmark for the crew’s end-season goals but will also present an important challenge in itself. Of the six eights races open to collegiate boats at the Head of the Charles, the women’s lightweight eights is the only one that a Radcliffe crew has never won.
“Especially for the seniors, it’s an important race…. It’s kind of weird that it could be their last Head of the Charles,” Bartman says. “If you had to grade it, it’s almost as important as winning the Eastern Sprints or the IRAs.”
“We’re in a really good place this year; I think we’re in a better place than we’ve ever been before,” Hamilton adds. “It’s going to be a good weekend to show some speed and see what we can do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What a difference a year makes.
This time last season, the Princeton football team was 1-4 and on its way to a second-straight 1-9 finish. Over the course of the year, the Tigers gave up the second-most points in the Ivy League and scored the fewest.
But that Princeton team shares little in common with the Tigers squad that has come to play in the first five games of 2012. Princeton brings its first three-game winning streak since 2006 (the last year they won an Ivy crown) and an unblemished conference record into Saturday’s home contest against Harvard.
“This is what I expected, absolutely positively,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “We expected them to bust out, it was just a matter of time.”
Predicted to finish last in the preseason Ivy League poll, the Tigers started the season with a three-point loss to Lehigh, which is currently ranked seventh in the FCS. In Week Two, Princeton lost to Georgetown on a field goal with 14 seconds to play after the Hoyas got into field goal range thanks to a third-down roughing-the-passer penalty on the Tigers and a fourth down conversion.
But then things changed radically.
Princeton finally ended its losing streak the following week with a 33-6 romping of Columbia. That win started a three-game winning streak that is more indicative of the talent the Tigers put on the field, according to a coach who knows a thing or two about winning streaks.
“It’s just mind-boggling that they could go 2-18 with the incredible talent they’ve had on that team,” Murphy said. “In my 18 years here, they’ve had more talent than anybody, including Harvard, so this is what I expected.”
Much of Princeton’s success can be attributed to a dominant defense that gave up just 20 points during its three-game winning streak, including a shutout of Brown last week.
“They are huge and athletic, and they now are in sync,” Murphy said. “They understand what they are supposed to do in that defense; it’s just all come together, and now they believe.”
Princeton’s D is led by a pair of defensive ends in their 3-4 scheme that wreak havoc on opposing offensive lines.
“You start with the two bookends,” Murphy said, “300-pound NFL prospect Caraun Reid, easily the best defensive lineman in our league, [and Mike] Catapano—probably the second best defensive linemen in the league on the other end.”
Those two are third and first in the conference in sacks, respectively, but they are far from the only gifted defensive players on the Tigers’ roster.
“You don’t even talk about the 290-pound nose guard,” Murphy said. “They don’t talk about the 6’4”, 260-pound [strongside] linebacker, the 6’2”, 240-pound [weakside] linebacker. They are just huge and athletic.”
Senior quarterback Colton Chapple will need to maintain his recent level of play, but his coach said he will also need a consistent running game to help him a week after senior running back Treavor Scales gained just 2.7 yards per rush against Bucknell.
“The bottom line is you have to stay balanced,” Murphy said. “If you come out and throw the ball 75 times, then eventually they will get to their quarterback, so you have to somehow keep them off balance.”
Scales said he’s ready to take on the Tigers’ defensive line after battling one as good in practice.
“They have some studs out there,” Scales said. “But I know for a fact that we have some studs too, so I practice against guys of their caliber every single day of my life.”
Those Harvard studs are part of a defense that ranks second in the league in total defense and points allowed, behind Princeton in both categories. But the Crimson defense is expected to have the upper hand Saturday as the Tigers are seventh in the league in total offense, while Harvard is first.
“The last two years they weren’t statistically a great offense,” Murphy said. “But we not only haven’t stopped them, we haven’t slowed them down the last two years, so that’s a big challenge to our defense. “
Princeton put up 39 points in last year’s loss and 28 the year before, both of which were highs for them against Ivy opponents.
Given the success the Tigers’ offense has had against the Crimson in recent years combined with how well their defense has performed this year, Saturday’s matchup could pose the biggest challenge yet for a defending-champion Harvard squad that has rolled to five straight wins by an average margin of victory of nearly 28 points thus far this year.
“I don’t know if any of us could have looked at the Princeton game based upon their record…as going to be a or the pivotal game, but clearly it is,” Murphy said.
Beyond being the most talented Ivy squad according to Murphy, the Tigers will be one of the most motivated as well this weekend thanks to their undefeated conference record and a senior class that has not beaten their Cambridge-based nemeses.
“Their level of motivation could probably not be any higher,” Murphy said. “As our players put it, they will be geeked up to play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We have hit the midway point of the 2012 Ivy football season, so let’s break down each team’s first five games by comparing them to other classic “middles.”
Harvard (5-0, 2-0 Ivy) is the “The Godfather: Part II.” Still debatable whether the middle edition of the trilogy is as good as the previous version, but it’s an all-time great nonetheless.
Princeton (3-2, 2-0) is Jimmy Eat World’s song “The Middle.” The Tigers are the surprise of the Ancient Eight and might be the conference’s second-strongest team after being picked to finish last in the Ivy preseason poll. They are a true testament to the song’s lyrics: “Hey, don’t write yourself off yet. It’s only in your head you feel left out or looked down on. Just try your best, try everything you can. And don’t you worry what they tell themselves when you’re away.” Princeton clearly took this message to heart this year when everyone wrote it off.
Penn (2-3, 2-0) is midterms—just a big letdown. The Quakers were expected to compete for the Ivy title, but have barely been able to beat Dartmouth and Columbia thus far.
Cornell (3-2, 1-1) is “Malcolm in the Middle”—a solid competitor led by an upstart star who has the chance to make it big. Let’s just hope for Jeff Mathews’ sake that upon graduating he doesn’t become an open wheel racer and a drummer for a no-name band. (Seriously, that’s what happened to Frankie Muniz! Go read his Wikipedia page. I’m as shocked as you are).
Dartmouth (3-2, 1-1) is the middle name—the one nobody cares about.
Brown (3-2, 0-2) is the middle class—which, if I understood Tuesday’s debate correctly, is really struggling right now. The Bears were shutout by the Tigers last Saturday with Governor Chris Christie in attendance. Christie was cheering for Princeton, where his son goes. I’m therefore looking forward to the Cory Booker 2013 attack ad that depicts Christie rooting against the middle class.
Columbia (1-4, 0-2) is Jose Molina—the middle of the Molina brothers and the one who is terrible at sports.
Yale (1-4, 0-2) is the middle of a bagel—there’s nothing there. Just don’t ask the bagel for a resume, because that resume will claim it’s a donut.
On to the Week Six picks.
PENN AT YALE
Yale football is as bad as it’s been in a long time. The Bulldogs are last in the conference in scoring defense while Geno Smith antithesis Eric Williams has already thrown 12 (TWELVE!) interceptions through five games. No Ivy quarterback who wasn’t also a failed Rhodes Scholar candidate threw that many all of last season. Unfortunately for Yale, more experienced backup John Whitelaw quit the team after losing the starting job to Williams, which is sort of like if Gerald Ford had quit Congress right before Watergate.
The Quakers, as discussed above, have been a disappointment, but the Bulldogs are so bad that they would even be steamrolled by the Little Engine That Could.
Pick: Penn 31, Yale 17
CORNELL AT BROWN 
Big Red star quarterback Jeff Mathews didn’t play last week due to injury, and unfortunately there’s no “Cornell Football Blog” to update you on his status while simultaneously making sure you don’t forget that the Big Red finished No. 17 in the country THREE YEARS AGO.
But even if Mathews doesn’t play, Cornell is the better team. Wideout Luke Tasker is a flat-out beast, with 16 more receptions and 342 more receiving yards than anyone in the league. The senior caught 11 passes for 280 yards against Monmouth last weekend, but he’ll face a much tougher task on Saturday against Bears’ All-American cornerback A.J. Cruz, who is probably the best defensive back in the Ancient Eight.
The Big Red desperately needs a win to stay alive in the Ivy title hunt, and backup QB Chris Amrhein showed he could run the show by throwing for 523 yards against the Hawks. I don’t think the Brown offense—shut out last week—can win a shootout, which nearly every Cornell game ends up being, so I’ll take the Big Red.
Pick: Cornell 35, Brown 31
DARTMOUTH AT COLUMBIA
The Lions almost pulled out a big upset at Franklin Field last week. Columbia was up, 20-10, on Penn midway through the fourth quarter before pulling a Chinua Achebe and watching things fall apart for its fourth straight loss.
The Dartmouth football program, meanwhile, continues to grow ever so slowly, which basically makes it the Ancient Eight’s toenail. Halfback Dominick Pierre has looked good replacing graduated star Nick Schweiger, leading the league in yards per carry. Pierre and Dartmouth’s defense, third best in the Ivies, will be enough for a win.
Pick: Dartmouth 24, Columbia 14
HARVARD AT PRINCETON
This could be an early Ivy title game. The Crimson has been absolutely dominant thus far, scoring more points (205) through five games than any Harvard team since Benjamin Harrison was president and its opponents included Exeter, Williams, and the Boston Athletic Association. Quarterback Colton Chapple is a strong frontrunner for Ivy Player of the Year, especially with scientists recently discovering that Tuesday’s earthquake was merely an aftershock of Chapple’s 58-yard touchdown rumble against Bucknell.
But Chapple and the Crimson offense will face its toughest test of the season in Princeton, which has allowed a league-low 11.6 points per game and is coming off a shutout against a Brown squad that scored 31 against Harvard. Senior Mike Catapano has been a terror defensively, registering a league-high seven sacks, and he will pose a major challenge for a beat-up Crimson offensive line.
On the whole, Princeton’s ascension from the bottom of the preseason polls to league contender has been impressive, especially after reigning Ivy Rookie of the Year Chuck Dibilio suffered a stroke in January and was lost for the season. But Harvard is putting together as dominant a year as the Ivy League has been seen in a long time, and on Saturday it will show why it is not only the best team in the Ancient Eight but one of the tops in the entire subdivision.
Lastly, if someone could help me get Jimmy Eat World out of my head, that would be much appreciated.
Pick: Harvard 31, Princeton 17

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If the Harvard field hockey team (3-9, 1-3 Ivy) is to break its current losing skid this weekend, it will take an Olympian effort. On Saturday at Bedford Field, the Crimson is set to square off against a No. 2 Princeton team that boasts four members from the U.S. national squad.
A matchup with the No. 2 Tigers (11-1, 4-0 Ivy) comes at an inopportune time for Harvard, which has dropped its last four contests, capped by a 4-0 home defeat to Cornell on Oct. 13. The Tigers, conversely, are riding a four-game winning streak and have been demolishing Ivy League competition this season, winning their first four conference games by a combined score of 26-1. The Crimson has scored only 14 goals in 12 total games this year.
Harvard will likely have to step up that goal total if it hopes to compete on Saturday; Princeton’s Kathleen Sharkey is the nation’s leading scorer (4.0 points per game), and she is arguably the fourth-most decorated athlete on her team. Sisters Katie and Julia Reinprecht both competed this past summer in the Olympic Games in London, and teammate Michelle Cesan was named as an Olympic alternate.
Tigers’ goalkeeper Christina Maida presents another obstacle. Generally, the Crimson can count on its own goalkeeper, co-captain Cynthia Tassopoulos, to outperform her counterpart on the other side of the field, but Maida has been one of the best in the country at her position this year. Maida is ninth in the country in goals against average, allowing only 1.30 goals per game.
But this statistic might say more about the stalwart defense in front of her, as her 0.705 save percentage puts her in a tie for 50th in the nation; Tassopoulos is 23rd with a 0.753 save percentage, and she has made over twice as many saves as Maida on the season.
“[To score], it’s going to take us building the ball all the way up from our...defense to our midfield and getting sharp passes, stick to stick,” Tassopoulos said. “Once we get into their cage, we’re going to have to look for shots that are on cage as hard as they can be and getting in there for tips.”
This isn’t the first time Harvard has come up against an elite opponent this season; the Crimson has already taken the field against No. 10 Northeastern and No. 16 Boston College. Though Harvard lost each match by three goals, sophomore forward Noel Painter said that the team’s effort in defeat against the Eagles gives it confidence heading into Saturday.
“We did lose [against Boston College], but we played the best that we had [all season] because the team was so good, and we had to rise to their level,” sophomore Noel Painter said. “Our whole team rises to the occasion; all the lines start clicking, and all our passes go smoother.”
Despite the daunting matchup on paper, Painter believes the challenge will galvanize her team, not cause it to shrink under the pressure. In fact, to some degree the Crimson’s disappointing record could play to its advantage in this game, belying the threat it presents to Princeton’s undefeated Ivy season.
“Honestly, we’re not going to win Ivies because of our record, but playing like we have nothing to lose is going to be very dangerous for Princeton,” Painter said. “I think they’re going to come in underestimating us, and that’s when we can knock them down.”
Painter also said she wouldn’t be star-struck taking the field across from athletes who have already reached the highest levels of her sport.
“I personally hope that one of [the national team players] marks me,” Painter said. “They’ve been to Beijing, they’ve trained all over the world, and they have so much experience playing against players at that level that it’s just going to make us play so much better.”
All year Harvard coach Tjerk van Herwaarden has maintained that the Crimson has the talent to play with any team in the country, and for a team whose postseason ambitions have largely faded away, a win over the highly-ranked Tigers could serve as a substitute for an Ivy trophy or an NCAA Tournament berth.
“In general, this game is a way for us to show ourselves that we are a good team despite whatever our record says,” Tassopoulos said. “We’re not stupid, but we’re trying to be optimistic. We know it’s going to be a very tough game and a lot of things will have to go right [to win].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time in a long time, luck was on the Harvard men’s soccer team’s side on Tuesday night. After battling crosstown rival Boston University to overtime, the Crimson won its second game of the season, 2-1, after having lost or tied its previous five overtime matches.
Harvard (2-7-3, 0-2-1 Ivy) will look to build upon Tuesday’s win as it takes on conference opponent Princeton (5-5-2, 1-0-2) in New Jersey on Saturday.
“Some could argue that Tuesday’s game was one that we should have lost,” sophomore defender David Barna said. “But we’ve been unlucky a number of times and have definitely lost some games we should have won. We pulled it through in overtime which is definitely a hump we had to get over. I think we’re excited about the result and want to move forward.”
The Crimson has had its fair share of tough losses, dropping all but two of its seven losses by just one goal. Though Harvard has shown flashes of impressive play it has struggled to consistently put together a complete 90 minutes—or, if needed, 120 minutes—in order to have its record reflect its talent.
“At this point it’s a lot about pride,” Barna said. “We just want to pull out games and really show what we’re made of.”
The Tigers, coming off a Wednesday night loss to Adelphi, lead the all-time series 44-38-8 and have beaten the Crimson in each of the last three seasons. All signs point towards a relatively even game as Harvard tries to assert its presence in the top half of the Ancient Eight, while Princeton—which eked out a 1-1 draw against No. 18 Brown—makes a case for next Saturday’s matchup against conference-leader Cornell having Ivy League title implications.
“They had a tough loss [Wednesday] night, and they’re going to be trying to bounce back as we try to continue building momentum,” junior defender Ross Friedman said. “They have the home field advantage, but we have the confidence that we’ve been building towards. It should be a good game.”
After the Crimson’s winless conference campaign last year, finishing in the top half of the league is, as Barna put it, “a must” for Harvard coach Carl Junot and the program.
“In order to build for next year and live up to our potential, the biggest goal is to end on a good note,” Friedman said. “We’re taking it one day at a time but we want to—at the end of the day—show that we built something. So I agree it is a must.”
Finishing just ahead of the Crimson in last year’s final Ivy League standings were the Tigers who, despite being a consistently solid program and winning conference title in 2010, struggled through a similarly disheartening 2011-12 campaign.
“We consider it a rivalry—it’s always a tough game,” Friedman said. “They always get good players like we do each year, but they’ve had the same kind of thing. They just haven’t been getting the results.”
Chief among the talented players on the Princeton roster are the Sanner brothers. Matt, a senior, is tied for the team lead with three goals on 42 shots. Thomas, a freshman, has also netted three goals in addition to a team-leading five assists. Containing the Sanners and creating its own offense will be key to the Crimson coming away with the victory.
“It really seems as though we’re starting to establish an offensive identity,” Friedman said. “We’ve been getting chances but just not putting them away. The question all year has been, ‘Who is going to put it away?’ It was [senior Zack Wolfenzon] against BU, and now I think people are hungry to step up and take on that role.”
The offense, which is built around set pieces and counter attacks, has struggled so far this season, only scoring 10 goals in 12 games. Harvard has scored five in the last four games almost exclusively out of opportunities created by set pieces and counters.
“We have a good understanding now of what we can do offensively,” Barna said. “We’re appreciating what we’re good at and what we can do—now we just need to do it.”
With five games left on the schedule, the Crimson’s season is still salvageable. The team maintains that they are still treating it one day at a time, but there is definitely a feeling of urgency about Saturday’s game.
“We have a good chance to end on a good note and show that all our hard work has been worth it,” Friedman said. “This could be a turning point for Harvard soccer.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After defeating Cornell and Columbia on the road last weekend, the Harvard women’s volleyball team will look to reach three straight conference wins for the first time since 2009 when Dartmouth travels to the Malkin Athletic Center on Friday.
The Crimson (7-11, 4-3 Ivy), having reached the midpoint of Ivy League play, is currently tied for third place with Penn. Although Yale, undefeated in the Ancient Eight, holds a firm grasp on first place, a win against the Big Green (2-15, 1-6) would keep Harvard within striking distance as the conference stretch run begins.
The team’s outlook was not as bright after its opening conference games, as the Crimson suffered two back-and-forth, five-set losses—including one to Dartmouth. But since those defeats, Harvard has gone 4-1 in league play.
“The tough five-game matches told us that we were capable of hanging with teams for a long period of time, but what we needed to do was not hang with them but overcome them,” said freshman outside hitter Kathleen Wallace. “We definitely have the ability to overcome [teams] in the end, and I think we recognized that in the Cornell and Columbia games and were more motivated to get ahead of our opponent instead of just staying on pace with them.”
Following a straight-set loss to the Bulldogs at home on Oct. 6, the Crimson bounced back last weekend with 3-1 and 3-0 victories over the Big Red and the Lions, respectively. Although the scores appear lopsided, each game was closely contested; the largest margin of victory within a set was six points.
“We came out with a lot of energy and were really consistent,” Wallace said. “If our opponent got two or three points, we didn’t get frazzled, but we fought back.”
Harvard first matched up against Dartmouth in Hanover on Sept. 21, and the Big Green dealt the Crimson a five-set defeat that has been Dartmouth’s sole Ivy win.
A relatively young team with only two seniors, the Big Green is led by two outside hitters, sophomore Alex Schoenberger and freshman Paige Caridi. Both played a large role in Dartmouth’s victory, and Harvard will need to take advantage of sound defense and blocking to even the season series.
“The competition between all the Ivies is very close,” Crimson coach Jennifer Weiss said. “I think we took a lot from that five-set loss. We have a gameplan, and the team is determined to stick to that gameplan. It should be another good match.”
Harvard has threats of its own upon which it has relied all season long. Captain Taylor Docter, the leader of the Crimson offense, accounted for 14 kills against Cornell and 21 against Columbia, her second highest total of the season and more than double that of any Lion.
“[Taylor] has such high expectations for herself,” Weiss said. “She’s done a wonderful job; she’s worked hard every day in practice, and you can see that it pays off. Her composure on court as a senior and a top hitter in the conference was definitely there this [past] weekend.”
Much of Harvard’s offense has come from the combination of Docter and Wallace. Docter ranks second in the Ivy League with 208 kills, and Wallace is not far behind in fifth place with 179.
“I can always count on [Taylor] as a passer [and] as a hitter, and I know she’s always focused on her job and is going to try her hardest every kill,” Wallace said. “I never question her ability at all on the court, and it’s been an honor to play with her.”
The Crimson’s setting duties have been shouldered almost entirely by senior Beth Kinsella and freshman Hannah Schmidt. The pair, which has produced consistently in every game, accounts for nearly 90 percent of the team’s season assist total.
Harvard has experienced the pain of losing close, five-set matches, but it has also shown that it has what it takes to pull out big victories. Both Weiss and Wallace believe that the team is in a good position as it prepares to take on its Ivy foes for a second time.
“Our goal going into the second half would be to come out with a strong start and win when we can,” Wallace said. “We’ve seen everyone before. We know what to expect, and we’re prepared.”

October 15, 1875: Gentlemen of Liesure
There is a world-wide prejudice, I might almost say superstition, that a gentleman should never soil his hands with work. There was perhaps a time in America, when even those dignified personages in white wigs, knee-breeches, and gilt frames, of whom we are all so proud,—even if they be only distant cousins on the mother's side,—played a part almost manual in laying the foundation of the great country in which we live; but those days are past. The state has successively passed through the ordeals of creation and salvation, in the true old orthodox way; fortunes have accumulated; and there are hundreds of men among us now, who, fully impressed with the sense of their social importance and financial security, are determined to uphold their position in a manner that would be acknowledged by the most exacting to be truly gentlemanly.
October 18, 1946: Harvardevens, Livable but Expensive, Shapes Up as Real Community
Harvardevens Village, the spanking new home for 400 students and their families, isn't an overstuffed cherry bowl. Nor is, it for that matter, a thorny crown which the University is pressing on the brows of its married veterans. Being no exception to the rule on contentious subjects, the truth about. Harvard's newest project is someplace in between.
First off, the Village still looks immensely like the Army hospital it once was. Thirty-three miles lie between it and Cambridge, which means almost three hours of commuting each day and $17.95 out of the family exchequer each month. And the rents are thought by everyone to be too high.
October 16, 1968: Harvard Faculty Deficit May Reach $2.4 Million
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences may run a $2.4 million operating deficit--the largest in its history--in 1968-69, Dean Ford reported at yesterday's Faculty meeting.
Ford's budget report also showed that the Faculty had a surplus of more than $1 million for 1967-68, even though Ford had predicted a deficit last year.
The unexpected surplus last year, Ford said, came from "a better recovery than we had anticipated." But the 1968-69 budget will be much harder to rescue from its projected deficit than last year's was, he added.
October 20, 1972: West Germany To Air Movie About Harvard
A documentary on Harvard for German educational television, entitled "A Harvard Love-Hate Story" and focusing on Lowell House, is currently under production.
The camera is currently following Winthrop G. Minot '73, through seminar, lecture, library and sports scenes.
The film, which is directed by Christopher Cortis of Great Britain, is a Franco-German co-production sponsored by the United States Information Agency for Bavarian TV in Munich. It will be shown approximately 12 times in England, France and Germany, beginning in late spring next year.
October 19, 1981: Thousands Flock to 'Head'
"It was a day for topsiders and the windblown look. The water was rough and the beer was smooth," Mary Niehaus of Smith College said yesterday, and that pretty much summed up Sunday at the 17th annual Head-of-the-Charles Regatta.
From the discarded beer kegs and the cars blaring music to the people dancing on Weeks Footbridge and the amateur photographers, it was clear that many of the spectators at the river were there more for the atmosphere than for an intense interest in rowing.
Perched precariously atop the railing of the Larz Anderson Bridge or stretched out over blankets on the banks of the Charles, the spectators jockeyed for choice vantage points.
"This is the big New England college reunion," Charlotte Smith, a graduate of Williams College, said.

Harvard tour guides aren't the only ones talking up the John Harvard statue in the Yard. Thanks to a new Wikipedia page created on Oct. 12, the Internet is talking, too.
The page outlines the basic history of "the statue of three lies." According to the always credible Wikipedia, the John Harvard statue cost $20,000 to build and originally stood by Memorial Hall.
The page acknowledges the three official lies about the statue—it is not actually modeled after John Harvard and Harvard did not found the University, which opened in 1636, rather than 1638.
But Wikipedia neglects to mention what tourists are actually touching when they rub John Harvard's shoe. Well, what they don't know won't hurt them.

She only went here for nine weeks, and, sure, she doesn't actually have a Harvard "diploma" (in spite of this touching but tragically misleading photo), but these facts are mere technicalities for Tyra Banks, who spent last weekend back in her element, tweeting up an H-Bomb storm from her HBS Owner/President Management Program reunion.
Her few weeks as a Harvard student may have been hard ones for the supermodel, but these days Tyra is waxing nostalgic about the good old days when she ate with the plebeians and even sometimes saw them in their pajamas. After all, she met "amazing" people here, including these random fans and this one blonde woman (TyTy's Harvard BFF?) whom she taught to smize like a pro.
Complete with HBS cookies and a chocolate stiletto, this past weekend appears to have been a wild one for Tyra and her Business School buds, whom she's undoubtedly missing already. Just look at that longing gaze! What she wouldn't give to be back in the dorms...
