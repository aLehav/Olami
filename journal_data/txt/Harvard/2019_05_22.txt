After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s easy to dismiss critics of Gaspar Noé as unable to understand his artistic vision, but it’s just as easy to appreciate his work by immediately taking its convolution as artistry. Relative to the hardcore sex scenes in his 2015 film “Love” and the LSD-induced escapades in last year’s “Climax,” Noé’s newest project, “Lux Æterna,” feels tamer and easier to grasp. That’s not to say it IS tame: It’s a wildly disorienting experience that churns with anxiety and climaxes with strobe lights that could very well induce epilepsy. But Noé’s message is far more explicit, which thankfully takes away the typically harrowing experience of trying to make sense of his creations. In this meta “film within a film” that spans a short 51 minutes, he sharply critiques many facets of filmmaking for the extremely commercialised art form it has become and is quick to condemn the filmmakers who undermine the efforts of more rarefied artists. As is the Noé way, he prides himself in the unique absurdity of the pretentiously self-referential “Lux Æterna,” simultaneously criticizing the current state of entertainment and commercial media and proposing his film as the complete opposite and thus a truly artistic solution to a culture of rapacious materialism.
Béatrice Dalle, the film’s lead, is both Noé’s voice of truth and source of chaos, as she critiques the filmmaking industry while directing a film herself. During an extended conversation between her and Charlotte Gainsbourg — both of whom play themselves — Béatrice goes on about the questionable measures taken to make films about witch trials and burnings, which is also the subject of her film, but the two also reveal intimate stories about their lives. Dalle, hilarious in her honesty, laughs, “Fuck entertainment movies. They bore me.” (It sounds like these words have been taken directly from Noé’s mouth.) But her own movie is far from perfect: She barely has control over her set or the crewmembers and constantly quarrels with producer Yannick Bono. She runs around frantically giving people orders that they ignore, often goes off to cry in a corner, and wastes time fawning over Charlotte. To add to this chaos, Noé splits the extra wide screen in half, which either displays two different angles of the same person or portrays two separate scenes altogether. Though there isn’t much discernable dialogue anyways, it’s mentally taxing to try to keep up with both, so much so that the chaos is palpable through the screen.
More than anything, “Lux Æterna” seems most concerned with the film industry’s “ends justify the means” ethos. The opening sequence plays clips from Carl Theodor Dreyer’s “Day of Wrath,” a drama about witch trials, and as its protagonist falls from the stake into the fire, the narrator notes, “The actress was up there for two hours, it’s no wonder her face bore the expression of horror.” Béatrice recalls her own uncomfortable experience having to walk naked up a mountain while surrounded by men in order to shoot a scene in a movie, which she justifies, “But it was a beautiful movie. So who cares.” She doesn’t want to put her actors in similarly vulnerable situations, however, and treats them with as much care as she can muster. But as the producer defies her commands and activates neon strobe lights that set off pandemonium on set, Charlotte, who is tied at stake, struggles to untie herself and desperately screams for help. With his camera focused on her, Yannick directs, “Cry, Charlotte. You’re burning! You’re in pain!” He takes advantage of and captures her genuine misery in this moment of complete disorientation, thereby commercializing it and implying that acting alone could never achieve the intensity of emotion felt through a lived experience. The film hauntingly comes full circle: Despite Béatrice’s attempts, the methodology that made “Day of Wrath” so evocative in its raw emotion is also what ultimately fuels Béatrice’s movie.
Considering that Noé also asks a lot from his actors, this critique could be unintentionally ironic or self-aware — the answer probably depends on one’s opinions of Noé. But what “Lux Æterna” does make astoundingly clear is Noé’s dissatisfaction with filmmaking as it is today, and that he will continue to push the limits of the art form so that it remains true to his “higher” artistic values, no matter how controversial his work.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Corruption abounds in the world of a Romanian policeman in Corneliu Porumboiu’s latest feature, “La Gomera” (“The Whistlers”), which premiered in competition at Cannes. It’s entertaining and clever, and Porumboiu attempts originality by centering his story on a centuries-year-old secret whistling language inspired by the birds in La Gomera, an island in the Canaries — but beyond that, there’s not a lot of novelty to be found in this twenty-first century film noir.
Porumboiu’s non-linear storytelling jumps back and forth, following Cristi (Vlad Ivanov), a mid-career Romanian detective investigating a Spanish drug gang in Bucharest. The film opens with Cristi getting off a ferry to La Gomera, one of the Canary Islands, where he’s about to learn a secret whistling language from the drug gang that allows them to communicate, undetected, across multiple mountains on the island, and of course, across blocks of buildings in Bucharest. The police have arrested warehouse owner and drug dealer’s middleman Zsolt (Sabin Tambrea), who Cristi tries to help vindicate. But plans get complicated when his boss Magda (Rodica Lazar) quickly discovers his betrayal. He realizes she’s carefully watching him through cameras in his apartment at home, and when Zsolt’s girlfriend Gilda (Catrinel Marlon) makes Cristi a deal, she slides him tickets to Gomera under the guise of being his high-end prostitute, distracting the security cameras.
Whether he’s aware of it or not, Porumboiu’s main character epitomizes a man hitting a mid-life crisis: Cristi is a loner with the exception of his elderly mother, lacks some greater incentive or purpose, and unhappy with his career (why else exactly is he betraying the cops?). It’s unclear what side he’s really on — or why — until the ending, which unfolds in a grand albeit cheesy way. Ivanov deftly plays a somewhat aloof and rigid character, stoically hoodwinking both members of the drug gang as well as his authorities. Gilda superficially embodies the femme fatale with her beauty but not her brains. Make no mistake, she’s witty and has a few tricks up her sleeve, but her main allure to the other players in the game seem to be her beauty and charm. Porumboiu juxtaposes that role with Magda’s, who, although stunning, is cunningly exploitative with no sexual entanglements. She’s far more driven by her own greed and self-interest, and ruthlessly motivated to get what she wants.
“The Whistlers” is extravagant in the international terrain it covers outside of Romania: The drug lords are from Spain, whistling bootcamp takes place in La Gomera, a brief stint takes Cristi to Singapore, and Porumboiu even pays a small tribute to Hollywood, too, playing a Wild West Movie on the screen of the movie theater where Cristi and Magda secretly rendezvous. Then there’s the unfortunate American filmmaker walking into the secret warehouse at La Gomera commenting on how it’d be a great set for a movie, which is bit too self-congratulatory. It seems as if Porumboiu is trying to reach a more global audience, but the effort is amusingly forced and superficial. The dramatic opera music, which turns out to be a clever clue, brings in a nostalgic layer to the film. Dark lighting through much of the action scenes paired with dark humor in the dialogue cements the film’s place in the noir genre. Through and through, the aesthetics and cinematography of the film charmingly indulges the viewers.
Admittedly, the concept of the whistling is a clever touch — but it’s really just that: a touch. With cameras everywhere and phones tapped left and right, the whistling presents a refreshingly simple alternative mode of communication. Each letter or vowel matches a unique whistling sound, which produced by inserting fingers in the mouth in a certain way, and Cristi picks it up relatively quickly. It seems somewhat implausible that with the modern day technology used in espionage that the whistling codes would be so impenetrable. And there doesn’t seem to be some further purpose or symbolic meaning, as one might hope for from the title, for it. It’s not quite until the end that the whistling is somewhat important again, and even then, it’s only to tie up the loose ends of the plot. The result is an overstated but empty mechanism of the film, one with a shrewd plot twist that ultimately fails to add a new dimension to the film. But salvaging “The Whistlers” are the tantalizing film noir aesthetics, making it a pleasurable watch.

This review contains spoilers for the “Game of Thrones” series finale.
“There’s nothing more powerful in the world than stories,” Tyrion tells the ladies and lords of Westeros. It is precisely that — stories — which drew in over 40 million viewers per episode of “Game of Thrones” final season. But, with a world as large as the one in “Game of Thrones,” some stories will have a satisfying ending while others will not. With all the hype surrounding the final episode and so many different fan theories, the showrunners were ultimately going to leave fans unsatisfied in some way or another. While a certain amount of dissatisfaction is expected and acceptable, the real problem is the various ways that important characters were underutilized in the final few episodes or underdeveloped throughout the show.
Logistically, Bran makes sense as a king: He can learn from the mistakes of the past and know when an ally is planning on betraying him, while his fundamental lack of emotion should supposedly keep him from getting power-hungry. However, since Bran was always meant to be king, the writers of the show have done fans a great disservice by leaving his character wholly underdeveloped. Bran doesn’t even make an appearance in Season Five because he was, as showrunner David Benioff claims in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, “entering a training period… which isn’t particularly cinematic.” But if Bran is important enough to be king of Westeros, fans deserved at least a taste of what was going on in that cave during Season Five. At this point, there are far too many questions about the historical purpose of the three-eyed-raven, his connection with the Night King, and how, exactly, his powers are able to influence the past (which the incident with Hodor only hints at). While Bran is a logical choice for the throne in the eyes of Westerosi, he’s a bad choice as far as fans are concerned: We don’t know enough about him and his personality displayed the last few seasons has not made him particularly endearing.
Sansa and Arya were both drastically untapped: Although they both get a happy ending, it’s not satisfying in the least. Sansa has become a master manipulator and a skillful politician, learning from the show’s greatest masterminds like Littlefinger and Cersei. In this final season, she is reduced to a gossip, passing on secrets to Tyrion and sitting on the sidelines. Her character has been carefully crafted over seven seasons to create the perfect storm, and nothing would have been more satisfying than to watch as Sansa pulled strings behind the scenes and ended up on the throne.
Similarly, Arya fails to do much of anything in this final episode. After her epic ride through the decimated streets of King’s Landing at the end of the last episode, it seemed that Daenerys had finally made it onto Arya’s kill list. Instead of capitalizing on the mounting tension they created in the last episode between Arya and Daenerys, Arya sat on the sidelines with Sansa. Perhaps most disappointing is the show’s inability to take advantage of Arya’s unique ability to wear other faces. She hasn’t used this power since the first episode of Season Seven, and while it would be gimmicky to employ it over and over, the show shouldn’t have spent seasons training her if it wasn’t going to play an integral part in the final season.
And in the end, some things just don’t make sense. Why did none of the other six kingdoms think to secede after Sansa took the North? Is everyone really okay with letting Bran, who has never left the North, rule everything else in Westeros? Why did Grey Worm so easily let others make the decision about the next ruler and Jon’s fate? Could no one come up with a better name for the new king than Bran the Broken?
Despite it all, the final episode and this season as a whole were truly a cultural experience. The image of Daenerys looking out over her armies, as Drogon spreads his wings behind her, is absolutely breathtaking. Jon’s betrayal was a surprise up until the moment he killed Daenerys. Watching Drogon melt the Iron Throne behind Daenerys’ dead body, knowing that she never got a chance to sit on it, is a picture fans will not soon forget. Brienne’s final homage to Jaime — completing his entry in “The Book of the Brothers” with “Died protecting his queen” — is heartbreaking. There were many little moments in this final episode that were done just right, and these scenes should not be overlooked.
As its events didn’t turn out as many expected, ultimately a lot of fans will be rightfully dissatisfied with the ending. There are questions still to be answered, but maybe that’s to entice viewers to watch future spin-offs of the show. Regardless of the disappointments that riddled this final season, “Game of Thrones” nonetheless produced some of the best TV moments of this decade and for that, we should always be grateful.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay has appointed Jane Pickering as the new director of the Harvard Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Gay announced in an email to museum affiliates Tuesday.
Pickering’s five-year term as the museum’s director will begin in July. She has served as the executive director of the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture since 2013, where she helped to improve collaboration between the six museums that fall under the FAS’s purview, according to Gay’s email. Pickering has also served in curatorial and directorial roles at museums at Yale, Oxford, and MIT.
In 2016, President Barack Obama appointed Pickering to the National Museum and Library Services Board, which helps select National Medals recipients.
“She has thought deeply about the contributions and role of the university museum within the academy, the museum field, and our wider society,” Gay wrote.
Pickering will take over leadership of the Peabody as it faces a high-profile lawsuit from Tamara K. Lanier, a Connecticut woman who alleges the museum profits from 19th century daguerreotype photos of two of her ancestors, who were slaves at the time. The images — commissioned by Harvard biologist Louis Agassiz in 1850 in an attempt to prove a scientific theory of white superiority — are thought to be some of the earliest photos of American slaves in existence.
In an interview last month, University President Lawrence S. Bacow said the University does not profit off the images, which are public domain, and argued that “the law is on our side” in the suit. The museum receives around 10 requests per year to produce a high resolution image of the daguerreotypes, for which it charges $15 each, according to Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane.
Gay wrote in her email that, though FAS and the museum are already committed to “responsibly stewarding” the Peabody’s artifacts, they plan on “thinking in new ways” about the ethical responsibilities that come with holding its collections. The Peabody houses 1.2 million objects primarily from the Americas and the Pacific Islands.
“We need to consider how we engage with the communities from which these objects derive, how we grapple with difficult legacies like colonialism,” she wrote. “These considerations are accompanied by the real practical challenges of conserving and providing access to the collection.”
The email also announced the formation of a new Faculty Executive Committee of the museum concurrent with Pickering’s appointment. The group — which will report directly to Gay — is charged with formulating a new “institutional vision” for the Peabody’s collections.
“As Harvard looks critically at our own history and at the ethical, intellectual, and physical dimensions of stewarding this invaluable repository of human culture, I look forward to having Jane as a key partner and guide for me and other leaders at the University,” Gay wrote.
Gay will soon commence a search for Pickering’s replacement at HMSC.

Your four years at Harvard are (almost) over, which means that there’s no time like the present to actually do those “oh yeah, it would be cool to do that someday” activities on campus and around Boston. Grab your friends and try to conquer this list — you don’t want to look back on your college days and regret all of the things you never got to do!
Late Night Food Crawl
Treat yourself to the ultimate Harvard Square drunk food experience. After an evening of indulgence, try to hit all of the classics: Kong, El Jefe’s, Felipe’s, and Noch’s! Feeling ambitious? Add on as many other favorite stops as you want. You might as well come up with a point ranking system while you’re at it and determine the true winner among late night stops in the Square.
Night at the Museum
Whatever you do, don’t graduate without checking out the Harvard Museum of Natural History. Luckily, there’s a Senior Week activity the evening of May 22 where you can live out your wildest "Night at the Museum" dreams (complete with beer and wine) while finally checking this amazing spot off of your list.
Last Chance Dance
Let’s be real — who doesn’t have a regrettable memory or two from First Chance Dance? On May 23, you’ll have your chance to make up for that fateful night, or at least reminisce with your friends, at the Royale in Boston.
Arnold Arboretum 
The Arnold Arboretum is a gorgeous 281-acre area in Jamaica Plain filled with trees, plants, and plenty of paths to wander. As it turns out, it is affiliated with Harvard, so if you haven’t been before, you might as well go before you graduate. Take the Orange line to Forest Hills to infuse your senior week with a bit of nature.
Pay Homage to The Stores that Got You Through
What would the Harvard experience be without Tommy’s Value, Louie’s Superette, or University Wine Shop (for you Quadlings out there)? Return to the places that got you through it all, find the oddest things you can buy, and make some memories. Be sure to chat with Dr. Cheng-San “Louie” Chen at Louie’s if you’ve never had the chance — he often has stories to tell.
No matter how you spend your Senior Week, make sure to take advantage of everything that Harvard has to offer!

Before you head to commencement, here a few do's and don'ts for the special day!
DO: Dress Appropriately
Maybe leave the salmon shorts and “The Office”-inspired Halloween costume at home (yes, even the three-hole-punch, Jim). Chances are, you’re going to take all types of pictures with your family and friends and might have a graduation party or dinner to attend afterward. Whether you’re going business casual or reaching for the springy floral dress to wear under the robe, make sure to keep it comfortable yet appropriate for the occasion!
DON’T: Pregame the event
No, this isn’t Harvard-Yale, where you can take a drink every time the crowd cheers. You’ll probably want to remember your last day as a Harvard student as clearly as possible, and alcohol isn’t the best way to do that. Plus, accidentally tripping as you get your diploma isn’t a cute look.
DO: Eat Beforehand and Bring Gum
The ceremony is long, and no one’s interested in hearing your stomach grumble for more than three hours. Eat a fulfilling meal beforehand! It’s also going to be hot and your mouth’s going to get dry. Carrying a few pieces of mint gum or a box of tic-tacs in your pocket isn’t a bad idea. Plus, if your friend’s breath smells a little off, you won’t have to sit there in agony for too long.
DON’T: Fall Asleep During Commencement Exercises
Spoiler alert: Commencement speeches are long. If you thought Convocation was bad, you’re in for a ride. Harvard commencement speeches, however, are known for being really notable, if J.K. Rowling and Oprah Winfrey’s speeches are any indication. With Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel speaking this year, this year’s speeches are definitely worth your attention. If you’re really struggling, just stare at one of the deans trapped on the stage and try to guess how many times they blink per minute.
DO: Appreciate This Last Time with Your Classmates
Practically everyone in your grade — from your freshman-year roommates to the new friends you made during senior week — will be around to celebrate during this one final event. It’s like a giant meal at Annenberg, except everyone is sitting at the same table, and there’s no food. The classmates around you are still as unique and amazing as they were the first day you met them; enjoy every moment of it while you can.

Commencement would be incomplete without the amazing senior sales that have cheaper prices than Walmart. Everything — and we mean everything — is on sale. In fact, senior sales really make you wonder what people have in their dorms — and why. Here are some of the weirdest items that have been put up for sale.
Resume Portfolio: $5
Looks like this senior got the job of their dreams because they apparently don’t need this resume portfolio anymore. Whoever buys this will never have to worry about stumbling into a networking event unprepared ever again. This goes right up there with water as an essential item to carry around.
Dalmation Tail and Ears: Free
You clearly haven’t lived until you’ve graced Harvard’s campus with some endearing dalmation tail and ears on a cold Halloween night. These accessories probably have some funny stories behind it, and the next owner is bound to make their own memories with them as well.
Adorable Woven Cloth Poof: $25
You may be asking, “What exactly is a poof?” The real mystery is the fact that it was sold. Perhaps this will be a new sacred tradition among Harvard students as the adorable poof gets passed down from generation to generation, its purpose forever a mystery.
Movable Kitchen Table on Wheels: $60
This sounds like a rare artifact from the future. For $60, you can be 10 years ahead of your time and flex on your friends the next time they come over. It seems like this senior just couldn’t handle the clout of this movable table.
Mini Christmas Tree: $15
It’s never too early to start preparing for Christmas! This mini Christmas tree comes complete with fairy lights and small ornaments. What better time than May to start buying all the Christmas-time essentials! It’s rumored that a mini-Santa will actually come on his mini-sled to deliver some mini-gifts.
Supreme Backpack: $15
The real question is why you would buy this in the first place. Supreme arguably competes with Canada Goose for being one of the most sigh-worthy brands on campus. Make sure to complete the look with some salmon shorts and maybe a freshman lanyard.
Ceramic Dogs: $5
We’ve all experienced that empty hole in our hearts that just can’t seem to be filled up, some missing puzzle piece to a complete picture. Could it be true love that will fill the gap? A lucrative career? A stable family living and growing together? All of those are wrong because the obvious answer is this set of ceramic dogs.
Moose Pillow Pet: $5
Moose are amazing creatures. They’re even better in pillow pet form. Whether you just finished a hard organic chemistry final or are pulling an all-nighter at Lamont, these soft and comfortable pillows have definitely helped someone out. It’s especially a must for all Canadians!
If none of these items come across as strange to you, then you will probably host a senior sale with weird things of your own someday. At least we can find comfort in the fact that we all probably have some peculiar stuff sitting in our own dorms.

So, you’re graduating. Maybe you’ve got a job at Goldman lined up, maybe you’re taking some time off to travel, or maybe you have no idea what you want to do tomorrow — much less the next few months. Leaving the Harvard bubble to go into the real world is scary. Like the proverbial bird out of the proverbial nest, however, it’s time for you to soar out of Harvard and into summer. And what would summer be without a bucket list? Here are the 10 things you should do this summer post-graduation.
1) Thank somebody from your past.
This is your Oscars moment — the moment to thank your mom/little brother/elementary school teacher for all they’ve done for you. Send an email to somebody who helped you along the way to becoming a college grad. They’ll appreciate it.
2) Marie Kondo your life. 
No matter what your next step is, it doesn’t make sense to be toting around about 22 years worth of things. If it doesn’t bring you joy, toss it. Anything you get rid of now is one less thing you have to pack for your next adventure.
3) Freak out a little. 
Just a little. College is an intense time, and leaving to do something you’ve never done before (like be a real adult) can seem pretty daunting. Acknowledge it, journal about it, scream-cry with your friends about it, and then move forward.
4) Do one totally cliché summer thing. 
Tan outside for a day, go to a drive-in movie, or just spend an afternoon eating millions of popsicles.
5) Leave your hometown/new city/wherever you are for a getaway. 
You’re an adult now — nobody can tell you not to go on a road trip. Even a two-hour long vacation is still a vacation if you treat it like one.
6) Spruce up your resume. 
Change your LinkedIn headshot to one that makes you look like the esteemed college graduate that you are and, while you still can, connect with all the kids you were in section with who were super annoying but are definitely going places.
7) Learn to cook one adult meal.
It doesn’t have to be fancy; it just has to be something you could serve at a dinner party or to your grandmother when you want to show off how mature you are.
8) Figure out your finances. 
This bucket list item might not be very exciting, but it’s time to build that credit score (and figure out what a retirement account is). Hit up your friends in finance and see if they can explain the difference between a mutual fund and an index fund. Bonus points if you manage to stay awake during the explanation.
9) Write a letter to your future self. 
This is the culmination of 16 years of hard work, and a little nostalgia never hurt anybody. Maybe include a selfie too — you’ll never look this young again.
10) Take some time to relax. 
Catch up on sleep and spend a day (or two) doing absolutely nothing. After all, it is summer, and you deserve a break.
So fly away little birdies; fly out of this nest. Remember that you’ve got this. Summer should be fun, and this one is no exception. No matter what your future plans are, you made it this far. The rest is just life.
