After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Denise Cosby saw reports of a shooting on the Harvard campus headlining the evening news one Monday last month, she had no idea the victim was her son.It was only when one of his friends phoned her from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center that she realized Justin Cosby was not in the next room.Cosby, who suffered a bullet wound to the abdomen after a shooting in Kirkland House’s J-entryway, was declared to be in stable condition around 7 p.m. He died just eight hours later, with his mother at his side. He was 21.“This is a shock to my entire family and all my friends,” Cosby’s mother said. “No one can believe it.”Three days after the shooting, New York songwriter Jabrai J. Copney, 20, surrendered himself to the Cambridge Police and pled not guilty to charges of first-degree murder for Cosby’s death.Copney had been in contact with Cosby several times leading up to the incident to set up a meeting in Kirkland J-entryway, Assistant District Attorney Daniel Bennett said at Copney’s arraignment, though he gave no more information about the extent of their relationship.Copney, along with two unidentified individuals from New York, planned to scam Cosby out of drugs and money in his possession, and the police had recovered a pound of marijuana and approximately $1,000 on or near Cosby after he had been shot, according to Middlesex County District Attorney Gerard T. Leone, Jr. ’85. The Crimson reported last month that Cosby has been linked to drug sales to Harvard students.In interviews with The Crimson, those who shared a floor with Cosby and his mother shed some light on the victim himself, painting a picture of a boy always willing to lend a hand, often offering to help his neighbors carry the groceries.“He was a mama’s boy,” Denise Cosby said, adding that her son chose to live with her and commute 15 miles to Salem State College, which he attended part-time until this spring.Cosby, who had completed roughly three semesters’ worth of work, officially withdrew in April, school officials said. Although Cosby had not declared his major, Denise Cosby said that her son had shared his post-college plans of “going into computers and looking forward to a nice, comfortable life.”Friends posting farewell messages on Cosby’s Facebook profile page paid tribute to the amateur basketball player as a strong presence in their social circle who always had a smile on his face.Lucas R. Toffoli ’09, a resident of Mather House, first met Cosby in kindergarten. The two quickly bonded during recess, and by second grade, they could often be seen running around the King Open School playground and “terrorizing” others by pretending to be Ninja Turtles scaling the jungle gym.Though Toffoli acknowledged that he and Cosby drifted apart the following year, he said that he saw his fellow bright-eyed Ninja Turtle become a high school senior much respected within his circle of friends as the kind of person who would “really come through for you when you needed him.”Usually sporting carefully assembled “rapper-inspired” outfits—baggy T-shirt, baggy jeans, stylish basketball shoes, and “some bling from time to time”—Cosby was somewhat of a leader in his group of friends, Toffoli said. Or at least, Toffoli added, he was someone everyone knew and looked up to.Having known Cosby as a “well put together kid with his head on straight” who seemed to steer clear of “gang-like crowds,” Toffoli said the news of the shooting was all the more surprising.A Pokemon card aficionado in his childhood who once amassed an entire book of the much hyped collectibles, Cosby later channeled his energies into playing basketball and maintaining his ’95 BMW.“He was very proud of this car,” his mother recalled.Cosby said that she had no idea why her son, who lives with her in a high rise apartment building in Cambridge, was in Harvard Square the day of his death. Cosby also leaves behind his sister, Shenita, who flew in from Atlanta upon hearing the news, and his longtime girlfriend whom he met in college.“He was a good, young person,” said a neighboring tenant who identified himself only as “Leroy B.” and said he often played basketball with Cosby. “I hope justice is coming the right way.”—Staff writer Athena Y.

Two-time Pulitzer Prize winner John H. Updike ’54, who showed early signs of his writing prowess while walking the halls of Harvard’s English department, died in late January of lung cancer at the age of 76. Updike authored more than 50 books over the course of his decades-long career and won two Pulitzers for his works “Rabbit is Rich” and “Rabbit at Rest.”
Updike also served an eventful term as President of The Harvard Lampoon in 1953—kidnapping the president of The Harvard Crimson and orchestrating a close save of The Lampoon’s famed ibis statue. A noted perfectionist, he graduated summa cum laude the following year with a degree in English before going on to a fellowship at Oxford and a job at The New Yorker.
Michael J. Arlen ’52 met Updike when he arrived at The Lampoon as a freshman with stack of clippings from his high school newspaper tucked under his arm.
“He was one of those untroubled writers,” Arlen said of his younger colleague. Books, he recalled, came to Updike as effortlessly as dreams.
Many of Updike’s friends on The Lampoon came from wealthier backgrounds, but that did not stop the young writer—who grew up in Reading, Pa. and attended a small-town public school—from rising to the helm of the nationally-known humor magazine in 1953.
The writer’s humble background became a factor later, when the Signet Society—Harvard’s social club of arts and letters—almost did not accept Updike into their cloistered circle, since he could not pay the membership fee. Then-Crimson President Michael Maccoby ’54, who nominated Updike to the Signet, said that he convinced the Signet to waive Updike’s fees after telling them that if they did not allow him in, they would regret it for the rest of their lives.
Updike’s playful side will forever be memorialized in one 1953 incident that pit The Crimson and The Lampoon against one another. As Maccoby was walking back to Lowell House for lunch, Updike and three co-conspirators from kidnapped him, an act of retaliation for The Crimson’s earlier theft of the iconic golden ibis figure from atop The Lampoon’s building.
Updike, who was producing much of The Lampoon’s content while maintaining an exemplary academic record—he was one of only eight in his class to be inducted to Phi Beta Kappa as a junior—had little free time to devote to politics or parties, according to former Lampoon writer Eric B. Wentworth ’54, who lived in Lowell House with Updike.
Lewis L. B. Gifford ’51, who worked with Updike on The Lampoon, said Updike once showed him a bound volume of his early writings in his Hollis dorm room. The work had been typed by Updike’s mother, herself an aspiring writer who worked in a department store.
“It was like a premonition that he wasn’t fooling around—nor was his mother,” Gifford said.

Samuel P. Huntington was not afraid to launch his ideas onto the center of the intellectual stage, even when they sparked controversy. But friends and family said they will remember the bespectacled political scientist for his gentle, reserved nature and commitment to academia.The preeminent scholar of national security and civil-military relations died of congestive heart failure and complications related to diabetes on Martha’s Vineyard in December. He was 81.Huntington, who taught at Harvard for 58 years before retiring in 2007, was a gentle, yet quietly serious, presence in the government department, where he left behind a legacy of academic integrity and devotion to undergraduate education, colleagues said.“He was so brilliant that you wanted to learn as much as you could from him and try to be as honest and as serious about your work as he was,” said government Professor Stephen P. Rosen ’74, a former student of Huntington’s. “He was an inspiration...He was always there for his students.”Huntington’s most famous academic treatise posited that cultural and religious differences between the world’s major civilizations—rather than ideological disparities between political states—would be the cause of violent conflicts in a post-Cold War world.The theory drew controversy for its focus on differences between civilizations when it was first published in 1993. Some at the time criticized the work for reinforcing and oversimplifying cultural divisions.In 1996, he expounded on his argument in the book “The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order,” which has since been translated into 39 languages.“He was a scholar, first and foremost,” said wife Nancy A. Huntington ’55. “He knew that...there would be controversy but felt obliged to do what he thought was right and what was true.”Kennedy School Professor Graham T. Allison Jr. ’62 called Huntington “an outstanding teacher, a great thinker, and a valued colleague” who had the “rare capacity” for larger insights into overarching themes.“Not just big insights but grasp of truths that have legs,” Allison added in his e-mailed statement. “Among political scientists, or indeed, all social scientists today, he had no peer competitor.”Before retiring in 2007, Huntington served twice as chair of the government department and directed Harvard’s Center for International Affairs from 1978 to 1989.But Huntington’s work also took him beyond academia. In 1968, he advised then-Vice President Hubert Humphrey during his bid for the presidency. In 1977 and 1978, Huntington served as coordinator of security planning for the National Security Council under President Jimmy Carter.After suffering from a stroke in 2006, Huntington entered a succession of nursing facilities in Boston. He relocated the following summer to a facility on Martha’s Vineyard.—Staff writer Esther I. Yi can be reached at estheryi@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a typical day in his Kirkland suite, Michael “Mikey” J. Friedman ’11 could be found singing “Hakuna Matata,” playing with the protein modeling computer program Pymol, or coming up with some harebrained scheme to entertain and distract his friends, they said.The aspiring oncologist passed away in early October at the age of 19, bringing an end to his four-and-a-half year battle with desmoplastic small round cell tumor, a rare and aggressive form of cancer.Friends and family said that Friedman exuded brightness—both in his intellect and his personality. His optimism even in the face of a bleak prognosis was the first trait noted by all who spoke of him.Robert B. Schaaf ’11, one of Mikey’s roommates, described how Friedman once printed 50 or 60 copies of a photo that one of their other roommates found embarrassing and taped them to every possible surface in their suite (and put a couple up in Annenberg). On another occasion, he covered a roommate’s room in miniature green army men.In spite of his severe and progressing condition, Friedman remained committed to being a normal college student. On top of his regular course load during his freshman year (his illness forced him to scale back slightly on his classes this fall), Friedman worked at a cancer research lab at the Medical School, wrote for the Harvard Science Review, and, on a whim, joined the Hapkido club with Schaaf. “He had this way of keeping things in perspective, putting friendships first, people first,” said Mark A. Isaacson ’11, one of Friedman’s roommates.Though he took his studies seriously—he went to class until the day he was admitted to the hospital for the last time—and did well academically, friends said he rarely needed to do any work.During a remission in 2005, Friedman was granted a request by the Make-a-Wish Foundation. Rather than opting for a shopping spree, a meeting with a celebrity, or a trip to Disney World, he used the opportunity to found Mikey’s Way Foundation, a charity that raises money to improve entertainment facilities for children undergoing cancer treatment.Friedman observed during his multiple extended hospital stays that his physical well-being was greatly improved by alleviating the stress and boredom of treatment through simple diversions, like video games or DVDs.The foundation seeks to provide this relief for children whose families cannot afford these things. Since its creation, the foundation has raised more than a quarter of a million dollars for toys purchased for hospitals across the country.“It occurred to me that in some ways, because his battle with cancer so changed his perspective on so many things, the cancer that took him from us is also the cancer that gave him to us,” said Isaacson. —Staff writer Aditi Balakrishna can be reached at balakris@fas.harvard.edu.

Kathlene S. G. Joo ’11, a sophomore in Eliot House, died suddenly on the morning of May 3. Friends said that she combined a love for athletics and academics during her time at Harvard.Hoping to attend medical school, the Pittsburgh, Pa. native studied neurobiology at the College, and worked to complete the pre-med curriculum. Outside of lab and lectures, Joo stayed involved in the medical community as a member of the Harvard Cancer Society, with which she regularly volunteered at Massachusetts General Hospital.But Joo’s other passion was rugby, the rough-and-tumble sport that her friends said she embraced.“The one thing that I feel most summed her up is that she never backed down from a challenge—be it something huge like her torn ACL in rugby, or something as small as an arm wrestling match,” Radcliffe Rugby co-captain Morgan M. W. Jessee ’09 wrote in an e-mail.“Joo met life head-on, and it’s what I admire most about her,” Jessee continued. “She was an amazing person, a great friend, and her passing has left a huge void in many lives.”Known for her speed and agility, Joo—who teammates said went by her last name on the field—played the back position on the team. In that capacity, Joo handled offense, according to Aubrey M. Chamberlain ’10, who played on the rugby team with Joo last year.“She was definitely one of the more athletically advanced members,” Chamberlain said, adding that Joo “was gregarious, hardworking, and just very admirable.”Students familiar with Joo in science classes recalled her likability.“We worked on problem sets together,” said Kiara A. Tulla ’11, also a neurobiology concentrator in Eliot. “She was a really sweet girl, easy to work with.”Just hours after emergency medical personnel surrounded the front of Eliot House on May 3 between 2 and 3 a.m., barring students from entering the House, Master Lino Pertile informed Eliot residents of Joo’s death via e-mail.Later that morning, at around 10:30 a.m., College Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds notified all undergraduates of Joo’s death in an e-mail statement.Neither administrator’s e-mail disclosed the cause of death, but both emphasized the availability of counseling resources at University Health Services and the Bureau of Study Counsel for students coping with an undergraduate death—the last of four this year—while preparing for final exams.On May 3, Eliot House hosted an informal gathering in the Masters’ residence to commemorate Joo’s life with more than 40 people in attendance—some silently praying, some shedding tears, and others offering roses and other flowers in memory of Joo.—Staff writer Ahmed N.

Whether he was doing medical research in a Harvard lab, playing the violin as a section leader in the Mozart Society Orchestra, or just hanging out, Peter Cai ’10 could always be found with a smile on his face, friends said.The Adams House resident died suddenly late last October, going into cardiac arrest near Weld Boathouse after completing the men’s race of the semiannual River Run.“This is the worst type of tragedy,” said Adams House Master Sean G. Palfrey ’67. “It was unexpected, unexplained, sudden, and absolute. Despite having every possible resource available to help him, and despite the presence of two anesthesiologists who started resuscitation efforts immediately, there was nothing that could have been done.”After being rushed to Mt. Auburn Hospital by paramedics, Cai was pronounced dead just before noon. The 20-year-old’s parents arrived in Cambridge later that afternoon from their home in Pittsburgh and spent the evening with their son’s friends in Adams House.A shocked collection of friends remembered the aspiring doctor’s winning personality. “He was an inspiring person, deeply committed to science and medicine, but also very kind,” said Michelle C. Siao ’09, who worked in Professor Thomas P. Maniatis’s lab along with Cai.Siao recalled a story that Cai’s mother told about Peter receiving immunization shots as a baby. As the doctor came forward to administer the injections, the young Cai kept smiling.“He really did smile a lot,” Siao said.Julia Ye ’10 played in the Mozart Society Orchestra with Cai, who was section leader for the violinists.“He was always so enthusiastic about the orchestra, and he cared that all of the members were happy,” Ye said. “I always admired the genuine desire he had to make people feel at ease.”“It’s unthinkable that the world will not have a Dr. Peter Cai in the future,” Ye added.Anupriya Singhal ’09 and Cai were certified as CPR instructors together two years ago before becoming co-directors of Harvard Emergency Medical Services last summer. Although the group normally focused on training Harvard students, Cai decided to teach CPR to people in disadvantaged communities in Boston, Singhal said.“He wanted to build a sense of community in the organization, and he wanted the volunteers to understand the importance of what they were doing,” Singhal said.“You’d never guess from the way that he behaved that he was so brilliant,” said David Mattos ’09, who worked with Cai in the same laboratory and as a member of the Harvard Premedical Society, “He was very humble, very diligent, and very quiet. But not quiet in the shy sense. He spoke softly, but he was well aware of himself. He was certainly one of the smartest students that I knew at Harvard.”—Staff Writer Prateek Kumar can be reached at kumar@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When one of his friends was dealing with a bout of sadness, Clarel Antoine II ’07-’09 knew how to lift his spirits.Though it was almost midnight and the temperature was sub-zero, Antoine hastily made his friend put on a jacket and run outside to the frozen Charles River. Amid the snow and ice, the two friends stepped cautiously onto the frozen river and back to its bank. Antoine died suddenly in late December of last year. Those who knew Antoine said they remembered his vivacity, charisma, and empathy.“If anything really characterizes Clarel, it was how intensely he loved people,” said Antoine’s girlfriend of three years at Harvard. She asked that her name not be used because of the sensitive nature of Antoine’s death.The son of immigrants, Antoine came to Harvard in September 2003. After having nearly finished a five-year music program, he was preparing to graduate in January.Second to his considerate nature, Antoine’s friends and peers recalled his passion for music.According to Antoine’s ex-girlfriend, he studied at the Manhattan School of Music before college. During his year-long leave of absence in 2006-2007, he worked as a steward at the Boston Opera House, where he watched music performances for free.Antoine could always find time to talk about his plans for the College’s music department, said Charles W. Altchek ’07, who had known Antoine since their freshman year at the Horace Mann School in New York, nine years ago. Antoine, who played the violin and piano, had wanted to expand the interaction between the music department and undergraduates, Altchek added.The stress of planning and performing in the Class of 2007’s freshman musical—which Antoine produced—was palpable, according to Daniel A. Koh ’07, who sang in the show and lived in Thayer Hall with Antoine.But while people were tensing up about the next act, Antoine was backstage cracking jokes, Koh said.Antoine’s ex-girlfriend joked that this “sweet” personality got him a free pass. “Once he handed in his term paper two-and-a-half months late in a class, and he still got an A- on it,” she said. “Certain rules didn’t apply to Clarel. For some reason, he was the exception. He was so touching. You always wanted him to succeed—whether you were a TF, a friend, or a peer. Everyone was rooting for him.”Though music and people were essential to his life, Antoine had diverse interests. He learned Spanish, French, and German. He played soccer and tennis, and he swam. During his year off, he studied to become a pastry chef while working at the local Whole Foods.“He wanted to make sure that he was always learning and growing and meeting new people,” Altchek said.Antoine’s family would not take phone calls, and the cause of Antoine’s death remains undisclosed.—Staff writer Ahmed N.
