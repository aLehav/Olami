Creating a perfect song is a presumptuous goal for a small town girl from Columbus, Ohio trying to make it as a musician in the Big Apple. But despite the book’s opening, Laura, our protagonist, is much more self-aware — and a touch meeker — than this aim makes her seem as she navigates the many obstacles thrown in her path. Emily Gould’s “Perfect Tunes” is a whirlwind of a story that explores dreams, mental illness, and how to balance love for others with love for your art. “She had never been in love. She was in love with her music,” Gould asserts in the book’s opening. Though the narrative is heady and sometimes ill-structured, Gould’s blunt, conversational style and her narrator’s clear observations, unburdened by sentiment, carry the book forward with entertaining rapport.
Gould co-runs an online feminist bookstore entitled EmilyBooks with fellow writer Ruth Curry, and “Perfect Tunes” is her third book. The novel takes the aspiring musician trope and turns it on its head. Laura, after moving in with her high school best friend, cool-girl Callie, and finding herself a “gross” waitressing job, falls head over heels for Dylan, a “bad boy” guitarist in an up-and-coming band. When he dies, cutting their tumultuous yet passionate relationship short, she is left to grapple with losing him as well as her dreams as she discovers she is pregnant with his baby. In Part II, Laura’s dreams have all but disappeared into the normality of her Brooklyn family life — married, with kids and a teaching job. Yet the ghosts of her past continue to haunt her in the shape of Callie, famous after joining Dylan’s former band, and her teenage daughter Marie, who struggles, like Dylan, with depression.
“Perfect Tunes” taps into a universal curiosity about our parents’ minds and past lives, which often seem mysterious and irreconcilable with their parental roles. As children, it is difficult to imagine that our parents might have once had big dreams, as if ambition is only for young people. More than this, the novel imagines one of the many stories of aspiring artists who never make it into the spotlight. Yet, as a protagonist, Laura is both an intriguing and unsatisfying narrator. Her sharp insights, encased in matter-of-fact delivery, build a fully dimensional world based in gritty reality, even in the face of her rather unoriginal castle-on-the-cloud artistic dreams. Despite this astute awareness, she often allows her emotions to govern her actions, allowing life to happen to her — particularly in the case of many of her relationships. Frustratingly, she accepts, and perhaps even desires, toxic relationships.
Her friendship with Callie persists well into adulthood, as she continues to accept Callie’s mistreatment of her feelings, knowing that “this would always be a good friendship exactly to the extent that she wanted to be molded.” Even her relationship with Dylan, despite its brevity, was characterized by her choice to put her own desires and dreams aside for the sake of his attention. Though these narratives display how easily one might continue to engage in and find happiness in toxic relationships, it also glamorizes them in a detrimental way, which is particularly damning due to the book’s portrayal of mental illness.
The second half of the novel is its strongest part, with insights into blended families, young motherhood, teenage mental illness, and buried ambition. Yet the novel seems to linger on the first half’s hazy party scenes and blind young passion for what seems like an eternity, while zipping through the complex relationships and feelings encountered in its latter portion. This hesitation does the narrative a disservice, thereby failing to fully develop the intricacies of Laura’s relationships with her daughter, her husband, and herself, as her unfulfilled aspirations attempt to breach the surface of her busy life. The structure deficiencies extend to the choice to tell parts of the second half of the story from Marie’s point of view. Though this illuminates valuable insights into her struggles with depression, the novel’s focus remains on Laura’s interests and desires, leaving the treatment of mental illness again underdeveloped.
Complicit in the underdeveloped portion of the story is the point-of-view narration that gives the novel a tendency to wander too deep inside the characters’ psyches. The reader finds themself dizzy with the whirling thoughts and emotions of the characters, and this over-attention to inner thoughts comes at the price of meaningful dialogue that might build important connections between characters.
“Perfect Tunes” echoes the story within its pages — an ambitious, entertaining, and clever concept with valuable stakes in its portrayal of dreams, love, and mental illness that never quite attains its potential. It remains, however, a fun, provocatively realistic look at the nature of talent and dreams, and it ultimately paints a compelling image of optimism and the strength of a person’s love for their art.
CORRECTION: February 26, 2021
A previous version of this article stated that “Perfect Tunes” is Emily Gould’s debut book. In fact, it is her third book.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is not much uncharted ground to cover in the realm of high school coming of age stories, but the new Netflix original film “The Half of It” manages to subvert expectations at every turn. Director Alice Wu's film is quiet and introspective, yet hilarious and charming, packed with rich relationships to carry the film and even make certain cliches feel new.
In “The Half of It,” Ellie Chu (Leah Lewis) is a solitary, brusque high school senior who doesn’t fit in in the tiny town of Squahamish. She writes her classmates’ essays for money until her neighbor Paul (Daniel Diemer) who doesn’t “speak very good” hires her to write love letters for his crush Aster (Alexxis Lemire). The Cyrano de Bergerac-esque scheme spirals out of control as everyone develops relationships they don’t expect and Ellie finds herself falling in love with the recipient of her letters.
Wu adapts a distinctly melancholic tone that complements the understated setting and plot. This effect is established from the beginning, which features an animated intro with a voiceover about the ancient Greeks, ethereal music, and a muted blue color scheme. The mood matches perfectly with the setting: The small, religious town of Squahamish feels like a real living, breathing place. It’s a place where no one wants to be yet no one can imagine abandoning, a dichotomy that leaves tension hanging over the film. The subdued plot has no explosive arguments or bursts of passion, making the emotional beats feel more grounded.
The film revolves around words and language, with its talented writer of a protagonist crafting love letters for a boy whose defining trait is his inability to express himself. Ellie writes profusely, but hardly speaks a word — she falls in love almost entirely through letters and text messages. Wu uses different shots and settings to keep the film visually interesting by having characters meet in Catholic confessionals, abandoned trains, and hidden hot springs, but hardly anything happens besides people talking to one another. There are some points in the first half where the film’s lack of action almost becomes a drag, but fortunately the film is packed with wonderful dialogue that ranges from witty to profound. The dialogue does not always sound organic — not many teenagers quote existentialist philosophers and some of the stereotypical dumb jock characters say impossibly inane things — but each character’s lines feels true to their voice and certain exchanges flow beautifully.
The strongest part of the film lies in the relationships between its central characters. Each one is unique and heartfelt; the actors who play Ellie, Aster, and Paul all have incredible chemistry with one another, and the ebbs and flows of attraction, friendship, and rejection all feel natural. Everything is tinged with a genuine teenage awkwardness and uncertainty that makes the plot more believable. And while Ellie states at the beginning that it’s “not a love story,” the film covers every type of love. The feelings blossoming between Ellie and Aster are as intense as they are repressed from the very beginning. Their textual exchanges are veiled by deception and their attraction in person is hidden, developing in private spaces or from quiet cursory glances. In the scenes where they do interact, Wu directs creative shots where the two share a glance through a reflection in a bathroom mirror or float parallel to one another in a spring — both breathtaking moments full of quiet tension. However, the standout arc of the film is the friendship between Ellie and Paul. Their characters complement one another uniquely, encouraging the other to grow and change their perspectives. By the end, Paul (an aspiring sausage chef) is even learning to make Chinese five spice pork with Ellie’s father. It is rare to find platonic relationships at the heart of a teen movie, and this one is quirky, laugh-out-loud funny, and full of heart.
“The Half of It” does fall into several of the same traps as other teen rom coms. Ellie is repeatedly harassed by stereotypical bullies with bad insults, and no apparent reason for targeting her besides the fact that she’s “different.” There is even an obligatory talent show scene that barely fits into the rest of the plot. Wu takes on big questions about identity, acceptance, and the meaning of love, but doesn’t quite offer perfect answers to any of them. Still, the film approaches its predicaments in a way that feels fresh, careful, and real. That sincerity, paired with captivating dialogue and relationships, makes it more than easy to forgive the film’s shortcomings.

“If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.”
This year’s graduating class is finishing college during the most consequential health event of the century. The COVID-19 pandemic will reshape every facet of our lives for decades to come. For the graduating Class of 2020, COVID-19 has been transformational already, radically altering the last few months of classes and commencement celebrations. Their ideas about the future now look very different.
Those differences extend beyond just wondering whether new jobs or schools will start remotely. At its core, this pandemic is laying bare underlying dynamics in our world — and making plain the decision we face about where to go next. We have two choices. We can “go alone” — leaving everyone to solve their issues individually. Working alone can be fast, and in a pandemic, speed can feel like the ultimate goal. But speed won’t get us very far. Alternatively, we can “go together” — and work collaboratively to make longstanding changes. It will be slower at first, more deliberate. But it will get us further toward a safer, healthier world. The choice is up to us. And, most of all, it’s up to the next generation of entrepreneurs, researchers, and leaders in this graduating class.
The speed with which this pandemic has spread reflects the preeminent influence of globalization. Along with many low- and middle-income countries, China has become far more international in its trade, business, and education, creating a more interconnected and interdependent world. The amount of travel from China to the United States increased nearly 20-fold between 2003 (during the last SARS outbreak) and 2017. That globalization meant that once the virus started spreading in Wuhan, it likely reached countries around the world within weeks, if not days. There are two ways we can respond to this: we can put up walls, shut down travel, restrict trade. Or we can remember that, because of our highly globalized world, the viral genome sequenced in China led to the development of a diagnostic protocol a week later in Germany, which led to the approval of tests in South Korea and elsewhere weeks after that. Science, innovation, and knowledge can spread even faster than the virus. Instead of retreating from the globalization that helped create this pandemic, we should lean into it, addressing its challenges but leveraging its benefits.
The pandemic has upended our mental models of global leadership. In our old model, knowledge was generated in the Global North and shared with the Global South. This viewpoint — always woefully inaccurate — is now clearly absurd. Which nations have most mismanaged the pandemic? Western Europe and North America. Where has quick and decisive governance, along with shrewd use of technology and public health interventions, kept the outbreak under control? Southeast Asia and, increasingly, sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, all of which have fared better than many high-income countries. Some Americans and Europeans will resist this upending of historical power dynamics, hoping for a return to a unipolar world where science and knowledge supposedly emanated from the Global North. But that return is no more likely than a return to obsolete systems of trade, travel, or communication. Instead, we should embrace the multi-polar world: go get a Ph.D. in Singapore or learn economics in India. The center of gravity isn’t shifting away from institutions like Harvard — but it will be shared by institutions like China’s Tsinghua University. In a post-COVID world, innovation will come from around the globe, drawing on the full diversity of global experience and leadership.
Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced us to reconsider the public-private divide. This supposed fissure falls along traditional political lines – with some favoring governments and others, the private markets. But in the race to develop vaccines, test therapies, and manufacture medical equipment during the pandemic, the world has turned to public-private partnerships. The private sector drives much of the research and manufacturing, leveraging its ample resources and new ideas. Meanwhile, the public sector funds large portions of this, with the promise that new products will be made widely accessible. After the pandemic, we could revert back to the outdated binary, with some viewing the private sector as greedy and self-serving and others claiming that the government is necessarily ineffective. Or we can reject that false choice and embrace the duality, building new efforts to solve complex problems.
Undoubtedly, the COVID-19 pandemic has been devastating. But it also has highlighted our communal strengths, sparking a sea of innovation while shattering global barriers. The pandemic has fundamentally altered our mental models of where information comes from and how the world needs to be run. We can look at these phenomena and panic, retreat, and try to recreate the world as it was before. But this is both foolish and hopeless. As the graduating Class of 2020 leaves Harvard, they enter a world where they can make a different choice. They can choose to work together, to embrace knowledge from, and create knowledge with partners from around the world. We can walk through the door that this pandemic has opened for us, welcoming new models of collaboration and creation.
If we do, we can go much farther. Together.

Congratulations to the Class of 2020! I remember that sweltering day in June — back then Commencement was in June — the pride my family felt, the mix of elation and wistfulness shared with classmates, and the wonder and anxiety of leaving Harvard Yard for a future uncertain. You likely feel similar emotions even amidst the circumstances that abruptly sent you from campus weeks ago.
It is true that you are moving forward in a world forever transformed. In what ways, we still don’t quite know. Much like the climate crisis bearing down on all of us, COVID-19 has brought to light the existing fragilities and disparities that persist in just about every aspect of civic life from how we work and go to school; receive our food, housing, childcare, access healthcare and transportation; and even how we vote. Confronting those realities has been painful and challenging. But in this moment lies tremendous opportunity, for society and for each of you. With the degree you now hold, well-earned and to be celebrated, you have both the power and the privilege to go forth and make the most of that opportunity — the opportunity to build a world that better serves the interests of all of humankind. Since so many existing norms have been destroyed or at least disrupted, you will be part of building in new and better ways. As you go forward, I hope you consider a few things.
First, there’s a difference between working in public service and working for the public interest. I work in public service, and I deeply value the work of those in public service and know that we need bright, capable graduates to join our ranks. But working for the public interest means that regardless of where you work, you invest time, energy, and even treasure to make your communities stronger and to make sure that every person regardless of zip code, race, income, religion, or country of origin is treated with dignity and respect. In whatever field or profession you find yourself, I hope that all of you will work for the public interest.
Second, your communities and support systems are important. You’ve learned that from the friends you’ve made here. Maintain those connections as you move forward and build new ones. Last spring, I lost my Kirkland roommate, teammate, and best friend to cancer. Never did I imagine a woman and mother so young, fit, and healthy could be taken away. Don’t wait for funerals or pandemic-inspired Zoom calls to reconnect with people. Take care of your friends and support networks and make time to do that regularly. You will hopefully go through more ups than downs, but either way, you will be richer for those relationships.
Third, challenge yourself. Many of you are perfectionists and have pushed yourselves hard for as long as you can remember. That’s not what I’m talking about. Rather, challenge yourself by confronting your insecurities and the self-doubt that will inevitably creep in from time to time. You have more strength and resilience within you than you’ll ever know. All you need to know is that it’s there.
Finally, embrace empathy. In my job as Attorney General I’m constantly confronted with problems that sadly seem to stem from a lack of empathy. Whatever you do, wherever you go, try to see life through the lens and experience of another person, especially a person different from you. How many people can speak to the experience of being a grocery store clerk, personal caregiver, or bus driver? How many times have we looked past them or not noticed them before coronavirus? Take the time to see one another, talk to one another, and listen to one another. It will help us build a better community and government if you do.
You’ve worked hard, you’ve earned it, and you should celebrate as much as you can in this socially distanced moment. But remember, it’s not the degree that’s special — it’s the opportunity to make the most of it.

Before I give you my sincere wishes for your futures, I have to ask: Is fortune the top priority for your future, and is fortune purely monetary in nature?
I hope you answered no to at least one of these questions.
I, like you, was looking at graduating into a recession in 2009. I, however, graduated with $104,000 in student loan debt and hope that none of you have to deal with that. I moved to China after graduating because I studied East Asian Studies and there wasn’t really a recession there so I was lucky enough to find a job. My salary was quite low because the fashion industry pays poorly but also because the cost of living was so low. So I’ve worked to barely survive and lived my entire adult life in debt, and yet I can honestly say that I’ve generally felt successful.
So how could I feel like I’m doing so well if society and tradition and logic are all telling me that I’m not? Well, I think it really all comes down to my health. My Uncle Jim had a stroke in his 30s and eventually became paralyzed, and he eventually lost his will to live last year. He always told me “Timothy, if you don’t have your health, you don’t have anything”, and that rings truer now than ever before. So my first sincere wish is for your individual and collective health.
My second sincere wish for you is to find your own path and purpose. The world is experiencing nothing short of a paradigm shift, and the reason I was initially attracted to China was because I wanted to witness the country’s transformation and my own. With this new environment you are no longer beholden to convention, and you can be whatever you want to be. My first business card said “Fashion Theorist” and no one really understood it, including myself, but I created my own path!
So no matter what you want to do, please don’t hold yourself back and do not let circumstances hold you back. Let this environment force your adaptation and your evolution. Try and look at the world as something of a tabula rasa, malleable and primed for the visions of youth to bring about a more perfect future. And the vision doesn't have to be big. It was my small acts of kindness that I am now most proud of, and it will take many to weather this storm. And some will weather it better than others, but this past decade has taught me that you not only have your own path but you will also traverse it in your own time.
So go your own way, and at your own pace. Take it day by day, breath by breath.

Gunnar L. Allison ’20 envisioned proposing to his high school sweetheart Jessica R. Davis in a winter wonderland — but, thanks to a government shutdown, his careful plans were nearly derailed.
In December 2018, the couple visited Colorado. Allison had spent months planning their trip; they would stay outside of Rocky Mountain National Park, and he and Allison would snowshoe up the Emerald Lakes Trail, where he would propose. Just before the trip, Allison averted one crisis: Davis asked him if he was planning on proposing, and he vehemently denied it, successfully hiding his plan.
The night they arrived, however, there was another snag: The entire national park was closed due to a national government shutdown. In a moment of serendipity, though, a trail just outside the park was open and led to the appropriately named Gem Lake. The couple hiked to the iced-over lake where Allison knelt down and proposed in the winter wonderland he had hoped for.
The couple, both of Rogersville, Mo., met freshman year of high school — the two had shared a class, but were both a bit intimidated.
“Gunnar is a larger person,” Davis said, “so I thought he was actually a senior, so [I was] a little scared freshman.” They became closer sophomore year, though the academically-focused Allison was initially reluctant to date during high school. After Davis convinced him to come to her house to study for an exam, he asked her out: Steak ‘n Shake, a Midwestern burger chain, followed by mini golf.
Davis, a vegetarian, just had a milkshake, and, unbeknownst to Allison, hated mini golf.
“I sent a horrible impression on the first date,” Allison said. “It's amazing that we went on a second one.”
When Allison was accepted to Harvard, the couple decided to weather long distance while Davis remained close to home at Missouri State. This decision, the couple said, helped solidify their feelings for each other.
“Anytime we thought about [breaking up due to distance], we tried to imagine our lives without each other,” said Allison. “Those kinds of ideas or prospects scared us even more than continuing to do long distance. And over the years, it just sort of made more and more sense that we're going to spend the rest of our lives with each other.”
And now, the couple that got engaged during a government shutdown will get married during a pandemic.
The Ozark region, where they are both from, has not been severely impacted by COVID-19. The couple had planned on a June wedding, and they’re keeping their date, though modifying their plans. Friends from out of state will be unable to attend, and masks and social distancing will be encouraged, but Allison and Davis are excited to celebrate with their families.
Since October, the couple had been planning to move to Houston, Texas after the wedding, where Allison would work as a mechanical engineer for an energy company while Davis began graduate school at Texas A&M University. Now, Allison is back on the job search, but the couple is hopeful they will make it to Houston.

Maxwell Lent ’20 knew early on that he wanted to marry Sarah R. Broniscer.
They were introduced by mutual friends in September of their junior years of college, when Lent was attending Harvard, concentrating in History of Art and Architecture, and Broniscer was enrolled at Barnard, majoring in Psychology and Religion. After an hour-long first phone call, the two decided to meet up in person when Lent next returned home to Long Island for one of the Jewish holidays. Their date — a visit to the Metropolitan Museum of Art followed by lunch in the city — lasted so long that Lent’s family texted him to come home and Broniscer’s friends began to worry.
Within two months, Lent realized that she was the one. “We met at the end of September of 2018, and by November, Max was already making comments about getting married, and I was like ‘oh my god, relax,’” Broniscer laughed. But she came around to the idea pretty quickly. On a hiking date that New Year’s Eve, Broniscer said to Lent, “Yeah, I think I want to marry you.”
Living in different cities and still attending school, the couple didn’t officially get engaged until August 2019. On their second date in Central Park, Broniscer had told Lent that she always dreamed of going boating in the lake there. “I noted that down early on as something to surprise her with,” said Lent. So, one evening in mid-August, Lent took her out on a boat and then proposed, with friends and family members watching from a distance.
Fast forward to March 10, the day Harvard announced that undergraduates had to move out, and Broniscer had just arrived on campus to surprise Lent. He had already planned a party to celebrate Purim, which, given the news, turned into a combination of dancing and “cry-laughing,” Broniscer said. After Broniscer moved out of Barnard, the couple decided to quarantine together at Lent’s house. “Max and I knew that if we were going to get stuck somewhere, we wanted to be stuck together because we were planning a wedding, planning a life,” she said.
The wedding, scheduled for June 7, was going to be held in an old airline terminal at John F. Kennedy International Airport that has been converted into a hotel. It was supposed to be a big event of around 500 people — friends and family from all over the world.
The couple is keeping the date, but everything else has changed. “As of now, it’s just going to be immediate family in the backyard,” Lent said. “We want to have more of just a party at some point in the indefinite future. Definitely at some point.”
After their backyard ceremony, the couple plans to move to Philadelphia, Penn. where Broniscer will begin law school at the University of Pennsylvania and Lent will seek a job. There, the newlyweds will start their lives together.

Kayla R. Lentz ’20 and Ian M. McConnaha first met when they were two years old, in their hometown of Plymouth, Wis. Their older siblings attended the same daycare, and soon, their families became friendly. Five-year-old Lentz and McConnaha attended kindergarten together, but McConnaha’s family moved to St. Louis, Mo. before first grade.
From then on, the pair were pen pals.
“In part it was maybe our parents wanting us to practice cursive,” said Lentz, “but it was really fun.” She remembers mailing McConnaha a paper cutout of Flat Stanley from the titular children’s book for a school project, and receiving photos of her Flat Stanley at the Gateway Arch and Busch Stadium.
Around fifth grade, McConnaha’s family moved back to Plymouth, and the pair resumed their friendship — until freshman year of high school, when McConnaha asked Lentz to the homecoming dance.
The couple has been going strong ever since — there was no question that they would stay together during college, as Lentz moved to Cambridge and McConnaha stayed in state to attend University of Wisconsin-Stout.
“Why would that even be a consideration to not try and make it work long distance?” said Lentz. “I don't think there was ever any question that that wasn't going to be.”
“I hadn't stopped loving her then, so might as well keep going,” McConnaha added with a laugh.
By sophomore year of college, the couple was discussing marriage, and during winter break of their junior year, McConnaha bought a ring.
The couple wouldn’t be reunited until that summer, so McConnaha planned a proposal for when they both returned to their hometown. Since high school, Lentz and McConnaha had shared sunrise dates on Lake Michigan, taking in the view and grabbing breakfast afterwards, and this tradition felt like a fitting setting for a proposal.
On a particularly early morning in the summer of 2019 — the pair woke up around 3:30 a.m. — McConnaha popped the question along the lake. McConnaha had enlisted his younger brother to wake up with him and follow in a separate car to take photos of the proposal.
Following their engagement, the couple decided to wait two years for a wedding, so their plans for summer 2021 have not been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Until then, the couple will stay close to home: Lentz is hoping to work near Plymouth while applying to medical school, and McConnaha will work in construction management. When they do get married, it will be at the same parish where their families first met, close to 20 years ago.

Anna M. Schuliger ’20 and Liam S. Fitzgerald first discovered their romantic chemistry in, perhaps fittingly, a high school chemistry class.
It was their junior fall at the Boston Latin School. “There was this cute guy in my AP chem class – we had a huge class, so I hadn’t really seen him before,” Schuliger said. She asked to be his lab partner. “I don’t even remember the experiments we were doing,” she laughed. “But I remember that Liam smashed a beaker.” Fitzgerald jumped in, clarifying that “it was a spectrophotometry experiment, and it wasn’t a beaker, it was a cuvette.”
It took “forever” for him to ask her out, Schuliger explained, and they were in totally different circles — he was a “hockey player and a science guy,” whereas she was a “total theater geek” who liked English. Eventually, she made the first move, asking him to go to the movies one Friday. She wrote her cellphone number on his electron configuration worksheet. He took her up on that offer several weeks later, and they saw “The Hunger Games” sequel “Catching Fire.”
The couple dated all through the rest of high school, navigated long distance during Schuliger’s gap year in Germany, and then split time between University of Massachusetts, Amherst, where Fitzgerald majored in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Harvard, where Schuliger concentrated in English with a secondary in Linguistics.
They had discussed their engagement before Fitzgerald finally popped the question. “I always felt that the surprise should be when it happens and where it happens, the surprise shouldn’t be if it was going to happen or not,” Fitzgerald said. “So I knew that if I proposed, Anna would say yes… Other than that, everything was kept a complete surprise.”
After talking to his family and Anna’s parents to receive their blessings, Fitzgerald took Schuliger for a walk along Crane Beach in Ipswich, Mass. in January 2019, where he proposed.
They planned to get married June 14 — and they still will, but in a different manner than they expected. They had initially invited around 180 people to a wedding ceremony at Jack’s Abby Brewery in Framingham, Mass. Now, they will be marrying at the Arnold Arboretum with only immediate family members. Schuliger’s brother and sister won’t make it, because they’re in Canada — where her family now resides — on student visas, and the pandemic has made it more difficult to cross the border and return.
“We’ve kind of reframed the day to make it special in its own way… an elopement of sorts,” Schuliger explained. The couple adjusted event plans over Zoom from their respective quarantine locations in Vancouver, Canada and West Roxbury, Mass. Schuliger shipped her wedding dress to a tailor in Canada and will soon bring it back to Massachusetts to wear. After the ceremony, they plan to take wedding photographs across an empty Boston with a local photographer.
For now, they will have to put visions for a bigger celebration on hold. “I mean, who knows what the world will look like in a year, but we’re hoping to do a vow renewal ceremony with all the people we invited to our wedding,” Schuliger said. “But we’ll see how this all plays out.”
“It’s really just made us focus more on what this is actually about, which is our marriage to one another. And that’s what really matters in the end,” Fitzgerald added. The two will move to San Diego, Calif. this summer, where Schuliger will look for a job in the arts while Fitzgerald begins medical school in the fall at the University of California, San Diego.

When Patric C. W. Verrone ’18 organized a reading for his play in the Leverett Library Theater, he had no idea that he would meet his future spouse, Jordan M. Villegas ’20, as a result.
“I went and saw it, because I heard about it from someone in one of my courses,” Villegas said. “Obviously being interested in LGBT history, the play kind of was about that… and I happened to sit next to the person who wrote it.” As the writer of the play, Verrone was eager for any feedback he could receive, and the two struck up a conversation after the reading ended.
Villegas had just started his freshman year of college, and Verrone was eager to help orient him to campus. “As a representative of the BGLTQ office, I feel like I started like, talking resources at [him],” he laughed. “And then, yeah, we just exchanged numbers.”
Texting turned into a first date at Berryline on a Tuesday night soon after.
The two dated through the rest of college, with Verrone concentrating in Psychology with a secondary in Women and Gender Studies, and Villegas joint-concentrating in Anthropology and Women and Gender Studies with a secondary in Latinx studies. After Verrone graduated in 2018, he found a job working as a public programs assistant putting on events at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design. The couple lived together in Brighton, Mass. while Villegas finished up his final year at the college.
In the summer of 2019, the couple began to discuss marriage. They picked out rings together online. “We decided that I was going to propose first,” Verrone said. “The ball was kind of in my court.” He ordered the rings and hid them from Villegas in their shared apartment until the fall.
The couple planned to spend Thanksgiving with Verrone’s family in Northern California, but flew out early to spend time in Pacific Grove, Calif. a seaside town in Monterey County. They were still on East Coast time and consistently woke up early. One morning, they decided to walk down to the beach and watch the sunrise. That’s when Verrone proposed.
“It was on my birthday, November 26, which is always right around Thanksgiving,” Villegas said. “And it just so happened that the place where he ended up proposing is called Lover’s Point.” The couple spent the rest of the day walking down the beach together.
When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, they were just beginning to tentatively look at wedding venues for the summer of 2021. “It meant that we hadn’t really gotten that far in the planning,” Verrone said. “And so now we’ve just sort of been like, ‘we’ll wait and see.’” They hope to plan a ceremony around Pacific Grove, where Verrone proposed, but with family in Houston, Texas and across California, they’ll wait to lock plans down until travel becomes safe.
The couple intends to move to New York City in the fall, where Villegas will begin a Ph.D. in history at Columbia University, but until then, they’ll remain hunkered down with Villegas’s family in Cicero, N.Y., baking plenty of bread.

Class of 2020,
Here we are … and aren’t.
From the beginning of our time at Harvard, we anticipated the day our achievements would be honored in the liveliness of Tercentenary Theater — with waves of pride and joy amidst the hues of crimson, funny-looking top hats, and the unification of our two worlds: our families and friends.
In reality, this day — the day we officially become Harvard graduates — is as removed from the norm as we are from each other. Two months ago, we faced the harsh reality that we wouldn’t spend the culminating months with friends in-person, having our post-thesis fun, and if nothing else, simply existing on the campus we have come to call home. While we have all responded to this grief differently, today we feel a mutual sense of despondency over what the current state of the world has taken from us.
This feeling of discouragement is valid. Indeed, we believe that today, we must allow ourselves to feel the way that we feel. At the same time, it is essential that we understand that this day is still special. That we are doing what so many of us deemed unimaginable just a few years ago is immutable. Today, we are graduating from Harvard.
In reflecting on the past 3.75 years, we realize there is much to be proud of. We’ve been through a lot together, Class of 2020. Our journey began when we walked through the gates of Harvard and stood in the Yard in wonder, realizing that we found our new home. We shared memories of our pasts and aspirations for our future with strangers and, by happenstance, some of them became our closest friends. Together, we settled in.
Then, things changed. With the unprecedented 2016 presidential election, many of us were ignited with shock. We quickly grasped the understanding that our worlds deviated from our expectations. And in this state of uncertainty and disorder, we sought refuge within Harvard’s gates and became grateful to have each other.
As we moved forward and further ingrained ourselves into campus life, we realized that uncertainty would follow us. We declared (and re-declared) our concentrations. We joined and got rejected from extracurriculars, internships, and even classes, leaving us in a state of self-doubt. Even in our final year, we constantly assessed (and re-assessed) who we were academically, socially, and later on, professionally.
Throughout these years, many of us hoped that Harvard would be a panacea for the myriad of unforeseeable obstacles. We liked to think that after four years, we would get inspired (and maybe learn how to code) and walk away with the rest of our lives all figured out. Indeed, we were often granted opportunities that allowed us to choose comfort and prestige in the face of uncertainty.
But comfort feels more elusive than ever. Today, we find that uncertainty permeates our everyday lives so drastically that it has forced us away from our lives at Harvard back to where we were before Harvard. It’s been jarring, upsetting, and simply put, wrong.
But it isn’t meaningless.
For the first time in years, we have been pushed to understand who we are outside of Harvard. And this has taught us a lot. In particular, it has made the two of us confront our fixation on productivity and reconnect with the things we truly love to do. More importantly, it has driven us to be intentional about what we really care about.
For all of us, this period has pushed us to distinguish between what makes us comfortable and what makes us fulfilled. With this, Class of 2020, we hope that you lean into that feeling of uncertainty. That feeling is precisely what makes us who we are. Uncertainty motivates us to take risks, embrace the present, and ask ourselves what really matters, guiding us back to our passions and pursuits that brought us to Harvard in the first place. Having completed our undergraduate years, we now have the tools and education to solve the greatest challenges of this ever-changing world.
But embracing uncertainty will not be easy, especially now. In an economy and world that entices us to avoid risk, it’s tempting to choose the safer route. If — and inevitably, when — this is the case, may we remember that we have had years of experience questioning ourselves and our world. Since the beginning of our time at Harvard, we’ve gotten a lot of preparation with being caught off guard and finding a way to carry on. And if there is one thing we’ve learned from this process, it’s that we can get through it together.
Our college experience is not defined by the current state of the world. The years we had on campus and the months we’ve spent together since then are not only irreplaceable, but also ongoing. We like to think that this lack of closure will make the future even brighter, and we hope that as a class we will use this experience to celebrate every moment that we do have: taking spontaneous trips (when safe) to see those we’ve missed, staying close with people we may not have otherwise, and rallying the masses to every reunion we hold, starting at our in-person commencement. Ultimately, we hope to hold Harvard in our hearts not as a thing of the past, but as a continuous part of our lives. And as your marshals, we promise to facilitate this by striving to make every moment we come back together even better than what would’ve been.
Tomorrow isn’t promised; we know this now more than ever before. Remember that even in this time dominated by uncertainty, every moment is worth embracing, because we’ve seen firsthand what happens when we wait. So for now, enjoy your moment of celebration for all that you have accomplished. As you watch the ceremonies from home and reconnect with the communities we are apart from, remember that this letter truly serves not as a goodbye but as a see you later. There has never been a class that has meant this the way we do. Harvard — and the sea of crimson flags, black regalia, and pomp and circumstance in the midst of laughter and tears — will always be in our hearts. Today of all days, we don’t want to let it go. Lucky for us, we don’t have to.
We’ll be back.
With love from afar,

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s graduate student union offered a “comprehensive compromise proposal” to the University in a virtual bargaining session Thursday afternoon, bargaining committee member Lee Kennedy-Shaffer wrote in an email update to members Saturday.
Kennedy-Shaffer wrote that the proposal includes compensation provisions Harvard and the union agree on. The offer guarantees a 2.8 percent raise to salaried student workers over the next year; an increase in minimum hourly pay rates; and funding increases for child care, health insurance for dependents, dental care, and co-payments. The final agreement would only last one year — a significant departure from earlier proposals prior to the coronavirus pandemic.
Harvard and HGSU-UAW have also agreed to key tentative contract provisions on workload, parking and transportation, as well as protections for research assistants and international students.
Despite this key breakthrough, the union and the University have yet to reach an agreement on discrimination and sexual harassment procedures, another central priority of HGSU-UAW.
“We are in active negotiations on Non-discrimination where, similarly, we are prioritizing key issues that will be the most crucial for a one-year agreement,” Kennedy-Shaffer wrote.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement that the University remains committed to reaching a final contract soon.
“Over the course of the last few mediation sessions, the two sides have made progress around key remaining issues and the University feels there is momentum for that progress to continue in the coming weeks,” Swain wrote.
Compensation specifically has been a crucial point of contention since the two sides first started bargaining. Though not yet signed, the compensation proposal signals a significant step in settling a final contract, as the two sides hope to have the contract take effect by July 1.
Kennedy-Shaffer wrote that even though the 2.8 percent raise was the University’s initial proposal in early March, the union considers the wage increase to be a success.
“Although this figure is less than we had initially bargained for, we are pleased to have won the university’s agreement on this increase,” Kennedy-Shaffer wrote.
He added HGSU-UAW’s bargaining team sees the salary increase provision as a direct result of the union’s sustained action since bargaining first began in October 2018.
“We believe that the university’s commitment to steady raises for graduate students during a time of unprecedented insecurity is a consequence of our consistent organizing, including our strike in December and our work in response to the pandemic this spring,” Kennedy-Shaffer wrote.
