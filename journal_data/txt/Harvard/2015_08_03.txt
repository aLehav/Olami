"This is good," I think to myself. "This is beautiful."
I’m standing on Weeks Bridge watching a scene develop. The water is roiling in scalloped confusion down below, and the leaves of the trees above me rustle, as if whispering in the language of friction, "Are you getting all of this?"
There is a woman down there on the well-trod earth, where the grass never takes in the shade. She’s old, with short white hair and the dolven eye sockets we tend to associate with soulless bodies, or beings out of which some real essence has fled. For the past few minutes she’s been describing the same wobbly circle in her motorized scooter, exasperatedly calling out in a tremulous, smoke-cured voice, “Bubsy! Bubsy!”
Every now and then she coughs.
There is a blue and yellow pennant projecting from the back of her scooter, because sometimes, I assume, she must go fast, and if the furious flapping of the pennant weren’t there to roughly gauge her speed, she might accelerate endlessly, becoming an engine self-propelled and self-contained, rocketing along the interstate highways in a blur of white and blue, eluding speed traps and police barricades and all citizen-led attempts to slow her down.
But there is Bubsy to think about—dreams of speed must go to rest. As I watch, she removes a long and slender cigarette from a pouch at her side and lights it. It remains on her lips as she calls out once more: “Bubsy!”
So long fascinated by this woman, I’d forgotten to look for Bubsy, but it’s not hard to spot him once I start. Down by the water, not thirty feet away and yet hidden from the woman’s sight by the river’s embankment, a small white dog with curly fur is lapping at the water. There’s an incredibly short leash in a half-coil at his side, so short that when the lead is in the woman’s hand he is probably forced to prance along in a state of near asphyxiation, and so we mustn’t chide poor Bubsy if he seizes freedom when it’s proffered.
I’m sorry to say that beyond the absurd humor of senseless repetition the scene from here on out doesn’t offer much. When he hears his name, Bubsy turns his head briefly, and then returns to lapping. The woman is still trapped in the same circle; ruts are beginning to form. She’s now alternating the enraged crack of “Bubsy!” with the blubbery bathos of “Bubsy,” hoping by any means to stir within her companion’s breast the reluctant pangs of fealty.
Just as I’m beginning to wonder how long this spectacle could possibly go on, I see that Bubsy, brimful, is returning to the woman. When he reaches her, they set off, she rolling, he trotting, no attempt made on the woman’s part to reclaim the leash. It must be there to satisfy the sanctimoniousness of others, because Bubsy, as the woman now remarks, is a good boy.
He always comes back.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As soon as the smell of the chocolate-colored elixir hits my nose, I am mesmerized. It is a process that never ceases to draw me in, from the way the mystical brown dust gently settles into a cream filter to the excitement of the metal kettle filled with steaming water. Even the most mundane acts come to life in new and unusual ways: When the water is finally released onto the crushed beans, a visual of an elephant spewing water from his long nose comes to mind. But despite the flights of fancy of my imagination, the pour itself is always careful and calculated; it is vital that the water reaches the whole surface area of the filter, from the outer rim to the center of the coffee dust. The pour over, as connoisseurs fittingly call it, is a technical, intentional process, designed to provide the most balanced brew.
As an avid coffee lover, the desire to discover the absolute best coffee has shaped my experience on the road this summer. My first pursuit upon arrival in a new city is always to find the prized local coffee shop—I have no choice but to answer the siren call of a cold brew in the midst of a tiring summer heat.
I had a magical experience in the great city of San Francisco a few days ago with one such local gem. Because my set was scheduled later than normal, I had the morning free to explore the city that is a coffee lover’s mecca—the home to acclaimed third wave roasters such as Sightglass Coffee and Ritual Coffee Roasters. Good coffee was bound to fall into my hands at some point.
On that morning, I decided to go to Walgreens first because I needed make-up. After all, I am an artist and image is everything. I found the pharmacy on Market Street and the make-up aisle—seemingly filled with a million different kinds of mascara and eyeshadow brands—followed right behind. I didn’t know where they came from or what material they were made out of or how there could even exist so many different kinds; but I did know that they all promised me the same thing—to improve my outer image.
I found what I thought I needed. The journey continued as I walked out of the pharmacy down Market Street, which was booming with loud laughing buses and screeching humans hustling to work. I decided to just see where this street would take me. Within four minutes, I had nitro-brewed, black nectar of the gods sitting delicately in my hand, with a beet and kale salad to maintain my health.
But even as I moved on from the coffee shop, walking around San Francisco with its rolling streets and rich architecture, surrounded by the buzz and the sounds of the City by the Bay, I could not shake one particular song stuck in my head—a song that I had heard every night for almost a month from Allen Stone. His lyrics flew from my lips and heart:
“Everyday I, piss money away, I'm a material slave
Just tryna polish this ball and this chain
Cause I, I don't think twice, just keep it out of my sight, oh
Bitch don't kill my vibe, no, bitch don't kill my vibe
American privilege, keeps blurring my vision, inherited sickness”
As I mouthed these lyrics, I felt guilty. I felt like a consumer. Going from cosmetics aisle to coffee shop, all I had done in the last hour was consume, buy, spend money on things I did not truly need when so many people in the world barely have access to clean water or own any clean clothes. I was spending money on artisan coffee and concealer to hide the tiniest dark circles under my eyes. I just bought and walked away without a second thought. It was a carefree manifestation of American privilege— a mindset that takes for granted the luxury of the average American lifestyle.
Of course, it is neither morally wrong to enjoy an excellently prepared coffee nor is it wrong to care about self-presentation. But there is a fine line between enjoyment and a kind of consumerism that disregards the reality of the pain and suffering in the world. Recognizing and being grateful for the privilege to waltz into a shop and have the choice between between an iced latte with almond milk and a lavender latte with coconut milk, or between kale salads versus arugula salads, is of utmost importance.
I don’t want to take our American privilege as a given without the awareness of what lies outside it. Having spent all my life in the US, whether at home or visiting many American cities this summer, I realize I am so often unaware, so often presumptuous that whenever I need something it will be there for me.
I think this privilege could be better managed and more appreciated. I don’t mean to say that Americans are all selfish wealthy narcissists; in fact, this is the exact opposite of what I am saying. All I know is that as a country we have a lot in comparison to other countries and for this we should be mindful, grateful, and responsible.
Nurturing that attitude of gratitude has to start small, with the individual actions of individual people—with me, with small acts of kindness, small efforts to take my mind outside of the coffee shop and cosmetic section. How can I use my resources for the benefit of others? Maybe it’s simply inviting a friend who needs a listening ear to the coffee shop, or creating an organization that celebrates natural beauty instead of promoting make-up as a mask, or helping a non-profit that provides people with clean clothing who otherwise might not have it.
All is not lost for people like me who are entrenched in American consumerism and privilege. When privilege is a gateway to good stewardship of wealth, then maybe it can be like steaming water, finding the balance for a delicious pour over brew.

You could call it a prank of presidential proportions.
Portraying themselves as their longtime rivals, Harvard Lampoon staffers tricked the Donald J. Trump campaign into thinking that The Crimson was endorsing the controversial candidate in his bid for the American presidency.
It all started earlier this summer, when the prized Crimson president’s chair went missing from the newspaper’s Cambridge, Mass., headquarters. Harvard lore dictates that staffers of the Lampoon—a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine—try to steal the chair, while Crimson editors seek to nab the large metal bird, called the Ibis or Thresky, that sits atop the roof of the humor publication’s property on Bow Street.
In late June, Crimson summer staffers returned to the newspaper building to find their storied chair missing from its second-story perch, according to Crimson president Steven S. Lee ’16. A casing for bolt cutters lay nearby; the chair had been chained to a wall to prevent it from being stolen.
Lee immediately suspected that ’Poonsters were behind the theft and contacted them to request that they return the chair. "They said they would get back to me on it,” Lee says.
A few weeks later, the chair made a very public appearance. An article, emblazoned with the headline “Crimson Endorses Trump for President” and signed “The Crimson Staff,” cropped up online, claiming to tout the newspaper’s support for the billionaire Republican primary candidate’s bid for the presidency in 2016. Among other points, it dubbed him “a celebrity above all” and “the most formidable and competitive candidate on the Republican side.” It also espoused his job creation record—specifically the supposed good work of “The Celebrity Apprentice,” a reality show Trump has hosted. The editorial reasoned that the show helped “inactive or troubled” celebrities regain their fame and thus created jobs.
"The creative methods and avenues through which Trump has created jobs would likely make (former Crimson editor-in-chief) Franklin D. Roosevelt ’03 smile,” the editorial read.
A photo of a grinning Trump, seated in The Crimson’s stately president’s chair and posing with two thumbs up, accompanied the article. In the photo, he is surrounded by a group of college-aged people, some dressed in matching ties, who a reader might presume are members of The Crimson’s editorial board. 
It’s quite a photo. Trump’s hair is perfectly coiffed.
Of course, The Crimson published no such article. Lee tells Flyby that the newspaper does not traditionally endorse a presidential candidate this far ahead of an election. (The editorial staff also tends to endorse Democrats.)
The culprit: ’Poonsters.
At least some Lampoon staffers, it appears, orchestrated the photo-op. Masquerading as The Crimson, some pranksters apparently informed Trump campaign officials that they planned to pen an editorial endorsing the business magnate-turned-Republican primary frontrunner on behalf of the paper, according to Lee.
While the Crimson president didn’t go so far as to outright accuse the Lampoon of the prank in an interview, he could identify some of the people in the photo as ’Poonsters, a fact Flyby independently verified. It looks like they transported The Crimson’s chair to Trump Tower in New York City and posed with the candidate, successful in their quest to dupe him and prank their rivals.
Lee says it appears that the pranksters “covered all their bases” in executing the stunt, with “good evidence” that they went so far as to correspond with the Trump campaign through an email address that purported to belong to a Crimson editor. They also created a copycat website to host the fake Crimson editorial. (A web domain identification site lists the domain, very similar to The Crimson's, as registered to the Harvard Lampoon and ’Poonster Daniel A. Citron ’16.)
The Crimson, for its part, was unaware of the plot until a Trump campaign representative contacted Lee about the editorial, which the imposters had apparently sent to the campaign pre-publication. Unfamiliar with the article, Lee realized that some individuals were likely posing as Crimson editors. He clarified to the campaign that no one had visited Trump Tower on behalf of the newspaper, nor authorized the editorial.
“They recognized the situation once we had chatted, and it seemed like they were going to take care of it, whatever that means,” Lee says.
The parody editorial went up online briefly in mid-July and then again a few days ago.
The Trump campaign declined to comment on-the-record for this post. But despite its glowing endorsement of the candidate, the parody article was not featured in the “In the News” section of the campaign’s website at the time of this post’s publication.
Lampoon president Calvin Willett ’16 did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
