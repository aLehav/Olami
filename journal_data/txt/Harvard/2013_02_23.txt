After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After serving as host of Cultural Rhythms, serenading the audience with snippets of her songs, and dancing with Harvard Bhangra, Artist of the Year Nicole Scherzinger sat down and talked with Flyby before rushing off to catch a plane to London.
Flyby: What was your impression of the day?
Nicole Scherzinger: I walked into this thing not sure what to expect. I have never gotten an award like this. I didn't know I'd end up hosting. I was just blown away by the diversity. It was so inspiring. I got ideas for my own music, for my own tour. I had a blast here.
Flyby: For all those women who admire you and think you're absolutely beautiful, what is your message to them?
NS: As women, we tend to be hard on ourselves. [My message is] through your vision, stay true to yourself. Don’t compromise yourself. Stay strong. Especially at Harvard, through education. It’s amazing that Harvard has a woman President and a woman Dean [of the College]. I always want to empower women through music.
Flyby: Do you have any hidden talents? Any random things you enjoy doing?
NS: Impressions. I have fun doing impressions of other singers and other people. And being an Aunt. I love being an Aunt.
Flyby: What inspires you the most?
NS: Love. The passion to never give up. To seek out my true purpose.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Saturday morning report of a gunman at MIT that prompted a campus-wide lockdown was a hoax, authorities said.
The Cambridge Police Department said it received a report at approximately 7:28 a.m. that a man was inside a building in the Main Group complex on MIT’s campus with a gun. The gunman was reported to have a “long rifle and body armour,” according to an MIT emergency alert message.
CPD officers reached the scene at 7:30 a.m., secured the area, and searched the buildings thoroughly, room-by-room. MIT sent out an emergency message telling students to stay indoors or seek shelter at about 8:45 a.m. But when CPD’s hunt yielded no results, the lockdown was called off at 10:45 a.m.
In a statement released shortly after 12:30 p.m., CPD spokesperson Daniel M. Riviello wrote, “No armed suspects were found in the building or on campus, and police believe that the event, as reported, did not occur.”
The Main Group, which rests at the center of MIT’s campus, comprises a group of facilities under 77 Massachusetts Ave., MIT’s flagship mailing address.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sporting a Harvard sweatshirt over a black and white dress, singer Nicole Scherzinger accepted the 2013 Artist of the Year Award before a lively audience at the matinee show of the 28th annual Cultural Rhythms festival Saturday afternoon.
Scherzinger, the former lead singer of the Pussycat Dolls, was honored by the Harvard Foundation as part of a day of festivities—including a luncheon, a food festival, and an evening show of student performances—all celebrating cultural diversity on campus.
Scherzinger, who is of Hawaiian, Filipino, and Russian descent and grew up in Kentucky, is the first person of Asian-American heritage to receive the award. In her acceptance speech, she called the honor “an affirmation that at least I’m on the right path.”
Throughout the show, Scherzinger embraced the spirit of the day. After the Harvard Philippine Forum’s performance, she sang “Happy Birthday” to one of the students dancers—in Italian.
“It’s amazing how people from all different backgrounds can take part,” said Scherzinger. “That would explain why I saw the Asian people in the mariachi band earlier. It was beautiful.”
Cracking jokes between acts, Scherzinger also engaged the audience with her sharp and self-deprecating humor. At one point, she posed for a selfie with one of the Irish step dancers.
Scherzinger was introduced at the show by honorary host United States Treasurer Rosa G. Rios ’87, who co-founded Cultural Rhythms as an undergraduate.
“Culture is about experiencing life,” said Rios, returning to the same stage where she once performed. Rios recited a list of Scherzinger’s diverse achievements and contributions, including her performance of “The Phantom of the Opera” for the Queen of England and her philanthropic work to fight human trafficking and breast cancer.
Scherzinger was joined on stage by a number of student groups who performed at the show. Nearly all of them gave Scherzinger a rose at the conclusion of their acts.
First up was the Harvard College Pan-African Dance and Music Ensemble, featuring fast drumming and barefoot dancers. The group was followed by the Mariachi Veritas de Harvard, who played traditional music on guitars and violins.
“How does it feel to be so smart and talented?” Scherzinger asked two of the Mariachi Veritas performers. “I’m starting to feel like an underachiever here.”
Then came Harvard Wushu, who combined martial arts and dance in a traditional Chinese performance. The performers twirled fake swords just inches away from Scherzinger’s face.
Later in the show, Scherzinger got up to dance in her black pumps alongside the Harvard Breakers during their breakdancing routine.
The finale featured an ensemble of performers from every group dancing along to “When I Grow Up” by the Pussycat Dolls. Without hesitation, Scherzinger took the microphone and sang on top of her own vocals.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It seemed as though a game that the Harvard women’s basketball team had once led by double digits was slipping away, when Brown guard Sheila Dixon grabbed an offensive board off of a missed three and sunk a trey to whittle the lead down to two.
But junior guard Christine Clark had other ideas. In the final 30 seconds, Clark went five-for-six from the line to defend the Crimson’s home territory, a court on which Harvard (15-8, 6-3 Ivy) has yet to lose this season.
Sharp shooting from senior forward Victoria Lippert and clutch rebounding down the stretch on Friday night prevented the Bears (8-16, 2-8) from snatching the Crimson’s 77-71 victory, despite Brown’s best efforts to pull out an upset.
“I thought that it was a great team win at the end, we really came together,” Clark said. “People started taking care of the ball, we started getting defensive stops when we needed to, and it shouldn’t have been that close, but I’m glad that we pulled out the win.”
Lippert notched the first four points for Harvard and never looked back. The senior tallied 14 points in the first half alone and finished with a season-high 24 points on 10-for-20 shooting, including three from behind the arc, putting her in second place in Harvard history for career three-pointers made behind Erin Maher ’93.
“[Lippert is] one of the most tried-and-true consistent players,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said.  “She’s playing like a senior, she’s playing like a senior star, and where maybe she was an offensive player throughout her career, I think her defense and rebounding have evolved to match her offense this year.”
After entering halftime with the score knotted at 37, the Crimson wasted no time in putting space between itself and the Bears. Lippert stole the ball on Brown’s first possession and drove it down the court to give Harvard its first lead since the 4:11 mark in the first half.
A few minutes and two three-pointers from the senior later, Harvard pushed its lead to 12, but turnovers on missed passes and fouls cut the advantage down, as the Crimson surpassed the foul limit with nearly six minutes to play.
“We underperformed,” Delaney-Smith said. “I can’t get this team to put together a whole game to their capabilities and I haven’t had a better team in practice. I think this team does a great job in practice, I don’t understand why we can’t do the same things in a game. I respect their work, but we make mistakes in games, and in every game, there seems to be something slightly different. I’m always slightly caught off-guard by what’s going to show up.”
Bears guard Sophie Bikofsky led Brown’s multi-faceted attack, which featured four different players in double figures, putting up 19 points against a team that she once considered joining.
“They’re all dangerous,” Delaney-Smith said. “They have a kid from Newton that wanted to come here, and that’s Sophie Bikofsky, who had a great game, did a terrific job…. I expected Brown to [play this well], but I expected us to play better.”
The Bears jumped out to a quick 8-4 lead, but Harvard kept pace with Brown, trading jumpers, and the margin between the teams never surpassed four points in the first half. Although the Crimson pulled down nearly three times as many boards as the visiting team and held a 12-0 second-chance point advantage, the team coughed the ball up 11 times to a stingy Bears defense, preventing any substantial lead from forming.
“I think that Brown—wherever we play them—it’s always a challenge,” Clark said. “They come in with a very strong underdog attitude, and so they really play like they have nothing to lose. This is actually the first time, in my time here, that we’ve swept them in Ivy League play.”
Both teams rained in shots from downtown, with the Bears attempting treys 18 times and the Crimson tossing up 25 attempts, tying its most for the season, a product of Brown’s interior defense.
“They literally said that they did not want to defend any of our forwards in the paint, particularly [sophomore forward] Temi [Fagbenle], so if you looked at them, they had sagging man-to-man defense,” Delaney-Smith said. “I think there was a zone occasionally, but it was all in the paint, so they gave us threes, 15-footers, 18-footers, and that’s not a bad shot for us.”
Fagbenle and Clark joined Lippert in double figures for the Crimson, putting up 17 and 16 points, respectively.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PROVIDENCE, R.I.—At times, the Harvard men’s basketball team’s performance on Friday night seemed to leave the door open for a potential upset that would have shaken up the Ivy  League standings.
But just as soon as Brown had capitalized on a Crimson dry spell to cut its deficit to six in the second half, the Bears’ self-destructive play prevented them from making things more interesting.
The crowd at the Pizzitola Sports Center in Providence, R.I., which had been mostly indifferent to the first 30 minutes of action, began to wake up as the home team put together a 12-3 run, turning what had threatened to be a blowout into a 39-33 game and calling to mind Brown’s furious comeback in Cambridge earlier this season.
From that point, the Bears’ momentum was effectively stopped by two missed free throws, two missed three-pointers, and a turnover, and Harvard (17-7, 9-1 Ivy) was able to once more steadily increase its advantage. It was the closest the Crimson would allow the Bears (10-14, 4-6) to get, finishing them off by a final tally of 65-47.
Though Harvard had an uncharacteristically poor shooting night, converting on only two of its 12 attempts from beyond the arc and 21 of 37 trips to the free throw line, it wasn’t going to take a superhuman effort to defeat a team that was having as many difficulties putting the ball in the hoop as Brown was.
The Bears were 1-for-14 from three-point range and shot just 37.2 percent from the field as a team. Combined with 19 turnovers—compared to six for the Crimson—Brown gave itself virtually no chance to take down heavily-favored Harvard, which, to its credit, defended the Bears tightly throughout the game.
“I thought our defense against the three-point line was one of the more credible things we were trying to accomplish tonight,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “Certainly, they missed a ton, as we did, from the three-point line.”
SUPER SAUNDERS
Once again, the Crimson offense was powered by Saunders, who submitted another performance to put him at the forefront of the Ivy Player of the Year discussion. Saunders finished with 19 points on 7-of-11 shooting, but it was his nine rebounds that most impressed his coach.
“I was very, very impressed with [his rebound total] because we’ve been on him about getting on the glass,” Amaker said. “That’s a big number for a wing player.”
Saunders’ night could have been even bigger had he been more efficient from the free throw line. Despite getting to the charity stripe 13 times, Saunders hit only five of his attempts, much to the delight of the Bears’ student section. However, he was able to quiet the jeering fans with a fast-break dunk that put the Crimson up 11 points with 8:40 remaining, putting an end to Brown’s comeback attempt.
GOING SMALL
Harvard played almost the entirety of Friday’s game with a four-guard lineup, as Saunders, Rivard, freshman Siyani Chambers, and captain Christian Webster all played at least 37 of the game’s 40 minutes.
Some of this was out of necessity—foul trouble plagued the Crimson bigs throughout the game. Coming off of his Ivy Player of the Week performance, sophomore Kenyatta Smith got the start ahead of sophomore Jonah Travis.
But Smith was on the court for only six minutes in the first half after picking up two quick fouls. The second half was a similar story, with Smith being whistled twice more in eight minutes and having to sit for the rest of the contest.
“He is a shot blocker, and he’s done that very well, but you need to still play defense and play before your man gets [the ball],” Amaker said. “I think sometimes as a great shot blocker you play behind, and Kenyatta was giving up too much post position.”
Sophomore Steve Moundou-Missi, Harvard’s first big man off the bench, also finished the game with four fouls.
After being a mainstay in the starting lineup for most of the season, Travis has seen his minutes cut drastically in the last week.
Travis was on the court for 11 total minutes in last weekend’s games against Penn and Princeton. Even with his teammates’ foul trouble, he received just 10 minutes against the Bears, finishing with three points and three rebounds.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW HAVEN, Conn.—Much like in November, when the two football programs met at Harvard Stadium, the Harvard and Yale men’s basketball Saturday matchup—a 72-66 Crimson victory—was a heated affair from start to finish.
It started from the tip, with ringing chants of “Harvard sucks” echoing throughout the gymnasium. It continued into the second half, when Bulldog Austin Morgan knocked down a three to tie the game and mimicked junior co-captain Laurent Rivard’s celebration on his way up the court. It peaked with Javier Duren’s late flagrant foul on freshman guard Siyani Chambers, a push with four seconds left that sent Chambers careening into the Bulldog bench.
“We will get a chance to honestly evaluate it better as we watch the film but I thought we were tough when we needed to be,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “Certainly we did some things we didn’t do against Brown, and I was very pleased with that. I think there are a lot of things we carried from the last game that we didn’t do well and fixed them.”
After frontcourt teammates and sophomore forwards Steve Moundou-Missi and Kenyatta Smith carried the Crimson (17-7, 9-1 Ivy) in double-digit wins over Penn and Princeton the weekend before, it was the guards’ turn to shoulder much of the load against Yale (11-16, 5-5 Ivy).
Although Moundou-Missi scored 17 points on six-of-seven shooting, the four Harvard guards—Chambers, Rivard, sophomore Wesley Saunders, and co-captain Christian Webster—combined for 51 of the team’s 72 points. Amaker said that the Bulldogs were able to throw Smith off his game with more physical play.
“We want to go inside,” Amaker said. “We want to play inside out, and we didn’t get a lot from it but we are trying to see if we can get the ball in the paint from dribble or by pass for Kenyatta because he is aggressive on the interior. Knowing he has been a force for our team, they played very physical and very hard and made it very difficult for him to maneuver and to get shots.”
Rivard shook off a 0-of-7 night from the field on Friday against Brown to make three treys Saturday, combining with Webster to knock down five in the second half from beyond the arc. Chambers contributed seven assists along with 14 points, hitting two free throws in the final 90 seconds to help seal the deal.
“It’s always exciting to play in that kind of environment,” Moundou-Missi said. “That’s what you want as a college basketball player. I think we got better today and we are taking a step forward to what we can become as a team. It showed our mental toughness and we battled through the game.”
In the first half, the Crimson struggled from deep, making one of seven, but Saunders poured in 12 points to keep Harvard narrowly ahead of its rival at the break.
After carrying a 34-28 lead into halftime, the Crimson extended the lead to seven on a Rivard three with 16 minutes left to play.
But Duren and Bulldog forward Justin Sears went on their own 9-0 run, putting Yale up two with 13 minutes to go. After the Bulldogs extended the lead to six, Harvard mounted a 7-0 run on two Chambers assists and an and-one to take a 58-57 lead it would never relinquish.
“It’s always tough against them,” Moundou-Missi said. “You have to give them credit for their toughness, but you need to battle through it, and that’s what has us in first. It was a good game, and [while] I wouldn’t call it a statement, it is a great win for us.”
The Bulldogs began the game on a hot streak, scoring on four of their first seven possessions to take a 9-5 lead at the under-sixteen timeout.
But after the timeout, Saunders scored 10 of the Crimson’s next 13 points to help Harvard take an 18-13 lead. His high-rising dunk over two Yale defenders—extending his arm to slam the ball home even as he fell to the hardwood—energized the Crimson faithful, but Saunders did not score in the last nine minutes as Harvard fell cold from the field.
The Crimson has now won four in a row, sweeping Penn and Princeton last weekend for only the second time in eight tries and defeating Brown and Yale on the road over the weekend to maintain the 1.5-game lead over the Princeton Tigers.

When you got into Harvard, you probably thought that you had escaped rejection forever. Not so fast. You may be among the best and the brightest—but so is everyone else. Everyone wants to apply to everything, and so rejection from student organizations—whether it's an a Capella group or the Asian-American Brotherhood—seems inevitable. After all, they can't take everyone.
 This phenomenon of rejection seems to be even more prevalent this year. With applications to the College at a record high, more high school seniors will face rejection from Harvard this year than ever before.
On campus, while the number of new members accepted by student groups has remained relatively constant, the number of applicants, auditionees, and compers has shot up. 
FOP (the Freshmen Outdoor Program) tends to accept around forty new leader applicants each year. Yet, even with a 33 percent increase in applications, they simply didn't have the space to take more new leaders, having to turn away many qualified applicants.
These application jumps are difficult for both sides of the application process. "We had a huge rise in applications this year, which made decisions much, much harder," said FOP Steering Committee member Grace L. Chen '15, who is an inactive Crimson photo editor.
Ben L. Donald '15, president of the Harvard Opportunes, a co-ed a cappella ensemble, said that 25 percent more students auditioned this fall than last fall, yet there was no increase in the size of the group.
This trend also rang true with DAPA (Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors), who actually reduced the number of new members that they accepted this year.
"Communication and attendance is key to making DAPA's endeavors successful, and because of this, we aim to keep our membership at a certain intimate level," said Kendall L. Sherman '15, a member of DAPA's selection committee.
Why the sudden jump in applications? We at Flyby do not have a straightforward answer. We just want to keep you informed as you start getting nervous for your upcoming interviews, auditions, and socials. Good luck!

The class of 2016 was whisked away for an evening in Hollywood last night, proving once and for all that class is just a bowtie away.
We were overwhelmed by the A-list quality of the meal, which culminated in a chocolate layer cake that would have had Dame Helen Mirren and Natalie Portman '03 in a fistfight—directed by Quentin Tarantino—for a space at the buffet. Diners were serenaded with the melodious warbling of "We Found Love" by what could easily have been Rihanna herself, but we were distracted by the bravery of those who dazzled in jewel-encrusted ball gowns on the equally crusty Annenberg floorboards.
The paparazzi were conspicuous in their absence as the glittering Silver Line buses pulled up, affording party-goers a scenic walk to the Westin Hotel. There, the Class of '16 rubbed elbows with the great and the good and what looked like a convention of a biker gang called the Renegade Pigs. The red carpet was rolled out and the ballroom was packed with the big names of the Harvard stage, field, and dorm, all of whom partied until the wee hours.
After an evening of glamour unparalleled by any other event in the Freshman social calendar—even the star-studded First Chance Dance—the magic of the night was concluded by a 45-minute wait for the coat check. They'd never have put President Lincoln—Mr. Day-Lewis, sorry—through this.
