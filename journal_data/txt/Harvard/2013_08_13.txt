After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A former interim Senator, a former U.S. Labor Secretary, and a former Los Angeles mayor will highlight the Institute of Politics’ fall roster of residential and visiting fellows, which was announced Monday.
William “Mo” Cowan, the Democrat who represented Massachusetts in the U.S. Senate for several months this year after John Kerry vacated his seat to become U.S. Secretary of State, will host a weekly study group for students and members of the Harvard community as one of the Institute’s six residential fellows this fall.
Hilda L. Solis, who served as U.S. Labor Secretary from 2009-2013, and Antonio Villaraigosa, who served two terms as mayor of Los Angeles, will each spend several days at Harvard this fall as visiting fellows.
“It’s a great group of fellows with a lot of different experiences,” IOP Director C. M. Trey Grayson ’94 said in a phone interview Monday. “It’s a well-timed class with a range of backgrounds.”
Among others, Grayson highlighted the technological background of residential fellow Ginny Hunt, who works in civic innovation and strategy at Google
Rounding out the roster of residential fellows are four other prominent faces in journalism, government, and politics. They include Sasha Issenberg, a political journalist; Karen Gordon Mills ’75, who recently announced her resignation as administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration and has previously served on the University’s Board of Overseers; Beth Myers, who served as Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign manager in 2008 and as an adviser to his campaign in 2012; and Ana Navarro, a political commentator on CNN and CNN en Español who served as the national Hispanic co-chair of Jon Huntsman’s 2012 presidential campaign.
Issenberg, a columnist for Slate who also covered the 2008 presidential election in The Boston Globe’s Washington bureau, said in a phone interview Monday that he hopes to use his time at the IOP to show students more about the science and infrastructure behind campaigns. Issenberg said he will bring in practitioners from the campaign trail as guests for his study group.
“What I hope I’ll be able to do, and with the help of people who have been inside campaigns as guests in my study group, is to show people who may have seen campaigns from one perspective...see the whole body of knowledge that sits behind that and understand how the tactics that they saw were developed,” Issenberg said.
In addition, Grayson said he is excited about the perspectives that this semester’s three Hispanic fellows—Navarro, Solis, and Villaraigosa—will bring to the IOP. Navarro expressed similar enthusiasm in a phone interview Monday.
“It’s important to have more diversity in politics and in academia,” Navarro said. “I look forward to the opportunity of bringing the perspective as an immigrant and Hispanic growing up in the United States and working in politics.”
As in past years, at least one of this semester’s fellows will balance her commitments at the IOP with other professional obligations. As a fellow, Navarro will continue her CNN commentary by working from a studio at the Kennedy School and sometimes returning to Washington, Grayson said.
“It will be neat to have her doing that commentary and then go back to her study group,” Grayson said. “That’ll be kind of special.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The University has finalized the sale of its property at 2 Mt. Auburn St. to nonprofit Homeowner’s Rehab, Inc., ending several months of uncertainty about the future of Putnam Square Apartments, a 94-unit affordable senior housing complex at the site. The deal will preserve affordable housing at the residences for at least 30 years.
All residents are eligible to stay in their current units and rent will continue to be calculated as it was before the sale, according to a letter sent to residents dated Aug. 5. The letter was signed by  Thomas J. Lucey, Harvard’s Cambridge director of government relations; Peter Daly, executive director of Homeowner’s Rehab; and John Van Saun, president of the 2 Mt. Auburn Street Tenants Association.
Several improvements are planned for the property, which was valued at $12.8 million in 2013 by the City of Cambridge. The construction will begin “very soon” after the property transfer, according to the letter. There are plans to start work on elevators in the fall and to install new boilers in time for the upcoming winter.
“The building, which Harvard has maintained as affordable housing for seniors for more than 40 years, was a unique property among Harvard’s buildings,” a Harvard spokesperson wrote in an emailed statement this past Friday. “All of the parties involved—residents of the building, City and State government, Harvard, and HRI—share the commitment to preserve the property as affordable for the long term.”
Last fall the University announced its plans to sell the 2 Mt. Auburn property. In March, Harvard entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Homeowner’s Rehab, though the sale was not finalized until recently.
The level of communication between the University and community officials during negotiations prompted concern from the Cambridge City Council, which voted at its meeting at the end of July to request that the City Manager set up a committee “to open up truthful communication” with Harvard about its plans for the property.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A newly created student council will convene in the fall to advise the Office of BGLTQ Student Life and the College more broadly on issues concerning Harvard’s bisexual, gay, lesbian, transgender, and queer community.
The Queer Advisory Council, or QuAC, will be made up of 13 voting undergraduate members drawn from BGLTQ-identified student groups and the College community at large.
The Council was created in line with the Office of BGLTQ Student Life’s goal of helping make sure that the Office is “keeping our finger on the pulse on what it is that’s actually going on with students,” according to Kevin D. Tervala, a graduate intern for BGLTQ student life who will advise the Council.
In addition to its advising role, the Council will award grants to student groups looking to host events related to the BGLTQ community. The grants will be funded by the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, Tervala said, although the specific monetary amounts are still “a little bit up in the air.”
The Council’s meetings, which will be open to any interested Harvard affiliates, will also aim to serve as a space for discussion among student leaders and members of the BGLTQ community. Tervala said he hopes the Council will meet at least once a month.
Tervala called the Council a “student-driven effort,” and said that students will guide the group’s direction when it convenes in the fall. He predicted that the Council will likely in part become a space for students to discuss College policies, such as gender-neutral housing. Such discussion, he added, will help inform Director of BGLTQ Student Life Van Bailey of students’ opinions. Bailey was unavailable for comment Tuesday.
The eight BGLTQ-identified student groups that will each send one representative to sit on the Council include the queer Jewish organization BAGELS; the peer counseling group Contact; GirlSpot; Gay, Lesbian, or Whatever (GLOW); Harvard College Munch; the Queer Resource Center; Harvard Queer Students and Allies; and the Trans Task Force. Five additional “at-large” members will be chosen in September from a pool of applicants from the undergraduate community as a whole.
Tervala expressed enthusiasm for the Council’s potential to positively impact the BGLTQ community in the upcoming semester. 
“It’s such a wonderful opportunity,” Tervala said, “and I think it will serve as such as a phenomenal resource, not only as a source of money for people, but I think more importantly as just another space where people can come together and talk through issues as a group.”

Apparently having the largest endowment in higher education isn’t good enough to be named the most fiscally healthy college in the country by the always-reliable Forbes magazine.
 
Though Forbes gave Harvard a perfect ‘A+’ grade for fiscal soundness, the magazine ranked the University a mysterious fifth on its list of America’s “Most Financially Fit Colleges.”
 
Forbes seems to have deemed four schools more financially fit than Harvard for, as far as we can see, no reason at all—though we’re not terribly surprised considering that Harvard was inexplicably shunned to eighth place on Forbes’s list of America’s top colleges.
 
In the fiscal health rankings, published online last month and in print this week, Forbes evaluated more than 900 private, not-for-profit colleges and universities based on data from the 2010 and 2011 fiscal years. Forbes graded each school on nine variables, ranging from operating surplus to admissions yield, to assess their balance sheet health, operational soundness, and overall fiscal health.
 
Based on these scores, schools were accordingly assigned letter grades and GPAs, with the top 41 schools on the list all receiving ‘A+’ grades and GPAs of 4.5. Grade inflation, it seems, runs rampant even in college rankings.
So what makes Harvard less financially fit than Princeton (#1), Pomona (#2), Swarthmore (#3),and Columbia (#4), you ask? We have the same question. We tweeted at the Forbes editor who compiled the list to ask for more information, but we haven’t heard back.
