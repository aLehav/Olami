The K-pop boy band BTS released “Film Out,” the lead single for their upcoming Japanese compilation album “BTS, The Best,” on April 2. BTS announced the song was the main theme of the soundtrack for the Japanese film “Signal: Long-Term Unsolved Case Investigation Team,” continuing BTS’s long tradition of lending their voices to Japanese movies and TV series. Lead vocalist Jungkook worked closely with J-pop group Back Number to produce “Film Out,” and that powerful collaboration resulted in an unprecedented style of ballad for BTS.
In an interview with Billboard, BTS said that the melody and lyrics have “the power to touch many people’s hearts.” Indeed, the song’s impact lies precisely in the combination of the two, since the production’s complexity narrates the intricate story behind the lyrics.
The song begins with a simple piano chord progression whose minor keys set a melancholy mood for the introduction. The threadbare sonics seemingly fade into the background as Jungkook’s clear voice fills the silence. Likewise, that very same dynamic is expressed in the lyrics: “You, in my imagination” regresses into “You suddenly disappear” as Jimin sings about the emptiness of love’s illusions. The tempo suddenly rises and transitions the song into the chorus, which beautifully contrasts Jungkook’s higher tone with V’s lower register. “I feel you with every burst of pain,” V concludes the chorus, just as a suspenseful rest pierces the song’s ambience as well. The rap line (RM, Suga, and J-Hope) join the vocal line (Jin, Jimin, Jungkook, and V) in a series of ad libs that split the dulcet chorus from the metrical rap verse, effectively differentiating the melody from the rhythm.
The mellow instrumentals fade and give way to a steady tempo just as RM’s rap verse kicks in. The cadence of his punchy bars dilute the melancholy ballad with interrupted phrases like “no light, or water,” and “rootless, leafless.” That caesura is also present in his flow, seeing as he often pauses for air in between two consecutive words, echoing the way his lyrics chunk into arbitrary phrases. Another chorus skillfully acts as a buffer between RM’s lines and the next rap verse, delivered by Suga and J-Hope, as Jin’s higher range starkly contrasts with the rappers’ lower registers. “The way you are / Kind hearted, always smiling, but…” Suga calls out to J-Hope, who responds with “If tears can be measured, it took this long.” These rappers’ flow is more fluid, not halting even when Suga hands over the mic to J-Hope in the middle of the phrase, highlighting the continuous flexibility of the verses.
That unification of lyrics and flow carries over into the acoustics for the rest of the song.
Once again, an intervening chorus follows the rappers and transitions the song into the bridge. The soulful guitar tracks — contributed by Back Number’s Iyori Shimizu — harmonize with Jin’s high-pitched ad libs as he builds up the first part of the bridge. “The fragrance I smell, the warmth I feel,” Jimin concludes in the second half of the bridge, reflecting the desire to hold on to the visceral memory of love for “As long as it lasts.” These lyrics are very sorrowful, painting vivid images of the pain of remembering a lost love. There is a disunion of mind and body in the lyrics; Those fragments of memories that cause the illusion of a lover’s presence come into conflict with what is real and what isn’t. Likewise, the song crescendos with that heart-wrenching buildup coming to a climax with a dissonance of symphonic violins and guitar chords, giving the illusion of cacophony.
The track descends into its finale accompanied by a hint of guitar, but otherwise the outro is devoid of all sound. It ends just like it began — highlighting the singers’ voices and deemphasizing the soft and breathy background instrumentals — an approach that also reveals some hidden back vocals in the process. That complex and full-circle arc makes for an emotional catharsis that brings the narrative intensification of the lyrics to life. By stepping outside of their comfort zone and getting involved with the creative process of songwriting, BTS brought that powerful combination of melody and lyrics to fruition, giving their vocal prowess a chance to truly shine.

After certified Hot Girl Megan Thee Stallion announced her relationship with rapper Pardison Fontaine, the attitude, energy, and hustle of 2019’s Hot Girl Summer seemed a distant memory. But according to Chet Hanks, a rapper, actor, and the eccentric son of actor Tom Hanks, 2021 will usher in a new age — a White Boy Summer.
In a March 26 Instagram video, Hanks informed his nearly 500k followers,“This summer is about to be a White Boy Summer.” Careful to delineate the movement from any negative or militant connotations, he quickly reassured listeners of exactly what type of white boy he was referring to: “I’m not talking about a Trump, NASCAR type white,” Hanks said, but rather “real vanilla kings,” like musicians Jack Harlow, Jon B., and himself.
As expected, Twitter users quickly responded with memes ranging from premonitions of White Boy Summer to questions of how Chet Hanks became — well — Chet Hanks. The product of two famous white parents, Hanks’s bizarre fixation on redefining whiteness, frequent use of African American Vernacular English (or AAVE), and odd social media presence — as evidenced in the original White Boy Summer announcement — continue to make him an enigma. As one user tweeted, “Chet hanks is exactly what suburban parents in 2007 thought would happen to their children if they let them listen to like half a lil wayne song.”
Following his movement’s viral popularity, Hanks has since launched merchandise featuring the insignias “White Boy Summer” and “Black Queen Summer” and has recorded both a song and music video for release in the upcoming week.
While most users found the prospect of #WBS amusing, there remained valid criticisms of the trend’s connotation, as well as of Hanks himself. Some users pointed out the problematic nature of Hanks appropriating the term “Hot Girl Summer,” (coined by Meg Thee Stallion — a Black woman) as a means of unnecessarily elevating white men. Given 2020’s amplification of the Black Lives Matter Movement, it seems inappropriate to return white men to the center of the narrative. Throughout the past few years alone, general hate crimes in the United States have reached the highest levels in over a decade and Anti-Asian hate crimes have surged by 145% since 2019. In a society which consistently prioritizes the needs and desires of white men above those in marginalized communities, what is abnormal about White Boy Summer? Isn’t every day already catered towards white men?
These criticisms continue to gain further traction as past controversial actions by the junior Hanks resurface. From Hanks defending his usage of the N-word during his early rap days and speaking in Jamaican Patois on the 2020 Golden Globes red carpet, to recent allegations of physical altercations between himself and ex-girlfriend Kiana Parker, his disrespectful and inappropriate actions have, for many, made it incredibly hard to view White Boy Summer in a positive light.
While Hanks’ past may prevent White Boy Summer from coming to fruition, perhaps his intentions of equality for the movement can find some relevance approaching summer 2021. As Hanks said, “the real vibes is having nothing but good vibes towards everybody.” Instead of acting out of hate, Chet Hanks wisely suggests that all people: “Just stay suck-a-duckin and dummy-dodgin.”

UPDATED: April 13, 2021 at 1:45 p.m.
The entertainment industry is never one to turn down a cash cow. After the buying of long positions, through which Redditors held onto the GameStop’s stock as hedge fund managers shorted it last month, Netflix, MGM, and HBO all optioned the rights to the “saga” for future movies and docuseries. For those who haven’t heard, Redditors drove up the price of the video game store’s stock at the end of February after hearing that Wall Street investors had gotten wind that GameStop’s value would plummet. Their collective mass buying of the stock in turn drove the value up by 700%, causing major losses for investors who had betted against that happening. It’s too early to say exactly what angle the upcoming movie and TV features will have, but it’s likely an angle that we’ve seen before.
Take “The Social Network,” for instance. The 2010 film chronicled the birth of Facebook, depicting Mark Zuckerberg’s machinations and his eventual power grab from the men who had helped him create the product in the first place. Perhaps because in 2010, Facebook was neither as large nor as infamous, the movie focused more on the company’s birth rather than anything else. Arguably, the GameStop movies could do the same thing: focus on the drama and high stakes of the stock price rising astronomically, but far less on deeper issues that maybe merit further scrutiny, namely that when regular people play the stock market in the way Wall Street managers do, there are penalties, even though there aren’t really any when the opposite is true.
There are two immediately obvious paths for these entertainment giants to take. They could zoom in on the action, focus on an individual Redditor or two, and create action films or docuseries that teach the audience a surprising amount of information about finance, Wall Street, and how the stock market works. In these productions, the emphasis would be on plot, and perhaps less on the broader situation.
The alternative to that is far more interesting and necessary to explore: what led to these Redditors’ decision to establish a long position — to drive the price up — in the first place. Many of them were angry about widening wealth inequality, only exacerbated further by the pandemic, and wanted to “go to war.” And they’re completely justified in doing so, as we’ve gotten used to watching finance executives play with the lives and investments of millions. Of course, Wall Street got involved, worrying that these shenanigans weren’t fair, but since when has the stock exchange been a reliable arbiter on what’s fair? (It’s hard to forget what those same Wall Street executives did more than a decade ago in the 2008 recession.) It’s not that Redditors had a particular bone to pick with the company, but rather that perhaps many of them felt they had no other recourse. It’s no secret that the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer, especially during the pandemic’s k-shaped recovery. After all, Jeff Bezos makes a little under $150,000 per minute, while others wait desperately for stimulus checks.
It’s too early to tell what angle Netflix and the other companies will take. But it would be interesting, refreshing, and thought-provoking if they moved away from telling the story of the chaos that ensued, and more about why this happened in the first place. Who knows — we may be pleasantly surprised.
CORRECTION: April 13, 2021
A previous version of this story misstated that the GameStop stock was shorted by many investors earlier this year. In fact, investors established long positions which drove the stock price up.

After his smash hit “Old Town Road,” Lil Nas X has returned with yet another bop that has broken the internet. A story of queer repression, Lil Nas X plays with biblical references in “Montero (Call Me By Your Name),” while reclaimingownership of his identity as a gay man.
Lil Nas X, also known as Montero Lamar Hall, prefaces the video with "In life, we hide parts of ourselves we don’t want the world to see / We lock them away, we tell them ‘no’, we banish them / But here, we don’t / Welcome to Montero." Here he is giving access to a part of him he has not yet revealed. By calling this fantasy world “Montero,” he blatantly breaks down barriers, showing his true colors.
“Montero” contains three distinct acts, with the first taking place in what appears to be the Garden of Eden. Lil Nas X plays the role of Adam, sitting at the stump of a tree playing guitar and singing about his lover. “I caught it bad yesterday / You hit me with a call to your place,” he says as a serpent appears. As Adam, Lil Nas X begins to run away but is soon tempted by the serpent, also played by him. An internal struggle becomes apparent as he runs away from a different version of himself, presumably his sexual identity. Now face-to-face, the serpent sings “If Eve ain’t in your garden, you know that you can call me when you want.” Soon after this, Adam is seduced and the two kiss. After, the camera pans to the tree of knowledge, inscribed with a short excerpt from Plato’s “Symposium.” The Greek inscription says “After the division the two parts of man, each desiring his other half.” This phrase is curious, as it alludes to the normalization of homosexuality, and from it, it is becoming more clear that Lil Nas X is speaking out about his sexuality.
As the second verse begins, the scene changes to Lil Nas X shackled in a coliseum wearing a Marie Antoinette wig. It is clear he is not welcome, as the arena is full of shouting figures. Those judging him, who are also all played by him, disapprove of what they see and banish him to his death, yet another example of his internal struggle.
Now dead, his spirit ascends to heaven, and not far behind is an angel who appears to be guiding him. However, before he can reach heaven, a pole emerges from below and Lil Nas X grabs hold of it, sailing down to the depths of hell. This idea was inspired by FKA Twigs’s “Cellophane” music video in which she falls from the sky while pole dancing. This is the first shot in the music video where Lil Nas X is open about his identity. He can be seen with red braids, wearing black briefs, stiletto knee-high boots, and fake tattoos to portray a complete transformation.
At the bottom, he lands in what appears to be hell at the entrance of the devil’s lair, and he confidently walks up to Satan sitting at his throne, passing a Latin phrase “They condemn what they do not understand.” Moments after saying ‘Fuck it. Let’s ride,” he gives the devil a lap dance. For the rest of the song, he continues seducing the devil until the final seconds, at which point he snaps the devil’s neck and removes his horned crown to place upon his own head, taking control of the underworld.
Both the song and the music video for “Montero (Call Me By Your Name)” are full of meaning and biblical references, alluding to Lil Nas X’s upbringing in a religious community where he was taught to hate himself and made to believe he did not belong. This music video takes the homophobia often associated with Christian communities and spins it to play in Lil Nas X’s favor. He illustrates the power one is capable of when they accept who they are, as he deceives the devil, becoming ruler of the underworld.

The newest trailer for “Loki” is as chaotic and intriguing as the beloved Marvel Cinematic Universe villain himself. The trailer begins with the opening of a rectangular portal and an elevator ding, as a very upset post-Battle of New York Loki (Tom Hiddleston) steps out, apprehended by a helmeted officer holding the Tesseract. A montage of a strangely-bureaucratic timekeeper headquarters, overlaid by eerie synth music and Loki’s eloquent insults towards his new captors, offers the first official introduction to the Time Variance Authority (TVA).
The atmospheric dissonance between this new fantastical world and the clinical feeling of its framework is broken by the introduction of Mobius (Owen Wilson), who has absolutely no time for Loki’s grievances. After some quick back-and forth, Mobius pulls the upper hand by comically pressing the TVA’s version of a eject button, making Loki fall through the floor into a grayscale office with a man, his cat, and a massive pile of papers he must “verify [that it] is everything [he’s] ever said,” with his most recent quip immediately added to the pile.
After an enticing look at a green and gold version of the Marvel Studios logo, Mobius, in explaining the situation to Loki, cleanly lays out for the audience exactly what this show is about. When the Avengers went back in time to get the Infinity Stones during the events of “Avengers: Endgame,” the 2012 version of Loki (prior to his questionable redemption arc in “Thor: Ragnarok”) got a hold of the Tesseract and escaped, breaking reality and splintering time in the process. Mobius enlists (read: forces) Loki to help the TVA clean up the multiverse mess he’s made.
Loki is, at first, not trusted with a weapon (a fair and sound decision). However, in the following scene compilation showing Loki on missions with TVA agents, the trickster wields a new pair of daggers (who’s to say if that means the TVA reverses their decision, or if Loki has simply stolen them from somewhere). This isn’t the only new weapon in Loki’s arsenal: In the briefest of scene cuts, Loki fires magical green blasts at an enemy — a power he’s never before shown in the MCU. During this sequence, Mobius confesses to trusting “this Loki variant,” leaving fans to wonder if the Lokis of other timelines will make an appearance, or even if the show’s starring Loki will have to fight another version of himself.
Mobius and Loki engage in more quips and battles of wits, so the show is sure to satisfy those that come looking for the titular character’s trademark sass. The final moments of the trailer are, yet again, a group of two second clips smashed together to grab the audience’s attention with intense fight choreography, mystical settings, and Loki looking dramatically into the distance in formal business wear. These final moments don’t tease too much, but most interestingly, there’s a scene of Loki on a plane where he bears an uncanny resemblance to D.B. Cooper, and another scene depicting Loki sitting on a very purple landscape talking to a mysterious woman. With the woman’s reddish hair and all-black outfit, several fans have speculated that it’s Black Widow on Vormir (where she had sacrificed herself to obtain the Soul Stone in “Avengers: Endgame”), but it's more likely that it is the infamous Lady Loki, a fan favorite of those familiar with the comic books who could easily fit into a multiverse storyline.
Other than confirming the premise of the show and proving the high production value, the two minute and 16 second trailer doesn’t reveal too much of the plot. However, it raises a plethora of questions, and the show is already noteworthy as the first installment of the MCU that really explores the multiverse’s potential post-“Avengers: Endgame.” Furthermore, Loki is an iconic fan favorite, and Marvel seems to trust any content that shows off the trickster — so much so that “Loki” was rumored for a second season six months before the first is set to air. Even if someone didn’t consider themselves a fan of Loki, his meddling with the multiverse is rumored to directly set up the upcoming “Dr. Strange 2: Multiverse of Madness,” meaning that “Loki” will become required viewing for the MCU’s Phase Four.
Love him or hate him, the fan anticipation for “Loki” is boundless, and the mysteries the trailer presents hint that the show has a solid chance of living up (and even surpassing) the growing hype. It won’t be difficult for Marvel to cement a passionate viewership for “Loki,” which is set to premiere on Disney+ on June 11.

This review contains spoilers.
“Night in Paradise” is quite the misleading title for director Park Hoon-jung’s (“The Witch: Part 1. The Subversion”, “New World”) latest gruesome Korean gangster film. Many of the scenes, featuring both blood-soaked gang fights and mukbang-level meals, occur during the day and definitely do not depict paradise, even if the film is set in one of Earth’s closest approximations of heaven, Jeju Island. Despite the masterful cinematography that elegantly captures the irony between the serene ocean view setting and the violent, gory shootouts, “Night in Paradise” scrambles to rely on its ghastly shock value to tell an otherwise dull story of Korean mobsters.
To put it simply, “Night in Paradise” is not for the faint of heart. Even before the title card flashes on screen 18 minutes into the movie, the protagonist, mobster Tae-goo (Um Tae-goo), witnesses the murder of his sister and niece in a staged car accident; he then goes on a rampage, while naked in a sauna, to exact revenge on the enemy Bukseong gang’s leader who was supposedly behind this heinous order. In a gory and efficient manner that feels almost too easy, Tae-goo gets the job done with just one knife. He is then sent off to Jeju Island by his boss, Gang Boss Yang (Park Ho-san), to wait things out while the gang world cools down. In Jeju, Tae-goo hunkers down with stone-faced sharpshooter Jae-yeon (Jeon Yeo-been) and her uncle (Lee Ki-young) who is an arms dealer with his own history of involvement with gangs.
Meanwhile back on the mainland, Yang attempts a power-grabbing move into the Bukseong gang’s territory, but all goes terribly wrong. Yang finds himself at the mercy of Executive Ma (Cha Seung-won), the new de facto leader of the Bukseong gang, and in an attempt to save his own skin, Yang sells out his own gang, including Tae-goo. What follows is a typical, easily-predictable gangster narrative of hunt, escape, sacrifice, and betrayal. A predictable storyline does not necessarily mean that the film is bad, especially if it is well-executed to make the old feel fresh and new. However, “Night in Paradise” fails to develop the storyline into something original and instead relies heavily on shock value of overdrawn and overly barbaric fight scenes that leave the audience wanting to avert their eyes. For example, in one scene, Tae-goo gets beat to the point where his face is almost unidentifiable for five minutes.
Another flaw of this film is the lack of meaningful character development, especially for the only main female character, Jae-yeon. This is especially disappointing considering that in Park Hoon-jung’s previous work, “The Witch: Part 1. The Subversion,” he created such a complex, multi-layered antihero in its female lead, Ja-yoon — a rarity, considering Korean cinema’s inclinations toward exclusively male “badass” characters. In “Night in Paradise,” Jae-yeon is the attempt at a “badass” girlboss with her freakishly accurate shooting skills and dry, cynical humor, managing to hold her own against gangsters despite being terminally ill. But the potential of developing Jae-yeon’s own storyline of finding justice for her family’s murder at the hands of gangsters (another plotline that is never truly explained) gets overshadowed by an awkward effort at a potential love story between Tae-goo and Jae-yeon. Jae-yeon’s character simply becomes a plot device, a damsel in distress, when she is captured by Ma and Yang in order to force Tae-goo’s hand and move along the male-dominated gangster plotline. The few opportunities that Jae-yeon is given to show complex morals is when she has a gun in her hand. The final scene is Yeo-been mauling down all the enemies who killed Tae-goo, after which she puts the gun against her head again and the film ends with the echoes of the gunshot. There is nothing poetic nor “badass” about Jae-yeon’s character in the end.
Despite all these shortcomings, “Night in Paradise” does have its good moments. The actors — especially Jeon Yeo-been, who plays cynical, take-no-shit Jae-yeon — deliver a strong performance to inject energy into the movie. Jeon Yeo-been and Um Tae-goo’s bonding scene of eating mulhoe, Korean spicy raw fish soup, and Park Ho-san and Cha Seung-won’s tense negotiation scene of eating jajangmyeon, Korean black bean noodles, both deserve awards for the incredible mukbang.
Unfortunately, the overall pace of “Night in Paradise” felt like a teenage driver learning to use the brakes for the first time: The sudden bursts of unnecessary violence and random plot devices give a jerky feel that takes away from the strengths of the movie and leaves the audience feeling a bit nauseous.

The 27th Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards ceremony was the (virtual) place to be on April 4. Aside from honoring the best acting performances in this year’s top TV shows and movies, the 27th SAG Award ceremony was full of stars flaunting their fashion from home. There were monochrome outfits and sequins galore; Nothing was off the table for nominees, not even pajamas — Daniel Kaluuya accepted an award for his performance in “Judas and the Black Messiah” in a chic pinstriped royal purple pajama set by Louis Vuitton that probably costs more than your car. So, which stars were best dressed? Here are our top five.
5. Dan Levy
Dan Levy made all of us laugh in “Schitt’s Creek.” Now, he’s making us want to purchase brooches. Sporting a cream suit by The Row, Dan Levy wowed us with his spring fashion, and he might have single-handedly resurrected brooches as a fashion statement. Along with his cream and light blue flower brooch, some tasteful Cartier jewels and sunglasses complete the effortlessly stylish look.
4. Anya Taylor-Joy
Anya Taylor-Joy, otherwise known as Beth Harmon from “The Queen’s Gambit,” gave off major Audrey Hepburn golden-age vibes with her classy cream-colored Vera Wang gown with black lace trim. Anya Taylor-Joy is living the “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” dream, wearing upwards of $800,000 worth of Tiffany & Co. jewelry. Her gown definitely pulls off an ageless glamor.
3. Regé-Jean Page
In true “Bridgerton” fashion, Regé-Jean Page was dressed like a duke for the awards ceremony. Regé-Jean Page also hopped on the monochrome trend, wearing a well-tailored black velvet Louis Vuitton suit and matching quilted shoes. His dress shirt has a subtle pattern that adds some dimension to the look — And, let’s face it: Anything Regé-Jean Page wears looks good on him.
2. Emma Corrin
Emma Corrin, channeling some Princess Diana fashion energy, really stole the show with her red carpet outfit. The “The Crown” star was dressed in a Prada ensemble that embodied high-risk high-reward fashion. Is it a lacy spring dress? Is it a private-school uniform? Where did the lace up chunky black boots and matching clip belt come from? We may never know. But, what we do know is that Emma Corrin is absolutely stunning in this edgy dress.
1. Kerry Washington
Ariel has nothing on Kerry Washington, who was nominated for her performance in “Little Fires Everywhere.” Taking full advantage of the virtual awards stage, Kerry Washington decided to go for a swim, plunging into her backyard pool wearing a stunning Etro gown and matching swim cap, both covered in ornate dark-blue beading. Half-submerged in pool water for her red carpet photoshoot, Kerry Washington is a high fashion mermaid.
These stars managed to deliver amazing looks even from home, setting the bar higher for the 28th SAG Awards next year.

Despite the “Cemetery of Forgotten Books” series selling more than 35 million copies worldwide and being published in more than 40 countries, I think this series is criminally underrated in the United States. Carlos Ruiz Zafón’s four-novel set is a masterpiece in intricacy and Gothic literature. Set in Barcelona during the twentieth-century, Zafón’s web of multigenerational characters navigate the sprawling streets and secret histories of the city, ensconced by its magic, as readers walk away with their own map of the land.
With strange and excessive parallels to main character Daniel Sempere, I discovered the first novel of Zafón’s series through poetic chance and literary luck. While browsing the Stanford bookstore in 2017, I found myself in conversation with a sales aid, who happened to be a rather animated 80-year-old publishing assistant. He graced me with the story of when he first started as an editing assistant, describing how he read so constantly and so extensively that, within 50 pages of beginning to edit a novel, he could predict the ending flawlessly. I laughed along with him until he produced Carlos Ruiz Zafón’s “Shadow of the Wind” out of nowhere, stating Zafón’s book was the only novel in decades he failed to predict. I have to admit I was incredibly skeptical, assuming I was being swayed by a clever sales pitch, but four years later, I am infinitely grateful I purchased the book anyway — because he was absolutely right.
With multiple stories layered upon one another, “The Shadow of the Wind” follows young bookworm Daniel Sempere as he discovers a book within the book, also titled, “The Shadow of the Wind.” Fueled by youthful curiosity, Daniel embarks on a journey to uncover the author, Julian Carx’s mysterious past and avoid the shadowy forces that seem to seek the book’s destruction, only to find himself unraveling buried stories of violence, betrayal, and deceitful lust from the Spanish Civil War and the destruction of Barcelona. This book is an absolute whirlwind, jumping throughout decades as it creates a web of characters so intricate it could be a history of its own.
“The Shadow of the Wind” is one of four novels in the series, but it is by no means the one you must read first. Each of the novels focus on a piece of Zafón’s history of Barcelona, spanning decades, with every character and plot expertly threaded to another. With all its intrigue and scandal, nothing excited me more than glimpses of characters’ pasts popping up in every novel. Zafón subtly but satisfyingly creates a romantic wholeness to the entire series’ narrative like none I have encountered before. This carefully constructed history means that the four books can be read in any order, each storyline rife with clues to the others. My personal recommendation is to begin with “The Shadow of the Wind,” progress to “The Angel’s Game,” then “Prisoner of Heaven,” and conclude with “The Labyrinth of Spirits.”
The interlocking plots are so carefully constructed that Zafón himself notes how delicate they are in multiple interviews, the overall narrative perfectly and precisely fitted together. Each novel unearths age-old questions grounded in romantically tragic characters, soaked in magical realism and decadence. A haunted author tasked with writing a new religion of violence, postwar reckonings of unimaginable sin, and a labyrinth of forgotten books converge to create this four-novel love letter to Gothic Barcelona and the untamable power of books.
Zafón himself is quite the character, his writing process inexplicably involving 400 statues and representations of dragons as well as periods of self-taught piano composing. He has adamantly declared the “Cemetery of Forgotten Books” series will never be seen in film, staying true to his affinity for the medium of the novel. For all my love of these books, I understand his position — the experience of piecing together Zafón’s history restored my adoration of literature, and I cannot imagine a film captivating readers so effectively.
For being considered the most-read Spanish series since the writings of Cervantes, Zafón’s novels are, in my opinion, underappreciated among American audiences. Perhaps it is the historical element that scares off readers of contemporary fiction, or the fact American publishers are printing mere translations of Zafón’s original words. Regardless, legendary author Stephen King commended the book, “If you thought the true Gothic novel died with the 19th Century, this will change your mind. Shadow is the real deal, a novel full of cheesy splendor and creaking trapdoors, a novel where even the subplots have subplots.” Indeed, Zafón’s books are full of clichés, but they are nonetheless satisfyingly complex and dramatic.
A perfect, fantastical escape for everyday life, and certainly the current state of the world, Carlos Ruiz Zafón’s sprawling, haunted, and romantic Barcelona is worth a visit.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The influence of family is near inescapable, even with the distance created by time and estrangement — a fact explored through the three generations of family history laid out in “The Stone Loves the World,” the latest novel by Brian J. Hall ‘81. An expansive story that explores love and humanity through the binary of arts and sciences, Hall’s novel is a charming, if sometimes meandering, look at an untraditional family working through its flaws.
“The Stone Loves the World” serves as a follow up to “The Saskiad,” a novel about the character Saskia White. The lynchpin of this sequel is twenty-year old Mette, Saskia’s eccentric yet mathematically brilliant daughter — who has just disappeared after having her first and unfortunately unlucky romantic entanglement, taking off without a word to either of her parents. Mette takes after her father Mark, a reclusive and distant astronomy professor. As a result, Saskia — an actress and writer who grew up in a New York commune — often struggles to communicate with and understand the two’s hyper-logical and scientific minds. Though the narrative is ostensibly centered around Mette’s disappearance and her parents’ concern for her, the story that shines through is the rich family history that culminates in Mette and her current predicament.
The two sides of Mette’s family tree tend to the extremes of artists and scientists: Saskia’s father Thomas was the charismatic leader of a commune in upstate New York, and Mark is often socially inept due to his intensely logical mind. Mark and his father Vernon often display an arrogance and dismissiveness of what they view to be the fallacies of non-scientists. At one point, Vernon plays out a conversation from memory that concludes with him stating, “You don’t know. So your opinion is worthless.” The extreme personalities and highly specialized interests of the characters result in an impressive breadth of subjects, yet they can devolve into long explanations of concepts and stories that take up significant real estate in the novel and are likely to lose the readers.
Despite the tendency to fall back on stereotypes of emotionally removed scientists, Mark is also depicted as applying his scientific analysis to his own emotions and relationships. It is his musings in ‘data sets’ — spare lines that form a kind of descriptive poem in attempts to describe things that call up an “unnameable emotion” — and Mette’s mostly cynical yet occasionally clear-eyed analysis of the meaning and purpose of life that give the novel its moments of pleasing depth and insight.
The writing, much like Mark’s attempts, seems unable to keep itself from slipping into a modern, poetry-like free verse at times. When Mette reaches her destination, she thinks, “here she is in Seattle/ without a fucking clue/ what to do.” These smoothly unconscious transitions serve as a testament to Hall’s skill at presenting each character’s voice. With each character’s personality, the style adapts smoothly — choppy and mechanical when Mette is distressed and thinking especially mathematically, or poetic and imaginative when Saskia is thinking. “Saskia weed-whacked her sense of affront, watered her gratitude.”
The little plot that exists is confined to Mette’s journey of self-discovery as she struggles with depression and thoughts of suicide after opening herself up to a romantic prospect for the first time in her twenty years of life. Though it is clear that the value of the novel lies not in plot, Mette’s narrative is dissatisfying in its inconclusiveness. Her confusion and excitement in the beginning about her love interest Alex’s nonbinary/gender-fluid identity seems as though it might spark something in herself, but then doesn’t really resolve itself into anything. Mette cycles through thoughts of the meaning of life without exploring much about herself and her own identity, her gender expression, or her sexuality.
Though the novel seems to contain depths yet unmined — perhaps drowned out by the lengthy forays into music or mathematical theory — it is still a lovely look at relationships and the different ways people see the world. Through each character, echoes of the various generations are evident, the same sort of struggles and pathos. With Mette as the centerpiece, “The Stone Loves the World” lays out the beautiful complexities of how generations can culminate in a person, as well as the strength and power of family even when you least expect it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The accessibility of science to the general public has somewhat of a backwards story. For a while in the early 19th century, many could build microscopes or pick up books to identify rock or animal species and take part in scientific truth-seeking in forests or along coastlines. But by the late 19th century and especially after World War II, science became increasingly professionalized and expensive; current massive genome sequencing and particle accelerator projects feature hundreds of contributors per paper. The gap widens between scientists and the potentially interested but more passive public.
On the flip side, science and society are more linked than ever. We don’t have to look further than the day’s top headlines to see how immunology and engineering permeate our lives.
So how much distance should there be between the scientific and public spheres?
Enter science communication, which aims to bridge the gap between science production and public understanding. Along this road of science communication, the questions continue. Who mediates what gets through to the public and what gets set to the side? How do we balance a right to know with what some may consider, subjectively, the best to know?
Current science is characterized by an informational overload. Nearly 100,000 papers on Covid-19 have already been published, for example. Each paper features hyper-specific information — specific models and criteria, highly contextualized results and deficiencies — all wrapped up in confusing jargon. Even scientists in different highly specialized biological fields can’t fully evaluate each others’ work!
Say the effectiveness of a vaccine or cancer treatment is debated. Do we limit what information gets put out, so that there aren’t mixed messages? Should there be referee panels that evaluate controversies for a degree of consensus or accepted “truth” before widespread publication or public policy implementation?
Opinions differ. Some worry that presenting scientific conclusions as preliminary can backfire, endangering public trust. However, New York Times science columnist Carl Zimmer thinks that “sounds quite condescending and counterproductive.”
“If you present things as absolute truth, you're going to have to then present some other absolute truth,” Zimmer told me in an interview.
Craig Venter, the pioneer in synthetic biology who led research on the first draft sequence of the human genome, said he thinks that controversies are oftentimes what make things “even more interesting.”
He argues that every scientist has “a moral obligation to communicate what they're doing to the public” which includes “the good and the bad, and the ugly.” Venter mentioned that “a lot of studies, for example, deserve more public criticism, because their sample size is way too small to draw the conclusions that they’re drawing.”
Despite science journalists’ best efforts to communicate nuance, science in popular media can face limited airtime or attention spans, resulting in truncated presentations of information that can lose conditionals and present findings as far more absolute than they are. Statistics may not be fully fleshed out, and headlines can broadly oversimplify. Plus, though they shouldn’t, some “reporters can be lazy and can just present things as absolute truth,” as Zimmer put it.
In the best case scenario, scientists who are experts in their respective fields become scientific ambassadors of sorts. Michael Faraday, the scientist who discovered the mechanism underlying electromagnetic radiation, gave a famous series of “Christmas Lectures” in 1825 designed for a general audience. Now, we have TED Talks, or open houses at Venter’s J. Craig Venter Institute where scientists make presentations for members of the community.
“People are interacting face to face, quite often one-on-one with scientists and they get to ask questions that they can't ask of a newspaper,” Venter said. “[They] really like it.”
So it seems obvious that more public opportunities for science communication would be valuable. Additionally, graduate schools and scientific career development should place more value on public engagement training. Having more journalists trained in science, as well as increased general science literacy, will also help. And science journalism needs sustained funding, far beyond the pandemic.
But such changes won’t be enough. As we navigate these issues of scientific gatekeeping and credibility, it is crucial to consider the public’s impression of science.
According to Harvard psychology professor Steven Pinker, it can’t just be presented as “one tribe making pronouncements.”
Pinker told me in an interview that it shouldn’t be like “trust the scientists or don't trust the scientists, but it should be that the actual data, the actual logic of the experiments is explained.”
“There are studies that show that when you present data in graphs, even on politicized issues, people can change their minds,” he said.
For this column, I’ve spoken to Nobel prize winners and bestselling authors, leading scientists and bioethicists. The idea of emphasizing the scientific process has come up in almost every interview so far. Science will be paramount in future policy making, especially as issues of the scientific future like climate change and artificial general intelligence will become increasingly tied up with humanity’s future. (As Venter said, if science doesn’t play a major role in future decision making, “we're screwed.”)
We have to start with the “basic epistemic humility that launched science,” Pinker said. “Remind people that we start ignorant about everything. It's only by a very arduous process of conjecturing, of explanations, and then trying to determine whether they are true or false that we can know anything about anything.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For me, December 2019 was the end of an endless cycle of worrying. Worrying about what I wore to my interview at New York’s Harvard Club. Were my answers too short? Too long? Did I sound pretentious? Never mind my interviewers: Would I even want to be my roommate? Questioning whether that B in freshman geometry had already ended my chances at a Harvard education.
Yet, when I opened my application portal and discovered my acceptance, for the first time in years, I wasn’t worried. Unlike thousands of others, I wasn’t left wondering what went wrong or how I could have been a better applicant, a better student, or just simply better. I felt perfectly lucky.
Because I felt confident in my choice to not look back on my life of worrying — to maintain the mystery of my lucky life — I hadn’t been motivated to revisit what had been such a worrisome time in my life, when many of my friends began taking advantage of a 1970s law that enables university students to request their admissions file: the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. However, when members of the Class of 2020 reported that they seemingly got their admissions file uploaded to their my.harvard portals in January, I was overtaken by interest. While I haven’t seen my file, I was eager to speak with others who had to learn what the experience had revealed for them.
Motivated by curiosity, Syd D. Sanders ‘24, a freshman from Belfast, Maine, requested to see his admissions file at the same time as his two roommates. He expected to read anodyne remarks from his admissions officers and a warm report from an interview that in his view went well. The whole ordeal was not supposed to be especially nerve-wracking. After all, in a process where the vast majority of applicants are rejected, he got in. But the experience turned into something else entirely.
While the (written) comments from the admissions officers touched on the parts of his application that he expected, such as his class rank and other parts of his school record, the report from his interviewer was devoted almost entirely to a discussion of Sanders’s identity as a transgender man.
The interviewer wrote in detail about Sanders’s physicality, noting what parts of him appeared more masculine and feminine, and stated that “he could easily be mistaken for a female.” The interviewer also pondered how Syd would appear in a few years, questioning how his roommates and classmates would feel about him, and calling Sanders’s trans identity a “sexual choice.” Syd, who was the first out trans valedictorian in Maine’s history, has experienced transphobia before — but that didn’t make the comments left by his interviewer less hurtful. In his words, when it comes college admissions “people think being a minority is an advantage, but I didn’t feel advantaged.”
The “energy and passions” that Sanders brought to his interview were frequently reduced to cutting remarks about his appearance, which makes him worried about how future trans kids applying to the college may be judged for their identity.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an email that “Harvard Admissions and Financial Aid takes seriously all complaints from applicants and encourages students to bring to our attention directly any concerns they have about their interview.”
Sanders and his roommate requested to see their admissions files and neither expected anything shocking. Yet, unlike Sanders, Scott W. Arbery '24, from Atlanta, Ga. — and Sanders’s roommate — more or less found what he was expecting.
In Arbery’s interviewer’s eyes, he was “nice and normal,” easy to talk to, and well-mannered. She noted that he thanked her several times for making the 45-minute drive to their interview, a tribute to Arbery’s character. And while Arbery thinks the interview process failed his friend, he said he also feels that the more personal aspects of applications deserve a place in our admissions process, despite the biases of interviewers and admissions officers. For him, the college experience is about more than just academics and the coronavirus pandemic has shown him how important community can be.
Partly inspired by reading his own admissions file, Eric J. Cheng ’20, who graduated from Harvard in the midst of the pandemic, quickly volunteered to be an alumni interviewer for applicants from Southern California. As Cheng sees it, he would not have gotten in if not for his interview and thought he could replicate the grace and advocacy his interviewer showed to him when he applied to the college. It was his way to “pay it forward.”
Because Cheng graduated from Harvard so recently, he said he felt uniquely positioned to understand in what ways the college’s culture was failing students who were not white and male. Almost the complete opposite of Syd’s experience, Cheng used his background as a racial minority and member of the BGLTQ community to connect to those he interviewed, all of whom “had some minority status.” Upon finding out that some of his interviewees were accepted, he had an “Oh my God” moment. He was invested in their journeys.
Sanders’s experience uncovering the uglier parts of his admission represents the darker side of a deeply imperfect system.
Speaking with Sanders, Arbery, and Cheng has revealed to me what alumni interviews can do at their best. I feel lucky to go to school with Syd, yet it’s nauseating knowing that his application process was fettered with prejudice.
Though every applicant is more than just a collection of letters and numbers — that thousands of high school students like myself spend endless hours obsessing over — it can be perhaps more unsettling to know some of the most intimate aspects of our identities are being judged by other human beings that may not like what they see. And, as the SFFA v. Harvard lawsuit has elucidated in the case of Asian American applicants, Harvard’s personality scores can absorb biases from society at large and are by no means reflective of objective reality.
The stories of Sanders, Arbery, and Cheng emphasize the immense subjectivity of the college admission process. Contrary to popular belief, there is no “perfect applicant,” and the fates of each applicant come down to the subjective analysis of admissions officers at the Brattle Street office, or now on a Zoom screen. Achievements and personality are translated to the esoteric vernacular of admissions officers carefully crafting Harvard College’s next iteration.
Last week, Harvard, the most selective undergraduate institution in the country as of 2024, announced an even lower admissions rate of only 3.43 percent for the Class of 2025. While I’ll be happy to see those students who choose to make Harvard their home walking around campus next year, it is bittersweet because the majority of applicants who embraced vulnerability, sharing who they are on their applications, will be left wondering what went wrong for them in the cold calculus of college admissions offices.
Unfortunately, there will be no answers for those students, and what amounted to the end of my time worrying may well be a new worry for them. However, as some students who learned what went “right” in their admissions found out, the answers often say more about the people reading applications than those who write them.

TPRV Capital, LP — a hedge-fund which launched with $400 million in seed capital from Harvard Management Company in 2017 — announced that it will cease operations, liquidate all assets, and return all of its capital to its investors in an update sent to the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 9.
TPRV’s investors sought to “redeem” their funds, citing the hedge fund’s troubling performance in the months immediately following the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States, the fund’s Chief Operating Officer, Luca Toscani, said in an interview.
Though the hedge fund recovered its losses from early in the pandemic, Toscani said investors still came to the decision to move their assets toward other types of investment strategies.
“When coronavirus started being an issue and lockdowns around the country had been implemented, it was a pretty challenging month for the market and then we had some problems performance-wise; since then, the performance has been actually very good,” Toscani said. “However, the drawdown triggered a number of redemptions for our investors.”
The firm saw its peak assets of $820 million at the end of 2019 plummet to $570 million by August 2020, according to a report by Bloomberg. Its assets further plunged to $233 million by February of this year.
TPRV’s fund lost 2.8 percent in 2020 and remained constant in the first two months of 2021, per the same report.
Toscani would not say if the Harvard Management Company itself expressed enough concern over TPRV’s investment strategy to the point that it also asked to redeem its funds.
Patrick S. McKiernan, a spokesperson for HMC, declined to comment on TPRV’s unwinding of operations or HMC’s involvement with the fund, citing its policy not to comment on individual investments.
For Toscani and his partners, their next steps are unclear. The fund’s management wrote in an email to investors that they are still considering their next steps. Toscani said the firm had difficulty in finding new capital providers but hopes that TPRV’s investment team will be able to work within a larger, more established fund.
TPRV’s closure marks the fifth Harvard-sponsored hedge fund to wind down its operations in the last couple of years. Cambridge Square Capital, Convexity Capital, Highfield Capital, and Frontlight Capital — high-profile hedge funds also managed by former HMC portfolio managers and sponsored with seed capital from HMC — have ceased operations.
TPRV’s two co-founders and Co-Chief Investment Officers, Graig Fantuzzi and Michele Toscani, left the Harvard Management Company in 2017 with almost $400 million in seed capital from Harvard to start their own firm.
Fantuzzi and Michele Toscani, the twin brother of Luca Toscani, were portfolio managers at HMC and had worked together for eight years, including serving as co-heads of HMC’s Tufnell Park Relative Value — an investment strategy abbreviated as TPRV — team.
TPRV’s closure is only the latest in a wave of hedge-funds going under. Finance experts like Charles A. Skorina, a financial executive headhunter, have noted that over the past decade, very few hedge funds have done well given the Federal Reserve’s decision to keep interest rates near zero for more than a decade.
“These are tough times — very few hedge funds have done well,” Skorina said. “The Federal Reserve has really messed things up.”
“The big firms can borrow money at a couple of 100 basis points less than 1 percent, and they’re just throwing it into the stock market, and when and if the Fed finally starts raising rates, you will see the stock market hit the pause button,” he said. “But until that happens, it’s just a game of musical chairs — that’s why so many of these supposedly smart people at hedge funds that Harvard had invested in and others are doing not well at all.”
“It doesn’t mean they’re stupid,” Skorina added. “It means that there are no interest rate signals.”

Cambridge Chief Public Health Officer Claude Jacob said local vaccination efforts remain hampered by supply shortages, despite federally run sites having recently received more doses.
Jacob presented the update during the weekly Covid-19 pandemic response at a meeting of the city council Monday.
The state has recently increased supply to mass vaccination sites, such as the Hynes Convention Center in Boston, in order to bolster rollout, according to Jacob.
“The vaccine supply coming into the Commonwealth continues to increase, with much of the additional supply going to federally run programs at the area pharmacies and the FEMA program that’s anchored at the Hynes Convention Center,” Jacob said.
Last month, the state approved the Metro North partnership led by Cambridge and eight other cities to establish locally run vaccination sites, including one at Tufts University.
Jacob said, however, the program has yet to launch due to a shortage of supply.
“Once we have confirmation of the vaccine supply and our delivery, both timing of arrival and quantity, we will conduct outreach across the city to encourage residents to use the regional site to get their Covid vaccine, as well as to help them register and answer any questions and concerns,” Jacob said.
He added that Cambridge continues to be a “moderate risk level community” for the spread of the coronavirus, but noted the recent increase in case positivity among young adults.
“Statewide new infection rates over the last two weeks continue to be the highest among young adults in their 20s followed by teens ages 15 to 19,” Jacob said.
“Just know that about 40 percent of the new cases in the last two complete weeks have been among residents in their 20s,” he added.
The city is also working to mitigate the spread of Covid-19 variants. The B.1.1.7 virus variant has been detected at all four Cambridge screening sites and is “likely already circulating,” according to data from a city waste water analysis.
As of April 6, 34 percent of Cambridge residents had received at least one dose of the vaccine, with 19 percent of the city population fully vaccinated, according to City Manager Louis A. DePasquale.
Massachusetts residents ages 16 and older will be eligible to receive the vaccine beginning April 19.
The council also narrowly approved an amendment for a zoning petition that previously required a green roof or biosolar to be installed during construction or major renovations of buildings 20,000 square feet or larger. The amendment, which passed 5-4, added the option of installing a full solar array instead.
Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon, who proposed this amendment, said she did not “feel comfortable moving forward” with the original petition, pointing out that the Planning Board voted against it 8-1.
“Over the past couple of weeks I’ve met with local builders, both commercial and affordable, as well as affordable housing builders in other cities,” she said. “They have all said they have significant concerns about this petition and the fact that it lacks the option for a full solar array.”
Councilor Patricia M. “Patty” Nolan ’80, however, refuted the idea that green roofs or solar panels were exclusive options.
“The idea that green roofs are at odds with solar is inaccurate,” she argued. “They actually make solar more effective.”
Nolan cited green roof mandates in Portland, Ore., Copenhagen, and Switzerland as successful examples. She pushed back against a speaker during public comment who said developers would already be installing green roofs if they were effective.
“We should never ever look to developers or the free market to lead on climate change, that is why we’re in the mess that we’re in today,” she said.

A survey soliciting information on College students’ spring semester experiences released by the Undergraduate Council Tuesday found widespread student dissatisfaction with remote learning, their social lives, and Harvard policies related to the coronavirus pandemic.
The survey posed 78 questions asking students to report their experiences on topics ranging from mental health to academics to residential life. In total, 502 students — roughly 10 percent of the College student body — responded, according to the UC’s report, which makes recommendations to College administrators about fall 2021 planning.
“This is a rare opportunity to reimagine Harvard that should not be taken lightly,” the report reads. “Harvard’s decisions this Fall will set the tone for the remainder of the decade and beyond.”
The survey found that more than 95 percent of undergraduates prefer to live on campus than off campus in fall 2021. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ announcement that it is planning for a full return of students to campus in fall 2021 ranked as the most popular policy among students, per the survey.
Offering in-person courses ranked as the second most popular potential policy, followed by extending the deadlines to add or drop a class or take a class pass/fail to the 11th Monday of a semester — a policy the FAS implemented during the fall and spring semesters this academic year.
In contrast, wellness days received overwhelmingly negative responses from undergraduates with a mean score 0f 0.89 out of 10. To the chagrin of many College students, the FAS implemented five wellness days throughout the spring semester in lieu of a traditional week-long spring break to reduce travel during the global health crisis.
In the survey, however, students indicated they are supportive of continuing wellness days in future semesters in addition to spring break.
Students living in Harvard’s dorms during the spring semester indicated that they understood Harvard’s residential policies put in place to limit social life on campus. Still, some expressed frustration regarding limited access to on-campus resources, such as printers, common spaces, and study areas.
On-campus students also reported confusion over whether Harvard would update its residential policies as students receive the Covid-19 vaccine.
“Many undergraduates expressed confusion about whether Harvard would adopt new policies as more students become fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and whether fully vaccinated students would be able to access certain spaces (i.e. libraries, kitchens, indoor gatherings),” the report reads.
Harvard students suffered socially this academic year, the survey found. A majority of students indicated that they were “extremely dissatisfied” with their social lives.
“Students are highly dissatisfied with their social lives during the 2020-21 academic year and strongly believe that social life should be the number one priority for Harvard when it reopens this fall,” the report reads.
Student engagement in extracurricular activities was low, per the survey, as was student engagement with professional and academic services provided by the College.
To strengthen students’ social engagement, the report urges Harvard to create more opportunities for students to socialize on campus, including additional physical spaces and events for rising sophomores and juniors.
The survey also found that online learning harmed students’ mental health.
Students reported that their mental health deteriorated due to an apparent increase in academic pressure and a lack of boundaries between personal and academic life.
Eighty-eight percent of undergraduates reported having difficulty paying attention to online classes while 75 percent said they struggled to find the motivation to complete assignments.
Nearly half of survey respondents indicated they were unsatisfied with the quality of their education this academic year. Roughly 72 percent of students also indicated that they found online courses more challenging than in-person classes.
At the same time, students credited online learning with providing greater accessibility. Some students recommended that professors continue to hold office hours on Zoom and to post lecture recordings online in the future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Researchers at Harvard’s GenderSci Lab investigated the intersectionality of race, sex, and Covid-19 mortalities, as detailed in a study published earlier this month in the Journal of General Internal Medicine.
Previous studies have found the mortality rate of Covid-19 is higher in men than in women, and higher in Black individuals than in white individuals. However, unlike previous studies, this new paper — a collaboration across Harvard, MIT, University of Adelaide, and University of Southern Maine — found that the sex disparity greatly varies by race.
According to the paper, Black men in Michigan have the highest Covid-19 mortality rate — over six times as high as white men. Utilizing data from both Georgia and Michigan, the researchers also found that Black women have a mortality rate over three times larger than white or Asian/Pacific Islander men.
“It's Black men that have by far the highest rates, which is striking,” lead author and Harvard graduate student Tamara S. Rushovich said.
Rushovich also highlighted the significance of the finding that the disparity in Covid-19 mortality rates between Black men and Black women is greater than the disparity between white men and white women.
“That leads us to think that there must be some influence of racism and social factors that are influencing the disparity between men and women apart from potential biological mechanisms,” Rushovich said. “There's very likely some social factors and environmental context involved.”
Undergraduate research assistant Amelia F. “Mimi” Tarrant ’21 said the finding that Black women have a higher mortality rate than white men and Asian/Pacific Islander men complicates the oversimplified conclusion that men are dying due to Covid-19 at higher rates than women.
“So this universal claim that men have worse outcomes than women actually just doesn’t hold when you interact with race and ethnicity,” Tarrant said.
Tarrant said she hopes that the findings will provide a “critical lens” for exploring the impacts of Covid-19 on different demographics.
“It's really important that we start having conversations about interacting sex and gender, and race/ ethnicity to really understand an individual's risk to COVID-19, as it's very easy to kind of create a larger picture that actually isn't applicable at the individual level,” she said.
Tarrant noted that previous demographic studies on Covid-19 mortality rates often focused on biological factors, failing to address social and cultural factors.
“There was a lot of rhetoric around the sex essentialism of males vs. females, and sex and gender risk, and how that's differential between men and women,” Tarrant said. “I think taking too extreme of a biological view on it is very problematic, and not understanding that there are other factors at play — especially social factors — that often align more with gender.”
Although the study does not propose a declarative explanation of its findings, the researchers suggested future research could explore whether social factors such as housing conditions, existing comorbidities, access to healthcare, and occupations could be responsible for types of disparities they found.
“Who performs what essential worker jobs that might expose them to Covid more, who has more access to testing because of their employment, who can work from home?” Rushovich asked.

Over 40 percent of respondents to The Crimson’s survey of Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences said they believe the University’s standing within higher education has fallen during the past decade.
In addition, nearly 70 percent of faculty respondents said that grade inflation is a “prevalent” issue within their departments, with 34 percent “strongly” agreeing.
The Crimson distributed its faculty survey to more than 1,180 members of the FAS in late February, polling Harvard’s flagship faculty on key University policy decisions, challenges they face as academics, and pressing issues on campus — including the repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic. Tenured, tenure-track, and non-tenure-track faculty all received the survey.
The 94-question survey obtained more than 300 responses, though not all respondents answered each question. The anonymous survey, a link to which was emailed to nearly every member of the FAS, was open from Feb. 26 to March 5. The Crimson did not adjust the data for possible selection bias.
The first, second, third, and fourth installments of The Crimson’s 2021 faculty survey series explored faculty perspectives on tenure procedures, campus divestment movements, the climate and culture of the FAS, and the response to pandemic, respectively. This fifth installment examines how faculty view the University’s governance and standing within higher education.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain and FAS spokesperson Anna G. Cowenhoven declined to comment for this story.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s approval rating from faculty respondents increased between 2020 and 2021, from 39 to 48 percent. The proportion of respondents who said they believed Bacow has represented their interests well also rose slightly, from 25 to 31 percent.
Faculty opinions of FAS Dean Claudine Gay — consistently more favorable than Bacow — also marginally improved between 2020 and 2021. Her approval rating rose from 47 to 56 percent, and the proportion of respondents who believe she has represented their interests well grew from 39 to 44 percent.
A substantial majority — 69 percent — of respondents said they do not believe monthly faculty meetings are an effective forum for FAS faculty to express their interests. When prompted with a write-in question, several respondents described the meetings as “too impersonal,” “formulaic,” “too scripted,” and “largely ceremonial,” as well as poorly attended by members of the Sciences Division and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
Roughly 52 percent of respondents said the authority of the faculty has diminished over the past several years. Just 4 percent said faculty authority increased, with the other 44 percent responding that it has stayed the same. Approximately 67 percent of respondents believed the faculty should have more authority in FAS and University governance.
Common responses to a write-in question about what Bacow and Gay should prioritize during the rest of their terms included increasing support for non-ladder faculty, reforming the tenure review system, addressing climate change through fossil fuel divestment, retaining faculty of color, and maintaining academic freedom. One respondent said Bacow and Gay should prioritize the implementation of “more visionary initiatives,” as opposed to “maintenance of the status quo.”
Asked how they believe the University’s standing within higher education has changed over the past decade, 41 percent said it has fallen and 53 percent said it is unchanged. Only 6 percent said it has risen.
Nearly 70 percent of respondents said they believe grade inflation is a “prevalent” issue within their departments, with 34 percent agreeing “strongly.”
In a 2013 faculty meeting, then-Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris said that the median grade at the College is an A-, and the most commonly awarded grade is an A.
However, attitudes towards the prevalence of grade inflation varied based on discipline.
Just 50 percent of faculty at SEAS believed grade inflation is pervasive in their department, compared to 74 percent in the Sciences, 68 percent in the Social Sciences, and 69 percent in the Arts and Humanities.
Very few faculty respondents indicated they had students in the last year who required disciplinary action at the College or the University level; 9 percent said they referred a student to the Honor Council and 6 percent said they referred a student to the Administrative Board in the past year.
Roughly 50 percent of survey-takers indicated satisfaction with Harvard’s treatment of staff members during the pandemic, while 18 percent expressed “some” dissatisfaction and 9 percent expressed “extreme” dissatisfaction.
After transitioning to remote operations in March 2020, the University guaranteed full pay and benefits for all employees whose jobs had been idled by the pandemic.
However, starting in January 2021, the University ended pay and benefits for idled contract workers and reduced pay for directly-employed staff to 70 percent. Following the announcement, more than 1,100 Harvard affiliates signed a petition urging the University to extend employment protections for contract workers.
Asked how the University should maintain pay and benefits for idled workers, 78 percent of surveyed faculty indicated support for directly-employed staff and 63 percent indicated support for contract workers.
Facing significant budget deficits, 56 percent of respondents “strongly” agreed that the Harvard Corporation should draw more heavily on the University’s $41.9 billion endowment to support the FAS budget during the pandemic. Another 23 percent “somewhat” agreed.
In its 2020 annual report, the FAS projected a $111.7 million deficit in fiscal year 2021, following a $22 million deficit in fiscal year 2020.
In fiscal year 2020, 53 percent of the operating revenue of the FAS came from the endowment, a proportion only exceeded by the Divinity School and the Radcliffe Institute.
Though Gay initially announced last June that the FAS would furlough some “fully or partially idled” workers as part of cost-cutting measures to balance its budget, the proposed furloughs were ultimately not enacted. During an interview with The Crimson last month, Gay declined to comment on specific cost-cutting measures the FAS is currently pursuing.
During a faculty meeting last fall, FAS Dean for Administration and Finance Leslie A. Kirwan ’79 said that making up the budget deficit may require major, long-term “structural” changes.
For its 2021 Faculty Survey, The Crimson collected electronic responses through Qualtrics, an online survey platform, from Feb. 26 to March 5, 2021. A link to the anonymous survey was sent to 1,182 FAS and SEAS faculty members through emails sourced in February 2021 from Harvard directory information. The pool included individuals on Harvard’s Connections database with FAS affiliations, including tenured, tenure-track, and non-tenure-track faculty.
Of those faculty, 315 accessed the link to the survey. A total of 309 participants answered at least one question, while 235 participants completed every question in the survey.
To prevent participants from accidentally taking the survey more than once, The Crimson enabled Qualtrics’ browser cookie functionality to register unique survey sessions on each device. This device data is controlled by Qualtrics, and The Crimson does not retain information that could identify devices accessing the survey with anonymous responses.
In an effort to check for response bias, The Crimson compared respondent demographics with publicly available information on faculty demographics provided by the University — information regarding gender, minority background, SEAS affiliation, and ladder versus non-ladder status. Overall, respondent demographics tracked with faculty demographics.
Of survey respondents, 38 percent identified themselves as women and 19 percent identified themselves as minorities. Based on data in the 2020 FAS Dean’s Annual report, women and minorities make up 32 percent and 25 percent of FAS ladder faculty, respectively.
According to the report, 41 percent of the FAS were non-ladder faculty — a term synonymous with non-tenure-track faculty. Similarly, 39 percent of respondents to The Crimson’s survey identified themselves as non-ladder faculty.
Of faculty who were sent the link to the survey, 106 — or 9 percent — are affiliated with SEAS. In comparison, of respondents who indicated their divisional affiliation on the survey, 6 percent reported an affiliation with SEAS.

We love HUDS. We really do. But sometimes you want to make yourself a home-cooked meal. Living in a dorm room can make this kind of hard, but my suitemates and I (ok, mainly my suitemates) set out to try to make some nontraditional college student meals. All we needed were a few shopping trips to Berg and Trader Joe’s and our very own micro-fridges. Here are some dishes you could whip up in the comfort of your Harvard dorm room:
Chia Pudding
Chia pudding is a funky breakfast alternative to overnight oats, and it’s pretty simple and very nutritious. You’ll need to mix together chia seeds, honey, and almond/coconut/oat milk (plant-based milk will make the chia pudding creamier) in a mason jar, stir it well and place it in the fridge. Once the mixture is done chilling in the fridge overnight, plop some fresh berries in the jar and enjoy!
Ceviche
Ceviche is fresh fish cooked in citrus juices, and when we made it, it was way tastier than I expected it to be. To make this, you and your suitemates can pop over to TJs, buy some cod, limes, onion, tomato, avocado, and cilantro. Back in your dorm, after cutting up the cod, onion, and tomato into little pieces, pour lots of lime juice over the mixture, add some HUDS salt, and let it sit in the fridge overnight. Once it’s ready, chop up some cilantro and avocado, sprinkle over the fish mixture, and serve the ceviche with some crunchy tortilla chips. This could make for a stand-alone meal or a much-needed snack between classes (perk of online school: you don’t really have to worry about having bad fish breath).
Guacamole
To finish up the tortilla chips and avocados leftover from your ceviche endeavor, you can make some guacamole. Cut up some ripe avocados, tomatoes, red onion, and mix them all together with some lime juice (the amount of lime juice depends on how citrus-y you would like the guacamole to be). After some time in the fridge (make sure to keep the avocado pits in the container with the guac — they keep the mixture fresh!), add some salt to the dip and that’s it!
Mug Cake
This is the perfect snack or dessert option for a movie night. The easiest way to make mug cake would be to purchase a mug cake mix from your local Target and follow the instructions on how to make it in a microwave. Once the cake is cooked, add a scoop (or two or three) of your-choice-of ice cream, some sprinkles, maybe some caramelized nuts, and a drizzle of caramel syrup to your mug cake and cue up that latest Netflix movie.
Pasta
There’s always a risk with making pasta in the microwave, but it’s worth it. To do it, put a handful of pasta in a bowl (avoid spaghetti, that would just get messy) and add enough water to cover the noodles. Then, place a plate over the bowl and put it in the microwave for about five 2-minute intervals. Stir in between and cook until the pasta is al dente. As for toppings, you can go with a jarred tomato sauce or some shredded cheese to add that extra *oomph*.
