After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard students are returning to campus from spring break, University President Drew G. Faust will be taking a break of her own to experience firsthand the work that Harvard students and affiliated institutions have done in Chile and Brazil. Getting the chance to meet with government officials, academics, and other local stakeholders, Faust has the opportunity to shape Harvard’s role as a transformative force in the region. Especially as she makes her journey through Chile, our university’s president will hopefully see both the nation’s progress and continuing struggles and bring back a renewed desire to continue the University’s outreach and build partnerships to promote a more equitable future.
This January, I had the opportunity to volunteer in Chile through the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies’ Language and Public Service Program. Spending time in Santiago, I was able to marvel at the city’s progression, taking in the mix of modern structures, classical architecture, and gorgeous mountain ranges—the view of Santiago most foreigners have become acquainted with. The purpose of the program was to engage with Chile through service by seeing the country through the eyes of those whose view is often never brought to light.
Despite Chile’s position as one of Latin America’s economic powerhouses and reputation for its comparatively higher standards of living, the country is still facing many challenges today. When in Santiago, Faust will see the splendors of advancement and progress, the same sites and development that inspire awe in many visitors. At the same time, however, she must recognize that she is traveling through a metropolis that is segregated by class, and that while marginalized populations may be out of sight, they should not be left out of mind.
Although having experienced severe trauma stemming from a divisive military dictatorship and a sense of terror created by the 2010 earthquake, Chilean culture is built on endurance and solidarity. Faust will not see a people who are weak, but rather a community thirsting for reform and self-sufficiency. As part of this DRCLAS J-term program, I was assigned to work with a construction project in Curnailahue, a small mining community in the south that was caught in the crosshairs of the earthquake’s destruction.  Here I saw a level of poverty that can be most accurately be described by the Spanish word indignante. Homes the size of college suites (but often housing six to eight people) were densely packed along unpaved roads, with neighbors having to share government bathrooms located on an adjoining street. The community residents, for what little they had, opened up their homes to us, even giving me a baseball cap to prevent me and my New England constitution from getting heat stroke, and frequently offering me additional food and telling others to make sure they took care of their “Gringo.”
What I was able to experience in Curanilahue was something truly beautiful: the construction of a foundation. Here was the essence of community.
This embracing spirit of survival is something that I hope Faust is able to observe on her trip. I hope she is able to see that many Chileans are not looking for a handout, but for a hand up and a partner that will enhance the leadership capacity of the residents. By prioritizing programs in the region, like the efforts of DRCLAS, that cultivate local leadership, Harvard has the opportunity to build relationships and construct a future without individuals being defined by circumstances out of their control. Moving beyond the Harvard bubble, Chile offers us only one example of how we can take our education out of the classroom and apply it in a way that has a positive social benefit. We may not necessarily be in a position to pick up a hammer, but we all have the capability to extend the benefits of our university outside of Harvard Yard. By taking this trip, Faust has already recognized this capacity.  I hope that through her journey and observations she can better educate the Harvard community about Chile’s ongoing struggles.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Only at Harvard would drunken revelry and boat burning constitute the highlights of the night preceding one of the most important days of freshman year. River Run is one of many traditions that, although popular and widely practiced, constitute an affront to the College’s policies and philosophy. Recent attempts at cracking down on this activity have involved more than just the administrative board; multiple levels of law enforcement have been called in to prevent students from burning their boats in the Charles River, with threats of detainment and arrest abounding.
Incontestably, drinking in an unfamiliar setting can be dangerous, and burning objects in public can rarely be safe. Beyond the philosophical scope of this issue, Harvard College is legally obligated to prevent underage drinking and boat burning. Nonetheless, these events constitute a valued tradition; Harvard  College would do its students a disservice in abolishing them. The administration should cease its efforts to combat River Run activities directly and instead work to retool current rituals so that they are safer but still engaging.
Two weeks ago, more than a few freshmen entered Houses that they had never stepped foot in before. Beyond partying, River Run provides a singular opportunity to become familiar with one’s potential residence for the next three years. The tradition also represents a key bonding experience for blocking groups that are often composed of people from different social circuits. Neither purpose is served within the existing framework of official pre-Housing day events. The benefits to the Houses themselves are not only external; River Run is a community-building event that brings the often-distant members of a House together. As we have said time and time again, the Houses must work to cultivate a stronger sense of spirit and identity. Only through events such as River Run can this end be accomplished.
Thus, the College should eschew its tack of opposing River Run in its entirety, and should instead allow, encourage, or create alternative traditions that preserve the spirit of current River Run rituals, without the illegality. Fresh Fest, the popular alternative recently introduced, marks an important first step in this direction. However, Fresh Fest ran from only from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m., while River Run is essentially an all-night event; numerous freshmen simply attended both. In that sense, the administration should do more to deal more directly with the aspects of the night that students focus on the most—drinking and boat burning. In lieu of these illegal activities, the administration should offer alternatives, such as a special Stein Club or mini-carnival throughout the night, to provide viable options for students who would otherwise drink.
Going forward, we understand the very real need for the College to protect its students and preserve order. However, we do not merely hope for transparency and honesty in this dialogue—we expect it. We would like to remind the administration that, regardless of its opinion on student conduct, it is dealing with adults, not children. Whatever future the administration envisions for River Run, the needs of the student body must remain relevant, and its input considered.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I am Valerie C. Bradley ’14.  Four years ago, I was in the hospital receiving the last chemotherapy dose to “cure” me of the cancer that had attacked my body. In June 2006, I was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a rare bone cancer, in my left tibia. Expecting to receive a simple diagnosis for my leg pain, my world turned upside down when the doctor used the word “cancer” instead.  Although my grandfather passed away from cancer a few years before, this disease remained abstract to me—I hadn’t expected to be affected personally.
For me, cancer has many meanings. Most prominently, it conjures up memories of the most painful year of my life: a year spent growing progressively sicker from chemo treatments that killed cancer cells but that also caused hair loss, excruciating mouth sores, and endless nausea. Cancer means the end of playing sports and the beginning of chronic leg pain that I’m realizing will never go away. Cancer is the reason why some truly amazing people I’ve been privileged to know are no longer alive.
Although cancer terrifies me, it allowed me to meet some of my best friends whose strength, courage, and optimism continually amaze and inspire me. Because of that, I feel lucky. I am lucky to be alive, to have both legs, and to have friends and family supporting me while I was sick and continuing to do so now.
One cancer friend passed away last semester. Her name was Mary, and she had just turned eight. I was Mary’s first hospital roommate after she was given a terminal diagnosis at age three. Mary and her family fought tooth and nail for four years to give her as much time as possible and pack as much living into what little time she had. When she finally passed away, our only consolation was the end to her pain. While at her wake, looking at her tiny white coffin with ladybugs embroidered inside, all I could think was that coffins should not have to be made that small. That’s why I Relay—so that, one day, they won’t have to be.
I am Elizabeth R. Moroney ’12. If my high school self had been told that I’d take time off from college, I wouldn’t have believed it. In spring 2010, I was an energetic, determined Harvard student who wouldn’t let persistent coughing and some fatigue slow her down.  By June, I was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma.  I had a ten-centimeter chest mass, over ten different prescriptions including twice-daily injections, a blood clot, and an intravenous tube attached semi-permanently to my arm.
Like many Harvard students, I am simply unsatisfied with downtime. Despite initial resistance, I took a leave of absence this fall. I replaced classes with chemo and radiation appointments, and I worried about blood counts and scan results instead of due dates and grades. I’ve had enough radiation to rival nuclear explosions, and enough steroids to be disqualified from the Olympics (without the muscle mass). I learned to be sated by aromatherapy, good movies, chatting online, or walking around the neighborhood.
I had fabulous doctors and nurses and effective drugs, but my preferred medicine is friendship. My hometown friends enlivened my summer, bringing fun to my house, since it was healthier to avoid crowded public places. Medicine time at the Moroney household was full of jokes and encouragement as I guzzled bitter pills and pricked myself with shots. It became a summer of cultural enlightenment, full of all the books, movies, and restaurants that I should have been exposed to but had never had the time to experience. When school began and friends returned to college, my treasured friends in the Harvard Band stepped in, filling my visits with laughter, dancing, and Boston expeditions. Without these friends, cancer would have enveloped my life. But the medicine of friendship reduced cancer to an unpleasant side effect of a generally enjoyable break from school. That’s why I Relay—to diminish cancer’s power by celebrating the power of friendship.
We are this year’s Harvard Relay For Life Survivorship Chairs.  We want to rally survivors and caregivers throughout the Harvard community.  We have learned that cancer is ruthless and pervasive but also that it has the power to bring people together.  We’ve shared our own stories, but we know that there are more.
Relay for Life is the American Cancer Society’s signature fundraiser. The night-long team walkathon honors those affected by cancer and inspires society to fight for an end to this disease. Harvard’s Relay will take place at Gordon Track from 6:00 p.m. on Friday, April 22 to 6:00 a.m. on Saturday, April 23. If you wish to participate in the event, make a donation, or learn more about our cause, visit www.harvardrelay.org.

(A Harvard Professor and Harvard College Student walk into a therapist's office.)
THERAPIST: What brings you in today?
PROFESSOR: Nobody comes to my office hours! I think some students just feel bashful.
THERAPIST: Student, is that true?
STUDENT: Not really. I know a few bashful students, but Harvard isn't a terribly bashful place.
T: Have you attended office hours?
S: No. I guess I just haven't had relevant enough questions. But I invited my favorite Professor to the student-faculty dinner.
T: How did that go?
S: It was awkward, really. The professor I invited was hard to talk to and didn't seem that curious about me.
P: Can I respond? Students seem distant to us, too. They only care about their grades and have no intellectual interest in the material. And given how busy they are, no wonder! Clubs, societies, sports, choirs, orchestras, you name it. They're all doing fifty other things, and class is their last priority.
S: Well, since we're opening up, professors around here make their priorities very clear! Talk about busy! First it's research, grant-writing, and supervising graduate students. After that, they're starting companies and consulting to augment their already generous salaries, appearing on television, and writing books. I pay tuition, and what do I get? Last year's warmed-over lectures and one office hour a week. What a rip.
T: It's clear you're both upset. Let's step back for a minute. Professor, do you feel like there are opportunities to meet students on campus?
P: Definitely! I can eat in the dining halls, attend extracurricular events, join one of the House Senior Common Rooms or even become a House Master. I even heard one professor applied to be a Resident Tutor.
S: (Really? What happened to him?)
P: (Nobody hired him! I think they thought he was a bit crazy.)
T: Professor, have you tried any of these things?
P: No. But nobody cares! I'm up for tenure soon. I have to crank out publications and degrees. I don't get any credit for any of this student contact stuff, everyone knows that! My only interaction with undergraduates that matters is having halfway-decent CUE scores, and as long as I crack a few jokes and grade generously, I'm set. I want to spend more time with College students; it's just not part of my job description.
S: I mean, I want to believe you, but I've had some really inspiring teachers here. David Malan. Tim McCarthy. They seem to be able to do it.
(Professor looks uncomfortable.)
P: Yeah, those guys are great, but they don't do any research and don't have full appointments.
T: Perhaps research is the problem then?
P: No, no! Research is what makes Harvard so great!
S: But I'm trying to get an education. So while you're busy in the lab, I'm learning from my peers, in those clubs, teams, and extracurricular organizations you mentioned earlier.
T: Professor, do you think things will change after you get tenure?
P: Yes! Then I'll be able to completely change the values that have been instilled in me during my first six years here. I'll definitely spend more time with students.
S: C'mon. Isn't after tenure the time when you slow down, spend more time with your family, and start a company on the side?
(The two sit in silence for a minute.)
T: Let me summarize. Professor, you claim you'd like to spend more time with students but that the research orientation of Harvard prevents you from doing so. Student, you feel ignored by the faculty and have responded by building your own community centered on interacting with your peers through extracurricular activities. You're happy for the main part but wonder how much of your tuition is going to fund the community of scholars who seem largely uninterested in you and a growing number of administrators hired to pay attention to you when professors don't.
S: That's a fair assessment.
T: I can't say that this seems like a healthy relationship. I think you two have reached a stable but unhappy cohabitation. Let me make a suggestion.
P: Sure.
T: You two need to decide whether you really want this relationship to work.

Harvard students have claimed 10 of the 30 spots for this year’s Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans, which provide financial assistance to immigrants or children of immigrants who are pursuing graduate studies.
Multiple fellowship recipients said they felt exceptionally lucky and grateful to be afforded the opportunity.
“[The Soros Fellowship] is a wonderful way to highlight the achievements of immigrants and shows how much they have and can contribute to the progress of the nation,” said Harvard Medical School student Melis N. Anahtar, who won the fellowship. “Immigration is beneficial and we need to protect it.”
Stanley J. Heginbotham, co-director at the Soros program, echoed Anahtar’s sentiments and emphasized the importance of helping to advance immigrants in their chosen career paths.
“The fellowship honors the immigrant tradition and promotes the leadership of new Americans in all types of subjects,” Heginbotham said.
He added that Harvard is a “wonderful source” of fellowship recipients every year.
The fellowship looks for students who display creativity, initiative, and originality in any academic field. Heginbotham explained that when selecting recipients, reviewers consider the candidates’ radically different backgrounds, accomplishments, and visions.
Unlike Anahtar, who is the daughter of parents who immigrated from Turkey, recipient Carlos G. Torres is himself an immigrant. Torres, a first year student at the Medical School, moved to the U.S. from Mexico at the age of 10.
He explained that growing up in a new country was challenging in many ways, from being submerged in a completely different culture to not knowing the language. Living in an urban, Latino neighborhood in Milwaukee, Wis. with a lack of role models in professional fields, Torres said he was indirectly motivated to aspire to become a leader and a professional.
“Most importantly, [this fellowship] creates a group of new American leaders from many different fields, giving us all access to such an amazing academic community,” Torres said.
Paul and Daisy Soros, Hungarian immigrants, created the Fellowship for New Americans in 1998 in order to recognize the accomplishment and promise of young new Americans. During the 14 years of its existence, the Soros Fellowship has given 415 awards to students pursuing graduate work and has spent $33 million in support of fellows to date. The award gives its recipients up to $50,000 in cash grants and up to $40,000 in tuition support for two years.

Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business topped U.S. News and World Report’s recently released rankings of the best business schools, pushing Harvard Business School into the number two spot.
Last year, Stanford and Harvard tied for first place, each earning 100 points, while this year Harvard’s score fell to 98 points.
“A two point drop is not what I would call very far,” Business School Director of Media Relations James E. Aisner ’68 said.
According to Garth Saloner, Dean of the Stanford Graduate School of Business, Stanford refrains from using rankings in marketing due to the inherent limitations of a ranking system.
“There are many fine institutions of management education, each with its own merits,” Saloner wrote in an email to The Crimson. “We strongly encourage individual applicants to decide which school best suits them based on their personal values, aspirations, and interests.”
Aisner said that he does not think that prospective students should focus heavily on rankings when choosing which business schools to apply to.
“My hope is that students who are applying to this school are taking a very holistic approach,” Aisner said.
The business school rankings are based on three categories: quality assessment, placement successes, and student selectivity.
The quality assessment score is based on a peer assessment score and a recruiter assessment score ranking each school on a scale of “marginal” (1) to “outstanding” (5).
Aisner said that the rankings are “basically a reputational survey.”
“The Harvards and Stanfords of the world are going to make out well no matter what,” he said.
Harvard Business School Professor Rakesh Khurana, who has conducted research on ranking systems, has also found that rankings reflect a school’s prestige rather than the quality of its instruction.
“The actual rankings don’t matter in reality, but the emergence of the ranking system has been more harmful than helpful to the education system, because schools focus more on their image than they do on the quality of the education that they provide,” Khurana said.
Aisner said that he does not think that the recent turnover of the Business School deanship or the curricular changes announced in January negatively affected the school’s ranking.
Brett Gibson, a second year at the Business School, echoed the positive assessment of HBS in an emailed statement.
“As a student about to graduate from HBS, the experience here has been extraordinary,” Gibson wrote. “I don’t think I could have matched that kind of total experience at any other business school in the world.”
In separate U.S. News and World Report graduate school rankings, Harvard Medical School ranked number one for research, although its primary care ranking was number 15.
Harvard Law School also claimed the runner-up spot behind Yale Law School, which has topped the chart for roughly two decades.
The Harvard Graduate School of Education and the Harvard Kennedy School both tied at number two in the Best Education Schools and Best Public Affairs Schools categories, respectively.
The Graduate School of Engineering and Applied Sciences was tied for number 18 for Best Engineering Schools.

Famed Harvard Medical School Professor Professor Paul Farmer will serve as the 2011 commencement speaker for the John F. Kennedy School of Government, according to an announcement released yesterday.
Farmer—a medical anthropologist and physician—is known for his humanitarian work as one of the co-founders of the international global health non-profit organization Partners in Health.
His work deals with a wide range of topics relating to health in developing areas, including human rights, community health strategies, and socioeconomic inequalities.
“Paul Farmer has been a leader in tackling the immense challenges surrounding global health. His optimistic spirit and ongoing commitment to public service is to be commended and celebrated,” said Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood in the press release. “We look forward to hearing his message to the members of the Harvard Kennedy School’s graduating Class of 2011.”
Both undergraduate and graduate students at Harvard praised the Kennedy School’s decision to invite Farmer.
Lily H. Ostrer ’14—who enrolled in Farmer’s course Societies of the World 25: “Health, Culture, and Community: Case Studies in Global Health” this past fall—called him “one of the most important figures” in the field of global health.
“I think he’s a great choice for a speaker. He is a role model for so many health practitioners and aspiring health practitioners and policy-makers,” Ostrer said.
“He simultaneously advocates for the voiceless around the world and speaks the language of influential policy-makers to help ensure that real and sustainable change is made to save millions of lives,” Ostrer added in an email.
“I’ve never taken a class with Professor Farmer. But I’ve read his books, and I’m impressed with his work,” said Sarah J. Haig, a Kennedy School student, “He adds a lot to the conversation on political health.”
Farmer earned his B.A. From Duke University in 1982 before receiving both his Ph.D. in Anthropology and his M.D. from Harvard in 1990.
He served for ten years as the medical director of a Haitian charity hospital, and is currently serving as an U.N. Deputy Special Envoy to Haiti under Special Envoy Bill Clinton in addition to his other positions.
Partners in Health, which Farmer co-founded in 1987 with Ophelia Dahl, Thomas J. White, Todd McCormack, and Jim Kim, has worked to build comprehensive primary health care systems in impoverished nations ­where access to medical care is limited.
In Dec. 2010, Farmer was named a University Professor—the highest faculty rank at Harvard, held by just 23 professors.
He has written numerous books on global health.

Four experts on Japan expressed confidence in the nation’s ability to recover from recent devastation—wrought by an earthquake and resulting tsunami—in a panel discussion at the Harvard Kennedy School yesterday night.
At the event, entitled “Japan in Crisis: Exploring the Consequences of a Cascading Disaster,” scholars from a number of disciplines discussed the aftermath of the disaster from their own area of expertise.
Michael W. Golay, a professor in the Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering at MIT, addressed the crisis at the Japanese Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant, which experienced a number of equipment malfunctions as a result of the earthquake.
Golay said that a disaster of this size would not even be considered when designing a nuclear plant, as the earthquake was the fifth largest in recorded history.
“One of the important things to note is how rare this event is. The biggest surprise was the occurrence of this earthquake,” he said. “I never thought an event like this would happen in my lifetime.”
Golay added that he believes that the first step in moving forward will be stabilizing the nuclear power plant that was disabled by the crisis. After this, cleanup could take over a decade, he said.
“It was a very complex situation, and it's very easy in hindsight to underestimate the difficulty [those responding to the crisis] were facing,” said Golay.
Shoji Tsuchida, a professor of the Faculty of Safety Science at Kansai University in Japan, focused on the cultural reaction to the disaster among the Japanese public.
Tsuchida said that the disaster reignited the Japanese public’s intense fears of radiation, which stem from the nuclear bombing of Japan in World War II.
He added that the current catastrophe could result in discrimination against residents of the affected regions.
But Tsuchida also focused on Japanese perseverance.
“We have to endure. We have no right to complain because people are suffering more severely than us,” said Tsuchida, referring to the traditional Japanese culture of equality and solidarity.
“We have a strong sense of unity with nature,” Tsuchida added. “We have to accept what nature did because we are part of nature.”
In his remarks, Harvard Kennedy School and Business School Professor Herman B. “Dutch” Leonard emphasized the importance of looking at the natural disaster with a positive perspective.
Leonard compared the earthquake to the disaster in Haiti last year, and noted that while the physical scope of this month’s quake was large, Japan’s preparation resulted in far fewer deaths than might have been expected.
Echoing Tsuchida, Leonard focused on the resilience and ingenuity of the Japanese people.
“I think we’re all going to learn a lot from watching as the Japanese people pick themselves up and move on,” said Leonard. “To me the most powerful lesson will be watching the Japanese people and their patterns of resilience.”

Conservatives are less likely to pursue a Ph.D. than liberals not because of discriminatory hiring practices, but because they perceive academia as a liberal bastion, according to two studies released by Harvard Sociology graduate student Ethan A. Fosse and University of British Columbia associate Sociology professor Neil Gross.
“The idea behind our study is that if you want to explain why academics tend to be on the left, you should focus on who becomes an academic,” said Gross, who formerly taught at Harvard in the Sociology department.
In one study, Fosse and Gross—along with University of British Columbia undergraduate Joseph Ma—used data collected from young American adults over time to determine that liberal college students are more likely to attend graduate school.
In a second audit study, Fosse and Gross worked with with Northwestern Sociology professor Jeremy Freese, sending emails to professors posing as potential graduate students to inquire about doing doctoral work in their departments. In some of the emails, the experimenters mentioned working on either past Democratic or Republican presidential campaigns.
The researchers concluded that professors responded no differently to the prospective graduate students based on their stated political affiliation.
“Our research shows that there’s no direct discrimination against conservatives in the graduate student application process,” said Gross.
The study concludes that liberals disproportionately become professors because they “self-select” academia as a career choice compatible with their political leaning.
Fosse said he hopes the studies will challenge the notion that conservatives are not welcome in academia.
“I would hope that [our research] silences conservative critics who criticize the academy on charges of discrimination and bias against conservative graduate students,” he said.
Government professor Paul E. Peterson criticized the experimental method of the audit study.
“I’m not too impressed with that,” he said. “I don’t think you can draw very heavy conclusions [from] the way people respond [to an email].”
However, Gross said that research into the opportunity structure for discrimination—which suggests that people are more likely to discriminate when they can get away with it—lends credence to the experimental method used in the study.
“If there were biases, they would be more likely to show in these situations rather than [in situations] with colleagues making important decisions about who to admit into a graduate program,” he said.
He added that additional cognitive research shows that bias tends to appear in quick decisions, such as a response to an inquiring email.
Peterson added that he thinks an experiment that investigated the tenure process would more clearly explain the prevalence of liberal professors.
“Just being able to go to graduate school or getting an encouraging letter from a professor is not too much of a barrier to climb,” he said. “But getting a job is a high barrier, and getting tenure is even higher.”

While all of the five largest concentrations at Harvard set their thesis deadline before spring break, seniors in a significant number of smaller concentrations are still hard at work on their cumulative academic papers.
Students in these concentrations face deadlines that fall from this week into April—although at least one concentration sets no official due date at all.
Some faculty members in concentrations with deadlines after spring break said that their departments tried to give seniors as much time to finish their theses as possible.
“Especially in a data-heavy subject like Applied Math, the extra time comes in handy,” said Michael P. Brenner, Area Dean of Applied Mathematics. The Applied Math thesis deadline is April 1.
Along with Applied Math, a number of other heavily quantative concentrations have later thesis deadlines. The Math and Statistics concentrations set their due dates after the break, as do several natural sciences departments, including Physics and Astronomy. But Comparative Religion, Philosophy, and Visual and Environmental Studies also set their senior thesis deadline after the break.
Among seniors in concentrations with due dates after spring break, some said that they appreciated the extra time, while others said they enjoyed the flexibility offered by a later deadline.
Yuga J. Cohler ’11, a Computer Science concentrator, said that, unlike many of his friends in other concentrations, he will be able to finish his thesis without feeling too much pressure.
“The obvious disadvantage is that the vast majority of your friends in the senior class have already finished, and so have more time to hang out, but there’s also the advantage that you feel less rushed,” Cohler said.
Still, he added that he didn’t think deadlines before or after the break were clearly superior to the other.
Other seniors said they appreciated the freedom that comes with a later due date. Rebecca A. Resnick ’11, whose math thesis was due this past Monday, finished it before the break so that she could visit San Francisco without having it hanging over her head.
“[The later deadline] was nice for me, because if I hadn’t finished it, I had a buffer there,” Resnick said. “It gives you more flexibility, because you can finish it before, but if you want the extra time, you have a whole week.”
Chemistry concentrators have even more leeway—the department provides no official deadline for its theses.
Andrew M. Watkins ’11, a Chemistry concentrator, is planning to finish his thesis a week before the deadline for Hoopes Prize submissions. He chose that date for himself, in consultation with his adviser.
Watkins said that he was particularly grateful for the flexibility the department granted him because of the nature of his research. “Sometimes, I’ll spend an eight-hour day in the lab, and I won’t find out for another two days that nothing I did that day accomplished anything,” he said.
Renata C. Cummins ’11, an Earth and Planetary Sciences concentrator, said she was also generally positive toward her concentration’s late due date. She said she felt that it would let her have a relaxing post-thesis senior spring, but that the potential for things to go wrong in the lab made her appreciate the extra time.
Cummins spoke to the Crimson on Monday, however—before she had spent much time with friends who had finished their theses before break.
“If you were interviewing me one week later, I might have a different opinion,” she said. “Maybe next week I’ll be more resentful.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Office of Career Services has recently launched a new fellowship program supporting Harvard seniors who plan to travel purposefully in Europe during the summer after graduation.
The new program, the Henry Russell Shaw Summer Fellowships, will provide five or more seniors with up to $6,000 for three months of travel in Europe. According to the statement of purpose of the Henry Russell Shaw endowment, the fellowship will aim to “supplement [students’] formal education by broadening and cultivating influence which comes from acquaintance with other countries.”
“Part of the idea behind all of these [fellowships] is that you go immerse yourself in a new culture [and] somehow the process of adjusting, learning a new language and new customs, helps you bounce things around inside,” said Paul A. Bohlmann, director of fellowships at OCS.
Bohlmann said the new fellowship will use left-over funds accumulated in previous years from the Henry Russell Shaw Traveling Fellowships, an endowed program that allows students to travel abroad for a full year.
Seniors with no experience living or studying abroad will be given priority in applying.
According to Bohlmann, the new fellowship will not support study programs or internships, given that resources for such purposes are already abundant at Harvard.
Instead, the office hopes to give students who have had little experience with foreign culture the opportunity to travel for reasons of personal importance.
“We don’t care if it’s kind of frivolous or whimsical—we actually think that might be kind of fun. It can also be fairly serious,” Bohlmann said.
Bohlmann told the story of a recipient of the full-year traveling fellowship who travelled around Europe to experience hip-hop scenes in various cities.
“He was making the case that the origin of hip-hop music in the States may have been mostly in the African-American community, but it’s different in London, in Paris, in Munich, where there are different influences coming into play,” Bohlmann said.
According to Bohlmann, this recipient ended up “talking to DJs, rappers, graffiti artists, and all sorts of people on the streets.”
“It sort of satisfied a long lasting interest for him,” Bohlmann added. “I would call it whimsical, which I don’t mean as a judgmental word. It’s just that it has no purpose or reason except for the person and for us who want to support that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The attorney representing Jabrai Jordan Copney—the alleged gunman in the May 2009 Kirkland House shooting—has filed a series of motions that seek to exclude discussion of an alleged prior crime and evidence that the defense says was inappropriately seized by police.
Prosecutors say that Copney and Blayn Jiggetts—an alleged accomplice in the Kirkland killing—stole drugs at gunpoint from two Yale students in New York City in 2008.
Copney’s attorney, John A. Amabile, said he hopes to bar discussion of the alleged New York crime during Copney’s upcoming trial, in which he will be tried for the murder at Harvard of 21-year-old Cambridge resident Justin Cosby.
The defense has filed a motion to dismiss all charges related to the New York robbery, based on the grounds that a Massachusetts court does not have jurisdiction over a crime that occurred in another state, according to Amabile.
The armed robbery in New York served as a blueprint for the drug rip-off, which went tragically wrong, in Kirkland’s J-entryway on May 18, 2009, according to testimony in court documents by individuals with knowledge of both incidents.
Whether or not the New York-related charges are dropped, Amabile is seeking to forbid the robbery from being mentioned as evidence during Copney’s murder trial.
Amabile said that allowing the evidence to be included would prejudice the jury toward seeing Copney as a “bad person.”
The Massachusetts Guide to Evidence states that “evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person.” But such evidence can “be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, ..., intent, preparation, [or] plan.”
Under these guidelines, the prosecution may seek to discuss the New York crime in order to establish that the defendant’s intent upon entering Kirkland’s J-entryway was to steal—rather than buy—drugs from Cosby.
Currently, the prosecution seeks to include charges for both the New York robbery and the shooting in Kirkland House in a single trial. The defense seeks to either dismiss the charges altogether, or—if the motion to dismiss fails—to consider the two incidents in separate trials.
The motion filed by the defense contends that the robbery in New York was a “totally different and unrelated act, transaction, or event” from the Kirkland shooting.
According to Amabile, a judge is also considering whether a jacket found by police in a container in Brittany J. Smith’s closet, which the prosecution contends Copney was wearing at the time of the shooting, is admissible as evidence in the case.
Copney alleged in a motion filed in February that the seized property—which Amabile told The Crimson was the “distinctive jacket” mentioned by witnesses—was not in plain view when police entered the room.
According to court documents, forensic investigators have found gun-shot residue on the jacket.
The defendant’s motion claims that the seizure was “conducted without probable cause, without consent, and without a valid search warrant.”
The search was conducted in Smith’s Lowell House dorm room. Smith, who was a Harvard senior and Copney’s girlfriend at the time of the shooting, has been charged with serving as an accessory after the fact to the murder, among other counts.
Rulings on the admissibility of the jacket and the treatment of the New York crime are likely to be handed down early next week, according to Amabile.
Copney’s trial is scheduled to begin on April 4.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The snow might’ve belied the fact that yesterday was indeed the beginning of spring. And with the new season, much of the focus of the Ivy League sports scene transitions from the rinks and the courts to the fields and the courses. But, we haven’t quite wrapped up all of the winter sports yet, as one Ancient Eight team has some serious work left to do. So let’s kibitz in another edition of Around the Water Cooler.
Of course, the Princeton men’s basketball team went to the Big Dance after beating Harvard in a one-game playoff. Then, the Tigers got a taste of karma in the first round, losing to Kentucky 59-57. While the women’s side didn’t get nearly the same coverage, the Princeton team also punched its ticket to the tournament by winning the Ivy League crown. But once more, the Tigers failed to make it past the opening game, falling to fifth-seed Georgetown, 65-49.
The Ancient Eight didn’t fare much better in the NCAA Women’s Ice Hockey Championship. After second-seed Cornell slaughtered Dartmouth in the quarterfinals, 7-1, third-seed Boston  University dealt the Big Red a resounding 4-1 loss on Friday.
While the men’s tournament has yet to start, Yale has a good chance to take it all for the first time in the school’s history. The one seed, the Bulldogs looked sharp in the ECAC tournament and are 27-6-1 on the year.
But now, on to spring. And already, we’ve had some exciting action.
This past weekend marked the beginning of Ivy League competition in men’s lacrosse. In the weekend’s biggest upset, No. 18 Penn trounced No. 11 Princeton, 8-3, marking the Quakers’ first victory over the Tigers since 1989. Princeton just couldn’t get anything going all game, thanks in large part to the play of Penn freshman defender Maxx Meyer, who earned Ivy League Rookie of the Week for his performance.
And the world of women’s lacrosse witnessed an upset of its own, as Cornell beat No. 14 Notre Dame in double OT, 6-5.
Penn continues to hold the upper hand in Ivy League women’s lacrosse, earning its 31st straight conference win after defeating Yale, 7-2, on Saturday.
While the baseball teams of the Ancient Eight have yet to meet, the Big Green have a pretty good shot to win it all for the third year in a row. With a pretty young team last year, Dartmouth returns many top players, including Kyle Hendricks who fanned 15 batters in seven innings last Friday against Army. No Dartmouth hurler has gotten that many K’s since Nixon was president.
If Harvard wants to knock off Dartmouth, the team has a lot of work to do after starting the season with a dismal 1-13 record.

Though football season passed months ago, the Harvard football team’s work is still not done. In addition to bruising and beating down its opponents on the field, the team also works hard for the community. This Friday, March 25th, the team will be holding a blood drive to help the American Red Cross with its efforts to save those in need.
From 1-6 p.m., at the Dillon Field House 2nd Floor Lounge, the team will be on hand to help the phlebotomists draw blood from generous individuals. Every semester the team performs a service event, and this semester’s is a noble cause. Giving blood helps save lives.
“It’s something we do every year, one of our community service projects,” junior quarterback Collier Winters said. “We take pride in hosting the blood drive. We promote it throughout the week and then on Friday we have guys walk around campus in jerseys.  [It’s great to] hopefully help some one who’s in need of blood and do our part. It’s a good team bonding activity…We get to take part in something meaningful. It’s great thing to be able to help out the organization.”
These reasons should be enough to convince everyone in the community, Boston, Cambridge, and Harvard, to trek to the athletic complex and make a difference while supporting the team’s efforts.
Appointments can be made through the Red Cross website, or individuals can simply show up and donate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jennifer Botterill ’02-’03’s career with the Canadian national women’s hockey team left nothing to be desired. After earning three Olympic gold medals, five world championships, and two world championship MVP awards, the Winnipeg, Manitoba native announced her retirement from the national team on Monday, March 14.
“I feel like I’ve been fortunate enough to play at the elite level for quite some time,” Botterill says. “I’m at a stage in my life where I’m looking forward to some other things as well. It just felt right for me.”
Botterill’s Olympic career came to a fitting conclusion on Feb. 25, 2010 when she assisted on Marie-Philip Poulin’s gold-medal winning goal.
Botterill began her habit of winning championships during her days at Bright Hockey Center. As a freshman, she scored the game-winning goal in Harvard’s 6-5 overtime win over the University of New Hampshire off an assist from co-captain A.J. Mleczko '98-’99—giving the Crimson its first and only national title.
“She’s scored unbelievably big goals when we needed them,” Harvard coach Katey Stone says. “She had just a fantastic career.”
Botterill followed Mleczko’s lead in another way—by winning the Patty Kazmaier Award as the nation’s best female collegiate hockey player in 2001, two years after her teammate. Botterill won the award again in 2003, making her the only athlete to take home two Kazmaier trophies.
“I really loved my time at school,” Botterill reflects. “I think that I learned a lot in my playing career at Harvard.”
In 2002, Botterill took a break from winning Kazmaier Awards to win something bigger: her first Olympic gold medal. At the Nagano Olympics in 1998, 18-year-old Botterill and the Canadian national team took silver to a United States team which featured two of Botterill’s future Crimson teammates: Mleczko and Angela Ruggiero '02-’04. But four years later in Salt Lake City, Botterill and the Canadians exacted revenge on the Americans’ home soil. Though the U.S. and the Canadians have traded world championships, the Canadians haven’t lost a gold-medal game in the Olympics since.
“I feel our rivalry with the U.S. has always been very competitive,” she says. “As a team, we’ve been able to bring our best performance at the Olympics.”
But Botterill says that breaking the hearts of her former Harvard teammates hasn’t interfered with their friendship off the ice.
“I feel like that was certainly a good experience,” Botterill says of playing with American Olympians Mleczko, Ruggiero, Jamie Hagerman ’03, and Julie Chu '06-’07, during college. “It added a healthy element ... we’ve become very good friends. When you’re competing and playing against them, it’s still intense. We also realize that we’re still really good friends with them off the ice.”
Because of Botterill’s attachment to the Crimson, it was fitting that she return to Bright the weekend before her retirement. Botterill and her Canadian Women’s Hockey League team, Toronto, defeated Boston in a playoff matchup to earn the team a spot in the Clarkson Cup, the Stanley Cup of women’s hockey.
“It’s an exciting time for our team,” says Jenny Brine '09, Botterill’s teammate in Toronto.
Botterill has not announced whether she is retiring from the CWHL or only from the national team. But even if the forward chooses to move on from her playing days, she will hardly be settling down. In addition to her on-ice exploits, Botterill has been working in broadcasting as a host for Gretzky.com and has recently taken up speaking at events. She is also active with several charities, including Right to Play, EatSmartOntario.ca, Special Olympics, Kidsport, Children’s Wish Society, and Canadian Cancer Society.
And Botterill’s performances on the ice won’t be forgotten anytime soon. Eight years after her graduation, her career record of 340 collegiate points has yet to be broken.
“Right from my freshman year, Coach used her as an example of what to strive for: hard working, giving her summers to improving whatever she needed, character player, sportsmanship, and great leadership among her teammates,” Brine recalls.
“She’s a tremendous ambassador for the game,” Stone adds.
As her career with the Canadian national team—the third longest in the program’s history—comes to a close, Botterill can leave the national team fully confident in her position as one of the greatest women’s hockey players of all time.
“She’s done everything,” Stone says. “I’m so happy for her that she decided to retire. I don’t think she has anything else to accomplish or to prove ... She can retire knowing that she’s reached the apex of her sport.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Living legend Tommy Lasorda once said that “there are three types of baseball players: those who make it happen, those who watch it happen, and those who wonder what happens.” Senior quarterback-turned-pitcher Andrew Hatch is undoubtedly a part of the first group.
Just when all seemed said and done after a concussion hastened the end of his football career, Hatch made an interesting and unpredictable step: exchanging his football helmet for a baseball cap and walking on to the Harvard baseball team (1-13, 0-0 Ivy) in the spring of his senior year.
“I wanted to challenge myself, to see if I could really still play,” Hatch said. “I always loved baseball. It was the sport I picked up first, and the team looked like a great thing to be a part of.”
Hatch hasn’t competed on the diamond since his senior year as a pitcher for the Cimarron-Memorial High School Spartans.
“Getting back into baseball was hard work,” Hatch said. “I got going with a few workouts over break before starting the spring semester with the team. I really pushed myself to try to get a spot and help the program be successful.”
Coach Joe Walsh was so impressed by Hatch’s handle on the game that he overlooked his six year hiatus and offered him a spot on the roster.
“I’d known about him for some time through old coaches,” Walsh said. “But when he came out, I was still impressed. He worked on all aspects of the game: pitching, batting, defense. We couldn’t wait to see what he’d look like in early April.”
Cimarron-Memorial High School baseball coach Mike Hubel isn’t surprised by Hatch’s ability to pick up the game.
“Andrew is a superb athlete,” Hubel said. “He pitched in some of our most crucial games and was very successful. His work ethic is phenomenal, and when he puts his mind to becoming good at something, he has the athletic ability to be good.”
In 2005, when he was last on the diamond, the Cimmaron-Memorial Spartans were ranked No. 48 nationally coming into the season, and Hatch earned second-team all conference honors as a pitcher.
“He started off a little slow, which was expected because he hadn’t played in a while, but by mid-season, about 10 or so games, he was deadly on the diamond,” Hubel said.
Yet, on a team where at least 18 people can pitch, and twice as many vie for outfield spots, Hatch’s impact on this squad has been limited. The senior has played only eight games in the field and two on the mound in Harvard’s 14 outings.
So far, Hatch’s foray into baseball has helped the struggling Crimson put up a fight, accounting for a run, four hits, and three RBIs in a tough 8-4 loss at Jacksonville State on March 4, and a ninth-inning score in the Crimson’s last matchup against Charlotte last Sunday.
“He’s definitely wowed everyone,” freshman infielder Carlton Bailey said. “He went 4-for-4 in his first time up this season and didn’t fail to impress.”
Never one for complacency, the senior football standout continues to look for ways to expand his impact on the team.
“The coaches and players have all really helped me get things going quickly, but I’m still looking to progress from here,” Hatch said. “I want to contribute whatever I can to the team, hopefully start getting some wins this weekend and really push everyone to their potential come Ivy League play.”
Off the field, his effect on his teammates has been noticed by players and coaches alike.
“It’s crazy to think that a BCS national champion is playing alongside you every day,” Bailey said. “He’s great guy, he leads by example, and he’s definitely an inspiration for all the guys on the team.”
Interestingly enough, “inspiration” is also a word Walsh found fitting when describing his new pitcher and outfielder.
“He’s got a quiet demeanor about him, but he’s a hard working guy with a real desire to compete as a college athlete,” Walsh said. “If you’ve got a passion for baseball, it’s a hard thing to give up, and that’s one thing he shows for sure. Now that’s an inspiration.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON, Mass.—After road trips to Florida and California, Harvard softball may have been spoiled by warmer spring climates over spring break.
The team’s return to Massachusetts was hardly comfortable. Taking on Boston University in their annual cross-river matchup, the teams battled both cold weather and harsh winds at BU Softball Field, and Harvard (9-8) was forced to adjust to softball back in the Northeast.
But it didn’t miss a beat, coming out victorious over the Terriers in a close 2-1 victory yesterday afternoon.
The Crimson was able to jump on BU early after junior infielder Whitney Shaw drove in Stephanie Regan with an infield single.
But though Harvard got eight hits throughout the game, it struggled to put them together after the first, stranding eight runners on base over the course of the afternoon.
“That’s been our struggle and is our focus for the next week and a half and continuing through the season,” Allard said. “We’re hitting the ball well, we’re swinging at good pitches, [and] we’re having quality at bats, but we just need to figure out a lineup that is going to score a ton of runs.”
In the meantime freshman Laura Ricciardone was keeping the Terrier hitters in check.
Ricciardone pitched three scoreless innings before allowing BU to score its only run of the game in the fourth inning. The tying run came when junior Kayla Kruper scored off a ground out by freshman Megan Volpano to bring BU even.  Kruper had pinch ran for teammate Brittany Clendenny, whom Ricciardone had walked.
The Terriers threatened in the third inning and again in the fourth, but freshman third baseman Kasey Lange prevented the potential go-ahead runs.
In the third, with one out and a runner 60 feet away, Lange fielded a ground ball and decided to throw home for the out rather than get the easier force out at first.
“I heard the third base coach tell the girl to go, so I just thought instantly to throw home because I knew [the run] would tie the game,” Lange said.
During the fourth inning, after the Terriers scored on a ground out, the Crimson caught BU freshman Amy Ekart in a rundown between third and home.
As Ekart broke for home, Lange ran her down and leaped to tag her right before she could score.
“I knew that she was the go-ahead run, and we didn’t want to fall behind, so I went after her,” Lange said. “I knew she was faster than me, so I dove at her to make the tag.”
It was Lange that came up big for the Crimson once again, this time with her bat.
In the fifth inning, she laced a triple down the right-field line that scored captain infielder Ellen Macadam to give Harvard the lead for good.
“Their pitcher had been pitching me outside pitches the whole game, and she finally gave me an inside pitch, so I just turned on it,” Lange said.
In the bottom of the same inning, Allard put her ace, junior pitcher Rachel Brown, on the mound for the three-inning save.
Brown not only kept the Terriers from scoring but also didn’t allow a single runner to reach base.
In the three innings that she pitched, she baffled hitters, recording seven strikeouts for the Crimson, and finished the game by striking out the side in the seventh inning.
Crimson coach Jenny Allard and her staff decided to mix up the team’s game-plan and placed two pitchers on the mound against the Terriers.
“That was one of the few games we have really had [Ricciardone and Brown] combine together,” Allard said. “I thought it was great that BU had not seen Laura in the fall, so we wanted to give her the start and have Rachel close.”
The duo of Ricciardone and Brown combined for 10 strikeouts in seven innings.
“The pitchers did a really good job,” Allard said. “We wanted to give them both work heading into the weekend, and because the forecast for Thursday doesn’t look great, we wanted to keep everyone fresh rather than one person shouldering the load.
The cold weather and erratic conditions haven’t kept Harvard from preparing for the all-important Ivy League play that starts late next week.
“Over this next week and a half before our conference starts, we figure some [non-conference games] are going to get cancelled, and we have to figure out how to play in the colder weather,” said Allard. “[The team] really did a good job. They really kept their hands warm and stepped up, which was really good to see before this weekend.”

The fight against cancer is underway at Harvard once again this year as Relay for Life, an annual event that raises money for the American Cancer Society, picks up steam on campus.
During the months leading up to Relay for Life, participants collect donations, often in creative ways such as bake sales or benefit concerts.  This fundraising culminates in a night-long event, which includes games, entertainment, and other festivities as participants take turns walking around a track or field in order to celebrate the fight against cancer and those who have survived the disease.
This year Harvard is hosting its very own relay, instead of collaborating with other universities as it has in the past.  Harvard students can break into groups  based on dorms, clubs, or other affilliations to raise money for the American Cancer Society.  This year is considered to be an especially important year to directors of the event because it is the first year Harvard has hosted its own event.
"We really want to set a high bar for future years," said Co-Director of Harvard Relay for Life Mackenzie J. Lowry '11, who encouraged students to join the event citing it as an incredible experience.
"There's a lot of fun and entertainment," Lowry said. "Last year we broke the Guiness world record for number of simultaneous fist-bumps."
Organizers of the events encouraged students to either join a team or create their own, stressing that it was an achievable task for anyone.
"It's super easy and takes no time at all," said Thayer Team Leader Katerina Glyptis '14.
The event also holds a deep emotional purpose for many of the participants. "Everyone has a different reason to walk," Glyptis said.
Lowry agreed, saying that it was the death of her father to cancer in high school as well as losing a classmate to cancer in college that motivates her to walk. "Everyone knows someone, or knows someone who knows someone [affected by cancer]" Lowry said.
158 people are currently participating and Relay for Life has raised $8,586.00 at Harvard so far. Interested students are encouraged to check out the Harvard Relay for Life website.

Tonight the "HappyNest" on the third floor of the SOCH will celebrate its first opening at 8 p.m.
The HappyNest will be the permanent drop-in center for Harvard's Happiness Project, which is a student run organization that seeks to promote well-being in order to increase happiness and decrease stress.The opening will provide students with access to different video games like Xbox and Wii, art supplies, board games, and mini golf. The event will also include free pizza and burritos, as well as massages from Stressbusters. As an added bonus, students will receive their own container of silly putty.
Leslie R. Rith-Najarian '12, the founder of the Happiness Project, was fascinated by the human reception of stress after working in psychology Professor Daniel T. Gilbert's lab last semester. This interest not only sparked a thesis topic, but also inspired her desire to promote a less stressful lifestyle for students here at Harvard.
"Though playing may not directly bring happiness to all people, the purpose of the HappyNest and the atmosphere it creates is to promote the idea of taking a little time for ourselves," Rith-Najarian said.
Happiness Project staff member Eva M. Williams '13 explained her excitement about promoting happiness on campus and the opening of a happiness center.
"To me I think it's really important that people maintain some kind of sanity. To most people here work is the most important thing. But in my option, work is not the most important thing, but happiness is, because if you're not happy, what's the point?" Williams said.

The Harlem Globetrotters, a family-friendly exhibitionist basketball team, came to the Malkin Athletic Center on Monday to educate schoolchildren on character. If you happened to have been at the gym between 1 p.m. and 2:30 p.m., you may have seen a handful of members from the team gracing the basketball courts.
Seven members of the well-known team taught their celebrated "C.H.E.E.R. For Character" program to roughly 150 students from the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. School in Cambridge. As the "Ambassadors of Goodwill," the Globetrotters designed the C.H.E.E.R. program with assistance from the U.S. Department of Education.
The program is both educational and engaging—by teaching the importance of Cooperation, Healthy mind and body, Effort, Enthusiasm, and Responsibility (C.H.E.E.R) while integrating basketball tricks and games—the team creates a fun and exciting learning environment for students in selected schools across the nation.
The team is in town for its "4 Times the Fun" tour at Boston's TD Garden this Saturday and Sunday, March 26-27.
