After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you’ve ever wondered what the “Odyssey” would look like if the Sirens sang Beyoncé and cooked Annenberg-style red-spiced human, “Carrie and Otis” is for you. Running in the Adams Pool Theater from Oct. 23 to Oct. 26 and directed by Megan G. Jones ’16, the student-written play by Mike C. Ross ’16 tells the story of three Siren sisters named Carrie (Rachel C. Talamo ’18), Lorelei (Taylor L. Vandick ’16), and Marilyn (Madison M. Dildine ’16). Carrie, a teenager in spirit despite being hundreds of years old, enters a stage of angst-ridden existentialism and starts to wonder what it would be like to get to know the men her sisters lure to their island instead of eating them for dinner. When Otis (Adam S. Wong ’17), a handsome young man who likes the same kinds of music as Carrie, shows up, she gets her wish. Obviously, though, their relationship gets complicated: there are reasons why ancient, mythical monsters don’t usually date.
The Pool has a small, relaxed feel to it, and this is a small, relaxed kind of play. It didn't try to be thematically grand or artistically ground-breaking; instead, it tried to be sweet, pithy, funny, interesting, and generally fun. And it succeeded. The play easily fused “Zoolander” references with Greek tradition, and the contemporary sensibilities gave it a nice sharpness while the myth created a fun source of suspense for those familiar with the “Odyssey.” Waiting to find out which figure in the epic poem was Otis or Lorelai represented is half the fun of watching the play.
Even the set design itself worked cleverly with the Siren myth. According to the Greeks, the Sirens lived on sharp rocks into which they lured ships. The set (Kate A. Farineau ’16) included these cliffs, reminding the audience of the play’s mythical inspiration. Putting an entire set of cliffs on a very small stage might have been a difficult challenge, but Farineau succeeded admirably: it consisted mainly of large, painted rocks that symmetrically framed the stage and shrunk in size as they neared the audience. The placement of the rocks suggested that if the audience were to approach the stage, they too—like the ships—might face a collision. These set design choices created nifty, easily accessible off-stage spaces, as well as opportunities for enclosed, seemingly indoor spots.
The lighting (Joey R. Longstreet ’16), mostly unobtrusive, also allowed the rocks to cast large shadows on the back wall and further expanded the set. Otherwise, set pieces were mostly small, fun, sea-related objects: oars, a kiddie pool filled with blue confetti, small shells, subtly blue lighting. The restored pool element of the theater also contributed connotations of water to fun effect. The overall idea of combined myth and gentle playfulness fitted the play well.
The play’s tone was equally well-integrated; it seamlessly mixed sweetly awkward romance, music, drama, and witty meta-humor. When the play became a little more serious towards the end, it felt necessary and thoughtful rather than dark or unexpectedly tragic.
Much of the play’s success could also be attributed to the strong cast. Talamo presented Carrie as a smart, likable every-girl, and Wong gave Otis an easy charm and humor. The two had good chemistry, but they were still ultimately overshadowed a little by the other, more distinctive characters. Vandick gave Lorelei an interesting maturity and gravity, and Joe B. Palana ’17—who, in an inspired casting choice, played each successive doomed sailor—worked with hilarious, open-mouthed awe. And Dildine overshadowed everyone as Marilyn. With flawless comedic timing, she made Marilyn bubbly and cheerfully vapid while showing a touching earnestness. Her humor and charisma together took over the stage, particularly in one instance when she discovered the definition of Siren in a sailor’s book. Proclaiming that she was now smart because she wore glasses, Dildine made Marilyn’s pride in demonstrating her newfound knowledge both endearing and funny.
The actors also pulled off the play’s musical elements nicely. There was no traditional showtunes, but the characters did sing short snippets of songs when the plot calls for it. The female leads’ voices moved together particularly beautifully, nailing songs that ranged from the traditional to the contemporary. Dildine had a great, belt-y voice that fitted her character well, and Talamo’s voice was a pretty, soft, breathy quality. Occasionally, it verged on being a little too light, but the overall effect was successful. Incidentally, Wong was also a gifted whistler, putting a layer of frosting on the already tasty cake that is “Carrie and Otis.”
Humorous, thoughtful, and clever, the play iwas well worth a trip to Adams House’s basement. Come for the Gilmore Girls references; stay for an example of original and very well-done playmaking.

A senior thesis project involving the labeling of foods based on nutritional value came under fire recently as members of the Eating Concerns Hotline and Outreach (ECHO) program voiced concerns about its effects on those suffering or recovering from eating disorders. The so-called “traffic light” system—foods are designated as red, yellow, or green on the basis of healthfulness—had previously been tested at Massachusetts General Hospital, where sales of red-label items decreased by 20% and sales of green-labeled items increased by 12% over a period of two years.
At Harvard, a similar behavioral economics-inspired program has been put into practice in the Mather and Dunster House dining halls with the aim of understanding how students’ eating habits will be affected. Labels have been affixed to everything from prepared foods to soft drink machines, accompanied by explanatory charts containing information designed to help students achieve balanced diets by eating a certain amount of food in each color group.
Efforts to increase awareness of the nutritional value of food at Harvard are certainly worthwhile and should be expanded. There is currently a paucity of detailed nutritional information displayed in the dining halls, forcing students to plan their meals online in order to access even basic information about calories, fat content, and nutrients. Harvard's dining halls could benefit from the health-minded innovation behind the current trial program.
That said, the traffic light system seems overly simplistic. Colored dots do little more than label certain foods as “good” or “bad” while failing to capture the nuances of a healthy diet. While the program does acknowledge the need to consume a blend of red, yellow, and green foods, there is more to nutrition than simply consuming unhealthy foods in moderation. Certain green-label foods are better than others from the standpoint of nutrition, and many red-label foods could be seen as a parts of a healthy diet. Simply put, traffic lights do not allow students to fully comprehend how to best nourish their bodies and minds and could distract from other important aspects of healthy eating. As members of ECHO and others have suggested, that bluntness may exact a particularly heavy toll on students with, or recovering from, eating concerns.
A better solution would be to display an abridged nutrition facts graphic alongside each food, accompanied by charts explaining basic nutritional information such as the calorie needs of different individuals and the essential nutrients that should be present in a healthy diet. A simple yet more informative system would better help students plan their meal decisions as well as understand the nutrition science behind them.

With less than one week to go, the Massachusetts gubernatorial election between Martha Coakley and Charlie Baker could hardly be closer. A recent WBUR poll found that the two most important issues to voters are “making state government function better” and “making higher education more affordable in Massachusetts.” Among voters who care most about getting more bang for their tuition buck, Coakley leads Baker by 19 points. College costs, and whether Coakley can capitalize on her advantage there, could decide the election.
It is no wonder Bay Staters worry about skyrocketing costs of college. Our national economic crisis, coupled with the trillion-dollar-plus tuition-debt crisis, is weighing down a generation and threatening our future.
Both gubernatorial candidates promote policies to make college more affordable. Baker calls for lowering costs through online learning, three-year degree programs, and increasing job opportunities by enhancing connections between schools and employers. Coakley proposes a full-need financial aid policy for qualified students at state community colleges and a $5,000 tax deduction for families making contributions to the Massachusetts 529 college savings plan.
Both proposals might help. But both ignore the single most significant driver of crushing student debt: the failure to protect students from the false promises of some for-profit schools. All higher education needs reform, but many of the worst practices—including outright fraud—have been concentrated in the for-profit sector.
As Attorney General, Coakley issued new state consumer protection regulations specific to for-profit schools and sued some for-profits. Those efforts were a good first step, but unlike other consumer protection laws, those regulations are not enforceable by individual students. Schools force students to sign arbitration agreements as part of enrollment, leaving them unable to sue to enforce their rights.
To understand the appeal and danger of for-profits, one need only consider the marketing that consumes huge portions of their budgets.  The basic message is clear: our college is the path to animating and fulfilling your aspirations. A DeVry TV ad asks: “Ready for a great career?” ITT Tech promises an “education for the future.” Kaplan College allows students to “take control” of their lives. Everest College encourages prospective students to “start on the road to a rewarding career and a better life.” And Argosy University assures students: “We’re going to work together, and you’re going to come to understand that you can do this.” While that same message comes in several flavors, this same sweetener is always sprinkled on top: “Financial aid available to those who qualify.” In short, we will deliver your dreams; all you have to do is accept a loan.
That is the game. For-profit schools routinely use aggressive and sometimes abusive recruiting practices to encourage low-income students to take out federal educational loans, which are virtually impossible to discharge in bankruptcy. Schools have only to comply with minimal federal regulations to be eligible to receive this taxpayer-financed debt. While some for-profits offer reputable programs, too many exploit the system, taking in this risk-free money, raking in profits, and providing little in return.
The results are as predictable as they are tragic: Studies show that graduates of for-profit colleges are no better equipped to land a job, much less repay their new loans, than are high school graduates. More students are taking on more debt for a less valuable education. And while students at for-profit schools account for about 13 percent of college enrollments, those same students account for half of all student loan defaults. Colleges should not be able to take what they claim to be providing: their students’ futures.
Both candidates should take a decisive stand on this important issue. The entire Commonwealth suffers when its young people are caught in this student debt trap, unable to sue to assert their rights, unable to repay (or discharge) their loans, unable to invest in our shared economy, and unable to fashion a promising future. This generation is being victimized by educational charlatans and shortsighted policymakers. We owe them more than just more debt. We owe them a fighting chance.

On Monday, the Boston Globe endorsed moderate Republican Charlie Baker for governor, and, like many Globe readers, my first thought was something along the lines of, “What the hell?”
The last time the Hub’s paper endorsed a Republican for governor I wasn’t old enough to talk. It was 1994, and Bill Weld, an old-line "New England Republican," got the nod against Democrat Mark Roosevelt. On close elections, the paper splits left, even to the left of the state’s liberal populace: the Globe endorsed firebrand Elizabeth Warren in 2012, Shannon O’Brien against Romney in 2002, and Deval Patrick against Baker in another close race eight years ago.
This is all to say that the paper’s endorsement Monday is a pretty big deal. And it certainly isn’t the norm.
How, I’m asking myself, did this happen? In June, Martha Coakley had a 16-point lead, in September the gap still wasn’t trivial, and the race seemed to be another ceremonial victory parade for the Democrat, as is custom in the Bay State. What makes Baker so special? And why is Coakley an unattractive option for so many liberals?
These questions are important because they have profound implications for the state’s governing establishment and for moderate Republicans, in New England and throughout the country.
To answer them, let’s first look at Baker, who’s come off, over the past few months, as profoundly reasonable.
Yes, he’s a Republican, but almost anywhere else, he’s a Democrat. He believes in anthropogenic climate change, plans to raise the state’s environmental budget, and at least kind of opposes new gas pipelines entering the state. He’s pro-choice, he supports gay marriage, he supports an assault weapons ban, and publicly, he’s a supporter of federal immigration reform. So his views, for many voters, aren’t all that off the mark, and politically, he might represent a lot of centrist Democrats better than his opponent.
But the race isn’t just a referendum on the candidates’ beliefs; it’s also a referendum on the governing culture of Beacon Hill.
It’d be a mistake to condemn the place as a festering pit of corruption and cronyism; it’s not Tallahassee or Albany, and it usually ranks toward the middle in terms of transparency. Yet like any one party state—(90 percent of the House and Senate is Democratic)—lethargy and a lack of competition can and has led to excess, no matter one’s political view.  In 2010, a report by the Globe cataloged a massive cronyism scheme in the parole department during which hundreds of unqualified employees were hired. That paper, despite its liberal leaning, has an entire online section dedicated to pension abuse.
Current governor Patrick himself has hired neighbors for lucrative, do-nothing jobs, and after a series of plush, seemingly frivolous improvements—such as the acquisition of a Cadillac via state funds in 2010—he came to be known as Gov. "Deville," rather than Deval for a short time. Just a few days ago, he quietly moved 500 state managers to a program in which none could be fired, and all would be guaranteed annual raises, presumably to protect them should Baker be elected.
This is all a terrible disappointment to many of us because a lot of Bay Staters have a social democratic vision for the state, and in most ways this vision succeeds. But it requires us to put a lot of trust in Beacon Hill and the Democratic Party, and sometimes that trust is betrayed.
As the attorney general who has found herself tangled up in scandals of her own—and as an establishmentarian who’s anything but a firebrand on the campaign trail—it’s hard not to associate Martha Coakley with the Beacon Hill clique. She’s decidedly not an Elizabeth Warren—the bold outsider with new ideas, a new populist rhetoric, and a small government agency already to her name—who managed to kick out a popular incumbent in the senate.
Where Baker is driving the wedge is not between conservatives and liberals in Massachusetts; he’d lose if he did that. Rather, he’s driving a wedge between liberals who want something bold, new and pure and don’t see it coming from Beacon Hill, and those that are merely annoyed, but not so much so as to break the party ranks.
Now, I’m personally not sold on Baker, mainly because his rhetoric often isn’t backed up by policy.
Whereas Coakley has put forth specific green benchmarks and initiatives, Baker’s environmental plans seem so far confined to “encouraging the private sector.”
And while Coakley has plans to accommodate undocumented immigrants in Massachusetts, through methods like opposing the Trust Act, Baker is quite regressive at the state level.
The list goes on.
But like many, I’m also not sold on Coakley, who comes of as an insider, a “forgone conclusion,” without a critical eye for the government she’ll be presiding over. I guess in the end the lesson for Democrats in the state is this: Give us an outsider, someone charismatic, with fresh initiatives, and who’s free of the baggage of Beacon Hill.
Either that, or give us fewer reasons to view the Hill with suspicion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hello dear readers (mother)! Ordinarily, I’d take this time to talk to you about the Undergraduate Council, or CS50, or whatever happened to show up on my Facebook feed the night before my columns run. I might even take some time to mention Larry Summers or the Winklevi. Today, though, I’d prefer to talk about politics. Of course, it’s more like a monologue or soliloquy than a conversation, but I still like to think of myself as a man of the people.
After all, I’ve spent the better part of this weekend agonizing and debating, listening to and watching two other men of the people. You see, I have a Florida absentee ballot sitting on my desk, and have absolutely no idea whom to vote for as our next governor.
If you are not a resident of Florida, please give yourself a pat on the back, smirk condescendingly, and kindly excuse yourself. This column is dedicated to the folks in the only state in the union where hearing aids outnumber cell phones (not actually true but you believed it), where mahjong sets and domino tiles are more popular than our baseball teams (probably true, but the stats are hard to find), and where the first zombie was spotted (definitely true), leading our brave state congressmen to propose legislation to prepare for the impending flesh-eating apocalypse (I could not possibly make that up).
We, fellow Floridians, have outdone ourselves yet again. Never in my life have I seen a campaign like this. Our Democratic option is Charlie Crist, a man with a complexion somewhere between that of John Boehner and a Spalding basketball. His political stances, mind you, have changed so dramatically that even John Kerry got whiplash watching Crist campaign. Crist will tell anyone who listens that the Republican Party became too radical and extreme for him at precisely the same moment he started slipping the polls to Marco Rubio four years ago. If you believe that, I have a time share in the Everglades to sell to you.
Our other option, though, is Rick Scott, a man who once managed to scam Medicare out of hundreds of millions of dollars, and yet is woefully incapable of obtaining a prescription for Rogaine. He bears an odd resemblance to both Steve Buscemi and Voldemort, and in 2010 spent nearly $75 million of his own money to beat an unpopular democratic candidate by a whopping one percent of the vote. And so our election on Monday is basically a race between Bert and Ernie, if Ernie got an extra spray tan and Bert were secretly a bald, creepy, bug-eyed version of a dark wizard. The most amazing part of this election is, of course, that both of these men have already served as our governor.
I really had no idea which one of the two to vote for, so I decided to watch the debate. Those who tuned in witnessed the equivalent of a middle school pissing match. At first, neither would take the stage. Governor Crist finally strode on, but we were quickly informed that he was cheating! You see, the rules clearly stated that no electronic devices were allowed to be used. Crist, however, had a fan placed under the podium pointing up at him. I don’t mean a fan like Bill Clinton used to have in Monica, I mean a fan that blows air. Air, I said. Come on, people, stay with me here.
Many of us viewers were left wondering why Governor Crist was so insistent on a fan. Apparently, the man needs his balls chilled. Maybe Crist had recently switched from boxers to briefs, to keep it all in, you know, but was getting a little stuffy down there and needed to air out. Maybe he was trying to cool himself after a particularly grueling day in the tanning salon. I don’t know, and it would be irresponsible of me as a journalist to speculate further.
Of course, he might be irradiated, and only a constant cooling effect keeps him from spontaneously combusting. But again, I won’t speculate.
After an uncomfortable minute where we, the viewers, were left alone with Crist, Governor Scott finally joined him on stage. At that point, I must confess, I stopped paying attention and started watching a Looney Tunes rerun. It bore more resemblance to real life.
I was not happy, agonizing over the choice before me. But then I took a look around and realized that we’re no more screwed than the rest of the country. The whole nation is still trying to figure out how to get back to some semblance of full employment, what exactly the difference is between “deficit” and “debt,” and who is supposed to pay for our health care, because it’s sure as hell not us. In the meantime, Social Security and Medicare are bigger businesses than ever before, and in the run-up to this election, it’s we Floridians who are sitting pretty.
Because if there’s one thing we love more than cashing Social Security checks, it’s counting ballots. Just ask Al Gore.

You check your phone. The shuttle is late again. It’s always late—by exactly eight minutes every time. You wonder why that is, but your thoughts are soon interrupted by the rattling of a geriatric bus, painted crimson, which comes squealing to a stop in front of Widener gate.
The driver beckons you on. Under the shadow of his hat, his head is either bald or a naked skull. You scan the length of the bus. The other passengers look dreary. Among them: an old lady mumbles to herself while clutching a beaded purse full of cats; no less than four pairs of twins giggle to each other in the aisles; and a couple of thugs pound their fists in the back.
You decide to take the seat right behind the driver. “Does this shuttle go to the Quad?” you ask. He doesn’t answer, but moves his head in a way that might indicate yes. All of a sudden it gets dark and begins to pour down rain. “Pretty rainy, huh,” you remark to the driver in an attempt to make small talk. He doesn’t answer.
Soon you’re rattling down Garden Street in what seems to be a Quad-ward direction. It’s too dark to tell for sure. The peaked ceilings of the SOCH come into view. As usual, it's completely empty.
"You know the ten-man suite?" says the driver suddenly, "Used to be the eleven-man. Well, here we are." The bus doors fly open, and you're propelled out by a magnetic force.
The other passengers follow. The thugs don penguin suits and head toward Pfoho; from the sounds of it, the dining hall is hosting a rager featuring a musical saw ensemble. All four pairs of twins make beelines for Cabot Cafe to commensurate over double soy lattes. The old lady picks up her purse full of cats and stumbles into Currier, mistaking it for a nursing home.
You step onto the sidewalk, only to immediately realize, lo and behold, you never wanted to come to the Quad in the first place, and that there was no reason for you to get on that shuttle.
"Wait!" you say as you turn around. But the bus has disappeared. Kaput. Gone. Not a trace. "Not again," you sigh, as you hitch up your pack for the long trek back to Harvard Yard. The walk will take you precisely 17 minutes. But you're not worried. You have all the time in the world—in fact, you have all of eternity.

We all know the similarities between love and drunkenness: they’re confusing; they make us write a lot of shitty poetry; they bring us closer to God; they result in public vomiting. I am also frequently—like three or four times weekly—deep in one or both of them. Resultantly, I have as many feelings as there are sparkly gay stars in the galaxy. In order to siphon some of these feelings onto you people, today in Four Dollar Wine, things are going to get a little lovey/sexy. As the poets know, forget the heart—love lies in the liver.
Charles Shaw Merlot
($2.99/bottle; Trader Joe’s)
“Charlie,” I breathe, “I’ve been waiting for you.” It’s Sunday night, late. I shouldn’t be succumbing to this temptation—I still have to read 150 pages of subaltern studies—but I can’t hold on any longer: I crave your sweet release. My breath is coming fast, which is probably because I don’t work out and live on the third story, and I’m aching for your tall, hard form, opaque, but with a hot red interior. You’re looked down upon—my friends all make fun of me—but I don’t care that you’re just a three dollar brew from the local bourgeois grocery: I want you. I slink into our suite, and don’t bother to barricade myself in the bathroom before uncorking you in front of everybody—just how we discussed when we planned out this scene earlier, deciding on a safeword and discussing our expectations, turn-ons, and fears. I have you straight, nothing between my mouth and the cool glass (a choice we feel comfortable with, having assessed the risks and honestly discussed our sexual histories), hard and a little slippery. I am open to you, you are flowing into me, your red liquids acrid and lovely. “Oh, Charlie,” I moan. “I could stay like this forever. Me, you, and this copy of ‘Dominance Without Hegemony.’”

In Urdu, there are said to be Seven Stages Of Love: dilkashi (attraction), uns (attachment), mohabbat (love), akidat (trust), ibadat (worship), junoon (obsession), and maut (death). This provides a helpful framework for thinking about my current relationships: Velvet Moon Cabernet Sauvignon, my vibrator, and my roommates. Attraction: A friend offers me a free bottle of Velvet Moon Cabernet Sauvignon. I am attracted. Attachment: I take from her the bottle of Velvet Moon Cabernet Sauvignon. Because it is in my hand, I am attached to it. Love: Velvet Moon Cabernet Sauvignon’s name is an ointment poured forth; therefore do the virgins love thee. I, on the other hand, think love is a tool of biopolitical social control, and virginity a construct. Trust: Velvet Moon Cabernet Sauvignon tastes like an alcoholic beverage. I trust it to intoxicate me. Worship: I don’t worship Velvet Moon Cabernet Sauvignon because I have a healthy sense of balance and also am more interested in that chick in my gov class, but it does have notes of cherry. Obsession: I can literally think of nothing besides Velvet Moon Cabernet Sauvignon. Death: Death is scary. I will drink more Velvet Moon Cabernet Sauvignon, which has some boysenberry notes and is slightly spicy, to avoid contemplating the inextricability of passion and mortality.

Maya Angelou once said, “you can tell a lot about a person by the way s(he) handles these three things: a rainy day, lost luggage, and tangled Christmas tree lights.” Frankly, FM thinks a playlist gives you more information. So turn on Spotify, and transport yourself across the coast as you read this week’s scrutiny.
Springsteen —Eric ChurchMaybe it’s because the students can identify with lyrics like “flip flops and cutoff jeans” 365 days a year or because “it is spring or is it summer?” is a serious epistemological question when you lack seasons—but country is more popular with cardinals than you’d think. They don’t call it “the farm” for nothing.
Go Your Own Way—Fleetwood MacA confirmed classic for at least one of Stanford’s famed Co-ops (that’s right, there’s more than one)—hardly surprising given the lyrics advocating independent and unconventional exploration. On the West Coast, you do you.  I Need My Girl—The NationalIt’s hard to even imagine a Cambridge-appropriated ambiance for this song. After all, the “competition to see who can feel less” doesn’t work so well with admitting you need someone. Maybe Stanford hookup culture knows something we don’t.
How You Love Me—3lauTurns out EDM never died in the Bay Area; it just got upgraded from underground warehouse to college dorm. Along with 3lau, Flume and Calvin Harris (non-festival) are cornerstones of pregame playlists.
All About That BassIt’s reassuring to know that truly great art transcends geographic and cultural differences; apparently this universally popular track “was played hella the first few weeks of school.”

Last week, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences announced that is likely to create a new undergraduate concentration in Theater, Dance, and Media. We weren’t sure exactly how “media” fit into all of this. But we thought it was a good idea. So good, in fact, that we thought that some other concentrations that could also benefit from a little dose of media.
Astrophysics and MediaEvery year, a new movie brings us astrophysicist-heroes who rocket off to save the Earth from one extra-terrestrial threat or another. Course materials include Deep Impact and “Armageddon and a field trip to see Interstellar in 3D.
Comparative Study of Religion and MediaThis concentration will answer some important questions, such as: What does the Pope like to watch? What is “The 700 Club,” and why is it always on ABC Family at seven a.m.?
Germanic Languages and Literatures and MediaOne really cannot be considered a student of Germanic language without a little knowledge of Swedish television or Utvarp Saga, Iceland’s leading radio station.
Folklore and Mythology and MediaStudents will watch “The Lord of the Rings” instead of reading it.
History and Science and MediaThis concentration is really three fields all rolled into one. It’s ideal for students who can’t decide if they’re history people, science people, or nightly news-people. Curious about the history behind the technology behind the screen of your TV? No, us neither.
Visual and Environmental Studies and MediaWait. No, that makes too much sense.

We all have that one TF… No, not the TF you’re secretly lusting over. The one that will never explicitly call you out for skipping readings, but continues to stare you down in section. It’s the same one who’s been writing snarky comments in menacing red ink (or passive-aggressive purple) on every response paper. In honor of mean marginalia, FM collected some of the worst—or best, depending on how you look at it—TF comments that have been penned this semester.
TF: “This compare/contrast doesn’t necessarily suggest that you’ve read the text. Check− ” Classic—getting the worst grade of the semester on the first book you’ve cracked open.

“Take your journey. Change your body. Find your soul.”
Displayed in bright, fluorescent tubes, these words greet me, as they’ve greeted every other person—most of them dressed in spandex—who’s ever walked through the doors of this sanctuary. Except we’re not in a sanctuary. We’re at SoulCycle.
How did I end up at the world’s trendiest 45-minute spinning class? I first heard about SoulCycle this summer from raving friends who claimed it was more than just an exercise session. Then an article in The Atlantic called the group workout an “example of how a limited set of Americans might find new expressions of spirituality.” It appeared that for its many adherents, SoulCycle was not just a workout for the body; it was a workout for the soul.
Though many friends suggested I give SoulCycle a shot, I initially swore I’d never go. I was morally against paying $30 for a workout, I explained. Vibrant shades of yellow and an outspoken following weren’t enough to lure me to the cult. Then I heard Gisele Bundchen frequently attended classes at the nearest SoulCycle. Going once couldn’t hurt.
So on a breezy Saturday morning, I found myself with my friend Christine—a self-proclaimed SoulCycle aficionado—at the Chestnut Hill SoulCycle. With a bottle of water in my hand ($2) and special rental shoes on my feet (free for the first class, but usually $3), I was ready to discover my inner soul.
When it was finally time to enter the studio, I got a glimpse of what the next 45 minutes would entail. There were 5 rules of etiquette printed on the wall. These ranged from the obvious (“No cell phones”) to the metaphysical (“We ride close together so we can feel each other’s energy” or “talking during class is a major distraction for the spiritual folks around you”).  There were 55 bikes—nearly all of them taken—and only 11 males, myself included.
“Welcome to SoulCycle everyone,” a voice boomed over the speakers. At the very front, an athletic woman in her mid-twenties took the bike at the center of the room. “We’ve got three short minutes before we start, so it’s great to see everyone getting settled into their bikes.” I looked around to see everyone on their bikes, besides me. Apparently, the instructor—who I’ll call Kristen—noticed the same thing. “If you’re new, don’t worry,” she said through the speakers, making eye contact with me. “I can help you myself.”
Before I knew it, Kristen had made her way to me in the back row. “Hey there!” she greeted me, her microphone turned off. “Welcome to SoulCycle!”
“Thanks,” I responded. “I feel like I’m getting the VIP treatment.”
She proceeded to introduce herself and helped me figure out the dimensions of my bicycle. Though we were getting dangerously close to the start time, she was determined to make sure I knew what to expect; the comfort of new riders was her top priority, she explained.
When it was finally time to begin the class, all the lights in the room turned off, and a playlist comprised of bass-heavy house music filled the speakers. Strobe lights punctuated each beat. “Greetings everyone,” Kristen said over the music. “I’m happy to be here. I’m originally from Boston, but I’m coming with experience from SoulCycle New York.”
“That means she must be really legit,” Christine whispered.
“That makes no sense,” I responded.
By the second song, my headband and shirt were already drenched in sweat. Worse, as I reached to wipe my sweat, I accidentally knocked my sweat towel onto the ground. Suddenly, there was nothing I could use to hide my true state of physical being from the rest of the class; I felt naked.
“Crouch above your seats like you’re in child’s pose,” Kristen instructed. “And turn right!” she shouted, as she jammed her head forward right as the song hit a downbeat. “And left!” she yelled, a second after. “Right again!” Bang. “Left!” Bang. “Dance to the music!”
So, on top of riding a bike next to strangers in the dark, I danced. As I looked around the room, I saw everyone in a near-synchronized form, violently jerking their heads to the beat of the music. “You couldn’t look more out of place,” Christine alerted me over the music.
Throughout the workout, Kristen shouted pieces of inspiration, most of them completely unrelated to fitness: “This is your sanctuary!” “Don’t ever listen to people who say you can’t do something!” “Tonight is Saturday night, so get ready for your drinks!” The crowd responded with cheers and grunts of approval.
Halfway through the workout, Kristen’s attentions turned to someone in the center of the room. “This is your party!” she yelled. A woman in the third row briefly looked up at Kristen and gave her a terse nod. “Kathy, today is your birthday, and you’re celebrating it at SoulCycle.” Kathy continued to stare ahead and pedal. “This is your party!” Kristen yelled again.
Though I struggled throughout the class, I understood how the experience could be cathartic. As trite as they were, Kristen’s pointers would routinely boost my spirits and encourage me to pedal faster. Moreover, everyone in the room appeared content to be sharing a space and their sweat with the other denizens of Chestnut Hill. Perhaps the etiquette on the wall was correct—maybe we do feed off each other’s energy.
Gradually, the music slowed, and the class began to wrap up. “You’ve earned this, everyone,” Kristen announced, without elaborating on what exactly we had earned. The conclusion couldn’t come sooner. Though many of my preconceptions about SoulCycle turned out to be accurate—the clientele, the cult-like atmosphere, the comedy of it all—there was one thing that caught me off guard: I was exhausted, both in body and soul.
“Oh, one last thing,” Kristen announced before we could leave. “There’s something important that we forgot to do.” And then we all sang happy birthday to Kathy.

One couple met through a mutual friend at the end of freshman year. Another met in Annenberg. A third met in the Quincy dining hall. So began the relationships of three couples at Harvard, all of which are interracial.
Though these three couples are alike in that they include students of different races, they paint vastly different portraits of interracial dating at Harvard. While the two Asian and white couples interviewed for this article say that they have not confronted any discrimination due to their mixed-race relationship, the white and black couple interviewed said they have encountered a substantial amount of prejudice on campus.
Like any discussion of race, the topic of interracial relationships can be incendiary and can produce heated opinions. This article does not and cannot canvass the experiences of all interracial couples who have dated at Harvard. Rather, it presents the views of three couples who agreed to discuss their stories and to add to the conversation. Several other couples that represent many other ethnicities were also invited to participate but declined to do so.
For Sophie T. Carroll ’17, a Kirkland resident who is white, and Stephen S. Yen ’17, a Pforzheimer resident who is Asian, being part of a romance that stretches from the river to the Quad can be more problematic than being part of an interracial couple. Throughout the three months that they have been dating, Carroll and Yen say that they have never felt singled out or looked down upon because of their relationship.
If anything, they note that their genders may draw more attention than their ethnicities do. “If you think about Asian, white couples, usually the female is Asian, and the male is white,” Yen says, explaining that Asian women are stereotypically considered more feminine than Asian men are thought to be masculine. “But I still don’t think people have been that surprised.”
Eva Shang ’17, who is Asian, and Christian G. D. Haigh ’17, who is white, similarly attest that the interracial element of their relationship has not been an issue. “I didn’t think it was a particularly big deal…. No one’s making comments,” says Haigh. Shang agrees. “I think the biggest deal is people thought it was cool that he was British, but that was it.”
According to Shang, one challenge that Asian women at Harvard do face is the perception that some men have an “Asian fetish.” “It’s really hard to tell if the guy that’s hitting on you is actually hitting on you because he likes you…or because he just has a thing for Asians,” she says. “There is a particular stereotype of Asian-American women as hypersexual and submissive, or whatever, and those things can definitely manifest.”
Implications of an “Asian fetish” aside, Shang remarks that her relationship with Haigh has not raised eyebrows because Asian and white relationships are so ordinary at Harvard. “I don’t know that most people would consider white and Asian interracial because it happens so frequently,” says Shang. “I think it’s more common at Harvard. I think it’s definitely more accepted.” But, she adds, “I think the case would be very different if he was black, or I was black or Hispanic.”
Indeed, Julie L. Coates ’15, a white student, and Dami A. Aladesanmi ’15, a black student, say that they have faced significant challenges both at Harvard and outside of Cambridge since they began dating. (Coates published an op-ed in The Crimson about her experience being in an interracial relationship after this interview was conducted.) Before Coates and Aladesanmi launch into their negative experiences, however, they are quick to point out that they have many friends on campus who support them and their relationship.
The couple says they sense that most of the disapproval of their relationship has come from Harvard’s black community. “Dami has had some situations where he felt flak from both black women and black men, because it’s the whole concept of, African Americans have this obligation to rebuild the African American family, and how’s that going to happen if they’re not marrying each other?” says Coates. They have also noticed that students in the black community who do support them are uncomfortable expressing their approval of interracial dating around other black students. In public conversations about mixed relationships, “people get really tense and awkward and quiet, but then afterward in privacy, they’ll be like, ‘Hey Dami, I actually really agree with what you were saying,’” Coates explains.
A few particularly upsetting moments have stuck with them. When Aladesanmi told his friend that he “was worried that some of the other people who I was friends with might take [his relationship with Coates] the wrong way because of how there’s sort of a stereotype about successful black men ‘upgrading’ to white women,” the friend responded that while many friends would be supportive, “some people won’t like it.”
“This was my first experience with a group of black students or black people where I felt like my relationship wasn’t fully approved of, so that really caught me off guard,” Aladesanmi says.
On another occasion, Aladesanmi, whose parents are Nigerian immigrants went with Coates to what they thought would be a playful meeting run by the Harvard College Nigerian Students Association about dating a Nigerian. But when a student—one of Coates’s close friends, with whom she had previously lived—was asked whether she regarded interracial dating as a threat to Nigerian culture, the meeting reportedly took a turn for the worse. “I remember feeling so little and very embarrassed and awkward and out of place when she avoided eye contact with me, looked at her feet, and mumbled about how yeah, it was a threat,” Coates recalls.
Coates suggests that disapproval of their relationship takes on an academic tone within Harvard’s black community. “Black opposition at Harvard will have a thesis, an Af-Am philosophy attached to it,” says Coates. “When someone’s talking to Dami about why he shouldn’t date me, they’ll randomly quote black nationalism text.” They also cite the success of “I, Too, Am Harvard,” a project which they both respect, as a factor that they believe has caused students to more openly criticize their relationship. “I think it’s almost been like the campus has been under a pressure cooker lately, with all the racial initiatives that have been going on for the past year,” Coates says. “Since movements like that have taken place, racial discourse has been addressed so much more on campus than it has been in past years, and it’s almost like it’s given people more comfort and more confidence in vocally opposing our relationship.”
While Coates and Aladesanmi have perceived resentment from their black classmates, they say they have noticed, at times, a more subtle lack of acceptance from their white peers. “Whereas on the black side I feel tension and hostility, like irritation with me for ‘stealing’ someone, on the white side, I usually don’t get anger. In the Harvard context, I usually get micro-aggressions that are actually coming from a good place, that are meant to be silly and harmless, but they’re actually kind of hurtful,” says Coates.
Coates, who previously dated two South Asian students at Harvard, notes that she did not experience comparable discrimination in her other interracial relationships, and that she had felt accepted by Harvard’s South Asian community. She has noticed that her friends who are in Hispanic and white relationships or white and Asian relationships have not suffered the intolerance that she and Aladesanmi have endured while dating. Echoing Shang and Haigh’s sentiment, Coates and Aladesanmi believe that their specific gender combination as a white woman and a black man, a historically contentious pairing, makes a difference in the reception of their relationship on campus.
In sum, Coates and Aladesanmi say, they feel tolerated at Harvard—but not accepted. “Acceptance has a positive connotation, almost the image of someone welcoming you with open arms, whereas tolerance is, ‘Okay, I won’t stop you,’” Coates explains. “In my experience in the realm of Harvard’s campus, I feel like everyone is tolerant, but that does not mean everyone is accepting.”

Last week, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences announced that the College likely offer a concentration in Theater, Design, and Media next fall. Though the addition of a new concentration is exciting, it’s not the first time it has happened—Harvard was not created with all 48 concentrations, but rather added them throughout the years. With the declaration date for sophomores looming on the metaphorical horizon (lookin’ at you, prospective English concentrators), FM has thoughtfully compiled a chronology of the addition of concentrations through the ages.
1906: History and Literature.
The first concentration ever, created by Professor Barrett Wendell, and fueled by a couple of drinks in a tavern (the same could probably be said for students who chose to participate in it).
1920s: English, Romance Languages, Fine Arts, Biology, Mathematics, Chemistry, Classics, Government, Literature, Psychology, Social Ethics, Astronomy, Economics, Geology, German Languages, Music, Philosophy, and Physics.
 For the people who saw Hist. and Lit. thesis writers, and wanted to run in the other direction. Any direction. 
1931: Sociology.  
Simple cause and effect: Freud publishes “Civilization and its Discontents” in 1929, Harvard creates a concentration to fix the world.
1933: Slavic Language and Literature.
Because nothing says “Great Depression” better than Russian literature!
1960: Social Studies.
You have to cater to the indecisive crowd at some point…
1967: Folklore and Mythology.
Coincidentally the last time the Loch Ness Monster was sighted. Legend has it he’s dorming beneath the Eliot Bridge, still trying to think of a thesis topic to this day (personal memoir doesn’t count). 
1968: Visual and Environmental Studies.
There’s no accident that its creation coincided with the release of classic films like “Romeo and Juliet,” “Rosemary’s Baby,” and “Planet of the Apes.” What’s the fun in boasting alumni with Nobel Prizes when you can have an Oscar instead?
1970: Special Concentration.
If Folklore and Mythology wasn’t out there enough for you. Nessie’s considering switching. 
1974: Comparative Religion.
Also the year of “People” magazine. The relevance of both are still being contested. 
1981: Computer Science.
Given the size of the machines back then, office hours must have been crowded. 
1988: Women’s Studies.
Trickled down in response to Reagan, but not in the way he expected. 
1992: Environmental Science and Public Policy.
Just in case Reagan was not sufficiently pissed.
2006: Chemical and Physical Biology, Human Evolutionary Biology, Molecular and Cellular Biology, and Organismic and Evolutionary Biology.
Sex ed suddenly makes a lot more sense. 
2012: Mechanical Engineering.
Because Harvard is known for being at the forefront of structural innovation.

With midterm elections almost upon us, pollsters are predicting a tough fight for the Capitol—and as always, Harvard is well-represented at the polls. Two years ago, the election of the 113th Congress saw the number of Harvard graduates in Congress grow from 34 to 43. Many of these alums and their fellows in state government will now be defending their spots from a fresh group of challengers, several of whom also attended the University. Below, you’ll find some of the notable Harvard alumni involved in this year’s midterms.
Massachusetts: Republican Charles D. Baker ’79 is challenging Democrat Martha M. Coakley for the state governorship. Baker, an English concentrator who played junior varsity basketball his freshman year, had difficulty fitting in during his time at Harvard and has stated that it was “four years [that he] would rather forget.”
Alaska: Dan Sullivan ’87, who graduated magna cum laude, has secured the Republican primary and now faces incumbent Democrat Mark Begich in the Senate general election. Sullivan, a Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Marine Corps Reserve, joined the Armed Forces in 1993 and has been awarded the Defense Meritorious Service Medal.
Arizona: The son of Hispanic immigrants, Ruben Gallego ’04 was a first-generation college student when he attended Harvard in the early 2000s. Now, he’s a Marine Corps veteran and the current Democratic nominee to represent Arizona’s 7th Congressional District.
Connecticut: Jim Himes ’88 was the Harvard Men’s Lightweight Crew captain before graduating in 1988. Elected to represent Connecticut’s 4th Congressional District in 2009, he is now defending his spot against Republican challenger Dan Debicella, who he defeated in the 2010 midterm.
Minnesota: Former comedian Al Franken ’73 surprised voters when he announced his entry into politics with his candidacy for Senate in 2008. Franken, who graduated cum laude from Harvard, has worked as a stand-up comic and writer for Saturday Night Live and delivered the Class Day address in 2002. He is now an incumbent Democrat facing Republican Mike McFadden, former CEO of Lazard Middle Market, a Minnesota bank .
Virginia: The Libertarian Party has selected Robert Sarvis ’98 as its candidate for Senate. Sarvis, who is also a software developer, was named by Google as a Grand Prize Winner for their Android Development Challenge before moving into politics. His opponents include Democrat Mark R. Warner, a Harvard Law School graduate and former governor of Virginia, and Republican Ed Gillespie.
California: Mark A. Takano ’83 made history as the first non-white, openly gay member of Congress. Now he’s defending his House seat against Republican Steve Adams in the race for California’s 9 District.

In 1692, there was a tide in the affairs of the Mathers. Increase Mather, the family patriarch, had just reluctantly accepted his appointment as Harvard’s seventh president. His son, Cotton, was a bright-eyed and bushy-tailed young minister who fully immersed himself in all things Protestant. Neither had much to do with the other’s business, until something wicked came their way.
Cotton Mather, in all his piousness, developed a fascination—or, more appropriately, an obsession—with the nearby Salem witch crisis. He used his family’s political clout to ensure that William Stoughton, a staunch man of God, was appointed chief justice, a position that involved presiding over a special witchcraft tribunal. Cotton then acted as puppeteer and almost single-handedly heated the crucible that would explode into a small-scale massacre.
Fully capitalizing upon his familial power, Cotton Mather manipulated the Puritan justice system. He issued a formal opinion stating that the use of “spectral evidence” should be permitted in the trials as evidence of witchcraft by the defendant. Afflicted girls submitted spectral evidence by claiming that the accused appeared to them in ghost form and forced them to behave in certain parent-averse and socially deviant ways. Once a witness submitted spectral evidence against a defendant, she (most were women) could in no way redeem herself. It was a simple, attractive option for any troubled, attention-seeking teen: Crying witch got them off the hook, but it also condemned their scapegoats.
In response to Cotton’s shenanigans, papa Increase implemented what could be interpreted as the first “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy. The president of Harvard didn’t want to intervene in that sticky Salem situation. If anything, he supported the jury that would eventually hang 19 innocent people.
However, once a Mather daughter was accused of witchcraft, everything changed. Increase’s fire flamed fervently. He wrote countless sermons condemning his son’s very own case for spectral evidence, slowing and eventually stopping Salem’s hunt. In one sermon, Increase famously decreed what would later be known as Blackstone’s Formulation: “It were better that Ten Suspected Witches should escape, than that one Innocent Person should be Condemned."
It is unclear how deep the Mathers’ convictions actually ran. Although the trials nearly claimed his sister as a victim, Cotton never expressed any guilt over the witch hunt. In fact, according to historian George Bancroft, Cotton publicly considered witches "among the poor, and vile, and ragged beggars upon Earth.” It’s safe to assume that he held on to his grudge. Increase, although officially opposed to the trials, was motivated by fatherly instincts, not moral outrage. When Robert Calef wrote a critique of Cotton condemning his involvement with Salem in an attempt to weaken the Mather powerhouse, Increase abandoned his responsibilities as a man, a scholar, and, perhaps most appallingly, Harvard’s leader. He orchestrated a burning of Calef’s defamatory “More Wonders of the Invisible World,” and the smoke of scorched books shrouded Harvard Yard.

Try talking over the sound of 10 stacks of cards being expertly shuffled around a cozy Sever conference room: This is the frequent struggle of the Harvard Magic Society during their weekly meetings. The small club is composed of about 10 members who fit comfortably at a round table, where they discuss, learn, and perform the ancient art of magic.
Assuming the role of what former president Yi-Jun Tan ’13 would call “a layperson,” I attend one of these meetings to learn more about the club and its members. Although he graduated in 2013, Tan appears at every gathering; sitting to my left, he shows off his dexterity by cutting a deck once, twice, and a third time with one hand.
Other members who still attend the college spend a considerable amount of time in society meetings and on their own to perfect their art, especially the art of card tricks. Harry T. Newman-Plotnick ’18 and Larson C. Ishii ’15, both in their first year with the society, like to make sure that magic is a part of their life on a regular basis. Ishii contemplated declaring a special concentration in magic, combining VES and Mind, Brain, and Behavior to look at the nature of illusions.
Unsurprisingly, the group’s meeting location and pathway to membership are just as elusive as the magic that they perform. Many Harvard students are unaware the club exists, let alone where to find it or what the magicians do. “The comp for the society is finding the club first,” Ishii jokes. “I’ve been looking for the Magic Society for two years and could only join now. They did a very bad job of publicizing themselves for a very long time.”
In the past previous presidents believed in the benefit of remaining intimate and compact. “For a while the old president wanted to keep it very exclusive,” Newman-Plotnick states, as he wanted people who appreciated the art at the base of magic, “not those who were simply interested in figuring out the secret behind the trick.”
But recent leadership has expressed an interest in reforming this exclusivity and expanding their size. Members intend to focus more on publicizing the group and organizing more demonstrations, with the goal of facilitating a general curiosity in the performance of magic on campus.
While multiple members seem to be well versed in the language of magic, the club includes participants of all levels. Coinciding with a new attention to advertising, the current president is also open to more novice magicians and spends many of the meetings teaching the basics to the neophytes. “It’s a very big commitment to try and teach someone magic,” Newman-Plotnick explains, but the new leadership is very accommodating.
This gap in skill level does make cohesiveness in the club very difficult because novel magicians require a good deal of attention. The weekly meetings are often divided between newcomers learning basic proficiencies and advanced illusionists sharpening their intricate tricks. “The first meeting was literally just learning how to shuffle cards and the correct way to hold a deck,” Ishii explains. “These things seem very basic, but if you’re not an active card player you wouldn’t know the correct way.”
While some would expect the Magic Society to organize shows and spectacles featuring illusions worthy of David Copperfield, the shortage of advanced participating magicians and the disparity in skill level in the group makes shows very difficult. “It takes a while to become performance ready,” Ishii states. “Half of our club probably couldn’t perform right now.” The current members hope to find a way to perform in coming years, and plan to publicize this future demonstration it in a big way.
Everyone joins the society for a different reason. “It makes really smart obnoxious people feel stupid,” Newman-Plotnick says to justify his interest in magic. No matter what individual reason for interest in magic and despite slight difficulties that accompany a diverse skill level, the Magic Society encourages anyone attracted to learning the art to join. These magicians are happy to reveal their tricks, if you can find them.

“It was me and three other girls, and I was like: ‘Wow, I did not expect this to happen,’” says David Y. Jeong ’17, a game director of the Harvard eSports Association. He is talking, of course, about a four-player “Super Smash Bros.” game he played on a Nintendo Wii at his club’s first LAN (local area network) party of the year.

"He was a Rare Scholar himself, and he made many more such; but their Education truly was In the School of Tyrannus."
-Cotton Mather, Class of 1678
If you haven’t heard of Nathaniel Eaton, Harvard’s first head of school, it’s not because he’s one of the University’s buried treasures. Described by one student as “fitter to have been an officer in the inquisition, or master of an house of correction, than an instructer (sic) of Christian Youth,” Eaton’s disastrous year-and-a-half-long tenure, from 1638 to 1639, ended in a court case in which he was ordered to step down and pay a fine. The school closed down for the subsequent academic year. The affair was such a scandal that in 1940, some students argued that 1640 should be seen as the real founding year of Harvard College. Here are just a few things that made Nathaniel Eaton and his regime, well, shitty.
BRUTAL BEATINGS
Eaton hired one Nathaniel Briscoe to be an usher (essentially an assistant). Briscoe had been working for Eaton for less than a week when there was some disagreement between the two men and Eaton beat him with a switch. According to John Winthrop’s journal, the switch was “a walnut tree plant, big enough to have killed a horse, and a yard in length.” Briscoe received 200 stripes and the beatings continued for two hours, Winthrop wrote, though Eaton gave him two or three short intermissions.
After the beatings had concluded, Briscoe started praying, thanking God that he hadn’t died. Eaton promptly began beating him for using the Lord’s name in vain.
The incident ended up being taken to court, where it emerged that Eaton routinely would give his students between 20 and 30 stripes at a time, not stopping until they had confessed to the crime of which they were accused.
DUNG IN THE HASTY PUDDING AND OTHER DINING DEPRIVATIONS
Nathaniel wasn’t the only Eaton compromising the health of Harvard students. In her confession during the trial, Eaton’s wife admitted to neglecting the goat dung her servants had slipped into the hasty pudding, a porridge she prepared for students’ meals (it seems that the Hasty Pudding here has always been shitty.)
Eaton’s wife also drew some flak for confessing to feeding the students spoiled fish and sour bread, a far cry from our modern-day luxuries of succulent swai and endless sleeves of multi-grain bagels. Eaton’s wife was in charge of drink as well as food. During the trial, she revealed that the students were often short on beer for as long as a week at a time. Though HUDS has been short on beer for far longer than a week, the beverage was considered a necessary component of education in the 17th century, on par with books.
EMBEZZLEMENT AND FLIGHT
After being found guilty of beating Briscoe and other misdemeanours, Eaton fled to New Hampshire with a good chunk of College funds in his pocket. Three men from Massachusetts captured him but, in a move that can only be described as Jack Sparrow-esque, Eaton engineered a ruse by which two of his captors were left on the shore while he threw the third into a river from a rowboat. Once he’d given his captors the slip, Eaton moved to Virginia, carrying debts of over 1,000 pounds. He remarried (his first wife had died by this time), and settled there until he heard that his creditors from the north were on his trail. Abandoning his second wife, he booked it to England and remarried yet again.
He quickly fell into debt and was arrested two times. The first time, he was able to bribe the man arresting him, but after the second booking, he was thrown into debtor’s prison, where he died in 1764.
SUCCESSION
Harvard was closed during the academic year 1639-1640, after which Henry Dunster resumed operations and became the first man to hold the title “President of Harvard College.” Dunster found a number of Eaton’s former students still hanging around the College, though they were “miserably distracted,” and promptly put them on a rigorous course of study to set the course for their graduations in 1642.
While Dunster improved the quality and reliability of dining services, he, too, was rumored to have had a penchant for beating his students. His presidency lasted 14 years. Though Eaton was long gone, it seems that some of his practices were not as quick to go.

THE GHOST OF JOHN HARVARD STATUE
By Yehong Zhu
It’s not easy being a 400 year-old plaything to 6,700 undergraduates. Unable to escape the brutal nightly hazings by intoxicated freshman, tormented by the inferiority complex that comes from being used quite literally as a “john,” and gloomy from serving as the running inside joke around campus, the ghost of the John Harvard statue has lost a lot of spirit. To compensate for his nightly humiliations, the John Harvard statue ghost looks for sources of validation. He attracts countless legions of tourists to mindlessly photograph his statuesque physique. He lures the uninitiated into caressing his golden toe. And yet, in the end, all his ghoulish efforts somehow still leave him feeling hollow inside.
THE GHOST OF THE SLEEP-DEPRIVED FRESHMAN
By Emma K.Talkoff
Long ago an overeager freshman stalked Harvard’s hallowed halls, driven by forces unseen to try his hand at every extracurricular the College offered. Improv comedy, acapella, IOP—he blindly committed to them all, double, triple, quapdruple-booking each week. Every night offered a new comp meeting, another forum, a fresh opportunity for free pizza. Before long, sleep was all but a distant memory, and our once bright-eyed hero saw his fall extend into one endless, sleepless day.Finally, one morning just before 9 a.m., gummy-eyed and exhausted, he collapsed somewhere between Canaday and Thayer, a sleep-slackened shell of his former self. “What happened to that one kid,” they lamented, “that one kid who was in, like, all the same clubs as me?” He was never seen again, but his ghost remained, tethered to the grounds which had robbed him of sleep and sapped him of life. Embittered and lonely, he vowed to inflict the same sleepless terror on generations of freshmen, for all eternity. “Let them try,” he moaned in an inhuman show of passive aggressiveness. “They will never sleep in again.”On weekends and late mornings, you can still hear his spirit prowling the Yard, pealing out its gloomy call for all to hear from the spire of Memorial Hall. The next time you wake with a start and a frustrated groan from your interrupted Saturday slumber, remember. Remember your fallen comrade, who succumbed to eternal sleep that fateful 8:40 am.
THE GHOST OF THE DISGRUNTLED DORM CREW EMPLOYEE
By Michelle Y. Raji
If you find yourself deprived of toilet paper on a snowy Thursday evening, beware: you might be the victim of a particularly passive aggressive spectre—the ghost of the disgruntled Dorm Crew employee.The ghost of the disgruntled Dorm Crew employee roams the basement of Weld Hall. This troubled soul’s fate was sealed after a petty dispute with a desperate college student over the irritating limit of two toilet paper rolls per student. Upon returning multiple times, only to be denied more toilet paper, the frustrated student impaled the unsuspecting student-employee with a nearby broomstick. Ever since, his restless spirit has haunted the Weld basement, occasionally visiting dorm room bathrooms to steal toilet paper in the wee hours of the morning, pitting roommates against each other. Many believe his acts of worldly vengeance are doomed efforts to fill the perpetual hole in his broom-stuck heart. It’s actually about “how drug testing and other privacy violations are alienating America’s youth,” he says.
THE GHOST OF VIRGINITIES PAST

If you find that the Widener stacks is one of your favorite haunts, watch out: as you sit in your isolated study carrel and attempt to skim the 400 pages you should have read weeks ago, you are not alone. And no, I’m not referring to the couple potentially getting it on a couple stacks over. I’m talking about the Ghost of Virginities Past.  Between rows of books levitates this far-too-hormonal fiend, resplendent in all its weepy, desperate, why-didn’t-you-call-me-back glory. In a reading-induced delusion exacerbated by a serious case of Harvard goggles, you might think the mysterious figure in front of you looks a lot like your ex, or maybe reminds you of that cutie in your entryway. I suggest that you run. The Ghost of Virginities Past is thirsty, and it’s not about to let you go. Especially if you’re a freshman.

There’s a cat in one corner, Steve Jobs in another, a pair of life-size salt and pepper shakers across from you. Obscene amounts of candy amass on top of tables and your roommates have decorated the common room with orange and black streamers. This means it’s Halloween and Halloween calls for some spooky alcoholic drinks. Here are some of FM’s favorites:
THE JACK-O-LANTERN1.5 oz. orange juice0.5 oz. ginger aleOrange wheel, for garnishAdd the brandy, orange juice, and ginger ale into a cocktail shaker with ice. Pour the concoction into a martini glass, and garnish with an orange wheel. Depending on preference, this garnish can easily be replaced with a human eyeball for some surprising texture. The concoction is sweet and bubbly and can be used to soothe the wickedness boiling inside you.
IT WAS A DARK AND STORMY NIGHT2 oz. dark rum3 oz. ginger beer3 oz. Guinness Stout0.5 oz. lime juiceCombine the rum, ginger beer, Guinness, and lime juice in a glass (or cauldron) full of ice cubes. Stir, as an evil cackle escapes from your lips. The richness of the smooth rum mingles perfectly with spice of the ginger beer—good for witches who like pumpkin spice lattes, or just Guinness.
THE BLACK WIDOW1.5 oz. black vodka 0.5 oz. cranberry juice1 cherry, for garnishSugar crystals, for rimRim a small glass with the sugar crystals, and fill with ice cubes. Pour cranberry juice over the ice and then add the black vodka to float on top. Garnish with a cherry, and revel in how dark and bloody your creation looks; though, actually, the drink is just bloody good.

Goodwill - Davis Square
Mon - Sat 10 a.m. - 7 p.m.
Sunday 12 p.m. - 6 p.m.
230 Elm St., Somerville
The holy grail of low-cost clothing and the mecca of all thrift stores, Goodwill is a staple for the most price-conscious of shoppers. The Davis Square location spans two floors, with women’s clothing and shoes on the first floor, and menswear and home in the basement. The lighting may be harsh, and the Obama posters and abundance of pleated jean skirts may make you feel like it’s 2008, but it’s hard to argue with the amount of clothing you get for your dollar. The store regularly has extra markdowns, and encourages you to embrace your inner gambler and buy scratch cards that promise potential extra discounts. You may have to kiss some proverbial frogs before you find your perfect match, but there are plenty of gems to be found among the mom jeans and tie dye.
Arranged by color rather than by item, this store isn’t the easiest to navigate if you have a specific list of clothing you’re looking for. It’s great place to go if you’re just browsing, trying to put together a costume, or just really feel like wearing yellow. There’s currently a section dedicated to Halloween which has a good selection of ready-made outfits, but you can just as easily create something fun from the rainbow array of racks. On a recent visit, one male shopper put together a Disney princess outfit (for himself) in three minutes flat. “Once I get the gold braid on it, you’ll never know it wasn’t official,” he said. We had to agree.
Buffalo Exchange
Mon- Sat 11 a.m. - 8 p.m.
Sun 12 p.m. - 6 p.m.
238 Elm St., Somerville
A couple of doors down from Goodwill lies the younger and more curated Buffalo Exchange. Also spread across two floors, the store offers women’s clothing, accessories, and shoes, and is mainly populated by self-aware hipster college students. There’s a strangely competitive atmosphere among the store’s clientele, like a pack of lions stalking a few BCBG gazelles. But if you’re looking to embrace your inner hunter, Buffalo Exchange will reward you with some decently priced designer merchandise and...uh...buffalos?
Prices are mid-range for a thrift shop—dresses cost between $15 - $20, sweaters between $10 and $30. Prices are pretty dependent on the brand. If you’re hoping to save extra money and have a load of clothes you never wear hanging around in your closet, you can trade in unwanted items for 35% of the value they will resell it for in cash, or 50% of that value in a gift card towards your next purchase in the store. The buyers, though, are notoriously picky about what they’ll take--you’ll have to resign to donating the pleated jean skirts to Goodwill. While you might be upset they don’t want a lot of your stuff, you’ll probably be thankful when you’re not wading through a slew of whatever was popular in 2010 when browsing the rails.
Oona’s Experienced Clothing
Mon. - Sun. 11 a.m. - 8 p.m.
1210 Mass. Ave.
Nestled in a quiet corner of Mass. Ave., it’s difficult to spot Oona’s inset, ivy-swathed door unless you’re actively looking for the store. However, if you do manage to stumble upon this gem, we promise you won’t be disappointed.
The warm, low-ceilinged interior is crowded with gilded mirrors and antique wooden furniture overflowing with silk scarves, wool hats, and elaborately embellished jewelry. From lambswool to cashmere to alpaca, their vast sweater selection is impressive, to say the least. With high quality fabric blends and reasonable prices, we couldn’t help but snag a few.
To our pleasant surprise, the men’s section was also quite sizable, overflowing with vintage Penfield and Woolrich jackets. And no, you’re not imagining it, there is a slight eau de marijuana lingering in the lining. Not to fear, a good dry cleaning will take care of that. In three words: sophisticated, quality, hipsterish.
Second Time Around
Mon. - Sat. 10 a.m. - 8 p.m.
Sun. 11 a.m. - 7 p.m.
8 Eliot St.
With Balenciaga, Tory Burch, and Badgley Mischka lining the shelves, if your desire is to go designer, look no further than this bright, boutique-like thrift located on the far end of the Square. This store has an incredible two-story selection of high-end fashion pieces that have been marked down anywhere from $100 to $800 off their original price. Granted, some of the items look pretty dated—as in straight from grandma’s closet dated—but honestly, it’s YSL, so who cares?
Second Time Around can get pretty pricey with some of its more rare finds in the upper hundreds, but if you’re willing to dig a little deeper in your pockets and cut out those late night Insomnia runs for the next month (or twenty), it can be worth it.

UPDATED: October 30, 2014, at 3:35 p.m.
STANFORD, Calif.—Stanford buzzes. Walk across any of the 8,000-plus acres of earthy-red tiles and dusty, rolling hills of the university’s grounds and you’ll find yourself dodging hundreds of bicycles, whose moving gears and wheels make the campus hum.
More than 13,000 bikes belonging to students and faculty traverse campus daily, according to the school’s website, and it’s no wonder why. Stanford University, a massive tract of land that occupies what was once Leland Stanford’s Palo Alto Stock Farm, is its own city, so large it requires an individual zip code.
In a way, the constant motion of Stanford’s bikers is indicative of the university’s dynamism. Even the university’s motto, “Die Luft der Freiheit weht”—or, “The Winds of Freedom Blow”—nods at Stanford’s focus on the cutting-edge of research and education in the 21st century.
“I really have never encountered a place as exciting or as forward-looking as Stanford,” says William Damon ’67, a professor at Stanford’s Graduate School of Education. “It’s in its time and in its place, sort of like Vienna at the turn of the 19th century.”
Three thousand miles northeast, administrators at America’s oldest university eye their California peer with intensifying scrutiny. Like Stanford, Harvard has a stated mission to embrace an ever-changing landscape of American higher education, one that questions the limits of humanities and is rapidly shifting focus to the quantitative and applied sciences.
With a delineated capital campaign initiative to raise $450 million for the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and other entrepreneurial initiatives and a charge to “uni[te] the wisdom of the past with the urgency of the present and the promise of the future,” Harvard is positioning itself to be the leader in education and research in the 21st century.
But to do so, it must reconcile its foundations as a liberal arts university with the shifting priorities of higher education in modern America.
Conversely, while in recent years Stanford has moved to bolster its humanities and arts programs, the university remains steadfast to its charge to produce students with “direct usefulness in life.”
Despite both schools’ attempts to strengthen what some call their historically weaker programs, their respective identities have largely been determined. And while both acknowledge the influence of the other, even admitting to adapting best practices, Harvard and Stanford remain staunchly defensive of their own educational missions, and by extension, these distinctive identities.
By the time Stanford opened its newly-minted doors, Harvard was 250 years old.
According to legend, two Californians, Leland and Jane Stanford, visited Harvard President Charles W. Eliot in the late 1800s to see about establishing a university in memory of their recently deceased son. Popular stories tell that Eliot refused their offer for money to rename Harvard, so the two, dressed in homespun, faded clothing, returned west to found their own university.
This account is erroneous. In fact, Eliot advised the Stanfords to create a university in memory of their son, but did not reject a request to rename Harvard or any Harvard building, according to a letter Eliot sent Stanford President David Starr Jordan in June of 1919.
The misleading, oft-told account of Stanford’s founding speaks to the perceived cultural divide between the two schools. Many students, faculty, and administrators at Stanford say they think of Harvard as an old university modeled after European institutions like Oxford and Cambridge, entrenched in tradition and emblematic of the ivory tower. By contrast, Stanford affiliates say that their university’s relative youth and “West Coast energy” invigorate the institution.
“There is an excitement about Stanford and a pulse about Stanford that at this point Harvard doesn’t have,” Damon says. “[It is] kind of like you are in an adventure when you are at Stanford, like you’re creating the future.”
Some trace Stanford’s progressive rise in international prominence to decisions made by Provost Frederick Terman, a mentor to William Hewlett and Dave Packard, who during his tenure in the 1950s and ’60s bolstered technology and electrical engineering programs at the university.
“Stanford was not really known for engineering until Terman came in and said ‘We are going to be the best engineering school in the world,’” says Matt Ohline, a Mechanical Engineering lecturer at Stanford. “He really launched Stanford as an engineering institute and started the Silicon Valley in the process.”
What followed was a steady, decades-long development of the southern region of the San Francisco Bay, thanks in large part to Terman’s initiatives and Stanford’s capital. When the dot-com bubble boomed in the ’90s, the young university flourished.
“Stanford is unique in the country in that it really has moved into the same niche as Harvard, whereas 50 years ago, I think Yale and Princeton would have been there,” says Harvard Graduate School of Education professor Howard E. Gardner ’65.
But some Stanford affiliates would argue that their university has surpassed Harvard.
“When I joined the faculty at Stanford in 1975, the feeling was, ‘it is a great place to be, but it sure ain’t Harvard,’” says David Spiegel, a professor at the Stanford School of Medicine who graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1971. “I don’t feel that way anymore. Nobody does.”
Nestled in golden foothills just south of the San Francisco Bay and inland of the Pacific Ocean, Stanford feels a world away from the red-brick, wind-bitten Cambridge, Mass. But what makes Stanford’s location unique is its intimate relationship with Silicon Valley, both a product of and a feeder for the school.
The relationship is at times visible, but is mostly intangible, manifested in the entrepreneurial mentality of many Stanford students and faculty. The school, which famously offered a course called “Startup,” taught by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, touts itself as the starting point of major companies like Google, Sun Microsystems, Hewlett Packard, and even Instagram.
“You’ll see a lot of companies coming in, doing workshops, scouting, having big career fairs,” says Simar S. Mangat, a sophomore computer science major at Stanford. “You co-create this entrepreneurship culture.”
That culture seems to have found its way into students’ wardrobes. Bright t-shirts with iconic tech logos, like those of Google, Dropbox, or Facebook, are a common sight on campus, as are Macbook laptops masked by collages of company stickers.
Years of media coverage focusing on Stanford’s relationship with the tech industry has eclipsed the school’s other fields of study, some administrators say.
“I think the problem is that the reputation of Silicon Valley can cast a very long shadow,” says Richard Saller, dean of Stanford’s School of Humanities and Sciences. “That can be a challenge.”
Stanford has sought to gain visibility for its humanities and arts programs, many of which saw increased support from Stanford’s recent $6.2 billion capital campaign, an amount Harvard is hoping to beat in its own ongoing campaign. Outsiders to Stanford may only see the technology and computer science side of the school, which in the current educational and economic climate makes it alluring.
“Let’s face it, if you’re in Silicon Valley, you are a sexy school,” says Harvard English professor Louis Menand. “That’s where exciting things are happening, not just intellectually, but also in terms of making money.”
Menand, a New Yorker staff writer who teaches a new framework humanities course at the College, says that while Stanford is a high-caliber institution on its own, no one can deny that part of Stanford’s strength comes from  “being associated with a part of the economy that has been incredibly attractive for the last ten years.”
“Stanford benefits from being right in the center of where all those things are happening,” Menand says. “Boston doesn’t have that exactly.”
Late one breezy Friday afternoon, hundreds of students file into the sleek, silver Hewlett Teaching Center at the heart of campus, which today houses one of Stanford’s most popular courses: Cs106A.
The course, Introduction to Computer Science: Programming Methodology, is offered every quarter. This fall, as many as 645 students fill a large auditorium three times a week to listen to one of the course’s professors, Mehran Sahami, deliver his lectures, which often involve candy prizes thrown into the depths of the lecture hall for students who participate and ask questions. Today, students have just completed one of their first programming projects—to create a brick breaker game—and now spend a portion of class reviewing how to animate a graphic.
Sahami’s course focuses on “the engineering of computer applications,” among other practical skills, which speaks to the university’s educational mission. Stanford’s objective to “qualify its students for personal success, and direct usefulness in life,” as stated in its founding grant, differs greatly than that of Harvard, which according to University literature, focuses primarily on the advancement of knowledge.
Stanford’s mission statement has only been perpetuated by the Silicon Valley and successful tech-industry graduates, constant reminders of the direct practicality and application of a Stanford education.
James T. Campbell, a History professor at Stanford, says that unlike at Harvard, Stanford’s culture emphasizes such practical application immediately, not just after students graduate.
“From its founding, the university has taken a rather instrumentalist approach to learning, and has been much less prone to thinking of itself as an ivory tower,” Campbell says.
Stanford German and Comparative Literature professor Russell A. Berman, who also chairs the university’s Faculty Senate, agreed that Stanford students are trained from the outset to apply their knowledge and skills.
“There’s a strong attention to the value of education in making practical improvements in society and the world,” he says.
Harvard focuses not so much on the application of education, but, as Harvard President Drew G. Faust wrote in an official capital campaign message, on the discovery of knowledge and the education of future leaders. The University remains true to its founding charter from 1650, part of which emphasizes the “advancement and education of youth in all manner of good literature, arts, and sciences.”
Mangat says he has encountered this dichotomy between Stanford and Harvard in his own experiences.
“We see Harvard as more focused on theory, the softer side,” he says. “Even in computer science, there’s a lot more focus on how you do things as opposed to Stanford, which focuses a lot more on the practicality.”
Stephanie H. Kenen, administrative director of Harvard’s Program in General Education, says that she believes universities should not focus on practicality.
“I have this romantic vision that a university is a really unique cultural institution whose purpose is to produce and conserve and disseminate knowledge,” she says. “It doesn’t build roads.”
Kenen paraphrases an inscription above Harvard’s Dexter Gate, which reads “Enter to grow in wisdom” on the outside, while the inside reads “Depart to serve better thy country and thy kind.”
“It’s right,” Kenen says. “Enter to grow in wisdom. When you leave you can go serve, but there is actually something that is supposed to happen while you are here, which is the gaining of wisdom.”
Bundled in a thick, dark coat and scarf, William C. Orman ’15-’16 clatters as he walks across the marble floors of Robinson Hall, finding temporary refuge from the strong gusts of wind that rattle through the trees of Harvard Yard. Orman attended Harvard in the 2011-2012 academic year before transferring to Stanford, only to return to Harvard the following year, for a mix of personal, athletic, and academic reasons.
He reflects on stereotypical images of Stanford and Harvard students, and the occupations most people might associate with both groups. For Stanford, he acknowledges the image of Silicon Valley and the tech industry. For Harvard, he talks about finance.
“[With] Stanford, you think of Teslas rolling down the hills,” Orman says. “When I was at Stanford, thinking about Harvard, I thought about cold weather, and people in peacoats, and [investment] banking, and going off to New York.”
He laughs, and then shrugs.
“Of course I realize that is unfair, and an oversimplification, but that’s the image.”
To some extent, these images ring true. According to The Crimson’s 2014 Senior Survey, 31 percent of the seniors who immediately entered the workforce pursued employment in the finance and consulting industries.
Conversely, students and professors say that at Stanford, graduates largely matriculate to jobs in the technology and engineering sector. But the presence of these industries are not just felt as seniors search for jobs—they are an integral part of the on-campus culture.
“You walk around campus and you hear names like Gates, Hewlett, and Packard,” says Alex Alifimoff, a senior studying management science and engineering at Stanford. “The fact that the names of the buildings are in honor of some of the most important people in the history of computing is pretty intimidating.”
This is also true at Harvard, but arguably at a lesser scale. Lloyd C. Blankfein ’75 of Goldman Sachs and Kenneth C. Griffin ’89 of Citadel LLC are just some of the Harvard-educated financiers whose names are nearly ubiquitous on campus; both have endowed scholarships and professorships.
To some, looking only toward a post-college future does a disservice to the university.
“Students nowadays, most of them don’t think they are going to go onto the academy, they want to do something of significance,” says Gardner. He adds, “If you’re just waiting out the clock until you get to Goldman Sachs, then the university isn’t showing what it is we are good at.”
But at Stanford, the culture of looking forward is amplified by the successes of current students, not just graduates.
“Every time a Stanford student reads that someone he met at a frat party just sold a startup for $1 million—and that happens a lot here—it dribbles a few more toxic drops into the water,” says Campbell. “It shapes students’ aspirations.”
Robert A. Lue, a professor of the practice of molecular and cellular biology at Harvard, says that atmosphere was palpable when he spoke with a group of students while attending a conference at Stanford earlier this year.
“I was just exhausted by the, ‘we’re going to form a startup, form a startup, form a startup, if we do this really well, we will capitalize it and sell it in two years, and sort of make a fortune,’” he says.
The different career paths that students pursue at each school are echoed in their popular areas of study. In 2013, Harvard’s largest concentration was economics, with 577 concentrators. Stanford’s largest major is computer science, which as of last Friday had 574 students.
That number, however, is dwarfed by the total number of students who study at Stanford’s School of Engineering, which, including computer science, amounts to 1,444 majors. About 33 percent of Stanford undergraduates are pursuing degrees at the engineering school, according to Janice Pang, a reporting and data analyst in Stanford’s engineering school.
By comparison, in 2013, 253 Harvard students concentrated in only computer science, while another 40 undergraduates chose to do a joint concentration in computer science and another field. Though the number of computer science concentrators has been steadily increasing since 2008, Harvard administrators acknowledge that there still is a large cultural divide between Harvard and Stanford.
“There is a huge number of students at Stanford now who concentrate in engineering, almost half,” says Faust. “That’s going to be a very different atmosphere from here.”
Yet Harry R. Lewis ’68, director of undergraduate studies for computer science at Harvard and former dean of the College, says that Harvard’s breadth and diversity of strengths adds to engineering and the applied sciences, rather than detracts from them.
“Harvard’s computer science program is embedded in the culture of arts and letters, and the social sciences, because we’re part of a university that is great in all of those areas, which Stanford is not,” says Lewis, noting that computer science is now the fifth largest concentration at the College. His own office, filled with books and polished rocks of various sorts and sizes, is a testament to that intermingling of disciplines.
“Would Facebook have started at Stanford? Maybe,” Lewis adds. “But Zuckerberg was taking half his courses in Psychology and Sociology, and I think it was the collision of the computer science and the social science experience that made him realize that there was a big opportunity there that no one else was doing.”
Since the early 2000s, Harvard has been scrambling to keep up in a higher education world increasingly shifting focus toward engineering and the applied sciences. In 2007, the Harvard Corporation and the Board of Overseers renamed SEAS from a division to a school, and today it represents $450 million of the FAS’s capital campaign. Even more, SEAS Dean Cheryl A. Murray announced last year that the school will increase its faculty by nearly 30 percent.
“Harvard made a decision in the last ten years to invest in what we call ‘STEM’ fields,” says Menand. “That was a pretty much necessary decision just from the point of view of Harvard’s competitiveness in the higher education world and in the U.S..”
Student interest in engineering and applied sciences has also increased with the expansion of the school. Since 2007, the number of concentrators has more than doubled, from 292 in 2007-2008 to 775 in 2013-2014. Additionally, in the wake of expansion, Harvard’s biosciences have topped charts worldwide, thanks in part to the accessibility of Boston hospitals. Such a robust area of science, in which Harvard boasts a strong program, would not succumb to boom and bust cycles typical of the technology industry, which may pose greater problems to Stanford in the future.
But some Stanford affiliates feel that Harvard is playing catch-up rather than truly innovating.
“I almost feel that they’re looking at Stanford and trying to do some of the stuff that Stanford was doing over the last five years,” says Elliot W. Hawkes ’09, who, after studying at Harvard, pursued a graduate degree in mechanical engineering at Stanford. “They’ve been putting a lot of money into it, hiring a ton of professors.”
In fact, according to former FAS Dean William C. Kirby, a History and Business School professor, when he visited Stanford’s campus during his administration, much of the inspiration for Harvard’s Northwest Labs came from Stanford’s “flexible” Clark Center, a massive complex of skylights, bridges, and floor-to-ceiling windows.
Paul Mitiguy, a professor from Stanford’s mechanical engineering department, says that this is a natural consequence of Harvard’s foundation as a liberal arts school. For his part, David Spiegel, the professor at Stanford’s medical school, says that one reason Stanford was able to surpass Harvard in terms of engineering was that it exploited the technology boom much earlier than Harvard did.
“Harvard was a little slow in taking advantage of, and growing with, the new digital technology,” says Spiegel. “Some of that may have had to do with the proximity to MIT,” he adds, positing that perhaps Harvard did not put much emphasis on developing its technologies when MIT was doing just that two T stops away.
While Harvard may be looking at Stanford as a model for the applied sciences, faculty and administrators from both schools say that Harvard’s Program in General Education and its approach to undergraduate teaching and learning has been foundational for Stanford as it reviews its own curriculum.
In May of 2007, Harvard faculty voted on a new set of general education requirements, which would replace the thirty-year old Core program. According to Kenen, the Core program was focused on “ways of knowing,” which introduced students to different methods of study and analysis unique to each discipline.
This new general education program, which is currently undergoing its first comprehensive review since it was introduced, does not focus on different methods of scholarly analysis. Instead, it includes eight broad categories intended to “prepare students for civic engagement,” teach students to think morally and ethically, and train students to be flexible academically.
Similarly, members of a Committee on the Study of Undergraduate Education at Stanford recommended significant changes to the school’s undergraduate curriculum in 2012, most of which the university has since adopted.
The review recommended doing away with required humanities courses called “Introduction to Humanities,” colloquially known as “IHUM,”  and instead introduced a new set of requirements called “Ways of Thinking/Ways of Doing.” These new general education requirements, like those at Harvard, require students to take courses from eight interdisciplinary categories.
“The idea is to link the humanities experience with something that is a core part of your normal academic experience, but broadens it,” says Spiegel, who in the 2010-2011 school year chaired Stanford’s faculty senate—a body of elected faculty members that discusses and votes on university affairs and grants degrees.
“So rather than taking a kind of general western history or philosophical course, you would take philosophical ethics linked to problems in biology,” he said.
He adds: “We think that will  be more interesting and relevant to the person taking it and will broaden their point of view.”
Campbell, who co-chaired the committee that reviewed Stanford’s undergraduate requirements, says that members of the committee visited other campuses to learn about peer undergraduate education programs, including that of Harvard, which at the time was a few years into its new Program in General Education.
Harvard’s program includes categories like Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding, Ethical Reasoning, and Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning. Stanford’s program, which its faculty passed in May of 2012 and implemented for the class of 2017 the next fall, includes categories like Aesthetic and Interpretive Inquiry, Ethical Reasoning, and Applied Quantitative Reasoning.
Harvard English professor Derek Miller, who earned his Ph.D. from Stanford in 2013, says Harvard has been a crucial model for Stanford as it reevaluated its undergraduate curriculum.
“I saw [Stanford] rethinking what an undergraduate education looked like, and Harvard had already done that,” says Miller. “So if you’re looking at Stanford and saying ‘what is it that they’re doing, how are they going into the 21st century?’ the answer is they’re looking at what Harvard’s doing.”
Part of the intentions of both schools’ undergraduate education reviews was to reevaluate the role and application of humanities in a liberal arts education, which both Harvard and Stanford claim to offer their students.
Stanford affiliates say that because of the media coverage and attention on Silicon Valley and the tech world, their arts and humanities are not as recognized in the shadow of prodigious science and engineering programs.
“We don’t fool ourselves,” Saller says. “When students out of high school are applying to college, Stanford probably isn’t the first place they think of when it comes to the humanities, especially if they’re on the East Coast.”
According to Saller, about 250 of about 1,700 degrees awarded last year were in the humanities and arts, though he says that this number may be misleading.
“The fraction of our students in the humanities looks low by comparison, but students who are doing interdepartmental programs are often studying a great deal in the humanities, it’s just not that that’s their formal nature,” he says.
In recent years, Stanford has pushed for greater visibility and student participation in the humanities. For example, this fall, the computer science department introduced a new joint major called “CS+X,” which will encourage students to pair computer science with a humanities discipline like classics, english, history, and music, among others.
But because Stanford disposed of its mandatory humanities courses, some say students can get away without ever studying the humanities.
“Stanford doesn’t force them on anybody,” says Rishi Bedi, a sophomore at Stanford studying computer science. “It’s very easy to graduate from Stanford without doing any in depth studies of the humanities.”
For example, students can take “The Public Life of Science and Technology,” a course that focuses on “social, cultural, and values issues raised by contemporary scientific and technological developments through STS interdisciplinary lens” for Aesthetic and Interpretive Inquiry credit.
Though Stanford students generally say that the humanities do have a voice on campus, student vernacular highlights the tensions that exist between the hard sciences and the humanities.
Students speak jokingly of a “techie-fuzzy” divide, with “techies” referring to those who study the hard sciences and “fuzzies” referring to those who study social studies and the humanities.
“I think that encapsulates the feeling on campus, that humanities students are these wishy-washy, artsy people who maybe don’t add anything to the campus,” says Orman, himself a history concentrator.
While both universities have reevaluated their respective undergraduate curriculums in recent years, Stanford administrators claim that their university balances its emphasis between undergraduates and graduate schools. By contrast, some, like Gardner, say that the balance of power between Harvard’s professional schools and the College is a pressing issue.
Many point to Harvard’s physical campus, which comprises 5,083 acres and stretches from Harvard Square to its Longwood Medical campus in Boston, as an indicator of the fragmented nature of the University. Most departments in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—home to Harvard College—are housed in the Yard or on offshoots of nearby Oxford Street. From the Yard, students and faculty must cross the Charles River and walk 15 minutes to arrive at the Business School, between which highways, non-Harvard shops, and restaurants interrupt the campus. SEAS’s planned move to Allston will only add to this disjuncture.
“One real advantage that Stanford has is that we’re all on one campus,” says Spiegel. “[At Harvard] the administrative structure was like the geography. One nice thing about Stanford that I really like is that we are on one campus, and we are a part of the functioning of the university.”
Helen M. Blau, a professor at Stanford’s Baxter Institute for Stem Cell Biology, says that this has important ramifications for research.
“The whole campus is integrated, and proximity makes a huge difference,” Blau says. Blau, who received her Ph.D. in cellular and developmental biology from Harvard, remembers catching a bus to attend lectures at Harvard Medical School’s Longwood campus, located in Boston.
“I would go to lectures at the Medical School, but that would take so many hours out of your day just going back and forth,” she says. “Everything is close here. That makes a huge difference whether you will interact with people and collaborate with them.”
But more damning is Spiegel’s assertion that unlike Stanford, Harvard focuses its energies on its graduate and professional schools.
“Harvard tends not to emphasize undergraduate education,” he says. “Stanford used to be like that but about 20 years ago, we put more and more emphasis on the quality of undergraduate teaching, and we got senior faculty to participate in it.”
But Faust and those involved in Harvard’s capital campaign are committed to the idea of “One Harvard,” in which the 12 schools will collaborate through research and teaching.
Kenen, for her part, says the university should focus on how to bring the professional schools into the undergraduate environment.
“Students are very eager to be taught by somebody in the Business School,” she says. “But how can we bring what someone does at the Business School into a liberal arts education?”
With Stanford’s shifting focus on the humanities, existing strength in engineering, and steadily more-recognizable name brand, the higher education world at large seems to be questioning whether or not Harvard truly will be the leader in learning and research in the 21st century.
“Harvard has always been the gold standard,” says Damon. “Stanford and every place will always look to Harvard as being the pillar, the pinnacle.”
However, he says, “things are changing.”
“There are signs that Stanford is coming on pretty strong,” he says, mentioning the contagious energy Stanford manifests and its geographic location in California, at the “cutting edge.”
“It’s true that there is a kind of West Coast spirit about being able to do more and new things without necessarily losing the things that we’ve been doing from the past,” says Berman. “I find that really quite energizing.”
Blau points to college admissions as a sign of Stanford’s progress.
“It used to be that it was a no-brainer, you would go to Harvard,” Blau says. “But now it’s really a choice that people struggle to make when they get into both. We’re proud of the advances we’ve made, because Harvard was always number one.”
Lue, however, defends Harvard’s prominence, especially when it comes to its undergraduate yield. Though Stanford had a lower acceptance rate for the Class of 2018, 82 percent of incoming freshmen accepted to Harvard chose to attend, as compared to 78.9 percent for Stanford.
“Shouldn’t the Harvard students and the Stanford students be the same? [They] are not. We get eight out of ten of [them],” he says. “That means that there is only 20 percent of the people we chose distributed across all of the other leading schools.”
Faust also notes that students accepted to both schools generally choose to attend Harvard.
“I know what our cross admits are. We do much better,” Faust says. “More people who are cross-admitted come here than go to Stanford by a considerable margin.”
Though Stanford has exponentially risen the ranks in the past two decades, Miller says that Harvard’s storied past will always distinguish it from other American colleges.
“[Harvard] is used to being a leader on these fronts,” says Miller. “Stanford’s going to have to deal with the weight of that.”
Miller glances through the window of his bottom-floor Barker Center Office, in front of which, framed by red and gold leaves characteristic of a New England autumn, packs of students holding binders and backpacks shuffle to and from class.
“Stanford still thinks of itself in the process of becoming,” Miller says, chuckling quietly to himself. “Stanford’s still a startup.”

UPDATED: October 30, 2014, at 3:30 p.m.
Several streets in an around the Square were temporarily shut down Wednesday evening, as a caravan of vehicles and limousines carrying Vice President Joseph R. Biden to and from a nearby fundraiser passed through Cambridge.
Biden was scheduled to attend a private fundraising event at a Cambridge home for Representative Carol Shea-Porter of New Hampshire and Seth W. Moulton '01, according to his public calendar. The event was scheduled for 5:30 p.m., though the Vice President’s caravan appeared to be running late.
It followed an afternoon of Bay State campaigning on Moulton’s behalf. Biden was also scheduled to be at an event in Boston for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Martha Coakley by 7:30 p.m., according to the White House.
The fundraising event in Cambridge marks Biden’s second appearance in town in recent weeks. Earlier in October, Biden discussed foreign policy at the Institute of Politics, where his sister, Valerie Biden Owens, is a fellow this semester.

UPDATED: October 30, 2014, at 1:25 a.m.
“No one should have to carry the weight alone,” read one of dozens of hand-written messages written on a mattress that students carried around the Yard Wednesday afternoon. The students were just a few of many who participated in “Carry That Weight,” a nationwide campaign to express support for victims of sexual assault.
The day of action, which took place on more than 130 college campuses, was sparked by the activism of Columbia University student Emma Sulkowicz, who has spoken publicly about being sexually assaulted and has vowed to carry her dorm mattress for as long as the alleged perpetrator attends Columbia.
According to Brianna J. Suslovic '16, the mattress is a tangible representation of the impact of rape, and the act of collectively shouldering its weight is a symbol of the importance of community support and advocacy for sexual assault victims.
“The idea of human connection is sometimes not as clear when people are caught up in their own lives, their own worlds, their own schedules,” Suslovic said. “To see people take time out of their day today, carry something heavy together, and make it lighter for each individual person—there’s a lot of powerful symbolism in that.”
In addition to the “mattress carries” held throughout the day, students wore red Xs and purple ribbons to raise awareness. In the evening, some gathered outside Memorial Church to reflect on the day’s events. In Eliot House, residents distributed articles about Harvard’s culture regarding rape, such as an op-ed published last spring in The Crimson.
Kara J. W. Lessin ’16, who organized activities in Eliot House, said she feels the day of action is significant because it prompts individuals to think and act against sexual assault.
“A lot of the spirit of the day is about the personal decision to take [sexual assault] on,” she said. “Even though a lot of it is [about the] collective carry, there has to be the personal decision to say, ‘this is a thing that I care about.’”
Although several student groups promoted and participated in the event—including Our Harvard Can Do Better, the International Women’s Rights Collective, Harvard Men Against Rape, and Consent, Assault Awareness and Relationship Educators (CAARE)—participants said that no singular group took the lead in organizing.
According to CAARE member Ariane Berelowitch ’15, members of the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response were also present throughout the day to show their support and answer questions.
Emily M. Fox-Penner ’17, an organizer of Our Harvard Can Do Better, said that although the event helped draw attention to the struggles sexual assault victims endure, the conversation on sexual assault must continue beyond a single day.
“It’s really important that we have this physical manifestation, but it’s also important that we recognize that this is an isolated manifestation of a very sustained problem,” Fox-Penner said. “Emma is carrying this mattress every day of the school year.”
Jack C. Smith ’15, a member of Harvard Men Against Rape, also noted the need for continued advocacy against sexual assault.
“Everyone has a role to play here, and we all can do a little bit more to make sure that this issue gets the attention that it deserves,” he said.

The United States must react to the threat posed by the Islamic State of Iran and Syria with humility and sensitivity to local concerns, the former U.S. Ambassador to Syria said Wednesday afternoon at a seminar at the Kennedy School organized by Harvard’s Middle East Initiative.
Robert S. Ford—who was recalled from his post in Damascus three years ago due to an assault by a pro-government mob—emphasized the desire for human respect motivating the tumult in both Syria and Iraq.
“This [conflict] really is not even about democracy,” he said. “What’s driving this is the demand by the population for dignity. Now, how you get there: that’s the challenge.”
During the conversation, which was moderated by Kennedy School professor R. Nicholas Burns, Ford expressed skepticism at the prospect of rallying Sunni, Shia, and Kurdish Iraqis against ISIS due to the tense and occasionally violent relations between the groups.
“With the policy to mobilize all of the Iraqis together to fight the Islamic State, there’s some big problems getting Sunnis to buy-in right now,” he said. “I am not sure [the U.S.] will to be able to do this, and certainly not without more pressure.”
As the discussion shifted to Syria, Ford was similarly pessimistic regarding the U.S.’s ability to re-orient the anti-government opposition forces to focus their efforts on ISIS instead of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.
“The idea that the people who've been fighting Assad suddenly will be changing their mind and saying, ‘oh, Bashar is not so bad; we have to fight the Islamic State?’ That is a fantasy,” Ford said. “If given the choice between fighting the Islamic State and fighting for Assad, most of these people will join the Islamic State. That’s the grim view.”
When Burns asked whether President Obama’s vocalized goal to destroy ISIS was misaligned with the current reality of a lack of ground combat forces, Ford responded that the battle against the Islamic State would involve an ideological conflict, as well as military force.
“How do you destroy an idea? How do you destroy a movement? That’s not just a military problem,” he said.
Ford, who resigned from the ambassadorship in March due to personal disagreement with the Obama administration’s Syria-related policies, stressed that the government should proceed with extreme sensitivity given its incomplete knowledge of the situation.
“I think it’s important that we not stumble into the trap we often do of Americans making foreign policy without reference to foreigners,” he said. “I hope this administration does not forget…to address the challenge of dignity, and the challenge of hope.”

Many students who have sought peer tutoring from the Bureau of Study Counsel this fall are still waiting to be assigned tutors as the semester draws on, due in large part to high demand and a shortage of tutors.
The Bureau of Study Counsel, which provides tutoring and counseling services for students, is currently in need of on-call tutors for large, lecture-style and introductory courses like Economics 10a: “Principles of Economics,” Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I”, and Math 21a: “Multivariable Calculus,” among others, according to peer tutors and emails sent by the Bureau requesting additional help.
While BSC does not turn students who need help away from its services, it puts potential tutees on a waiting list until a tutor becomes available, according to Ratna Gill ’16, who has sought tutors this fall for both Economics 1010a: “Microeconomic Theory” and Economics 1123: “Introduction to Econometrics.” Gill said that she signed up to receive a tutor for both of these courses during shopping week and has yet to be assigned a tutor.
“It’s not really a denial so much as ‘we’re still looking,’” Gill said, noting that no tutor materialized even as she neared her first midterm.
BSC Associate Director Sheila M. Reindl wrote in a statement that while student demand does not seem any higher than last year, “it is not uncommon” to see a shortage of tutors. She also wrote that “the College does not release information about tutoring use and availability for specific courses.”
With requests stacking up, some student tutors say the need for tutors seems higher than usual.
“I actually think it’s way worse this year than last year,” said China R. Cardriche ’16, who tutored in math and economics last year in addition to this year. “Being a tutor, you want to be able to help all these people, but you know physically you don't have enough time in the day, so it is going to feel like you're not meeting the needs.”
According to peer tutors, the Bureau has been trying to recruit on-call tutors, who help students in specific classes over the course of a term, by sending numerous email requests daily. BSC has also brainstormed additional recruitment methods in tutor-wide meetings.
“It doesn't seem like the BSC really recruits for tutors as much as they should,” said Ronald D. Laracuente ’17, who tutors in Life Sciences 1a: “Introduction to the Life Sciences.” “A few tutors suggested that we go into a class [in sequence] right after Ec 10, LS1a, or something, and ask those students to tutor, but that doesn’t really happen.”
He added: “ I feel like if there was a litte more recruiting, this problem would be solved.”
According to the BSC website, about 400 students work as peer tutors in a typical year. Students must have earned an A or an A- in a course to be eligible to become a tutor.
Sietse K. Goffard ’15, a tutor in economics, said that recently the BSC has tried to coordinate with department advisers and professors to recommend students to tutor courses. Some professors, like Economics 1010a professor Jeffrey A. Miron, said they are reaching out to students who took their courses last year to solicit help.
Yet despite efforts to find more tutors, the problem persists, and will only make it harder for students in need of assistance as the semester goes on, according to Cadriche.
“There are all these people out there in need of clarity and help,” Cardriche said. “To not have that just creates more stress.”

Experts disagreed whether tension between China and the U.S. in the East China Sea has the potential to escalate to global conflict on the scale of World War I by Oct. 2015 at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum on Wednesday night.
Disagreement between Japan and China over possession of a small group of islands in the East China Sea has mounted in recent years.
During the discussion, moderated by Belfer Center Director and Harvard Kennedy School Professor Graham T. Allison ’62, panelists compared geopolitical conditions today and 100 years ago, at the outset of World War I.
Etel L. Solingen, political science professor at the University of California at Irvine, said war between the U.S. and China is unlikely. Though she called China “the rising power” in contemporary world politics, she noted that Germany under Kaiser Wilhelm in the early twentieth century had goals to dramatically expand its reach.
Kennedy School professor Richard N. Rosecrance said that though war is possible, it is unlikely to break out by 2015. He added that while there is competition between the U.S. and China for control in the East China Sea, this tension would not necessarily end in full scale war.
“The key difference between now and then is that you can have conflicts among your allies, even among your navy vessels,” he said.
Kennedy School Professor R. Nicholas Burns said that though war is “highly improbable,” he did not entirely rule out the possibility. According to Burns, world leaders at the advent of World War I did not foresee how alliances between countries would lead war to spread across Europe. Similarly, today’s political elite, he said, may underestimate the commitment of U.S. support of Japan.
Audience members said they found the event’s focus on China to be relevant.
“I think it was a very timely discussion and given the state of affairs is one that is worth talking about,” said Kennedy School student William A. Eberle. “[The discussion] focused very heavily on China at the expense of other countries,” he said, noting that World War I involved many international alliances.
Joshua S. Lipsky, also a student at the Kennedy School, said he appreciated the event’s coverage of both military and economic relations.
“You have to have these discussions. China is a major partner, not just a major threat,” he said.

A national poll conducted by Harvard’s Institute of Politics has found that millennial voters are now significantly less supportive of President Barack Obama and the Democrats now leading Congress than they were four years ago.
Millennials as a whole, including those who did not identify themselves as likely voters, indicated that they favored Democratic candidates in the upcoming elections by a seven-point margin. But according to the recent poll, young Republicans plan to outvote their Democrat counterparts by a 12-point margin.
Of the 26 percent of 18- 29-year-olds who indicated that they would definitely be voting in November, 51 percent said they would prefer Republicans in charge of Congress, while 47 percent would prefer Democratic control.
Those figures reflect a eight percent shift since 2010, when only 43 percent were for the Republicans and 55 percent of the cohort indicated that they would prefer Democratic control.
The poll indicates that the shift towards Republicans may be due to rising disapproval of Obama. According to the IOP poll, only 43 percent of young Americans approve of his job performance. That number is only two percent above the lowest rating Obama has received since taking office—41 percent during 2013.
Among likely voters, Obama’s job approval rating was 42 percent, while 56 percent said they disapprove of his performance.
Race was also a powerful indicator of whether millennials supported the president. Young African Americans continue to show strong support for Obama with a 78 percent approval rating, more than double the 31 percent of their white peers who approve of Obama’s job performance.
That means that there is a 47-point gap between Obama’s approval rating among African Americans and among whites, a striking increase from five years ago when the margin was 36 percent.
As for Congressional control, 53 percent of young white respondents said they would prefer that Republicans control Capitol Hill, while 40 percent favor the Democrats. The political inclination is reversed among young African Americans, with 68 percent favoring a Democrat-led Congress and 23 percent preferring Republican control. Hispanic respondents also preferred Democratic control, with 59 percent in favor of Democrats and 34 percent for the Republicans.
The slide in Obama’s approval rating was particularly evident among Hispanic millennials. According to IOP analysis, it has reached its lowest since 2009. Only 49 percent of Hispanic millennials now support Obama, a dramatic change from the 81 percent who approved of his job performance in November 2009.
The poll, which was conducted between Sept. 26 and Oct. 9, was based on responses from 2,029 participants across the United States.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
History Professor Mary D. Lewis will make a motion at Tuesday’s meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences requesting that University President Drew G. Faust and the Harvard Corporation reverse a set of controversial changes to non-union employees’ health benefits plans announced earlier this year.
Lewis filed the motion with the Office of the Secretary of the Faculty last Tuesday. Yesterday afternoon, the Faculty Council docket committee, which sets the agenda for monthly Faculty meetings, approved Lewis’s request and placed it on Tuesday’s agenda, according to Classics professor Emma Dench, vice chair of the docket committee.
Lewis said that several other Faculty members have indicated that they will rise to voice their support following the motion. If the motion passes—by a majority vote of the present Faculty members—Faust would not be compelled to make any changes to the benefits plans, but the request would carry the formal support of the full Faculty.
The motion, as filed, asks “that for 2015 the President and Fellows be asked to replace the currently proposed health care benefit plan with an appropriately adjusted version of the 2014 health benefit package, maintaining the 2014 plan design.”
It is the first formal action taken by a group of faculty members critical of the new packages, which are set to take effect next year.
Lewis and several other faculty members have said that they primarily take issue with the introduction of deductibles for non-routine health appointments and the institution of copays up to $4,500 a year for families. They argue that the new plans are “regressive” and will disproportionately burden junior faculty members and faculty members with families.
Citing these grievances, Lewis asked Faust at last month’s Faculty meeting how and when the announced changes would be reversed. Her question drew significant applause from other faculty members in the room and a detailed description changes’ justification from University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76. Lewis subsequently said Garber’s response—which tied the changes to rising healthcare costs nationwide and within the University—did not address the core of her question.
Faust, for her part, indicated that she maintains her support for the new plan in an interview earlier this month. She commended the University Benefits Committee for the care it put into designing the plan, which she said was only finalized after 55 meetings of the committee.
Defending these changes, Faust said that in the past other changes to the policy have been made to mitigate effects on employees, but that in order to sustain a “generous” policy, more visible changes had to be made.
“We've done some adjustments, some very well-devised adjustments, that have not been visible to the faculty and staff, and we've just run out of those options,” she said.
Faust also challenged the assertion that the policy is “regressive,” saying, “we have quite explicit provision for lower-income employees, lower-income reaching quite high actually in what is defined as lower-income to mitigate the impact of these, and I think that prevents it from being regressive.”

Although a recent study found that colleges often fail to provide adequate concussion education programs for their athletes, students and administrators at Harvard say that the College has adhered to detailed guidelines for treating and identifying concussions.
The study, conducted by Harvard researchers Christine Baugh ’10, Emily Kroshus, Daniel H. Daneshvar, Naji A. Filali, Michael J. Hiscox, and Leonard H. Glantz, found that although 92.7 percent of universities reported having a system for head injury management, only 76.1 percent of those institutions taught their athletes how to identify concussions.
According to National Collegiate Athletic Association guidelines, schools are required to conduct “an annual process that ensures student-athletes are educated about the signs and symptoms of concussions.”
The researchers also revealed that member institutions were not required to inform the NCAA that they had a concussion management plan, leaving it up to member schools to self-report if they choose to.
Chris J. Nowinski ’00, a former Crimson football player and executive director of the Sports Legacy Institute, a nonprofit seeking to further awareness about concussions, agreed that colleges are still lacking in terms of educating athletes before the injuries occur.
“It’s clear that educating athletes is not a high priority,” Nowinski said.
A professional wrestler for World Wrestling Entertainment until he suffered a traumatic blow to the head that ended his wrestling career, Nowinski helped the Ivy League construct its new concussion policies over the past few years. Their provisions have historically been stricter than those of the NCAA, such as contact practice restrictions that go beyond the baseline NCAA mandate.
However, even with the proper education given to Crimson athletes about identifying head injury symptoms, accurate self-diagnosis is not guaranteed.
Harvard football players Jacob Mayes ’18 and Mark N. Goldman ’18 experienced their first concussions early this semester. However, they said they did not immediately realized that they had sustained a concussion until they were approached by a trainer.
After Harvard's medical staff gave the correct diagnosis, both were kept from participating on the field. According to Goldman, he was not allowed to do contact drills until cleared by the sports medicine team even after being asymptomatic for a week.
“[After the injury] my trainer would not let me even go down to the field, for [about] a week and a half,” Goldman said.
According to Crimson football coach Tim Murphy, Harvard's policy is to defer decisions to sports medicine staff when it comes to medical issues, including concussions.
“We’ve got a tremendous sports medicine staff,” Murphy said. “They really care about the kids, and their decisions are going to be what’s best for the student-athletes.”
According to Lindsey Baker, the communications officer for Harvard University Health Services, Harvard also has a support system in place that goes beyond the comprehensive medical services the university provides.
“The student's resident/freshman dean and the Accessible Education Office are also notified, in case the student needs academic support, which is consistent with the NCAA’s best practices,” Baker said.
The new policies, along with the formation of a comprehensive student support system, led to a major shift in concussion management at Harvard.  Due to the negative stigma surrounding concussions, Murphy said, athletes often failed to report their suspicions of suffering from head injuries.
“Now you encourage kids to [report their symptoms], even if it turns out not to be anything remotely like a concussion,” Murphy said. “You want to make sure you’re on the conservative side.”

UPDATED: October 30, 2014, at 1:20 a.m.
University officials defended Harvard’s decision to pay only slightly more than 50 percent of the $4.3 million the city of Boston requested to offset the cost of municipal services in fiscal year 2014, citing its long history of “consistent” and “reliable” monetary contributions, in addition to direct programming, that benefit its Cambridge and Boston communities.
The request came from Boston’s “payment in lieu of taxes” program, which calls for voluntary payments from nonprofits that have at least $15 million worth of property. While the program was created in its current form three years ago, Harvard officials pointed out that the University has made PILOT agreements with the cities of Boston and Cambridge dating back to 1928. In the past 10 years, Harvard has made over $45 million in PILOT payments, $20 million of which went to Boston and $25 million to Cambridge.
Local government officials criticized the University for failing to fulfill the whole request, referring to what they said can feel like a “one-sided” sense of appreciation.
“Clearly Cambridge benefits from having Harvard, MIT, and Lesley in our city. But those universities also benefit from being here,” said Mark McGovern, a Cambridge city councilor. “The frustration is that you’re talking about a university—this isn’t John Smith vocational school. Harvard has more money than many third-world countries. They are going to be expected to do more.”
Leland Cheung, a Cambridge city councillor, also noted that the property Harvard has acquired over the last decade in Allston represents funds removed from the city’s tax roll.
“This is a constant tension of whether or not our nonprofit universities are carrying their weight in utilization of city services,” Cheung said.
While each institution is asked to pay 25 percent of the taxes it would have paid if it were not tax-exempt under the PILOT program, the nonprofit can then reduce that amount by up to 50 percent as part of a “community benefits credit” by providing other services to the community.
Harvard officials argued that the amount the University pays under Boston’s PILOT program is not indicative of all that Harvard gives back to the community, citing examples like the Arnold Arboretum and financial aid scholarships for students from the city.
“One size doesn’t fit all and just to give an across-the-board 50 percent credit for programming does not even begin to capture the volume of programming that Harvard and other institutions provide,” said Harvard Vice President for Public Affairs and Communications Kevin Casey. “It undervalues what institutions are doing and undervalues what the city of Boston is capturing from institutions doing great things and sometimes in partnership with the city.”
Richard Doherty, president of the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities in Massachusetts, echoed that the 50 percent credit did not adequately address the diversity of higher education institutions in Boston and their consequent variation in community involvement.
“You can’t come up with a single formula that will fairly be applied to that much diversity. We did not like the formula, but we were OK with [it] as long as there was a recognition that the payments were going to be voluntary,” Doherty said. “There’s no inconsistency in our position and there’s no inconsistency with a school paying exactly what the formula suggests they pay, pay less than it, or decide not to pay at all.”
Casey also pointed out that although Harvard is tax-exempt due to its non-profit status, the University still pays taxes on property that is not used for educational or research purposes. Over the past 10 years, Harvard has paid nearly $60 million in taxes to Boston and over $50 million to Cambridge in addition to the documented PILOT payments.
"We think there needs to be an appropriate balance. We believe in PILOT payments,” Casey said. “We believe it is in our interest for the city to be very strong and vibrant and helps us attract students, but yet we need the flexibility to do other things.”
According to city data, higher education institutions widely varied in committing to the voluntary payments—while Boston University paid $6 million out of a requested $6.5 million, Northeastern University paid none of a requested $2.5 million.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One year ago, the Harvard women’s rugby team overcame Dartmouth in the Ivy League championship to take home the title in its inaugural varsity season. This weekend, the Crimson travels to Hanover, N.H. to defend that title.
Fourth-seeded Harvard (3-3, 3-2 Ivy) will take on an undefeated Brown (6-0, 5-0) squad on Saturday. If victorious, the Crimson will face the winner of the Dartmouth-Princeton semifinal on Sunday.
“We are excited as a team,” co-captain Kaleigh Henry said. “We were excited last year going into Ivies, so going back into that arena, we’re taking a step back, looking at what mentality we need to bring. I think a good word to describe the team right now is very focused.”
Harvard is familiar with the Bears, having lost to them, 24-15, earlier in the season in what was Brown’s closest game of the year.
In that Sept. 13 meeting in Cambridge, the Crimson held a 15-12 lead over the Bears late in the second half before conceding 12 unanswered points to the visitors while playing a man down due to injury. Outmatched in size, Harvard still proved to be Brown’s toughest opponent of the season.
In last year’s Ivy League championships, the Crimson rolled past the Bears, 31-5, in the semifinals before pitching a 29-0 shutout against a Dartmouth team that, like Brown, was previously unbeaten and had defeated Harvard earlier in the season. The Crimson hopes for the same results this weekend.
Harvard is a very different team than the one that brought home the championship last season and the squad that suffered a defeat to the Bears last month.
For many Crimson rookies, Saturday will represent their first playoff experience and first time facing off with Brown.
These rookies have increasingly shouldered key roles for the team and have earned more playing time as the season has progressed.
“We have acquired a lot of new players,” co-captain Brooke Kantor said. “There will be new faces on the field. These rookies have a lot of heart, a lot of drive. They love the game, and I think that’s going to be apparent to everybody that watches them. They’ve got a lot of talent.”
Even with the injection of young talent for Harvard, defeating the Bears will be no easy task.
Brown has outscored its opponents by an average of almost 48 points per game and has not lost a contest since it fell to the Crimson in the Ivy League championship semifinal last November.
A key component of the Harvard game plan for Saturday will be containing the Bears’ strong offensive front line, a task that is much easier said than done against a squad that has averaged nearly 58 points in its six games this season.
“Practices have been going well,” Henry said. “The team has been working hard [and is] very focused on our goals for this weekend.… We’re focusing on ourselves and on our game plan. If we play our game, that’s all we can ask of the team. I have every faith in the team that if we come out and play our game, we will be rewarded.”
This weekend represents a test for the Crimson’s six seniors, who have seen the team grow from a club program into a varsity sport over their four years. Henry, Kantor, Aniebiet Abasi, Moyia McTier, Lenica Morales-Valenzuela, and Taz Ramirez hope to fill the void of the ten Harvard seniors who led the team to the title last year.
For this group of veterans, the Ivy League championships present an opportunity to demonstrate they can lead the team to its second title in as many years.
“It would mean the world,” Kantor said. “There is nothing more that I want in the world right now. Every day I am thinking about this Ivy championship. I think it would be such an accomplishment because it would make me feel as though I, as a senior and as a captain, was able to inspire my team to work that hard and to earn that title of champion.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­If you passed a bus heading from New Jersey to Cambridge on Saturday night with the soulful tunes of Frank Sinatra booming out, don’t be surprised. According to Harvard football coach Tim Murphy, after road victories, the offensive linemen will sing anything on the bus ride home, from “Sinatra to rap.”
“It’s amazing, it sounds pretty good,” said Murphy about the linemen singing.
The Harvard football team certainly had good reason to sing all the way home from Princeton on Saturday.
“Sometimes it goes your way, sometimes it doesn’t,” Murphy said of the contest in the postgame press conference.
This year, it finally went the way of the Crimson (6-0, 3-0 Ivy). Harvard completely dismantled the Tigers (3-3, 2-1) on both sides of the ball—Saturday’s 49-7 victory at Princeton Stadium looked remarkably little like the triple-overtime loss of last season.
Two years ago, when the Crimson gave up 29 points in the fourth quarter and watched a victory slip away, it was Murphy who was befuddled by his team’s utter meltdown.
This time around, it was Princeton coach Bob Surace’s turn to say, “Everything that could go wrong, did go wrong.”
With the Tigers rushing attack taken away by the Harvard’s stout defensive front seven, Surace turned to his two quarterbacks—Connor Michelsen and Quinn Epperly—to move the chains. But the quarterback duo that put up an average of 304 yards passing over the last two years against Harvard couldn’t break 200 yards this time around against a secondary that graduated most all but one starter last year.
In fact, the Tigers offense seemed more style than substance for most of the game, running unusual two-quarterback schemes, which featured reverse plays that seemingly completed more backward passes than forward ones. At one point, Princeton lined up Epperly against senior defensive end Zack Hodges, certainly not the matchup Surace had in mind.
Surace elected to go for a fourth-and-five deep in Harvard’s territory midway through the third quarter, when the Tigers trailed 35-0. Michelsen found wideout Connor Kelley for the first down, but a chop block on the otherwise-promising play brought it back. Princeton was hit with a 15-yard penalty, and it became time to punt—one of the 12 times Princeton was forced to punt on the day.
Michelsen connected again with Kelley for a 27-yard bullet on the next drive—the longest offensive play yet for the Tigers—and Surace’s squad appeared to be potentially making a dent in the 35-0 hole it was in. But on the very next play, Michelsen’s screen pass ended in a forced fumble when junior defensive back Asante Gibson punched the ball out and recovered it.
And so on. Things weren’t going well on defense either for Princeton. Harvard senior quarterback Conner Hempel, finally healthy from a back injury suffered in the Crimson’s first game of the season, appeared to have oiled his jersey in preparation for the Tigers’ pass rushers. Orange and black jerseys swarmed him, and it seemed inevitable that Hempel was going down.
Then suddenly, almost as if by magic, No. 14 would emerge, roll out, and throw a pass. No sack, and touchdown, Harvard.
The Tigers sent two free blitzers on a third down and finally brought down Hempel in the second half, but one of the defenders grabbed Hempel’s face mask on the way down. No sack, 15-yard penalty, and a few plays later, Hempel jumped over his offensive line into the end zone for one of his five scores. Touchdown, Harvard.
Princeton’s defense finally got to Hempel for one sack, but it was too little, too late. For the majority of the game, the offensive line gave Hempel plenty of time to throw, and throw he did—the senior ended the day with a career-high 382 yards and three touchdowns through the air.
Along with helping Hempel to a career day, the offensive line made the nation’s third-best rushing defense look downright average. After the game, Surace, who previously coached offensive linemen in the NFL, noted that at least two members of Harvard’s o-line could play professionally.
Harvard’s offensive linemen certainly appeared to live up to Surace’s praise, as the running back corp tallied over 300 yards rushing thanks to a few explosive runs from junior Paul Stanton and freshman Semar Smith.
Watching the game almost felt like a disappointment—an anticlimactic event after the drama of the past two years. But disappointment was definitely limited to a writer hoping to witness a good game of football.
For after their performance Saturday and sweet revenge on Princeton—two years in the making—finally enacted, the offensive linemen surely sang all the way home.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Success begets confidence.
On the heels of its fourth straight conference championship, the Harvard men’s basketball team was selected in the Ivy League preseason media poll as the unanimous choice to finish first in the league for the 2014-2015 season, conference officials announced Wednesday.
Harvard has been the unanimous choice two years in a row after the departures of Brandyn Curry ’13-14 and Kyle Casey ’13-14 knocked the Crimson down to second two years ago. This will mark the third time in four seasons that the Crimson has finished first; Harvard accumulated 16 of 17 possible first-place votes in 2011-2012.
Over the four-year stretch, the Crimson has lost just eight league games. Last year’s team lost just one game while posting a 13.3-point average margin of victory—statistically the league’s strongest champion in a decade. Harvard set program records in both overall wins (27) and conference victories en route to the NCAA Tournament, where it defeated Cincinnati in the first round before falling to Michigan State in the round of 32.
This year’s team brings back reigning Ivy League Player of the Year Wesley Saunders alongside two-time All-Ivy selections and co-captains Steve Moundou-Missi and junior Siyani Chambers. Senior center Kenyatta Smith—the team’s starting center two years ago—returns after missing nearly the entire 2013-2014 season. Sophomore Corbin Miller, who looked like the team’s best three-point shooter at Crimson Madness, is back after two years on his Mormon mission.
Following the Crimson in the poll were Yale and Columbia, each of which boasts an All-Ivy caliber frontcourt talent in Justin Sears and Alex Rosenberg, respectively. Princeton, which hasn’t finished outside the top three since the 2007-2008 season, was picked to finish fourth following the departure of All-Ivy first team guard T.J. Bray.

This Halloween, Lady Liberty is getting a gaudy new accessory for her 125 year old outfit: a Joe Boxer bow tie. In the spirit of the holiday, we started to think up costume ideas for our dear friend John Harvard. We have great ideas on how to dress as Harvard for Halloween, but what should John Harvard himself be?
1. Boxed wineA Harvard favorite! Although Franzia didn’t exist when Harvey was built in 1884, we think he would have been a natural at “slapping the bag.” A cardboard box might not be the sexiest, but it might be the classiest.
2. A urinalConsidering how many students urinate on poor John’s foot annually, and how many accomplish this feat on Hallow’s Eve alone, it only seems fitting that he accepts his own destiny.
3. Yale’s better, older brother With the recent news that Yale may likely adopt CS50, it might be nice to publicly display how we’ve taken on the role of guiding our fallen brethren in the right direction. A cute (stuffed) bulldog sitting on John’s lap should do the trick.
4. Conner A. Hempel '16This star quarterback came back to the football field a month late after a back injury, and lead us to an astonishing 49-7 win over Princeton this past weekend. Hopefully this costume can bring us good luck for the BIG GAME! T-minus 24 days!
5. Himself Let’s be honest, John already looks good in his “simple clerical garb of the 17th century,” cast in bronze with a funky gold foot. He doesn’t need an ostentatious Halloween costume to fit in with the crowd, he can simply be himself.

Good morning, Harvard! It’s Thursday, which means it’s going to be Halloween really soon or maybe you’re even starting your festivities tonight! In the midst of midterm, paper, and perhaps sheer laziness (don’t worry, we’re not judging you at all), maybe you don’t have a Halloween costume yet and are desperately in need of a really easy one! Here are some last-minute Halloween costume ideas:
1) Lamonster: Draw dark circles under your eyes (or maybe they’re natural dark circles from all that sleep deprivation, yikes?!?), have greasy “I haven’t had the time to shower in so long” hair, a venti cup of coffee which you’ve been spending all your BoardPlus on, and hold a laptop in your hands (all the Lamont *pros* know not to take your whole bag when taking a break for dinner because who has time for a bag check when you’re going to come back anyways?).
2) French Fries: Wear a yellow top, grab a group of friends who are loyal enough to also wear yellow tops and follow you around at every party, and cut out red cardboard paper in the shape of a french fry container to put in front of everyone in time for pictures because pics or it didn’t happen obviously (this idea was stolen from American Apparel).
3) Red Dot, Yellow Dot, Green Dot: Self-explanatory as you and two friends can dress up in red, yellow and green– a versatile outfit since you can either be traffic lights which is kind of boring to be honest or the new HUDS health labels (aka built-in convo starter at parties once someone asks what you are).
4) Abercrombie model: Douse yourself in their signature perfume or cologne and either go shirtless like all the male models on their bags or wear any form of Dunster apparel.
IN THE ATMOSPHERE
It’s going to be a nice day today! It’ll be sunny all day with a high of 58 and a zero percent chance of rain, yay! Fingers crossed that the weather stays like this for the Halloween weekend (Halloweekend?)!
