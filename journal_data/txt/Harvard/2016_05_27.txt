After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Each
spring, the ballot for the Harvard University Board of Overseers regales us
with formulaic tales of career success, celebrity, and wealth. In good Harvard
spirit, short narratives are crafted around stories of service and charity.
While there are exceptions, the marketing I suspect can too easily belie the
careful path taken to recognition and position, and the definitions employed to
count “service” seem
generously broad. And lest her students and alumni think that life after
Harvard is all chairmanships, championships, cabinet appointments, technology
buy-outs, and estate planning, the University would do its community a very
great and real service by raising a ballot inclusive of her single moms,
stay-at-home dads, small-scale artists, struggling poets, middle school
teachers, and those whose record of service is truly central to their lives,
with all its risk, returns, sacrifice and financial consequence.
There is
a stubborn pattern by which we bestow honors on those who have meticulously
plotted their careers, and one might suspect in many cases more for enrichment,
advancement, and celebrity than for service. More and more, it seems we’ve
surrendered to an outcome that turns on how the game is played — on the
attention sought on social media platforms and the relentless pursuit of
connections, awards and fellowships with their multiplying power of celebrity.
The very great pity in this, and the disservice to Harvard in this case, is
that there are so many great minds and hearts still within her reach but
quieter in their pursuits, who are too busy doing and serving to be plotting,
climbing and promoting — and whose contributions to her direction and reach
could be incalculable.
Let’s
champion our alumni, or at least include them, whose service is truly central
to their lives, and an indissoluble mark of their character and deep personal
commitment — those otherwise unsung, working behind the front lines of our
cities, our schools and our world, not on occasion through Board appointments
and weekend volunteering, but as the core thread of their lives. Harvard may
not know many of these alumni because they’re not in the halls of her clubs or
on her travel tours, or at her high donor tables, but that’s reason enough to
make a change.
We can
rebalance the honor roll. Harvard is such a truly remarkable institution, and
her alumni are as rich in diversity, cause, contribution — and accomplishment —
as our admissions themselves evidenced. While this year’s ballot had some
original additions and the candidates are to be warmly congratulated on their
success, too little seems to change by way of the profile of the ballot.
Let’s
extend a hand further out. The honor of serving on Harvard’s Board should not
default to being the crowning jewel of a tireless, well-crafted ascent to
position, power, influence or wealth. It can be something more meaningful — it
can be an unsought honor, and one that lifts a life of service, whether to
family, community or charity, to the recognition it deserves. We can bestow the
honor on someone whose brand is an accident of merit and not a strategy of
celebrity.
Life
after Harvard is beautiful, and hard. There is grief, loss, struggle, illness
and disappointment. And for those who have committed their professional lives
to service, there is the weight of bearing witness and the sobering reality of
its demands. Let’s have the courage to write the real bios, the ones that tell
the fuller story. Our lives are a testament to the strength and depth of our
spirit, and our capacity to allow forth the gifts buried in life’s inevitable
loss and hardship. Harvard’s resumes can be hard to distinguish between, but
her real bios are not. And in their honesty and vulnerability, Harvard can find
her best inspiration.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the Editor:
A recent Crimson article emphasized that, at least from the perspective of the Harvard Department of Mathematics, “talent in mathematics is identifiable at a young age,” thereby creating the picture of the theoretical mathematician as a child prodigy whose genius was discovered early on. This portrait was further emphasized with the suggestion that moving to more applied math would increase diversity. The lack of diversity in the department, combined with this assertion, seems to imply that pure math is a talent possessed only by those lucky enough to be white and male.
In fact, the image of the child prodigy mathematician is deeply flawed: The field of pure mathematics is littered with brilliant minds who were not child prodigies or even "identifiable talent" at 20 or older, people like Albrecht Fröhlich, Joan Birman, Edward Witten, Stephen Smale, George Green, or Leonard Susskind, among others. In fact, Fröhlich received his Ph.D. in mathematics at 35, and Birman at 41.
Worse, not only does this notion reinforce a racist and sexist stereotype that has been repeatedly proven incorrect (shockingly, white male brains aren’t actually superior at math), but we also ignore a huge amount of mathematical talent when we adhere to this idea.
Even though this idea of the stereotypical mathematician has been around for centuries, we do have it in our power to reverse this perception. To change the current climate of diversity in mathematics, we need to continue to move forward with the positive steps that the University has already begun to make. Current initiatives include revamping advising to increase accessibility to the concentration in mathematics, and policy changes to create a more inclusive environment within the math department spaces—the goal is to a create a math department that is welcoming to all, not just to white male prodigies.
I hope that the math department has begun and will continue to understand that there is no stereotypical math student or faculty member, and that when we buy into these ideal portraits of mathematicians, we are neglecting so many great mathematicians to the detriment of the field itself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earlier this month, 200 women, under the banner of #HearHerHarvard, rallied in the Yard to protest Dean Khurana’s sanction of unrecognized single-gender organizations. Chanting “sexual assault is not our fault,” they seemed to argue that this sanction unfairly penalizes women for a problem predominantly perpetrated by men.
This sentiment baffled us: it demonstrated #HearHerHarvard’s misguided understanding of rape culture.  As founders of the Our Harvard Can Do Better campaign, we write to clarify how rape culture operates and how it complicates the responsibility of community members. We are not calling all women in sororities and female final clubs perpetrators. We also acknowledge that certain survivors have found support within these organizations, while others have not. Rather, we call into question the wider Harvard community’s role in perpetuating a toxic campus culture in which one in three women is sexually assaulted.
When we first started organizing in 2012, it had seemed that sexual assault was no one’s responsibility. In private, students were aware of unsafe spaces and knew of a friend or a friend of a friend who had been assaulted. Publicly, obligatory consent awareness workshops gave a cursory nod to a campus-wide problem that prevailed, but was systematically silenced.
This silence was telling. It reflected students and administrators' willful erasure of the prevalence of sexual violence. To better understand this culture of erasure, we spent six months meeting with representatives from over 30 sociocultural student organizations. Survivors from various communities expressed their fatigue at how no one knew what to do: Administrators were clueless about Title IX procedures, such as no-contact orders, academic extensions, and residential accommodations. Survivors who filed formal complaints described the process as obscure and found the burden of proof stacked against them. Students from marginalized communities shared how administrators and mental health providers lacked cultural awareness of their identities. Most instructively, students objected to the lack of inclusive, welcoming environments on campus and pointed to the exclusive social spaces run by men, like final clubs and fraternities, as especially unsafe.
These conversations informed us of the complexity of rape culture. At the individual level, intimate partners enact violence. #HearHerHarvard neglected to see beyond this level. At the institutional level, Harvard fails to comply with Title IX standards by making survivors’ rights inaccessible and allowing rapists to graduate every year without accountability. At the community level, students create cultural norms that enforce gender binaries, maintain the dominance of male spaces, and erase survivors’ experiences. Gender-based violence can cease only when the individual, institutional, and community levels are addressed in tandem. We had a daunting task before us but we persisted because we imagined a better Harvard--one that is safer and more just.
After countless unsuccessful meetings where task forces, deans, and administrators refused to take responsibility, we filed a Title IX complaint in the spring of 2014. Since then, Harvard has begun to undertake steps at the institutional level by amending its policies and procedures: the administration has appointed Title IX coordinators, required mandatory sexual assault training for House staff, and diversified the staff members at the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response. However, the administration’s efforts could not get to the root of rape culture until it tackled our campus’ normalization of predatory behavior. We thus welcomed Dean Khurana’s sanction as an institutional action which aimed to disrupt these cultural norms.
#HearHerHarvard, however, resisted the sanction as an unjust scapegoating of women’s spaces, citing that they are not at fault for sexual assault. Women in unrecognized single-gender organizations may not all perpetrate the assaults, but they facilitate the predatory social dynamics that enable violence to occur. The dominance of male clubs and fraternities relies on continued buy-in from female clubs, sororities, and the greater campus community. Standing in active allyship means thinking beyond one’s own experience with these organizations to understand their role in creating and maintaining unequal and unsafe norms. With the sanction, the administration is finally willing to take action after long denying the intertwined history of single-gender organizations and gender-based violence. But are students?
Sexual assault is our fault. Rape culture functions on individual, institutional, and cultural levels; thus, responsibility as an ally requires practice that addresses all three. On an individual level, we need to believe survivors’ stories and call out the abusers in our lives. On an institutional level, we must continue to advocate for an affirmative-consent policy and transparent complaint procedures. On a cultural level, we must eliminate sexist, racist, and classist power structures to create inclusive and safe environments. The sanction is a powerful use of Title IX that provides the wider Harvard community with an opportunity to reflect on our own complicity in perpetuating rape culture.
For the past four years, students have tirelessly organized for a safer and more just campus. Our Harvard can be better, and this sanction moves us closer.

Kate Sim ’14 and Pearl Bhatnagar ’14 founded Our Harvard Can Do Better,  an undergraduate campaign working to end the institutional and cultural enablers of sexual violence at Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Until recently, I have been proud of my alma mater’s efforts to seriously address the issue of sexual assault on its campus. The final report written by the Task Force on the Prevention of Sexual Assault describes Harvard’s problematic culture regarding dangerous alcohol consumption and sexual assault. Indeed, it is time for a cultural change across all levels of the campus.
This pride faded when I read Dean Khurana’s proposed sanctions against members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations. These sanctions aim to create a more inclusive campus and decrease sexual assault—an aim that I wholeheartedly support. But I am concerned by the way in which Dean Khurana’s proposal shifted focus away from preventing sexual assault to the membership policies of these organizations. I fear that because these sanctions were not created in collaboration with undergraduate students and faculty, the sanctions will harm Harvard’s efforts to reduce sexual assault on campus.
Scientific frameworks suggest that complex social problems must be approached through collaboration. Such engagement better defines the underlying causes of the problem, better creates policies that work with groups’ existing social norms, and better facilitates the implementation solutions. In a report on preventing sexual violence on college campuses, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends programs to reinforce positive social norms. Nowhere in the CDC’s report does it recommend sanctions against single-gender social organizations.
Dean Khurana’s proposed sanctions also contradict a central theme throughout the Task Force’s recommendations to prevent sexual assaults: engagement of all parts of Harvard’s campus. The report concludes by stating: “without the active engagement of the students in the culture they help create and sustain, any effort to bring about enduring transformation on this campus is unlikely to work.” Contrary to President Faust and Dean Khurana’s affirmations of collaboration, students and alumni feel that Harvard’s administration has been unwilling to engage single-gender social organizations in co-creating solutions for sexual assault specific to each organization.
The relationship between the administration and single-gender social organizations is inherently tense because these organizations do not meet Harvard’s criteria for student groups to be recognized organizations. Some of Harvard’s single-gender social organizations have sought to become recognized student groups, but the administration rejected these efforts.
Because single-gender social organizations are not officially recognized by the College, the Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services and the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention & Response have a limited ability to work with the organizations in sexual assault prevention and alcohol harm reduction programs. For example, DAPA Grants (a harm-reduction program run by the Drug & Alcohol Peer Advisors) cannot provide food at parties hosted by unrecognized single-gender social organizations because the clubs are considered to be off-campus. As such, single-gender student organizations do not have access to programs that empower students to change the culture of their organizations without paternalistic oversight. The ironic consequence of Harvard’s student group policy is that its administration is unable to effectively work with the groups identified by Task Force as needing greater prevention efforts.
Harvard could demonstrate its desire for working with students to decrease sexual assault by changing its policy on recognized student groups, thus providing single-gender social organizations with the option to officially work with Harvard. The University need not fear losing government funding with such a policy given that Title IX does not restrict universities from recognizing single-gender social organizations. This would align Harvard’s policies with those of universities around the country, including its peer institutions. Yale recently released a report suggesting that its administration recognize Greek organizations to create a culture of accountability and transparency, and to foster a collaboration with students to benefit their health and wellbeing.
Harvard, however, has decided to dictate students’ culture and place sanctions on members of single-gender social organizations who are prone to leadership. Harvard should let those student leaders drive a positive cultural change on campus.
Imagine an open forum moderated by Dean Khurana in which members of social clubs create a unified solution to create a healthy and inclusive culture on campus. As Harvard alumna Catherine Katz ’13 described, these community conversations would provide students an opportunity outside the classroom to learn frameworks for approaching complex social problems. This would uphold Harvard’s mission to create an “an unparalleled educational journey that is intellectually, socially, and personally transformative.” This sort of dialogue, however, is only possible if Harvard’s administration creates a more trusting and collaborative relationship with its single-sex social organizations.
In the meantime, I encourage all students and alumni to start this dialogue by writing to President Faust and Dean Khurana. I have sent a copy of this article to them both and look forward to receiving their responses.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a sunny and spirited Tercentenary Theatre, Harvard awarded 7,727 degrees and 11 certificates during its 365th Commencement exercises Thursday morning, including 1,661 degrees to Harvard College students and 988 to students in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
Beginning with an exuberant declaration of order from the sheriff of Middlesex County, the ceremony featured a number of student speakers before the traditional conferral of degrees. The deans of each of Harvard’s 12 schools conferred the degrees, and University President Drew G. Faust commended the now-graduates on their scholarship. 
As audience members fanned and shaded themselves with programs, the robe-clad students waved gavels and globes, among other objects, when their respective schools were addressed.
Three students took center stage to deliver the customary orations. Anne A. Power ’16, in the Latin Salutatory, discussed the particularities of the Harvard vernacular—the “Thesaurus Linguae Harvardianae”—while graduate student Jiang He spoke about the need to spread medical technology to developing countries.
Joshuah B. Campbell ’16 delivered the undergraduate English address, titled “Sorry, Not Sorry”; he encouraged his fellow graduates to be true to themselves.
“We obsess over whether or not every fiber of our being is ringing in tune. I have a fear: I fear that I don’t know how to live life authentically because I’ve spent so much time trying to make a perfect version of myself,” he said.
“It’s high time I learned to live without apology,” he added. “Being authentic requires it. It means not apologizing for the imperfections because those imperfections make up our beautiful differences.” 
Nine notables also received honorary degrees from the University: Ghanan artist El Anatsui; civil rights lawyer Mary L. Bonauto, former president of Brazil Fernando Henrique Cardoso; Yale historian David B. Davis; biologist Elaine Fuchs; biographer Arnold Rampersad, astrophysicist Martin Rees; MIT philosopher Judith Jarvis Thomson; and famed filmmaker Steven A. Spielberg, whose introduction was punctuated by brief musical odes to his cinematic career.
Spielberg was scheduled to later deliver the Commencement address in the Afternoon Exercises.

University President Drew G. Faust outlined a vision for a university education that shapes a student’s character and values—not just their intellectual and professional development—in her annual Commencement address Thursday afternoon.
Speaking before thousands of new graduates and their families during the annual Afternoon Commencement exercises, Faust also decried the “tumultuous state of American politics,” and ticked through a list of world crises.
“It is as if we are being visited by the horsemen of the apocalypse, with war, famine, natural disaster, and yes, even pestilence,” Faust said.
Faust then turned to the role of the University in such a contentious global climate. Juxtaposing Tercentenary Theatre’s Widener Library—“a monument to reason and knowledge”—and Memorial Church, dedicated to the Harvard students who fought in World War I, Faust concluded that universities should seek to instill a sense of morality and responsibility in its students, not just a dedication to intellectual inquiry.
“With the rise of the research university in the late 19th and early 20th century, moral and ethical purposes came to be seen as at odds with the scientific thinking transforming higher education,” Faust said. “But in today’s world I believe it is dangerous for universities not to fully acknowledge and embrace their responsibilities to values and to service, as well as to reason and discovery.”
In addition to calling for a focus on the moral development of students, she advocated for crafting policies that reflect these goals.
“In myriad ways, we challenge our students to be individuals of character, as well as of learning,” she said. “We seek to establish standards for the college community that advance our institutional purposes and values.”
Faust’s decree that universities should shape their students’ values comes amidst a debate on campus over recently-announced sanctions for members of single-gender social organizations like final clubs, fraternities, and sororities. A number of critics, including a slate of professors and some alumni, have charged that the sanctions, which— beginning with the Class of 2021— will bar members of the organizations from holding leadership positions at the College or receiving fellowship endorsements, run counter to the aims of a liberal arts university.
Beyond emphasizing the importance of character cultivation in her 15 minute speech, Faust also criticized what she described as the increasing tendency to ignore the truth and the facts in contemporary discourse.
“These are the bedrock of education, and of an informed citizenry with a capacity to lead, to explore, to invent,” Faust said. “Yet this commitment to reason and truth, to their pursuit and preeminence, seems increasingly a minority viewpoint.”
Faust’s commencement address more explicitly laid out a vision for the University’s future  than her speeches in recent years; in 2015, she warned against distrust in institutions, while in 2014, she put forth a case against sequestration and research spending cuts.
“Harvard is and must be a community of idealists,” she said.

In a wide-ranging and “unapologetically sentimental” Commencement address, filmmaker Steven Spielberg reflected on his own career in cinema and challenged Harvard’s most recent graduates to follow their intuition, find someone to love, and fight hatred through human connection.
Spielberg called on graduates to follow their intuition and avoid falling prey to overwhelming “voices of authority.” Drawing upon his own path to a career in film, Spielberg compelled graduates to follow their gut.
“I realized that a movie could also be a mission,” he said. “I hope all of you find that sense of mission. Don’t turn away from what’s painful. Examine it. Challenge it.”
Spielberg—renowned for films including Jaws, the Indiana Jones series, and Jurassic Park—opened his address by congratulating the recent graduates gathered in Tercentenary Theatre and recalling his own long-delayed graduation: he dropped out of college in 1968, before completing his degree more than 30 years later.
“They gave me course credit in paleontology for the work I did on Jurassic Park,” Spielberg joked.
Decrying the proliferation of phone and computer screens, Spielberg then encouraged everyone in the audience to turn to someone new and make eye contact, drawing nervous laughter and a few handshakes.
“That emotion you’re feeling is our shared humanity, mixed in with a little social discomfort,” Spielberg said. “But if you remember nothing else from today, I hope you remember this moment of human connection, and I hope you had a lot of that over the past four years.”
Continuing the theme of connection, Spielberg encouraged the Class of 2016 to fall in love and hold onto friendships. He criticized hatred, calling for the “villains” of the world to be vanquished with “more humanity.”
“To me, and I think to all of you, the only answer to more hate is more humanity. We have to replace fear with curiosity,” he said. “We’ll find the ‘we’ by connecting with each other and believing we’re members of the same tribe, and feeling empathy for every soul.”
“Even Yalies,” he added.
Spielberg, many of whose films are historical period dramas, also stressed the importance of studying and understanding history to the graduates and wished students a “Hollywood-style happy ending.”
“I hope you outrun the T-Rex, catch the criminal, and—for your parents’ sake—maybe, every now and then, just like E.T., go home,” he said to finish his address.
