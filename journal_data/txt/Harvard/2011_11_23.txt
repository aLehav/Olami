“This is really fucking cool,” announced Mikel Jollett, lead singer of The Airborne Toxic Event (T.A.T.E.), four songs into his band’s set last Saturday at the Boston Orpheum. I admit I had to agree.
Before the band had even taken the stage, they were already eliciting cheers. Lead singer of opening act The Drowning Men, Nato Bardeen, told the crowd that a drunk driver had run into the group’s van the night before. “Our van was totaled and The Airborne Toxic Event picked us up at 5 a.m. God bless them and their beautiful hearts.” As the song started, T.A.T.E. stormed the stage with their other opening act, Mona, and plenty of alcohol. As The Drowning Men finished their last song, T.A.T.E. members Jollett and violist Anna Bulbrook set the raucous tone of their show by pouring bottles of liquor into the guitarist and vocalist’s mouths.
After the rest of the group had joined the two members on stage, they opened their show with the rousing “All at Once,” which featured Bulbrook rocking out on viola. Suffice it to say the audience response was deafening. After, Steven Chen’s keyboard solo led the group into the eerie duet “Half of Something Else,” on which Jollett shared lead vocals with Bulbrook. By way of explaining his group’s enthusiasm, Jollett said, “The first time we played here was for Franz Ferdinand. You know, Anna’s from Boston, so this is a big deal.” In keeping with the somber mood they played the lyrically beautiful “A Letter to Georgia” and a cover of Magnetic Field’s “Book of Love,” which benefitted from Jollett’s emotionally charged delivery.
The set picked up with the energetic “Wishing Well,” which perfectly exemplified the group’s effective use of classically inflected string parts in addition to standard rock orchestration. The chaotic moments become more chaotic and the somber moments become more somber thanks to Bulbrook’s stately melody lines.
Jollett’s showmanship was the driving force behind the group’s general enthusiasm. After a performance of “Numb,” he fearlessly climbed onto the balcony section to serenade Bulbrook’s parents, and during “Does This Mean You’re Moving On?” he made his way into the audience by high fiving and hugging multiple fans. With his performance of those songs and “Gasoline,” Jollett showed that sometimes a lack of vocal precision can be salvaged through unbridled enthusiasm and charisma. “Welcome to Your Wedding Day,” however, fell flat—instead, Jollett’s screaming was swallowed up by the intensity of the band.
The ethereal, now four-year-old, “Sometime Around Midnight,” which was the group’s first hit, clearly remains a fan favorite—and for good reason. It hinges on an impeccable execution of T.A.T.E.’s signature sound: a melding of moody U2-like soundscapes and the fiery passion of indie rockers. Upon hearing Bulbrooks’s opening notes, the crowd erupted and sang every lyric.
T.A.T.E. left the stage amid thunderous applause, which did not end until Jollett and Bulbrook came out for an encore. “There’s no story more true than this,” Jollett said as he and Bulbrook began to sing the acoustic “The Graveyard Near the House.” Bulbrook’s viola once again made the already somber song even more haunting. The rest of the band joined them for a performance of “Innocence,” which also drew its initial melancholy from a glorious pairing of Harmon’s upright bass and Bulbrook’s viola before easily transitioning into a high-energy rock piece.
T.A.T.E. left the stage again, but just like before they came out after about five minutes of screaming and applause. During their second encore, they performed “Missy,” a song off their first album. Jollett waxed nostalgic, reminiscing, “I wanted more than five people to like this song who weren’t my family. I didn’t know any musicians and then I met all of these fucking great people. This song is about you as much as it is about us.”
Near the end of the concert Jollett stared into the crowd reflectively and said, “I’m not going to pretend this isn’t a big deal.” It would be foolish to do so.

As the newest star on the rap scene, Canadian rapper and hip-hop artist Drake is on top of the world. Yet Drake’s sophomore album is not boastful; “Take Care” is a contemplative collection that, surprisingly, conveys its wisdom and insight more through the subtleties of Drake’s language than through its production. It’s an incredibly personal album, and many tracks are carried by recordings of phone conversations and plainspoken rap rather than by beats alone. For a genre that is known for its obsession with wealth, women, and power, it’s refreshing and exciting to see an artist approach it with the confidence and maturity that Drake delivers in his self-aware and stylish manner.
His songs take an introspective approach to deconstructing his celebrity, and the way he presents this dilemma simultaneously sets him apart as a rapper and reinforces his place as a top-tier artist. On single “Headlines” he says, “Money over everything, money on my mind,” seemingly falling into line with other rappers, but in a turn he follows up with, “Then she wanna ask when it got so empty / Tell her I apologize, it happened over time.” The lyrics are not complex or difficult to grasp, and thus it’s easier to understand the emotions that form this more complex persona. We don’t get a two-dimensional rap star, we get a vulnerable, intelligent man conflicted because he is perceived as nothing more than his superficial public persona. His understated way of showing the flaws in glamour, like when he says, “I might be too strung out on compliments / Overdosed on confidence,” belie a skewering self-awareness absent from most. Instead of hiding the importance of his lyrics behind complex stylized delivery, his candor makes his verses that much more direct. He lets the words speak for themselves, allowing the grandeur of his beats to emphasize the straightforward raps he constructs. He creates a portrait of a self-destructive lifestyle that makes him seem both seriously flawed and incredibly powerful at the same time.
However, for all its strengths, the album does have a tendency to fall into some of the familiar and almost tired tropes of rap, at times even his more introspective verses seem superficial rather than profound. Songs like “HYFR” and “Practice” perfectly embody this fault. While the other songs deal with issues of love and relationships in an honest and realistic way, “HYFR” is a generic rap song about nothing but having sex and saying “Hell yeah!” and the same holds true for “Practice.” The few superficial and misogynist songs on “Take Care” are oddly incongruous. They act as deadweight that obscures Drake’s self-reflexivity. It can be distracting at times to hear lyrics like “live a little, ’cause niggers die a lot,” followed up by lines like “if you ask me what I care about: / Rap and bitches” or “come on honey, back that ass up.”
“Doing it Wrong,” the twelfth track on the album, succeeds because Drake’s lyrics take precedence over his delivery and thus showcase Drake’s ability as a songwriter. The simple repeating beat doesn’t eclipse the lyrics, and instead creates a stark stage for Drake’s solemn song. It’s heavy with melancholy, and lets Drake’s heartfelt frankness create one of the most emotionally engrossing rap ballads of the album. It’s only when he lets his guard down and allows the rap to take pride of place over the music does the album demonstrate Drake’s maturity and his impressive ability. “Take Care” illustrates the potential Drake has to be a lasting figure in the rap world. Let’s just hope he realizes he doesn’t have to act like the other rappers to sell albums.

Sigur Rós is not a band that does anything small. Even the Icelandic post-rock outfit’s most spare tracks are fraught with unspoken emotion on a huge scale, to say nothing of the sprawling epics such as “Hoppípolla” for which the band is most known. Textured by bowed guitar, insistent percussion, and slowly transforming arrangements, and carried to new heights by frontman Jon “Jónsi” Birgisson’s flawless falsetto, Sigur Rós has always created songs and albums that sound more like aural manifestations of intense feeling than anything else.
They haven’t released any new music for three years, since 2008’s “Með suð í eyrum við spilum endalaust” (“With a Buzz in Our Ears We Play Endlessly”); they went on hiatus after playing their last show at London’s enormous Alexandra Palace in the same year. For that last show in London, they were filmed by Vincent Morisset, and they turned the subsequent film and recording into “Inni.”
At an hour and 45 minutes of music and an hour of film, “Inni” is a massive release. But its duration is appropriate considering the depth and breadth contained within it. There has always been something unfulfilling about Sigur Rós’s studio albums, as if the clean production and mastering took away from the music’s impact and suffocated it a bit. “Inni,” then, is Sigur Rós at its most fully realized: the music can breathe like it never could before.
For a select few tracks, the overwhelming bigness that dominates the sound of “Inni” diminishes their efficacy. The minute-long crescendo of “Inní mér syngur vitleysingur,” which on “Við spilum” started from the hushed notes of piano and celesta and built to the most explosive finale of the entire album, feels on “Inni” like it has no foundation from which to build. It loses too much of the spine-tingling propulsive emotion of the original.
Fortunately, though, live treatment enables the four members of Sigur Rós to extract new depth in the overwhelming majority of the tracks. The opening “Svefn-g-englar” is not the mellow, removed slow jam as it was on “Ágætis byrjun;” the booming acoustics of the hall, combined with the addition of distorted guitar, give the song a weight and a momentum that wasn’t there before. And where “Sæglópur” felt compressed and tight on “Takk...,” here it feels towering and expansive.
And they also play brilliantly off the energy of the crowd. In “Festival,” for example, Jónsi holds a single trembling note for—count it—48 seconds. After the first 20 seconds, the audience begins to cheer, then dies down; as soon as they realize that he’s still holding the note after another 20 seconds, they go nuts. At the peak of their excitement, the band breaks into the drivingly energetic second half of the song.
By nature, this album displays the consistency of their output across a lengthy career. Longtime fans of Sigur Rós won’t be disappointed with the album’s scope: though the focus is on tracks from “Við spilum,” “Inni” contains songs from every album since and including 2000’s “Agætis byrjun.” It effectively serves as an assertion of their continued relevance, even after their absence.
Finally, in addition to being a perfectly tuned retrospective on Sigur Rós’s work thus far, “Inni” closes with a brand new track called “Lúppulagið.” It’s an ethereal, atmospheric track centered around a simple piano melody and characteristic bowed guitar, reminiscent of “Untitled 1 (Vaka)” or “Untitled 3 (Samskeyti)” off of “( ),” Sigur Rós’s 2002 album. “Lúppulagið” is brooding and melancholy in its affect as it slowly blossoms then fades away into silence.
It’s a fittingly calm way to cap off an album that, for the simple fact that it’s a live recording played by real human beings, packs more raw force and emotional power than any previous Sigur Rós release. Finally, these songs’ potential has been fully realized on record.

Kate Bush has never embraced the normal. On her new album, “50 Words For Snow,” she continues her three-decade long tradition of embracing the weird with haunting passion and brilliant song craft. Now taking as inspiration snow and its many connotations and associations, Bush has produced a uniquely remarkable album, with style, content, and structure at once fascinating and beautiful, yet strange and somewhat inaccessible.
“50 Words For Snow” is comprised almost entirely of abnormally long songs, each clocking in between six and 10 minutes each.  They would perhaps best be described as minimalist sagas. While the length provides a larger canvas for artistic expression and experimentation, it also makes it easy to lose track of the song itself, as many of the melodic motifs are repeated for many minutes without much variation. Unlike most of her past work, which featured songs of more standard pop lengths with more easily identifiable melodic lines, the epic indulgent ambience of her most recent work is at first hard to grasp. The album requires more focus to fully discern all there is to appreciate in the subtle instrumentation, calmly passionate vocals, and poetic content of the songs.
Bush uses the expanded form of her songs to craft products with a tremendous deal of lyrical depth. For decades, she has been lauded for her ability to write unpretentious songs inspired by vastly different sources—whether cultural or literary—and she continues to do so to stunning effect, now in even longer form. The sagas told in “50 Words” include those of the ghost of a crazy woman and her dog in “Lake Tahoe,” the yeti and those who try to protect him from others in “Wild Man,” and two lovers whose paths have crossed time and again only to be separated at pivotal moments in human history in “Snowed in at Wheeler Street.” Though they go on for a very, very long time, all three are not only beautiful musically, but also lyrically.
Bush’s description of her songs as having “a background of falling snow” is exactly the thematic impression given by the album’s somber elegance and simplicity. Most of the tracks, some more overtly than others, center around topics related to snow and winter. All are triumphant examples of Bush’s usual creativity in crafting lyrics with wonderful imagery from unique sources of inspiration. Opener “Snowflakes” takes the perspective of its titular object and chronicles its journey earthward past people, forests, and animals. Under beautiful lyrics, the piano—which seems to be Bush’s instrument of choice throughout the album—and occasional intertwining of snare drums, violin, and guitar create an ambient musical landscape of lightly falling snow.  It is a beautiful evocation of a pristine winter’s calm.
Throughout the album there is also an understated sense of humor. In the title track Bush counts while actor Stephen Fry lists what are apparently 50 different words for snow, yet the sound of words like “whippoccino”—which could easily be a Starbucks drink—or “faloop’njoompoola” when pronounced and accented with the utmost seriousness results in an amusing juxtaposition.  Tragic “Misty” remains humorous because, though a story of lost love, the object of affection is a melting snowman.
When she first appeared on the British music scene in the late ’70s, one of Bush’s most remarkable traits as an artist was her expansive vocal range. Though the range is less pronounced, the richness of her voice and the varied emotions she conveys through it is one of the most impressive elements of her most recent work and at times is what holds the musically meandering songs together. Her voice soars at dramatic moments into her upper range in a disconcerting yet powerful dissonance, and then grows low and gravelly with urgency and desperation. This variety allows her to give life to multiple characters within each song, adding to the musical and narrative complexity.
“50 Words For Snow” is a strange album. Its instrumentation is minimalistic, the melodies hard to grasp, and the lyrics often meandering and soulful. But it is also a brilliant compilation that showcases some of Bush’s best creative tendencies. The songs are as much works of art and poetry as they are music, and as such they require patience—patience that absolutely pays off.

After 30 seconds of vaguely electronic noise, a cathartic explosion of synthesizers teetering on the edge of abstraction ignites a propulsive yet understated rhythm section. Through it all cuts a female voice—here whispering sensually, there defiantly ushering the song through its bridge and exhorting the chorus to begin. This is “Knew You Well,” the debut single and opener for the first, self-titled album by Brooklyn-based duo Cultfever. The band is on the verge of something, and on the strength of this early material, they’re poised to become a very big deal indeed.
“We’re really pleased with the way it’s been going,” says J. Peter Durniak, the group’s main instrumentalist and the man behind Cultfever’s dense, noisy soundscapes. “We were really happy to get the album out.” Tamara Jafar ’09, the lead singer, shares his satisfaction. “We had our heads buried under the ground for two years working on this,” she says, and the intensity of this process is apparent in the record’s layered production values and polished final result. Listeners might be skeptical of yet another New York-based indie-pop band, but Cultfever’s focus, post-punk vibe, and Jafar’s distinctive vocal performance suggest a band ready to break apart from a saturated genre.
Their influences might be easily traceable—as Durniak readily admits his influences—but his description of every song as a melting pot is apt. You can detect the currently in-vogue ’80s British New Wave, but this now popular sound is nuanced by slivers of trip-hop, shoegaze, and weirder post-punk influences from bands such as The Chameleons and Echo & the Bunnymen. All of this adds up to a surprisingly fresh package: an appropriate adherence to traditional pop hooks and structures refracted through a self-awareness that steers clear of navel gazing. Blessedly, the band have also managed to avoid the po-faced portentousness that other modern groups of this type seem unable to shake—think Interpol and The Killers. As Jafar says, “we want you to feel a sense of sincerity, but maybe also a sense of humor.”
The band’s commitment to live performance is also encouraging. They relate their experience of working together, and the bond they feel writing music, to the connection between themselves and their audience when onstage. “We interact in a way that feels good, and we get to do it live,” Jafar says. The relationship between the two of them is also crucial to their success: you can feel it in the way guitar and voice seem almost fused as they kick in simultaneously on “Strangenecks,” or in the space Jafar leaves for a synth solo on “Duress.” “We think a lot of the same things on the same song,” Durniak confides. “The style emerged while we were working together organically.”
Jafar also mentions that the experience of being at Harvard played an important role in getting her to this point. Although she was not heavily involved in music while at school, Jafar identifies the broader environment of intellectual activity and curiosity as having had a major influence on her musical sensibilities. For Harvardians interested in seeing Cultfever play live, the band hopes to play a gig in Boston in early 2012. In the meantime, however, they are waiting to see how the album is received. “Both of us got into this conscious of the market we were entering,” Jafar says cautiously, and you can detect the band trying to downplay expectations, to disbelieve their own hype. With a winning formula like this, though, it should only be a matter of time before they go stratospheric.

Things just keep getting better for Harvard football coach Tim Murphy.
Just weeks after setting the program’s all-time wins record with his 118th victory at the helm of the Crimson against Columbia Nov. 5, and just days after leading Harvard to a dominant 9-1 season in which it finished three games ahead of any of its competitors for the Ivy League title, Murphy was named on Monday one of 20 finalists for the 25th Eddie Robinson Award, which honors the national coach of the year.
The honor was established by The Sports Network in 1987, and is voted on by a panel of over 150 Football Championship Subdivision sports information directors, broadcasters, and selected sports writers. It was named for College Football Hall of Famer Eddie Robinson, who led Grambling State University for 56 years and is the second-winningest coach in Division I history, behind only Joe Paterno.
“When you are nominated for an award like this it generally means you had a great team and it is a reflection of what your team (players and coaches) accomplished,” Murphy wrote in an e-mail.
Though the coach has a long way to go before matching Robinson’s length of tenure, Murphy has achieved unparalleled success during his 18-year run at the helm of the Crimson.
Including this year’s championship team—which scored the most points in Harvard history and ranked third in the nation in points per game—Murphy has won a total of six Ivy titles. In 2009, the coach capped a decade that saw the Crimson post the second-highest winning percentage in the FCS (.768) and seventh-highest in all of Division I, ahead of schools like LSU and USC. Every four-year player the coach has recruited has won at least one Ancient Eight championship.
2011 marked Murphy’s 25th year overall as a head coach, after having previously served in that position at the Universities of Maine and Cincinnati. His name has recently been linked to the Penn State coaching job that opened up after Paterno’s firing—rumors Murphy has denied—but he recently told The Boston Globe he plans to retire in the next decade.
The Robinson award will be presented at the national awards banquet in Frisco, Texas on Friday, Jan. 6—the night before the FCS national championship game. Murphy had previously been named a finalist for the honor in 2001 and 2004, his two perfect seasons.
Southeast Missouri State coach Tony Samuel garnered last year’s award, which no Ivy coach has ever won.

The Harvard men's hockey team overcame an early four-goal deficit and came away with a 7-6 victory over the University of New Hampshire Tuesday night at Bright Hockey Center.
The Crimson was down 4-0 after the first period and a 5-2 midway through the second, but scored four goals in the second period and then took control in the third.
Freshman forward Colin Blackwell scored the game-tying and go-ahead goals for Harvard (3-3-1, 2-3-1 ECAC) in the middle of the third period to put Harvard up 6-5 in this high-scoring affair. The Crimson withstood a late resurgence by UNH (5-6-2, 4-4-1, Hockey East) and hung on for the 7-6 win.
“It was quite a crazy game,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato '91. “Every puck that went towards the net had a chance of going in there for awhile. Being down 4-0 after the first, we just talked about giving ourselves a chance to be able to hold our heads high walking out of there.”
The first period just did not belong to the Crimson. The Wildcats came out strong and put two pucks in the net in just over five minutes. UNH freshman Grayson Downing capitalized on a rebound in from the right slot 83 seconds into the game and Kevin Goumas scored off a centering pass from Nick Sorkin on the power play.
“They had us on our heels early,” Donato said. “Even though they didn’t have to necessarily work so hard on a couple of their goals, you could really see their speed and skill.”
After a couple of soft goals, Donato decided to replace sophomore goalie Raphael Girard with freshman Steve Michalek. But this did not stop the UNH offense, as it was just one of those games where anything near the net had a chance of going in.
Downing scored another off a redirect and defenseman Trevor van Riemsdyk scored off a slap shot from the point. After four goals against in the first 12 minutes of the game, Donato called a timeout and the team seemed to settle down a bit after that.
And entering the second period, Harvard looked like a whole different squad. The team began to clamp down on the Wildcats fast-paced transition offense and earn some offensive-zone time for itself.
“We came into the first intermission, and a couple guys had their heads down,” Blackwell said. “But the older guys brought us back together and came together as a team and said hey, can’t get any worse than this.”
The Crimson’s first goal came early in the second on a power play goal from assistant captain Alex Killorn after a pass across the net from junior forward Marshall Everson.
“Once we got that first one the floodgates started opening, and we started to finally play like Harvard hockey,” Blackwell said.
A couple minutes later senior Eric Kroshus scored on a hard wrist shot from the left faceoff circle after a pass up along the boards from freshman defenseman Patrick McNally.
The comeback was delayed briefly by a shorthanded UNH goal by Goumas on a hard slap shot to the glove side after a broken-up pass.
“They might have gotten a little too comfortable,” Blackwell said. “But we already started coming back and we weren’t going to give up then so we just get kept fighting.”
The Crimson put two more in the net before the start of the third. Junior forward Alex Fallstrom scored from a pass from Killorn after a Wildcat turnover in the defensive zone.  Killorn then later scored himself, his second of the game, directing a pass from Fallstrom five seconds before intermission.
Cutting the deficit to one, Harvard entered the third period ready to attack and battle, playing what Donato believed to be its best period of the night.
Blackwell has shown some flash so far this season, but the two goals he scored to give the Crimson the victory were more of a testament to his effort.
The game-tying goal was put in off a rebound from a deflection by junior David Valek on a slap shot by captain Ryan Grimshaw. And Blackwell gave the team the lead on a redirect of a shot from sophomore defenseman Dan Ford.
“He really just competes,” Donato said. “He can skate and he’s got great skills, but he goes for the tough areas and he throws his body around. His style of play and his work ethic definitely gives our bench a big boost."
Valek added an empty-net goal to seal the win for Harvard, despite a last-second goal from UNH forward Stevie Moses.
Overall, Donato was happy with the resilient win as well the offensive spark for the Crimson in the last two periods.
“In the end of the day I think there’s something real positive for us in that fact that we were able to win game that we didn’t play perfectly,” he said. “We were able to score seven goals when quite frankly there’s been some times [when] that’s been a decent month for us.”
In what looked like a lost night for Harvard early on, the Crimson was able to turn it around and make this a confidence boosting victory.
“I’m really proud of the way the guys persevered,” Donato said. “It was a real uplifting night for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There’s no better way to end a three-game losing streak than with a dominating performance to quiet the critics.
The Harvard women’s basketball team (1-3) cruised to its first victory of the 2011-2012 season Tuesday night in its home opener against Rhode Island (1-4), 69-57, but not without a little trouble to start the second half.
With the intermission score set at 44-22 in the Crimson’s favor, the Rams came out firing, cutting the deficit to 12 with a little over 17 minutes left to play. But in the next five minutes junior guard Elle Hagedorn hit a pair of free throws and a jumper en route to her 14 points—a career-high—on the night.
Sophomore Elise Gordon then entered the game and mimicked her teammate. She was fouled, nailed two free throws, then following it up with a shot from close range. The center recorded a career-high 10 points in 15 minutes of action and helped create separation between the Crimson and the visitors.
“I wish I’d felt the same way about the second half that I did for the first half,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “Again, we have a lot to learn. I think we’re a very good team. ... We’re not a young team, but we’re not a totally old team. We have some youthful mistakes in our decision-making, and that happened in the second half.”
After shooting well in the first half, the Crimson did just enough to keep the Rams at bay in the second period, shooting a poor 25.8 percent and failing to make any of its 10 attempts from long distance. Harvard was outscored in the frame, 35-25, but the 22-point cushion from the first period was too much for Rhode Island to overcome.
The Crimson came out strong in the first half, quickly pulling away from the Rams. By 12:14, Harvard had built its first double-digit lead of the game at 18-8, after sophomore guard Christine Clark hit a quick jumper. The Crimson never looked back, finishing the half with a 22-point lead.
“Because we were playing at home, we were just so pumped up [from the start] and ready to get our first win,” Hagedorn said. “We were so hungry for that first win.”
Clark recorded a game-high 18 points, 16 of which were scored in the first frame. The sophomore almost had a double-double with nine rebounds on the night.
“I thought the whole half, our dominance started from our defense,” Clark said. “We were attacking them on defense, and then when we got on offense, we were really composed and looking for one another, seeing the cuts, getting the great shot—not the good shot—which I thought led to my points and the overall team’s performance.”
Rhode Island’s Ashley Rivera also reached double digits in the opening period, scoring 10 points on 4-of-7 shooting. The diminutive guard was particularly effective in the early going, keeping her team competitive every time Harvard tried to pull away. Rivera cut the Crimson’s 12-point lead to nine with a long three-pointer to bring the score to 25-16 with 7:57 to play.
Harvard did not let Rhode Island get any closer, keeping the visitors scoreless in the final 4:52 while putting up 11 unanswered points.
“The fact that we went up by 20 [points] was a testament to our defense,” Delaney-Smith said.
Poor shooting plagued the visitors in the first half, while Harvard was red-hot from the field. Rhode Island shot a measly 27.3 percent, while the Crimson hit 56.7 percent of its attempts. But after a drastically different second half, the shooting percentages evened out more, with the home team making 41.0 percent of its shots compared to the visitors’ 33.9 percent.
“I don’t think we came out with the defense mentality to attack them like we did in the first half, and they went on a little bit of a run offensively,” Clark said. “We then had to get back into a defensive mindset, but our shots weren’t falling on offense, so we needed to crash the boards more.”

Instead of watching Thanksgiving Day football games or televised holiday events, head out into Harvard Square this Thursday if you're around campus during the break to see what local vendors are offering for the day.
Thanksgiving Day:
Though the Adams House Dining Hall will be open for Thanksgiving dinner, students remaining in Cambridge could skip the HUDS offerings and try some of the new seasonal dishes featured at local restaurants instead.
Ever craved Roasted Misty Knolls Farm Turkey? Pumpkin Pasta Pillows? Maybe some Apple Spice Layer Cake? These are only a few of the many dishes offered around Harvard Square on Thanksgiving Day. Check out The Russell House Tavern, Harvest, Grafton Street, or UpStairs on the Square, which even boasts its own Vegan Thanksgiving Feast.
As for dessert, if you still haven’t quite filled your food coma quota just yet, consider heading over to Sweet for a Maple Cranberry cupcake, or to Finale, for a slice of their popular Chocolate Bourbon Pecan Pie or Eggnog Cheesecake. Or, to add some more turkey feasting into your day, try JP Licks' Wild Turkey Bourbon ice cream. Lizzy's Homemade Ice Cream and Berryline have also rolled out some of their own Thanksgiving-inspired treats for the holiday.
Once you've stuffed yourself with enough cranberry sauce and sweet potatoes to expand your waistline, get ready to wake up early the next day for Harvard Square's Black Friday sales.
Black Friday:

Pilgrims, turkey, and pumpkin pie—think you know a thing or two about Thanksgiving? Think again. This year, Flyby dug up a few little-known facts about the upcoming holiday to add a some spice to your dinner table chitchat.
#1: Turkeys by the Numbers
Last year, the U.S. raised a whopping 244 million turkeys, according to the National Turkey Foundation. Of those birds, approximately 46 million found themselves roasting in ovens across the country last Thanksgiving. For those of you keeping track, that means that almost 20% of the turkeys eaten in America are gobbled up on Thanksgiving.
#2: Turkey Wasn't the Main Dish at the First Thanksgiving
At least that's what the journals of Plimoth Plantation's Edward Winslow seem to imply. His account of the first Thanksgiving states that the Pilgrims and Wampanoag Indians feasted on venison, which was supplemented by Indian corn and some type of fowl. Some Thanksgiving staples noticeably absent from the original feast include potatoes, cranberries, and pumpkin pie.
#3: The First Thanksgiving Was Celebrated in Texas.
It's usually thought that Pilgrims' purported the "first" Thanksgiving in 1621, but information has surfaced suggesting that the original Thanksgiving feast took place prior to the Plymouth celebration. According to National Geographic, colonists in Florida, Maine, and Virginia all gathered for feasts of Thanksgiving prior to 1621, and going even further back, Spanish explorer Francisco Vásquez Coronado appears to take the prize for the very first Thanksgiving, having celebrated the feast with his men in Texas in 1541.
#4: Thanksgiving and the Presidents
With Thanksgiving celebrations dating back to the sixteenth century, American presidents have recognized the importance of the annual festivities right from the start. In 1789, George Washington officially recognized November 26 as a day of thanks, and Abraham Lincoln declared Thanksgiving a national holiday in 1863. But it was Franklin D. Roosevelt who, in 1939, tried to move Thanksgiving up to the third Thursday in November (an attempt to extend the period for Christmas shopping) before signing a law that sets Thanksgiving as the fourth Thursday in November.
#5: The National Thanksgiving Turkey is One Lucky Duck
Roosevelt's successor, Harry Truman, left his own mark on the holiday by pardoning the first National Thanksgiving turkey. Every year since 1947, the president has ceremoniously pardoned a single lucky turkey presented by the Natioal Turkey Foundation. Not only does the pardoned fowl get to meet the prez and avoid several slow and unpleasant hours in Grandma's oven, but the lucky turkey also gets to spend the remainder of its feathered days at Mount Vernon.
