After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The medical license of a longtime Boston-area doctor and Harvard alumnus was suspended Friday for “inappropriate and substandard examinations” conducted on student members of the Harvard Glee Club.
Bernard E. Kreger ’59 — an internal medicine practitioner at Boston Medical Center — was a member of the Harvard Glee Club during his undergraduate years.
In a Friday press release, the Massachusetts Board of Medicine announced the disciplinary action taken against Kreger’s license after “finding he poses a serious threat to the public health, safety and welfare.”
“The Board alleges that over the course of many years, Dr. Kreger conducted inappropriate and substandard examinations of student members of the Harvard Glee Club,” the press release read.
Evidence of misconduct that formed the basis of the board’s decision to suspend Kreger’s license stemmed from allegations concerning Kreger’s conduct in the 1980s and 1990s, when he served as a volunteer physician with the Harvard Glee Club. In 2018, former students came forward with complaints, leading to the board’s investigation.
The Harvard Glee Club — a choral society comprised of approximately 60 undergraduate and graduate men — declined to provide any official comment on the suspension of Kreger’s license. Glee Club manager Rowen S. Vonplagenhoef ’21 said current members of the Glee Club are surprised to hear of this development.
“This happened before our time, so we have no first-hand knowledge on the situation before the release of the article today,” Vonplagenhoef said. “This wasn’t on our radar since he belongs to the alumni.”
Kreger — who until Friday afternoon was listed on the Harvard Glee Club Alumni Foundation’s website as a member of the board of directors — has been removed from the Foundation’s website. The Harvard Glee Club Alumni Foundation did not respond to a request for comment.
In a blog post attributed to the Harvard Glee Club from the summer of 2008, Kreger was described as having ended his role as the group’s “tour physician,” although the reason for which was not made clear.
“Until a few short years ago, Bernie would personally conduct a physical on each member of the Glee Club to assess the status of any existing health conditions prior to the group’s departure,” the blog post reads. “That practice no longer exists.”
Kreger first received his medical license in the state of Massachusetts in 1967. Until his license suspension, Kreger practiced medicine at Boston Medical Center. By Friday evening, Kreger was no longer listed as a practitioner on Boston Medical Center’s website.
“At Boston Medical Center, we take any allegation of inappropriate conduct very seriously,” a BMC spokesperson wrote in an emailed press release. “Based on the decision of the Board of Registration in Medicine, Kreger is no longer seeing patients at Boston Medical Center.”
The Board’s press release noted Kreger can seek a hearing at the Division of Administrative Law Appeals within the next seven days. Kreger did not respond to a request for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 120 Harvard faculty signed a letter sent to University President Lawrence S. Bacow Thursday questioning the Harvard Corporation’s decision to cut this year’s endowment payout.
The Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — announced plans June 3 to reduce the endowment payout by 2 percent for Fiscal Year 2021 and draw a special assessment of restricted assets. The move came as Harvard projects a $750 million revenue shortfall from the coronavirus pandemic.
The faculty wrote that they were “told little” about the Corporation’s decision, which will result in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences receiving about $48 million less than it expected from its endowment distribution.
“This action is hard to understand,” the faculty wrote. “If there was ever a time in Harvard’s nearly 400 year history for emergency relief from the Corporation, this unprecedented global crisis would seem to be one.”
The faculty asked Bacow to provide “convincing reasons why this action is thought advisable at all now” — and a guarantee that the burden it poses would be shared equally during a time of record unemployment.
“We should be given some continuing assurance, backed up by evidence, that the hardships to come will be shared equitably across Harvard, and that the most vulnerable and least costly people at Harvard are not being sacrificed first and disproportionately,” their letter reads.
FAS Dean Claudine Gay wrote in a June 3 email that FAS would furlough some “fully or partially idled workers” due to the financial challenges of the pandemic. Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp announced Tuesday, however, that Harvard will not pursue layoffs or furloughs “at this time.”
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment Friday beyond confirming that Bacow had received the letter.
Philosophy professors Richard Moran and Susanna C. Siegel wrote the faculty letter, which had garnered 129 signatures as of Saturday afternoon.
According to Moran, neither he nor Siegel are experts in Harvard’s finances, but they are asking for “greater transparency” and assurances for employees at risk of losing their jobs.
“No one is assuming that even a 40 billion dollar endowment is simply a pot of money that can make our problems go away,” Moran wrote in an email. “We are asking for greater transparency about this particular decision to reduce payout to the FAS in what is already an emergency situation, and we want there to be transparency throughout the difficult years to come.”
The faculty also sent the letter to Gay and Arts and Humanities Dean Robin E. Kelsey, according to Moran. They noted in the letter, however, that the “upper administration of FAS have had this decision simply imposed on them.”
“It is now up to them and the rest of us to work out how to respond to it,” they wrote.
In a standard year, the University draws around 5 percent of its endowment funds to cover roughly a third of its operating expenses.
Vice President for Finance and Chief Financial Officer Thomas J. Hollister told the Harvard Gazette, a University-run publication, that despite the reduction, the payout is likely to be the “largest in many years,” depending on how the stock market behaves, as a percentage of the endowment’s market value.
The Corporation’s decision comes in the wake of what administrators have called a “substantial” decline in the value of the endowment, previously valued at $40.9 billion.
In the next fiscal year, FAS’s net funding from the endowment — which constitutes nearly half the FAS’s budget — will be down by 6 percent, per Gay’s early June email.
Gay wrote that the restricted funds special assessment is welcome, “but not scaled to the challenge we face in responding to the pandemic.” FAS will use the roughly $23 million it receives from the special assessment to finance “some essential elements” of its pandemic response — including masks and personal protective equipment and emergency funds for graduate students.
The faculty wrote that transparency will be essential to Harvard’s ongoing response to the financial challenges posed by the pandemic.
“Without such answerability from the Corporation and the Administration, throughout this
period of austerity, calls for all of us to pull together in a time of crisis will ring hollow,” the faculty wrote. “If our response to the crisis is to truly be a collective effort, such justifications and assurances seem the minimum that is owed to us all.”
Correction: June 17, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that given the 2 percent reduction, Harvard's endowment payout is likely to total roughly 3 percent for FY21. In fact, the two percent reduction is to the dollar value of the payout, not the total percentage.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Office for the Arts organized an exhibition called “Windows of Harvard,” installing visual artwork by 72 Harvard affiliates across campus and online.
The exhibition — which will remain open through the end of June — features paintings, photography, and other artwork that has been enlarged, printed, and hung on the windows of buildings around campus, from the Smith Campus Center to University Hall.
OFA staff member Marin J. Orlsoky Randow ’07-’08, one of the organizers of the exhibition, said the idea for “Windows of Harvard” was born from a chance conversation between herself and Brianne L. Sullivan, an administrative assistant at Harvard Common Spaces.
“I was taking a walk through Harvard Square and through campus, and I ran into Brianne,” Orlosky Randow said. “Brianne had been involved with a lot of the student move-out and remarked on how empty the buildings felt, and was wondering if there was some way that we could kind of enliven them and keep the sense of community that we all feel represented in some way in the buildings.”
When it came time to set up the physical installation, Sullivan “did all of the printing and installations herself” due to safety concerns in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, according to Orlosky Randow.
“What was decided for safety reasons was that since she was already designated an essential employee with authorization to enter buildings, and not wanting to put anyone else at risk, that she would be the only person allowed to do the installation, which was a huge undertaking,” Orlosky Randow said. “I'm really astounded by her dedication in taking it on."
Justin Zhu ’21, whose series of five photographs representing the classical elements is featured in the exhibition, said he was “very happy” to have his work displayed for the first time in a campus-wide project.
“This was my first time really displaying my work to the entire school, and I guess the whole world since anyone can see the artwork at the URL,” Zhu said. “I did participate in a few art exhibitions before in Pforzheimer House, but those were smaller scale arts and crafts projects confined to the house as opposed to the entire university.”
Sullivan said one of her goals when organizing this project was to ensure a variety of audiences — including both local Cambridge residents and Harvard affiliates living across the world — could partake in the exhibition.
“I grew up locally, and I remember growing up right down the street but never feeling welcome at Harvard or connected,” Sullivan said. “If I had known while growing up the kinds of resources that had been available to the public at Harvard, I think that I would have taken advantage of them.”
In addition to its ability to reach a variety of audiences, Sullivan also said she appreciated the diverse set of featured artists, saying that they do not all “claim artist as their first title.”
“I think a lot of people do art but they don't identify as an artist, and so when they see a call for art, they hesitate to submit,” Sullivan said. “A few of the pieces that are displayed outside Smith Campus Center actually are by security staff who work within the building.”
Uzo L. Ngwu ’23, whose digital art is featured in the exhibition said she was excited for the opportunity to “put myself out there as a new artist.”
“Honestly, artists are anyone who creates anything with meaning,” Ngwu said. “This exhibition allowed me to see the work of so many Harvard artists and connect with more creatives in the Harvard visual arts scene.”
