WASHINGTON D.C. — The dome of the United States Capitol building stands 288 feet tall, perched atop Capitol Hill and overlooking all but three buildings in the capital city. All the way across from it on the National Mall stands the tallest building in the area, the Washington Monument, jetting an astounding 555 feet above the earth. Together, these buildings stand as two of the most visible symbols of this country’s seat of democratic governance.
These structures are not divorced from the history that created them — construction on both these buildings began when slavery was still legal in the District. Though there exists some doubt as to whether enslaved persons contributed to the completion of the monument, there is no doubt that slave labor helped quarry the Capitol’s sandstone. Yet even when acknowledging these troubled origins, I still found myself standing speechless at their bases, admiring the way their luster reflects the mid-Atlantic sun.
These structures and monuments are impressive, enduring, and timeless, designed and set as allusions to the very country they represent. But more than symbols, they also serve an important purpose: They remind you how insignificant you are.
I don’t mean that in a bad way.
The work that goes on in Washington is critical. The decisions made in this city impact how trillions of dollars are spent, directly impacting more than 325 million people across the country and indirectly impacting the entire world. Undeniably, the work of this city matters; its agents, however, matter less.
Though some of our actions and words might outlast our time here by a few years, they, too, will one day be overcome by greater feats and newer issues. The buildings help remind us of this.
I’m not the only one who feels that way. In almost every conversation or event with a staffer or even with elected members of Congress, they mention how that sense of amazement and almost childlike awe still overcomes them as they walk through these streets and these halls.
One senator’s chief of staff — a position with almost as much influence as the senator he works for — explained to me that even after more than a decade working there, he still has moments where he stops and realizes how incredibly lucky he is.
By no means is humility a common feature in Washington — in fact, if anything it’s quite the opposite. But the humility that our national monuments convey is important. At least for me, they impart a sense of purpose and of greater obligation.
I hope that others share this sentiment, but if my conversations so far have been any indication, I’m confident that though we might have different experiences, explanations, and aspirations, our monuments humble us all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Zambrero Mexican Restaurant dipped out of Harvard Square on Friday, permanently closing the doors to its 71 Mount Auburn St. location.
After fewer than 18 months in business, the Australian burrito chain succumbed to a recent spate of closings, which also claimed its competitors Qdoba in June and Chipotle in January.
The first to fall in this wave of Mexican chain closings was Boloco, which left Harvard Square in July 2017 after more than two decades in business. Zambrero opened shop in Boloco’s vacated spot in March 2018, but had no more luck than its predecessor.
Zambrero is still the largest Mexican franchise chain in Australia; humanitarian Sam Prince started the restaurant chain in 2005 with the tagline, “Mexican with a mission.” For every burrito or bowl purchased, the restaurant donates a meal to those in need.
Zambrero did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Denise A. Jillson, the head of the Harvard Square Business Association, said that she applauded Zambrero's “charitable” mission.
“One would have thought that that would have been a big draw for the students in particular, because I do think that age group is very inclined to want to support humanitarian efforts,” she said. “For whatever reason that I cannot explain, Zambrero never took off the way they were anticipating that it would.”
Jillson added that they faced stiff competition from “locally-owned” Mexican restaurants like Felipe’s and El Jefé’s. El Jefés has also contributed to charitable causes, notably hosting a fundraiser for Ben M. Abercrombie ’21, who was paralyzed in 2017 football accident.
Luke R-I. Heine ’22 said that he was “sad,” but not surprised, to see Zambrero go.
“It's really hard to have that genre food in the Square, especially when you’re competing with Felipe’s — just a classic in the area,” he said.
Katelyn Yu-Mi Kim ’20 said that Zambrero was so often vacant that it had a vestige of privacy.
In April, she posted on the “Overheard at Harvard” Facebook page about Zambrero’s secluded reputation. The post — which read, “‘Where do you go to be alone?’ ‘Zambrero’” — garnered more than 300 likes.
“This is also tongue-in-cheek, but I think it really captured the spirit of what I was hearing from my friends and classmates,” she said.
Serena S. Shah ’21, who was a biweekly patron of the restaurant, said she was a proponent of Zambrero, despite its unpopularity among her peers.
“I actually ended up getting a couple of my blockmates to cross over and recognize that the food and the staff are nice,” she said. “It was just a good environment.”
Harvard Student Agencies owns the property that Zambrero will soon vacate, though HSA president James N. Swingos ’20 did not respond to a request for comment about what lies in store for the space.
“Something new and interesting will come for sure,” Jillson said.
