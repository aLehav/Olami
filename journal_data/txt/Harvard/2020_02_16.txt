After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Gcina Mhlophe is a South African actress, playwright, poet, director and activist. For over 20 years, Mhlophe has graced screens and stages around the world telling stories that celebrate culture and language. Mhlophe is a writer in residence at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, where she also performs and volunteers for organizations in the Boston area. Following the January run of her show, “Braveheart,” The Harvard Crimson sat down with Mhlophe to discuss her artistic journey.
This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.
The Harvard Crimson: As a storyteller, poet, playwright, director, and author, what allows you to cross boundaries between so many domains?
Gcina Mhlophe: When I started I just wrote poetry, and then I did a bit of short story writing. I think the performance poetry side of things opened my work to a wider audience. Even people who did not work out what language I am speaking, they were looking at the performance itself. And then I wrote in English as well, and people got to know my poetry and it got published in a few anthologies and magazines. It is the performance poetry, in fact, that opened the window for me into the stage. Working with the market theater of Johannesburg meant that I got to share my skills, my message, and my writings with a wider audience. Traveling to different countries has been unbelievable because of the theater world, even though it was difficult during the Apartheid years because sometimes we were not allowed or granted a passport, or when you got back home you had to answer to the police. But we were very clear we were cultural ambassadors traveling in these countries. And if you were denied it was okay, you continued doing your work.
THC: In your work, you often emphasize the power of the human voice. How do you feel that language aids you in your mission to preserve South African culture, or any culture for that matter?
GM: Stories are very powerful and very universal, number one. Number two is that the language in which you speak, if it’s the language of people where you are operating, is a stronger way of connecting with the people. One of the most asked questions about why I tell stories — the answer is always the same. I tell stories to wake up stories in other people, because I know every living being has a story to tell. Everybody's got a story. So if I can wake up stories in other people I will always say “mission accomplished.” So whether you are doing it in English or Zulu or Xhosa, it doesn’t matter which language you are speaking. If you connect with your audience and you are waking up stories within them, then you have done your job.
THC: To continue writing books, telling stories — where does it all come from? Where do you draw your inspiration from?
GM: For me it comes from things that I wish to experience. It comes from me being grateful for the privilege of having traveled as much as I have traveled, and sharing. The operative word in the work is sharing. So, if I can continue sharing what my parents and grandparents and my people gave me, I learn from other people again. When I go to different storytelling festivals, I experience so much. I listen to storytellers from different countries, and I think “wow! I never heard it like that.” With all this crosspollination from moving from this culture to that culture, if you listen to a storyteller from Turkey, a storyteller from Iran, from Chile, from Canada — it’s amazing, it’s always growing. I inspire, and I get reinspired.
THC: As a South African woman and a writer, do you feel that more South African women have a voice in today’s world?
GM: More South African women have definitely got a voice, and women are demonstrating their power in different ways. Another thing that pleases me is that at my age, I watch the younger generation, and I see the way that they are interacting, the way they are expressing themselves, and I love it. It really makes me feel good when I see young people looking at life in a way that I can’t look at because I am of a different generation. That’s been something special. It happens all over the world, by the way. There’s always new voices and new ways of looking at things, and that is also happening in South Africa or in southern Africa, for that matter.
THC: Have you thought about how the digital age brings new ways to express these stories?
GM: Oh, definitely. I’ve recorded CDs with my stories, and also I’ve written scripts where a story has been published in animation. I’ve done different things helping people in illustrating exhibiting, and interpreting the stories I have told. So there are many possibilities. Recently, a young composer adapted a poem that I wrote into an opera song, and the poem is performed with this beautiful opera singer. I was so honored, so humbled. It just never stops changing. I am looking to do more in the digital space, maybe opening a YouTube channel — because there is a lot to share with others.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Returning home to Lavietes after a tough five-game road stretch, Harvard (15-7, 4-3 Ivy) cruised to an 85-63 victory against Cornell (5-15, 2-5 Ivy), for its first double-digit conference win in over a year.
For the Crimson, it seemed like every Ivy league matchup for would go down the wire. All six of Harvard’s previous conference games have been decided by five points or less, with four of them coming down to the final possession. Against the Big Red, the Crimson was finally able to maintain its stellar play for a full forty minutes, never once giving Cornell a chance to get back into the game.
“I feel like throughout the season so far we would have a good lead and kind of let it go late or we would come back from a big lead and come up either winning or losing at the very end,” sophomore forward Noah Kirkwood said. “So I think just establishing a lead early and maintaining that throughout the whole game for 40 minutes I thought was the statement we made at home.”
Harvard’s consistent play for the entire game came largely in part to its contributions from the bench. First-year forward Chris Ledlum had an outstanding game, putting up a double-double with 15 points and 10 rebounds. Senior forward Danilo Djuricic was also critical for the Crimson offense with 13 points and a team-leading three three-pointers.
“I was very pleased with the efforts of the guys coming off the bench,” coach Tommy Amaker said. “Ledlum was just tremendous on the backboard plays with great aggressiveness. Danilo makes it a lot different for our team when he's on the floor and steps out there makes you know, one or two threes, and it just changes things for our ballclub.”
The tremendous bench play allowed for Harvard to have a balanced scoring attack and not overwork any one player. Other than senior guard Christian Juzang, no one on the team played for more than 25 minutes, allowing for there to be fresh legs on the court for the entirety of the game.
“We can utilize our depth in that way,” Amaker said. “And in our league, we know how important that is, you know, with back to back games and so, to have guys being mature and playing the right way. We got to get out to a big league and didn't get sloppy and careless and we were able to play multiple bodies.“
The team also saw resurgent performances from some of the key members of its rotation such as senior forward Chris Lewis. A tough road trip last weekend saw Lewis average 4.5 points on 40 percent shooting. Coming back home, the Alpharetta, Ga. native scored 13 points and was perfect from the field and free-throw line. Lewis’ inside scoring presence not only led to points in the paint but also opened up opportunities for the team from the perimeter.
“I think our guys love playing with Chris because he's, he's our focal point on the interior,” coach Amaker said. “We played through him, but they all know that if he doesn't have it, he's looking for them for their open threes. And so I thought he was giving us the balance of what we need in the interior.”
The Crimson’s blowout victory was also a result of its lockdown defense throughout the game. In the first half, Harvard limited the Big Red to 15 points on 15 percent shooting. After holding Cornell scoreless for the first seven minutes of the game, the Crimson never looked back as its defense held the Big Red to only four field goals in the period.
“I was really pleased with the start we had and how we were able to play defensively with great discipline,” Amaker said. “That was the key against this team and its style we’ll have to do it again tomorrow night.”
One of the lone bright spots for Cornell was the play of junior forward Jimmy Boeheim. Boeheim led the way for the Big Red with 17 points and scored 12 of the team’s 15 points in the first half.
“I give him credit, you know he's a really good player and his growth over the past few years at Cornell has been huge,” senior forward Justin Bassey said. “He's great and you know a versatile player who’s difficult to guard.”
The team looks to continue its excellent play at home Saturday night when they take on Columbia at 7 pm at Lavietes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard fencing placed extremely well against stiff competition this past weekend at the Ivy League Championships. The No. 2 men’s team (20-3, 5-0 Ivy League) became the first Crimson team to win the Ivy League Championship Title outright since their triumph back in 2013. The No. 7 women’s team (16-11, 3-3) finished fourth.
On the men’s side, the team had a clean sweep of the competition, going 5-0. The men’s squad also had a clean sweep in individual championships at foil and sabre weapons. Captain Geoffrey Tourette finished first in foil, followed by first-year Kenji Bravo, and captain Duncan Rheingans-Yoo took third. First-years Mitchell Saron and Filip Dolegiewicz finished first and second respectively in sabre, while senior Erwin Cai came in third.
The highlight of the event for the men was a close 15-12 victory over No. 1 Columbia. Senior sabre Erwin Cai was down 2-0 in his match against Columbia first-year Christopher Walker before coming back two touches to tie the bout. His opponent secured another touch, but Cai was able to storm back and secure a 5-3 victory for Harvard. First-year sabre Mitchell Saron also was able to win a nailbiter against his Columbia opponent by a score of 5-4.
“Columbia was our first opponent, and we knew it was going to be a tough bout,” said Dolegiewicz. “We had to bring the intensity up to 100%. After we beat them, we were excited and knew we had a really good shot at winning the whole title.”
Dolegiewicz went on to clinch the outright Ivy League Championship title after defeating his Princeton opponent.
“It was a very special moment, especially to be able to do it in front of friends and family. You work so hard for moments like that, and when it actually happens, the feeling is so surreal,” said Dolegiewicz. “Having all of my teammates rush me afterwards was extremely special and something I will never forget.”
For the women, sophomore Veronica Czyzewski notched a second place finish in sabre, first-year Karina Wang finished third in foil, and junior Saanchi Kukadia took third in epee. The three all claimed first-team All Ivy-League honors.
All of the bouts were five touch bouts, as opposed to the more conventional longer 15 touch bouts. The fencers had to be extremely focused; one subtle movement could be enough to decide these condensed bouts.
“I came in super nervous, but gave it my all in every bout,” said Wang. “To be honest, in these five touch bouts, you have to want it a lot more than your opponent because of the limited number of touches. Even when I was down, I told myself I can still beat my opponent.”
The women’s team defeated Cornell, Brown, and Yale, while falling to Princeton, Columbia, and Penn, the former two of which rank No. 1 and No. 2 in the nation. Though the women have not yet had as much success as they did last year, when they lost just six regular season matches before placing fourth at the NCAA Championships, the past week was an important response to a tough St. John’s Invitational, in which they lost all five bouts.
The Crimson continued to build momentum following a strong performance at Ivy League Championships with two Beanpot titles last Wednesday.
The men’s team extended its win streak to 10 after dominating its competition at the Beanpot, hosted by Boston College. They were able to win 25-2 over Brandeis, 23-4 over MIT, and 20-7 over Boston College. Five fencers went undefeated in all three matches. This is the men’s squad’s 12th straight Beanpot title.
Rheingans-Yoo and Tourette handily defeated their opponents combining to go 6-0. Tourette’s exceptional performance continued his remarkable undefeated season.
The epee squad made up of sophomore Josh Wilcox, sophomore Andrew Lee, and first-year Jonas Hansen went a perfect 9-0 against their Brandeis opponents. The foil squad also was able to go a perfect 9-0 against their Boston College opponents.
The women’s team was also able to go a perfect 3-0 to claim its 13th straight Beanpot Title. They were able to win 19-8 over Brandeis, 22-5 over MIT, and 16-11 over Boston College. Four fencers posted 8-1 records, including first-year sabre Maria Theodore, Wang, sophomore foil Cynthia Liu, and junior epee Cindy Gao.
The women’s epee squad was also able to secure a 9-0 record against their Brandeis opponents, while their foil squad went undefeated against MIT.
“We tried to feed off all the good things we did at Ivies at Beanpot,” said Wang. “We’ve been training really hard since J-term and it really showed with this win at Beanpot.”
Harvard will look to build on its recent wins at the NCAA regionals next month on March 8th. A strong performance there would send them to the NCAA Championships, which will be held on March 19-22 in Detroit, Mich.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was the second overtime, and Noah Kirkwood looked tired. The sophomore guard had just missed a three point shot badly, making him 1-for-9 from beyond the arc. But when Harvard needed points most, it turned to Kirkwood and he delivered, as he so often has in the absence of Bryce Aiken. First, with the Crimson down three points, he drained a difficult, stepback long two from the top of the key. Then, with the game knotted at 69 with just over a minute to play, the Ottawa native, again isolated at the top of the key, drilled a triple to give Harvard a lead it would not relinquish. When a Mike Smith would-be game-tying triple came up short, Kirkwood was fouled and walked to the line having missed four of his first six free throw attempts. But that did not matter, either. He cooly knocked down both free throws and — finally — put the game away, allowing the Crimson to sneak past Columbia 77-73 at Lavietes Pavilion on Saturday.
“Over the course of the season so far without [Aiken], a big clutch player on our team, coach has really allowed me to have that spot now and given me the confidence, and more importantly my team has given me that confidence,” said Kirkwood. “Even though my shot wasn’t falling, every time down guys were saying ‘keep shooting, keeping shooting, it will fall,’ and that’s really what got me going.”
The game felt very familiar.
“Unbelievable,” head coach Tommy Amaker said. “I don’t know what it is about us with Columbia but it certainly has been par for the course for a number of years now in terms of how tight and overtimes and amazing games that both teams have played.”
A year ago, it was Aiken who prevented what would have been a crushing loss at home against the Lions with an improbable off-balance, double-clutch three pointer that sent the game to double overtime. Harvard eventually won in triple overtime on the back of Aiken’s career-high 44 points, overcoming an inspired road effort by a team with one win in league play.
Saturday night, the Crimson (16-7, 5-3 Ivy) again entered a home matchup against one-win Columbia (6-18, 1-7) as a substantial favorite. But as was the case in both meetings last year — the game in Morningside Heights also went to overtime — this was the furthest thing from a walk in the park for Harvard. With Aiken out indefinitely with a sprained foot, Columbia’s Smith was the diminutive point guard who put on a show, nearly willing the Lions to victory.
First, with Columbia down by two points at the end of regulation and the shot clock unplugged, Smith weaved his way through the Crimson’s defense and made a layup to knot the game at 53, completing a 6-0 Lions run in the game’s last three minutes. Harvard, which had led for most of regulation, then had two chances to win the game without overtime. A loose ball following a missed three by senior point guard Christian Juzang caromed off of Columbia with 1.4 seconds to play, but the Crimson was unable to get a shot off after the inbound, as Juzang’s effort to create space for a game-winning three resulted in a travel.
Overtime meant more of the Mike Smith show. To an even greater degree than in regulation, when Smith scored 19 of Columbia’s 32 first half points before cooling off in the second stanza, the Lions became a one-man team. And it came ever so close to working. Smith poured in 15 more points on 11 shots across the two overtimes and finished with a nearly Aikenian 38 on 17-of-37 shooting.
“We certainly could not guard him,” said Amaker. “He’s fast, quick, and shifty, and so creative with the ball. He doesn’t get tired and he just has a great deal of confidence and he’s so creative and crafty, with shot fakes and step-throughs. You try not to foul him, so it takes a lot of effort and discipline to try to defend that kid.”
Smith’s NBA-range three pointer — which he took without hesitation with Juzang right in his face — put Columbia up by two with 24 seconds to go in overtime, and after a missed Juzang three it appeared that Smith’s heroics were going to be enough to secure a monumental upset.
But nobody informed senior forward Justin Bassey of that likelihood. As he has done so often throughout his Harvard career, including with a vital rebound in last season’s triple overtime win, Bassey made the big hustle play when it counted. He snatched the offensive rebound from Juzang’s miss and converted the putback to send the game to a second overtime — and the sixth overtime in the last three games between these two teams.
Smith then had a good look to win the game at the buzzer, but his three rimmed out, setting the stage for the second overtime and for Kirkwood’s heroics.
Before the late-game fireworks, the packed student section did not have many opportunities to erupt in what was a low-scoring, sloppy affair, as Saturday nights in the Ivy League often produce. The main exceptions came on a number of tremendous blocks by the Crimson’s rim protectors. Senior forwards Chris Lewis and Robert Baker repelled three shots apiece, with Lewis stifling three attempts at the rim in a 10-minute span and Baker rejecting a pair of shots at the rim and a three point attempt by Columbia’s Jake Killingsworth, who was surprised by the amount of ground the spindly senior was able to quickly cover.
“They had a big time presence back there, which they should,” said Amaker. “We have always had that in our program. We’ve taken pride in the back line of our defense all the way through the years. These guys have adopted that and have been tremendous for us, so it’s an added weapon for us on the defensive end.”
Harvard’s winning streak at home — it remains undefeated at Lavietes Pavilion this season — had largely been spurred by strong shooting, but the Crimson’s touch from deep abandoned it on Saturday. Harvard connected on just eight of its 43 three point attempts, easily the team’s worst shooting performance in league play. Lewis made a number of timely baskets, including an and-one layup to tie the game at 69 in the second overtime. In addition to his three thunderous blocks, the Alpharetta, Ga., native finished with 16 points, joining Kirkwood (22) and Juzang (10) in double figures, and a team-high 11 rebounds and four steals.
“With our offense, a lot of the time we just have to realize that [Lewis] is our main guy, we go through him and we play inside-out, that’s our big calling card,” said Kirkwood. “On a lot of possessions we were settling for threes that we just weren’t making. So when that was going on we really went through [Lewis] a lot more and then the kickouts helped us a lot from him. He was a great player today.”
The Lions matched the Crimson’s futile shooting. Harvard shot 37% from the field and 19% from three; Columbia finished at 37% and 17%. Aside from Smith, only forward Ike Nweke, who was plagued by foul trouble for most of the first half and finished with 11 points, scored for the Lions in either overtime period.
The win paired with a Yale loss brings Harvard within a game of first in the Ivy League and keeps the Crimson in a three-team tie for third place with six games to play. Harvard will have the chance to avenge losses at Princeton and Penn next weekend as it looks to stay in the hunt for an Ivy League championship.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 18 Harvard men’s hockey team found a flair for late-game dramatics on Friday, as it cut down a three-goal deficit against rival Yale.
But the comeback fell short of victory in the end.
The Crimson (11-8-5, 9-4-4 ECAC) battled to a 4-4 stalemate with the Bulldogs (10-12-2, 7-8-2) Friday night at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center. The tie comes at a crucial moment for the Crimson, as the team is in the midst of a final ECAC stretch while striving to keep its national playoff hopes alive.
POWERPLAY SPARK
The Crimson got a boost Friday from its NCAA-best powe play (30.7%).
Harvard’s lone second-period goal came with the man advantage, and the Crimson notched its third tally of the game just after a Yale penalty expired in the third frame.
“It’s really important to just keep momentum in the game,” said Crimson first-year Nick Abruzzese, who had two goals and two assists Friday. “We’ve got the No. 1 power play in the nation right now, so it’s been a big strength of ours.”
The Crimson notched its lone powerplay strike of the game midway through the second period, when Abruzzese converted with Yale junior Brett Jewell in the box for holding. Just 20 seconds before that, though, Harvard coughed up its third shorthanded goal in the last two games.
“Tonight, [the shorthanded goal] was a bouncing puck coming off the glass and we just have to make a more conservative decision,” coach Donato said. “I don’t think we gave up the same kind of opportunities we did last game.”
Midway through the second stanza of the Beanpot consolation game on Monday, which the Crimson lost 7-2 to Boston College, Harvard gave up two man-down goals on the same powerplay, turning a two-goal game into a blowout. But Donato said he is not overly concerned about the shorthanded tallies.
“The Boston College game — there’s not enough time tonight for me to dissect all those issues,” he said. “We really haven’t given up a lot of shorthanded goals against for the season.”
Yale holds a penalty kill efficiency of 75.6 percent — the fifth-worst mark in the country.
The Crimson, on the other hand, is 27-for-88 on the powerplay this season — good for the top execution rate in college hockey. Harvard has scored man-up in 20 of its 25 games in 2019-2020.
GORNET IN GOAL
The Crimson opted to start senior Cameron Gornet in the crease on Friday over rookie Mitchell Gibson, who has received the nod in eight of Harvard’s last nine affairs.
Gornet (4 GA, .879 SV%) made 29 saves on Friday, including 13 in the first period as the Harvard offense struggled to set up anything in the Bulldogs’ zone.
Last year, Gornet earned the Tim Taylor Cup — a trophy given to the most valuable player in the Harvard-Yale matchup at the Bright — after recording 35 saves in his only career shutout on Feb. 23.
The fourth-year, who started in seven outings as a junior, holds a .907 save percentage and a 2.90 goals against average this season.
RIVALRY ON ICE
Friday’s draw came one month after the Crimson trounced Yale, 7-0, in front of over thousands of fans at Madison Square Garden. The Bulldogs came out with more fervor in the squads’ third bout of the season.
“We knew we were going to see a different team today,” Donato said. “This is a team that’s got a lot of pride, that competes really hard...has some real good players over there, and certainly was looking at tonight as an opportunity to empower their group by coming out and playing really competitive tonight. As much as we talked about it and tried to prepare for it, they were the most competitive team tonight.”
Harvard leads the Bulldogs, 148-92-23, in the all-time series. Yale, which bounced back after a 2-7 start to the 2019-20 campaign, currently sits in eighth place in the ECAC.
“On our end, we’d like to think that our compete level would be at a high playing against Yale at home,” coach Donato said.
