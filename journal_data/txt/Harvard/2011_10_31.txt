After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the Class of 2011, the gap between the percentage of workforce-bound students entering consulting and financial services narrowed to five points, according to the Office of Career Services’ senior survey. In 2010, that gap was 13 points, and, in 2009, it was eleven. It seems fair to say that while the popularity of Wall Street as a post-graduation plan has diminished in recent years, the popularity of consulting has not.
Why has this career option become so popular for Harvard students? Unlike much older professions such as medicine, law, or business (in the sense of entrepreneurship), management consulting has only come into vogue in the past quarter century. Many students have never even heard of the industry when they first come to Harvard, and many show up to senior year recruiting events just as confused. Even still, students of all concentrations, from Classics to Molecular and Cellular Biology, apply for the opportunity to examine the workings of corporations and improve their profitability.
In short, consulting companies have a highly structured, accessible recruiting process and promise to bring order to students’ amorphous post-graduation goals and desires.
As early as sophomore year, consulting firms often send personalized emails to Harvard students, explaining why they are a good fit for the firm and why the firm is a good fit for them. Once on campus, firms hold highly publicized information sessions at central Cambridge locations. During these events, students are given ample opportunity to connect with recent Harvard alumni who work at each company, who describe their transition from undergraduate to analyst as a smooth and successful one. In order to apply, all one has to do is submit a resume and (sometimes) a cover letter online. Unlike at other schools, where students have to travel to a company office for interviews, many consulting firms hold first-round interviews at a designated facility five-minutes from Harvard Yard.
The assertive marketing and comparative ease of the recruitment process highlight the positive aspects of this job and obscure some of the negative ones. Compared to all but financial services, consulting is a lucrative field, offering starting salaries of $60,000-plus. Consulting firms invest a great deal in employee training and feedback, in a systematic way. However, the daily reality of a consultant’s work can be grueling and repetitive; it is a different type of hard work than Harvard students are used to. Additionally, working at a top firm does not necessarily help a young person narrow down their career plans; indeed, the high turnover rate of the lower ranks of big consulting firms means that many young professionals do not leave by choice.
Additionally, consulting firms repeatedly emphasize that they are a career choice that opens doorways rather than closes them. Whether the claim is true that more than just a few token employees leave consulting to go into specific industries, start a small business, or head a non-profit is uncertain. However, the firms that come to campus definitely position themselves as ladders to corporate promotion, allowing students to bypass years of unglorified introductory work at the lower levels of their dream industries.
Is this a bad thing? On the one hand, forays into management consulting yield a lot of money and professional success of some type for individual students. On the other hand, there is a case to be made that society would be better off if 12 percent of the Class of 2011, the 12 percent that is arguably best at making connections and problem-solving used their existing skills to start restaurants, worked in education reform, or write books, as a recent article in The Yale Daily News argued.
But in a more constructive light, rather than bemoaning the number of students going into consulting, companies and recruiters in other fields should learn from their successful recruiting practices. Early, personalized attention and ample networking opportunities yield more interest than career openings weeks before graduation, resume drops followed by long silences, and unclear job descriptions or exit prospects. One organization that has followed this advice is Teach for America, whose recruitment practices include targeted emails, one-on-one coffee chats, and a clear explanation of exit options (including partnerships with Harvard Business School, Bain & Company, and Goldman Sachs). The best argument for the effectiveness of management consulting companies may be the degree to which they have perfected the recruiting process, and, should they want to attract Harvard graduates, employers in other fields would do well to follow suit.

The development of unconventional fossil fuel resources like oil sands and shale gas in the past couple of decades puts the renewable energy industry in an unexpected bind. New drilling and exploration technologies have increased the viability of previously inaccessible resources such as those in the Arctic or the depths of the Gulf of  Mexico. Consequently, the oil and gas supply hasn’t tightened as quickly as was predicted, and progress towards the much-awaited spike in fossil fuel prices that has been touted for years as the tipping point for renewable energy production has been significantly undermined. Admittedly, energy prices are still high from the average consumer’s standpoint, but they are not nearly high enough for price parity with renewables. For example, the drop in natural gas prices due to recent shale gas exploitation may have pushed the point of price parity between renewables and natural gas back by several decades, if not longer. As a result, the renewable energy industry’s growth has been stunted by the belief that the ameliorative effects of this newfound fossil fuel wealth are sufficient justification for reduced investment in wind, solar, and other clean technologies.
Although big oil and the renewable energy industry have long been at odds, even the greener camp has been able to find a few reasons to applaud the recent success of oil and gas: The expansion of unconventional fossil fuel reserves has dramatically improved energy availability around the world. Unconventional fossil fuels have reduced our dependence on the Middle East for oil, and Canada, with its large oil sands resources, has replaced members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries as the largest exporter of oil to the United States. They have also eased geopolitical tensions as countries like India, Brazil, and China have discovered exploitable oil and gas reserves in their own backyards with the help of much improved exploration and drilling technologies. Furthermore, unconventional fossil fuels have kept energy prices low for millions of residents of developing countries, for whom expensive renewables like wind and solar don’t jive with the realities of their pocketbooks. Especially in times of global economic turmoil, governments that have found it hard to justify expensive investments in clean energy have benefitted from more rapid returns on investment in fossil fuels.
It is tough to fight realities like these, and renewable energy advocates are quickly finding that some of their most potent arguments against fossil fuels are losing steam. Oil isn’t as expensive as we thought it would be, reserves aren’t necessarily concentrated in the hands of OPEC, and global supplies of fossil fuels are probably going to last longer than soothsayers predicted. So where does that leave renewables? Are they destined to remain relegated to the sidelines in global energy portfolios?
We can give fossil fuels some credit for the improvements mentioned above, but they still don’t constitute a full-fledged solution to our energy problems. An independent study recently conducted by the Berkeley Earth Project has validated the much-maligned climate findings of the University of East Anglia (home of the “Climategate” scandal), thereby reaffirming the salient threat of global climate change. The recent oil and gas boom is only going to exacerbate this problem since it has led to a corresponding increase in global carbon emissions and a decrease in renewables activity and investment. Countries like Brazil and China, instead of turning to renewables to meet their growing energy needs, are eagerly exploiting new coal and oil reserves that have become accessible only in the past few years due to technological improvements. Petrobras, the state-controlled oil company of Brazil, last year raised $70 billion for the development of newly discovered deepwater oil reserves off Brazil’s coast, thereby locking in investment that might otherwise have gone towards renewables projects.
Additionally, let’s not forget that the “low prices” of fossil fuels aren’t really that low if we consider long-ignored social costs. Oil and gas that come from harder to reach deepwater wells and oil sands rely on increasingly energy-intensive processes with much higher carbon footprints. In fact, barrel for barrel, Canadian oil sands emit about 25 percent more greenhouse gases than Saudi oil because they are so much harder to extract. Carbon emissions aside, extracting oil from oil sands not only requires huge amounts of water, but also wreaks havoc on surface ecosystems as huge swathes of land have to be cleared during the process. Furthermore, I do not need to remind everyone of Deepwater Horizon to highlight the risks of unconventional fossil fuel resources. These risks only increase as companies race to harness unconventional fossil fuels from reserves that are getting harder and harder to access.
Unless we figure out how to price the externalities of burning fossil fuels, such as carbon emissions, environmental degradation, and public health impacts, renewables will remain at a disadvantage to fossil fuels for much longer than we can afford. This problem is compounded by the fact that Congress doesn’t seem to be in the mood to level the playing field for renewables. Federal tax credits, such as the production tax credit for wind, are due to expire at the end of 2012, and the recent budget debacles suggest that Congress is unlikely to reapprove such spending measures. However, due to the disproportionate political influence of some lobbies, the billions of dollars of annual subsidies to the oil and gas industry are likely to remain in place, even though oil and gas companies are making record profits.
Given such externalities and risks, we need to take a step back and reevaluate some of the progress fossil fuels are making. Are the short-term benefits of rapid oil and gas development worth the longterm tradeoffs associated with climate change and pollutant emissions?  As such, it’s in our best interest not to let the recent success of unconventional fossil fuels undermine continued investment in renewables. Only a balanced approach to energy development will provide a long-term solution to our energy woes.

Microfinance has been a buzzword in the non-profit world for the past decade. Organizations like Kiva.org and BRAC have prided themselves on the success of the people they work with in developing countries. What happens however, when a for-profit bank enters into the world of micro-finance? Are micro-loans sustainable, and do they allow potential for growth in addition to an opportunity for people to escape poverty? During his time in Bangalore, India while working for Ujjivan, a microfinance institution, and its sister non-profit, Parinaam Foundation, Paolo Singer ’13 found that there are many confounding factors and room for improvement in the world of microfinance.
Indian microfinance organizations frequently uses poverty line statistics to shape their work, and poverty lines are an important political tool in India. The state uses them to decide who gets important benefits, and microfinance banks can use them to show whether they are serving the poor. These lines, calculated based on how much it costs to eat 2,100 calories per day, are inconsistent: The World Bank estimates 41.6 percent are poor, the Asia Development Bank, 65.3 percent, and the Indian government, 23.6 percent. The national household survey shows 62 percent of people in India receive less than 2,100 calories per day. The trend of manipulating poverty statistics is hurting the end social impact of government policies and microfinance. Singer says that Ujjivan—or any microfinance organization—needs to look at poverty from the perspective of the needs of its customers, not poverty lines. To underscore the danger of spinning these statistics, he unfortunately acknowledges that no major microfinance institution ventures into India’s slums, the exact places where credit for water filters, latrines, and vocational training would be most valuable.
Through extensive surveying in low-income areas of Bangalore, Singer found that family loans were primarily used for rent and education, and other immediate costs such as marriage and home repairs. He found that loan recipients prefer to pay loans back at steady intervals throughout the year, to the point where it becomes an important social activity. The added discipline to re-pay every month creates an incentive for customers to spend more money on up-front expenses. With no access to savings, customers use loan repayments as a safe investment for excess change every month. This phenomenon, which Singer notes as “backward savings,” results in easy credit being used by the poor as a replacement for a savings account.
“Microfinance companies need to begin to offer complete financial services, particularly savings,” Singer states. “If savings are not offered and encouraged, microfinance fails to empower adults to escape the cycle of poverty. It is the role of the government to ensure that microfinance organizations do not only offer credit to their clients—it currently doesn’t allow companies without banking licenses to offer savings."
In addition to offering financial services, microfinance will never empower individuals past the level of sustainability and promote entrepreneurship if the industry doesn’t start giving out at least slightly larger loans. Singer recounts the story of a laundry business owner taking out a small loan. Currently, she washes clothes by hand at a public washing location. She would like to invest in a washing machine to save time, hire employees, and expand her business, but she cannot get a guarantor to qualify. Toward the end of his stay in Bangalore, Singer gave a presentation describing field research and data analysis on the failure of microfinance to help customers increase their income and recommendations for better services. The CEO and founder of Ujjivan, Samit Ghosh, was in the room. After a prolonged pause, he replied: "Even my own customers tell me that microfinance doesn't help them out of poverty." With that, he walked out of the room, leaving the surprised managers shell-shocked. "He's never said it so bluntly before. You've now heard it from ‘The Man’ himself,” one said.
As the start of a solution, Singer recommends that microfinance companies find a way to give larger loans to fund promising businesses. They should also give targeted loans to the ultra-poor slum dwellers—that is, the bottom 50 percent of urban income earners in India. While even the poorest clients have repayment rates of 99 percent, incredible stigmatization exists for those living in slums. Managers in India view slum-dwellers as untrustworthy and below the “level” of loan officers.  Singer uses Grameen Bank in Bangladesh as a better model of successful micro-loans. “They've developed a formidable array of loans, savings, and social services for the ultra-poor, and they show that even the poorest will pay back their loans when they are empowered to invest in their futures,” Singer says.
While microfinance can be a great start to helping people mitigate some effects of poverty, Singer’s research in Bangalore shows that perhaps banks that give out loans need to start thinking beyond poverty line statistics to find more innovative ways to increase social impact and provide more holistic financial services. By committing to better targeted products and services that enable the poor to invest in themselves and their families, microfinance institutions can bring renewed vigor to their original missions to alleviate poverty. Indians—and the world—are still waiting.

Very rarely in Israel’s history could its political actions be described as truly, absolutely, and blindly self-destructive. When one prisoner is exchanged for more than a thousand prisoners, of almost infinite greater political and economic value, any objective bystander with two brain cells and a synapse should recognize such a society. But even worse than prior Israeli blunders, somehow this exchange occurred under the watch, and even the broad support, of Israeli civil society.
One thousand and twenty seven. The number is almost so large that it loses its meaning, but it was the number of Palestinian prisoners exchanged for Gilad Shalit. Hamas selected 479 of the prisoners and Israel selected the remainder. Of Hamas’s 479, 315 were serving life sentences and most were serving sentences longer than 20 years. One can assume that the remainder selected by Israel committed lesser crimes and are not expected to threaten Israel.
Four hundred and seventy nine. Still, the number is too large to grasp its full scope. The mass majority of the 479 either planned or participated directly in attacks against Israel or indirectly through leadership in a violent organization. To be exact, 569 Israelis were killed by those being released and many more were injured. Of course, as is the case anywhere, dozens of the 479 were probably victims of circumstances beyond their control. The point remains that Israel released many hundreds who have intended and continue to intend the deaths of Israelis.
Even those who bemoan the likely loss of future lives—almost always within a justification for the prisoner exchange—still do not comprehend the full cost of the 1027. The operations of gathering intelligence, capturing, interrogating, and keeping in prison of a high-profile prisoner carry very high economic and political costs, not to mention the deaths and injuries of soldiers and intelligence operators. No doubt the repetition of these operations is already underway for many of the 479.
One. That is a number anybody can grasp and, more importantly, it is a number that anyone can humanize. In Israel, posters of Gilad Shalit decorated city streets, his picture hung from taxi mirrors, and his image stalked television programs. In a state with mandatory military service, every soldier is a symbol for a loved one. Gilad Shalit’s family impressively energized Israeli society to their cause. They protested outside Netanyahu’s house and when they made pilgrimage to Jerusalem, over 200,000 joined them. Of course, the hysteria of Israel’s civil society could not have served Hamas’s interests more if it was orchestrating the Gilad Shalit events itself.
Every state needs its symbols and every civil society needs its heroes. Gilad Shalit united a deeply diverse and politically fragmented state. However, the danger with symbols mirrors the danger of a civil society strong enough to bully political leadership—they are not rational. Seventy-nine percent of Israelis supported the prisoner exchange. Functioning democracy requires not only checks and balances between branches of the government, but also between civil society and political leadership. Netanyahu and his administration failed to protect Israel’s people and interests. Netanyahu is as responsible for this debacle as much as an irrational and emotional civil society.
Moreover, the precedent set by the prisoner exchange has created at least two moral hazards. First of all, now that the going rate between Israeli and Palestinian prisoners is established at 1000:1, Hamas and other anti-Israeli groups are incentivized to capture more Israeli soldiers or civilians. According to an AP report, thousands in Gaza chanted, “The people want a new Gilad Shalit” and some of Hamas’s leadership have already hinted at fresh plans. The second moral hazard is the risk that Israeli families of victims will exploit the gullibility of Israel’s civil society to rescue their loved ones to detriment of countless others.
Even worse than the shocking shortsightedness of Israeli civil society were domestic and international analysts’ gullible somersaults to dig their heads deeper in the ground with more desperate and contrived justifications for the exchange. Haaretz laughably lauded Israel’s “stubbornness and steadfastness,” saving their highest plaudits for Netanyahu for “know[ing] how to draw lines in the sand.” The typically conservative Jerusalem Post shrugged off the steep cost and moral hazards because “right now an IDF soldier’s life is being saved.”
Some, including Gilad Shalit, hope that the prisoner exchange will precipitate future talks, possibly with Egypt in a mediating role once again. Unless those future talks are also about prisoner exchanges, those talks are very difficult to imagine. Hamas and others who wish Israel to disappear have now had their violence rewarded and they will only view Israel as a weaker target, rather than as a future peace partner. The exchange may have set many precedents, but peace negotiations are not among them.
Israel does not make small decisions. It is one of the world’s few states whose existence is not accepted by many of its neighbors. Israel’s flourishing civil society is the foundation of its strength. It is also a potential Achilles Heel. Proponents of Israel should hope the country rediscovers its backbone and foresight.

Last week, the Harvard Political Review released its Annual Report of the United States of America (ARUSA), a collection of articles seeking to provide a transparent view of the state of the federal budget.
The report aims to explain the government’s finances to the public and also to propose and analyze potential solutions to the nation’s fiscal problems.
“My hope is that [ARUSA] will flesh out the very vague image that politicians give to the budget,” said Georgia V. Stasinopoulos ’13, who wrote two articles for this year’s report.
The 2011 Annual Report is split into four categories. The first is an “income statement” for America, which breaks down the government’s expenditures and revenues over the last year, showing the exact sources of the roughly $1.3 trillion budget deficit. Another group of articles takes an in-depth look at major government expenditures, including Social Security, defense, and welfare. A third section analyzes sources of revenue for the government—focusing on taxes and borrowing—while the report concludes with a series of special reports on fiscal issues that have gained prominence in the last year, such as the threat of a government shutdown this past August.
Research and writing for the project began in early June of this year. Writer Jonathan K. Yip ’12-’13 began preliminary research by consulting think tanks as well as existing literature on the budget wars. From there, the challenge was finding something new to add to the conversation, he said.
The research process was complicated by the partisanship that dominates much of the dialogue about the budget.
“There are facts and then there is also spin, political messaging,” said Yip.
For Yip and his fellow writers, ARUSA was an exercise in isolating the facts of fiscal policy. The report sought to be bipartisan, recognizing that both parties contributed to the rise of the nation’s economic problems.
“In a year where political affiliation causes rifts in friendships and partnerships, I wanted ARUSA to portray a breed of problem-solving that recognizes the value of putting different types of heads together,” wrote co-editor Rachel L. Wagley ’11 in an email.
ARUSA also sought to make the language of fiscal policy—often prone to either jargon or oversimplification—accessible to readers. The hope is that the report will engage citizens in thinking about the impact of fiscal issues in their own communities.
“That’s really my hope: that people will be able to transpose the federal story into a local story,” said Stasinopoulos.
The report was also edited by Noah S. Rayman ’12, a Crimson Associate Managing Editor.

Gravity was put to work with a Halloween twist in the third annual Pumpkin Drop on Friday afternoon, where student scientists dropped fruits and vegetables out of a high window to watch the explosive results.
A crowd of about 60 spectators gathered below the open window of Jefferson Labs 450 while students released pumpkins, squash, and apples onto a tarp on the pavement below from a height of 38 feet.
The falling items were pre-treated in a number of ways, including microwaving, freezing in a conventional freezer, and dipping in liquid nitrogen.
The event, jointly sponsored by the Harvard College Engineering Society and the Society of Physics Students, was coupled for the first time this year with an egg drop competition.
The competition challenged entrants to create a device which would prevent a raw egg from cracking when dropped out of the window.
The competition drew 13 entries made out of materials such as newspaper, tissue paper, and plastic bags.
Entries were weighed before the event, and the official rules dictated that the winning device would be the lightest entry which still succeeded in keeping the egg from cracking.
After the eggs were dropped, Jeff W. Iuliano ’13, who used plastic bags in his design to reduce the speed and power of the ground impact, was crowned the winner.
“[The competition] sounded like something fun that I would want to do on a Friday afternoon,” Iuliano said. “I ended up not having a problem set due for physics, so I had free time all of a sudden. So this morning I just got a bunch of stuff and put it in a bag. It succeeded, and it was light.”
Nearly all of the competitors entered the competition through their physics or engineering classes, said Samuel M. Meyer ’13, the event coordinator for SPS.
Ryan C. Hellar ’13, another student who participated in the egg drop, said he learned about the competition in his Engineering Sciences 125 class.
“Our final project is somewhat related to this, so our professor suggested we do it as good practice,” Hellar said.
This year’s event was the most well attended so far, according to Meyer.
“We had good turnout in the past, but I think it’s been steadily increasing year after year,” he said, adding that he was particularly impressed given that many students attendees were taking classes that had problem sets due on Fridays.
“I’m always happy to see that we’ve got a lot of people out here,” Meyer said.

A team of Harvard researchers has developed a new arterial visualization tool that may result in quicker and more accurate diagnoses of heart disease.
The interactive visualization tool, called HemoVis, takes data from patient-specific blood flow simulations and flattens out the arterial geometry into a 2-D tree diagram representation, which highlights at-risk areas in a single red-to-black color scheme. The method departs from traditional artery visualization tools, which require users to rotate complex 3-D models that use rainbow color mapping.
“Our goal was to develop the most accurate and efficient visualization of arteries for patient diagnosis,” said Michelle A. Borkin ’06, a Harvard doctoral candidate in applied physics and lead author of the project.
The research was mainly a collaboration among the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard Medical School, and Brigham & Women’s Hospital. Working with multiple physicians and researchers, the team compared the effectiveness of both techniques in identifying regions of low endothelial shear stress within arteries, an occurrence linked to the progression of disease in coronary arteries. By allowing researchers to simply observe 2-D cross sections rather than spinning around 3-D images, the HemoVis tool resulted in fewer mistakes in identification.
“Even experts missed a lot of the at-risk areas with the traditional 3-D models,” said Amanda E. Peters, team researcher and a Harvard doctoral candidate in applied physics.
Through multiple clinical simulations, the HemoVis tool was shown to significantly increase diagnostic accuracy from 39 percent to 91 percent.
The overall simulation project has spanned nearly five years. The first iteration of the tool actually emerged from Borkin’s final project in Computer Science 171: “Visualization”, taught by her current graduate advisor Professor Hanspeter Pfister.
Though the team did acknowledge the continued importance of 3-D color mapping tools in surgical planning, the findings met resistance within the medical visualization community in their repudiation of the long-held belief that color mapping techniques were superior.
“People were so set on how they were used to seeing the data,” Peters said. “It took a lot of effort to convince people to accept a different perspective.”
The tool gained wide acceptance during its presentation Saturday at the IEEE Information Visualization Week, one of the leading visualization conferences held this past weekend at Brown University.
The developers are now working to add new functionality to optimize its effectiveness.
“In our current and future work, we are continuing to improve the 2-D interface as well as link the 2-D visualization to its 3-D representation to assist in other clinical tasks such as surgical planning,” Borkin said.
The team’s findings will be published later in the year in the journal IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge Mayor David P. Maher, who is up for reelection this term, lives just around the corner from where he grew up.
Maher, who has resided in Cambridge all his life, has extensive experience in City politics; he has served four terms on the School Committee and six terms on City Council, and is currently the chair of both.
Maher says he is committed to completing and expanding upon the projects he has undertaken during his time in office, while tempering the ideological with the practical when it comes to politics.
“It’s about taking a pragmatic approach to local government and to being able to understand the environment that we’re in, the challenges we face, and trying to address all of that,” he says.
Maher says his father, who was a police officer, encouraged his commitment to public service.
“He instilled this sense of giving back to the community and so I would definitely say he had a major impact on my getting into politics,” he says.
Another early source of inspiration was former President John F. Kennedy, who was assassinated when Maher was five. “I think that sense of giving back to the community and people stepping up to be heard is something that I admired both as a young child and something that shaped me a little bit as a teen,” Maher says.
During his tenure, Maher has worked to improve the quality public education in Cambridge, both in terms of programs and facilities.
Maher recently worked to pass the Innovation Agenda to improve Cambridge public education, an initiative that will revamp public schools. The schools, which used to be K-8, will now be K-5, and Cambridge will see the advent of 6-8 schools. Roughly 80 children per grade will attend each of these 4 junior high school campuses. This change will be implemented in September 2012.
Maher calls the initiative “amazing,” adding that the end goal is to create more academically rigorous schools.
In addition, Maher has overseen the renovation of Cambridge Rindge and Latin, the city’s high school.
Coupled with four elementary schools that Maher will be rebuilding, the total construction price is over a quarter of a billion dollar investment in public education.
“We’ve go to get this right. We owe it to the kids that go here,” Maher says. “If there is any community that can do it right it is Cambridge,” adding that Cambridge spends more money per student than any other city in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
Ruby Pierce, a friend of Maher who worked at Cambridge Rindge and Latin for 34 years and the Cambridge NAACP Education Chair, emphasizes the importance of Maher’s work, noting the glaring discrepancy that currently exists between the quality levels at different public lower schools. She says that she can usually identify which school each high school student went to just by talking to them.
Pierce says that Maher brought together a divided school committee to pass this educational agenda. She said she believes that if Maher is not reelected to the city council it could be “detrimental” to the implementation of his plan.
“I hope David can continue this dream of ours. It is heartbreaking that not every kid is not treated equally,” she says.
But Virginia W. Childs, Cambridge public school parent, is critical of the educational plan.  “I don’t think they really listened to the parents in favor of the K-8 model,” she says.  She believes that the transition to new 6-8 schools will foster social angst that will detract from academic success.  Furthermore, the middle school students will no longer serve as role models on campus for the younger students.
In addition to his work on education, Maher, who spent two decades as a the director of the nonprofit organization Development for Cambridge Family and Children’s Services, has been an public health and environmental advocate. He has launched a campaign to inform young people about the harmful effects of cigarettes and other tobacco products, and passed legislation to make all Cambridge work places smoke-free zones.
Maher also says he is committed to maintaining the quality and vibrancy of neighborhoods, noting the economic strain the community currently suffers. “I am painfully aware of the challenges people are facing right now,” Maher says of the economy.
He has worked to form neighborhood coalitions, revitalize Central Square, and expand outdoor spaces. Maher has also attempted to forge relationships among the city and its businesses and schools. One of his projects as Mayor is to develop a formalized relationship between Cambridge businesses, universities, and public schools. As First Chair of the City’s University Relations Committee, Maher was in charge of the negotiations that led to Harvard’s agreement to build and finance affordable housing and a new parking lot on Memorial Drive.
Maher has fought to promote affordable housing through a variety of initiatives such as the Community Preservation Act. This initiative ensures that Cambridge spends $11 million annually on affordable housing. His Silver Ribbon Commission works to assess the future needs of seniors.
Maher says he believes that young people are especially hard hit by the current job market. College graduates are increasingly living at home, entering low-paying jobs, or taking jobs that are not career-oriented or specific to their education.
“David believes in everyone,” says Pierce. “Everyone has an opportunity in Cambridge.  He believes that no matter what background you come from, you deserve the same thing as everyone else.”
“This is probably the most challenging time for young people in a very long period of time,” Maher says. “My hope is that we are starting to see a recovery that offers more opportunities for young people. I just don’t want young people to feel like they are left behind.”
Attorney James J. Rafferty grew up with Maher in West Cambridge and served for a term with him on the Cambridge School Council. Rafferty says that throughout Maher’s long tenure in Cambridge politics, he has maintained the enthusiasm, committed work ethic, and energy with which he began his political career. And he cites Maher’s “impressive” mediating skills as a vital asset to the city.
“He cares immensely about Cambridge and all of its neighborhoods.  You don’t get the sense that it is a stepping-stone,” he says. “He always wants to make this a better place.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Don’t say I’ve been on the council a very long time, I’m not that old,” says Cambridge City Councillor Timothy J. Toomey Jr., laughing. “Though I’ve got a few years under my belt,” he adds.
As a City Councillor since 1990 and a State Representative since 1993, Toomey says that he hopes “the big thing that people will recognize is my many years of service.”
With Council terms set at just two years, Toomey has seen his fair share of elections in the two decades he’s served.
“I’m doing everything I usually do—going to door-to-door, reconnecting with people, meeting the new people who’ve moved in,” he says of his election strategy this year.
Despite his long-standing incumbent status, Toomey warns that “until the voters have spoken, you don’t take anything for granted.” Nonetheless, his current campaign manager, Dan Weber, successfully guided Toomey to reelection in 2009, and their present attempt seems promising as well: the Toomey campaign raised the fourth highest amount in contributions, $23,915, from January 1 to September 23, according to the Cambridge Chronicle. Weber is looking to repeat their previous success, noting that the campaign is innovating this year by building an online and social media presence.
VOICE FOR THE CAMBRIDGE CONSTITUENCY?
Toomey holds a unique position in Cambridge politics because of his status as both a State Representative and City Councillor. Not since 2004 has his candidacy for the position in the State legislature been challenged, then by Harvard Kennedy School graduate Avi Green. In that closely-fought primary, Green accused Toomey of neglecting Somerville as a consequence of the dual-positions he holds.
Toomey dismisses the idea that he is unable to address his entire constituency effectively.
“Voters obviously want me in both positions, or otherwise they wouldn’t be sending me back,” says Toomey, who won the 2004 primary with 54 percent of the vote. “There’s no question that the two positions definitely complement each other in big ways,” he adds, describing how he is able to advocate directly to Mass. Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 in his position as a Representative. One issue that he says has benefited from his dual role is the potential extension of the Green Line, an issue that Toomey says is important to his Cambridge constituency.
But Green maintains that Toomey, along with other City Councilors, neglect some of their constituents. According to Green, now the Executive Director of civic organization MASSVote, the low turnout that characterizes off-year elections allows city councilors to get by with addressing only a portion of the population.
“Right now, city councilors ... focus their campaigns on the very small number of people who reliably vote in municipal elections,” said Green. “That makes strategic sense for them, but it’s not good for democracy.”
CAMBRIDGE, BORN AND BRED
Unlike his once-challenger Green, Toomey is native to Cambridge, a distinction he says helps him serve the community. Recalling the days of his Cambridge childhood in the 1950s, before housing prices skyrocketed, Toomey harkens back to a time where Cambridge was more accessible.
“The biggest change in Cambridge over the past few decades has been that the middle class is rapidly diminishing,” says Toomey, who plans to maintain a low, stable tax rate to attrac the middle class back to Cambridge.
“I don’t want to see this place become the city of the haves and the have-nots.”
Despite the decline of the middle-class in the City, Toomey says he has a deep love for his hometown.
“We were multicultural before anyone else even knew what it was,” he jokes, adding that he “wouldn’t have traded [his] childhood in Cambridge for anywhere else in the country.”
Toomey is also quick to praise the transformation of industry in Cambridge. For example, the neighborhood where Toomey’s grandmother used to dip chocolate in a candy factory sixty years ago has now been transformed into a scientific hub surrounding the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
“We have to keep doing a good job at preparing our kids to enter into that new type of workplace,” Toomey says.
JOBS, JOBS, JOBS
Preparing for the changes in the economy and Cambridge’s own industries are facing are at the top of Toomey’s agenda. Key among those considerations is the city’s relationship with Boston proper. In February 2011, for example, the City Council voiced concerns about Cambridge-based pharmaceutical company Vertex’s decision to move its headquarters to Boston, leading to the loss of an estimated 1,600 jobs. Toomey was among those who criticized the move in February, and stands by his sentiments today.
“Boston is doing everything in its power to take companies away from Cambridge, and my position is that we have to be very proactive to defend against that,” he says. Highlighting the various construction projects and business openings around the city, Toomey notes that Cambridge would have to match the incentives, tax or otherwise, that Boston offers. Drawing a distinction between himself and other Councillors who want to work more closely with the city, Toomey outlines a plan of greater communication with Cambridge business associations and companies to ensure their needs are being met.
“Do I blame Boston for trying to do this?“ asks Toomey. “No. We just can’t afford to let Cambridge [lose businesses].”
THE HARVARD COMMUNITY
Toomey remembers his first interaction with Harvard fondly, when in the sixth grade he was one of six students chosen to receive help from a tutor through the Philips Brooks House. “I was very fortunate to have that experience,” says Toomey. “It had a huge impact on my life, in getting me where I am today.”
“I probably would never have walked through Harvard Yard otherwise,” he says. “The most important thing is for Harvard students to get involved in the community.”
Speaking of Harvard as an institution, however, Toomey admits that he always wishes it was more supportive of the city.
“I did a calculation a few years ago that found that, in just the first few hours of the year, the interest Harvard makes on its endowment pays for the amount they give to the city each year,” says Toomey.
“There’s no question that Harvard does a lot, and it shouldn’t be unappreciated, but I always feel that financially, they could contribute more,” he adds.

Charles W. Marquardt is running for Cambridge City Council again this year, hoping to bring a different perspective to the race.
Marquardt, a local business owner and CPA, says he believes, now more than ever, that the City Council could use a different point of view, and is hoping to bring his own skill set to the council.
“My background is different than the other candidate’s backgrounds, I see a different part of Cambridge,” he says.
Marquardt’s business experience may be important to voters, as well. “A business background is key,” says Cambridge resident Cynthia J. Terwilliger. “I’ve seen Mr. Marquardt in the city council meetings. He really knows the budget issues and can speak to them.”
Marquardt foresees the next few years as ones of change for Cambridge, and says he feels that fresh leadership and new perspectives will help move the city forward.
Marquardt says he sees Cambridge as a rapidly developing city and wants to ensure that the evolution benefits the citizens of Cambridge, emphasizing that the change needs to respect the different cultures that pervade Cambridge’s neighborhoods.
“Each neighborhood has a style that I want to preserve and protect,” says Marquardt. “There are some neighborhoods that can take density, and some that cannot.”
Terwilliger, who lives in an area where there is ongoing development, says that she appreciates Marquardt’s commitment to work with the neighborhoods.
A key aspect of Marquardt’s campaign is dealing with what he calls the “unglamorous” aspects of the city infrastructure, such as the underground pipe system that deals with plumbing and water. Marquardt acknowledges that dealing with plumbing is not the most sensational aspect of government, but says it is a real issue within the purview of the City Council, and one that needs to be considered.
“City Council can affect sidewalks, underground work. It’s something they can actually do,” says Marquardt. “I want to simplify what the government does,” he continued.
As City Manager Robert W. Healy’s 30-year term runs to an end, Marquardt predicts that the task of appointing a new City Manager will fall to the City Council.
Marquardt plans to work with the other council members to create a description of the position of City Manager and cast a wide net to find the best person for the job. Marquardt also says that he believes it is an important part of the job of the City Council to make sure that the transition period for a new City Manager goes smoothly.
Marquardt points to the nearly $10 million settlement of the wrongful-termination lawsuit Malvina Monteiro vs. City of Cambridge as an example of a failure of the City Council to learn from its mistakes. The case took twelve years to resolve and was settled in August in favor of Monteiro, who said that Healey fired her from her position as executive secretary of the Police Review and Advisory Board after discovering that she was going to complain about racial discrimination.
The Monteiro Case sheds light on what Marquardt sees as one of the shortcomings of the current city council, who notes that he is frustrated with what he characterizes as the Council’s lack of self-reflection in the wake of the settlement.
“We have not yet had any discussion regarding what we learned and how we can change—it’s something you see in business all the time—we need to look backwards to see what went wrong, and then think about how can we apply those lessons to moving forward,” Marquardt explained.
Marquardt hopes to look to the universities for better planning in city council, mimicking the academic process of making long-term plans.
“I want to make two, five, ten, twenty five, fifty year plans,” says Marquardt. “It takes time and patience, but I think we can do it.”
In the long-term, Marquardt emphasizes the need for the Cambridge City Council to set aside money for liabilities, such as pension for retirees. Currently, the city promises pension to its citizens even though it does not have the money to provide the money immediately.
Cambridge currently has $624 million in unfunded liabilities, which, according to Marquardt, will rise to $1.8 billion by 2039. Marquardt believes that the city needs to set aside $22 million each year.
“I don’t want to saddle the future generations with our debts,” he said.
Also mindful of the current economic climate, Marquardt is campaigning for more affordable housing, noting that the middle class is increasingly being pushed out of Cambridge due to rising costs, engendering a polarized class environment.
“Losing the middle class families is bad for the fabric of Cambridge,” says Marquardt.
Marquardt points to relations with the universities in Cambridge as one possible way to alleviate the pressures on the middle class in Cambridge. According to Marquardt, graduate students living two or three to an apartment can drive the rent up to a cost that middle class families cannot afford. He believes if the universities offered more graduate housing, the middle class families might be able to afford to live in Cambridge.
Terwilliger recalls another candidate for City Council calling Marquardt “the nicest man running.” “He has the respect of his peers, and that’s how you get things done,” she says.

Twenty-seven years after publishing “The Mysteries of Harris Burdick,” Chris Van Allsburg still maintains that he isn’t sure what happened to the enigmatic children’s author.
According to Van Allsburg, Burdick left behind a collection of 14 intriguing illustrations, each accompanied by a story title and a single line of text, when he mysteriously disappeared in the early 1950s. When Van Allsburg found the images in 1984, he published them and sparked the imaginations of readers who wondered what happened to Burdick and tried to retell his lost stories.
But Burdick is, of course, a fictional creation of Van Allsburg.
On Friday, Van Allsburg, whose notable works include “Jumanji” and “The Polar Express,” visited the Brattle Street Theatre alongside Lois Lowry to discuss his new book, “The Chronicles of Harris Burdick.” In it, fourteen distinguished authors, including Steven King, Louis Sachar, and share their versions of the Harris Burdick tales. Van Allsburg was joined by editors Margaret Raymo and Roger Sutton in a conversation hosted by the Harvard Book Store.
“The Chronicles of Harris Burdick” features short stories based on 14 black and white illustrations originally published in “The Mysteries of Harris Burdick.” In these stories, distinguished authors including Lowry, Stephen King, Louis Sachar, and Van Allsburg himself, revisit the old images and provide their own interpretations of the Burdick mystery.
“We had a dream list of authors,” said Raymo, who served as the book’s editor. “People immediately responded. We got very, very few ‘no’s.’”
One of the first people Raymo contacted was Lowry, author of “The Giver” and “Number the Stars,” who agreed to write the story for “The Seven Chairs.”
“I had always thought that particular picture was the most fascinating,” Lowry said of the image, which depicts a nun sitting on a floating chair. “I began [to write] with an element of exhilaration,” she said.
The process, however, came with some challenges. “I forgot about the caption,” said Lowry, who was two-thirds into writing when she remembered that she needed to include the sentence “The fifth one ended up in France” somewhere in her story. “I had to figure out how to get a nun in Lowell, Massachusetts, to France very quickly.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite an unexpected October snowstorm blanketing Cambridge in a wet layer of snow, Harvard students sloshed through soggy streets to celebrate Halloween—if in somewhat dampened tones—in a variety of ways, from Fright Fest in Annenberg Hall to the annual Heaven and Hell party in Currier House.
Earlier last week, students in the Yard kicked off the celebrations by carving pumpkins with their entryways, decorating the gourds in the likeness of Edvard Munch’s “The Scream” and in another instance styling it as an “Occu-Pumpkin.”
Other pumpkins sought to reflect current events.
“We decided by consensus that we were going to carve the Apple symbol into our pumpkin as a tribute to Steve Jobs,” said Matthews Hall Proctor Sujata Bhatia, whose entryway named the pumpkin “Stevie” and lit it with an iPhone.
The pumpkins were on display Friday night as freshmen gathered in Annenberg for a night of dancing, candy, and a costume catwalk.
“It was neat to see Annenberg in the dark. It’s something you don’t get to experience very often,” said Katherine M. Kulik ’15. Popular costumes included a group dressed as the cast of “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,” someone dressed in aluminum foil and calling themselves “leftovers,” and a girl who dressed as entropy.
While some costumes were more intricately planned, many outfits were of the last-minute variety.
“The process of haphazardly throwing together last-minute costumes was fantastically fun,” said Katherine Y. Ebright ’15.
Some students decided to brave the weather and left Cambridge for an excursion with the Outing Club. On Saturday, the club took a group of about 20 students on a Halloween Hike in the Blue Hills.
“It was kind of rainy near the end, but that didn’t matter. It was nice getting out,” said Martin R. Reindl ’15, who said the hike was only somewhat Halloween-themed. “It was really just people hiking. But we got Halloween candy at the end, so I guess that counts.”
But in Cambridge, Saturday night saw several Halloween-themed parties, with the well-attended “Heaven and Hell” as one of the main attractions. Despite the winter storm warning that was in effect until Sunday morning, many students still found their way to the party, where, according to Currier HoCo Co-Social Chair Kristin N. Rose ’12, attendees had to wait outside for nearly 30 to 45 minutes in order to gain entrance.
“Many of the parties on Harvard’s campus are exclusive, so it was good to have one Halloween party that all students were invited to,” said Meghan E. Magee ’15, who attended Heaven and Hell.
For some students, however, the trek to the Quad was too high a price to pay given the wet snow and heavy winds that persisted throughout the night. “I didn’t think it was worth walking to the Quad in the snow,” said Tara Jain ’15.
Darragh J. Nolan ’15 also decided to stay in because of the weather. “I was getting ready to go to a Woodbridge Party and Heaven and Hell, but then I looked outside and saw the snow.” Instead, he and his friends made tea and hot chocolate and watched “The West Wing” and “Horrible Bosses.”

The Office of Career Services hosted a panel Friday exploring military careers, where current graduate students with military experience advised students considering entering the service.
The panel was followed by a reception, allowing students to meet, talk to panelists, and ask further questions. The panelists included graduate students who have served in the Marine Corps, Air Force, Navy, and Army.
The event was well-attended and attracted men and women spanning a range of ages and backgrounds, from freshmen to National Security Fellows, members of the military participating in a year-long fellowship at Harvard.
Attendees of the event were provided with copies of a new pamphlet created to provide advice to students considering military service. The publication was produced by members of Crimson Serves, an organization of military veterans at Harvard that aims to connect students with resources regarding military service.
“It was helpful to hear from somebody who’d been in my shoes before,” said Andrew J. Taylor, a student at the Harvard Extension School who is intending to join the military after graduating.
Though the panel came at a time of increasing rapprochement between Harvard and the military, who have historically had a tense relationship with one another, event organizer Nancy Saunders, the director of undergraduate career programming and advising, said that the panel has been offered for a number of years. Along with the pamphlet, Saunders said Friday’s panel was part of OCS’s established efforts to connect students with career opportunities.
“While ROTC students have already made a decision to serve there are also other undergraduates who will consider the military as a starting point in their careers,” Saunders wrote in an email to The Crimson. “We try to respond to all trends in student career interests and develop corresponding programs, like Friday’s, where we bring together alumni and graduate students with undergraduates to share information.”
Christian A. Rivera ’13 said that he is interested in serving in the military but is not involved in the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps. “No-one really expects Ivy Leaguers to go into the military,” Rivera said, adding that he wants to serve his country.
He explained that he was interested in going to graduate school to study law and that he hoped he could combine his military and legal interests in the Judge Advocate General’s Corps, the legal branch of the military.
The panelists stressed that while military service is not for everybody, it can offer a great deal for the right sort of individual.
“We’re here to help you guys think through whether this is for you or not,” said Erik Malmstrom, an Army veteran and one of the panelists.

Harvard is taking another stride in revolutionary computing by participating in the development of the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center, a state-of-the-art research computing facility in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
The center is the product of an unprecedented partnership among five of the leading research universities in Massachusetts—Harvard, Boston University, MIT, Northeastern, and the University of Massachusetts system—in conjunction with the state government and private industry.
According to Kevin Casey, Harvard’s senior director of federal and state relations, the partnership among the universities naturally sprung from a “galvanizing common need” for enhanced computing power.
“It’s a problem that each individual institution and those all across the country are facing and trying to solve on their own, but it’s one where you’re continually trying to keep ahead of the wave,” Casey said. “As you’re bringing on new capacity, you’re still looking for more and more capacity.”
The facility will provide researchers with the computing power necessary to tackle pressing issues in a variety of areas such as global climate change modelling, cyber-security, infectious disease research, drug discovery, and education.
“Today’s supercomputers have the combined power of hundreds of thousands of home computers and run quadrillions of calculations per second,” said Andrei E. Ruckenstein ’77, a professor at BU and the president of the center. “This is what ‘super’ refers to.”
Construction began on August 25 at the former site of Mastex Industries in downtown Holyoke. The Holyoke site was chosen for its central location, hydroelectric power resources, and significant savings in power expenses—electricity costs roughly half the Boston price.
“It’s a very frugal and very sensible strategic thing in terms of energy,” said James Cuff, director of research computing and chief technology at Harvard. “We reduce the energy costs and that allows us to do more science.”
The cost of the two-story, 90,000 square-foot complex is estimated at roughly $168 million, with each of the universities contributing $10 million towards development. In addition to other sources, Cisco Systems, Inc. and EMC Corporation also contributed $5 million and the state government contributed $25 million.
The facility itself will house the hardware supporting the computational research needs of the universities. But the majority of the research relying on the facility will be conducted remotely, taking advantage of fast-fiber connections and virtual collaborative networks. Researchers will ultimately be able to access enhanced computing power without having to leave their individual campuses.
“The great part about this is, because of the networking connectivity, when our researchers access it, it will feel as if it’s in the next room,” Cuff said.
The center will eventually hold all of the computing hardware used by the University, replacing the six machine rooms and data centers in which computing is currently stored at Harvard.
“It will not exist on campus. It doesn’t need to,” Cuff said, “Computers don’t need to look out the window. They don’t need to be close to their colleagues. They need to be close to each other, which is what we’re doing with this computing space.”
According to Ruckenstein, the facility is unique for its ability to spark cooperation among institutions “infamous for lacking the so-called ‘collaborative gene.’”
“This is an amazing opportunity for our universities to think imaginatively, to challenge our students and faculty, and to connect more meaningfully with industry, government, and society as a whole,” he said.
In advancement of that goal, the member institutions have submitted joint large infrastructure grants and launched a seed-grant program for joint multi-institutional research projects. The center will also be open for use by other universities and both not-for-profit and for-profit research organizations through partnerships with member institutions and leasing of space.
The developers also hope the center will establish a presence in the community. Holyoke is currently one of the poorest cities in Massachusetts, with a poverty rate nearly three times that of the state average. The founding universities are collaborating with Holyoke Community College, Springfield Technical Community College, K-12 Holyoke schools and other community-based organizations to implement educational and outreach activities such as workshops and research symposia.
“We really want to expose the technologies that we’re doing and use it as part of a more global educational mission,” Cuff said.
Construction of the first 10 megawatt phase of the center is expected to be completed by 2013. Subsequent phases will increase the space and power capabilities of the center as well as the nature of the research. In the meantime, developers hope to intensify discussions with the research faculty and larger academic community and develop a common operating model to take advantage of the diverse needs and strengths of partner institutions.
“In the end, this is a tool that is administered by the administration but it’s a tool used by the faculty,” Ruckenstein said. “It’s their tool.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard coach Tim Murphy likes to temper his team’s victories with cautions about where his team fell short, constantly warning that the next game may not be so pretty.
But in Saturday’s press conference, Murphy had nothing to criticize. His team had just completed its best all-around performance this year. After that routine, judges would’ve all given Harvard a perfect 10.
Dartmouth looked outwitted and outmatched all night. Saturday’s contest wasn’t a football game; it was a Harvard celebration, an exhibition of sorts.
In conditions that were better suited for Santa and his reindeer than for Collier Winters and his offense, on an October night when Harvard Stadium became Lambeau Field in December, the Crimson football team seemed oblivious.
Snow is supposed to slow down offensive attacks. That’s how it works. Just ask Napoleon.
But not much has been able to stop Harvard attack over the past few weeks, and a bit—or a lot—of precipitation and a porous Big Green defense had little success either.
Of the Crimson’s first seven drives, six went for touchdowns. And that seventh possession could have also led Harvard into the end zone if intermission hadn’t gotten in the way.
And thanks to its 41-point, 511-yard performance, the Crimson once again landed itself in the record books.
For the first time since Benjamin Harrison was President, Harvard has scored 40 or more points in four straight games.
And for the first time in Crimson football’s storied history, three different players ran for 100 or more yards.
In the first five contests of the year, the Harvard offense had relied heavily on its passing game. And why shouldn’t it have? With junior Colton Chapple and the senior Winters stomping all over the record book like it was bubble wrap, going to the air was the natural move.
The running game had been a nice complement to the run, but not much more. Junior Treavor Scales and freshman Zach Boden performed adequately, but it was nothing to write home about.
But in Saturday night’s blizzard, when there just might’ve been more players on the sidelines than fans in the stands, the Crimson didn’t have a choice: the team would have to turn to the run.
And Dartmouth—even against what might be the weaker component of Harvard’s attack—looked overpowered all night.
Clad in white, the Big Green was camouflaged by the snow a bit—at times almost disappearing.
But as for the Dartmouth run defense? It completely disappeared.
All three of Harvard’s 100-yard runners—Scales, Boden, and Winters—averaged more than seven yards per touch. That’s almost a first down per play. And they all ran for two touchdowns apiece.
Scales finally found his form on Saturday after a quiet first five games, running for a team-high 139 yards. He cut and juked and tore apart the Dartmouth defense, at one point galloping for a 42-yard run.
Boden may have been the most impressive to watch. When he didn’t find a hole to explode through, the 5’11 freshman did his best impersonation of a Hummer, pushing and plowing ahead even when a horde of Dartmouth defenders had surrounded him.
Winters—never before has the quarterback been so aptly named—threw the ball well, completing 10 of his 13 passes, including a perfect toss that fell right into senior wide receiver Alex Sarkisian’s lap for a big gain. The play later set up a touchdown.
But in what became a Winters wonderland, the senior’s best moves came on the ground. Not sacked once on the night, Winters averaged 8.4 yards per run, at times flying up the sidelines for big gains.
That’s the strength of Winters, though, and perhaps why Murphy chose the senior over Chapple to end the quarterback controversy. One week, Winters can hurt you through the air, like he did last week in his 403-yard passing performance against Princeton.
But in the very next, the dual threat can beat you on the ground. When he rolls to his right, you just don’t know whether he’ll fire downfield or tuck it and take off.
Either decision has spelled trouble for opposing defenses in Winters’ last two starts.
The Harvard offense wasn’t the only Crimson squad that dominated on Saturday night.
The Crimson defense had a night to remember too, suffocating the Big Green attack. Most notably, the vaunted Harvard defensive line held Dartmouth running back and reigning Ivy League Player of the Year Nick Schwieger to just 51 yards on 15 carries.
But for Harvard, the biggest news from this weekend may not have come at the Stadium. Earlier in the day, 90 years to the day after Harvard fell to Centre College in a 6-0 upset, Brown topped Penn—by a score of 6-0, naturally—to end the Quakers’ 18-game league winning streak.
By dethroning the king, the Bears have left the Ivy throne wide open. And now, as the last undefeated team left in the Ancient Eight, it’s Harvard’s crown to lose.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 2011 Harvard football team continues to do things that no Crimson squad has done in a very long time.
For the past few weeks, it was an extraordinary passing game that led Harvard to wins.
Junior Colton Chapple and senior Collier Winters tied the Crimson all-time record, set in 1953, with back-to-back games of five touchdown passes. During that period, Chapple (against Cornell) and Winters (against Princeton) became the third and fourth Crimson quarterbacks to ever throw for over 400 yards in a contest. And last week, Winters’ 34 completions were second-most in Harvard’s history.
Amid heavy snowfall at Harvard Stadium during Saturday night’s game against Dartmouth, the Crimson passing game was limited to just 13 attempts.
But that didn’t matter one bit, as Harvard was still able to put together a dominant offensive performance by taking to the ground, rushing for 395 yards and continuing to break records in the squad’s 41-10 win.
Winters, junior running back Treavor Scales, and freshman running back Zach Boden each gained over 100 yards on the ground against the Big Green, helping the Crimson score at least 40 points in four straight contests for the first time since 1890.
It was the first time Harvard has ever had three players rush for at least 100 yards in a game. Each also scored two touchdowns.
Scales finished with 139 yards, a career high, on just 18 carries. It was he who set the tone early, finding a hole between left guard and left tackle and busting loose on a 42-yard scamper on Harvard’s first possession. That would set up a 13-yard touchdown run by Winters, who stutter-stepped through a big hole up the middle on his way to the end zone.
“Our offensive line did a fantastic job,” Winters said. “We knew coming in with the weather we were going to have to rush the ball, and we were able to do that.”
Later in the opening period, Harvard got great field position at the Dartmouth 44 after a 43-yard kick return by freshman Seitu Smith III. From there, Boden did the rest, breaking off successive carries of 20, 13, and 8 yards, the final for a touchdown.
On the second of those carries, the rookie took a huge hit at the 15 but bounced right off, then broke another tackle on his way to the 10.
“His feet just keep moving,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said of Boden, who finished with 112 yards on 15 carries. “He has great vision, he can make violent cuts, he has very good speed and the combination of those things makes a legitimate running back. We’re very fortunate to have a guy like that in our offense.”
On Harvard’s next drive, the Crimson went 99 yards in 15 plays despite only completing two passes. The rest of the yardage was picked up by the trio of Winters, Boden, and Scales, the latter of whom capped the series with a one-yard score.
In Harvard’s opening possession of the third quarter, the Crimson went up, 27-3, with a 77-yard series that was capped by a 17-yard Boden scamper and a Winters four-yard score. Just minutes later, it was Boden breaking a tackle on his way to a seven-yard touchdown.
Finally, early in the fourth, the Crimson went 95 yards in 15 plays, highlighted by Winters rushes of 15, 29, and 12 yards and capped with a Scales one-yard touchdown. The Harvard quarterback finished with 126 yards on 15 attempts, finding enormous holes in the Dartmouth defense to scramble through all night.
“We knew coming in [that Winters] could beat us,” Dartmouth linebacker Bronson Green said. “We gave him some big lanes, we didn’t compress the pile on him, and we didn’t make tackles when we needed to.”
MEAGER SCHWEIGER
Coming in, it was supposed to be the Big Green that dominated on the ground.
Dartmouth features running back Nick Schweiger, the reigning Ivy League co-Player of the Year, who came into the contest as the Ancient Eight’s leading rusher with 708 yards and seven touchdowns through six games.
The senior had picked up 100 yards in five of those six contests, including 125 against a strong Penn defense and 157 last weekend against Columbia.
But a swarming Crimson front seven was able to contain Schweiger all night, forcing him outside the tackles and holding the running back to just 51 yards on 3.4 yards per carry.
“Their front four is tough,” Dartmouth coach Buddy Teevens said. “They’re physical up front, and they contained us. The run game was ineffective.”
It was the second consecutive year the Crimson handled Schweiger, as Harvard held him to just 69 yards in its 30-14 win a year ago.
“Schweiger’s the best back in the league numbers-wise,” junior defensive tackle Nnamdi Obukwelu said. “We just played hard all game with a pretty simple game plan [to stop him] ... Guys stayed in their gaps.”
HISTORY IN THE MAKING
With the win, Murphy tied former Crimson coach Joe Restic for the most victories in program history, with 117.
Murphy accomplished the feat in his 18th season, while it took Restic—whom Murphy replaced in 1993—23 years to win the same number of games.
“To just be mentioned in the same sentence as Coach Restic is a source of pride,” Murphy said. “I’ve always admired and respected Joe—he’s a man’s man, a class act, a very humble guy and just an outstanding football coach.”
Murphy can break the record next weekend when the Crimson takes on Columbia in New York City.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After falling short against Brown on Sunday morning at Blodgett Pool, Harvard men’s water polo team rallied in a dominant 16-6 victory over Columbia later that afternoon, securing a 2-1 record on the weekend and third place in the Ivy Championships.
The Crimson (8-16) won handily in its opening matchup against Cornell on Saturday, advancing to a semifinal contest with the No. 20 Bears (14-8). But plagued by turnovers and miscues, Harvard found itself in an insurmountable hole and dropped the second game of the tournament, 15-5.
All eight Ivy League schools were represented in the competition. Harvard, Brown, and Princeton all have varsity water polo teams, while the other five schools were represented by their respective club programs. Brown defeated Princeton to win the tournament crown, while the Crimson settled for a third-place finish for the second consecutive year.
HARVARD 16, COLUMBIA 6
After the careers of Harvard’s five seniors were celebrated in a ceremony prior to the game, the Crimson jumped out to an early lead and never looked back.
Freshman attacker Evan Ramsey netted two of the team’s first three goals, while senior attacker Evan Zepfel drew an ejection and later buried a shot from distance.
The Crimson led, 6-2, at the end of the first quarter.
Harvard continued to control play in the second quarter, with goals scored by senior attacker Mike Katzer, junior 2-meter Max Eliot, and co-captain Luka Babic.
Senior goalie Alex Popp made several impressive saves in goal, turning away a number of shots from close range and frustrating the Lions’ offense.
The Crimson dominated in the second half with counter attacks and a stifling defense. Columbia failed to score a goal until the closing seconds of the game.
“They didn’t have any gas left,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “Those guys aren’t training as hard as we are. We’re supposed to win those games.”
BROWN 15, HARVARD 5
Early mistakes hurt the Crimson, which fell behind, 6-0, by the end of the first quarter.
“We turned the ball over way too many times,” Minnis said. “We spotted them six goals—you can’t win games that way.” Harvard briefly stopped the bleeding in the second quarter. Co-captain Kevin DeSilvestro assisted on a goal by Babic, Katzer scored on a counter attack, and freshman utility Max Murphy converted a penalty shot to send the Crimson into halftime down, 8-3.
But the Crimson offense struggled for the rest of the game, failing to score in the third quarter and adding only two goals in the fourth.
“It’s a big rivalry,”  Babic said. “They were pressuring us and we didn’t execute well.”
Harvard’s performance was marred by turnovers and unforced errors, and Brown was quick to take advantage.
“They capitalized on our mistakes,” Minnis said. “That’s what a top team does.”
HARVARD 15, CORNELL 6
Nine players scored for the Crimson in the blowout win Saturday afternoon. DiSilvestro opened the scoring 50 seconds into the game, but the Big Red responded with an equalizer 20 seconds later.
From there, Harvard pulled away. Freshman 2-meter John Hollan-McCowan netted two goals and the Crimson held an 8-3 advantage by the end of the first quarter.
Harvard continued their attack in the second period, with freshman 2-meter Ryan Rule contributing two of the Crimson’s four unanswered goals.
Cornell was suffocated by Harvard’s defense throughout and struggled to find any rhythm.
Their frustration was obvious at times—two Big Red players got into a shouting match mid-game.
Sophomore goalie Jimmy Field turned in a solid performance in net, allowing only two goals in the half as the Crimson cruised to a 15-6 win.
Harvard will now shift its focus to a critical matchup next Saturday.
“This weekend was the final tune up for [CWPA Northern Championships], which remains the most important part of our season,” Popp said.
The Crimson needs a first-round victory against rival MIT to advance to the Eastern Championships. The team’s seniors are determined to play another game together at Blodgett Pool.
“It’s a great group of guys,” Minnis said. “They’ve stuck together and decided we’re going to finish this thing strong.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
They may be new to the Harvard men’s tennis squad, but the Crimson’s freshmen have demonstrated that their lack of experience is not holding them back in collegiate-level competition.
At the annual Harvard Halloween Invitational held at the Murr Center this weekend, the Crimson rookies dominated in both singles and doubles play. In the Flight A singles main event, freshmen Shaun Chaudhuri, Denis Nguyen, Henry Steer, and Alex Steinroeder all reached the semifinals, setting up an all-Harvard battle in the final four.
Steinroeder came out of the draw victorious by defeating Nguyen in the final, 6-2, 7-6, in the squad’s last home match of the fall season.
Overall, the Crimson had an impressive weekend, winning all nine of its singles matches in both Flight A and Flight B of the singles draws in the first round, and clinching spots in the finals in the two singles flights and the doubles flights.
“Well it was interesting weekend, because most of the matches were played against our teammates,” co-captain Ali Felton said. “It just goes to show that the freshmen are going to be important to us this year, because they were the four semifinalists.”
Displaying impressive form throughout the event, Steinroeder dropped only one set en route to his victory this weekend.
Steinroeder routed unseeded Wes Waterman from Amherst, 6-3, 6-2, in the first round before facing off against Felton. Steinroeder clinched a three-set victory over Felton, and then recorded a 6-3, 6-4 win over Steer to earn his place in the finals.
Steinroeder almost pulled off a perfect weekend by also reaching the finals of the doubles flight paired with Steer, but the two fell at the final stage to the Dartmouth duo of John Kelly and Michael Jacobs, 9-7.
Steinroeder and Steer cruised through to the finals, winning, 8-3, in the quarterfinals and earning a walkover win against the number-one seeded Crimson pair of sophomore Casey MacMaster and Nguyen.
“Alex had a great outing this weekend,” said Harvard coach Dave Fish ’72. “He played a very fine match against Henry Steer and had some terrific points ... All of the freshmen are doing very well and improving a lot.”
Following up on his success of reaching the Round of 16 two weeks ago at the ITA Northeast Regionals,
Nguyen held his No. 2 seeding to reach the final. Nguyen too had a relatively comfortable road to the finals, beating the Big Green’s Kelly and Harvard co-captain Davis Mangham in straight sets.
Nguyen’s toughest challenge came from fellow freshman Shaun Chaudhuri.
Nguyen won a tight first set, 7-5, but then dropped the middle set, 6-4. Nguyen battled through a tough third set before prevailing, 6-3, to reach the finals.
Chaudhuri also had an impressive performance this weekend, winning his first two matches before falling to Nguyen. Chaudhuri defeated Chris Dale of Amherst, 7-6, 6-3, and then used the momentum to earn another victory over Tom Deighton of Brown, the lone non-Crimson player in the quarterfinals. Chaudhuri had to battle in the second set, but eventually secured the win, 6-2, 6-4.
Another big victory for Harvard came from junior Josh Tchan, who defeated No. 1 seeded Mike Hill from Brown in the first round. Tchan bested the junior in a three-set battle, 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, before falling to Steer in the quarterfinals.
Mangham and Felton, the squad’s two co-captains each won their opening matches as well before falling to their teammates in the quarterfinals. Felton beat Army’s Donald Van Velzer, 6-3, 6-3, and Mangham edged past his opponent, Alex Van Velzer, 6-4, 6-4.
In the Flight B singles draw, freshman Brandon Parker also reached the final, but pulled out of the final.
In the first round, Parker battled back from a set down against Jacobs, but eventually pulled out the win, 6-7, 6-2, 6-3. Parker continued his dominance in the quarterfinals and semifinals, taking down Army’s Pete Williams and Brown’s Nick Newhouse in straight sets.
In the doubles flight, the pairs of MacMaster and Nguyen and Felton and Chaudhuri, the No. 1 and No. 2 seeds respectively, each won their opening round matches before falling to the eventual finalists.
MacMaster and Nguyen defeated the duo of Andrew Jung and Dale, 8-3. Felton and Chaudhuri continued Harvard’s dominance over Amherst, pulling out an 8-5 victory over Robert Sorrel and Waterman.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s one thing to win at home—and quite another to take it to your opponent on its home course.
As impressive as the Harvard lightweights were at the Head of the Charles, they were even more so at yesterday’s Princeton Chase at Lake Carnegie in Princeton, N.J., where Harvard took first in both the varsity eight and varsity four events.
FOURS
“The fours race is always tough,” junior Erich Schultze said. “It’s really something you have to gear up for.”
And no one did a better job of that than Schultze and the Crimson’s top four, which won the fours event by over nine seconds.
The winning lineup consisted of junior Matt O’Leary in stroke, junior Alex Newell in three, senior Tim Moore in two, Schultze in bow, and sophomore coxswain Shane Bouchard. O’Leary and Schultze were both in Harvard’s 2010 A four, which won the race a year ago today.
“Last year we had a really good run with Will Newell [’11],” Schultze noted. “This year we had his little brother.”
But had the Crimson’s top four decided to take the afternoon off, Harvard still would have posted one of the top results of the day.
The Crimson’s second four placed fourth overall, behind only its own A boat and the top fours from the Tigers and Georgetown.
“Our first and second four results are unbelievable,” Schultze said. “It’s just such a good sign for us. That was really, really, really exciting.”
Sophomore Michael Wales stroked Harvard’s second four, and juniors Michael Paresky, Nick Gates, and Stu Taylor rowed in the three, two, and bow seats.  Junior Alex Saal was the boat’s coxswain.
“I think it worked real, real well,” Wales said. “We just decided to get after it.”
“We set into a rhythm really easily,” Paresky added.
The Crimson’s D four finished 27th of 41, a little less than five seconds ahead of its C boat, which placed 29th. A year ago, Harvard’s third and fourth boats placed fifth and ninth, respectively.
EIGHTS
On the Charles, the Crimson had a distinct home course advantage, having had much more practice on the Head’s tricky turns, particularly the famed Weeks and Eliot turns.
This weekend, on a straighter Lake Carnegie three-miler, with one big turn, any edge belonged to Princeton.
But a relative lack of familiarity didn’t stop senior coxswain Angela Chang from steering Harvard’s first varsity eight to victory.
“Angela did great,” said Schultze, who rowed in the three seat. “For the second year in a row, she’s really nailed this course.”
In both the 2010 and 2011 Chases, the Crimson’s top eight has relied on a strong first half to its race.
“We had a really good start, a really good first half,” Schultze said of this year’s race. “We kind of held onto it in the second half.”
Last year, the Tigers posted a strong enough second half of the race to secure a win, but this year Harvard was able to hold on for a victory of nearly seven seconds.
“We were looking to gain some speed on last weekend,” said captain and two seat Tom Nesel. “The margin wasn’t any larger, so we’re going to keep working.”
The Crimson’s 2V took 15th overall and fifth among 2V crews.
“The 2V was working hard on improving,” Nesel said.
“We’d been switching up lineups,” added Paresky, who rowed in the six seat of the boat. “It was a pretty solid row. We had a good time out there.”
FRESHMEN EIGHTS
While Harvard took the varsity events, the home team had its way in the freshmen eight race, which featured both heavyweight and lightweight entries.
Princeton’s top heavyweight freshman eight won the race by over nine seconds, while the Tigers’ lightweight 1F finished second of all crews and first among lightweight competitors.
The Crimson’s top eight, meanwhile, took seventh overall and fourth among lightweight crews.
“We’re just hoping to keep improving,” freshman coach Linda Muri noted.
Meanwhile, Harvard’s second boat finished first among lightweight 2Fs and 19th overall.
The Crimson 2F also beat the top lightweight entries from Dartmouth and Cornell and finished ahead of top heavyweight boats from the Hoyas, Holy Cross, and Rutgers.
“I was really pleased with our B boat,” Muri said.
Harvard’s third boat, meanwhile, placed second among lightweight 3Fs and finished a little over 12 seconds behind Delaware’s lightweight 3F.
“I was very pleased with the depth I see on the team,” Muri said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For 89 minutes and 48 seconds on Saturday afternoon, the Harvard women’s soccer team (11-4-1, 5-0-1 Ivy) battled driving rain and an aggressive Dartmouth squad (3-12, 1-5) to a 1-1 tie.
With the game almost certainly heading into overtime, sophomore Peyton Johnson had other plans. Driving the ball over a Big Green wall and just under the crossbar, the midfielder converted a 28-yard free kick to put the team ahead with only 12 seconds remaining. Johnson’s free kick capped off a memorable final home game at Soldiers Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium for the class of 2012.
A scoreless affair between Penn and Brown later in the day guaranteed the Crimson at least a share of its 10th Ivy League title.
“[The seniors] have done so much for us—for this program,” Johnson said. “To get a win for them in their final home game was really awesome. They deserved it. [Saturday] was definitely for them.”
For a while, it appeared that the seniors’ final trot off of the pitch wouldn’t be so triumphant.
After extended pregame ceremonies in windy conditions, the Big Green flew out of the gate, almost connecting on a cross into the box in the sixth minute and then tallying the game’s first goal in the 10th minute.
Aurelia Solomon took a well-aimed shot from 25 yards away that found a hole in the top left corner of Harvard’s net.
But the Crimson showed its resiliency once again.
“Kind of unfortunately, we’ve been in that spot a bunch of times,” co-captain Melanie Baskind said. “It’s the third time in the Ivy League that we’ve found ourselves down in a hole. I don’t think we freaked out at all.”
After Dartmouth was unable to capitalize on a couple more opportunities, the momentum slowly shifted, as the ball spent more and more time in the Big Green’s end.
With the temperature dropping and the rain picking up, Harvard began dominating play and a goal seemed imminent.
Coming into the game with just under 13 minutes remaining in the first half, freshman Erika Garcia was prepared to make the requisite play.
Controlling the ball on the left side of Dartmouth’s penalty box, the rookie sent a cross across middle to Baskind, who put the ball in the back of the net to level the score with under two minutes to go before halftime.
On the day, the Crimson fired 14 shots compared to the Big Green’s 12, but five of Dartmouth’s attempts were on target as opposed to Harvard’s three.
With a stiff wind at their back, the Crimson women continued to thrive on the momentum they had gained before going into the locker room.
Despite getting the ball into the penalty box on numerous occasions, they were unable to put the goalie under heavy pressure, as a number of shots caromed off defenders or were blown wide.
Halfway through the second period, it seemed as if the Big Green was ready to regain the lead.
Thanks to a number of well-placed counter-attacking outlet passes, Dartmouth had several breakaway chances, but strong play from Harvard freshman goaltender Bethany Kanten, who tallied four saves on the day, kept the game knotted up entering the final minutes.
In a back-and-forth game seemingly destined for overtime, a last minute foul by the Big Green just outside of its own penalty box gave the Crimson one more opportunity.
Then with time about to expire, Dartmouth erected a wall too close to the ball, stopping the clock and allowing Johnson time to prepare.
Immediately after taking the shot, she was confident.
“You can tell when you strike something well, that it’s going to come off  well,” she said.“That was definitely the case.”
After watching the ball drop to the ground behind the Big Green goalkeeper, the ecstatic Harvard squad mobbed the sophomore.
Then, the players frantically got back into a semblance of a defensive formation to thwart one final Dartmouth push before reconvening atop the screaming midfielder.
“After a game like today’s, it really shows what our team is made of—we are really 27 strong,” Johnson said.
Harvard coach Ray Leone thought it was a fitting final home game for a group of six seniors that will go to the NCAA tournament for the third time in their four years in Cambridge.
“The senior class has had so much success,” he said. “To stick with it here at Harvard and to go for four years together—all those practices, all those games, all that time—we are happy to end it like this on their Senior Day.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard volleyball team (11-9, 4-6 Ivy) beat Penn (7-13, 3-7) on Friday, 3-1, before falling to Princeton (15-7, 8-2) the next night by the same score. The Crimson hosted both conference matchups.
“We just made some unforced errors, and we can’t do that in the scoring,” Harvard coach Jennifer Weiss said. “We fought hard in game three and came back, and that’s what we’re capable of. We can’t play catch-up—we have to go strong from the beginning.”
PRINCETON 3, HARVARD 1
In the first game, the Crimson took an early advantage with a 3-0 run, but the Tigers came back with a 5-0 stretch and took the lead. Harvard regained a two-point edge after an ace by co-captain middle blocker Sandra Lynne Fryhofer to bring the score to 11-9. Princeton came back at 15-14 and kept the lead to close out the match. The Crimson was not far behind for most of the game, but after another 5-0 spurt from the Tigers–putting them ahead 23-18–the visitors sealed their victory over Harvard at 25-23.
“I don’t think the problem necessarily today was the lineup, but something wasn’t clicking,” junior Taylor Docter said. “I think we didn’t come out with as much excitement as [the Penn game].”
Princeton got the lead early in the second game at 7-2 and ran with it, notching another win at 25-13.
But something changed in the third game for the Crimson. After a Tiger service error with the score tied at two, Harvard went on a 3-0 run and never looked back. The Crimson finished the game with a 5-0 streak, with the score at 25-17. Harvard sealed its victory with an ace by Fryhofer to push the set into another game.
Princeton did not seem fazed by its loss in the third game, coming back with a 25-16 win to put the Tigers on top for the match.
“We had a really good third game and some good play overall, but we just didn’t execute in key moments—we just made too many errors,” Fryhofer said. “Princeton is a good team, and we just didn’t come out with good enough consistency.”
Docter led the Crimson with 14 kills, eight digs, and two blocks for the night. Freshman outsider hitter Kristen Casey contributed 15 digs, seven kills, and two blocks. Sophomore right side Erin Cooney, sophomore middle blocker Teresa Skelly, and Fryhofer each added six kills to the game. Co-captain Christine Wu notched 18 digs, bringing her to 1,752 career digs, which is one away from tying for third place in the Ivy League record books.
HARVARD 3, PENN 1
Sporting pink scrunchies and shoelaces, Harvard hosted the Dig Pink game for breast cancer awareness against the Quakers on Friday night. The Crimson played strongly, coming out on top with sets of 25-20, 26-24, 22-25, and 25-20. Contributing to its success was junior setter Beth Kinsella, who returned for the first time from a broken finger suffered earlier in the season.
“[The Penn game] was exciting, we had a lot of fans here,” Docter said. “[Kinsella] was back for the first time and she completely lit it up. It was one of the best I’ve ever seen her play, which is incredible considering she just came off of injury.”
Docter tied her season best of 18 kills, adding 15 digs for her second double-double this season. Sophomore setter Natalie Doyle got her sixth double-double of the season with 18 assists and 13 digs. Fryhofer tallied six kills and six blocks—two of which were solo blocks—while Skelly posted eight kills and five blocks.
Wu dug 25 balls, setting a new match-high and causing Penn to have a meager .085 hit percentage–the second-lowest percentage of a Harvard opponent for the season. Casey contributed to the defense with 21 digs and added seven kills and four blocks to the match.
“[The game] was awesome. It was one of the first times we really, really clicked,” Docter added. “We have a completely new lineup and … it worked really well.”
The Crimson started the first game off with a lead at 8-2, but the Quakers sparked an 8-3 run and tied the game at 18. Harvard took a four point lead following a kill from Casey at 23-19 and sealed its victory with a final kill from freshman middle blocker Caroline Walters for a 25-20 win.
In the second game, the Crimson and Penn switched between the lead multiple times. Penn came out with the advantage at 23-21 as a result of a Harvard service error. The Crimson came back to win, 26-24, after an ace by Wu and a kill by Docter.
The third game began with a Crimson lead at 6-4, but due to a few untimely errors, the Quakers took the lead at 8-13. Docter sparked a 4-0 run with a kill to tie the score at 19, but it wasn’t enough for Harvard to overcome Penn’s momentum. The Quakers showed that they were not finished with a 25-22 win.
After being pushed into a fourth set, the Crimson started out with a 3-0 lead. Harvard kept its lead by as many as nine points at 17-8, with a final kill by Docter to ensure the Crimson victory, 25-20.
“I thought we had a great game against Penn, we came out really strong, slipped up a little bit in the third game, but overall, I thought we had a really great team performance,” Fryhofer said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The few brave souls willing to endure heavy rain, sleet, and snow were treated to a rewarding matchup as Harvard (2-10-2, 0-4-1) played Dartmouth (7-4-3, 3-1-1) to a 1-1 draw at Soldiers Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium on Saturday night.
The tie snapped Harvard’s six-game losing streak and gives the Crimson its first point in the Ivy League standings.
His team down, 1-0, Harvard sophomore defender Eric Slingerland showed off his control with a remarkably well-placed chip lob from just beyond midfield that landed right on the foot of breaking freshman forward Hiroki Kobayashi.
He volleyed it past Big Green goalkeeper Noah Cohen into the back of the net for the Harvard’s first and only goal of the game. Kobayashi’s goal was also the first of his collegiate career.
“It was my first college-age goal, and it always feels good to score because it helps the team out,” Kobayashi said.
Kevin Dzierzawksi of Dartmouth had knocked in the first goal of the match in the 23rd minute on a long drive that bounced off the head of a Crimson defender and floated over senior goalkeeper Austin Harms.
The goal kept Harms one game shy of matching the school record for shutouts.
With the score level late in the first half, the Dartmouth front line relentlessly pressed deep into Harvard territory searching for the goal to put the visitors back in the lead.
During the 34th minute, the Big Green looked poised to regain the advantage, when Dartmouth’s Patrick Murray wrested possession of the ball in front of the Crimson goal and summarily delivered a shot to the bottom left corner of the net. But Harms’ timely dive earned him a save and kept Harvard level with Dartmouth.
Five minutes later, with Dartmouth on the corner kick, Harms and the Crimson back line were tested again when Big Green midfielder Dzierzawksi launched a dangerous ball into Harvard’s penalty box.
But Harms was there once again to snag the ball out of the air and put an end to Dartmouth’s offensive opportunity.
For the half, the Big Green held a slight lead in shots, 7-6.
Though both teams had chances to break the deadlock late in the second half and into extra time, neither team was able find the winning touch in front of net for a second goal.
On Harvard’s end, a pair of headers early in the second half nearly found the back of the net, including one from senior defender Baba Omosegbon that hit the post.
And in the 65th minute, senior midfielder Ben Tsuda sent a pass just out of the reach of sophomore defender Charles Agha Obiajulu. Obiajulu, who came in undefended and slid on the play, collided with the Big Green’s Cohen. After an injury timeout, Cohen proved to be fine.
As the match progressed past regulation time and into overtime, the Crimson continued its relentless search for the golden goal by out-shooting Dartmouth, 5-2, in the two overtime periods. But despite Harvard’s offensive pressure, Cohen and the Big Green back line held on to deny the Crimson of its first victory since mid-September.
For the match, the Crimson out-shot Dartmouth, 17-13, and attained 10 corner kicks to the Big Green’s five.
“If you look at our result with the way our season is going, I was not terribly dissatisfied with the loss,” sophomore Pascal Mensah said. “But as a competitor, I was disappointed because we certainly had opportunities to win the game in the first overtime.”
The home side was able to steal momentum at the beginning of the first extra period with a series of chances sparked by sophomore defender Ross Friedman.
But Saturday’s positive result could be a sign of things to come for Harvard’s soccer program, as coach Carl Junot started three freshmen and five sophomores, including the Crimson’s lone goal-scorer and leading shooter Friedman, who tallied three shots.
“This is my third year of playing organized soccer, so my soccer IQ is not as high as some of my teammates,” Mensah said. “I feel that it’s always great for younger guys to get to see the field. I wouldn’t be the player I am today without [playing time]. Some of the older guys who are sitting were 90-minute players on the Ivy League championship team, but they have handled the coaching decisions very well by coaching the younger guys and keeping the environment positive.”
Despite vocal complaints from both benches, 33 combined fouls, several close calls, and intense physical play, the only booking of the game belonged to Dartmouth’s Nick Pappas in the 69th minute.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Less than 24 hours after the Harvard women’s hockey team (2-0, 2-0 ECAC) won its first conference battle at St. Lawrence, the Crimson found itself knotted, 1-1, with ECAC competitor Clarkson (4-2-4, 0-1-1) as the clock expired on a scoreless third period. Luckily for Harvard, after 1:32 extra minutes, sophomore forward Marissa Gedman scored to break the Crimson out of its stalemate and seal a 2-1 overtime victory.
“It was awesome to come back with the win in overtime,” junior defenseman Josephine Pucci said. “It was the first time we were put in a do-or-die situation … It was great to be put in that type of situation and come out on top.”
Freshman defenseman Michelle Picard earned an assist on the play, passing to Gedman, who carried the puck past the Clarkson defense and netted her second game-winner of the weekend.
“[Gedman] worked so hard over the summer,” Pucci said. “It’s great to see her coming back sophomore year playing so well and being more aggressive. This whole weekend has been a testament to the work she put in. She took control of the situation, and she ended up putting the final goal away.”
In the first two games of the season, Gedman has tallied five points on two goals and three assists, putting her in the top spot for the Crimson in all three statistical categories. Harvard had a solid first few outings overall, placing 75 shots on goal and capitalizing on four of its 10 power-play opportunities.
“Marissa came up huge this whole weekend,” Pucci said. “The freshmen have been playing well … and developing more confidence out there. It was so much fun being out there with everyone. A whole weekend together really translated onto the ice for us.”
Although the Crimson outshot the Golden Knights, 11-7, in the first period, neither team could convert its chances in the opening frame.
“It was pretty back and forth [in both the] first and third periods,” Bellamy said. “We exchanged power-play goals in the second period … which was more of a special teams exchange, but the game was pretty even throughout.”
In the second frame, Harvard got on the board first, as Pucci tallied a goal—her first of the young season—at 5:42 on a power play. After receiving a pass from junior forward Jillian Dempsey, Gedman split the Clarkson defense and found Pucci back door.
“All power-play goals are about all five people working together,” Pucci said. “Hopefully we can build on this weekend and how we did. That power-play goal was just us building on what we did [against St. Lawrence.]”
But Clarkson tied it up, earning a numbers-up goal of its own with less than a minute to play in the second period after sophomore forward Kalley Armstrong received a two-minute penalty for roughing.
Despite another power-play opportunity in the third that saw Harvard fire off nine shots, the third period remained scoreless, forcing the game into overtime.
“It’s great having that experience so early in the season,” Pucci said. “We’re young … and it gives us more room to build. We’re trying to take advantage of every chance we have.”
Junior goaltender Laura Bellamy recorded 25 saves on the night, giving her 42 on the season after Harvard’s first two games, and sophomore forward Lyndsey Fry led the team with eights shots on goal.
Penalty kill also proved to be an integral part of Harvard’s victory on Saturday, as Harvard successfully defended two numbers advantages in the second frame before finally surrendering the tying goal.
“Our penalty kill has been doing really well,” Bellamy said. “The biggest part of that is if you can kill off penalties, you can gain a lot of confidence. The two goals [we let up this weekend] were power-play goals ... but overall, we’ve been successful on penalty kills … We’re taking charge and communicating really well.”
Although Clarkson won 47 face offs to Harvard’s 26, the Crimson escaped escape the first weekend of regular season play undefeated.
“It was a tough battle,” Bellamy said. “They’re a big strong team. Throughout regulation it was pretty even. In overtime, we weren’t playing for the tie. We went in there with the mentality to try and get the win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the world of sports, it’s not uncommon for an event to be postponed due to weather. Just last week a forecast predicting rain pushed Game Six of the World Series from Wednesday to Thursday night.
But this past Saturday at the 72nd Heptagonal Cross Country Championships, the weather had no say. Cold temperatures, rain, and snow made for just another aspect of the race as the Ancient Eight squads competed at Princeton’s West Windsor Fields for only the third time in Heps history.
On the men’s side, Harvard finished in seventh place with 184 points; the women finished with 129 points in sixth place.
“We want to keep improving on races from past weeks, and we definitely did that,” senior Kailyn Kuzmuk said. “[But] overall, we were unhappy with how we did … we’re going to hopefully be better at regionals.”
Early predictions for the race didn’t quite match up to the slush- and mud-filled course presented by West Windsor Fields. Ivy League crews were expecting a more straightforward race this year after a location change: the Heps are normally held at Van Cortlandt Park, notorious for its hilly, difficult terrain. The course presented by West Windsor Fields is relatively flatter and faster, and the teams trained with this in mind. The snow, then, made things a bit more complicated.
For the women’s 6k, the Crimson was narrowly eclipsed from top-10 action.
Dartmouth sophomore Abby D’Agostino crossed the finish line first with a time of 21:58, and Columbia, Yale, Princeton, Brown, and Cornell rounded out the rest of the top 10.
The Big Red ultimately went on to capture first overall with 49 total points.
Harvard’s top finisher for the second straight year was senior Jeanne Mack, running a 22:33 race to capture 13th place.
“Jean had a very strong race yesterday,” Kuzmuk said. “It was great for leading the team along.”
Kuzmuk also did her school proud—the Illinois native clocked in seconds after Mack at 22:55, good for second on the team and 21st overall.
But Kuzmuk was quick to point out the successes of her teammates rather than her own.
“Only three girls had raced the Heps before,” Kuzmuk noted, also adding that one had never raced in snow before. “Seven of the 10 girls were sophomores or freshmen. That’s a really positive thing for seasons to come.”
Indeed, Kuzmuk’s praise makes sense considering the results—freshman Viviana Hanley, sophomore Morgan Kelly, and freshman Alaina Alvarez were the Crimson’s third, fourth, and fifth-place runners, respectively, all finishing in the top half of the pack.
For the men’s 8k, Big Green senior Ethan Shaw outran senior Lion Kyle Merber by a mere 10th of a second to break the tape and snag victory at 24:47.
The remaining slots in the top 10 were split between the fourth-place Bears and the first-place Tigers, who claimed a decisive victory with 37 points.
Harvard’s top runner of the day was junior Jakob Lindaas. The Minnesota native ran the 8k course in 25:41 to nab 28th place.
Lindaas noted that while his finish was “a good step” for his own running career, it was a tough day overall.
“We had some inclement conditions. Some guys stepped up and other guys had rough days,” Lindaas said. “We didn’t do as well as we were hoping, but it was a good experience.”
Inclement conditions might be a bit of an understatement—rain turned into snow about halfway through the men’s race, and it continued throughout the women’s race as well.
Kuzmuk pointed out that many runners had to wear hats with a brim, because, “otherwise, you couldn’t see anything with the snow coming down.”
But sophomore Aaron Watanabe was still able to run a strong race, finishing second on his team for the second year straight. Clocking in at 25:47, his time was good for 32nd overall.
Rounding out the Crimson’s top five male finishers were junior Jeremy Gilmour and rookies Will Geiken and Adam Cotton.
The trio all posted times good for finishes in the top half of the pool of runners.
Looking forward, the men and women hope to use the race as a building block rather than a source of disappointment.
“Anything can happen on a given day,” Kuzmuk said. “For us, we want to keep working hard and believing in it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the rain poured and temperatures dipped below freezing in Cambridge, Harvard field hockey (8-7, 3-3 Ivy) had its hopes of its first Ivy League title since 2004 shut down by Dartmouth (9-7, 4-2), losing 1-0 on Saturday.
The majority of the game was played in the Crimson’s defensive half, resulting in a shot disparity of 21 for the Big Green to just nine for Harvard. Junior goalie Cynthia Tassopoulos maintained the Crimson’s “bend-don’t-break” defense for much of the game, with the game’s lone goal coming midway through the second period. Tassopoulos leads the Ancient Eight in saves per game (8.93), goals against per game (2.02) and save percentage (.817).
“We didn’t expect to be playing in the defensive half for most of the game,” Tassopoulos said. “But I think we adjusted well and were able play effectively from the back.”
Big Green midfielder Maya Herm broke the tie after dribbling into the circle from the left corner. It was her fourth goal on the season.
Tassopoulos continued her stellar season, putting forth an inspired effort in goal and stopping nine shots on goal while directing the defense, as it stopped all eight of Dartmouth’s penalty corners.
“We did a real nice job defending and breaking out into counterattacks,” Harvard coach Sue Caples said. “We were pleased with our first half effort keeping things even and were disappointed not to convert in the second period.”
Though the Crimson was stuck in defense for most of the game, on a number of occasions it appeared that its counterattacks would make the difference in the tight game.
Twice in the second half Harvard broke away for three-on-two fast breaks, and both times Big Green goalie Jenna Stearns dangerously came out of the goal to meet the challenge, thwarting the attack.
“We weren’t able to penetrate the circle a lot off set plays,” Caples said. “We weren’t very successful with our outlet passes and our build up through the midfield.  We had to adjust and play a smaller, faster game. [Dartmouth] is really strong in the midfield. This was a game where we needed to be opportunistic, and, unfortunately, we just couldn’t convert.”
The competition wasn’t the only thing that the Crimson had to adjust to. The weather was an opponent of its own.
“Despite the weather, I think we played a pretty solid game,” Tassopoulos said. “That being said, I can’t feel my fingers right now.”
Part of the reason Harvard has been able to turn around its fortunes on the field this year compared to last has been solid depth through a constant stream of substitutions.
The weather took this advantage away from the Crimson.
“The biggest effect of the weather was moving people in and out,” Caples said. “It’s hard to sit when it’s that cold and then seamlessly transition back into playing. You saw that with the first touch, players on both sides coming off the bench had trouble handling the stick and controlling the ball.”
With the loss, Harvard is mathematically out of contention for the Ancient Eight championship. But that doesn’t mean there is nothing left to play for. With two games left on the schedule, the Crimson has a chance to have its first winning season since 2004.
This is also the final home-stand for co-captains Georgia McGillivray and Carly Dickson. The two seniors, both from Victoria, British Columbia, have been in the starting lineup since day one of freshman year and have been instrumental in the program’s turnaround. Dickson has been named All-Ivy all three years and will almost certainly repeat the feat this season with a team-leading 46 shots. McGillivray, twice All-Ivy honorable mention, has been the linchpin of a defense that has held opponents to one goal or less in eight of the team’s 15 games.
“Georgia and Carly have done an incredible job leading us this year,” Tassopoulos said. “We really respect them as leaders, and they’ve been helpful with everything, whether it’s motivating us on the field or keeping people loose off of it.”
Harvard plays No. 10 New Hampshire on Sunday and finishes off its season next Friday on the road at Columbia.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard field hockey team had battled hard against favored No. 10 New Hampshire and forced overtime on a late goal by freshman Catriona McDonald, knotting the score at three.
But after only a minute and half into overtime, the Wildcats (15-4, 4-1, AEC) struck the final blow with a well-placed shot to the top right corner, topping the Crimson (8-8, 3-3 Ivy), 4-3, at Jordan Field Sunday afternoon.
Despite the loss, spirits remained high on Senior Day, as the team was happy with its resilient play against their highly ranked opponent.
“It was a great battle,” co-captain Carly Dickson said. “I’m really proud of all the girls for how we responded, coming back after each of their goals during regulation and just battling hard the whole time. It was great.”
With around 10 minutes remaining in regulation, the Harvard defense faced a barrage of shots from the New Hampshire forwards, led by their captain, Whitney Frates. But the Crimson stopped the Wildcats from putting the game away, with junior goalie Cynthia Tassopoulos making several of her 14 saves on the day.
Having survived that onslaught unscathed, Harvard called for a timeout with about six minutes remaining, and Crimson coach Sue Caples decided to make some adjustments.
“We had a bit of a strategy change,” Caples said. “[We decided] to go for it, take some good risks and go for it. It was like, let’s see what we can do, [it] doesn’t matter if they score again, but let’s put ourselves out there, and we created some great opportunities.”
The new strategy quickly paid off. Soon after the timeout, junior forward Katelin Wahl drove down from half field to the New Hampshire circle and sent a backhand pass across the net to freshman Noel Painter.
Painter’s shot was stopped, but freshman Catriona McDonald was there to tap it into the goal.
Despite the Crimson’s valiant efforts to come back, the Wildcats broke the 3-3 tie early into the extra period, with Frates tallying her 24th goal of the season and second of the game.
But this didn’t ruin Senior Day, as co-captains Carly Dickson and Georgia McGillivray left Jordan Field for the last time on game day with their heads held high.
“I couldn’t have asked for a better senior day,” McGillivray said. “It was awesome. UNH is a fabulous opponent, [they’re] such a strong team, and everyone came out 110% today. It was a great day.”
“[It was] pretty emotional, definitely a special day for us,” Dickson added. “[I was] really happy we got to end with such a great game. It’s a good last game on Jordan Field.”
Harvard had to come from behind all day, as it was able to overcome three separate one-goal deficits.
New Hampshire opened the scoring eight minutes into the game with a shot from Frates that deflected off a Harvard defender and past Tassopoulus. The Crimson responded with McDonald’s first of two goals in the game, as she put away a rebound from a hard shot by freshman Kaitlyn Boudah.
The Wildcats took the lead into the second half, finally converting a penalty corner on a redirection from sophomore Casey Pohlmeyer.
The Crimson and New Hampshire went back and forth again in the second half.
Dickson scored on a shot from the top of the circle to knot it at two apiece, and soon after senior Hayley Rausch of the Wildcats netted a long pass from the right corner from Pohlmeyer, putting New Hampshire up, 3-2.
The fact that Harvard still had a chance to win this game right up until the end is a testament to the defense, whose inspired play led to four defensive saves on the day.
“I think our last two games have been really good for the defense,” McGillivray said. “We’ve been careful about our individual defense and really taking care of the small things, and it showed today.”
The Crimson was outshot, 26-9, and only had one penalty corner, while the Wildcats had 14.
But Harvard maintained solid play throughout, passing efficiently and winning many physical 50-50 battles.
“This was one of the best matches I’ve think we’ve played and a great tribute to the seniors,” Caples said.
Seniors Dickson and McGillivray were honored before the game.
“What do you say about Carly and Georgia?” Caples said. “They’re amazing individuals. They’re incredibly talented, and I wish they could stay forever.
“They will be missed. They just bring so much athletically, and they just have the complete skill set. They’re champions.”

Yale may have its own Renaissance man in the form of James Franco, but Harvard can also boast of attracting another famously multi-talented personality: Tyra Banks.
While making the late-night talk show rounds promoting her new book "Modelland," Tyra Banks has been particularly vocal about her recent enrollment in the Harvard Business Schools' Owner/President Management Program.
And what's her verdict? On Jimmy Kimmel Live this past Wednesday, she did not mince words, stating "It is So. Damn. Hard."
This may not surprise many, but she did set one—potentially more important—fact straight: Yes, she has been known to wear a Harvard sweatshirt, although she remains nervous about sporting it off campus. Looks like even the fierce still fret about dropping the H-bomb.

When Harvard begins its systematic renovation of the House system, known as House Renewal, the College will need to find space to hold more than 300 students while their dorms are under construction. Harvard-owned apartment buildings around the Square have been tapped for the residents of Old Quincy, where construction is slated to begin this June.  But Harvard could take a cue from St. Mary's College of Maryland, which The Washington Post reported has hired a 286-foot cruise ship as a temporary dorm for the 250 students displaced from their mold-infested dorms.

Quad residents lamenting their distance from CVS need no longer worry. The Quad Grille is now offering customers an array of practical non-food items alongside their traditional selection of mozz sticks, curly fries, and other alcohol-absorbing treats.
Feel like some late-night lint rolling but tragically lacking a roller? Craving a bath pouf to make that post-party shower all the more cleansing? The Quad Grille has you covered, with an impressive variety of travel-size items ranging from nail polish remover for $1.75  to $3 sewing kits to four different types of toothpaste.
"Quadlings don't have the luxury of having a 24-hour CVS close to our dorms. Rite Aid is a short walk, but it closes relatively early," said Grille Manager Olivia M. Shopshear '12. With the alarmingly early onset of winter weather Quad residents are grateful for the chance to purchase necessities close by, Shopshear added. "As the weather has gotten colder, these items have become much more popular."
