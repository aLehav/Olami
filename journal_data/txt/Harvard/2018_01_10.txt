After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Robin MacArthur’s newest book is a meditation on the connections between adulthood and the land of ancestors. “Heart Spring Mountain” explores the buried emotions that surface when a woman, Vale, returns to her hometown after her drug-addicted mother, Bonnie, disappears in a hurricane. The story slowly weaves through several generations of the same family, exposing how the past influences the present. Although MacArthur has written a narrative filled with compelling reflections on the past’s impact and global warming’s repercussions, the present plot offers very little action. This is a novel more focused on thought than experience.
There is nothing special about the short, clipped writing style, such as “Bonnie laughs” or “A barrel shoots by.” These moments feel more like stage directions in a play, making it difficult to imagine a real person with thoughts and feelings narrating his or her world. Not every sentence is even a true sentence, in a grammatical sense. MacArthur’s style is fraught with sentence fragments: “Pockmarked. Drawn. Ghost version of her former face.” The style is an artistic decision that distracts from the beauty of the novel.
At times this brief sentence structure matches the mood of the characters, as they live quiet lives on a mountain with little interaction. But MacArthur is not consistent with this style. On occasion, she will produce a complex sentence filled with emotional insight and vivid description. Stephen, Bonnie’s cousin, peers at women kneeling in a garden and thinks, “There is an ease to the way these people see the world—something he both admires and despises—like this landscape is a place they can own, buy, inhabit for a spell, love, and then leave, not a place they are indebted to, tied to like a tree’s roots are tied to bedrock.” These disparities make it hard to acclimate to the truncated sentences, causing the prose to sound jarring.
However, “Heart Spring Mountain” beautifully intertwines generational connections. Vale, Bonnie’s daughter, returns to her hometown—despite how much she despises it—in order to find her missing mother. In the process, she uncovers information about her mother’s mother, who died when Bonnie was just a few days old. These discoveries are revelations about who she is in the context of her family. The simple act of wearing her grandmother’s feathered hat seems to channel a deeper relationship between Vale and the woods that both Vale and her grandmother lived in. Vale’s aunt considers the lives of their ancestors as “blueprints for how to be in the world,” as if people are destined to repeat the patterns of the generations before them. The entire story begs the question: What parts of ourselves—our personalities, our circumstances, our heritage—do we owe to those who came before us? MacArthur would most likely argue that we owe almost everything.
The novel centers on the past, but there are many worried references to the future of the planet. The devastating hurricane leaves Vale’s aunt wondering what other natural horrors are in store for the world. When thinking of the storms and other natural disasters, Vale asks, “And what, then, is the cure?” Although the answer remains a mystery, MacArthur and her characters make it a priority to solve by drawing back to the idea of humans owing some things to the land: respect, love, kindness.
For those who live for fast-paced plots filled with action and excitement, “Heart Spring Mountain” is not the right novel. However, it may be perfect for anyone willing to question the interconnectedness of the past, the present and the future—even if those questions may not be answered. Despite the inconsistent and occasionally off-putting writing style and sparse plot, the inherent wisdom of “Heart Spring Mountain” is captivating.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard voted on a number of new shareholder proposals in 2017 related to indigenous rights, criminal background checks, and divestment from fossil fuels, according to an annual shareholder responsibility report released Tuesday.
The new measures accompanied a number of divergences from the University’s positions in previous years, with different outcomes in votes on certain environmental issues and gender pay disparities.
Harvard’s shareholder responsibility decisions for companies in which Harvard invests its $37.1 billion endowment are made by two committees: the Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility, consisting of members of the Harvard Corporation, and the 12-member Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibility, made up of faculty, students, and alumni. The Corporation Committee comprised Corporation Senior Fellow William F. Lee ’72, former Corporation member Nannerl O. Keohane—who stepped down over the summer—University Treasurer Paul J. Finnegan ’75, and Corporation members Jessica T. Mathews ’67 and Shirley M. Tilghman. Law professor Howell E. Jackson chaired the advisory committee.
The committees considered 44 proposals for shareholder voting during 2017, a drop from the 77 pitched last year. The advisory committee considers all proposals and votes before passing them on to the Corporation committee for a final decision. The two committees agreed on all but one proposal this year: a resolution asking that Verizon report on its targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, over which the Advisory Committee was evenly split and the Corporation committee ultimately chose to abstain.
Approximately 25 percent of the proposals the Advisory Committee received were related to political contributions and lobbying, which the report attributed to national trends following a 2010 Supreme Court ruling that declared limits on independent corporate political contributions to be unconstitutional. The committees voted in favor of all requests for reports on company lobbying and political spending, but voted against proposals for votes to advise companies on political spending, arguing that experts had shared “skepticism about the feasibility and value” of such votes.
Harvard voted in favor of a new proposal calling for Wells Fargo to develop a global policy regarding indigenous peoples’ rights which “includes respect for the free, prior and informed consent of indigenous communities affected by WFC financing.” Marking the first time the CCSR has addressed indigenous peoples’ rights, the vote comes at the heels of Wells Fargo’s financing of the Dakota Access Pipeline and months-long, well-publicized protests by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe against the pipeline.
The advisory committee reviewed concerns ranging from water supply contamination, disruption of sacred burial sites, and the history of abridged tribal land agreements before voting in favor.
“Committee members also called attention to the importance of recognizing and counteracting the legacy of centuries of abridged agreements with Native Americans,” the report reads.
The committees again took up the controversial issue of fossil fuel divestment, albeit indirectly.
Student activists have called on the University to divest from fossil fuels for years. Most recently, the group Divest Harvard blockaded University Hall in March to demand a “moratorium” on Harvard investments in the coal industry. Harvard Management Company, which had already halted coal investments for financial reasons, outlined a similar rationale in April for “pausing” investments in fossil fuels.
This year, the shareholder responsibility committees voted against a “new proposal with no precedent” calling on Berkshire Hathaway to divest itself from fossil fuels within 12 years.
“Members characterized the proposal as an unusually aggressive effort to direct management’s actions,” the report reads. “They affirmed that proposals that more broadly encourage companies to assess and report on climate risk are of value.”
The committees supported a proposal calling on Berkshire Hathaway to report on its methane emissions. They also voted in favor of new proposals asking McDonald’s to phase out antibiotic use in animal feed and CVS Health to report on renewable energy goals.
The committee also considered a new proposal this year calling on Amazon to report on its use of criminal background checks in hiring, on which both committees chose to abstain.
Committee members revisited a number of proposals and themes from previous years, breaking with precedent on several.
In April, the advisory committee voted in favor of proposals calling for Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and JP Morgan Chase to report on female wage disparities. The report noted studies showing that gender-based wage gaps are significant in financial services industry. Last year, the committee abstained on a similar measure calling for Citigroup to report on gender-based wage gaps. This isn’t the first time the committee has weighed gender parity issues; in 2015, the Corporation committee voted to urge eBay to report on its pay parity efforts.
As in 2016, Harvard once again voted against calls on Boeing to divulge the company’s business relationship—specifically military sales—with Israel.
“Members maintained disclosure about sales of military products to foreign countries is appropriate and of value to shareholders, but is best achieved through general resolutions seeking disclosure of all military sales,” the report states.
Also in keeping with previous years, the Corporation committee voted against proposals calling for companies—including Pfizer, Boeing, PepsiCo, 3M, Merck, and McDonalds—to adopt “Holy Land Principles,” a set of guidelines designed to prevent employment discrimination against Palestinians in Israel.
None of the proposals concerned private prisons, from which a new student activist group called on Harvard to divest last spring.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 9, 2018 at 8:10 p.m.
Daniel A. DeBois ’18 and Archie J.W. Hall ’20 defeated hundreds of opponents to win the 2018 World Universities Debating Championship last week, becoming the third Harvard team to take first prize in the international competition in the last five years.
Hosted in Mexico City, Mexico from Dec. 27 to Jan. 4, the tournament featured more than 300 teams from roughly 90 countries. DeBois and Hall, a Crimson News editor, comprised one of four teams that the Harvard College Debating Union sent to Mexico.
After waiting hours to hear the final decision, the duo jumped up and down when judges announced them as the winners in a 5–4 vote over Princeton University, DeBois said.
“There was a lot of jumping around and hugging,” said DeBois, who serves as president of the College’s debating union. “I almost forget exactly what happened because it was just so exciting.”
The victory marks the fourth time a Harvard team has ever won the international competition. Harvard last won the competition in 2016.
Though DeBois and Hall came away with the ultimate title, all of Harvard’s teams did well, coaches said. For the first time in Harvard history, all of the College’s teams made it to the elimination rounds after competing in the preliminary rounds, according to DeBois.
Harvard debaters and coaches said preparation for the competition was intense; they particularly noted American debaters had to work hard to adapt to British Parliamentary debating style, the format used in the tournament. More generally, all debaters must be prepared with an expansive arsenal of arguments and up-to-date information.
Joshua P. Zoffer ’14, a former debating union president and coach, said adapting to the British debating format can be “like learning a second language.”
Moreover, “the Worlds topics can be on anything and you don’t find them out until fifteen minutes ahead of time,” said Zoffer, a former World Universities Debating champion himself.
Fanelesibonge S. Mashwama ’17, who won the international tournament in 2016 and formerly serves as president of the debating union, traveled to Mexico City to support DeBois and Hall. Mashwama said strategizing for debate competitions involves analysis of past tournament performances and assessment of opponents.
“You just go and you hope, it’s sort of a crapshoot to be totally honest,” Mashwama said.
This year’s final topic was unlike any other topic assigned during the tournament, DeBois said. The teams were asked to choose between saving the life of a single child and extending the lives of a handful of adults by a decade.
“What we saw with Danny and Archie in the final is certainly that they didn’t know any more than any other team,” said debate team coach Sarah M.C. Balakrishnan, who is pursuing a doctoral degree in history at Harvard.
“They weren’t more informed. They weren’t luckier. They were just better debaters, and that’s why they won the finals,” Balakrishnan added.
The 2018 tournament will be the last debating competition either DeBois or Hall compete in, the duo said. DeBois said his debating career is finished given he is a senior and will soon graduate. Hall, however, has chosen to retire from competition as a sophomore, though he said he will still help judge and organize competitions for Harvard's debate team.
“I am definitely going to miss the team, and I am going to try and stay involved helping younger people,” DeBois said. “I told myself I loved debating for seven and a half years now, and this was the last chance I had to do something that I really enjoyed competitively.”
Cliodhna D. Ni Cheileachair, one of Harvard’s debate coaches and a student at the Law School, said it is “heartbreaking” to have Hall leave. She added, though, that the team’s recent victory is “really significant for next semester, for keeping [their] momentum up.”
Zoffer said he thinks debate trains the mind to evaluate global issues rigorously—an effect heightened by participation in the World Universities Debating Championships.
“Doing the World Championships just exposes you to people and ideas from all over the world,” Zoffer said.
Mashwama said he agreed.
“You make friends across the world—there are very few major cities where these guys would not have friends in, to crash for a night,” Mashwama said. “I think it’s a bit of a moral education in that people form deep views of the world.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With fewer than two dozen candidates left in the search for Harvard’s next president, it is likely the search committee has begun interviewing top contenders, several executive search experts said.
The 15-member search committee, comprising all 12 members of the Harvard Corporation and three members of the Board of Overseers, has been seeking the successor to University President Drew G. Faust since she announced over the summer she plans to step down in June 2018. The Crimson reported in December that the committee had narrowed its candidate shortlist to under 20 names.
John Assunto, a managing partner of the search firm WorldBridge Partners, said he thinks the size of Harvard’s shortlist means the committee has almost certainly started interviews.
“Less than 20 [candidates], they definitely should be doing candidate interviews,” Assunto said. “I’d be losing my mind if we came up with 20 candidates and the client wasn’t starting to conduct interviews.”
Assunto said he thinks that over the next few weeks, the committee will winnow its list down to five or seven favorites and will then begin holding more serious conversations. The committee will probably fly out the final few to speak with members face-to-face for final interviews, Assunto said.
Isaac Stein, who served as chair of the search committee for Stanford’s eleventh president, said he thinks Harvard’s search committee is now likely transitioning from interviewing higher education experts to interviewing candidates. Stein said he advised the committee about search procedure at the beginning of the process last year.
“I think [Harvard’s search] is some place between thought leaders and candidates,” Stein said.
William F. Lee ’72, senior fellow of the Corporation who is chairing the search committee, did not respond to a request for comment.
Historically, Harvard’s presidential searches have stretched over many months and have featured extensive information gathering in their early stages. In past searches, search committee members jetted across the country to speak with power players in education, government, and business, among other fields.
Previous searches also offer clues to how this year’s search committee might conduct candidate interviews. Past search committees often sent members to visit candidates under consideration early in the process—supposedly to solicit their suggestions for names, but really to check them out as contenders for the presidency. Other times, experts interviewed only for advice later wound up on the committee’s shortlist anyway.
Stein said experts often became candidates in Stanford’s presidential searches, too.
“We spoke to many people initially for advice and as thought leaders in higher education. Some of those people later became candidates,” Stein said.
If Harvard’s search committee takes the same approach it did in previous searches, it will likely meet with top candidates for interviews in New York or across Boston throughout January and February, often in posh hotels or in the workplaces of various committee members. Previous search committees took steps to maintain the utmost secrecy during this phase, sometimes sneaking interviewees up back-entrance service stairways or through garages.
In past searches, it was also common for search committees to conduct earlier-stage interviews in small groups, with attendees penning in-depth memos about the conversations they later distributed to the entire committee. In later-stage interviews, though, all committee members attended interviews and asked questions.
As the list of Harvard candidates continues to narrow in coming months, the confidentiality surrounding the search process will only increase, Assunto said. He said this secrecy makes sense—committees fear that too much openness will compromise their ability to find the best candidates.
Ellen Davis, a Duke University professor and a member of the school’s 2016 presidential search committee, said being named as an official candidate is like “having your cover blown.”
Lee and the search committee have not released a candidate list and have repeatedly declined to comment on the search. Nonetheless, several prominent Harvard alumni and professors have named Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria, Government professor Danielle S. Allen, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith, and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 as likely candidates.
And in an interview in Dec. 2017, Dean of Harvard Medical School George Q. Daley ’82 said he thinks Broad Institute President Eric S. Lander, physician and University of Michigan President Mark S. Schlissel, and World Bank President and former Dartmouth President Jim Yong Kim are likely on the committee’s under-20 shortlist. All named candidates have declined to comment on whether they are under consideration—and on whether they are interested in the job.
Assunto and Stein both said candidates are usually wary of making their involvement in presidential searches public, since that knowledge can jeopardize their current positions. In past Harvard searches, candidates often remained tight-lipped about whether or not they were under consideration.
“If it were identified that [a candidate] were considering being the president of Harvard, that is going to create real problems at their institute that could force them to withdraw from consideration,” Stein said. “Nobody wants to have almost become the president of Harvard. They either want to be the president of Harvard or they never want to have been involved in the search.”
