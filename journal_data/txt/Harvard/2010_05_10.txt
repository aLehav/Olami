After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s happened to everyone, be it when you fill out a survey for a thesis writer, send in a missing form, or remind someone about tomorrow’s meeting. The responses come uniformly back: “Thanks!!!” You have to wonder: is the responder really as excited about answering as they sound? In any case, ending ordinary e-mail or text message correspondences in this manner has become increasingly normal. However, it illustrates a dangerous trend in punctuation: the overuse of the exclamation point. Although the more frequent use of this point may appear to just be a better representation of our own exuberance, the consequences of this trend include misrepresentations of our meanings and emotions.
Exclamation points are an important piece of our written language, and they are perfect when we want to describe something that we would say in a raised voice. Dickens used it quintessentially when the Ghost of Christmas Present bellows, “Come In! And know me better, man!” as did Orwell when he described the chanting of the sheep in “Animal Farm.” However, in simple dialogue we rarely need it. But because the practice of using exclamation points in casual e-mail and text conversations has become so common, now, not adding this punctuation mark to the end of a message makes it seem sullen and ungrateful. Simply ending with “thanks” no longer cuts it, although in most cases such an ending would most accurately describe our emotion; we rarely scream the word “thanks” when an act being rewarded is less-than-heroic. The misuse of this punctuation mark has spiraled even beyond the single exclamation point; since one represents the standard suffix to a message, you now have to put two or three extra points to show actual excitement or pleasure. Indulging this cultural norm incites a positive feedback system, with more and more exclamation points needed to show the same level of emotion, akin to an addict needing more of a stimulant to get the same lift.
Although using more exclamation points may not drastically affect us, it does provide an example of the growing body of ways in which we misrepresent our feelings through writing. How often does a response of “LOL” actually correspond to laughing out loud, or “OMG” to a legitimately shocking event? Taken together these phrases indicate a pattern of falsely self-representing oneself as being in a heightened emotional state. Perhaps overcompensation of emotion in these electronic messages stems from the lessening of actual human contact we experience over digital mediums. In any case, our communications, in almost every occasion, become more exclamatory than the real life interaction would be. Rather than having writing serve as a true means of expression when we are physically out of reach, these threads operate with different meanings and usages, providing a picture of a different self.
So the next time you are writing an e-mail and want to throw on some exclamation points for good measure, consider what that real-life situation would entail. Would you yell your response the same way you are writing it? Thanks!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Murder is a shocking crime in the most typical of cases. But when a child kills another child, all sense of morality seems to be distorted, and no reaction is unequivocally justified. At the age of 10 years old, Jon Venables and Robert Thompson were each sentenced to eight years in prison for their gruesome murder of two-year-old James Bulger. Now, nine years since his release, Venables is back in custody, and the public demands to know the reason. The questions that surface query the criminal’s right to anonymity as well as appropriate prison sentences for those so young. The attention and high emotion that surround such cases certainly destroy notions of impartiality and make the potential for a fair trial extremely difficult.
In 1993, Venables, together with Thompson, committed a horrific and motiveless crime when they coaxed a two-year-old away from his mother and ultimately murdered the boy alongside railway tracks. After the trial, the judge ruled that the criminals’ identities should be revealed, and so their names and hauntingly vulnerable mug shots were splashed across every newspaper. Ever since then, considerable work has gone into hiding the identity of Thompson and Venables; upon prison release, they were given new identities, and laws banned anyone from revealing their true names. However, last month it was revealed that Jon Venables is now back in custody, and the public is crying to know the reason why.
James Bulger’s mother claims that, as a relative of the original victim, she has a right to know what offense Venables has committed, and, indeed, a typically transparent justice system would condone revealing the nature of the crime. Others claim that Venables’s rehabilitation clearly failed, so he no longer deserves the protection awarded by his veiled identity. However, Justice Secretary Jack Straw has refused to reveal the offense, for fear of revealing Venables’s identity and preventing the opportunity for a fair trial. The case is not typical of any justice system, and should Venables’s new crime be revealed, the resulting hype will likely limit the possibility of a fair trial by an unprejudiced jury.
Demands to know Venables’s new crime reek of hysterical persecution and desire for revenge. The 1993 murder sent a jolt throughout Britain, and disgust at the event lead to adults crowding around the court, where they banged on the children’s van, thirsty for retribution. Similarly, the desire for information about the new crime of an ex-convict seems to be a product of natural but legally unreasonable anger. Comparably strong emotions affected the original trial, and the European Court of Human Rights later ruled that the high scrutiny and “incomprehensible and intimidating” adult court structure for a child of 11 meant that the trial was not a fair one.
The distress that surrounds a crime committed by a supposedly innocent child can create pressure for an unusually harsh sentence. However, such emotion, triggered for example by video evidence of Venables sobbing inconsolably for hours on end, can also create sympathy for excessive lenience. Despite such strong and opposing beliefs founded upon Venables’s and Thompson’s young ages, the legal age for criminal responsibility in England is 10 years old, and psychiatrists ruled that both the children could distinguish between right and wrong. In spite of general cries for vengeance and dismay over the seemingly lenient eight-year sentence, many murderers do not in fact serve much longer, and life sentence is far from the ubiquitous punishment. Although a 10-year-old, according to the legal system and psychiatric analysis, is considered old enough to be responsible, it is also important to consider the purposes of prison: punishment, protection, and rehabilitation. Children have a greater chance of rehabilitation and are also more helplessly embroiled in a traumatic home life (both were from lower-class, violent families) than most criminals. As such, 10-year-olds should face the same trial structure as all criminals, but as with all mitigating factors, their age and social vulnerability should be taken into account.
To this end, the extreme emotions that surround child criminals should not be allowed to impact legal proceedings further. The vengeful desires to know Venables’s crime and identity are unjustified; whether better or worse, the post-adolescent Venables is not the same 10-year-old who was tried 17 years ago. We may have had a right to know Venables’s crime then, but the public no longer has the right to know the details of the rest of his life. Venables’s identity is veiled in order to protect his life, and there is no just reason to change this policy.
Unfortunately, regardless of whether information about Venables’s re-arrest is revealed, it’s uncertain whether a fair trial is possible. Past criminal activity is often pertinent to court cases, and, if the jury learns of his true identity, it seems unlikely that an impartial trial will prevail. According to legal justice, Venables’s previous murder should be taken into account upon new offences but not his shocking age at the time it was committed. The realistic truth is that child criminals shake the bedrocks of society, and typical legal lines don’t necessarily adhere.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My dad cordially invites you to play Risk. Or talk sports. Or just wear a stained t-shirt and eat meat.
Plagued with five daughters, he sought consolation in mandatory family nights, reading aloud “Danny, the Champion of the World,” “Tarzan,” and the “Lord of the Rings.” During a reading of “The Two Towers,” we sketched Gandalf with pastel pencils and dozed behind the couch. Although I didn’t always listen, his treasured classics exposed me to manliness worthy of respect.
The timeless literary heroes of those works didn’t attend Harvard, but our campus boasts more than a few good men. Our tendencies to harp on gender inequality, denounce final clubs, and reprimand male pride lead us to ignore manhood’s intrinsic good. We all believe in equal pay for equal work, but Harvard’s culture misrepresents and neglects manliness in a good-willed attempt to promote women.
Manliness is confidence in the face of risk, according to Professor Harvey C. Mansfield ’53 in “Manliness.” It stresses forthrightness, honor, and determination. Admiring the ideals that define manhood affirms the life codes exhibited by many Harvard men. I’ve met many courageous women, but in our quest to prove that women are equal we deny our men parallel recognition and the right to pride.
On Tuesday, Apr. 20, Harvard Men Against Rape invited Michael Kimmel, author of “Guyland,” to explore the “Perilous World Where Boys Become Men.” Ironically, at an event co-sponsored by a final club, fraternities, and the football team, Kimmel opposed men building a group identity. We’ve heard it before: Men are privileged megalomaniacs; male groups are arrogant and purposeless.
A more constructive discussion might acknowledge that the fundamental reason our world is so perilous for young men is our negative conception of manhood. Our culture emasculates men by stripping manhood of its corresponding virtues and reducing manliness to predatory sexuality. Instead of envisioning a gallant standard, Kimmel told the men to always “get consent” before continuing on their merry sexual ways. Consent is a miserable substitute for nobility, a legalistic detour around an incredibly personal situation. It doesn’t necessarily imply mutuality, and in fact, suggests that casual sex is an inherent intrusion where men act upon women.
If men enjoy asserting meaning and power, then give men dignified aspirations, so they don’t assert their power on the dance floor. Affirm male friendships, bonds that serve men by providing forums for respect and codes of honor. When we treat men like sexualized predators, men can cunningly take advantage of this constructed freedom from virtue. Maxims like “Just get consent” and “Follow the rules” are sterile abstractions that lack exhortations to reform character.
Men do not employ their determination and honor to woo girls with mandolins in House courtyards. But we no longer expect this. Instead, we call respect and chivalry patriarchal. Without affirming the virtues of manhood, we “empower” our women by delegitimizing manly pursuit and admiration. Chivalrous romance that animates the soul is outdated, but our rational modernity threatens our deepest fantasies.
Our frantic mission for “gender equality” in romantic relations assumes that female patience, passivity, and committed endurance—perhaps the most demanding trials of all—are less equal. Despite the cultural message that “real” liberation eschews commitment, Kimmel wisely mentioned that girls generally seek something more than a consent-based hook-up. He light-heartedly suggested that girls who seek a commitment for their affections are hardly obsessive or clingy. By Kimmel’s own logic, holding men to a higher standard would benefit both men and women.
An optimistic male audience member asked Kimmel how we can re-inspire manly virtue and create noble men. Kimmel responded that there are no good distinctively manly qualities, rejecting the uniqueness of manhood in a room full of talented men.
Claiming that re-inspiring nobility is too lofty of a goal is an affront to manly dignity. But Kimmel lowered the bar: Forget nobility—Kimmel encouraged men to install urinal splashguards reading, “You hold the power to stop rape in your hands.” After all, reaching for the stars is just a cliché.
I contest the popular supposition that most young men are disenchanted predators. Many Harvard men do positively exercise their manly qualities for the good of this community, their relationships, and their pride.
Denigrating manhood harms society because when we assault manliness, we devalue men. Take a moment to admire Heinrich Harrer’s aggressive spirit of pursuit, Tom Sawyer’s territorialism, Nelson Mandela’s courage, and the stranger in the courtyard who held open the gate. Endless illustrations of manly nobility, honor, and courage abound on Harvard’s campus. To Harvard men: You are worthy of honor and respect.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I have, I must confess, serious doubts about the efficacy--or even the integrity--of the "classic" exam period editorial, "Beating the System," you reprinted recently. I almost suspect this so-called "Donald Carswell '50" of being rather one of Us--the Bad Guys--than one of You. If your readers have been following Mr. Carswell's advice for the last eleven years, then your readers have been going down the tubes. It is time to disillusion.
He is right, of course, about the third alternative, and very sensible one it is--working out some system of fooling the grader; although I think I should prefer the word "impressing." We admit to being impressionable, but not hyper-credulous simps. His first two tactics for system beating, his Vague Generalities and Artful Equivocations, seem to presume the latter, and are only going to convice Crimson-reading graders (there are a few, and we tell our friends) that the time has come to tighten the screws just a bit more.
Think, Mr. Carswell (wherever you are), think, all or you: imagine the situation of your grader. (Unless, of course, he is of the Wheatstone Bridge-double differential CH3C6H2 (NO2)3 set. These people are mere cogs; automata; they simply feel to make sure you've punched the right holes. As they cannot think, they cannot be impressed; they are clods. The only way to beat their system is to cheat.) In the humanities and social sciences, it is well to remember, there is a man (occasionally a woman), a human type filling out your picture postcard. What does he want to read? How, in a word, can he be snowed?
Not, let me insist and insist again, by Vague Generalities. We abhor V.G.'s, we skim right past them, we start wondering what kind of a C to give from the first V.G. we encounter; and as they pile up, we decide: C- (Harvard being Harvard, one does not give D's. Consider C-a failure). Why? Not because they are a sign the student doesn't know the material, or hasn't thought carefully, or any of that folly. They simply make tedious reading. "Locke is a transitional figure." "The whole thing boils down to human rights." Now, I ask you. I have 92 bluebooks to read this week, and all I ask, fully, is that you keep me awake. Talk to me. Is that so much?
Artful Equivocations are even worse; lynx-eyed sly little rascals that we are, we see right through them. (Up to Exam No. 40. Then our lynx eyelids droop, and grading habits relax. Try to get on the bottom of the pile.) Again, it is not that A.E.'s are vicious or ludicrous as such; but in quantity they become sheer madness. Or induce it. "The twentieth century has never recoverd from the effects of Marx and Freud" (V.G.); "but whether this is a good thing or a bad is difficult to say" (A.E.). Now one such might be droll enough. But by the dozen? This, the quantititative aspect of grading--we are, after all, getting five dollars a head for you dolts and therefore pile up as many of you apiece as we can get--this is what too many of you seem to forget. "Coleridge may be said to be both a classical and a romantic, but then, so may Dryden, deopending on your point of view. In some respects, this statement is unquestionably true; but in others..." On through the night.
I hope my inference is clear. The A's go to people who wake us up, who talk to us, who are sparkling and different and bright. (The B's go to Radcliffe girls who memorize the text and quote it verbatim, in perfectly looped letters with circles over the i's.) Not, I remind you, necessarily to people who have locked themselves in Lamont for a week and seminared and outlined and underlined and typed their notes and argued out all of Leibniz's fallacies with their mothers. They often get A's too, but, as Mr. Carswell sagely observed, this takes too long. There are other ways.
His third suggestion, the Overpowering Assumption, I think is the best: but not for the reasons he suggests--that the assumption is so cosmic it may sometimes be accepted. It is rarely "accepted"; we aren't here to accept or reject, we're here to be amused. The more dazzling, personal, unorthodox, paradoxic your assumptions (paradoxes are not equivocations), the more interesting an essay is likely to be. (If you have a chance to confer with the assistant in advance, of course--and we like to be called "assistants," not "graders"--you may be able to ferret out one or two cosmic assumptions of his own; seeing them in your blue book, he can only applaud your uncommon perception. For example, while most graders are politically un-concerned, not all are agnostic. This is an older generation, recall. Some may be tired of seeing St. Augustine flattened by a phrase or reading about the "Xian myth.")
Carswell's further discussion of the O. A. is quite to the point--he himself realizes its superiority to any E., however A. His illustration includes one of the key "Wake Up the Grader" phrases--"It is absurd." What force! What gall! What fun! "Ridiculous," "hopeless," "nonsense," on the one hand; "doubtless," "obvious," "unquestionable" on the other, will have the same effect. A hint of nostalgic, anti-academic languor at this stage as well may well match the grader's own mood. "It seems more than obvious to one entangled in the petty quibbles of contemporary Medievalists--at times, indeed, approaching the ludicrous--that, smile as we may at its follies, or denounce its barbarities, the truly monumental achievements of the Middle Ages have become too vast for us to cope with, or even understand; we are too small, and too afraid." Let me offer this as an ideal opening sentence to any question even tangentially nudging on the Middle Ages. And now, you see, having dazzled me, won me by your personal, involved, independently-minded assertion, your only job is to keep me awake. When I sleep I give C's.
How? By FACTS. Any kind, but do get them in. They are what we look for--a name, a place, an allusion, an object, a brand of deodorant, the titles oif six poems in a row, even an occasional date. This, son, makes for interesting (if effortless) reading; and that is what gets A's. Underline them, capitalize them, inset them in outline form; be sure we don't miss them. Why do you think all exams insist at the top, "Illustrate"; "Be specific"; etc. They mean it. The illustrations needn't of course be singularly relevant; but they must be there. If Vague Generalities are anathema, sparkling chips of concrete scattered through your bluebook will have you up for sainthood. Or at least Dean's List. Name at least the titles of every other book Hume ever wrote; don't just say "Medieval cathedrals"--name nine. Think of a few specific examples of "contemporary decadence," like Natalie Wood. If you can't come up with titles, try a few sharp metaphors of your own; they have at least the solid clink of pseudofacts.
That's the secret, really. Don't write out "TIME!!" in inch-high scrawl--it only brings out the sadist in us. Don't (Cliffies) write offers to come over and read aloud to us your illegible remarks--we can (officially) read anything, and we may be married. Write on both sides of the page--single-bluebook finals look like less work to grade, and win points. This chic, shaded calligraphic script so many are affecting lately is handsome, and is probably worth a good five extra points if you can hack it.
But above all, keep us entertained, keep us awake. Be bold, be personal, be witty, be chock-full-of-facts. I'm sure you can do it without studying if you try. We did.  
This letter first ran January 26, 1962.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A young girl wearing a raincoat and carrying a briefcase stuffed with notepads treks around her neighborhood, keenly observing the surroundings.
The child, Kathleen E. Hale ’09-’10, jots down notes about her neighbors, who pretend not to notice that she is snooping about them.
“I was a total weirdo, obviously,” Hale says, adding that she “basically trained [herself] to be observant about people.”
Though she admits she might have been a “creep as a little girl,” Hale says that these clandestine activities allowed her to better understand people—an important skill for any writer, she adds.
Hale credits her “Harriet the Spy” antics for the skills that ultimately helped her win the 2009 Louis Begley Prize for Fiction, awarded by the Harvard Advocate, for her short story about a young child who, because of her mother’s cancer diagnosis, develops an obsession with terrifying animals.
Though Hale and other undergraduates say that awards and programs at the College have offered them a mixture of motivation and gratification, Harvard’s writers say they do not feel that the College has been the most instrumental force behind their writing. These authors cite a diversity of influences that motivates them to put pen to paper and express themselves.
WRITERS HELPING WRITERS
Student authors say that they are most often influenced by other writers, who represent genres ranging from the classics to children’s literature and who are not necessarily affiliated with the Harvard brand.
An English concentrator who wrote a collection of short stories for his creative thesis, Justin T Keenan ’10 says that E. Annie Proulx, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of “Brokeback Mountain,” has been an influential contemporary writer. He points to Proulx’s short stories, including “The Half-Skinned Steer” and “The Bunchgrass Edge of the World,” as works that showed him the importance of location in fiction.
Keenan also cites the poet James V. Tate, known for his playful musings on human absurdism, as an additional source of motivation. Keenan says that he identifies with Tate’s “sense of humor” and his “self-alienated relationship to society.”
Another Harvard writer, Isabel E. Kaplan ’12, says she has been inspired by the storybooks of her childhood—principally the popular children’s series “Ramona” by Beverly Cleary. In fact, Kaplan says that she decided to become a writer after reading Cleary’s books at the age of five.
“I remember hoping that someday I might write something that would affect a reader in a way similar to the way in which many books I read affect me,” Isabel says.
‘A SERIOUS ARTIST’
But literature is not the only artistic medium that motivates Harvard writers.
“I don’t think you can be a serious artist and not be influenced by other arts,” Keenan says, adding that he has found several foreign filmmakers influential—particularly the German director Werner Herzog and Federico Fellini, an Italian filmmaker who directed the films “La Strada” and “Juliet of the Spirits,” both of which are about characters who progressively gain their independence from external oppression.
Noni D. Carter ’13, whose book “Good Fortune” was recently published by Simon & Schuster, says that “intellectual movies” are a source of inspiration for her.
“The Last Samurai” and “Peaceful Warrior”—two of the films that have influenced Carter’s writing—have strong spiritual overtones that play a role in her fiction, she adds.
Carter also says that she has a “sixth Harvard class” consisting of reading spiritual texts, particularly the works of Deepak Chopra, Eckhart Tolle, and Don M. A. Ruiz, which she says influence her writing.
For Abram D. Kaplan ’10, the most important inspiration for his writing comes not from movies or from popular contemporary books. He says that Western philosophy bears most on his writing.
“Right now, I could trace a number of my concerns and images to Plato and Machiavelli and Homer,” Abram Kaplan says. “In general, I would say that I draw heavily from what’s called the Western canon.”
For others, literary inspiration stems from surprising sources.
“I tend to enjoy videos of animals doing unexpected things,” says Hale, whose works tend to be “all about animals and kids,” according to a 2009 interview with The Crimson.
DOES HARVARD HELP?
Many undergraduate writers say they have mixed feelings about the extent to which Harvard has motivated them to put pen to paper.
For one, Abram Kaplan praises Harvard for its attitude towards the writing scene. Abram says that Harvard’s liberal arts curricula and the access it provides to “intelligent and passionate people” are two reasons why the College has a strong literary tradition. In the Dudley House Co-op, Abram says he found a “vibrant community” that awarded him “interesting and rich material” for his writing.
Carter shares that sentiment. She adds that “amazing people” at Harvard, who bring a diverse array of personal narratives and writing styles to the literary scene, foster an inspirational environment that is conducive towards writing.
Others, however, are more ambivalent about Harvard’s influence.
Ran “Sharon” Wang ’10 says that Harvard can often stifle artistic expression.
“I think that there is sometimes such an emphasis on being good at thinking that people don’t always let themselves feel,” Wang says.
In Keenan’s view, an education at Harvard has allowed him to become a more sensitive reader and writer. Nevertheless, Keenan says he still does not know how much of an influence Harvard’s classes, people, and organizations have been.
Hale says it might take some time away from campus to find an answer to such a question.
“I might just be too close to Harvard still to understand what it has meant to me,” Hale says.

A 34-year-old man who was caught and arrested on Friday morning after robbing Citizen’s Bank in Harvard Square is currently in custody at the Cambridge Police Station and will be arraigned this morning, according to Jack Albert, deputy superintendent for the Cambridge Police Department.
Robert J. Carney of Everett, Mass. entered the bank on JFK Street at 11:36 a.m. and handed the teller a note demanding money, according to a Cambridge Police Department press release.
Unbeknownst to him, Carney was given a dye pack along with the cash as he fled the bank.
After Carney entered the Harvard Square T station, the dye pack exploded, releasing fumes and red ink onto Carney’s hands. Carney dropped the money and allegedly proceeded to catch the next inbound train, the press release stated.
The Cambridge Police arrived shortly after the incident and secured all the exits from the station after they detected the odor of the dye pack explosion and saw the evidence left at the bottom of the escalator.
Witnesses confirmed that the suspect had large amounts of red dye on his hands.
Members of the FBI Bank Robbery Task Force are currently assisting with further evidence collection, according to the press release.
Though it is part of standard procedure to give dye packs along with cash during bank robberies, Albert said that this particular incident ended relatively well.
Note-passing—which, Alberts said, is one of the most common bank robbery methods in the United States—was also used in the robbery of the Harvard University Employees Credit Union last December.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a freshman, Christine K.L. Bendorf ’10 aspired to become an economist. But after taking the first semester of Social Analysis 10: “Principles of Economics,” she realized she did not enjoy the field. Acknowledging “the error of her ways,” she dropped the course.
Her freshman adviser urged her to take classes that she would enjoy for their own sake, explaining that her concentration would fall into place from there.
After dabbling in music, literature, and theater classes that spring, Bendorf decided to design a special concentration in Dramatic Literature and Practice. It consists of both English department classes in dramatic literature and Dramatic Arts courses in acting.
After graduation, Bendorf—who has performed in several student theater productions at Harvard, including “Into the Woods” this spring—plans to move to New York City to try to become a professional actress. She describes the prospect as “a little bit scary” but says she would not have felt as prepared if she had gone to a conservatory.
Bendorf is not alone. A number of students involved in theater adapt Harvard’s resources to their ideas. While Harvard does not have a Dramatic Arts concentration, students say that theater’s unstructured presence in undergraduate life has been an advantage, since it allows students to craft their own artistic experiences.
DIVERSE EXPERIENCES
Since there is not one set path for students involved in theater at Harvard, they pursue their interests on the stage, in the classroom, or both.
The students range from Charles T. James ’09-’10, who is working toward a secondary field in Dramatic Arts, to Michael A. Yashinsky ’11, who has been heavily involved in directing and acting in student productions but has never taken a Dramatic Arts class.
James—a Government concentrator who is involved in On Harvard Time and LevSPN, Leverett’s online intramural sports channel—took his first Dramatic Arts class the summer before sophomore year. He calls it “the most addictive class” he has ever taken.
He says that he has not been very involved in theater productions at Harvard because of the necessary time commitment. Instead, he has focused on classes in Government and the Dramatic Arts.
James says that he aspires to go into broadcasting, advertising, or political consulting. He explains that no matter which path he chooses, drama has taught him invaluable skills in self-expression and body language.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, Yashinksy has accumulated a long roster of theater experience during his time at Harvard. He has never taken a Dramatic Arts class, saying he uses his classes for inspiration.
For example, Societies of the World 32: “The Political Development of Western Europe,” which he took last fall, led him to set Puccini’s Tosca in western Italy. He directed Tosca for the Lowell House Opera in the spring.
“We’re all concentrating in something different, and I think maybe that makes us more interesting as performers and directors and being able to bring different aspects of the world into the theater,” says Yashinsky, a History and Literature concentrator.
Yashinsky, who has interned at a Vienna opera house and the Detroit Opera House, says he would like to go into theater after college.
Jesse T. Nee-Vogelman ’13 prides himself on being a dilettante. He acts, does technical theater for the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, and writes scripts, including the script for this year’s Freshman Musical, “Lost and Clowned.”
He also took Dramatic Arts 101: “Introduction to Theatre” last semester in order to learn more about theater from a theoretical standpoint.
“I quickly realized that most theater here is all outside the classroom,” says Nee-Vogelman.
CONCENTRATION QUESTION
University President Drew G. Faust continually has expressed her intent to funnel support into the arts at Harvard, including theater. But a number of students involved in theater have expressed concern about the prospect of a Dramatic Arts concentration, explaining that it may restrict the creative freedom they currently enjoy.
The Task Force on the Arts, which Faust commissioned in late 2007, released a report in December 2008 recommending the development of an interdisciplinary concentration in the Dramatic Arts.
“In the end, we felt that for Drama to go forward, it would be progressive...to have a concentration, as in my department,” says Alfred F. Guzzetti ’64, a visual arts professor who was a member of the task force.
Financial issues and the level of student interest are the two largest issues facing the development of any new concentration, says Marcus Stern, associate director of the American Repertory Theater (A.R.T.) and a member of the Task Force for the Arts.
The financial crisis seems to have delayed serious contemplation of a Dramatic Arts concentration by the administration. But according to Julie S. Peters, chair of the Committee on the Dramatic Arts, Dramatic Arts faculty members have expressed interest in the prospect of an eventual concentration.
The secondary field in Dramatic Arts, which was developed only two years ago, has received praise from students and faculty. However, some students have expressed concern that a full-fledged concentration could draw resources away from student-run theater productions.
“One of the things that worries me the most about having a concentration is that if people are required to get projects done, most of the resources and stuff for theater will go to the concentration,” says Elizabeth G. Shields ’10, former president of the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club (HRDC).
Students say that the current slate of Dramatic Arts courses could not accommodate a concentration because classes taught at the A.R.T. can accept only a limited number of students. As a result, many students are turned away from courses they want to take.
Bendorf tried to take Dramatic Arts 130r: “Directing” twice, but she was rejected both times.
Elizabeth J. Krane ’11, current president of the HRDC, said she shares the concern that the Dramatic Arts committee’s resources would only be available to concentrators. Furthermore, she says,  fewer people might participate in student-run theater productions if there were a Dramatic Arts concentration.
Students involved in the dramatic arts say they are concerned that space constraints will only worsen if a concentration is created and the Dramatic Arts faculty does not grow.
Despite Faust’s vocal support for the arts, the possibility for substantial growth in any one area of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences appears small. FAS Dean Michael D. Smith—who controls the distribution of faculty searches in FAS—told The Crimson in November that he plans to decrease the size of the Faculty through attrition and a retirement program in order to combat FAS’ deficit.
Some students say they prefer to focus on other academic subjects while remaining involved in drama. English concentrator Matthew I. Bohrer ’10 says that he relishes being able to focus on English while pursuing Dramatic Arts as a secondary field and participating in student-run productions.
“I realized that if I was coming to Harvard, I wanted to take advantage of all the traditional academic opportunities that there are,” he says.
But others say they would support a concentration in the Dramatic Arts. Bendorf, who created her own concentration, says that having a clearly defined advising structure would make it easier for students to pursue their interests.
She also says that since Harvard’s theater productions are student-run, she now understands the technical aspects of theater in addition to how to act. With theater resources in their current form, Harvard has “given her more than any other school could have.”
David J. Smolinsky ’11, who is involved in theater, including the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, says that he thinks a concentration would “only enhance” student-run productions. “The amazing thing about Harvard is the freedom to pursue your extracurricular activity, so I don’t think it would impinge on the ability to carry out a similar extracurricular program,” he says.
Because of financial difficulties and student ambivalence, it appears unlikely that a Dramatic Arts concentration will be developed soon. But with students shaping resources to their interests and learning how to independently lead their own productions, it appears that for some aspiring actors and directors, Harvard’s decentralization of theater opportunities may be an advantage.

Harvard Law School professor Daniel J. Meltzer ’72 will be leaving his post as Principal Deputy Counsel to the President and will return to the Law School to teach next fall.
Meltzer initially intended to serve at the White House for only one year, but decided to extend his leave after former Counsel to the President Gregory B. Craig ’67 resigned in November. Craig, who helped to select Meltzer as his deputy, was succeeded by Robert F. Bauer ’73.
Meltzer wrote that he was “delighted” to continue his work at the White House in an e-mail. “The work remained enormously interesting and [Bauer] is a superb lawyer with whom I knew I would enjoy working,” he said.
Meltzer’s last day at the White House will be June 1.
“He’s done everything,” Craig told the New York Times. “It’s going to be a great loss for the administration that Dan is going back to the academic world.”
In 2007 Meltzer wrote an article with Law School Professor Richard H. Fallon which held that civilians held in the United States or Guantanamo Bay as enemy combatants have a right to contest detainment in a civilian court.
Meltzer represented the White House in discussions with other government agencies about detainee habeas-corpus lawsuits, and worked to further efforts to Meltzer also helped to prepare Justice Sonia Sotomayor for her senate confirmation hearings. It is unclear whether or not Meltzer will also assist in the preparation of the administrations’s nominee to replace Justice John Paul Steven’s seat on the court.
Meltzer wrote “If asked, I would try to be as helpful to the Counsel’s office as I could be.”
Meltzer, who teaches a class at the Law School on federal courts, said that his teaching will change as a result of his experience as Principal Deputy Counsel.
“I have learned a great deal about how many kinds of executive and legislative decisions are made and that will inform the way that I think about and discuss those issues,” Meltzer wrote.
Meltzer added that the biggest challenge of his role has been providing sound advice on a wide variety of topics “about which one has little background knowledge, all too often with very little time to research or reflect.”
Meltzer wrote, “I suppose the biggest achievement, in a global sense, relates to those circumstances—I hope at least that we generally succeeded in providing sound advice, and avoided making large mistakes in a situation in which it is all too easy to do so.”
Meltzer’s wife has remained in Cambridge while Meltzer has commuted to Washington. Meltzer said his wife was “marvelously understanding” of his decision to stay on.
While Meltzer wrote that he expects that Obama will be reelected for a second term, he added that he has not given thought to whether or not he would like to serve in the administration again
“When working in the White House, one tends to adopt a very short time horizon,” Meltzer wrote. “For myself 2013 and beyond is farther than I can see right now.”

Eighty-nine seniors received this year’s prestigious Hoopes Prize for outstanding research or scholarly work, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Prize Office announced Friday.
The distinction—funded by the estate of Thomas T. Hoopes ’19—comes with a $4,000 award for students and a $1,000 honorarium for faculty advisors who nominated student theses or projects this spring, according to Tarik Umar ’10, an economics concentrator and a Hoopes winner.
“A lot of seniors have a difficult time deciding whether to do a thesis,” Umar said, adding that the Hoopes Prize is evidence of how meaningful student theses can be.
Umar wrote his thesis about the relationship between the tone of company press releases and management ownership of the corporation’s stock after coding a program that allowed him to search through a database of 190,000 news articles.
“In the end, you get to become an expert in an area that no one has thought much of,” Umar said.
For Robert V. Fitzsimmons III ’10, his thesis on Quaker Oats’ “heart healthy” foods marketing strategy was a culmination of his experience in the history of science department over the past three years.
“I was trying to make a broader point about how we think about food,” Fitzsimmons said. “[The prize] is the representation of a process that I have really truly enjoyed.”
Vanessa J. Dube ’10, a former Crimson editorial editor and history and literature concentrator, found the inspiration for her thesis about the remote control after her mother raised a simple question about the remote’s history her sophomore year. She was then able to draw conclusions about modern culture from her research.
“The more foundational anxiety people feel, the more that they need handheld control like the remote or the iPhone,” she said. One conclusion of her thesis was that with increasing political turmoil, people wanted more control over their environment; for example, the buttons on the remote control multiplied from merely the mute and power buttons to the dozens of keys available today.
For Maria P. Vassileva ’10, who produced a thesis about a 10-page short story entitled “Red Stamps with Lenin’s Picture,” the Hoopes prize was more of a conclusion to her time at Harvard.
“It’s like a FAS divorce settlement,” said Vassileva, who received the e-mail notification of her award 30 minutes after she finished her last exam.

Most kids who are granted an wish from the Make-A-Wish Foundation, they often choose something for themselves—a new video game, a chance to meet a celebrity, or a trip to Disney World.
But Michael “Mikey” J. Friedman ’11 wanted to give his wish back.
Friedman, who passed away in October 2008 after battling a rare and aggressive form of cancer, used his $3,000 from Make-A-Wish to buy electronics and games to help other kids deal with the boredom and loneliness of hospital stays. After realizing the success of his charity, the then-16 year old created the Mikey’s Way Foundation, a non-profit that organizes a similar initiative for hospitals in New York, Connecticut, and Boston.
While Friedman’s foundation has held a few “Mikey’s Way Days” over the past two years to continue Friedman’s work, this spring Friedman’s parents are expanding Mikey’s Way to give the foundation a national presence.
Friedman’s choice to give back was not surprising to those who knew him. Friedman’s mother, Barbara Landau, said that her son was always aware that not all patients have access to the electronics and games that she said helped him survive the monotony of the hospital.
“There wasn’t anything he really wanted but to help the other kids,” Landau said.
Friedman modeled these visits—during which he would load thousands of dollars of electronics onto a cart and let patients choose their favorite—after the candy carts that would come around Friday evenings during his own hospital stays, Landau added.
The average gift, ranging from netbooks to handheld video game systems, costs around $300, according to Les G. Friedman, Mikey’s father and the CEO of Mikey’s Way. He added that the foundation also gives televisions and gaming systems to equip the hospitals’ permanent playrooms.
This year Mikey’s Way will serve eight hospitals, and each donation run will cost between $8,000 and $10,000 in private donations.
“Cancer research [and] all those foundations that deal with tomorrow are wonderful. But these kids are suffering today,” Les Friedman said. “My dream would be to do 52 Mikey’s Way Days a year.”
Over the past few months, the foundation has reached out to new donors and has filmed an ad with actress Jennifer Love Hewitt. One of the foundation’s first stops for networking has been at Harvard, with Friedman’s friends. Friedman’s former roommate Mark A. Isaacson ’11, a Crimson editorial columnist, said that he and other friends plan to work next fall to give Mikey’s Way a sustainable presence on the Harvard campus through creating a Harvard chapter of the foundation and possibly partnering with the Cancer Society.
Friedman, who is remembered as an optimist by his friends, did not talk much about Mikey’s Way or his own battle with cancer during his time at Harvard. Emily S. Shire ’11, a friend of Friedman’s and an inactive Crimson magazine editor, said that she did not know about his cancer until nearly the end of their freshman year.
“Mikey was just that calm, oh-so wonderful person. He played such an important role in the way our group works,” Shire said. “I’m completely unsurprised that he has touched so many lives.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Updated 10:39 a.m.
Former Dean of Harvard Law School and Solicitor General Elena Kagan has  been nominated to replace Justice John Paul Stevens on the Supreme Court  by President Barack Obama this morning.
Obama announced his appointment  at 10 a.m. this morning with Kagan by his side.
Kagan, who is 50 years old, would be the youngest Justice on the Court. She would also be the first Justice since William H. Rehnquist without any prior judicial experience.
Kagan clerked for Justice Thurgood Marshall, who previously served as Solicitor General.
Law School Professor Mark V. Tushnet ’67, who also clerked for Marshall, noted that experience as Solicitor General will have exposed Kagan to a wide variety of legal issues.
Kagan is considered a relative moderate, but is expected to be challenged by Republicans for her opposition to military recruiting at the Law School in response to “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.” The Law School no longer bans military recruiting on its campus.
But speaking yesterday before the announcement was made, Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz said that the recruitment issue was “very center to moderate” and that he does not believe that it will bar her from the Court.
“She is a very strong person and she is a strong advocate,” said Professor William P. Alford before the announcement was made.
Kagan was confirmed as Solicitor General in 2009 by a vote of 61-31 in the Senate.
At the Law School, Kagan was known for bridging gaps between liberals and conservatives.
“I think she was appreciated by the faculty of the right, the center, and the left,” Dershowitz said.
“I think she would be a welcome presence on the Supreme Court.”
If confirmed, Kagan, who is Jewish, will replace the Court’s only Protestant, and the court will be made up of six Catholics and three Jews.
But Dershowitz said he did not think religion would figure in her potential confirmation. “It’s long past the time that we will care about religion,” Dershowitz said. “That’s an issue of the 20th century.”
Several professors noted that they thought Kagan ran the Law School in the style of a government agency.
Kagan expanded the Law School faculty by about 10 percent during her tenure. She also pushed forward the building plans for Northwest Corner, and oversaw major curriculum overhaul with now-current Dean of the Law School Martha L. Minow.
Dershowitz said he believes that the institution improved under her term.
“She ran it like a university should be run,” he said.
Obama passed over federal appeals court Judges Diane P. Wood and Merrick B. Garland ’74, a member of the Harvard Board of Overseers, the other frontrunners for the position.
Kagan’s youth may also have been a significant factor in Obama’s choice, as Wood, 58, and Garland, 57, might have served shorter terms as Justices.

The goal was to be in the top four.
Despite strong individual performances that garnered points for both squads, the Harvard men’s and women’s track and field teams could not crawl out of the bottom half. Both teams finished this past weekend’s outdoor Heptagonal Championships in Princeton, N.J. in seventh place out of the eight Ivy League schools competing to end the spring season.
“Individually there were some outstanding performances,” Crimson coach Jason Saretsky said.  “We were right in the mix of it but had some things not go right. That’s how the sport is. This time we just didn’t get it.”
While both teams finished below their goal, the difference between them and their competitors was slim. By the end of the weekend, the men’s side stood only four points behind sixth place, another three points behind fifth place, and 14 points behind fourth-place Yale. Cornell grabbed the top slot with 188 points, winning for the eighth year in a row.
The Big Red’s female counterparts also stole the show for the eighth consecutive year, taking first place with 146.5 points, while the Crimson finished with 33 points—five points behind Dartmouth but ahead of the Bulldogs.
“Finishing seventh, it was a very heart-felt battle and really close,” Saretsky said. “The difference in points was really small.”
“I think [our result was] not quite what we were looking for, but there were still some great performances that were shown,” co-captain Justin Grinstead said.
Grinstead had one of those performances yesterday in the 400-meter hurdles. After finishing Saturday’s preliminaries ranked second—0.3 seconds behind University of Pennsylvania’s Tim Carey—Grinstead overcame the deficit to win Harvard’s only title of the weekend. The senior took 10 points for the Crimson with a time of 52.19 seconds.
“I was glad that I was personally able to defend my championship in my last year and be able to see more points given to more people than [during] my freshman year,” Grinstead said. “A definite improvement on the team from my freshman to my senior year, which is great.”
While Grinstead had one of the top performances of the weekend, classmate Chas Gillespie had one of the most surprising. Performing in the 10k for the first time, the bearded distance runner placed third in 30 minutes.
“We had some great performances, especially Chas in the 10k,” Saretsky said. “I’m pretty sure it was one of the top four or five times in Harvard history. It was great to score those outstanding points for the team.”
The field portion of the Crimson’s squad also arrived ready to compete. Co-captain Jack Brady, in the first event of the championships, placed third in the men’s hammer throw with a distance of 60.48 meters. Brady’s throw, a personal best, rested just 0.28 meters behind the second-place effort, despite high wind at Princeton’s Weaver Stadium.
“Brady especially, he always pulls it out for the competitions,” Grinstead said.
The freshmen men also grabbed points for the field squad as classmates Aaron Palmer and Andrew Bocskocsky placed fourth and fifth, respectively, in the men’s javelin throw to take a total of six points. Classmate Fedor Garin placed fifth in the men’s pole vault, grabbing two points for Harvard with a height of 4.80 meters.
“The field part of our program is a real strong component of the team,” Saretsky said. “It was great to see, especially our captain, seeing them end on such a high note.”
The women’s field squad was just as impressive, with similar performances by the freshmen in the throwing events.
On Saturday, junior Jessica Fronk nabbed eight points for Harvard in the women’s javelin throw by grabbing second place, while freshmen Ashtynn Baltimore and Olivia Weeks placed fourth and seventh, respectively, in the women’s long jump.
Harvard’s heptathletes also battled intensely against the competition, as sophomore Nicole Sliva pulled out a strong second day to jump from fourth place to second in the seven-event competition. Freshman Mary Hirst grabbed two points by placing fifth, while sophomore Christine Reed took sixth.
Hirst also tied with Penn sophomore Kristen Judge for third place in the high jump with a height of 1.67 meters.
“I was really impressed by the multi-event athletes,” Saretsky said. “Three girls who all scored. They did an outstanding job, in particular Nicole Sliva finishing second and All-Ivy second team.”
In the running portion of the championships, sophomore Meghan Looney placed sixth in the 800-meter run, less than 0.1 seconds behind fifth-place finisher Anna Scull from Cornell.
Baltimore doubled up with a sixth-place finish in the 100-meter hurdles, although it marked a fall from her fourth-place ranking in the preliminaries the day before.
Despite the amount of individual victories, the problem for Harvard lay in the multiple 30-minute segments throughout the weekend when the Crimson could not manage to place in the top six positions.
“[Each event] it could go either way,” Saretsky explained. “That’s how our sport is, but overall I was really proud.”

With a week of solid practices and a strong first day behind it, the Harvard sailing team seemed to have the wind at its back and a bid to Team Racing Nationals in front of it. But when the winds changed, so too did the Crimson’s prospects, as the team finished a disappointing seventh yesterday at the Fowle Trophy—the New England Team Racing Championships hosted by Salve Regina University.
“The thing about sailing is that as much as you practice, as great as you are in one certain condition, some of it is out of your control,” junior skipper Teddy Himler said. “It wasn’t our wind today.”
Harvard got off to the right start by going undefeated in its first round robin on Saturday, defeating regional powers Yale and Boston College, whom senior Michelle Konstadt said were considered the best teams in the field.
“That was awesome,” Himler said. “It showed how much we’d been practicing and our potential for the future.”
Having put together strong performances in recent weekends, including last weekend when it qualified for nationals in fleet racing, the team expected that it would be able to use its team-specific tactics and preparation to continue its successful run.
“If your team is in 2nd, 3rd, and 6th, a good team-racing team can convert that to a 2,3,4 [by blocking the 4th and 5th boats],” Konstadt said. “Normally, that’s the kind of team racing we do.”
One day in, the Crimson was right on track. But when the team hit the water yesterday, it couldn’t adapt to the increased wind, which reached between 20 and 25 knots.
“We struggled a little bit to sail and ended up not qualifying,” junior skipper John Stokes said. “We just weren’t as good as the others at making the boats go fast…There wasn’t a lot of team racing going on.”
The breeze prevented the Crimson from using its favorite tactics, turning the contest into de facto independent fleet racing, a set up for which Harvard was not nearly as prepared.
“Our forte isn’t big breeze,” Konstadt said. “We really enjoy team racing because it’s tactical.”
Even Harvard’s struggles yesterday couldn’t completely knock it out of contention, though, as the team finished tied for fifth place with BU and Brown. A top-six finish would have given the Crimson more chances to compete for a top-three finish—the requirement to qualify for nationals. But when the teams tied in the sail-off tie-breaker, Harvard found itself on the outside looking in.
“The tie-breaker was tied,” Konstadt explained, “[So] we had to go by who beat whom, and we had lost to Brown and BU in the times we had met.”
The results left the Crimson in seventh and sent it back to Cambridge with an unsatisfying conclusion to the team-racing season.
“I’m a senior, so [Nationals] would’ve been my last time to sail team races,” Konstadt said. “I thought we could’ve done really well.”
The team’s struggles in the wind won’t dampen its season too much, though, because the Crimson managed to qualify for the ICSA Dinghy National Championships with its top-five finish in last weekend’s Western Semi Finals in Seattle. While the weekend’s struggles may have slowed momentum slightly, the Fowle Trophy also gave Harvard a chance to continue to learn before it hits the water on the biggest stage.
“Maybe it’s just a matter of taking it one race at a time,” Himler said. “Huge changes in the breeze happen. Regattas are two days. We do two dozen races. If we falter in one, we should adjust our attitude and strategy. “

After a walk-off finish in Game 2 of the Ivy League Championship Series, the Harvard softball team fell just short in its comeback bid in the final game, losing, 3-2, to Cornell Saturday at Niemand*Robison Field.
“I’m bummed right now, but honestly, it was a great series,” said co-captain and pitcher Margaux Black. “It was an awesome weekend overall. All three of the games were battles, epic battles. We played really well, we played our game, we played Harvard softball. Unfortunately it didn’t turn out the way we wanted it to, but we did some really great things.”
The Crimson (26-22, 18-5 Ivy) needed eight innings in Game 2 to force a deciding Game 3 after the Big Red (37-13, 19-4) opened the series with a 3-1 victory.
Knowing that the rubber match was probably going to mimic the pitchers’ duels that dominated the first two games of the series, Harvard was intent to get its bats off to a quick start in the deciding game.
Junior Ellen Macadam led off the top of the first with a single and advanced to second following senior Stephanie Krysiak’s sacrifice bunt. Co-captain Melissa Schellberg, who is also a Crimson sports editor, followed with a single that put runners on the corners with only one out. Following sophomore Whitney Shaw’s strikeout, freshman Jess Ferri was able to plate Macadam with an RBI single to shortstop. But Cornell’s Elizabeth Dalrymple was able to get out of the jam when she forced sophomore Mari Zumbro to line out to left field.
Black held the Big Red to only one hit through the first two innings, but Cornell got the bats rolling in the third.
Black allowed a leadoff single to Erin Keene before Marissa Amiraian took a 2-1 pitch over the right-field fence to give the Big Red its the 2-1 lead. Black recovered nicely and induced three-straight groundouts to escape the inning.
“I really think Margaux stole the show this weekend,” sophomore Rachel Brown said. “She was absolutely incredible.”
It didn’t take long for Harvard to get back on track, as Shaw homered in the first at-bat of the next inning to even the score at 2-2. Zumbro doubled to left after Ferri flied out, but the Crimson couldn’t move her any further after senior Jessica Pledger fouled out and Dalrymple struck out senior Jennifer Francis looking.
Black gave up a leadoff single to start the bottom of the fourth inning but was able to retire the next batter. After a walk, a flyout, and another Keene single, the bases were loaded with two outs. The stage was set for the Big Red’s hottest bat to strike again.
Amiraian stepped up to the batter’s box and hit a sharp RBI single to third base, knocking in her third run of the game. But Black again got out of the inning with minimal damage as she retired the next batter to end the bases-loaded jam.
Sophomore Jane Alexander and Macadam flied out to begin the top of the fifth inning, but consecutive singles by Krysiak and Schellberg gave Harvard a chance to tie or regain the lead with cleanup hitter Shaw up to bat. Dalrymple stood tall and caught Shaw swinging to fan her fifth batter of the day and end the threat.
“I think [Dalrymple] is effective against our hitters,” Black said. “She is a rise-ball pitcher, so she has a lot of up pitches, and we were getting a little under the ball, popping some balls up. But we also figured her out. We were hitting the ball hard [Saturday]. Whitney Shaw hit a bomb home run. We figured her out, but she was very effective.”
Neither team would put a runner on base for the rest of the game, as Dalrymple pitched an eight-hit complete game to earn her 21st win of the season and give Cornell its fifth Ivy softball crown. The junior pitched every inning for the Big Red in the series.
“I think last year we were very disappointed that we didn’t make it to the Ivy Championship,” Brown said. “It was a big step to get here. The next step next year is winning. Last year we learned that it’s not always a guarantee that we’re going to make it this far. This year we learned that every game matters and that we can get here, that we can play with every team in the Ivy League. So hopefully next year everything will fall into place and it will be our turn to win it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Staring at what could have been the last out of its season, the Harvard softball team didn’t falter—it delivered.
Sophomore Mari Zumbro’s single in the bottom of the eighth gave the Crimson new life, and two batters later, senior Jen Francis blasted a three-run dinger to straightaway center to bring Harvard back from the brink and force a deciding third game in the Ivy League Championship Series.
The Crimson’s 4-2 win over Cornell in the nightcap came after a 3-1 loss in the series opener at Niemand*Robison Field in Ithaca, N.Y. on Friday.
“It was a battle, it really was,” sophomore pitcher Rachel Brown said. “I really thought it could have gone either way if we had caught some lucky breaks…We’re really proud of the way we played.”
HARVARD 4, CORNELL 2
In a game that was mostly quiet—each team scored in the first inning and didn’t cross the plate again until extra frames—Harvard needed some fireworks to keep its season alive.
The Big Red got a run off Crimson ace Brown in the top of the eighth to snap a 1-1 tie. Alyson Intihar belted a single up the middle that scored Marissa Amiraian from second with the go-ahead run.
In its last half inning, with the best-of-three series on the line, Harvard got off to an inauspicious start. Sophomore cleanup hitter Whitney Shaw grounded out to third to open the inning, and freshman Jessica Ferri chased an offering from Cornell hurler Elizabeth Dalrymple to make the second out of the inning.
Zumbro—who had started just five games prior to this weekend’s series—then stepped to the plate with the season on her shoulders.
The sophomore left fielder, playing in place of injured junior Emily Henderson, connected with an 0-1 pitch and got aboard with a single to right-center.
“Mari stepped up huge,” co-captain Margaux Black said. “She came in, she came in confident, and she looked like she’d been playing in left field all season. She really added a lot of energy to our lineup.”
Senior Jessica Pledger followed with a single to third base before being pulled for sophomore pinch runner Eve Rosenbaum.
That brought up Francis, who had struck out three times in the game.
“Coach put it the best,” Black said. “We were on our last breath, and Jen Francis gave us CPR.”
After taking a called first strike, Francis drove Dalrymple’s second pitch over the fence for the walkoff win.
“She rounded third base, and we saw that she was crying, and we just started to cry because it was so emotional,” Brown said. “For her to be able to do that for the team—she had had a tough day at the plate before that—but to be able to come up in the clutch like that is truly inspirational.”
“Jen Fran hits a bomb—it was unreal,” Black added. “She knew that that could have been her last at-bat, and she didn’t want it to be. She proved that.”
The Crimson and Big Red each put a run up in the first inning. Cornell got on the board in the top of the inning with an Elise Menaker home run—one of just four hits Black allowed in 6.1 innings of work.
Harvard responded with a run of its own in the bottom of the first. Junior Ellen Macadam led off with a single to center field and moved to second on senior Stephanie Krysiak’s sacrifice bunt. Co-captain Melissa Schellberg, who is also a Crimson sports editor, brought Macadam home with a single to right.
CORNELL 3, HARVARD 1
The defending Ivy champions got things done in the first game of the series, snapping a 1-1 tie in the sixth to take a 3-1 win in a meeting of the Ancient Eight’s two best pitchers.
The Big Red crossed the plate first in the bottom of the third, after Amiraian got on base with a one-out double down the left field line. Two batters later, Shannon Crane drove her home with a single to center before Brown struck Menaker out to get out of the inning.
The Crimson tied things right back up in the fourth, when Krysiak got the rally going with a one-out double of her own. After Schellberg popped up and Shaw walked, Ferri brough Krysiak around with a single to left.
But from there, Dalrymple—who pitched every inning of the series—shut Harvard down, allowing just two hits over the final three innings.
“I have so much respect for her,” Brown said. “We had a lot of hits off of her, but we just didn’t string them together when we needed to, and I think that’s really a testament to Elizabeth’s pitching.”
Brown, who led the Ivy League with a 1.25 ERA in the regular season, did not fare so well against the Cornell offense.
Though the sophomore pitched her way out of a fifth-inning jam, Brown lost control in the sixth, walking in a pair of runs with the bases loaded. Black came in to get Intihar to fly out and end the inning.
“I’m disappointed in my performance in the first game,” Brown said. “Maybe it was being tired at the end of a long season, maybe a mental lapse, but Margaux really stepped up. She was incredible, and she’s my hero.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The newest member of the Harvard men's basketball team  may very well be its brightest.
Ernest  Rouse, a 6'2" guard out of Archbishop Molloy High School (Queens, N.Y.),  was accepted to Harvard without being recruited by the Crimson. He then initiated contact with coach Tommy Amaker and his  staff and joined Harvard's roster for next season.
"Ever since I got  in, I've been talking to the coaches," Rouse said. "I didn't even think  I was going to get in."
Currently  coached by Jack Curran, the winningest coach in New York City and New York state  history, Rouse said that Columbia, Cornell, Drexel, UMBC, NJIT, and  Siena had been involved with his recruitment. The shooter held offers  from UMBC, NJIT, and Siena."I'm very  excited. Right now I'm just waiting until August when I can get there,"  said Rouse, whose highlight video can be viewed here.
Rouse rounds out  the freshman class for next year's Harvard team. Besides Rouse, the  Crimson will welcome Laurent Rivard (Northfield Mount Hermon), Ugo Okam  (Montverde Academy), Matt Brown (Northfield Mount Hermon), James Moore  (Jesuit High), and Monty Brown (Hotchkiss School).

They may have been ranked among the,  well, less desirable in FlyBy’s house  reviews, but Winthrop certainly  knows how to show some house spirit: for a third time consecutively—and  13th time since 1935—Winthrop has again claimed the Straus  Cup, the House Intramural Program championship trophy.
Winthrop IM Tutor Maria C. M. Persson  Gulda first announced the result over the house list Thursday.
“I think we won again first because  we’ve had great participation,” said Andrew M. Prince '10, one of Winthrop’s  IM representatives. “We didn’t forfeit a single game.”
Persson Gulda cited the house’s IM  representatives as another key factor in the house’s success. “They  are very enthusiastic about it, they bring out a lot of people in the  house, they are very good athletes themselves, and they are very good  leaders,” she said.
Winthrop was ranked at the top of each  of the three seasons of play, according to the Intramural Program website.
Prince said he and others in Winthrop  were not surprised with the victory. “People were excited, ecstatic,  but not too surprised,” he said, citing the high levels of participation  and spirit surrounding IM sports in the house.
“At least as important as winning  the Straus Cup is having people out there, participating, and meeting  their fellow housemates,” said Prince.
Winthrop celebrated the victory yesterday  with a barbeque. “We had a grill out on the patio, and a lot of people  were there from the house,” said Persson Gulda.
The Straus Cup will be presented to  Winthrop at 6 p.m. today in the Murr Center, along with awards for IM  Athletes of the Year Kelly N. Bodwin ’11 of Kirkland House and Charles  T. James ’10 of Leverett House.
“We are very excited that the Cup  will come back to the dining hall because that spot is very empty right  now,” said Persson Gulda.
The Straus Cup's announcement follows  Eliot’s wins of three out of four of the men and women’s IM crew races  on May 6, ceding only the women’s B race to Leverett. As a result,  Eliot receives the Agassiz Cup, for victory in men’s A crew, and the Stone Plate for victory in women’s A crew.
“We actually christened our boat  the ‘Lino Pertile’—and put the lettering on the bow—before the  races in honor of his support and enthusiasm,”said Josef N. Tofte  ‘10, one of Eliot’s IM crew captains, in an e-mail. Pertile, one  of Eliot’s outgoing House Masters, "has been a fantastic proponent  of Eliot Boat Club, and was really our inspiration this year,”   said Tofte.

Harvard University Dining Services has heard your pleas, and Korean BBQ will be back on the menu starting Tuesday, May 11 thanks to popular demand.
According to HUDS Director for Culinary Operations Martin T. Breslin, Korean BBQ was part of the winter seasonal menu and was phased out with other winter items when the spring menu came in. But student feedback that was gathered by word of mouth and the spring survey showed HUDS that students still need their fix. “It’s been a great hit,” said Breslin.
At the Harvard Top Chef competition last Monday, Breslin also said that, contrary to some of the rumors that have been circulating, Korean BBQ was not actually taken off the menu due to too much demand.
Start fasting now.

Tired of getting kicked out of Widener at 10 p.m.? Can't escape the Law School Library? Is Lamont feeling like too much of a party? We understand what you're going through. In order to make this reading period slightly more bearable, we've found some hidden treasures on campus for those late-night cramming sessions.
Winthrop's "The Owen Room"
Located on the first floor of G entryway, the Owen Room's long tables, chairs, and blackboard create the perfect environment for group study. For those interested in private or casual study, the adjoining lounge's couches and plush chairs provide a great place to take care of that reading (and sleeping) you've been putting off this term. If you're out of Board Plus and not interested in spending your life savings in Lamont Café, the Owen Room's proximity to the dining hall makes this room a perfect home base for prolonged study.
Winthrop's "The Feer Room"
If the Owen Room fills up (or if you just need a change of scenery), head over to the Feer Room in C entryway. This study space provides all of the same amenities as the Owen Room's main classroom but in a slightly more intimate setting. For those tired of the industrial lighting of basement seminar rooms, the natural light streaming through the Feer Room's two large, arched windows is a refreshing change.
Kirkland Seminar Room
 
Located in the basement of K entryway, this study space is perfect for those interested in eliminating all distraction. Though the Kirkland Seminar Room is only furnished with several tables and chairs, its simplicity provides the perfect setting for major accomplishment over the course of a short period of time.
 
Eliot Grille
 Those interested in less focused study should check out the Eliot Grille. Located in the basement of J entryway, the Grille's couches make this a great place for leisurely study (though the TV and Foosball table ensure that little will actually occur). The Grille itself is only open Wednesday through Saturday, but a wide selection of snacks are available from four basement vending machines 24/7.

At about 7:30 p.m. this evening, FlyBy got a tip that Winthrop intramural representatives would be venturing to the Quad to celebrate their third consecutive year in winning the House Intramural Program championship.
Well, they didn't quite make it to the Quad.
 Instead, we caught up with the winners after their parade through some of the River Houses just as they were securing the Straus Cup in the Winthrop dining hall trophy case. 

 "We were just having a lot of fun," said Andrew M. Prince '10, one of the Winthrop intramural chairs, who helped lead the march through Eliot, Leverett, Quincy, and Kirkland dining halls.
Though their chants didn't quite make it to Mather, Dunster, or the Quad, Prince said they did make an attempt to appear in Lowell, but they were stopped at the entrance due to dining hall restrictions.
 Alexander J. Ahmed '10, another IM chair, said that this trophy signified a more objective ranking system of House achievement. 
"We expect the same results next year," said Nicholas G. Purcell '11, the junior IM chair.
 "It was all good-natured fun," Prince said.
