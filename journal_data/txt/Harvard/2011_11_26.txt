After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite outshooting Dartmouth, 37-26, on Friday night, the Harvard men’s hockey team left Hanover, N.H., with a 3-3 tie.
Senior forward Alex Killorn and junior forward Alex Fallstrom each registered six shots, while junior defenseman Danny Biega tallied two assists in the draw.
“We thought we outplayed them the whole game,” sophomore Dan Ford said. “We were disappointed with the result, but we were overall happy with the way that we played. We thought we played well and were deserving of a better result.”
In the 196th matchup between the two squads, the Crimson (3-3-2, 2-3-2 ECAC) jumped out to an early lead in the sixth minute of action when freshman forward Mike Seward netted his first career goal. The rookie blasted a wrist shot into the back of the net from in front of the Big Green goal while on a rush. On the day, Seward also recorded a game-high nine faceoff wins.
Dartmouth (4-4-1, 3-3-1) responded by scoring midway through the first period. Big Green freshman Tyler Sikura intercepted a pass before firing a slap shot over the pads of Harvard goalie Steve Michalek.
Early in the second, Dartmouth scored on a high wrist shot fired off the stick of sophomore Eric Robinson to take a 2-1 lead.
On its first power-play opportunity later in the same frame, Harvard would post a response of its own. With 12 minutes to play in the second period, Dartmouth freshman Jesse Beamish was called for a hooking penalty. Thirty seconds later, Fallstrom delivered the puck to the back of the Big Green net.
Just prior to the score, Dartmouth senior goaltender James Mello blocked Killorn’s shot, but the Harvard forward handled the deflection and found Fallstrom waiting across the ice. Mello could not stop Fallstrom’s shot—the team’s fourth attempt of the power play—tying the game at two.
“The power play came up huge for us in the second period,” Ford said. “Dartmouth went up, 2-1 and 3-2, and our power play answered back in both cases. They’ve scored a lot of big goals all year, and they continued [Friday].”
The home team regained its lead four minutes later on a breakaway goal by Big Green senior Doug Jones. Jones had the one-on-one opportunity with Michalek after a Crimson defenseman, skating backwards, tripped over a referee, losing control of the puck. The senior finished the play by squeezing a backhand attempt past Michalek.
But once again, Harvard rallied on its next man-advantage. Following a Dartmouth elbowing penalty, Crimson junior Luke Greiner knotted the game at three. Greiner redirected a shot originally fired by freshman defenseman Colin Blackwell from just inside the blue line. The equalizer was one of Harvard’s 15 second-period shots.
After the back-and-forth four-goal second period, the third frame was much calmer. The Crimson would get off fewer than half as many shots in the third period as the team took in the second, and the Big Green would record even fewer than Harvard. Mello and Michalek took over, keeping the game knotted at three.
“Both teams had a couple chances, but overall, the game tightened up a little bit,” Ford said. “Both teams were playing more conservative, and both goalies made a couple of big saves to keep the score tied at three.”
Overtime gave the more-than-4000 fans in attendance another defensive display. Both teams combined for only seven shots in five minutes of action, and once again, neither could score.
In the game, Dartmouth was slapped with four penalty calls, while Harvard only committed one infraction.
As the buzzer sounded to finish off the tie, each team earned a point in the standings. The draw, Dartmouth’s first and Harvard’s second, kept the Big Green one point ahead of the Crimson in the ECAC standings early in the year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming into the inaugural Battle 4 Atlantis tournament this week, nearly every expert predicted a matchup between No. 4 UConn and No. 22/20 Florida State on the tournament’s final day.
Turns out, the pundits were dead-on, as the Huskies and Seminoles will meet Saturday in a highly-anticipated Big East versus ACC contest.
But there’s a catch—that matchup will come in the consolation game. Instead, Harvard and Central Florida—one day after each pulled off upsets that grabbed the attention of the college basketball world—will play for the tournament’s championship at 4:30 p.m.
The Crimson (5-0) is coming off a grind-it-out, defense-heavy 46-41 win over Florida State, its second-straight victory over a BCS conference school after it thrashed the Pac-12’s Utah, 75-47, on Thanksgiving night.
“We really dug in, and we had to,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “I think our guys knew we had to be dependent on one another, had to have each other’s backs, had to fight, scrap, and claw. We needed a group effort on the defensive end.”
The Knights (4-1) topped College of Charleston, 74-63, on Thursday, then stunned UConn with its 68-63 win after trailing by 17 in the second half.
“We never tucked our heads and we just kept fighting,” UCF coach Donnie Jones said. “We were fortunate the ball bounced our way down the stretch, and we found a way to win a great basketball game.”
The Knights are led by junior forward Keith Clanton, who has averaged a double-double of 19.3 points and 10.0 rebounds per game through four contests this year, including 20 points against the Huskies and a career-high 28 against Charleston.
Clanton will prove a tough matchup inside for Crimson co-captain Keith Wright. The senior leads a balanced Harvard squad with 14.0 points and 6.8 rebounds per contest, while his frontcourt mate, junior Kyle Casey, is second on the team with 13.0 points and 5.5 rebounds.
Wright and Casey held their own against Florida State’s athletic, lengthy big men on Friday—helping the Crimson outrebound the Seminoles, 40-30—but both fell into foul trouble early, something they will need to avoid doing if Harvard is going to emerge with a win against UCF.
“I think our bigs, in their hedging, and what they were doing [yesterday] contesting shots at the rim, and also getting a lot of defensive rebounds and not giving up a lot of second-chance points, was key to shutting everyone down,” co-captain Oliver McNally said.
The Knights’ best perimeter player is junior Marcus Jordan. Though not quite as talented as his father Michael, Marcus has emerged as one of the best guards in Conference USA, averaging 16.3 points per game thus far this year. The junior scored 20 to go with seven rebounds and seven assists against UConn, despite facing one of the best backcourts in the country in sophomores Jeremy Lamb and Shabazz Napier.
Jordan will likely be matched up with junior Brandyn Curry, who had five assists and five steals Thursday and is considered the team's best perimeter defender.
“Brandyn is our best playmaker,” Amaker said. “We always want the ball in his hands.”
Sophomores Isaiah Sykes and Tristan Spurlock also average double figures in points for the Knights, as do McNally and sophomore Laurent Rivard for Harvard.
If the Crimson is to win, it will certainly need to improve upon yesterday’s 27.3 percent shooting percentage, which came during a contest in which the two squads combined for the lowest single-half point total in the shot clock era.
UCF, for its part, lost, 73-50, to Florida State two weeks ago. But that defeat shouldn’t comfort Harvard, as the Knights looked like a completely different team in storming back to defeat the defending national champions Friday.
If the Crimson can win, it will mark an early triumphant moment for a squad that has big goals for itself this season. A championship would be an especially meaningful one for Amaker, after the coach—staring at an unimpressive non-conference schedule largely because many BCS schools elected not to face a Crimson squad that was expected to be among the best mid-majors in the country—pushed for Harvard’s inclusion in the field.
The Battle 4 Atlantis is the Crimson’s first regular season tournament in the Amaker era, and Harvard’s win over Florida State was its first over a ranked opponent since it beat No. 17 Boston College in Jan. 2009. With a win tomorrow, the Crimson—which garnered three votes in the most recent AP poll—will put itself in strong discussion for the Top 25, which would be another first for the program.
“We are thrilled to be in the position we are,” Amaker said. “I am very pleased with the effort that our guys have shown at the Battle 4 Atlantis. ... We are very happy to be competing for the championship title at this time of the year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PARADISE ISLAND, Bahamas—The Harvard men’s basketball team may be known for its prowess on the offensive end, but Friday night, the Crimson showed that its defense can be a force to be reckoned with too.
In the semifinals of the first-ever Battle 4 Atlantis tournament, the Crimson held Florida State to just 41 points, more than 35 points below their season average en route to a 46-41 victory.
“We really dug in, and we had to,” said Amaker of his squad’s defense. “We had to fight, scrap, and claw.”
Harvard held Florida State to 36 percent shooting from the field and forced 16 turnovers. It was the Crimson’s stingiest defensive performance of the season.
Co-captain Oliver McNally played a crucial role in the Crimson’s defensive effort. The 6'3 guard was charged with the task of defending the Seminoles’ leading scorer, Michael Snaer, a 6'5 guard with the ability to stroke it from beyond the arc,
McNally held Snaer, who was coming off an 18-point performance against the University of Massachusetts on Thursday, to just 10 points on a team-high nine attempts from the field.
“I just tried to force him into tough shots and contested jumpers and not give anything easy and not put him on the foul line,” said McNally, who finished with a team-high seven points.
The Crimson also had success stopping Florida State veteran Bernard James. James, a 6'10 forward who entered yesterday’s matchup averaging 9.8 points per game, was held to just five points on eight field goal attempts.
CRASHING THE BOARDS
After getting outrebounded in each of its first two contests of the 2011-12 season, the Crimson has managed to control the glass. For the third straight game, Harvard out-rebounded its opponent last night, pulling down 40 boards compared to the Seminoles’ 30.
Co-captain Keith Wright led the Crimson’s efforts on the glass, notching a game-high eight rebounds in just 22 minutes of play. McNally finished second in rebounding, securing six boards. Freshman Steve Moundou-Missi came off the bench and secured five rebounds.
Florida State was anchored on the glass by James and Xavier Gibson, who pulled down six boards apiece. But the pair's efforts were not enough.
“[Harvard's] toughness, their ability to execute their defensive game plan and block us out and really being much more aggressive on the boards was, I thought, significant on the outcome of the game,” Seminoles’ coach Leonard Hamilton said.
In total, the Crimson pulled down 11 offensive rebounds and scored seven second-chance points on the night.
BENCH MARK
By the final buzzer, nine different Harvard players had seen the court for at least 10 minutes of play.
With Wright and junior forward Kyle Casey struggling with foul trouble throughout the contest, Amaker was forced to rely on his bench early and often.
Moundou-Missi and rookie wing Wes Saunders gave the Crimson solid minutes, finishing with six points and five rebounds and seven points and three rebounds, respectively.
But Moundou-Missi and Saunders weren’t the only Harvard substitutes to see significant minutes. In 24 minutes off the bench, sophomore Laurent Rivard notched six points on a pair of late three-pointers.
Rivard, who started the game 0-of-5 from beyond the arc, converted his first three with 8:12 to play in the game. The triple extended the Crimson’s lead to 29-24. Rivard followed up minutes later with his second trey, giving Harvard an eight-point lead.
“We have an incredible amount of confidence in [Rivard’s] shooting ability,” Amaker said.  “Laurent has a green light on our team. I felt that he was going to make some big shots and he did.”
Rivard has gotten his sophomore campaign off to a hot start. Through five games, the sharpshooter is averaging 10 points per game on 55 percent shooting from deep.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PARADISE ISLAND, Bahamas—For years, Harvard men’s basketball was nothing but an afterthought.
Ever since former Michigan and Seton Hall coach Tommy Amaker took the helm of the Crimson in 2007, expectations have steadily been rising. Harvard won its first-ever Ivy title last season and is the favorite to repeat this year and head to its first NCAA tournament since 1946.
Even so, few expected this.
Amidst an eight-team field that included No. 4 Connecticut and No. 22 Florida State, the Crimson emerged as the top dog with a 59-49 victory over Central Florida in the Battle 4 Atlantis championship on Saturday.
Junior forward Kyle Casey had 15 points and a season-high nine rebounds, and senior forward and tournament MVP Keith Wright added 12 points and seven boards for the Crimson (6-0), which upset the Seminoles, 46-41, on Friday and is off to its best start since 1984-1985.
“We’ve been building towards something like this,” Amaker said. “We’ve talked about and worked toward it, but we certainly needed to see it happen, and it certainly happened for us here.”
Opening the game on an 8-1 run, Harvard never trailed. After two layups by Keith Clanton cut the Crimson’s lead to 12-7, Harvard buried two three-pointers to establish a double-digit lead and went on to close the first half with a 10-2 run.
Casey finished the spurt with a tip-in of his own missed layup, helping his squad carry a 33-18 lead into the break.
The Knights (4-2) missed their final six shots of the half and were held to 33 percent shooting for the game.
“Our defense has been our calling card all season,” Amaker said. “I’m very proud and pleased with the way our kids have bought into that end of the floor. Our belief, our system, and our identity start with our defense.”
Keith Clanton had 12 points for Central Florida, which came back from 17 points down to beat the Huskies in Friday’s semifinals, 68-63.
Michael’s youngest son Marcus Jordan had 10 points but went 0-for-7 to start the game. Clanton and Jordan entered the game as two of the top four scorers in the entire tournament, averaging 24 and 18.5, respectively.
“We just didn’t do a good job finishing shots,” Knights coach Donnie Jones said. “We had some easy opportunities early on, and we got frustrated with ourselves because we weren’t scoring.”
The Crimson lead grew as large as 19 early in the second half on layups by co-captain Wright and freshman Steve Moundou-Missi. Casey and Wright struggled with foul trouble all game but managed to hold Clanton to 5-of-16 shooting and led Harvard to a 38-37 rebounding advantage.
“We wanted to have an inside presence established on both ends of the floor,” Amaker said. “It’s critical that we get [Casey and Wright] to lead the way for us around the rim—protecting the rim and also rebounding the basketball. Certainly they did a terrific job of that this afternoon.”
Two minutes into the second half, Clanton drained his only three-pointer of the night and Jordan scored his first basket on a fast-break layup, helping spark an 11-2 run that brought the Knights back within 10.
But Casey snapped a five-minute scoreless stretch for Harvard with a baseline runner and a drive to the basket to pull the Crimson back up by 14.
“Thank goodness we had the cushion that we had,” Amaker said. “Our toughness down the stretch and belief in what we were doing ... was critical for us.”
The Knights’ hopes of a comeback were thwarted by their own struggles at the charity stripe. Central Florida went 8-for-23 from the free throw line.
And while Harvard went cold from the floor—hitting only four field goals in the second half—Central Florida could not keep its opponent off the line, where it made 23 of 35 free throw attempts for the game.
A layup by Isaiah Sykes cut the deficit to 58-47 with 38 seconds left, but Casey hit two free throws and Central Florida missed a pair of late three-pointers.
The Knights turned 13 turnovers into 19 points and outscored Harvard in the paint, 34-22.
