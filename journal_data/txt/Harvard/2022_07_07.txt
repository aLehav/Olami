After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 83 percent of students admitted to Harvard College’s Class of 2026 will matriculate this fall, the College announced Wednesday.
The class will include record-high proportions of women, Asian Americans, first generation college students, and Native American and Hawaiian students, according to data released by the school.
The yield rate marks a decrease from last year, when a record-high 85 percent of admitted students joined the Class of 2025.
More than 61,200 students applied for admission to the Class of 2026, up almost 7 percent from the previous year’s record of over 57,000. More than 1,950 students received offers of admission, setting a record low acceptance rate of just 3.13 percent.
“The Class of 2026 has demonstrated great promise for the future at a time of pandemic and economic uncertainty,” Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said in a press release. “Harvard is fortunate these students have chosen to come here, and we are looking forward to their arrival.”
Women comprise a record-high 55 percent of the incoming class, up almost 3 percentage points from the Class of 2025.
Asian Americans make up 27.6 percent of the class, 2 percentage points higher than the previous record, set by the Class of 2023. The increase comes as the Supreme Court is set to take up a lawsuit from the anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions accusing Harvard of discriminating against Asian American applicants.
African American students comprise 14.4 percent of the class, roughly on par with the Class of 2025. 11.9 percent of the incoming class identifies as Latinx, virtually identical to the 11.7 percent of the Class of 2025 and 11.8 percent of the Class of 2024. Native Americans and Hawaiians make up a record high 3.6 percent of the incoming class, up significantly from the 1.5 percent of the Class of 2025.
A record-high 19.4 percent of the class will be first generation college students, an increase from the 18.6 percent of the Class of 2025. The class of 2026 includes 14 veterans, a decrease from the 18 in the Class of 2025. Thirty-two incoming students expressed interest in ROTC.
Harvard announced an expansion of its financial aid program in April, raising the threshold of zero-cost attendance from $65,000 to $75,000 of annual income. About 24 percent of the Class of 2026 falls under the threshold, in line with the rest of the College.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Standing in front of a colorful mural commemorating his late aunt, Rita Hester, Taufiqul Chowdhury took the microphone, turned to the artist, Rixy, and thanked her.
“You were able to capture so much beauty,” he said. “Rita loved animals, she loved cheetah print — she has so much cheetah print. Roses mean so much to our family and to Rita and to her mother, so to see those roses means the world to us.”
The City of Boston unveiled a mural last week depicting Hester, a transgender woman whose murder in Allston in November 1998 sparked the creation of Transgender Day of Remembrance.
The mural is located at 506 Cambridge Street in Allston. During the event, Rixy said she chose to name the piece “Rita’s Spotlight” to reflect how she wants viewers to see Hester.
“We’re all just admiring her and seeing her under her own light. It’s not about everybody else right now,” she said. “That confidence, that glow — that is so inspirational on its own.”
In an interview following the unveiling, Rixy said she agreed to work on Hester’s mural because she believed it deserved “so much care and love.”
“I really took this on because I felt like it aligned so much with my values, with what I felt like was necessary for Rita and the people around her that loved her the most,” she said.
Boston’s former artist-in-residence, Golden, first proposed the idea for the mural. In a June 22 press release, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu ’07 announced that the City of Boston had commissioned a mural in Allston honoring Hester as part of its Transformative Public Art Program.
To produce the mural, the city collaborated with the Boston Art Commission — an independent group of volunteers housed in the mayor’s Office of Arts and Culture that approves and commissions public artwork — and Street Theory, an artist-led agency that produces street art.
“This mural is a wonderful way to acknowledge the contributions of Rita Hester and Boston’s LGBTQIA+ community as a whole, and we’re so excited to bring this mural to the Allston neighborhood during Pride Month,” Wu wrote in the press release. “Whether it’s youth walking by on their way to school, or residents visiting local businesses in the area, we’re confident that this mural will continue to inspire and uplift the surrounding community for years to come.”
Rixy said in the interview she hopes the mural will create a “safe space” for people.
“I’m hoping that if maybe the rest of the world isn’t safe, at least the 50 feet right beside this wall is for you,” Rixy said. “That wall, the mural, the image represents you, represents that family so all of y’all are welcome to be safe and comfortable right here.”
As a lifelong resident of Allston-Brighton, Rosie C. Hanlon said she remembered Hester’s life and death.
“She knew who she was and what she wanted, and she wasn’t afraid to make that statement,” she said. “I think that she was a pioneer to having people accept who we are and why we are without judgment, and that’s pretty amazing.”
Chowdhury said that while Hester’s murder was never solved, she now “lives on in a different way” through the mural.
“The murderer is still out there,” he said. “Who knows, maybe that person has to pass by this every single day.”
Chowdhury said he hopes younger people will pass by the mural and see someone “powerful” who they might “see in themselves.”
The artwork will provide a space for people to convene, said Hanlon, who works as the administrative coordinator for the Jackson Mann Community Center, which is adjacent to the mural.
“It opens up a whole new avenue of potential and a way to unite people, which I think is really important,” she said. “That’s community, isn’t it?”
Rixy, a Roxbury native, said she is “very passionate” about working on local Massachusetts art projects like the Hester mural, which she said strive to empower “women and femme voices.”
“These are our stories, these are our walls, that’s our money,” she said. “We’re the ones that really need to be making this work happen.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Student borrowers reached a settlement with the U.S. Department of Education last month that will cancel around $6 billion in student loans across a group of more than 200,000 people if approved by a federal judge.
Seven students first brought the suit against the U.S. Department of Education under Betsy DeVos in June 2019, when the department stopped processing borrower defense applications. In October 2019, U.S. District Judge William H. Alsup certified a class of more than 200,000 student borrowers seeking relief from some or all of their federal student loan debt who claim their school misled them or acted illegally.
The plaintiffs in the case are represented by attorneys from the Project on Predatory Student Lending of the Legal Services Center of Harvard Law School — which seeks to represent students against for-profit colleges — and the California-based legal nonprofit Housing and Economic Rights Advocates.
On July 28, the court will hold an initial hearing to decide whether or not to approve the settlement. If the court grants preliminary approval, the Department of Education will notify class members, who can then comment on the settlement agreement. After reviewing comments, the court will hold a final hearing in fall 2022.
Eileen Connor, the director of the Project on Predatory Student Lending and a plaintiff attorney on the case, lauded the settlement in a press release from the organization on June 23.
“This momentous proposed settlement will deliver answers and certainty to borrowers who have fought long and hard for a fair resolution of their borrower defense claims after being cheated by their schools and ignored or even rejected by the government,” she said.
Joseph Jaramillo, a senior attorney at HERA who represented the plaintiffs alongside Connor, said in the press release that the settlement, if approved, can have a wide-ranging impact across the country.
“Our clients have been waiting years for justice and this settlement has the potential to make a life-changing difference for tens of thousands of people and their families,” he said.
U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel A. Cardona, who took over as the defendant in the suit after DeVos resigned in January 2021, wrote in a June 22 statement that the Department of Education believes the settlement will bring fair relief to borrowers.
“Since day one, the Biden-Harris Administration has worked to address longstanding issues relating to the borrower defense process,” he said. “We are pleased to have worked with plaintiffs to reach an agreement that will deliver billions of dollars of automatic relief to approximately 200,000 borrowers and that we believe will resolve plaintiffs’ claims in a manner that is fair and equitable for all parties.”
Connor said in the press release that the settlement will help provide future students with a path to navigating student loans.
“It will not only help secure billions of dollars in debt cancellation for defrauded students, but charts a borrower defense process that is fair, just, and efficient for future borrowers,” she said.
